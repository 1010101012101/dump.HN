Stock google camera app (based on ICS).<p>""chmod 0600 /dev/exynos-mem"" works well. The file permissions then shows crw------- as expected. The camera app still works fine. I tried recording videos and capturing pictures and was successful (1080p & 8MPx settings). Looking at the file permission after launching the camera app still shows no change (i.e. if it was 0600, it remains 0600). However, when I reboot the phone, the file's permission returns to 666. I have done this entire process three times just to be sure, and the file's permissions always returns to the default values.<p>Might need to look into it further, but frankly I don't have the time nowadays.",1355684353

Again, never used PL/I, so I can't roll on that one, but I know guys who have been doing FORTRAN since the seventies and that culture and outlook bears little resemblance to the C community. Java's community is not nearly as buttoned-up and business-centric as COBOL's was (even the oh-so-wise ""scripting people"" aside); COBOL had literally-literally no other significant use case. And PHP, for all its many warts, is viewed as a language you use to ship products, novice or no. Actual products that people use, no less.

4929129,comment,4928812,4929012,5,0,tokenadult,,,"From the article: ""People will be fluent in every language. With DARPA and Google racing to perfect instant translation, it won't be long until your cellphone speaks Swahili on your behalf."" That was suggested as a plausible prediction for 2022. The comment to which I reply says,<p><i>Given the current state of language translating software, I think this is highly unlikely in the next 10 years. Anyone who is bilingual and has used a translation app knows how woefully inadequate it is for actual communication.</i><p>The last time a video demonstration of software in development for language translation was posted here on HN,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4759620"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4759620</a><p>I commented,<p><i>To someone who spent years learning Chinese as a second language, and then made my living for years as a Chinese-English interpreter, that was pretty impressive.</i><p><i>The economics of the issue is that a machine interpreter just has to be as good as a human interpreter at the same cost. That's a reachable target with today's computer technology. EVERY time I've heard someone else interpreting English or Chinese into the other language, I have heard mistakes, and I am chagrined to remember mistakes that I made over the years. We can't count on error-free machine interpretation between any pair of languages (human language is too ambiguous in many daily life cases for that), but if companies develop tested, validated software solutions for consecutive interpreting (what I usually did, and what is shown in the video) or simultaneous interpreting (the harder kind of interpreting in demand at the United Nations, where even in the best case it is not always done well), then those companies will be able to displace a lot of human professionals who rely on their language ability to make a living.</i><p>And relating that comment to a timeline appropriate for today's thread, I think ten years out is about right for a mobile app widely available at reasonable cost that will displace human interpreters for most use cases that now require human interpreters. As I further commented on the the earlier thread 37 days ago,<p><i>Right now a lot of interpreters in the United States make a lot of part-time income from gigs that involve suddenly getting telephone calls and joining in to interpret a telephone conversation in two languages. This is often necessary, for example, for physician interviews of patients in emergency rooms or pharmacist consultations with patients buying prescribed drugs (where I last saw a posted notice on how to access such an interpretation service). The IBM Watson project is already targeted at becoming an expert system for medical diagnosis, and patient care markets will surely provide a lot of income for further development of software interpretation between human languages.</i><p><i>It's still good for human beings to spend the time and effort to learn another human language (as so many HN participants have by learning English as a second language). That's a broadening experience and an intellectual delight. But just as riding horses is more a form of recreation these days than a basis for being employed, so too speaking another language will be a declining factor in seeking employment in the next decade.</i><p>If there is economic demand for interpreting between a given language pair, there will be great economic incentive to develop software-as-a-service to do interpreting for that language pair. I would expect Japanese-English and Spanish-English and Chinese-English interpreting all to decline as a human paying occupation by ten years from now, even though international communication will surely increase in the same time frame.",1355683865

Global warming will have some change but won't kill all seaside cities. This is because either through market forces (likely) or unified global political action (unlikely), we fix it.<p>Wars: check.

We are the publishers of Exo IDE, at <a href=""http://cloud-ide.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cloud-ide.com/</a>   We are a cloud IDE, with a focus on enabling creation of apps that will ultimately be deployed to the cloud.<p>On any given week, we have up to 2000 projects that can be created.  Those projects can either be bound to a production PAAS or, in some cases, ""no PAAS"" can be selected.  For the large majority of projects, a production PAAS is selected at the time of creation.<p>Of the projects that select a PAAS, we see about 60% of those projects select GAE.  This is a number that surprises us, as while we know that GAE is a leader in the PAAS space, not sure that it's a 60% share holder as a relative fraction on the number of PAAS projects created each week.  While we haven't published any case studies, we do have a number of projects that have been published to GAE in a production sense.  We've collected this data through interviews and surveys.<p>Some things that may explain the results:\n1) We do not have complete PAAS coverage.  We do not have Rackspace or dotCloud, for example, and we just added AWS Beanstalk in the past two months.  So maybe there is a normalization of the data that needs to occur.<p>2) We provide GOOG oAuth as a logon mechanism.  That binding, could imply an overall tighter integration with GAE, and for developers who are PAAS agnostic, may encourage them to select GAE over other selections.<p>3) We provide a Chrome Store plug-in, to make configuration even easier.  We do get some people who indicate they wish to do everything within the Google realm.<p>4) We have spent time doing co-marketing with Google, so we may have gotten an unusual influx of people who were already looking at GAE.  But our referrer metrics indicate that the large number of referrers we get are people from Facebook, Twitter, GigaOM, TechCrunch, and direct.<p>We will watch this thread for the full conversation as we are interested in hearing about other projects.",1355683433

When you're successful, build out manual infrastructure, sure, but at initial launch it's often worth the tradeoff of potential downtime for the savings in manpower.<p>Naturally, if your startup is a backup service or something else where having as close to 100% uptime as possible is a truly key feature, then it's probably not in your best interests to rely on Heroku/AWS.",1355683365

Try a few decades.<p>In the 1940s, the USA fought totalitarianism.  Then we had a major fight against Communism.  In both struggles, a major part of our self image is that we, unlike the totalitarian states we struggled against, were a free country.  If, in a movie in the 70s, you saw the German officer saying, ""Papers, please"", that was a sure sign that they were the enemy - not living in a free state.<p>Today we live in a state that would be instantly recognizable as a totalitarian state.  Just like past totalitarian states, the excuse is our security.  Do you think that I'm exaggerating?  20 years ago it was common to not need an ID to board a plane, with it being reasonably common that the person whose name was on the ticket was not the person holding the ticket.  (That would generally be because someone had bought someone else's return ticket because that was cheaper than buying a one-way ticket.)  Today you not only need ID, you go through a thorough search and most take it for granted that we might go through a virtual strip search to get onto the plane.<p>Can I make this worse?  Actually, I can.  Nobody will show you the law requiring ID to fly.  There was actually a lawsuit filed about this.  John Gilmore lost, and <i>STILL</i> didn't get to see the law.

I've travelled fairly extensively through that part of the world, and it is a beautiful place - minus the sand flies, of course.<p>I think it is a good instinct to be wary of new ideas, but not good to dismiss them out of hand. One of the things I liked about the Kiwi culture is the can-do attitude. People are happy to try things for the first time, and maybe fail, but somehow the culture gives people a rush of success. It's a unique and great feature of the society.<p>And it's that attitude of empiricism that we've somehow lost. We don't see political or social solutions as <i>experiments</i> we see them as set-in-stone moral mandates. Remote medication may be a terrible idea, but we don't know. It certainly leaves a bad taste in my mouth - but frankly, it's a better taste than the one left by the OP's heart-wrenching article. The possibility that the boy could be given the remote himself is a hopeful one, similar to how diabetics or even epileptics can learn to see danger coming and take steps to prevent it.<p>And the ""bright side"" to this, if it worked, is huge. This person could be a real part of society, living as happy a life as any of us, rather than living out his life locked in an institution. Permanent institutionalization is societies way to kill someone without actually killing them.<p>In other words, I feel that this solution could be more humane, far more humane, than life-long incarceration in a mental institution, and it's an experiment that is worth trying.<p>(Of course, I'm assuming that life in a mental institution is pretty terrible, which I suppose is not really a given.

Flash, Dreamweaver and Acrobat comes to mind.<p>Flash - Difficult to work with (I know most beginners struggle with it).\nDreamweaver - Bloated software that generates weird HTML code.\nAcrobat - Slow and bloated software. Can't a PDF reader be simpler ?<p>But as adrocknaphobia pointed out 'this isn't ""Adobe Brackets"", it's just ""Brackets""'. Turns out there's no hiding after-all.",1355680928

A population with a high birthrate will only achieve that dominance if the children remain in that population.  A variety of religious communities have been able to maintain high birth rates, but do not retain all of their children, and their children therefore do not maintain birth rate.<p>One way to think of this is that, instead of the physical birth rate of people with the trait, what is the rate with which the trait manages to reproduce itself?  A trait of ""being Mormon"" with an average of 6 kids, of whom 2 become Mormon, leads to a Mormon population of stable size, forever having 6 kids per couple.<p>If the Mormons manage an average of 2.5 Mormon kids per couple, then their population will grow without bound, though they may never be an actual majority of the population.  However history shows that culture is malleable.  They may grow that fast now, but a rapid social change can destroy the dynamic.  (Witness Italy and Ireland, both strongly Catholic, with declining populations.)<p>Now contrast this with, say, a genetic trait that manifests as a strong desire to actually have children.  Eventually you get a population of people who really want children, most of whose children really want children.  This type of fundamental desire is more stable than a social construct.<p>I believe that there are such traits out there in the population.  They are much more strongly favored today than in the past.  Eventually those traits, whatever they are, will become more widespread, and evolution will have happened.",1355680925

3062184,comment,3061261,3061705,1,0,shabble,,,"Mass residential here tends to spawn more and more speed-bumps over time as community action groups and similar demand ""safer roads"".  Even considering that, they're very common routes for taxis and private vehicles that want to avoid blockages or traffic-lights.  About the only thing they reduce is non-essential trucking.<p>To the other point, regardless of average traffic, it's perfectly possible there'll be a bit of a queue during peak commuting hour(s), and secondly, it seems quite odd that a whole neighbourhood could be disconnected by something like essential road-works or a fallen tree.<p>I'm with you on the somewhere-inbetween approach. Balancing accessibility, traffic density, noise, and fault resilience is tricky, but much moreso is the cost of alterations to existing neighbourhoods built on one style or the other.",1317535096

But it's hampered by a few bugs and mis-features that were baked into the language definition early (due to high pressure to release the language early and marketing pressure to make the syntax a certain way, even if it didn't make sense).

Thats why the position description suggests submitting code samples like a link to the github account would be very beneficial.<p>we do respond with an automated message acknowledging the receipt of the application and it spells out what to expect. We contact again to request code sample and exercise of those who pass initial screen. unfortunately sometimes those emails get trapped in spam filters.

OK, so you should've had a restriction in your BO. You add that restriction and move on.<p>Your DBA comes along and adds an integrity check or a trigger that makes the insertion fail if some weird condition is met. Your test passes, but you have a bug.<p>This can get even more interesting when you hit some basic database rule that you didn't even know it existed. You assume the insertion will work, but it won't.

Each of us needs to assess how best to spend our time in order to maximize our results, both in quantity and quality. If people think that spending fifty percent of their time writing tests maximizes their resultsokay for them. Im sure thats not true for meId rather spend that time thinking about my problem. Im certain that, for me, this produces better solutions, with fewer defects, than any other use of my time. A bad design with a complete test suite is still a bad design.</i><p>He said something on the similar lines about development on CLR:<p><i>Fogus: Clojure was once in parallel development on both the JVM and the CLR, why did you eventually decide to focus in on the former?\nHickey: I got tired of doing everything twice, and wanted instead to do twice as much.</i><p>His explanation on both fronts boil down to he doesn't find it(TDD and CLR/JVM parallel development) a worthy investment of time, given there are only so many hours in a day.<p>I don't understand why TDD advocates get all worked up when someone says TDD doesn't work from them. Well, if TDD is silver bullet of software development, they should be delighted that the ignorant singletons fail to see it and they have an edge over the fools.<p>These reactions remind of this:<p>You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence \nin.

I really don't see a problem with founders diversifying their personal portfolios (otherwise, many have 100% in company stock AND debt from school, etc.).  You don't want them to get distracted, but being short on cash doesn't help you make a successful product.<p>2) De-risking via a special dividend, vs. secondary sale of stock.  Yes, it lets founders avoid selling some shares.  If you're doing it at a $1b valuation, it doesn't seem like a major factor either way, but if there could be a precedent for people raising $20-50mm rounds, dividend vs. sale might be a better way to put $1-2mm in the pocket of each founder after a few years, so they can shoot for a >$1b exit.<p>I'm curious if this form was suggested by the AirBnB side (or their law firm) or the VCs.",1317532163

In Portland, you have people that want to live this lifestyle. They don't want the burden of the car, they are environmentally conscious, they work in the city, and they don't have kids. Sure, for them, it's doable (and you sound like one of them). This isn't usually the case. Industrial areas, where many people work, aren't dense enough to support frequent bus stops, and most families would have a hard time getting kids places without being able to drive them hither and thither.<p>I've lived in some of the densest cities in Europe, and families still had a hard time getting around without a car. At one point, I did get a car, and not having to deal with the scheduling hassles of public transportation made my life instantly easier.<p>You have to have an enormous population density for public transportation to be a break-even affair. Your Portland public transportation isn't self-sufficient, it's a net loss, and it's subsidized by taxes. Sure, it's more efficient than cars, but it still doesn't solve all the problems that cars do, as noted above (primarily for families). By the time you get the density required for public transportation to be self-sustaining, you're looking at a cost of living that is unacceptable for most families (eg, NYC).<p>Sure, public transportation is great for young single people. Try going to the grocery store with young kids on the bus. It's virtually impossible.",1317531720

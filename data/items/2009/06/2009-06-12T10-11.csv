654446,comment,653655,653655,0,0,DirtyAndy,,,"Personally I'm in the process of starting something and trying to focus on that as much as possible, but I still have lots of ideas. So I have a whiteboard in my office and when I get an idea it goes on the whiteboard. The whiteboard is divided into two sides - ideas that are fun but will never make a penny, and ideas that need further investigation to see if they are commercially viable.<p>Up until recently I have done contract development work. Nearly all of the ideas that I have that are on the potential money making list come from my work interactions. Either systems I have developed where 90% of the system would work for loads of other companies, or systems that the company wont develop but that the users want, that I think other companies would want.<p>I am assuming you are a programmer of some description (I assume most people on here are) in which case I think you are in the best position. Look at the systems you work on, Can they be improved, can they be generalised so that other companies may pay for them. It is amazing how many companies will take the $200 a month option where you cannot change the background colour to cyan over the fully customised internally built $20,000 option.Obviously be slightly careful that your company does not have rules where if you invent stuff whilst in their employment then they own it etc - but most companies don't seem to bother too much.<p>Your startup can accomplish boring business jobs and make money, it doesn't have to be a rip off of Facebook or aggregate Twitter data for you to have a happy life.<p>Good luck",1244803761

654440,comment,653809,653809,0,0,steerpike,,,"I think the main problem I have with this article and the entire way of thinking is the incredibly poor definition of a troll.<p>From their descriptions of a troll's comments, they make it seem like trolls are easy to spot and moderate when real trolls are often anything but.<p>The main focus of a troll is an attempt to game other human beings. That doesn't have anything to do with swearing or abusive language and it sure as hell isn't easy to spot.<p>Frankly, from the techniques described in the article, I think the only one that has a hope in hell of working against real trolls is the slashdot one. All the others are just casting a net over foul language and blatant stupidity.",1244803514
654439,comment,652669,653663,0,0,limmeau,,,"If a student has a reason to hand in an archived answer instead of learning something by solving the problem himself, there's already something going wrong, and creating fresh exercises each week attacks a symptom only.<p>Why do students use archived answers in the first place? Apparently, to get credits for (and ultimately pass) a course whose course points they need for something but whose contents they don't want to learn that badly that investing their own time would seem worthwhile.<p>I see two ways in which to attack this situation:<p>1. Remove the possibility of passing a course without having understood its contents: e.g. oral exams with ""why"" questions.<p>2. Remove the perceived necessity to get a good grade: on the small scale, the easier it is to cheat in a single test, the less it should contribute to the grade.  On the larger scale, perhaps curriculae need to be more diverse such that a ""I just want to be a Java programmer with a degree such that I earn more money"" student can become ""just a Java programmer with a degree in just Java"".",1244803485

654433,comment,653886,653886,0,0,coderdude,,,"In the meta description it says ""[..] Discover how fast and fun the Web can be."" so I assume it has to do with this feature in the newest version of Opera that, if I remember correctly, speeds-up surfing by serving you a faster version of a site than that site can serve it to you.

They will take the blame for this despite them preferring to have competing browsers available from a first run menu.<p>Microsoft clearly believes that a simple choice would be bad for them so they're making it so that a) the consumer who buys an OS has to go out and get a browser, and they're hoping Internet Explorer will get greater share than otherwise, and more importantly b) the OEMs will, in the main, install IE and only IE which has much more effect as that is how 95% of people get their OS, with a new machine purchase.",1244802338

In the former case there is a ton of possible ways to start a business, and some are listed in the linked article: you can become a consultant, you can set up a simple Web site etc. The same is true for the latter: instead of founding a company and looking for funding, you can sell the technology to another company, or simply license it etc.<p>I think that the quoted guy was attracted to the notion of a startup by the recent hype going on, and that he would like all the attention and ""lifestyle"" (or at least how he sees it), and is not really interested in building a valid business or technology.",1244801615

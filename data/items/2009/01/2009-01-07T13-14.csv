423402,comment,422816,422816,0,0,watmough,,,"I thought is was interesting that the calorific contribution  from oxidising the metal of the experimental chamber was estimated at 1% of produced energy. A decimal place can be, either here ... or here.<p>So many people want to believe that this can be true. However, like consistent 12% annual returns, and flying cars, it seems more likely that 'BlackLight Power' is more of a vehicle to fund Randall Mills retirement, than a real possibility of a revolutionary source of near-free energy.<p>Obviously, if it does turn out to be true, the scientific world may have to take his grand-unified theory a little bit more seriously.",1231336169

We might not have an Apple, because Jobs and Wozniak would have broken up as a technology 'couple' early on in their work.<p>Maybe something like this contributed to the original poster's failure to hit a home run in his decades of work.<p>This jibes with something it's taken me a long time to learn: sometimes, ""going along to get along"" really is the optimal path.",1231335851

423395,comment,423069,423154,0,0,davi,,,"That's right.  For me the new idea in this post is that after you realize that ""ideas are cheap"", you can continue on to see that ""execution is cheap"".  What's not cheap is <i>money</i>, which you use to polish, scale up, and market whatever you're building.<p>With modern web startups, money probably matters less, and execution, more, than in domains where you manufacture and distribute physical objects.",1231335392

Like Python, you can use both non-OOP and OOP styles. You can define your own packages and namespaces (unlike MATLAB where there's just one big namespace). There are hundreds of contributed packages, you don't need to buy separate toolboxes. Not to forget, it's GPL, you can look at the source and learn a few things from people who know what they're doing (to name a few: Brian Ripley, Terry Therneau, Douglas Bates, Bill Venables).<p>On the other hand, it can be a bit of a steep learning curve at the beginning, but I feel it's definitely worth it. It's not perfect, I stub my toe on obscure language features from time to time, but to paraphrase Winston Churchill, R is the worst form of statistical languages except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time...<p>I think that Andrew Robinson's introduction is pretty decent (<a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Robinson-icebreaker.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Robinson-icebreaker.pd...</a>), but there are many others at <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html</a>",1231335292

A three-column page with independent column heights would not be called ""the holy grail"" -- it would be effortless.<p>CSS sucks. (edit: So do tables. Really, HTML, CSS, and Javascript all sucks. Browsers suck. The web environment sucks. We use it because of what it lets us do, not because it's a friendly programming environment.)",1231335103

423385,comment,423147,423147,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Great article. Nice counterpoint to the usual ""Christians are trashing our world"" articles. It's written in an informal, conversational style, and the author is an outsider, giving him a different viewpoint than you usually hear.<p>Philosophically, switching from multiple deity worship to monotheism means groups of people begin to share common opinions about how their life and actions fit into a grander scheme. Switching further into a religion based on love and self-sacrifice means the individual is not the sole purpose of living (and neither is the state). Add to that the reformation, which underlined personal responsibility for dogma and spawned ongoing dogmatic renewal, and you've got a philosophy that puts common morals over self and continuously strives to re-adjust those morals to changing times.<p>This article reminds me of a comment by a Roman doctor, who observed that when the plague hit cities, doctors, priests, and acolytes would all flee into the hills for safety -- except for the Christians, of course, who would stay and tend to the sick.<p>Religions and the way we practice them have a lot of good and a lot of bad things associated with them. I'm not of the opinion that they are all good, or that they are all bad. I like to see opinions from both sides. I think we confuse the scientific method with the effects of beliefs, e.g., if by believing my neighbor's barn is red, I become happier and a greater contributor to society, it matters very little what <i>actual</i> color my neighbor's barn is. It's the belief, not the shared empirical consensus. (Of course, lots of problems occur when these clash, which means that longer-lasting faiths must rest on believing things that are not seen, cannot be observed in any fashion as one of the Pauline letters pointed out, I believe.)",1231334916
423384,comment,423147,423359,0,0,zby,,,"That is a rather deep subject and the perhaps the best answer is to redirect you to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard</a>. But I'll try a short answer here: scapegoat is the name of a general social mechanism - according to Rene Girard it is a way to relieve the violent tention inside a human group. Originally it was with human sacrifices - but later it became ritualized - and one form of this ritualization was using goats in the Jewish religion.  According to Girard Jesus was a scapegoat - but the Evangelies tell the story of the scapegoating from the point of view of it's victim - showing the whole injustice of it.",1231334823

While it is true that the government pays for most primary education, the vast majority of these funds do not come from federal or state taxes, but rather property tax.<p>If the government really wanted to create ""security"" in the financial system they would increase the reserve limit for banks to 25% and print bills to the difference in the money supply.<p>Roads, bridges, etc... do allow companies to move products - most employers are very happy to pay for these developments. Most of these, however, are paid with gas taxes and tolls (at least here in Canada).<p>The three points you mention cost money, but make up a tiny percent of the American budget. The main money leaches are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, and the military.

423376,comment,422823,422884,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I'm far from being militant about it, but one reason for conforming to specs is that it makes writing browsers more productive. So the people writing browsers can create new features or make their code faster instead of trying to keep up with all kinds of quirks in everyday HTML.<p>If one browser maker accepts a particular non-standard quirk, all others will have to follow. Sometimes this isn't a bad thing (XmlHTTPRequest) but it slows down browser development. Since browser makers can't keep up, web developers see browser incompatibilities and that makes them move to things like Fash/Flex.<p>So basically, the effect is that the web becomes more proprietary the more non-standard quirks have to be supported.<p>But still, there is clearly a tradeoff between conforming to standards, using what works to increase your own productivity, and experimenting with new things to innovate. It's not black and white in my view.",1231334116

423369,comment,422823,423324,0,0,tdavis,,,"I think pg would be less happy because he'd have to admit I was right about this whole silly standards thing ;)<p>As for your questions: The page bloat issue is pretty apparent: it takes a lot more markup to wrap everything in tables than it does to use floated / positioned block elements such as <div/>. Individually marking up each <font/> tag with color, bgcolor, etc. also wastes a shitload of bytes.<p>Accessibility is another issue entirely, but is generally hindered by inline Javascript because such JS is not based on progressive enhancement; rather, it directly hijacks events on specific elements rather than improving the experience for JS-enabled browsers. In the case of HN, it appears that ""vote"" links work with or without Javascript, though the latter loads a blank page after voting. This is certainly better than the alternative. Additionally, superfluous markup has a tendency to disrupt the functioning of assisted-reading devices such as screen readers.<p>There's a whole world of people out there advocating the use of web standards, all for very practical reasons. I'm not going to re-post all their thoughts and arguments here, but if you're not educated in the matter I highly recommend becoming so, if for no other reason than understanding what we crazy people are screaming about.  Many people far more dedicated than I have written countless articles on the matter; a good place to start would be Roger Johansson's blog: <a href=""http://www.456bereastreet.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.456bereastreet.com/</a> but there are many others.",1231333664

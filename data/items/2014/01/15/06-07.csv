It&#x27;s nice to see how other people do things.<p>A few suggestions which may save effort next time you do this:<p>- Only use the $ symbol as much as necessary.  Usually you only need one (e.g. $C12 or C$12 rather than $C$12), unless you&#x27;re referencing a single input.  In your example, the excessive use of $ on the &#x27;Detail&#x27; tab prevents me from adding an extra row for an employee simply by copying-and-pasting<p>- SUBTOTAL can be better than SUM for summing columns of numbers.  You want subtotals for Sales, Support etc., as well as a grand total.  SUBTOTAL can be applied to a whole column of values without fear of double-counting, as it ignore existing SUBTOTALs.<p>- EOMONTH(x,1) will give you the last day of the month after the date x.  EOMONTH(x,0)+1 will give you the first day of the month instead.  It&#x27;s a bit easier to read than your DATE(YEAR, MONTH+1, DAY) construction.",1389768746

7062023,comment,7061830,7061875,19,0,rallison,,,"The short answer is yes. The longer answer is that you also need virality. There are multiple coins released every day [1]. Most of these coins go nowhere.<p>Why are so many coins released? Quite simply, most coins are forks of Bitcoin/Litecoin/etc with minor tweaks. Occasionally, you get a truly new coin based on something new, but most simply tweak the coins per block, the difficulty re-targeting rate, the starting difficulty, the block time, etc. Coingen.io exemplifies how simple this is. Of course, there are exceptions, such as the upcoming Etherium [2], the first Turing complete cryptocurrency (as far as I know, at least).<p>Despite that, most coins basically fail. Sure, they receive hashing power, and some even get onto exchanges. Most of them, however, don&#x27;t really go anywhere.<p>So, yes, it is relatively easy to create and launch a coin. It is a bit harder to launch a coin that makes it to an exchange. It is harder still to make one that also sticks around and stays in the public consciousness (such as dogecoin).<p>Finally, let&#x27;s say you have a great idea for a new coin. The way some people previously got rich by creating a new coin was to premine the coin. Basically, one would mine the first x number of blocks, before releasing it. This still happens, but is now much more often frowned upon. So, to get rich off of creating a coin, you basically would need to premine a coin, and convince others that you had a good reason to premine it [3]. This absolutely still happens, but is becoming tougher to pull off.<p>So yes, you could create aarondfcoin. Yes, you could probably release it and get hashing power thrown at it. But, would you make money doing so? Well, that requires a bit more effort. Keep in mind that there are hundreds of attempted alt currencies for every dogecoin success.<p>That said, yes, there is still room for success here, but it usually requires more than just creating aarondfcoin. The virality aspect is the more important aspect, at the moment.<p>[1] See the bitcointalk announcement forum <a href""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159."" rel""nofollo"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0</a><p>[2] <a href""http://ethereum.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://ethereum.org/</a> and the whitepaper: <a href""http://ethereum.org/ethereum.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://ethereum.org/ethereum.html</a><p>[3] Yes, there are a still a number of ways to make money off of releasing a coin that doesn&#x27;t involve premining (or appears not to involve premining), but that is a topic worthy of its own thread.",1389768652

7061989,comment,7059919,7061371,3,0,rahimnathwani,,,"From quickly scanning the comments, it seems that (i) many people would use a tool like this, despite its lack of flexibility, because it&#x27;s easy to use and it works, (ii) very few had the same reaction as I did: it looks nice, but why not just use Excel.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve spent many, many hours using Excel (although less so these days), but those problems you state don&#x27;t seem like problems:<p>1) Fat-fingering is a problem only if you mix the task of coding (setting up the structure and formulae in Excel) with the task of using (changing the parameters).  You don&#x27;t code your web site at the same time as using it (except for manual testing), and it can be the same with Excel.  Highlight all input cells with a yellow background and blue font, unset their &#x27;Protected&#x27; property, and then lock the workbook.  You/anyone can then play to your heart&#x27;s content without worrying about messing up formulae.<p>2) When you are creating new versions of a spreadsheet, it&#x27;s either because you are changing the structure (e.g. changing formulae, adding columns) or because you are changing the input data.  If the latter then, yes, you can have several different versions.  I&#x27;ve managed this in the past (when fundraising and doing regular reviews with investors) by having an &#x27;Assumptions&#x27; tab which contains _all_ inputs.  Each scenario (set of assumptions) has a name/number and a column of its own.  The calculations and output dynamically reference just one scenario at a time depending on the scenario chosen from a drop-down.  Not only that, but Excel&#x27;s &#x27;Data tables&#x27; feature (which explicitly supports only one-variable or two-variable scenarios) works with this, even if you have 10s of variables: just set the scenario number as your variable.<p>3) Using a &#x27;template they found&#x27; is clearly a bad idea.  They wouldn&#x27;t just copy-paste some &#x27;code they found&#x27; without studying it and the tests.  In fact, for something simple, they&#x27;d probably just re-create their own after studying someone else&#x27;s code for something similar.  It&#x27;s the same with Excel files.<p>4) Can&#x27;t argue with this one :)<p>5) This last point intrigues me: until now I thought you were focused on business plans, and that you wouldn&#x27;t overwrite the historical data with actuals.

Abstract interpretation is essentially a fold (in the functional programming sense) of the IR for a language, where you can parameterize the particular operation applied to each node.  When the operation specified is &quot;evaluate&quot;, you get partial evaluation, as described in the Wikipedia article.<p>The interesting part of PyPy happens when the RPython program to be evaluated is itself a Python interpreter, which it is.  In this case, &#x27;prog&#x27; is the Python interpreter written in RPython, and Istatic is your Python program.  The first Futamura projection will give you a JIT; you specialize the RPython interpreter with your particular program, and it evaluates everything statically known at compile time (namely, your program) and produces an executable.<p>The second Futamura projection will give you a JIT <i>compiler</i>.  Remember, since RPython is a subset of Python, an interpreter for Python written in RPython could be interpreted by itself.  Moreover, it could be <i>compiled</i> by itself by the process described in the paragraph above.  When you compile your JIT through the same process, you get a program that means the same thing (i.e. it will translate a Python program into an executable) but runs faster.  The PyPy JIT that everybody&#x27;s excited about for running Python scripts faster is this executable.<p>The third Futamura projection involves running PyPy on the toolchain that generated PyPy.  Remember, this whole specializer machinery is all written in RPython, which can be interpreted by itself.  So when your run the specializer machinery through itself, you get - an optimized toolset for building JIT compilers.  That&#x27;s what made programming language theorists excited about PyPy long before the Python community was.  It&#x27;s not just &quot;faster Python&quot;, but it&#x27;s a toolset for building a JIT out of anything you can build an interpreter for.  Write an interpreter in RPython - for anything, Ruby, PHP, Arc, whatever - and run it through the PyPy toolchain, and it will give you a JIT compiler.",1389766090

CPU performance is largely unchanged and they wont be able to challenge Intel with the Bulldozer architecture which will be around until 2015.\nIts a very nice APU for Desktops that need some gaming/gpu chops, but nothing revolutionary as the Intel CPUs with integrated Iris Pro are in the same league when it comes to GPU performance and even outperform the Kaveri in many benchmarks.<p>HSA (Heterogenous System Architecture) has a lot of potential and could be a model for the future, if that works out with the market adopting remains to be seen though.",1389766051

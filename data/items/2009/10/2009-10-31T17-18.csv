In fact, I'd wager there's a hell of a lot more stuff that's debatable than most people would be comfortable knowing about.<p>I've said it before: I don't think any topics should be off-limits as long as people can reasonably discuss them. In fact, I think it's a test of a community to see what it can productively discuss and what it can't.<p>Startups are full of people acting under intense pressure with incomplete information. As such, these topics are just little baby toys, artificial constructs of arguments that have little real impact on people's lives. Being able to have reasonable conversations about emotional and important things with incomplete information is something we should all strive for, not something we should be afraid of.",1257011895

913793,comment,913551,913742,0,0,bendotc,,,"> Government spending does improve the economy, but not as much as tax cuts do. If you give money back to the market, it is guaranteed to be spent efficiently.<p>That's debatable.  For example, Moody's Economy believes otherwise (see page 9 of <a href=""http://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/Economic_Stimulus_House_Plan_012109.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/Economic_Stimulu...</a>).<p>Now, I'm not saying one or the other is correct (I know enough to know I don't have the tools to judge), but you say this as a statement of fact when it's not a settled question at all.<p>> Government spending involves special interests (spending that benefits a small amount of people at the expense of everyone) and incurs some wasteful spending. Example: John Murtha airport <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/23/murtha.airport/index..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/23/murtha.airport/index....</a>.<p>Yes, and so do tax cuts. In the US, we have a menagerie of various taxes and exceptions and brackets, etc., and it's very easy to tweak it to benefit special interests, like we have many times in the past. That doesn't invalidate the idea of passing tax cuts just like earmarks don't invalidate the idea of government spending.<p>> I thought the article was good in comparing a household (something everyone can compare to) to a government made up of the people. No household could ever keep up that deficit without forcefully taking money from someone else.<p>I'm not advocating for the deficit, but just because you like the analogy doesn't make correct.  Likening a household's budget to the United States' budget is like likening a photon to a race-car: any similarities there are are very shallow, and you're likely to come away with huge misconceptions.<p>This is actually precisely why I hate seeing economics articles on social news sites: it's a lot of propagation of (often wrong) ideas within a community of people with insufficient knowledge to be able to sort the good from the bad.<p>I really wish we'd just stick to what we're good at, rather than getting into the subject of macroeconomics and politics around here.",1257011523

913767,comment,913540,913540,0,0,robotrout,,,"I've just been pondering such a service, as the result of a friend of mine, being moved to an assisted living facility.  He has no email there, and wouldn't be able to use it if he did.  I would love to send him quick updates on my life and my kids, but, while I could spare him five minutes to dash off an email and attach some photos to it, the task of printing the photos on a color printer, finding his address, etc., usually gets the task procrastinated, sometimes for weeks, in that ""I'll do it tomorrow"" procrastination dance.<p>My thoughts on this line were as follows.<p>1) It needs to allow photos.  They can be an extra charge of course, but I would want to send photos.<p>2) There's a ton of paper handling equipment out there.  If you invested about $20K, maybe 10K if you bought used, I would think you could get a solution that was 100% automated.  It printed, stapled, folded, printed the envelope, and stuffed the contents.  A service with such an automated capability, that showed pictures of their equipment on their website so I knew it was real, would definitely be reassuring from a privacy standpoint, as well as a reliability standpoint.<p>3) As for API, my thought was to make the whole thing, just email.  Parse incoming emails to confirm the sender is an account holder.  Parse the email for the markup headers that you define to designate recipient address.  If they don't exist, fire off a reply email to the same address, telling them they messed up and didn't mark up their submission properly.  Done.  No visiting your website at all, after I set up my account.<p>3a) I would also suggest a way for me to assign frequently used snail mail addresses as part of an email address.  For example, say you assign me the email address QWERTY@mailservice.com.  Whenever I mail to that address, you know it's my account, and send the contents of the appropriately marked up email to the recipients.  OK, fine.  But now, allow me to assign sub-addresses.  So, for example, if I email QWERTY.terry@mailservice.com, and I've already defined the address of terry, now I don't have to mark up my email at all.  I just put QWERTY.terry@mailservice.com into my email address book, and my friend Terry is the same as contacting anybody else with email.  With such a system, mailing somebody and emailing somebody take exactly the same steps on my part.  In fact, I can even CC them on an email I send to somebody else.",1257010177

But war spending will always find a way. That's the nature of wars -- they are deemed more important than other things, including social programs.<p>Look at it this way -- increased debt load means an <i>increased</i> chance of war, as non-violent options are not available due to restricted amounts of money and the only way to access that money is through a national emergency. Please forgive the example, but I think its apt: the nazis, after all, were the nationlist socialist party, not the free enterprise gang. They took control over all industry and turned it into a war machine. This was based on a movement for better social justice, but it easily transformed into a monstrosity.

During the summer, I saw people riding those bikes around all the time, but I have no idea how popular the program is. You can also rent bikes at all the major train stations.",1257008772

The rest of the electronics are in the docking stations.<p>I'm thinking the $3500 price probably includes the docking station which is kinda misleading.",1257008687

Flash is currently most easily coded with AS3. Adobe recently redid the flash VM to behave more like a traditional programming language and did away with most of the movie clip timeline stuff, so AS3 is more like just coding. Very nice UI API as well. Essential AS3 is a good book to learn. <a href=""http://www.smashingmagazine.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smashingmagazine.com</a> is a good reference for learning design itself.

It's got the same Cypress FX2 high-speed USB chip and Spartan3E FPGA as the Xylo from fpga4fun.com/knjn.com but it costs $129 instead of $299, comes with full schematics, and gives you lots of switches, LEDs, and ports to work with too.

Stack based forms are easy, you push the data onto the stack and pop it again when you need it, and the VM's compiler handles the heavy lifting.  With a register form, specifically where you have an infinite number of registers, you are effectively doing SSA in your compiler to map onto 'registers' (SSA variables) and writing out the raw intermediary form.

Limited sample size also severely restricts ability to claim significant correlation (which is implied in claiming predictive power).<p>Nobody is claiming that statistically rigorous data, which show that the women self-selecting for applications in this job post can't pass the qualifications, should not be made public; the claim is that claiming predictive power in a <i>sample of two</i> that hurts a negatively stereotyped group is irresponsible.

Suppose Joe User has configured Auctex on a squeaky-clean Emacs 23 installation. Joe had been trying to understand coherent sheaves and Serre duality, and so, having spent the morning reading ""Lectures on Riemann Surfaces"" by R.C. Gunning, he took some notes with paper and pencil. Then, he wrote a corresponding set of notes in his brand new Auctex system. It was all running and well, and Joe C-x C-s'd and went to bed and dreamt of Gammas and Pics and Strange Os. Joe woke up the next morning and went into zazen, looking at the sun rising through the treetops in the forest behind his home.<p>And he did it again that day, and made a bit more progress, and learned a beautiful proof for Weierstrass's theorem using the induced sheaf cohomology of the exponential sheaf sequence. Joe decided to use Windows XP -- he didn't want to think about all that lisp stuff today, and having nothing but Internet Explorer 6 (Joe only reads one page at a time) and Notepad to do his work with, he wrote the rest of his Latex notes in Notepad. And he felt happy, and went to bed -- which wasn't a bed, just a floor, as Joe was really a minimalist sort of guy.<p>==<p>How will Emacs enhance his experience (in any broad sense)? He doesn't compile often. Come to think of it, he probably doesn't need the preview-latex function either. In which forms do these gains come for him? Generally, what is the least complex form of editing that Emacs can still produce gains for?",1247623843

Instead of requiring Calc I, II, III, Linear Algebra, and three science courses like Physics I, II and Biology, this program requires only Calculus I and II for Life Sciences.  The B.A. is designed for students who want to double major in a non-science field, and are required to take four courses relating to computing/technology in that second major.  (As well, the student must take five Computer Science electives, like students pursuing B.S. degrees do.)<p>It's not difficult to do undergraduate research by doing an independent study with a professor for a grade, or by working for a professor for money during the school year (which is probably a bit harder than for credit).  One would probably be expected to have completed the introductory coursework (data structures, algorithms, discrete math), of course.  Yet another option is joining the honors program and writing an honors thesis, which could tie into the undergraduate research you could do.<p>In the summer, there is an official REU program with a stipend and housing.  On top of that, professors also frequently have funds to pay skilled/upperclassmen undergraduates for conducting research, similar to what happens during the school year.",1275853983

1409005,comment,1408505,1408866,0,0,jacobian,,,"Wow, you could teach a class on rhetorical fallacies from your comment alone. Let's try to unpack it here.<p>First, you've tried to claim access journalism as part of accepted journalistic ethics. In fact, access journalism is <i>not</i> part of any accepted journalistic ethic, and is in fact the subject of great consternation among journalists themselves.<p>Second, you've implied that I'm somehow proud of the practice of access journalism. Once again, the fact is that I, like you, find the practice repugnant.<p>Third, you've tried to use this supposed anti-ethic to thus dismiss the entire ethical foundation of journalism via some sort of guilt by association. Of course, even if some aspect of journalistic ethics were to be found suspect, that still wouldn't negate the rest of the practice. In fact, like all ethical pursuits, the whole is greater than the parts: journalists, like lawyers and doctors, bind themselves to ethical practice. There are always those willing to violate those ethics, but an access journalist no more discredits his entire profession than a negligent doctor.<p>Fourth, you've made a false appeal to common ground (""It's fine if Apple wants to retaliate"") which mischaracterizes my argument -- you'll note I didn't once mention ""Apple"" in my comment -- and sets up a false equivalency where Apple's behavior somehow excuses Gizmodo's. In fact, I think Apple's actions <i>are</i> clearly retaliatory, but that wasn't the argument I made, and is still unrelated to Gizmodo's unethical behavior.<p>Fifth, you've argued against the claim that Apple ""is defending the honor of all journalists."" That's indeed a specious claim, and one worth arguing against. Except that I didn't make it. In fact, you've again mischaracterized my argument which, for the record, was simply that Gizmodo needs to choose which side of the fence they sit on.<p>Finally, you've enclosed the word ""journalists"" in air quotes as a sort of argument-by-ridicule: you've tried to assert stylistically that journalism is something to scoff at, and thus that anyone -- like me -- who defends journalism is similarly subject to ridicule. In fact, journalism is generally accepted as being a requirement for democracy -- see, for example, the Bill of Rights.",1275853965

I knew this piece was kind of disorganized, but I didn't realize it was <i>that</i> bad.<p>So I'll try to summarize here, a bit.<p>Question: How compact can you make a full-featured interactive programming environment? And what techniques would you use to do so?<p>Methods: Quantitative comparison of some sample code written for 17 different virtual machines, quantitative analysis of the code in a Squeak image to see what operations need to be most compact, and an implementation of a simple dictionary.<p>Tentative answer: A stack-based bytecode with local variables and special bytecodes for common operations, like Squeak's, provides the best density for high-level code. Polymorphic method dispatch improves code density. You can implement the virtual machine for the Squeak-style bytecode more compactly in Forth-style threaded code than directly in machine code. So you should be able to get an entire working interactive interpreter for a flexible, convenient language into 2000 to 6000 bytes.<p>Does that help?<p>I'm sorry my logic appeared to be so ""lame"", but I think the fault is more in the comprehensibility of the article than in its logic.",1275853744

1408970,comment,1406981,1407411,0,0,kragen,,,"> Thinking about it, I have no clue how to represent a nested list on a stack. How would you represent ((1 2) (3 4))?<p>In PostScript, it looks like this:<p><pre><code>    GS>[[1 2] [3 4
    GS<5>pstack
    4
    3
    -mark-
    [1 2]
    -mark-
</code></pre>
The [ pushes a mark onto the stack, and ] allocates an array of the appropriate size, sticks stuff into the array from the stack, and leaves the array on the stack. (A pointer to it, if you want to get nitty-gritty.) Two more ]'s would pack the above up into a single nested array. Perl uses a similar strategy.<p>On the other hand, if you're representing (car '((1 2) (3 4))) in Lisp bytecode (e.g. elisp), it looks more like this:<p><pre><code>    pushconst 83258023
    car
</code></pre>
That's the approach my Ur-Scheme takes in machine code, too; I just posted the assembly it generates for that expression at <a href=""http://gist.github.com/427828"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/427828</a>. (Ur-Scheme is a very dumb, naïve compiler, like something you might write for an exercise in a compilers class, and it uses the x86 as a stack machine.)<p>Finally, if you are representing (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)) in stack bytecode, you end up with something like this:<p><pre><code>    pushconst 1
    pushconst 2
    pushconst #list
    call 2
    pushconst 3
    pushconst 4
    pushconst #list
    call 2
    pushconst #list
    call 2
</code></pre>
You can also use a PostScript-style stack mark instead of an argument count, and sometimes (e.g. commonly in Smalltalk) the function and argument count are all packed up in a single bytecode. If the argument count is implicit in the function (e.g. it's checked at compile-time) you don't need the argument count at all, but that doesn't allow you to write variadic functions like ""list"".",1275852827
1408969,story,,,9,4,DenisM,"Ask HN: expanding on MVC with frameworks for declarative UI description?",,"Having written a bunch of UI code for iPhone I am now tempted to design my own framework to factor out reusable parts. However, before I begin I would like to tap into collective wisdom of this community - surely someone has done similar work before and if so I would be glad to learn rather than reinvent.<p>Here's how I see the structure of a single ""page"" in an application, expanding on MVC:<p>1. The Model - a software component and backing storage which provide access to the data. The important thing here is that Model itself must represent data how it's structured in the user's head, not how it's really stored in e.g. a relational database.<p>2. The Model Schema - a declarative description of types,  relationships, and arity of the data entities stored in the Model. Model Schema could be an XML file, for example.<p>3. Text (Copy), possibly localized. A simple key-value text file would likely suffice.<p>4. Layout description - list of UI controls and their design attributes (colors, fonts, margins, alignment, grouping/proximity etc). This also includes binding from controls to the Model Schema and to Copy. Layout description also can be a declarative description, such as an XML file.<p>To make this whole thing come alive I would need a layout engine that can take layout description, create UI controls, populate them with data according to bindings and place them on screen according to design attributes, taking content into account. The difficult part is handling arity.<p>If I can pull this off, I can see enormous benefit: a designer, a developer, and a copy writer could be iterating independently based on a single common document - the Model Schema - and seeing the complete animated result of their work as they make progress.<p>So what are the closest things to this that someone else has already done or tried to do?<p>Note that existing iPhone UIKit cannot do content-sensitive layout, all layout positioning is independent of content and so often looks poor with truncated text or large areas of whitespace - this deficiency and the countless hours spent aligning text on screen were the primary motivators behind my thinking.",1275852780

For example, let&#x27;s assume that it&#x27;s possible to set up an experiment to determine whether the moral value that says &quot;we should use honor killing&quot; leads to more harm than good.<p>The question is, how do we know that we should do the experiment?  How can science provide us with the moral value that says &quot;we should do science&quot;?  How do we know scientifically, absolutely, that more knowledge is good for the well-being of humanity?

But the service will monetize very well. For example I would pay extra per album to get to stream a couple albums on the day of their CD release just because it&#x27;s convenient to have all my music in one application.  \nOr charge me 15$ a month for a gold account and add a feature on the artist page to leave a 1$ tip.

6044231,comment,6043945,6043945,2,0,gamble,,,"The streaming-music business reminds me of Netflix in its early days, before movie studios became worried that it was cannibalizing rental/VOD revenue for new releases. There are a certain group of fans who are willing to pay $10-20 per album for access to music the moment it&#x27;s released. With Spotify, those fans are treated like any other stream even though they&#x27;re willing to pay more. It&#x27;s inefficient pricing, except from Spotify&#x27;s perspective as they&#x27;re able to use immediate access to new release music as a lure for subscribers. So really, you can look at Spotify as capturing that demand and converting it into free advertising for themselves. I don&#x27;t see that as sustainable in the long run. Some artists are already holding back new releases from streaming services. Like Netflix, I think that in the future you will see few new releases from popular artists until they&#x27;ve been available through premium services long enough to capture demand from hardcore fans.<p>Spotify treats all songs as if they have equal value, but that&#x27;s obviously not true from the listener&#x27;s perspective. For any given person, there are going to be some songs that they&#x27;re willing to pay a premium to hear, and some that they&#x27;ll only listen to if it&#x27;s free. Spotify is a good deal for the latter case, but not if it offers a discounted version of the former to people who could pay for it. Just because Spotify counts every stream as a single interchangeable unit of value doesn&#x27;t mean that listeners value every stream equally.",1373874557

There are already many algorithms to determine the activity an user is currently performing (such as walking, jogging, biking, sitting, etc). Often these methods take windows of time (1-2 seconds) and compare characteristics with learned models. This way the time series data is clustered/classified into models. An additional result from this is an (implicit) segmentation of the time series arises.<p>My theory is that when the segmentation of the time series is first performed explicitly, the (bigger) chucks of data can be better characterized. So my goal is to find the change points in the time series; and a change points means that the underlying process (being the user carrying the phone) has changed (e.g. from walking to running).<p>I want to detect the change point using novelty-detection techniques; so roughly speaking: when a certain number of data points are considered &quot;new&quot;/&quot;outlier&quot;, I assume there is a change in the signal and report that moment of time. Then the model adapts to the new distribution of data and watches again for a change point.",1373874088

It&#x27;s saving me probably 100-200/year and that&#x27;s being conservative. That means it&#x27;s costing artists that much * users.<p>Why don&#x27;t more artists take the Jay-Z approach? Build an app for your album, make people buy it, or sell it in bulk to a big brand like Samsung. This seems like a way for artists to take back the industry. Pirating music from a Jay-Z app seems much much harder than from a desktop. I think we&#x27;re on the verge of a total shift back to the world of pre-CD burners where you simply had to pay 10-20 to listen to an album.<p>What am I missing?",1373873772

The feeling of control and having essentially <i>everything</i> the way I want is seductive and easy to miss when I work with Windows or any other Linux.

This year I swapped out my nVidia GTX260 for a Radeon HD 7950, so of course X wouldn&#x27;t start.

It&#x27;s a much better experience for finding out what packages are available or a description of a package.<p>Another feature I like about Gentoo is &#x27;rolling releases&#x27;.

2085400,comment,2084732,2085138,0,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>the times when it gets out of my way to let me think about the problem and then everything else seems clearer.</i><p>There are two different ways languages accomplish this.<p>Smalltalk and Lisp accomplish this through odd-looking minimal syntaxes.  The code may not look like anything familiar (outside of longish intention-revealing names) but there are so few syntactic rules to process that a smart person should be able to master them in a few days or weeks at most.  (Despite the lack of familiar operator precedence for arithmetic operations.)<p>Python and Ruby accomplish this by having moderate amounts of syntax.  (Ruby has about 3X more syntax than Python, but you can ignore much of Ruby syntax for general purpose programming and leave it in the ""sysadmin toolshed."")  However, the moderate amounts of syntax are designed to closely resemble pseudocode your professor used to scrawl on the chalkboard.  Hence, the language can stay out of the way while you focus on the problem domain.<p>On the other end of the spectrum are languages that expose everything.  C, C++, and Assembly are like this.  Everything is available in raw form or as powerful and arcane tools.  The beginner might be a little lost, but the rewards to the virtuoso are tremendous.<p>This is an oversimplification, of course.  Python and Ruby also give the power-programmer access to powerful, arcane, and easily-abused tools.  It's also quite possible to write very clean pseudocode-resembling code in C or C++.  (See the Taligent coding standards.)  The difference is really only in design-focus of the languages.  (Smalltalk as another example.  Smalltalk was designed to be simple to the complete novice -- as in a grade school aged kid.  This is why it's minimalist, yet manages to look odd to the hard-core Unix geek.)",1294577485

It's pretty obvious that the Ion design is inspired by the DIY book scanner builders out there (DIYBookScanner, BKRPR).<p>I hope they do a good job of it. Honestly, I'll be shocked if they meet their claimed $149 price point and have quality beyond webcam-capture. If they do, it will be an awesome device, so I hope they do. Also, right now, they claim 7 seconds for two pages, which is a damned eternity.<p>If anyone has any pet projects that they need motivation or advice to do, we've got a really active community of book scanners, hackers, and builders developing new technology daily. If it involves a camera and a book, we've probably tried it and the locals are quite friendly.",1294577355

We want to create an app that let you ""Have fun with your friends, everywhere you go!"". \nThe app will let you and your friends play and having fun with fun facts, jokes, fast parlor games, funny challenges (shot a photo with a waitress), and so on.<p>An app works that way:\n- Open the app \n- Search the nearby venue where you're in (integration with Foursquare) and click on it\n- You click ""Challange-In"" to start play on that venue\n-You start playing that proposed games, or tell to your friends funny jokes, or try to do challenges, show a Demotivational image, or see together a funny spot\n-For each jokes (about 5 for each challange-in) you earn point to reach the top.\n-The last step is a slot machine where you can win (more earned point means more chances to win) a cool badge or a free beer (if you're in a pub). You can win discount or free stuffs, depending into the kind of venues you're in.<p>The app is free.\nIn every venue you Challenge-In, load different challenges, and you can win virtual or real prizes.<p>The idea is similar to SCVNGR but not to play alone, this app is to play with your friends!\nThen you have a ""medal showcase"" of the ""Frank's company"" or the ""Luke's company"". \nIn each venue, where people have challenged-in, there will be ranking of the company with more points earned. The company with more points, becomes the King of the Venue.\nIf your company is the first to Challenge-In into the venue, becomes the Little Lord of the Venue.<p>Will you use this app?

2085368,comment,2084732,2085212,0,0,newgame,,,"I concur with your points. These are some of the problems I had, too, coming from a python background. To add to your list: the # operator confuses a lot of people as can be seen on the mailing list (although its semantics are well-defined actually). Nevertheless there are also convincing reasons for these decisions. Have a look at e.g. <a href=""http://lua-users.org/wiki/LocalByDefault"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lua-users.org/wiki/LocalByDefault</a>. And the use of ""end"" certainly helps with anonymous functions.<p>Purely looking at the language resp. the consistency of the design I would even say that Lua is more beautiful than Python even though Lua has its share of warts. Note that this does not say anything about which language is easier to use in practice (which is Python imho).<p>But that aside, I think it is important to mention that comparing Lua and Python is a bit like comparing apples to oranges as they pursue <i>different</i> philosophies. Lua gives you just as much as you need but no more. This is the reason why it is so flexible and suited for embedding. Python, on the other hand, is a full blown general purpose programming language with a huge community/ecosystem.",1294575415

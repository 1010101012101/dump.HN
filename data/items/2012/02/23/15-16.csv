Anyways, I am sure that not all PC Gamers have a Steam account.<p>As for creating a new account to gift someone something, I have taken your comment under consideration and am trying to incorporate Facebook login, so that we can at least try to lessen the effort needed to send someone a gift.<p>We differ to Amazon Wish List in the sense that with our service a person can choose a gift from among thousands of products Amazon offers, and not be restricted to a few items a person chooses to add to his wish list. Also another difference is that,  with GiftsBuffer the person receiving the gift will not know who has sent the gift either.

The company reminds me a good bit of the DeLorean Motor Company in that it will make an impact but will not be another Ford, because they have a marketing problem. Most think of early automobile companies as having products that sold themselves, since they competed against horses. This is just not true. What Ford did well was not just production- it was marketing. They could have had interchangeable parts up the yin-yang, but without the advertisements, the word of mouth, the product placement in movies, etc. they wouldn't be where they are today. So, let's assume that Tesla has a great product, which I can't say because I've never seen, driven, or ridden in one in-person. They need to mass market it. Even if everyone can't afford one, they need to want to own one. I don't, because they haven't made it sexy! If they mass market it, they will get the revenue they need to attract the investment to really start the product cycle seriously.

3625194,comment,3622674,3624864,4,0,drostie,,,"There are about 252 trillion or 2^48 passwords consisting of 8 symbols drawn from (uppercase/lowercase letters + numbers + space). These are presently available in a downloadable lookup table which uses a compression method called 'rainbow tables' to store this information in just 350 GB, if I am reading these numbers correctly. There are similar lookup tables which include all 32 symbols accessible from the keyboard out to 7 characters, taking up 130 GB on disk. These speedups and compressions are made by large distributed computing projects, and would otherwise be out of the range of normal consumers -- but now that the lookup table has been generated, it can be pretty quickly queried, as I understand it.<p>Salting a hash is meant to stop precisely these attacks, and these numbers were taken for MD5 in particular from:<p><pre><code>    http://tbhost.eu/rt.php?algorithm=2\n</code></pre>\nHowever this also gives us a bound on what's possible. A large project with 10,000 users trying to brute-force passwords can brute force all 2^48 of these, and store them in a highly compressed fashion, in however long it takes to make these things (months?). In theory, no password with under 48 bits of entropy is truly safe from someone with access to, say, government-scale computation.<p>What's possible for the rest of us? I can use Node.js to encrypt a typical password using PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA1) like so:<p><pre><code>     crypto.pbkdf2('sconesMultiply51', '0SGrf8KIZ', Math.pow(2, 17), 18, logger)\n</code></pre>\nThis takes 377 ms on my web server and calls SHA1 something like 2^18 times (twice for HMAC, 2^17 for the PBKDF parameter above), 255ms on my laptop. It's also a wrapper for an OpenSSL routine. So this should be about typical for C routines, and I should be able to do 2^20/s without GPU speedups. (That's 2^36 passwords/day.)<p>The above password 'sconesMultiply51' only has 40 bits of unpredictableness, so give me about two weeks, '0SGrf8KIZ', and sha1('0SGrf8KIZsconesMultiply51') and I can quite possibly find 'sconesMultiply51' by brute force on a laptop.<p>GPUs make things faster. This site:<p><pre><code>    http://www.insidepro.com/eng/egb.shtml\n</code></pre>\nreports doing sha1($pass.$salt) 80 million times per second on an older GPU (an nVidia GTS250). So they can get 2^26/s. If they're right, then they could hypothetically find 'sconesMultiply51' in under a day, as long as you reconfigured them to start searching words from a 10,000-word dictionary which might optionally be capitalized, rather than individual characters.<p>What's the absolute upper bound? Well, thankfully, the biggest public supercomputers are actually very well-known and published on top500.org. The absolute top of the line today is this beast:<p><pre><code>    http://i.top500.org/system/177232\n</code></pre>\nIt does 2^53 floating point operations per second. Assuming a hash is something like 100 or 1000 operations, you'd still have 2^43-2^46 tries per second. That's probably an upper limit on what your typical government can do, as well.<p>Lessons: (1) you'll be safe for the next 20 years at least if you just get used to<p><pre><code>    head -c 9 /dev/urandom | base64 | sed 's/+/_/g;s/\//-/g'\n</code></pre>\nand the 12-character passwords that result.

The Davy Crockett weapon, on the other hand, was small enough to be transported in a single jeep and fired by one person.<p>Additionally, since it was designed as a tactical weapon of war, the quarter-mile lethal radiation dose is what really matters. I believe this was particularly important for tanks, which are robust against nearby explosions but whose armor provides only poor shielding against radiation, meaning that you'd likely end up killing the crew even though the tank itself would still be mostly intact.<p>The fact that you could set these up ahead of time and have them manned around the clock would have made them an incredibly effective defense in Europe in the event of war with the USSR. Over two thousand were produced, and many positioned around the countryside. Delivering the equivalent in conventional explosives would have required hundreds or thousands of aircraft, vulnerable to getting shot down, and needing much more advance notice and planning, while making those aircraft unavailable for other uses.<p>I'm not saying that deploying a couple thousand man-portable nukes around the border areas of West Germany was necessarily a good idea, but it did make sense given the situation at the time.",1330010077

A memory-mapped dataset will cause pathological performance only when there is thrashing: If you are accessing a small percentage of the entire dataset, then unused data will be paged out and remain paged out. If the bulk of data being accessed exceeds the amount of available physical RAM, then you will get I/O trashing.<p>Memory-mapping is a good alternative to static allocation or a home-grown paging system because it lets the kernel handle the dynamics of allocation, letting your application transparently and gracefully handle RAM tension situation by relinquishing memory space to other apps. Kernels (including Linux and Windows) and CPUs are extremely efficient at paging I/O, much more efficient than a hand-written paging system because there's no need for the application's code to check whether a page is in physical memory  that's handled by the CPU itself.<p>Of course, any I/O incurred by a too-large dataset will drastically reduce performance compared to in-memory speed.

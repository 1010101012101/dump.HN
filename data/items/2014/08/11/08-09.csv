The result is sex-selective abortion and an underinvestment in girls so common it has popularized a Hindi motto: “beti to bojh hoti hai,” meaning, “a daughter is a burden.”<p>This explanation has always been unsatisfying for me. At least it seems incomplete. The system is obviously unethical, but I don&#x27;t understand how the economics work here.<p>If only the eldest son inherits, why are the the following sons valued?

We&#x27;re in a very weird period of time computer security wise. There was the first golden age, when computers weren&#x27;t easily connected and harmful software was generally not very impactful. Then there was a brief dark age when computers became connected and the utter lack of concern for security was revealed to be hugely exploitable on an unprecedented scale with an enormous impact. A lot of the worst mistakes were corrected and a lot of the most important software was tightened up, leading to a long &quot;security cold war&quot; lasting from roughly the late &#x27;90s or early 2000s to today. Right now we&#x27;re sort of in a cuban missile crisis period in the cold war, or something similar, the impact of computer security holes could result in events (of several possible kinds) which might have as much global economic and geopolitical impact as a major war. Whether that happens or not is as yet unknown, but the potential is there, and will remain there for likely quite sometime (several key vulnerabilities: core libraries such as openssl, essentially every major operating system, firmware on usb devices and storage devices in general, BGP, and SSL/TLS under the CA system).<p>I don&#x27;t think most tech companies and governments are taking the risks and threats seriously enough as of yet so I suspect some sort of calamity will have to happen first before things are truly tightened up well enough for anyone to be able to trust anything and not be deluding themselves in doing so.",1407746486

You&#x27;re referring to &quot;spinning reserve&quot; versus &quot;on-demand&quot; sources of power.<p>&quot;Spinning reserves&quot; are plants that we keep online in a &quot;ready&quot; state, but disconnected from the grid until we need them.  &quot;Spinning reserves&quot; are kept online in the case of a failure elsewhere on the grid, or to adapt to load changes throughout the day.  These plants are cost-effective for this use case.<p>&quot;On-demand&quot; facilities are plants that have very fast spin-up time, and so they can be brought &quot;online&quot; from a powered-off very quickly.  These kinds of plants are also cost-effective to cycle between both states.<p>Natural Gas Combustion Turbines happen to have fast startup time (fast=minutes), and are cost efficient to keep running, so they&#x27;re used on the grid for both &quot;on demand&quot; and &quot;spinning reserve applications&quot;, as it&#x27;s cheap to cycle them between both states and cheap to keep them spinning (as long as natural gas is cheap).  Even better &quot;on demand&quot; sources of power are batteries, since they can be flipped on/off the grid like a lightswitch, but I digress.<p>Nuclear power plants, on the other hand, are awful for &quot;on demand&quot; applications since they take many days, weeks or months to fully power on/power off, and it costs a lot of money to do so.

8162439,comment,8162149,8162149,2,0,sytelus,,,"There are several problems with author&#x27;s argument.<p>1. Future outcomes are not entirely determined by just past state + laws of physics. There is a very important component that author seems to be only eluding fleetingly: Randomness. So future = past + laws + randomness. Here laws are implicitly understood to be probabilistic that requires some randomness source.<p>2. An all important question now is this: What is the source of randomness in universe? I think if we can answer this question, we will likely have understood pretty much everything that is to be understood about the universe. A perfect random generator is theoretically required to store infinite amount of information. If universe is finite in the sense that (space X time) is finite then perfect true randomness is not possible. BTW, concept of true randomness is not some fuzzy thing. It&#x27;s very well defined mathematically (see Vol II by Knuth). Summary: Let&#x27;s say a random number generator produced a sequence of 0s and 1s. The perfectness of RNG can be measured by the distribution of every possible permutation of all length of 0s and 1s occurring in that sequence.<p>3. Let&#x27;s say universe has <i>some</i> master random number generator that sources randomness in to all its outcomes. Is it possible to add or subtract <i>randomness</i> from this generator? Can processes or particles within universe themselves be <i>source</i> of randomness? If so these particles or processes would meet the definition of free will. In other words, <i>free will</i> is nothing but random number generator itself because no one can predict or influence its behavior.<p>So in essence, our question becomes <i>can humans be source of randomness?</i>. As humans are made of same fundamental particles, it would imply, if humans have free will then particles must also have free will (i.e. Convey&#x27;s Free Will Theorem). The difference that humans make over fundamental particles is this: Humans can <i>filter</i> their free will by setting up complex set of computation on the top of it. So imagine normal particles simply generating random behavior while humans acting as some algorithm like hash function that sets up the computation on the top of their &quot;free will&quot; to generate probabilistically desired outcome. Obviously keyword here is <i>desired</i>. Are our desires simply deterministic or influenced by free will? Our desire to survive is obviously programmed by genes. However our desire to climb a mountain because <i>its there</i> or draw a painting is probably much more influenced by free will.",1407745459

Many European countries have statistics similar to that of the US (Sweden has a bit more, the UK a bit less, etc).<p>But I digress. The problem with the existing system is that it is insane and a waste of resources. One has to get a lawyer and wait for a long time with no certainty in the outcome while dealing with an extremely opaque bureaucracy where anything can go wrong at any time.<p>This has nothing at all to do with volume. Indeed, a simpler more streamlined and less opaque system would help with volume.<p>Say a system like the Canadian or the UK one. There&#x27;s a point scale. You can compute the number of points you get ahead of time, now there&#x27;s a simple web form actually. If you cross the threshold you will get in. There are known wait times, you can just call the embassy. There are points for things the country needs (particular jobs), for certain qualifications (degrees, etc), for language proficiency, some regional tweaks, family, and having an employment offer.<p>And extremely importantly. You get permanent resident status (green card), not an H1B. What Americans don&#x27;t realize is that you want to hand out green cards. H1B lower both your salaries and ours. The H1B restricts immigrant mobility, can&#x27;t move to a better job and raise the average salary, and encourages people to go home with all of their newly gained knowledge and money.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a personal example of the difference between a sane and an insane system:<p>As an 11 year old I filled out all of our Canadian immigration paperwork (my parents checked it but it was correct and they didn&#x27;t change it). We knew we would get in based on our points. The embassy told us the timeframe in which we should expect our paperwork to go through. It went through a bit early. We moved to Canada.<p>Now for the US. As a near-30-year old with a US PhD working at a top research institution I have to pay a specialized law firm several thousand dollars, spend weeks getting paperwork, bugging people in several countries to write absurd letters, building a case, etc. All of this to basically the same thing. And in the end, who knows what will happen because there are no standards, no appeal, no one to discuss anything with. Oh, and I have no idea what the processing time is.<p>So no. It is not an issue of &quot;why can&#x27;t they just let me in&quot;. It&#x27;s a system that hurts your salary by restricting my mobility, hurts me by making me pay lawyers needlessly, hurts the image of the US by creating disgruntled people, and hurts the economy by routing business and increasingly prestigious conferences elsewhere.

All use of fossil fuels and nuclear power is to be phased out. Notably, it suggests that hydroelectric power should be used to balance loads.  i.e. It proposes that California&#x27;s power grid be stabilized with only hydroelectric power as an on-demand source of generation.<p>Firstly, in 2013 California imported 32.7% of it&#x27;s electricity.  California has little control over how this is generated.  Of the power used by California, 40.8% is from Natural Gas, 8.1% is hydroelectric, 6.0% is Nuclear, 4.3% is from wind power, 4.2% is geothermal, 2.1% is from biomass, and 1.4% is solar[1].<p>Natural Gas and Nuclear power are both excellent on-demand sources of power, and currently meet 46.8% of California&#x27;s electricity requirements.  If these power sources are to be phased out, they must be replaced with energy sources that are on-demand.  Wind and solar do not fit this description.  Hydro does, but quintupling California&#x27;s hydroelectric capacity will have a huge impact on the environment.   This paper greatly underestimates how much on-demand power generation capacity a power grid needs in order to be stable.<p>Side note: California currently derives little of it&#x27;s electricity from wind or solar power.  Electric vehicle batteries carry a high environmental cost to produce, so it is imperative that the energy they are charged with be of renewable origin for any net environmental benefits to be reaped.  Given that 40.8% of California&#x27;s electricity currently comes from natural gas, it&#x27;s clear that anyone plugging their EV&#x27;s into California&#x27;s grid is doing the environment no favors.<p>[1]<a href=""http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/electricity/electricity_gen_1983-2013.xls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/electricity/electricity_gen_1983...</a>",1407744402

Now what?",,"While doing a bit of research for a blog article, I created a way to find thousands of new valid emails / passwords every day. The method I used and the scripts I wrote are actually very basic and common sense, and mostly rely on the fact that there is an easy way to find passwords that are poorly chosen. Now I am a bit torn about what to do. In a sense I would like to warn people (even though those warnings have already been said thousands of times) about this whole thing. But on another hand, putting out that information to the public would only be detrimental to all those people whose credentials would all of a sudden be out in the open for everyone to abuse. There is also the legal issue and I am in no way trying to get close to doing something stupid. Also this is not a case where I can issue a responsible disclosure as the information is found through 1/ weak passwords by random people, 2/ weak encryption by random organizations. Should I just let the whole thing go and concentrate on something else? Please advise. Thanks.",1407744159

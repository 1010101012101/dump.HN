Microsoft isn't going to run out of money anytime soon; it can buy itself quite a lot of time, enough for several chances.<p>Paul Graham also declared Microsoft dead (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html</a>) 3.5 years ago. With all reservations made to the meaning of the word ""dead"" in this fine essay, I can't find the way around some ways in which this is simply wrong. For example, if I want to play a computer game nowadays, I'd better have Windows. The vast majority of games, from indie and experimental through proud little independent companies all the way to established companies - are made for Windows. It's like the only game in town. There's no sign of changing this in sight. Granted, PC  game market is a fraction of that of consoles, but in consoles Microsoft established a good foothold too and not giving it up anytime soon.<p>I'm afraid that many technology observers drink too much of some fashionable kool-aid and over-dramatize things. Wherever some company or technology appears that has non-zero chance to potentially displace established company or technology X, they declare it ""X killer"" or proclaim X dead. I'm afraid I can't fully trust the expertise and reasoning of said people after that.<p>Maybe Microsoft's hopes to bury iPhone and Android are just that, hopes. But declaring it Microsoft's ""last chance"", even in mobile segment, is no less wishful thinking.",1286059583

1751515,comment,1749714,1749714,0,0,randyr,,,"Prediction on Higher Education (a couple of years from now):<p>Students no longer drive to class early in the morning.  Nor do students have to work around class schedules.  Instead, students view prerecorded lectures from their laptops/I-Phones.  Gone are the days of live teachers and live students.<p>These video lectures were recorded many years ago.  The university pays the original ""recorded"" professor a small royalty for each class.  This royalty fee costs a fraction of a live lecture.  This allows the university to pay for a top notch professor to lecture/record one semester, then reuse that recorded lecture in subsequent semesters.  One-time cost.<p>Student questions are posted to message boards which a professor actively monitors and responds to.  Students never ask the same question twice since all previous questions are searchable online.  Professor responsiveness is very quick (usually in 1-2 hours).  The professor answering questions is a full time professor (which may not be the same person as the original recorded professor).  This full-time professor is able to handle four times as many classes due to automation etc.<p>The need for college dorms is marginalized since they are no longer necessary.  Because of this, dormitories with excess capacity are demolished since their operating costs are fixed and become a resource drain if not filled to capacity.  OR, students get single rooms all to themselves!<p>Tuition prices plummet due to a surplus of pre-recorded lectures on the market.  New industries develop that specialize in creating top-notch video lectures for colleges and handling student questions on message boards (24/7 rapid response student support).  Local colleges contract with these new companies (again at significantly lower costs).<p>International students also benefit (lower tuition/more accessible classes etc).  The reach of the US education system now permeates every continent.  This has other benefits to their local economies with a higher skilled workforce.   Traveling to the US for one semester may be required (for lab classes which require a live teacher).<p>Tuition for all students is now affordable (and continues to drop as time goes on).  Student loans are minuscule.<p>In the end, higher education is commoditized.  Prices plummet, quality increases.",1286058431

You can't implement it any more than you can implement general relativity. It's a description of reality.<p>* The CAP theorem is not a data model which competes with or intersects at all with relational algebras. Rather, a relational algebra is the logical model (allegedly) underlying RDBMSes which are systems which historically provide consistency at the expense of availability in the presence of faults (thus obeying the CAP theorem because they're real systems and not opium dreams).<p>* Scaling horizontally does not imply anything about fault-tolerance. It instead describes systems in which resources can be incrementally added to incrementally gain capacity. It's possible to build a horizontally-scalable system which is less reliable than a single-machine system; it's also possible to build fantastically fault-tolerant systems which are also horizontally-scalable (c.f. Dynamo). Doing the latter is considered ""a good idea;"" doing the former is considering ""fucking daft.""<p>* Nothing about horizontally-scalable systems (or NoSQL or really anything the author mentions except for Redis) requires that the entire dataset be kept in memory. Systems like Riak (<a href=""http://riak.basho.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://riak.basho.com</a>) or Voldemort (<a href=""http://project-voldemort.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://project-voldemort.com/</a>) use pluggable storage engines, some of which (e.g. InnoStore and BDB-JE) have excellent performance with 1:10 RAM-to-dataset ratios. By the author's own metric, the Holy Grail has not only been found but the damn things are multiplying.<p>* Neither epoll nor kqueue ""scale indefinitely in terms of I/O concurrency."" Nothing does. That's horseshit.<p>You're better off huffing glue than reading this thing. I don't even care what he has to say about Redis. He could have some incredible insights about it, but they'd be completely and totally negated by the incomprehension, misinformation, untruths, and general crazytalk which preceded it.<p>tl;dr: 15+ years of RDBMS experience gives you 0 clues about distributed computing; reading Time Cube (<a href=""http://www.timecube.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timecube.com/</a>) is preferable to reading this drek.",1286057689

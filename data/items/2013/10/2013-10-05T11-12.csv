6500408,comment,6500107,6500333,1,0,chrismonsanto,,,"> Could you elaborate on the scammers?<p>Here&#x27;s an example. I remember there being a big storm, so big that the subways were shutting down temporarily, and if you didn&#x27;t catch a ride soon you would be stuck for a bit. Of course this announcement was in Japanese, and I didn&#x27;t understand the exact words, but I did figure it out from the rain + watching other folks scramble to buy tickets.<p>There was a guy there who would go up to the tourists and let them know there was a storm coming and that they needed to buy their tickets. He would say this very hurriedly, causing the tourists to become a bit panicked. Then it was
&quot;Where do you live?&quot; &quot;Ah, you should take this route&quot; &quot;Do you have enough for this? How much money do you have?&quot; and at this point the tourists would instinctively pull their yen out of their pockets. Then the guy would clasp their hands over the tourists, lead their hands to the machine, and dump the coins in the machine. The machine would spit out a ticket, he would hand it to them, and then say &quot;oh and I&#x27;ll take this for helping you&quot; and run off (revealing that he took some of your yen while he was guiding your hands to the machine).<p>He was actually pretty slick about it, and I imagine it worked on most people because they were accustomed to the locals being very polite. And by reinforcing that he was helping you, I think he avoided people reporting him. I ended up running into him again doing the same thing at a different subway station, so I assume he changed locations often.",1380973999

I understand that I have no credit history in Japan, but can&#x27;t they at least give me a crappy ~$500 limit card to start with or something? I&#x27;ve applied to probably 10-15 cards and have been rejected every time.<p>My theory on why a lot of these things happen is that the companies or establishments have been burned by foreigners too many times in the past. For example, SoftBank does a background check when you try to open a cell phone plan with them. They don&#x27;t tell you what they&#x27;re checking, but if you fail the check, you have to pay for the phone up front instead of paying monthly. I&#x27;m guessing a lot of people came here for half a year or a year, opened up the contract, then left the country without paying.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard that getting an apartment is quite tough as well, but I had no trouble going through an agent and I got my first choice. You have to pay an exorbitant amount of money to move in (guarantor fee, key money, first month&#x27;s rent, agency fee) but that&#x27;s not really a foreigner-only thing. If I had known someone in Japan who would have been willing to pay my last month&#x27;s rent if I flew back home without mentioning anything, then I wouldn&#x27;t have needed the guarantor service.",1380973056

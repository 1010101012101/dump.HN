2573646,comment,2573364,2573521,1,0,mjb,,,"> None of those ""obscurity"" measures do anything meaningful to improve your security<p>That's just not true. Consider a practical analogy: the access ID badges that many companies issue to their employees. Most of the time, these badges do not include information identifying the company other than a simple postal address. This isn't a strong security mechanism by a long shot, but does serve to make it more difficult to use a lost card. Often, more difficult is all it takes to make a casual attacker lose interest in the target.<p>Hiding version information is a lot like that. Which is more useful to an attacker: ""ApacheTomcat 6.0.25"" or ""BigCompanyServer""? Sure, a sophisticated and dedicated attacker could identify the software you are running (often down to a version number), but that takes time. The time that takes is time taken away from the rest of the attack, and possibly enough of a timesink to deter some attackers.<p>I don't think anybody sensible is claiming that ""hide your server version"" is as important as ""don't run a known-buggy version"", but there is no doubt that both of these things have value.",1306083598

If you start twiddling with relationships between tags, I can imagine how many paths previously stored in software will get broken.<p>I can also imagine 'identity problems'. Not counting symlinks and hardlinks, the full file path serves as its URI. How can I be sure if /photos/europe/DSCN0001.JPG and /photos/london/DSCN0001.JPG are the same files?

Obviously I'm not planning on using this for / or anything system-related, but for my media archives &c it's perfect.  Taking movies for example, I've found most people I know think an alphabetical approach is the way to go.  This is useless, however, if I don't know what I want to watch.  With the tags I can easily take tag in genres, directors, actors, etc and have my filesystem help me choose a film.<p>There is on major thing that I've considered would be an awesome addition to a system like this: automatic tagging from the metadata.  It'd be awesome if my movies automatically got tagged by, say, resolution and length, so I wouldn't have to bother with such things.",1306083419

It's very interesting working on both sides of the equation; both have their challenges. While I'm still keeping the idea close to my chest, it's an untapped market which could potentially be very big.<p>I think there are plenty of opportunities on the desktop-side of things; millions of computers are sold every month. While we may be entering the long-tail of dedicated computer sales, being replaced by iPads and other specialized devices eventually, it's going to take a while for that switch to fully happen. At least 5 if not 10 years or more; the keyboard/mouse interface still rules for content creation, and many people spend their days sitting in front of one.<p>However, it's becoming very difficult to release a desktop-only application without some sort of web component. Everything from note taking software, to video games, to music software, is all expected to be connected online somehow.<p>I'd imagine a sticking point for some corporate software is security. Most companies are not comfortable having their data stored on someone else's servers, potentially unencrypted. Some even have special agreements with governments and businesses preventing them from doing so. A lot of these companies are being left out of the cloud.<p>Two possible solutions include providing server software for IT departments to deploy (been there, done that, it's not pretty or cheap), or to have some sort of encrypted solution syncing to the cloud. The trick is, data must be fully and securely encrypted ""before"" going to the cloud. If someone breaks into the cloud provider's storage, or intercepts the data in-transit, they must get gibberish. The cloud provider can't read the data either; only the business. Just an idea to think about. :)",1306081153

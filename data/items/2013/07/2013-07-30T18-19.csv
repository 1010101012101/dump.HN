6129224,comment,6127895,6128875,3,0,Torrents,,,"Very well said, thank you for the response. It&#x27;s disheartening to read people act like the prospect of a future in federal prison (over a &quot;crime&quot; where no one was hurt! And where the &quot;victims&quot; (JSTOR) don&#x27;t even want prosecution!) is a negligible factor in pushing someone into suicide.<p>Arguably life in our modern prison system is one of the most horrific experiences you can have, some of the most miserable living conditions on the planet. The effect on your psyche of having a group of highly empowered, well funded government agents seeking <i>zealously</i> to place you in that cage over what is really a silly reason cannot be overestimated.<p>Yes it&#x27;s tragic that Aaron committed suicide. But the real tragedy is that we as a people let our government cage non-violent offenders in a veritable hell all the time for stupid stupid reasons. It&#x27;s an atrocity that it happens, and for MIT to take a position of neutrality on whether or not a human should be caged up for downloading documents is at the <i>very least</i> condoning that atrocity.",1375210764

6129216,comment,6124078,6125011,1,0,alan-crowe,,,"The cap is about as low as it could be. The investors put up capital which is committed to the ordinary operation of the business. Buy some materials, hire some workmen, make some stuff. Perhaps none of it sells even at 90% off. The capital is gone. BUT the investors were never on the hook for any extra.<p>One could imagine company law creating a same-again limitation on liability. If you invest a million dollars, you have two reasons to watch the management you appoint, first they could lose your investment. Second if they screw up and do a lot of damage the investors are on the hook for the same again; potentially another million dollars.<p>It is quite a tricky proposal to analyze. Consider the common practice of supplying goods on 30 days credit. It is slightly risky. The purchaser might go bust without paying. Under current once-only limitation of liability it is common for suppliers to lose out, which can cause a ripple effect as one company goes bust, causes its suppliers to fail causing their suppliers to fail...<p>Under same-again limited liability the ripples go in a different direction as investors liquidate assets to meet &quot;second&quot; liabilities.",1375210737

If they had called off an overzealous D.A. from throwing the book at him, he might be alive today. Why not blame the D.A.? Or JSTOR? In any case, aiding in prosecution did not cause his death directly.<p>The decision to commit suicide was ultimately his own. Of all the options he had available to him, he consciously chose that option. I&#x27;m reminded of a quote by Viktor Frankl:<p><i>&quot;Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.&quot;</i><p>Aaron had the power to choose right until his last choice. Why do some people survive terrible hardships, and others don&#x27;t?<p>According to his close friends&#x27; personal accounts, Aaron suffered from suicidal thoughts and depression for many years. Long before the JSTOR case, and long before MIT ever got involved. As long as we&#x27;re speculating about things we can&#x27;t know for sure, I&#x27;m guessing depression was really to blame for his suicide.

Nice!!<p>This comes as a (personal) advise to all my fellow startups here.<p>Dear dudes and dudettes,<p>I&#x27;ve been a long and hard fan of the &#x27;Get shit done&#x27; mentality and I still am. From my past experience running Rails and Scala, I&#x27;m going to tell you what exactly you should do for your startup:<p>1) If you KNOW FOR SURE your startup will face a lot of page views, requests etc. before hand (Example - Real estate portals like Airbnb, Trulia, etc), then you should not make the serious mistake of ignoring high performance frameworks beforehand. This could literally be anything, but the alternative I <i>personally</i> recommend is something Scala based [Read section 4 for WHY].<p>2) As usual, use Rails (or django/similar) ALWAYS to build your v1 prototype. I say always because you will be incredibly surprised to see how much rails gets stuff done for you. While this is a huge advantage initially, this can also become a nightmare, later. Hence, I suggest you use rails only initially and not forever.<p>When you build your app with rails initially, you&#x27;re overcoming the most irritating pain point (or I&#x27;m just too lazy) - Building the database. Building the database with the required fields manually can be tiresome, if not slightly dangerous (assuming you are inexperienced). So, I suggest you install devise:<p><pre><code>    gem install devise
</code></pre>
And implement authentication through it. Why? Because Rails+Devise will create some useful columns for you <i>auto-magically</i> - created_at, updated_at, sign_in_count, etc. (to name a few).<p>3) Now, you NEED to understand what&#x27;s happening underneath devise as this is one of the core portions of your app. For this I suggest this rails cast:<p><a href=""http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scrat...</a><p>Now that you understand how the most important part of your app works, you should start to build a clone of your v1 on your desired high-performance framework of choice. I use Scala personally (and I would recommend you too).<p>4) So, Why Scala?<p>#Scala has a decent minimal syntax compared to Java, PHP and the rest.<p><pre><code>    Scala:
    def test = {&quot;hello world&quot;}
    
    PHP:
    <?php echo &quot;hello world; ?>

    Java:
    class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
    }
    }
    </code></pre>
# Generally, on an average, 1 line of Scala = 10 lines of Java. That&#x27;s less maintainable LOC (it can be argued otherwise, but just assume it&#x27;s a good thing)<p># Performance. Now this is where Scala really shines. Scala&#x27;s base performance is almost near Java&#x27;s in most real world scenarios. You get the benefit of Java without actually using it. How fast is Scala in contrast to Ruby? Well:<p>1 JVM = 10 thins (&quot;Rails is meant for a toy blog engine&quot; - Soundcloud)<p>Source:

<a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r5</a><p>#Inter-operability with JAVA. This is a HUGE plus. While everyone loves to bash Java, you should not forget that it&#x27;s a tried and battle-tested enterprise backed language. It&#x27;s horrible (arguable), but reliable. So, this means, you can use that high performance image-processing function written in Java you always wanted by calling it from within your scala code NORMALLY. Now that&#x27;s why I prefer Scala over newer languages like Go (It&#x27;s really good, but the library support is still growing). Don&#x27;t under-estimate this use case. Some secure functions used for authentication are available on various implementations on the Java land, compared to Go, etc.<p>---------<p>5) So if you use Scala, there&#x27;s a lot of alternatives for frameworks out there. The most popular ones are Play, Lift and Scalatra.<p>Play - Claims to be Rails like, but not even close to it. You need to work out everything on your own.  Some stuff is still buggy and some are still scary (implementation of security functions). Stateless.<p>Scalatra - Sinatra for scala. Minimal, super-fast, awesome. (I personally recommend this). Stateless.<p>Lift - Tried and battle tested, used in production by so many popular guys (Foursquare for example). HUGE learning curve and too heavy for a framework. A hell lot of stuff is done automatically for my taste (like generating it&#x27;s own login boxes with forgot password links, for example).<p>Performance comparison of all three frameworks here:<p><a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r5</a><p>Note: Scalatra is the fastest (for most use cases) of them all.<p>6) Now, write a clone of your app in your framework of choice. Use the v1 Rails prototype initially to get your investors, clients, etc. But, by v2, ship out the code on Scala. This means,<p>#Reduced costs (1 app server vs 10 app servers)<p>#More time to focus on business activities and a LOT more time before you need to start worry about scaling (the framework)<p>Pls note: The above point isn&#x27;t true if your app is db constrained.<p>Database suggestions:<p>Please ignore the noSQL hype. noSQL is DAMN GOOD for prototypes (use it for your v1) and for specific production use-cases. 99% of the use cases are covered by SQL. And the noSQL hipsters have created a terrible image for SQL databases that they don&#x27;t scale, etc. But it simply isn&#x27;t really true. Even something as basic as MYSQL scales pretty well. As documented by Quora&#x27;s founder here:<p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/Quora-Infrastructure/Why-does-Quora-use-MySQL-as-the-data-store-instead-of-NoSQLs-such-as-Cassandra-MongoDB-or-CouchDB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Quora-Infrastructure/Why-does-Quora-use...</a><p>Also, noSQL isn&#x27;t a golden solution:
<a href=""http://blog.engineering.kiip.me/post/20988881092/a-year-with-mongodb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.engineering.kiip.me/post/20988881092/a-year-with...</a><p>Some popular questions:<p>1) Scala engineers are difficult to find and hire<p>This is partially (in)correct. If you face issues with your Scala code OR if your scala code is the bottleneck (highly unlikely), then you can always hire a good Java developer and have that particular function/code module re-written in JAVA. Java developers aren&#x27;t difficult to find. Also, If you made the transition from Ruby to Scala, so can anybody else.<p>2) The productivity gain vs Performance gain<p>If you write your app in rails, you get a lot of productivity benefits, at the cost of performance. If you write your code in Scala, you lose your productivity at the gain of extra performance. So which one should you choose?<p>There is no doubt that Rails scales really well. But, out of the box, it is slow. Imagine it this way:<p>There are two ways to make a sculpture - Using plastic (Rails) and using metal (Scala/Go/etc). Sculpting a metallic structure is hard (ignore molding techniques). Sculpting plastic is easy.<p>But if you stress the plastic sculpture, it simply breaks out. There are lots of commercially available metallic coatings for your plastic sculpture that will promise you of no breakage etc. (SOA, Scalable PaaS like Heroku, etc.)<p>But they are expensive, and they don&#x27;t eliminate your pain points as promised. At some point you or an engineer is going to worry about the code. Better be it you and now than someone else, later.<p>It is important you understand what goes under a framework&#x27;s Magic (like authentication, database calls, etc) than just blindly believe it to be magic. This will not only make you a better developer, it will also help you from being taken advantage of by your outsourced companies or your engineers.<p>--------<p>I just poured out everything from a personal stand point. Frameworks are a matter of personal choice - You choose whatever that resonates with your philosophy. So, at the end of the day, be sure to go with whatever makes you happy (and confident).<p>All the best.",1375209841
6129106,comment,6127049,6128483,4,0,VLM,,,"I also read &quot;the mustache guy&quot; blog and a perspective that might help you understand him better is he&#x27;s all about controlling the location of his personal poverty line, not convincing himself that living at some supposedly universal poverty line is cool.  By working the system and thinking really hard (well, by median american standards) his personal poverty line is probably a quarter of mine.  That&#x27;s how both of us live pretty well, despite him getting only about 1/4 what I do.  He travels around the world about as much as I do, we both have similar goal of eating high quality food.<p>The other thing he&#x27;s really hot for is self control.  He spends like a drunken sailor; its just he only spends like a drunken sailor on things that are worth spending like a drunken sailor on.  There&#x27;s a lot of insight in the old unsourced W C Fields quote &quot;I spent half my money on gambling, alcohol, and wild women. The other half I wasted.&quot;  Ice cream just shows up on the &quot;wasted&quot; list.<p>The saga of the ice cream is a perfect example of sophistry as an attack mode.  He was using it as a great individual example about philosophy.  The folks attacking him piled onto the tree and completely missed the forest.  For our educated HN readers, imagine a modern Plato telling the &quot;allegory of the cave&quot; and a bunch of people declaring Plato an idiot because they personally don&#x27;t live in a cave and they use lightbulbs not camp fires, therefore the whole story and everything it implies is completely useless to everyone.   That&#x27;s a pretty good summary of the negative reaction to the ice cream saga.<p>I don&#x27;t think that flexible creative thinking, and self control, fit in very well with the modern mass media advertising narrative;  Its an existential threat to them.

How soon until you need clearance to do serious work in any number of areas?<p>How soon until giving up those rights is part of doing business?

I know of other subfields where the same is true.<p>Maybe it is time that we start protecting the rights of all and not pretending like those who have security clearances are an extremely rare exception whose rights can be waived without issue.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the rules should be that anyone can disclose whatever classified information they like, because obviously that doesn&#x27;t work.

How is that fragmenting?<p>Situation: there are two operating systems, A and B. Someone who wants to target all the devices on the market has to write two apps, one for A, one for B. This is fragmentation.<p>Introducing a third operating system, C, means that someone who wants to target all the devices on the market now has to write <i>three</i> apps: one for A, one for B, one for C. This is, arguably, more fragmentation, since you have more apps to write.<p>Does it really matter what A, B and C are actually called? Android is the latest entry to the mobile operating systems market (save for ghosts like WebOS). If anything, it was one of the <i>driving</i> factors of fragmentation.<p>> But if you need to target all 800 devices that your customers use in the end, the iPhone turns out to be much different from an Android 4.0 device than Android 4.3.<p>How?

Would this really solve fragmentation?<p>I, for instance, would prefer that the industry adopt six or eight standard screen sizes and stick the fuck with them. Google is in a position where it can mandate that, actually.<p>There are many excuses one can make in Google&#x27;s favour, but this does not take away the fact that their development environment is very poor, <i>primarily</i> due to fragmentation (and then there&#x27;s development tools and documentation, but those have been traditionally been a stumbling point).<p>Also, it&#x27;s intelectually rude to try to rest your arguments on words for which you construct your own meaning. That&#x27;s what salespeople do and it&#x27;s a marginal improvement (in technique, not in correctness) of the straw man sophism.<p>> &quot;operating system&quot; is a very generic expression. For most people today an operating system is the software that is installed on the device minus applications that the user installed himself.<p>&quot;Operating system&quot; is a very clear expression that means exactly one thing.<p>Fragmentation can mean more things, and this article claims one of them. People who want to write software for the iOS operating system have a small set of screen sizes and resolutions to target. People who want to write software for the Android operating system have a fuckload of incompatible APIs, screen sizes and resolutions to target, <i>which is exactly what fragmentation means</i>. This is especially problematic for small apps: if you need 3 weeks to write the core of your application, and 1 day to tweak each combination of obscure resolution and screen size, strange device, hardware configuration range <i>and</i> API version you can easily end up doubling your development time.<p>Also, if you actually try your hand at writing an application with a decent UI, you&#x27;ll find that the &quot;a little&quot; you want to tweak it is &quot;a lot&quot;. In my experience, if you try to target a full set of platforms, ranging from small phones to full HD tablets, you actually end up designing 3 UIs from scratch (unless you want at least two of them to feel like someone stretched or compressed the other one to fit a screen it wasn&#x27;t designed to). This includes entire sections of the UI logic (e.g. redesigning navigation flow), and while there are tools to help you with it (such as Fragments), it doesn&#x27;t take away the pain.",1375208505

It&#x27;s certainly more convenient for me to go the grocer and know that, usually, they&#x27;ll have bananas for sale. However, during the summer in my town there is a farmers market every week, where I actually <i>can</i> go and buy produce off the back of a truck. The prices are often cheaper and the products are often better. (Sometimes the prices are higher, but that&#x27;s because the products are better: organic, varieties that don&#x27;t ship well, etc.)<p>I can take this one step further, and actually go to many of the farms around here to buy produce right off the plants, by picking it myself.

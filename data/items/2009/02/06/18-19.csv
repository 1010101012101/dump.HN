How do you reconcile this with advice found on thefunded and other places, that tells entrepreneurs to never pay to pitch?<p>If you charged $1,000 on contingency, or a percentage of funds raised, then I'd be your best supporter.<p>Maybe I'm showing my bias, since I believe in helping entrepreneurs get started with no upfront cash. You probably think that anything contingent may be hard to enforce. That's certainly true. But think of it this way: if my startup has an agreement with AngelSoft that says I owe you something, when big VCs come in for due diligence, they'll flag the issue and force me to resolve it. So you have some protection!<p>If you don't like contingent payment because you are worried that the sucess rate is too low, then you have a major problem. You'd better be selling a service that works. By accepting contingencies, you signal to me, the entrepreneur, that you believe in the quality of your product. I'll have no problem paying fees way higher than $250.<p>There is a minor issue of filtering the quality of the deal flow, but $250 is probably not the right filter.<p>- Alain, CEO, FairSoftware.net :-)",1233946747

470150,comment,469880,470090,0,0,gjm11,,,"You certainly can have evidence against something that doesn't exist. There is very strong evidence that there are no (ordinary) elephants in the room I'm in right now, for instance: elephants are large and easy to see, and the fact that I see none when I look around <i>is</i> evidence for their absence. Direct evidence that there are no invisible miniature elephantoids made from weakly-interacting Dark Matter in the room, of course, is harder to come by.<p>Similarly: If someone believes in a god who regularly answers prayers, works miracles, etc., then a shortage of miracles and surprisingly answered prayers is evidence against the existence of that person's god. If someone else believes in a god whose primary objective is to avoid notice, it's hard to see how anything could be evidence for or against its existence. (And, by the same token, it's hard to see why anyone would care much whether it exists or not. A god whose existence we can't get evidence about is ipso facto one that makes little difference to how the world is.)<p>... Except that it's pretty plausible that some sort of formalized Ockham's Razor works, where your initial evaluation of how likely something is looks more or less like 2^-(length of shortest complete description). In that case, a universe with a maximally-self-hiding god is much less likely than a universe without one.<p>Anyway, most theists believe in gods that <i>are</i> (perhaps intermittently) active in the world: answering prayer, healing sick people, raising people from the dead, etc. There's no reason why there shouldn't be evidence for or against the existence of such a god. (I think the evidence is heavily against; others disagree.)",1233946568

In that light, I am disappointed that the moderators have decided to mark dead anything that has to do with religion, since Hacker News is one of the few sites where the populace has the intellectual maturity to handle the topic.

I am willing to bet that few Greeks literally believed that a god carried the sun across the sky in a chariot. Rather, religion fulfills many cultural and social functions that our increasingly secular world has not yet found good substitutes for.<p>I went to church on Christmas to hear some carols, and I was struck by the fact that I was actually surrounded by people from different age groups and with different life experience from myself. The younger folk helped out the old when they got sick, and the older folk helped the people with little children when they needed a sitter. This kind of social cohesion doesn't exist in secular society, where I spend 99% of my time surrounded by people within a five-year age interval.

470108,comment,469620,470020,0,0,gamerates,,,"Understandable, that's why there is the debate about teaching kids about condoms in school. Does teaching them about sex education and condom usage undermine the argument that you shouldn't have sex? I feel like at least here we can look at some scientific data to reach a conclusion (that with the suicide example, we wouldn't be able to).<p><a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3071001/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3071001/</a>\n""In a study of 35 sex education programs around the world, the World Health Organization found there is no evidence that comprehensive programs encourage sexual activity.<p>The study also concluded that abstinence-only programs are less effective than comprehensive classes that include abstinence and safe-sex practices such as contraception and condom use.""<p>At the same time it reminds me of a scene from the movie ""Mean Girls"" a comedy about the American High School where the gym teacher (who somehow in most high schools is also the ""health teacher"") uncomfortably states:<p>""Don't have sex, because you will get pregnant and die! Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up, just don't do it, OK, promise? OK, now everybody take some rubbers.""<p>However, if having sex puts you at a high risk of infinite punishment forever (instead of infinite reward forever) it sort of changes the argument which is why the two sides have difficulty even discussing the topic. It's also why there are claims that after more and more studies show that sex education doesn't increase promiscuity (but it does reduce STD and teen/unwanted pregnancy rates), and the documented failures of abstinence only education, that even <i>then</i> many Christian groups will always say the studies are flawed. This is because the question was never open to debate in the first place, it was a divine infalliable law and we just need to keep running the tests until we get the predetermined <i>correct</i> answer. That's sort of where I see people arguing that many Christian groups are opposed to science. They love science, as long as it agrees with them (the same can we said for many secular liberals as well as Larry Summers found out).<p>I also think the Catholic church will reverse it's position on contraception for married couples within my lifetime.

However, doing the exact same sex-for-pleasure while preventing pregnancy act by using a piece of technologically simple latex that also protects against STI's is an awful sin.<p>However, due to the vast pluralism of viewpoints in society and our governments responsibility to not endorse any set religion, they suppose to consider the heaven/hell side of the argument in it's policy decisions. It should of course allow others to consider it independently, and thus we have an opt-out program with our sex education.",1233945153

Through the language of their bodies, the husband tells the wife ""I am yours,"" the wife tells the husband ""I am yours.""<p>As a gift, it is necessarily permanent. It's more than impolite to give a gift and then ask for it back. It's also exclusive -- you don't give someone a gift and then take it back and give it someone else -- the original recipient would rightly be aggrieved at such a turn of events (""Hey, you said that was mine!"")<p>While all of marriage subsumes this gift of self, sex forms the act -- the sign -- signifying the gift. Sex is a physical expression, in the concrete language of the body, of the mutual self-gift that the husband and wife made to each other in marriage. The human reproductive organism consists of two persons: a man and a woman. Their union thus not only signifies their mutual gift of self to each other, but also serves as a creative act, a procreative act that generates life. Thus sex is both unitive and procreative, or in vernacular alliterative, both babies and bonding.<p>All that leads the Church to say that ""the deliberate use of the sexual faculty, <i>for whatever reason</i>, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose.""",1233943968

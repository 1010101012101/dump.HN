You can &#x27;sniff&#x27; the modem control pins, its almost certainly the standard  plain &#x27;AT&#x27; command set used for these modems, at 9600 or 57600 baud, 3.3V logic<p>The plug in module looks a lot like a SIM300 or Spreadtrum 5100b. It probably had an IMEI sticker that was pulled off. Theres probably a dozen makers of nearly identical modems during that time period. This one looks fairly old since its a plug-in type. I&#x27;d guess the GSM module is at least 5 yrs old<p>On the other side is a standard 32-pin NAND flash, you could desolder and then use a NAND-reader kit (google etc) to suck the data off. its probably just the GPS coordinates stored between modem data uploads.<p>SIM holder, some crystals, power circuitry, and a (95% sure) uBlox GPS - the uBlox have that funny shape and pinout. uBlox have high sensitivity so a good choice! unclear which generation this us, they&#x27;re up to Neo-8. You could decap it to find out.<p>probably the most fun could be had by first figuring out the RX/TX pins from the microcontroller to the GSM/GPRS module, then soldering thin wires to that and listening with a UART TTL cable. Put in a new SIM, wait a few seconds for the GSM module to get onto the cell network, then quickly faraday it up and see what website, IP address or phone number the micro is trying to connect to. ymmv tho, might just be a random drop point.<p>(theres a bunch of chips with no clear markings, could be motion/accel/gyro or other sensors - @ioerror if you post up the #s on each chip it&#x27;ll be easier to tell! :)<p>edit: i thought about the huge coin cell battery backup. its a bit odd, quite large sized! if its well designed, the microcontroller will detect that the battery has been disconnected, and while on backup coin cell power quickly erase the NAND flash and microcontroller memory :(",1425704378

9161044,comment,9157075,9160237,0,0,azakai,,,"Furthermore, there is little reason to suspect Vivaldi might become major. It brings nothing substantially new on the tech side - it&#x27;s using Blink, like Chrome and Opera, and like Opera, it only differentiates itself from Chrome on the UI side.<p>Many browsers have differentiated only on the UI side; none have really succeeded. As another example, Flock.<p>The 4 actually major browsers <i>have</i> all brought major new innovations: Firefox was a different rendering engine than IE (and much better in pretty much every aspect, except legacy website support); Safari launched with WebKit (a new major fork of KHTML with many improvements); Chrome in turn launched using a major fork of WebKit (bringing process isolation and a completely new JS engine, v8).<p>Vivaldi brings nothing like that to the table. It&#x27;s interesting to see new UI ideas, of course. But for the article to call it &quot;the first new major browser in many years&quot; makes me immediately wonder if the author doesn&#x27;t own Vivaldi stock (which of course is not the case; but the point is that it seems unjustifiably positive on the product).",1425704076

If Coors can crank out Blue Moon in volume and price it below a similar craft beer, then they&#x27;ve got a viable market.  If they&#x27;re pricing Blue Moon the same as similar craft beers, then their margins are much wider than the craft brewers.<p>If a mock-craft beer and a craft beer taste equally good and cost the same, it&#x27;s a good idea to support diversity by buying the craft brew.

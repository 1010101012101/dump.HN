337964,comment,337746,337889,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"> The difference here is that inheritance is more like a node graph and a not top-down hierarchy, where the only real root object is the super-generic ""object"" object.<p>Right, although there isn't necessarily an Object that everything inherits from.<p>You have an object, whose properties (both value fields and methods) are contained in a string-keyed table. If you want to inherit from it, you create another (probably via a method called ""new"") which defers to it when anything tries to find keys the new object hasn't overridden.<p>If you think of the initial object as a Class object that instantiates instances, that's the idea, but you <i>don't need</i> to have an explicit class for something you'll only ever have one instance of - you can just build it in place. (Want a singleton? Don't give it a method that spawns new instances. Done.) It's more generalized than OO systems in which Classes and instances are two fundamentally different things.<p>It may be helpful to read the chapter on OO in _Programming in Lua_ (linked above): It has a very concise intro to prototype-based OO. Lua may also be worth a look since you're interested in game development -- it is quite popular as an embedded scripting language in the game industry (and a pretty cool language in general, I think :) ).<p>Also, see: <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ClassesPrototypesComparison"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ClassesPrototypesComparison</a>",1224517745

Look for suborbital commercial flights within 20 years after production (anybody remember how long it took jets to go from the military to commercial sector?)<p>My question involves the end-state -- you've got some expensive hardware sitting on a hot LZ with no way to leave. Whatever they develop, it's going to have to have the ability to leave the LZ and return home to be worth the expense. Perhaps some kind Osprey-docking system with the Osprey taking the place of the mothership?<p>I don't think forward-deployment is a viable alternative, mainly due to training issues -- hard to cross-train and intensively train folks scattered all over hither and yon. There's also the fact that hardware comes out of one budget and people come out of another. For some reason it seems easier to get a new stealth bomber funded than a division of marines.",1224516374

It's what pissed me off every day with Vista. Microsoft added features that look ""Mac-like"" but without the inherent usability.<p>For instance, that window display where they're all sideways and you can scroll through them. I'm certain that's a rip off of Expose on the Mac. The difference is that Expose provides a very quick-n-easy way to access your windows, whereas that display seemed like it didn't make things particularly easy. And I forget if I tested it, but I very much doubt that it was a spring-loaded view, either.<p>The Aero theme is another instance. Compare that to Leopard's Aqua. They're both attempts to look modern and beautiful, but Leopard goes about it my making all of its chrome minimal. The buttons are small, the borders on every last window are 1px. With Vista, you get bulk hanging off of every window and the buttons look cartoony.<p>I won't go into the OS operations, because - again - I think that anything that I say will only invite flaming on the other side, and frankly I'm sick and tired of Hacker News having the same fucking OS wars that every other social news site does, and I don't want to flame things. But OS X feels like a complete solution in a way. Every part of it has been lovingly slavered over to perfection. From the feel of the computers to small things like the message windows (there was an article here talking about on OS X message windows are more direct than their Win/Lin equivalents) things are polished to a fault.

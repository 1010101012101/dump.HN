He can still manipulate the car concept as easily as if he knew the word for it.<p>Or some people have very small vocabularies, simply because they have been exposed to a small number of words - does that affect their cognitive skills?<p>Abstract though and language may not be fundamental different things, I don't have enough information to say. But what I am saying in my post is that first you think in a concept, then you translate it into a word. You don't think in the word first. So you can think without needing to translate it into words. The relationship between the words and the concepts is of course strong, because we use words to vocalize the concepts we have.<p>Think about it - what is a word actually? It's just a series of sounds we create in the air. So the sound of a word is quite irrelevant to the concept behind it - the construction of the word is not relevant. Imagine we did not have mouths but instead we communicated by flashing a series of pictures in the air. The part of us that creates these pictures is just a sensory IO appliance like our eyes or mouth. Would that change us in any fundamental way? No - we would construct a similar grammar and communication method with pictures as we would with words.<p>What this implies is that the words themselves are unimportant, they are just representations of concepts we are dealing with. This representation can take many forms - but because we are used to vocalising our thoughts, when we do indeed think, we automatically prepare the things we are dealing with for vocalisation, leading to the illusion that words are actually involved.<p>What happens this is that this vocalisation becomes a sort of feedback loop for your thoughts - you think of concepts, convert them into words, then reabsorb the words to be reprocessed as if someone told you them. That is, they come back in as if you were listening to them from other people. You can observe this sometimes with people when they mutter to themselves. When we rehear our own thoughts, we can sometimes process them better (for reasons I don't know). But this step is optional, one can also do it without reprocessing, though this will fail with very abstract things that actually need concepts alien to us.",1228557575

388008,comment,387921,387988,0,0,wheels,,,"<i>Nobody thinks in English or any language.</i><p>That's a pretty bold statement that many eminent linguists and psychologists would disagree with.<p>From my limited knowledge of linguistics what I've gathered is that current thoughts are that people think in symbols, which are often words, and that our abilities to think in many types of abstract thought are directly connected to the language faculty of the brain.  Modern linguistics is driving towards there being a fundamental underlying universal grammar in which human languages can be seen as specializations of.<p>The unification of cognitive psychology and linguistics seems to be one of the goals at the moment, and there is the notion that abstract thought and language aren't fundamentally different things.",1228556678

If all you think is 'don't hit that rock' 'don't hit that rock' 'don't hit that rock' guess where your focus is? Guess what you will likely  end up doing?""<p>I see Google's mantra in the same light. It is far better to focus on DOING something than NOT DOING something. ""Be good"" is a far better mantra to have, and that's before all the good reasons you cited, Paul.<p>Thanks for the essay, have been looking for some inspiration lately and had forgotten about YC and your essays.",1228556278

And if you do not attach a picture to something - what do you see?<p>Tennis.<p>So, did you see a racket, people playing tennis or something else as you read the word? And if not, what did happen as you skimmed from paragraph to paragraph?<p>edit:<p>Hmm. I just realized that when I read a list of words [ball, car, frisbee] I don't visualize anything, but when I think of any of the words individually I do visualize. Even when just writing down a simple list. That's peculiar.<p>edit 2:<p>It can only mean one thing - that when reading you don't think at all about the nouns. Obvious in retrospect. This also explains why you immediately forget a list when just reading over it, but recall perfectly when you visualize each item for an instant.<p>edit 3:<p>> Just go through a list of interconnected things<p>For most people this should be really difficult when listening to music with lyrics, and really easy in a quiet environment.

I want to say ""write more"", but I'm not sure there is anything left to say.  But you should definitely write a blog post about this, if you're interested.<p>I find it interesting that you discovered this at such a young age.  Maybe that's one reason it's so natural for you not to think in a language.<p>By the way, roughly how fast do you read?  (Extremely fast, average, very slow, etc.)",1228554675

For the first year-ish of my startup it was a slow ramp up to the hours/comittment talked about in these articles. I used to read these articles and feel like I was doing something wrong, or was going to fail, because I did have a healthy life and relationship.<p>But when we started having real customers and real investors and real competitors.... excuse the pun, shit got real. I've become a classic startup 'cocky jerk' - and I love it. I'm losing my hair faster than otherwise, but I've never felt so alive.<p>My gf takes the long term perspective. Luckily she started grad school around the same time my work ramped up, so we're both busy. She also knows I have a few years window to really do this (we're 28, want kids in early 30s) so I've got to give it my all. Make the time together really really great when you get a moment, and take a long term perspective. She knows, success or not, when I'm 40 family will be priority #1 and understands I've got a once in a lifetime opportunity for a short window of years.<p>It works for us, for now.

She fully supported everything I needed to do to become successful and was never short on support. However, I made sure that I made time for her and reminded her that in my heart, she's first.<p>2) She was willing to lend me money. Always offered to but my pride never let me do that, and it turned out just fine anyway.<p>3) Was willing to have plenty of ""staying in nights."" She never asked for fancy schmancy meals unless I offered, and she sacrificed plenty of fancy dates just so I would stop worrying about money.<p>These three things are just a really small sample of the great things she's done to support me, and now that things are better off, I make sure I spend a lot more time making her happy and compensating for some of the stuff I messed up with in that year.<p>The moral?

Finished a CS bachelors in a no-name school. Took up online poker and did well until Uncle Sam froze the big sites. The one where I had most money turned out to be a giant ponzi scheme, so I won't likely see a dime from there. Currently have $4,000 to my name and back with parents.<p>Having hit rock bottom, I have decided to do whatever it takes (within conscience) to make my first million and have enough so that I can move on to solving more interesting problems in life than, ""How do I eat next month.""<p>Here is where you come in. Put yourself in my shoes for a second; you are a soon-to-be ""babe in the woods"" entrepreneur with complete freedom of living anywhere in the U.S. on a shoestring budget. You have limited skills in C, HTML, Ruby, and Rails, but have a desperate hunger for freedom that comes from having wealth. You are also practically unemployable because you hate working for someone else for a regular wage, even if it's self-employment. You need freedom.<p>Further constraints:<p>Willing to live with up to two other people whose main focus is generating wealth.<p>Not willing to live on Ramen or to work 16 hour days, simply because my long term health more important than generating wealth in the quickest manner. I mostly eat whole foods that I cook myself and I need 8.5-9 hours of sleep. However, I would be willing to use natural stimulants in moderation to increase performance when needed.<p>Have lingering remnants of social anxiety from younger days. Working very hard right now to eradicate all of them, and can be fully functional (and even charismatic) in most social situations. Still, anxiety is high in most novel social situations, but nothing that can't be overcome with full immersion. But networking or sales performance might be impaired until more experience was acquired.<p>Have had bad experiences with callous / borderline sociopath personalities in the past, so working in finance would probably be out of the question (please correct me if I am wrong on this!).<p>Any thoughts on how you might proceed if you were in my shoes? Remember, you have $4,000 and complete freedom and focus. Your priority is to first get out of parents' place and move to a place best for wealth generation given the above constraints. You also need to find housemates with similar focus and to quickly get some cash before the $4,000 runs out (not necessarily in that order).<p>Thanks in advance for any and all advice.",1320339178

So you walk through some low-intensity infrared beams... so what? It's not going to magically fry you. Energy levels sufficient to scare off mosquitoes are probably barely perceptible to humans in any way. Lasers aren't magically dangerous.<p>On the other hand, the badly underestimated danger of lasers is their ability to focus retina-damaging amounts of energy into your eye in less time than it takes you to blink, which in this case I mean fully literally and not at all figuratively. Blinking is basically your only defense against lasers that might blind you and if you can't deploy it in time, that means you're defenseless. Anything that can burn a mosquito down in flight is probably enough to burn at least some of your retina, too. I can't believe some of the lasers we sell without permits; if you've got a laser that can pop a balloon from across the yard you are playing with something that can burn out your vision with only a moment's inattention.

I'm sure that this is a good thing (tm) for most users, and will help avoid all sorts of problems.  But the Mac's becoming more of an appliance, and while it's safer, easier, and more convenient for most users, it makes it a substantially less desirable machine for me to hack on.<p>There's a tradeoff between making the developer environment and user environment closer together -- to make the machine more amenable for hacking, to reduce the wall for development, and to make the platform a good place to learn how to write code -- vs farther, to make it a simpler, safer environment for users.  So far, the bias has been on the former, but it's changing.<p>What's interesting is that this may, for the time being, push app development server-side (to the web) as the client environments become more hack-inhospitable.",1320339133

However when you look at SAMHSA surveys and other research whites and blacks use & sell drugs at about the same rates.<p>Looking at violent crime on the other hand (murder in particular) blacks to appear to commit those crimes at higher rates, but in terms of raw numbers, those results are minuscule compared to the number of folks imprisoned every year (something like hundreds, maybe a couple of thousand per year IIRC).<p>I'm doing this from memory so I can't point you to the exact sources of this information (I'm one of the several thousand Massachusetts residents who lost power last weekend and I'm writing this via smartphone) but it comes from SAMHSA and BJS data (and to a lesser extent UCR although that's not quite as useful for these discussions).

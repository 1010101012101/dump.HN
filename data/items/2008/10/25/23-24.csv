343905,comment,343872,343872,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Nifty, though having used both languages I don't know why you would want to use Java instead of Objective-C. Plus it's not the language that matters most, it's the Cocoa libraries, which you'll still need to use anyway (I suppose that could be an argument <i>for</i> using whatever language you're comfortable with, but I feel Objective-C is particularly well suited for Cocoa)<p>It seems a little ridiculous to convert Java source code to Java bytecode to XML, then use XSLT to convert to Objective-C source code, but I guess if it works...<p>Also, there's a few inaccuracies:<p>a) Apple isn't just <i>planning</i> on adding garbage collection to Objective-C, Objective-C 2.0 <i>already</i> has it (though it's not available on iPhone, for whatever reason)<p>b) He says it's a downside that there's no strong compile time type checking, but really the warnings the compiler gives you that your class hierarchy doesn't implement a selector are pretty much equivalent to the Java compiler telling you it can't find a method. Just enable -Werror if you want to treat warnings as errors.",1224978021

343900,comment,343594,343700,0,0,neilc,,,"<i>less complex languages - i.e, languages that abstract away difficulty</i><p>That is a very anomalous definition of complexity. In truth, a language that is more complex may or may not be more abstract. For example, Prolog operates at a very high level of abstraction, and it is far less complex than a language like C++.<p><i>C++ is less complex than C</i><p>C++ allows programs to be written at a higher level of abstraction than C, but it is not less complex than C by any reasonable definition of ""complexity"". In fact, it is the very existence of the C++ tools for abstraction (classes, templates, virtual functions, MI) that cause much of C++'s language complexity. Perhaps you are conflating the complexity of the <i>language</i> with the complexity of a typical program written in that language?",1224977569
343899,comment,343693,343885,0,0,Retric,,,"Free trade is generally a net gain for the world, but it also tends to increase consumption which is not necessarily a good idea.  For example if local industry is more carbon efficient then we might increase global pollution for little real gain.  Ditto for cases like Mad Cow disease etc.<p>Due to differences in regulation I don't want to see Chinese drug manufactures shipping drugs to the US.  I don't mind if US or EU companies manufacture in China but the potential harm from contaminated drugs IMO outweighs the potential cost reductions.<p>Granted for bulk goods like Lumber, Steel, and Oil it's probably a pure net win.<p>PS: I find it offensive that Bill Gates has a lower effective tax rate than I do, but I don't see that changing any time soon.  I am for an all inclusive flat tax with zero tax breaks of any kind, but I don't see anyone jumping on that bandwagon.  AKA you don't treat stock ownership different than home ownership, and there is no cap on Social Security, and there is no charitable giving tax break etc.  (Federal, State, and Local tax inclusive.)",1224977467

The only reason I care about Clojure is 'persistent' data structures that give us some chance of writing code that /just, maybe, possibly/ will execute usefully on the 1024+-core boxes we're going to be using shortly. That's the only reason I care about it, and I'd say that's fundamentally the design of the language.",1224976536

343885,comment,343693,343864,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Most economists (~90%) think free trade is a huge net positive for the world. Paul Krugman, the most prominent living left-wing economist, is a unabashed supporter of trade. Obama demonizes it. Krugman is much closer to McCain than Obama on free trade.<p>Obama wants to raise taxes because there is no place to cut a $3 trillion budget. In fact, he wants to add many new expenditures to that budget. Many smart people seem to have gotten caught up in his class-warrior socialist rhetoric, but the truth is we all lose when government punishes the productive sectors of society through taxation.<p>Subsidies? Every economist I know and most environmentalists are against corn and ethanol subsidies. McCain had the balls to make a stand against them at a debate IN IOWA, a notorious corn state. Obama realizes that handouts win votes, and spinelessly sticks by them.<p>Healthcare? The big healthcare problem in the United States is cost, not access. See <a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/09/getting_real_about_health_care.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/09/getting_re...</a> . McCain wants to address the cost of healthcare. Obama is all about access. I think Obama is wrong on the issue.<p>Energy: Obama promises to subsidize various technologies out the wazoo, but we have seen little return from previous billion-dollar efforts.<p>Your last sentence illustrates the religion-like fervor that has developed around Obama and the intellectual bankruptcy of his movement. I won't be voting for McCain, but I have no illusions that Saunt Obama is going to save the world.<p>I'm sorry I stated the case against your savior. I hadn't realized that Hacker News had turned into reddit, and that any comment against the one with the Kennedy smile was worthy of downvotes.",1224975735
343884,comment,343476,343725,0,0,iigs,,,"I disagree, or agree only superficially. IT departments start off as innocuous places where the guy who knows how to fix the copier hides, but as things grow they're responsible for maintaining the security and availability of the company's information assets. So long as the data is not of strategic value it won't rouse the attention of the executive level management, but as awareness of the value of the data grows (read: data loss, security issue, or regulatory violation) you can bet CIOs will create policies prohibiting use of external systems, and crack down on violators.<p>So, I think cloud computing will afford a small window of flexibility for companies, but will ultimately get rolled in to the larger IT picture. If so, however, it will probably increase flexibility in IT department policies, which is good news for everyone -- IT executives look good if they're flexible, leaf nodes don't get any joy from telling people no, and the IT department customers get more of what they need with less red tape.",1224975695

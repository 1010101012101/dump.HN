There are only two ways to name multiword identifiers, this-is-a-multiword-identifier or this_is_a_multiword_identifier.  Both take the same amount of space, and the lisp-version is easier.  No serious programmer would write thisIsAMultiwordIdentifier, so it doesn't matter that it's shorter.  It saves a few bytes, but it will ensure that your program is completely unreadable.",1216670304

252620,comment,252480,252480,0,0,Shooter,,,"If you focus your idea more, I think you might have something. I founded and funded a company that did something along these lines, although I think our portfolio company was a bit more focused on trying to solve specific problems and generate revenue.<p>Our portfolio company developed watches and mobile (cellphone) software that worked with biofeedback attachments to monitor various aspects of health for users.  It all integrated with an online system, which tracked location and company/community trends, among other things.  There were games that helped people lower their blood pressure, etc.  There were also systems to monitor wakefulness, to predict heart attacks and strokes, etc.  I think we had around 80 specific use cases.  We were working with an EAP company and several wellness/insurance companies.<p>All of this is past tense, because the company never made it to market.  We presented at a single tradeshow and were promptly sued by about a dozen companies.  We also got cease-and-desist letters from quite a few major companies (Nokia has several patents in this area, for example.)<p>Just like with location-based apps, there are a slew of overly broad patents that seem to tie up most of the basic functionality you would want in such a device/service.\nMany startups don't realize the unbelievable amount of 'IP' that has already been sewn up by companies in these areas.  The patent holders don't usually go after you until you announce a big funding round or gain some traction in the market.  We had to write off most of our investment because we weren't equipped to fight the legal battle at the time.<p>There are a ton of startups that are still working in this area, though...and I think there is a huge market.  If someone can figure out a way to circumvent the existing patent mess, I would be interested in investing again.<p>From a hacker point of view, there are some interesting open-source projects.

The engineers closed those holes after the fact when the internet started opening UNIX machines to the outside world.<p>NT actually has an enormous edge on security because of its roots in VMS rather than in UNIX, since as gaius pointed out, VMS places far more of an emphasis on security than UNIX did until the internet made it necessary.",1216669080
252607,comment,252333,252333,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The vast majority of security issues we see (and we see a lot of them--systems management has been how I make my living for about ten years, likewise for my co-founder) are not related to web apps at all.  They come from basic misunderstandings of the underlying system and the software that runs their services.<p>So, here's the first three recommendations I make to pretty much everyone concerned about security (which should be everyone with a machine connected to the Internet):<p>1. Use strong passwords.  A strong password is 8+ characters long, has numbers, letters and optionally symbols.  A strong password is changed every year or so.  A strong password does not contain dictionary words.<p>2. Update your software.  If you use Linux, use one that has good package management and a long lifecycle so that packages are easy to install and will be available for the three+ years that the average server is in service.  CentOS/RHEL and Debian are the only ones I really trust on servers.  Ubuntu LTS releases will do, in a pinch.  If your system does not make it <i>really</i> easy to do this, then you need a better OS.  Imagine the worst possible time for a security problem to show up--you're at the beach with no WiFi for miles and all you can do is call someone to walk them through the process--and if that sounds scary, then you've got a problem.  It's pretty easy to say, ""OK, login to the system using PuTTY (or better, Webmin, but I won't demand that everyone run our software) and type 'yum update httpd'"", or 'apt-get install apache2', if it's a Debian system.  But imagine, ""OK, go to Apache.org, and click on the download link...oh, wait, click on HTTP Server, and then click on download.  Now download the latest one.  No, not to your local machine...download it to the server.  Use wget.  Yeah.  Type wget and paste the link from the Apache website.  OK, now untar it.  No, type in 'tar zxvf blah-blah-blah'.  OK, look for the previous Apache version directory, because we need to copy the default configuration over.  I don't remember what it's called...""  etc.  Careful with stuff installed from sources other than native packages is what I'm saying here.  You'll have to do it for a few things, obviously, and your own app will probably be in SVN or git, but don't make it a habit to get everything from non-standard sources.  It's just a security disaster waiting to happen.<p>3. Don't run unneeded services.  If you don't know what it is, google it.  If you don't need it, turn it off.  If it exposes a port to the Internet, keep a very close eye on updates for that service.  CentOS/RHEL and Debian usually roll out security fixes within hours of exploits being discovered...this is usually good enough.  If your database doesn't need a public port, run it on localhost.  If you do have a separate database server, see if your host can give you a private network for your web servers and backend database(s).  Some won't even charge extra for private connections between multiple boxes in the same data center (though most will charge a few bucks).  If they're not on the same physical segment, this generally won't be possible, though.<p>This is the low-hanging fruit, and should be standard practice for pretty much everybody with servers to manage.",1216669033

But if you are questioning passions for ideas and entrepreneurship, then my feeling is different from yours.<p>When I first read the post on YC by PG, I understand PG tried to tell people this is not an inclusive list. All ideas put down by PG have a common pattern. It is PG's motto: ""making something that people want"". And PG also alerted the would-be applicants that not every problem is solvable only by purely engineering or computer science. Some problems require much clever hacks to acquire user bases and break out stereotypes in jaded users' mind. Of courses, some ideas that PG pointed out are traditionally viewed by startups as ""suicidal"" to get into territory of MS/Google.<p>I guess you feel frustrated because as a CS student, you probably think about the best things to save the world is to do something CS cool. But in reality, what a CS graduate can do to make people live better is probably to create an application that frustrate end user less than what users are using now. This seems so uncool. It takes more passion to care about my users to make them happy than to make myself happy. I can be happy for creating some cool hacks. But to make my users happier takes me more patience to know what they really want, more thought and effort to figure how can I create a better product. Though Model T is not a Ferrari, but I know my users are happily driving around to make their life better.",1216668147

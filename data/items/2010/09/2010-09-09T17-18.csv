None that I'm aware of matched Apples exact dpi but then again, they had no need to exactly quadrupel the pixel count in the original iPhone while still being roughly the same size.<p>As far as the aluminium goes Apple has fetishised their materials choices for a long time and had as many hits as misses e.g. ""Titanium"" paint that flakes off, White iBooks that discolored, white iPhone 4s that they can't manufacture. Others generally don't bother as their customers don't want or need it. I'm not sure Apple users do before they are trained to by Apple.",1284055176

As far as I know, their retina display, unibody laptop manufacturing processes, and touch-based trackpad tech are unique to them.

Apple doesn't design their SoC, they don't design or build their touchscreens, they don't build their cases (though they aesthetically design them).<p>Which is probably a good thing because they need to focus on their core competencies (interfaces and visual designs), and leave the specialized companies to make the specialized solutions.

From simple things such as definitions to page rank and beyond, it's important to find a way to grasp the basics.

The folks who are the best at SEO have a wide base of experience gearing content toward diverse audiences.  A combination of knowing what people want and being able to deliver the right message to those people at the right time is as much a part of traditional marketing as it is SEO.  After you learn the technical building blocks of optimization, increasing rank, exposure is more about user interaction and traffic.<p>Experiment with your own content using the help of excellent tutorials like those found on SEOmoz and you'll be well on your way to successfully optimizing pages.  You don't necessarily need to pay for subscriptions, but sometimes it will save you time to have everything assembled in one place and presented in one style.<p>Just remember... it's not about tricking search engines... it's about helping users find the best of whatever they're looking for and for search engines identify and categorize your content properly.",1284054932

That said, wall street tries to value a company's current AND future revenues (with an appropriate discount for risk and earnings out in the future) -- so Pincus is trying to get them to believe it is building the bedrock of a company that will last a hundred years.<p>Right now Zynga is a revenue rocketship (even if you don't like the product, people, or business) that will make Pincus and all their employees wealthy.

The programs may be two or three years, but they are all identifiable by their practical applicability. (The full designation of such institutions is ""Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology"".) Quite apart from that, we have the Universities which, apart from a few professional programs (medicine/dentistry, law, etc.), come with no promise of applicability whatever.

It purports to be based on Jung's type system.  However, a close reading of the relevant section of Jung's <i>Psychological Types</i> reveals the following.  Jung identified eight types.  The descriptions in his book correspond quite closely, in fact, with eight of the Enneagram types.  (The omitted one is the Three.)  Myers and Briggs then took the dimensions Jung had identified and multiplied them out to get 16 types which now correspond more poorly to the Enneagram types.<p>If you don't know about the Enneagram, you might say, ""okay, so what? so they don't correspond well -- that doesn't prove the MBTI is wrong.""  But if you will study the Enneagram you will see there is much more to it.  For instance, the connections between one's type and how one related to one's parents; the spectrum of expressions of each type, from unhealthy to healthy; and the concepts of integration and disintegration, which connect the nine types in a clear, fixed, and quite beautiful structure.  If you prefer not to hear the mystical overtones in that structure, that's certainly your choice, but they're there.<p>The Enneagram is a profound tool for self-understanding and self-improvement.  The MBTI can be a useful place to start for people who are new to self-exploration, but it won't take you nearly as far.",1284052625

Don't run javascript on a production db node. db.eval locks the node it's running on until it finishes, so the performance of that node will go down the tubes. Mapreduce is less bad in this regard because it does yield, but it does so too infrequently. If you want to use mongo's built-in javascript interpreter for anything other than development and administration, set up a slave to run your scripts on.<p>2. Don't use 1.6.1. If you're using 1.6.1 right now, upgrade to 1.6.2. 1.6.1 has a nasty crashing bug that had my mongo node going down about once a day and not coming up without running --repair.<p>3. Evaluate how much data loss costs you. Mongo stages writes in memory, and so if the db crashes hard it's likely that there will be some data that hasn't made it to disk yet. If you're building a social network the cost of some potential data loss is probably much less than the savings in hardare, admin costs, development costs, etc. But if you're a payment processor or a gambling site, stick with postgres.",1284051717

They aren't using features that HTML doesn't have, instead they just want the data-binding features of silverlight and to stick to XAML/C#.  This may be cost effective in the short run, but the author has a point.  In five to ten years, these apps are going to seem incredibly outdated and browser support is not guaranteed.",1284051615

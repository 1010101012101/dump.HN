112422,comment,112215,112215,0,0,tyler,,,"This is an argument that has been going on since the first web apps started to emerge.  The general argument is this: ""You can't implement feature x in a browser"".  Initially the list of features that could not be implemented was quite long.<p>Things like rich-text editing, asynchronous communication, audio, video, drag and drop, sliders, etc. were very hard, or impossible.  So, things like complex games, email clients, im clients, text editors, spreadsheets, and media players were out.<p>And that leads to the problem with his argument.  The list of things which cannot be done on the web is constantly being reduced.  Everything on that list can now be done... and fairly easily.  (Which isn't to say they don't take time.  Complex things take time... easy or not.)<p>So, now people have started saying things like ""Well you can't implement (Photoshop|GIMP|text editors|IDEs|.+) on the web"".  That may be true for some limited amount of time, however, even now inroads are being made in all of the above. (See Heroku)<p>In short, people are going to continue clinging to the sinking ship that is this argument until they finally run out of applications to point at.  If theres one thing I've learned from recent history... its best not to bet against the advancement of technology.",1202514367

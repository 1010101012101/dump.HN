This is a really great summary post.<p>I'm totally unsurprised that Shuttleworth's penchant for decision by fiat and Jobsian cargo-cultishness has driven a wedge between his company and others in the FOSS movement.  (For example window controls, before windicators were announced: ""Yesterday I decided to move window controls to the other side for our LTS.  It's for a secret project.  DO NOT ASK ME WHAT THE PROJECT IS."").

How to use Model-View-Controller (MVC)"" by Steve Burbeck, which describes how Smalltalk did it, it says:<p><pre><code>   In the MVC paradigm the user input, the modeling of the
   external world, and the visual feedback to the user are
   explicitly separated and handled by three types of object,
   each specialized for its task. The view manages the graphical
   and/or textual output to the portion of the bitmapped display
   that is allocated to its application. The controller interprets
   the mouse and keyboard inputs from the user, commanding the model
   and/or the view to change as appropriate. Finally, the model
   manages the behavior and data of the application domain, responds
   to requests for information about its state (usually from the view),
   and responds to instructions to change state (usually from the controller).

In Smalltalk it sounds like input goes straight to controllers--views have no idea input happened unless a controller tells them about it.<p>It's not quite clear to me from the article, but it also looks like maybe the view gets what the information about what to display from the controller (which gets it from the model). In Smalltalk it sounds like the controller would tell the view that the view needs to update, and the view would talk directly to the model to get the data it needs.",1299876895

We haven't really had any blockers that didn't have some sort of reasonable work around. And most of the time the next release of features will eliminate a good chunk of those.<p>We're pretty lucky in that we're part of Microsoft' early adopter programs and get to peek at some features coming down the pipe soon. There is some awesome stuff coming, but of course we're under NDA.<p>There are some extra things to consider but they are more a result of using the Cloud in general. For example, it highly recommended that you add retry logic into your code which makes sql queries. This is because your data is triple replicated and fail overs or db moves can drop your pooled connections.<p>Also as I mentioned in my other comment. There are some limits to Table Storage which you need to account for or you'll find yourself stuck and frustrated. Things like Count,GroupBy,Joins,Distinct,etc are not available.

We decided that only the bare-minimum/must-be-relational data will go into SQL Azure so that the database doesn't grow too fast. Instead, we use Table Storage for the really big data. It does require a big change in the way you think about storing and querying your data though since you lose functions such as Count,GroupBy,Joins,etc.<p>But, there is now something called 'Federations' coming out for SQL Server which will let you automatically and sometimes magically shard your data across multiple database with little maintenance. I'm not sure what the roadmap of that feature is but it eliminates any of the GB cap worries that existed before.<p>The biggest surprise we ran into was the cost of Transactions. Even though you get 10k storage transactions for pennies, it does add up. Especially since every request for items from a queue is a transaction. So a lot of thought has to go into things to make sure parts of the system aren't too 'chatty' when it comes to Azure Storage. You don't have this problem with SQL Azure.

The ad network sees the install and tells Tap Widget to give the user his widget.  The advertiser gets a new user, so the ad network gets paid.  The ad network takes their cut and passes the rest of the money on to Tap Widget.

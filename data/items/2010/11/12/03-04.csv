In this connection it might be worth-while to point out that the purpose of abstracting is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.<p>[...]<p>Now for the fifth argument. It has to do with the influence of the tool we are trying to use upon our own thinking habits. I observe a cultural tradition, which in all probability has its roots in the Renaissance, to ignore this influence, to regard the human mind as the supreme and autonomous master of its artefacts. But if I start to analyse the thinking habits of myself and of my fellow human beings, I come, whether I like it or not, to a completely different conclusion, viz. that the tools we are trying to use and the language or notation we are using to express or record our thoughts, are the major factors determining what we can think or express at all!""",1289533521

1896444,comment,1889152,1891426,0,0,chrischen,,,"> Every other piece of information that Facebook has on me is allowed to be exposed to my friends' apps without me personally connecting with the app.<p>Really? Because I'd love to grab that information for my app. Are you talking about the publicly available information?<p>> The motivation here is crystal clear: e-mail addresses function as (essentially) UIDs on the web as a whole, and someone like Google has billions of these e-mail addresses laying around. But since people started managing parts of their social graphs on Facebook instead of through (say) Gmail, Google's edge graph is starting to get stale. Facebook is terrified of the idea that Google could connect all the Gmail-to-Gmail edges without finding every one of those users.<p>Sure Facebook probably wouldn't want to do that even if there wasn't a privacy issue with letting friends export friends' email addresses. But I don't care about that, I just don't want them to let my friends export my email, and I don't think they have to create that feature. That feature would help google and other sites ride on Facebook's success at the expense of user privacy. I don't care about the former and I would be on Google's side if it were just the former issue but <i>it is not.</i><p>> In order for Google to refresh that graph without e-mail addresses, they'd need every involved user to export their Facebook UID out of Facebook - if I didn't do this myself, then despite the fact that (say) 30 of my Facebook friends are on Gmail, even if every one of them exported from Facebook to Google, Google could never match my Facebook UID to my Google account.<p>> To anyone that doesn't already have a huge userbase, this is not a big deal, but to anyone that does, it's the difference between having effectively zero access to the social graph and being able to reconstruct your users intersection with it with almost perfect resolution.<p>Last time I checked (may have changed) Facebook let's you query email hashes to find the person's friends based on the email hash. Also YOU created those networks on Facebook. Why would you expect Google to magically know that? Sure google is trustworthy, but more importantly why would you want malicious third party site to know your email address?<p>I would love for Facebook make it really easy for sites to use their graph data as easily as possible but Facebook already does this. The people complaining probably haven't even seen the Facebook APIs or even used Facebook. They're just complaining because bashing Facebook for controlling its data is the popular thing to do right now.",1289533351

I also get angry when i see a bigger kid picking on smaller kids. When i see that i go and rough the bigger kid up a bit. From doing this i have seen a huge difference in the bullies at my school. on the note i do recommend going to the teacher first, but if that doesn't work then your on your own",1289530862

But standing up to bullies was still better than backing down.<p>That said, the gang members were rarely if ever the bullies; not unless they suspected you were in a rival gang.  The bullies were the kids that wanted a power trip, mainly the Seniors and mainly the sports guys.<p>If you give in you're doomed to be giving up your money or whatever again and again and again.  You fight back, and that's usually going to be the end of it.  People that fight back aren't fun; the weak ones that cry and give you stuff, that's where the fun is. The bullies want a reward with little effort.  The gangs usually have a personal vendetta against you, your family, your different gang, your race, or something else.  That's a whole different issue and one that's not dealt with in the same simple way.<p>Don't confuse gangs and bullies, they're two very different beasts.",1289530855

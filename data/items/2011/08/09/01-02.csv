2862461,comment,2862003,2862003,13,0,lotharbot,,,"Here's my response from the HN discussion a year ago [0]:<p>-----<p>If Mark Cuban thinks the market is now all about exotic derivatives rather than buying stock in companies you believe in, he's listening to the wrong people. Commission-based brokers talk about exotic derivatives; Warren Buffet still talks about buy-and-hold.<p>The biggest wins and losses in day trading will come from exotic derivatives simply by their nature: they're highly leveraged bets. Those firms that create the vehicles to make those bets aren't ""hackers"", they're ""Vegas"". You ask for a bet against the housing market or for cattle, they set up a structure to let you make that bet, and you play the odds -- and you might beat the other betters in the market over the short term, but it's the house (taking its percentage off the top) that always wins long term. Mark Cuban is right to be uncomfortable playing that game.<p>Meanwhile, people like Warren Buffet continue to look for healthy companies that are underpriced and buy into them for the long term. Day-to-day the market might be driven by short-term bets, but over the course of 3 decades it's still driven by the fundamental health of companies. If anything, those who care about <i>""the performance of specific companies and their returns""</i> benefit from the fact that occasionally, as a result of day traders' bets, healthy companies' stocks get sold at bargain prices.<p>If you try to play Vegas' game, you'll probably get burned. But if you stand back, watch the game, and buy when their game creates a bargain price on good long-term stocks, you stand to get very solid returns.\n-----<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1332422"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1332422</a>",1312855166

From what I can tell, almost everything he wrote applies to these current riots in London.<p>The primary reason that people riot is that rioting is fun.  It gives an immense surge of adrenaline and other hormones, it gives the thrill of chaos and action, of the power of mindless destruction.  In order for a riot to occur there must be some sort of event that acts as a Schelling point or catalyst.  This Schelling point might be a real grievance, or a contrived one.  It might be some innocuous event, like a sports victory.  News of the riot spreads via the news channels of the day - tv, internet, twitter, etc - and the riot snowballs.  The final necessary ingredient is weakness on the part of the police.  If the police are outnumbered, and only allowed to manually arrest with handcuffs, then the rioters will go wild, and even more rioters will join as they realize they suffer no consequence for their actions.  If the police start beating the hell out of people, or even using live rounds, the riot ends fast.<p>Banfield's book is online.

But, there's a lot of kids with nothing to lose and in the last couple of hours they've realised it's a free for all.<p>I'm not justifying anything here just trying to make an analysis: The reason they don't care is because they don't have a hope in hell of getting a job in mainstream society that would pay enough to get them out of the bunk bed in their parents house. London is so expensive to live in and there's a lot of poorly educated young people that are stuck with no chance of an independent life. So the attitude on the street is like 'we can't get it by getting a job and living normally so we're just gonna take it'. There's very little chance of getting caught at the moment, no reason not to. So it's not really <i>random</i> violence and stealing, it's probably even at some level a rational choice to do this if you are someone in this position.<p>The police can't cope because they don't seem to understand how the rioters are organising through BBM and because Britain has relatively fewer police officers per head of population compared to other European countries and the US.<p>Who knows what'll happen next. Twitter is lit up with people saying 'send in the army' at the moment which seems nuts to me but quite frankly seems like anything could happen tonight.",1312851732

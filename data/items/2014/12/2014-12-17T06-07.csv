8761367,comment,8761076,8761273,0,0,D_Alex,,,">I would argue that being limited to a single unit system is like being limited to a single language. In principle, no one needs more than one but in practice the differences in expressiveness for different purposes are interesting and useful.<p>After considerable reflection, I have come to the view that in fact the differences are not interesing and not useful. What is useful though is consistency and ease of application (which the metric system has) and familiarity (which just depends on the circumstances).<p>I work in the oil and gas industry, and I had to learn to think in terms of bizarre units like stcf/bbl, or pounds per gallon. In the end, the only driver was that once you digest enough information, you can compare things on a like-for-like basis... if you know the horsepower ratings of 10 car models, it is more immediately useful to be given the horsepower of the car you consider buying rather than its power output in kW.<p>But in the end I see no downsides, only upsides, if the entire industry switched to the metric system.<p>stcf/bbl (standard cubic feet per barrel)  by the way is a customary measure of the amount of gas dissolved in the oil. After 25 years in the industry, I know for example that 1000 stcf/bbl represents a gassy oil that will take some effort to stabilise, and 100 stcf/bbl is a relatively dead crude... so inormation about new crudes is useful to me in this form. But - what a weird unit it is! The information could much better be provided as a dimensionless ratio, eg gas-to-oil ratio of 200 for gassy oil would be intuitive and better suited to use in further calculations, and once you&#x27;ve seen enough data expressed in this way, the familiarity issue is taken care of.<p>I invite you to provide counterexamples, where the customary unit has an inherent advantage (familiarity does not count). I can&#x27;t think of any.",1418799095

8761356,comment,8761076,8761241,0,0,jacobolus,,,"If we routinely used a base-12 number system, and converted all our units to be base-12, it would have an individually small but collectively massive positive impact on our mathematical fluency. Calculating with fractions vs. “duodecimals” would be a much less dramatic trade-off, and for many everyday calculations converting back and forth between duodecimal and fractional forms would be trivial. We could easily change our systems for time, angular measurement, etc. to the new system in a much more closely backwards-compatible way, and without sacrificing the advantages of the base-60 system. For everyday calculations using physical quantities and measurements, the new system would beat the metric system hands down.<p>While we’re at it, we should probably replace the written numeral graphs with ones that are easy to write a bit more quickly and as difficult to confuse (either for one another, or for alphabet graphs) as we can manage, and change the pronunciation such that all of the basic numerals are one syllable, and regularize and simplify pronunciations of multi-digit numerals. The Chinese have a big leg up on English/Spanish/French/... speakers when it comes to basic arithmetic simply by virtue of their number pronunciation which is regular and fast.",1418798900

The only reason for a base of 10 that I can see is that we have ten fingers. But binary systems map better to a lot of real-world problems.<p>If baking, are you more likely to take a recipe and halve it or cut it by a factor of ten? In construction, are you more likely to subdivide an area into two, or ten? If you split a stock, are you more likely to split two-to-one or ten-to-one?<p>The answer, in all those cases, is the former, which is favored by a binary system. Forcing decimal upon us is what leaves us with numbers like 0.125 rather than 1/8.<p>So rather than move to metric, let&#x27;s come up with a more consistent base-two system, and then we can all use that.

I guess there could be different definitions at play here, but I was talking about a hypothetical developmental stage where most civilizations destroy themselves. E.g. nuclear war, climate change, etc.<p>Regarding how common life is in the universe, I wasn&#x27;t talking about non-intelligent life. I fully expect that we will find signs of such life elsewhere in the cosmos in the next hundred years, either on Mars, Europa, Titan, Enceladus, or perhaps in the atmospheric spectra of some extra-solar planet.<p>No, I was talking about intelligent life, which if iot exists has a very short gestational period before transforming into lasting intelligence(s) expanding into the universe at close to physical limits. In particular the window between development of technology detectable from distant observation (e.g. radio) and a runaway singularity pushing that civilization&#x27;s expansion rate to light speed limits is so small that regardless of the prevalence of intelligent life in the universe, we should <i>expect</i> to see an empty sky. Why? Because for most of the history of the cosmos we see an empty sky in our light cone. Then suddenly the most distant stars start to go dim with strangely shifted spectra, in an expanding wave that flows through visible star systems at >0.9c until it hits us, and ... well who knows what happens then.<p>The Fermi paradox is: &quot;if there are so many intelligences, why can&#x27;t we see them?&quot; The transhumanist response is: &quot;if we could see them, we&#x27;d be dead.&quot; By the anthropic principle we can only expect to exist in the time period where we are alive, not dead, so we should expect with very high probability to see an empty sky, and with very low probability the coming onslaught of darkness.",1418797697

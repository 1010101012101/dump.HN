In theory, yes, we shouldn&#x27;t perpetrate violence or war upon each other. But if those who seek to eliminate violence rely solely on pacifism, it leaves those with no such intentions to perpetuate war uncontested. Should people ignore genocide because they idealize a non-violent future?<p>The thought promoted by the OP (of this idea) seems to imply that by setting an example behavior based on our ideals, others, with no such ideals, will somehow be compelled to adopt them. I just can&#x27;t imagine anyone actually thinks that&#x27;s true.<p>A German citizen in 1940 doesn&#x27;t want anyone to see murder in the world, so he sets an example by NOT THINKING and NOT MENTIONING murder.

11050683,comment,11033539,11047885,0,0,waterlink,,,"> His solution works, but realistically only for small numbers. He never specified an input domain, and during development never tried to identify ambiguities between the API &#x27;promise&#x27; that the function would take int32, the expectation by most that it&#x27;s fast to factor 2,147,483,647 (2^31-1), and the reality that his code would take a long time for that.<p>I think in one of the videos I watched, he explicitly said, that this is lame implementation and can be optimized (for example by looping until square root of the number). The interesting point, is that one wouldn&#x27;t have to change tests for that. One would want to write a benchmark for that, to use instead of test. As in: normal tests are tests for logic, while benchmarks are tests for performance. Additionally, it is always true, that premature optimization is not a good idea. If you have an evidence, that current algorithm is not fast enough (knowledge of your dataset sizes + understanding on what would the reasonable speed be + benchmark to verify all of that), then you optimize, without behavior change.<p>> I think Martin&#x27;s TDD style works because the problem he uses are &quot;simple&quot; in an algorithm sense, which is why he can talk about a &#x27;Transformation Priority Premise&#x27;. Martin says &quot;Refactorings are simple operations that change the structure of code without changing its behavior&quot;, but as I wrote before, &#x27;substitute algorithm&#x27; is not a simple operation.<p>Funny thing I have found about &#x27;SubstituteAlgorithm&#x27; refactoring, is its example here: <a href=""http://refactoring.com/catalog/substituteAlgorithm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://refactoring.com/catalog/substituteAlgorithm.html</a> - it is not changing algorithm, it simply eliminates &#x27;if&#x27; statements. That is something that I usually do naturally, and don&#x27;t even consider underlying algorithm to be changed... So maybe, Martin Fowler, when coining this term, meant something different?<p>> So if you also include coverage and after-the-fact tests, that would be far beyond what I&#x27;ve seen so far in TDD walkthroughs.<p>It is definitely on my mind. Since that is what I usually do. It will be hard to demonstrate code coverage in Crystal, though, since I will have to write a library for that (there is none at the moment); so I might as well go for showing test coverage use in a different language for a change (like Clojure or Ruby). After the fact tests are definitely important too.<p>> That said, I don&#x27;t think many people will watch a code walkthrough, so don&#x27;t expect much fame or uptake from your series.<p>I know about that, that is why I am not only doing screencasts, but additionally, I am generally blogging, speaking at meetups (and hopefully in the future on conferences), simply speak to people and debate with them (I am ENTP after all), pair-program with random people, and I have in mind joining as a teacher/mentor one of the organization we have here in Berlin to teach beginners.<p>> I think unit tests implicitly enforce an API on the code, even when there&#x27;s no need for an API. It&#x27;s a special purpose internal API designed for testing. Because they are internal functions, you should have the freedom to refactor them, but the unit test burden keeps you from doing so.<p>&quot;special purpose internal API designed for testing&quot; is actually a smell to my knowledge. This emerges, when one tries to unit-test something that is not decoupled enough, or when one has too big objects/functions, read: violating one or many points of SOLID. That is why there is such a phrase going around: &quot;Other word for &#x27;testable&#x27; is &#x27;decoupled&#x27;&quot;.<p>I did see this happening a lot of times. Even I had to do such weird test-only APIs myself, when I had less experience. And yes, it was weird and painful to test. Now that I analyze my knowledge: indeed, the problem was is that the object/function under test was initially badly designed. If I were to go back to the past, I would tell myself: &quot;You see here one method. I see here 4 objects.&quot;.<p>Currently, I use that as an indicator - whenever I need to know something &quot;intimate&quot; about function or object, so that I need special API; means, that function or object under test is, most probably, should be split; and dependency injection should be used to combine the parts. This works both in OO and FP world for me: it is just a question of combining independent objects or independent functions together.<p>Now that I think about it, all my objects/functions in the professional code I write tend to be public-API-ish. I never test private methods/functions. But I have to say, that my objects usually have only one or two public methods (and they are extremely small).<p>> You might want to read <a href=""http://www.rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Wa.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Wa...</a>. . There&#x27;s a follow-up as well. He argues that most time should be spent on integration testing, and I agree.<p>Notion of Unit vs Integration goes on as long as I remember. And from one year to another, someone always coins &quot;Unit tests are dead, long live Integration tests&quot;; another year and someone says: &quot;Integration tests are dead, long live Unit tests&quot;. It flips over and over again.<p>What I think, is that both are important. Which is more important, depends on lots of factors.<p>I am biased towards Unit testing, since I like being able to do some actual productive work on the airplane on a low-energy battery in my laptop, if I have to, and it will just simply work, because it is very well-tested. That is why, my code typically has 90-95% of unit tests and 5-10% for everything else.<p>---<p>Thanks for such a conversation, you have really provided a lot of interesting insights for me! That is quite rare to find someone, who would do that.",1454802790

Wrong.  Because even if no white person harbored racist thoughts of any kind, we are still saddled with racist institutions and wealth distribution.  Even if police magically became completely egalitarian, black people would still suffer the brunt of police brutality, because they still live in the poorest areas where there is the most crime.<p>The bottom line is that, if you are a white male (which I am), then you really and truly should be listening and not proclaiming any strong opinion or solution, because privilege is a blind, and so you really are not qualified to have an opinion about what should be done about sexism or racism.  I feel like this is especially onerous for geeks (again, like me) who value their ability to reason, but understand that your (my) feelings being hurt is much less of an indignity than most black people face on a regular basis.

If the child was to provide a net benefit to humankind, she would not abort.<p>Third, your assumption that unborn (and born) children are a burden to society is correct, but that initial investment is small with regards to the average net &quot;benefit&quot; a grown human creates. It must also be noted that the vast majority of humans benefit humankind through their work (although some have greater impact than others).<p>No person can see the future, however, so most utilitarians would never abort their children, as the probability their offspring benefit humanity as a whole is greater than the chance that they destroy value.<p>Frankly, I doubt any woman considers the ethical implications of abortion when they undergo one, and are primarily concerned with family, relationship, and personal problems. If one thinks beyond personal convenience, and look at the bigger picture, abortions are morally unjust from almost every popular ethical system.<p>Think hard about the choice your parents made by not aborting you.

Autodesk is not a sexy company (monopoly or otherwise) but I really wonder whether DWG/AutoCAD&#x27;s key market, architectural drafting (as opposed to architectural drawing) is ever going to be a rewarding activity for anyone.<p>I&#x27;ve got years of diverse experience in the field of architecture and software, and Revit seems like a very clever toy but not a substitute for endless labour over details. Good architects draw every brick (or equivalent), and/or they also work in close experimental collaboration with the people fabricating the building elements. I&#x27;m thinking in the first case of Caruso St. John <a href=""http://www.carusostjohn.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.carusostjohn.com/</a> drawing every brick\nand in the second of a practice like Grimshaw <a href=""http://grimshaw-architects.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grimshaw-architects.com/</a> using lost-wax casting (investment casting) to make components. The trade or craft knowledge involved means there are effective constraints which cannot even be expressed in Revit (individual bricks are not really an option in Revit, and you definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to design a metal casting using  Revit... It&#x27;s an Autocad job, or better, a job for something more expressive like Maya or Mudbox (or whatever it&#x27;s called) or whatever tool suits your aesthetic. You can&#x27;t get to Rodin from Autocad.)",1454801584

There are lots of people who would be better off (using any reasonable definition of better off that you chose) working as an H-1B worker in the US despite all the potential for abuse (real and exaggerated) that the status entails. They&#x27;d be better off because the pay would be higher. They might be better off because they like american culture better than that of their home country. They might be better off because their is greater scope for career advancement. They might be better off because they might learn more from their peers in the US. Etc.<p>2. H-1B workers do have the option of quitting their jobs and going back to their home countries if they decide that the abuse is too much.

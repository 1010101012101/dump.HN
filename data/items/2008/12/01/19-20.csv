Ford had a profitable Q1 this year, and it's last full profitable year was as recently as 2005 (just under 3 years ago).

381997,comment,381803,381803,0,0,gills,,,"Four very different thoughts here...<p>1.There is precedent for criminal convictions of pretexting as part of some larger criminal social engineering act.  Personally, I think bullying is a stretch.  It's a feature of the Internet, and if a person can't shrug off anonymous Internet bullying then that person has deeper psychological problems.<p>2.Should go back and re-examine (and possibly overturn) all criminal cases in which pretexting and/or false identities were used by the authorities?  If there is precedent that this behavior is illegal, then we need to reinforce that law enforcement tactics are not above the law.<p>3.The shell of anonymity is only safe when it is perfect -- leaks create the opportunity for blackmail.  In many situations it is more important that you are not in a position to be blackmailed, than to disclose any 'undesirable' behavior or association.<p>4.How could this case stand on appeal?  Didn't the judge essentially interpret breach of contract into criminal law?  MySpace obviously granted Ms. Drew's account -- her access to the system could not have been ""unauthorized"" as claimed in the wire fraud charge.  Most contracts and TOS have pretty clear terms about what happens when one party breaches, so this should have been a simple case of ""you broke the TOS, we closed your account, as stated in the TOS.""  In my opinion, the more serious crime here is that the judge decided he could usurp the legislature's power and turn random contract text into criminal law.",1228160130

That being said, I'm looking to implement an interpreter (or maybe a vm and compiler) for a functional language to enforce the ideas I've learned in the past few months.<p>In the past, I've written interpreters for a few basic languages and Scheme (not fully r4rs compliant, but close enough to learn what I wanted). Of course, I wrote these in languages that provided garbage collection, and without any type-checking. Basically as AST-walkers.<p>I want to establish more expertise with these topics and create something that I can actually use, maybe even extend, but to build a new language from scratch and make real design decisions isn't in my cards yet.<p>So, the question, does anyone know of language specifications for functional languages that aren't entirely crippled that would be interesting to implement as a learning project?<p>Please don't suggest scheme.

Put a .gitignore file in the root of your project listing globbed filenames for everything you don't want to manage. Run 'git commit' after every sequence of 'git add' or 'git rm' invocations.

446247,comment,445162,446211,0,0,raffi,,,"One of my challenges is educating my market on the differences.<p>1) A word processor provides spellcheck, grammar check, and some text enrichment aka style checking.  My software provides spellcheck, minor grammar things, and very heavy text enrichment.  Desktop software comparable to my text enrichment technology retails for $130.  My spellchecker also detects homophones (where, were, etc.) which the Firefox spellchecker and the Wordpress spellchecker do not do.<p>END USER BENEFIT: checks you don't get in a word processor, improvement over the default spellcheck.<p>2) c+p from a word processor back into Wordpress is cumbersome.  Claiming that all people follow this practice is misguided.  I agree some people do this and others use standalone blog editors.  However I see CMSs bringing in more and more word processor functionality as time goes on.  After all, you are editing and producing content in the CMS, these tools should should be available.<p>END USER BENEFIT: convenience, safety net built into the CMS for those times when writers are too lazy to open a word processor<p>3) my engine makes it easy to add rules to enforce organizational style guidelines in writing.  Imagine you have a corporate blog where many employees are producing content that the public sees.  Most organizations worth their salt have a style guide.  My software makes it easy to enforce style guidelines.  I don't have a rule editor in place for everyone yet but my engine can support this.<p>END USER BENEFIT: centralized control of style guidelines, ability to enforce style guidelines<p>Think beyond Wordpress.  Any web app with TinyMCE can use my service to embed language checking capabilities as shown in that screenshot.<p>(note--even though I'm building writing tools, its 6am, I've been up all night, please forgive my sloppy writing style right now)",1232707837

In fact I will have to hire someone this year and probably use the services of a freelancer.<p>Last year I officially decided to cease actively seeking clients.",1232707242

446240,comment,446143,446143,0,0,sdfx,,,"""how it works"" is a bit convoluted. Perhaps distinguish between advertiser, publisher and job seeker and explain how your service helps them. The design in general is not as clean as it could be, and the font-sizes on the first page seems random. Maybe you could emphasize important parts and leave out less important ones.<p>The links in your widgets seem to be broken ""post a job"" and the image-link end up on the start page, not shure this is intentional.<p>Apart from design, I think the idea is neat. I am not shure how your payout compares to regular advertisement, but the posibility of a large profit might convince a lot of people to put your widgets on their page.",1232706994

446232,comment,445707,446214,0,0,axod,,,"The point is this:<p>If you run into issues, you need to be able to solve them. If the language is well documented, you can use that. If there are tons of books on the language, you can pick up a book.<p>I'd say asking the community is usually a last resort. Ever asked the PHP or Javascript community questions? Most of them have no idea. They'll give you terrible, often incorrect answers. Ever asked the Java community? Most will recommend you use XML to create a FactoryFactoryGenerator pattern on Jetty using enterprise beans. Ask the lisp community? They'll burn your house down for assuming you're worthy of asking them a question.<p>Obviously these are generalizations, and I'm sure there are some great javascript,php,java,lisp etc communities around.<p>Choosing the language based on the community amounts to just following the other sheep, rather than taking an unbiased decision about which language best fits the job required based on factors including libraries available, books, maintainability, ease of hiring people in later etc etc<p>Also I'd say communities like this (Hacker news) are far more valuable than specific language communities.",1232706159

Laws dictating what's legal to sell, at what price, not at all.<p>Laws are far from the only way to restrict what is sold to the public. Large corporations can leverage their market share to shut down competition in other areas. In order to maintain a healthy market place, you have to ensure that a market is not completely controlled by a few large corporations.",1259845192
974240,comment,972047,972968,0,0,dpatru,,,"Detecting an unnatural decrease in the value of currency is not as simple as tracking prices and standard of living. You need to track productivity too.<p>Normally, in an economy that is growing in productivity, your purchasing power should be growing, not merely staying the same. If your productivity increases by 3% per year, then you should be able to buy 3% more goods and services every year (assuming you work the same hours).<p>If the supply of money does not change, then increases in productivity will be reflected in lower prices. If you made 100 widgets last year for $100 ($1/widget), and this year you made 103 widgets because you got better at it (productivity increase), the price of your widgets would be $100/103widgets = $.97/widget if people spent the same amount of money or portion of their income on widgets. Your goods would be cheaper for customers, or, put another way, your customers would be a little richer in widgets. If others in the economy experienced the same productivity growth, you would also be richer. The $100 you made producing widgets would buy you more of other people's goods. Your standard of living depends on your own productivity and everyone else's. If your productivity is average, and the average is growing, then your standard of living should be growing too.<p>Thus, if the money supply were relatively constant as it would be under a gold standard, prices should naturally fall as productivity increases, while wages should be constant (assuming no population change).<p>When the money supply is growing, it is a lot harder to make these calculations and know what your money should be worth. This is an irritation at the personal, consumer level, you don't know exactly how much the government is screwing you, but at the macro level, it causes bubbles. When people don't know the value of money, they spend unwisely, paying too much for a thing. The housing bubble was caused because people thought that money was worth less than it was. (They can be forgiven for this mistake because it was reasonable. If money were worth more, why were the banks selling it so cheaply?) As a result, they overpaid for houses and builders built too many of them. By the time the mistake was discovered, there were too many houses on the market and their prices dropped suddenly.",1259845148
974239,comment,973803,973803,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I don't think there's much in the way of guidelines or advice that would apply to all employers. Although you're probably focused on just getting a job (and understandably frustrated with that at this point), some employers just won't be a good match for you. So, adopt some of the methods that seem like they'd work with the kind of employers that you'd want to work for.<p>As for me: I hired recently for an open-ended contract position through Craigslist. The pay was pretty good, given the area I'm in. However, the vast majority of the applicants couldn't be bothered to tell me anything about themselves. Most of the responses were along the lines of, ""Here's my resume"". That was it, nothing else, and the resume just included their work history.<p>I'd like to know a little bit about the person applying. Just a paragraph would be fine. Don't limit it to your work experience; your hobbies and how you spend your free time tells me a lot about you.<p>Good luck. It's ugly out there right now.",1259844882

Partly this is because most people still have Win XP and when they got those the default (Windows live search) was horrible. There was a reason to switch to Google.<p>These days Bing's results are good enough that most normal people wouldn't bother to change their browser default if it was set to Bing.<p>Thanks to the good publicity it's been getting in the main stream media it looks like a _lot_ of people are going to upgrade to Win 7, including the crowd of late-adopters that stuck with XP.<p>All of these people will get Bing by default with their new install/computer, and a lot of them won't bother to change it.<p>A box you type in to get search results when you open the Internet window?

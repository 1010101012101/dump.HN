My taxes are higher, but my costs are very predictable, and by design cannot ever bankrupt me: I pay a flat 8% of my income to support the national healthcare system. I won't end up with a charge equal to 20% or 50% or 500% of my income in <i>any</i> circumstance, not even if I get cancer or find myself unemployed. So it's guaranteed that I will always be able to pay my healthcare costs without great hardship.<p>I do hope someday to move back to the USA (mix of language / ""feels like home""), and am mildly hopeful that PPACA will make it feasible, by 2014, for an individual to buy private health insurance without worrying about preexisting conditions and rescissions and whatnot. But we'll see. For now, Danish is growing on me. :P<p>Incidentally, this kind of emergency care would be free <i>even for a tourist</i> in Denmark.

If you are already doing all the reference tracking what is wrong with making it explicit and typing the delete?  Good build tools doing the minimal rebuild thing make builds manageable, sure Go's are faster but it wasn't a pain I was feeling, or have lived with so long I forgot.  So for me the differences boil down to type safe generics vs the way interfaces work. Go is a worthwhile experiment(God I hope Google is doing IBM style research on Go's effect on quality, and that they share it) in how to make development better, but I don't currently think I will see enough payoff to justify the effort of switching.

The overt discrimination of the 1950's and 1960's was gone, but indirect forces existed to keep the number of women in the legal field small. Law schools and law firms made determined efforts to increase the representation of women. Fast forward to today, half of all law schools graduates are women. Nearly half of all associates in large law firms are women. At some old-line NYC firms, 20-25% of partners are women. Law schools and law firms no longer make a concerted effort to recruit women, they just happen to end up with roughly evenly distributed classes.<p>It's easy to say that women are just ""less interested"" in CS/Math, but that's a cop-out. One might point out that a job in a large law firm is often boring and exceedingly detail-oriented (it's kind of like debugging code actually). One might point out that such jobs are also guarded by an entrance examination that depends very heavily on formal logic, something women aren't stereotypical good at. Yet, law firms around the country are full of women.<p>The problem is not so much that there are not enough women in CS. It's that 40% of the kids who get SAT Math scores of 700+, and 30% who get a perfect 800, are girls, yet top CS programs, which presumably screen heavily for math aptitude, might have only 5-10% girls. Given that CS is such a great way to a solid middle class income, and so many girls clearly have the aptitude for it, I find it very difficult to chalk up their self-selection out of CS to merely ""interest.""",1346542834

The culture of living within your means and saving for the future basically died before I was born, so the point that this kind of policy punishes responsible citizens who are capable of living frugally, within their means, and saving the future is essentially moot.<p>Sales and income taxes are easy to implement because they're based around money actually changing hands.  Property taxes are easy to implement because the physical thing that's being taxed is clear.  General wealth taxes rely on accounting and valuation of illiquid assets, which is easily subject to gamesmanship.<p>If this was implemented, you'd just cash out your bank account every day, then tell the tax authorities you ""spent"" the money (in reality you keep a suitcase full of large bills under your mattress, but they have no way of knowing that).  As long as you don't make a ton of money, and could conceivably be spending it on living well (vacations, movies, good food, alcohol, flowers for the significant other, etc.), how are they going to prove otherwise?<p>If you have more money, it gets more difficult to use that particular trick, but you'll also have more political power to get loopholes written into the law, and pay accountants to figure out how to make the loopholes work for you.  And it'll also become more worthwhile to go to the trouble of keeping money overseas out of the range of taxation, or set up exotic financial structures like life insurance policies, trusts or derivatives, which don't have a definite value until they become payable.<p>I'm not an accountant, so some of the details might not be one hundred percent right, but it feels like that's a fair first approximation to what would happen.",1346542815

Freedom Freight is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US, without it, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has.  This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry. We are changing that.<p>If you're ready to change the trucking industry, send your resume and GitHub profile to sean@freedomfreightusa.com",1346542044

And I guess we're at an impasse until one of us takes the time to get the raw data. Because I know you're dead wrong, and you know I'm dead wrong.<p>I do know that nearly half the students these days don't need any help AT ALL. And just being able to drop the over $60,000/year to the school alone for four consecutive years would imply ""loaded"" to me, and well, every sane American. And not all the rest of the other half are drowning in student loans - the distribution doesn't break down into ""drowning"" and ""loaded"". Also, keep in mind the ridiculous cost of living in Manhattan. NYU students, relative to the rest of the colleges and universities in America, are rich as shit. Compare NYU to Harvard and say they're broke. Don't compare NYU to nearly any state school and say that.<p>Of course plenty of students get financial aid there. I never said they don't. But do you <i>really</i> think it's more likely that 4 college buddies who can drop everything they're doing with a cool pipe dream idea but no talent (source: the code they themselves produced) - you think those guys were in the bottom quintile that are drowning, not the upper half that can pay full tuition with no assistance? From my view, you're kidding yourself, likely because of the attractiveness of the ""scrappy startup"" image.",1346541939

I'm not a vegetarian, so I'm not saying this on top of some moral high horse, but it's inefficient and the way animals are raised and slaughtered now is insanely cruel.<p>Actually there are places where plants are worse. How do you grow cereals in hot or cold areas or in the mountains? You'll need irrigation for the hot one and harvesting is going to suck in the mountains. There's also the issue of deforestation. Instead it's better to raise animals like chicken, sheep or goats and let them feed with the grass that's available.<p>Regarding efficiency of plants I've heard that hemp (which is much better than soy) is easy to grow, but I'm not sure about this. Maybe someone else has more information about it.",1346540599

His thing was the eternal greatness of Italy, the connection to ancient Roman glory, the new legions of Italy rebuilding the Roman empire, reorienting society on martial and patriotic lines, etc., etc. The collectivism basically stems from that: the Nation above all. To me, that's a very right-wing sort of collectivism, whereas both the left and liberals have more of an internationalist and multicultural orientation.<p>It's true that it's not libertarian (either right-libertarian or left-libertarian). But I don't think it's too alien from cultural conservatism and ""national greatness conservatism"", which also places a high emphasis on patriotism and the nation, and is highly critical of individuals who deviate from what they see as the good of the community (hence the traditional conservative support for censorship of blasphemous, prurient, and seditious literature, as they believe it's the government's job to prevent this kind of deviance).

I'm sure there's a few people outraged that white power apps aren't in the app store.  The key word is ""few"" as in generally, no one gives a fuck.  Nearly every argument slamming Apple over Drones+ seems just as effective when restated for white power political party apps.

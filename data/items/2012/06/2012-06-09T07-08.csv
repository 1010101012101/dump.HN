Or maybe ""animated ho-hum Spielberg"" is more apt.<p>Could be OK to take your kid to, but IMHO even kids (or especially kids) deserve better.<p>And not to be accused that I speak without offering an alternative, I think that something like ""A nightmare before Christmas"" is light years ahead of Pixar's work, in storytelling, artistic vision, and even visually (and I'm not saying that because of its ""dark mood"". Light stories could also be told in a more artistic way than Pixar's).",1339228503

4087554,comment,4087051,4087453,7,0,shenberg,,,"Note: Just to make things clear, I support Apple's decision here.<p>You're ignoring the fact that according to your analogy, our hypothetical KFC is already allowing people to make and sell different sorts of food with KFC branding from within their store (as long as you give them some of the proceeds and pay an annual fee, which was the case). In fact, a lot of people come to KFC precisely because they have an unmatched breadth of delicious and affordable dishes, and many people want to sell their wares at KFC because of their large clientele - KFC has successfully transformed into a food-court.<p>The hero of your post devised a delicious dish that would lose its flavor without the KFC secret sauce, but unfortunately for him, KFC only allows condiment manufacturers to use their secret sauce, and then only after a certification process to make sure they get the unique taste just right. Of course, they could, say, taste the delicious dish, realize that it's providing them with direct revenue, as well as satisfying consumers and increasing the odds they'll return to the food-court and spend more money.<p>Analogies aside, I understand why Apple does these sorts of things - first of all, they want consistency in UX since there really was no certification process. Also, keeping the ecosystem tightly under their control is much easier when you're very consistent about being draconian from the moment the platform was created (you go to the app-store, you play by their rules).<p>As a side-note, I'm surprised that there's so much support for Apple with these sorts of things when 15-20 years ago the same crowd would have been up in arms if Microsoft were to, say, send cease & desists to Samba or Wine (and still is criticizing Microsoft for disallowing other OSes in WinRT ARM devices).",1339228054

I don't mean to profess complete familiarity with the matter here, but it's just one area where Braintree's difficulty is not coupled directly to the amount of FDI.  My naive understanding is that at this time that these kinds of issues (such as enforcement of contracts with small entities) are still somewhat in the wild-west phase in India.<p>But as other posters have noticed, it does look like there is an emphasis on the EU and members of the Commonwealth.

If it's unsatisfactory, don't change the plot directly, but instead manipulate the characters until the black box spits out something interesting.<p>Reflecting on my recent viewing of <i>Snow White and the Huntsman</i>, it makes sense why Charlize Theron's character managed to get so much more developed than the others' - the character-centric story development process naturally produces a wide distribution of character depths.",1339226033

If you REALLY want to do the right thing when it comes to storing passwords, you need to use a hash algo that is computationally hard enough to brute force, it should take at least .5 sec on a good computer to compute. Every couple years, you should add another pass of the algorithm, ie. F(F(X)), to compensate for faster computers. By adding the extra pass, you won't need the original password to generate the new, revised, stronger custom hash algo. If you do this, in 10 years your passwords will still be secured. Also, salt your passwords with each a unique at least 100 random bytes, shouldn't need to be said.",1339225533

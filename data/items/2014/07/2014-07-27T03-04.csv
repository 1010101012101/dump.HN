8091914,comment,8090996,8091383,1,0,kudos200,,,"The way I have heard it described is that governments have a monopoly on the &quot;legitimate use of force.&quot; That is, if someone commits a crime, or doesn&#x27;t pay taxes, or doesn&#x27;t hold up their end of a contract, the government is the only entity allowed to physically (or otherwise) force someone to do something (go to jail, pay a fine, etc.).<p>I like this definition better because it avoids some of the objections people have responded with. 1) it avoids the word &quot;violence&quot; - the use of force does not require violence, and I think most people would hope that governments wouldn&#x27;t use violence in their enforcement of laws (though we know that in practice this is often not the case), though the threat of force is more consistently necessary) and 2) it acknowledges that it&#x27;s not a monopoly on the <i>use</i> of force, as the reality is that many people use force, but on its <i>legitimate</i> use.<p>I know it&#x27;s even called &quot;monopoly on violence&quot; in the wikipedia article, so it&#x27;s not that I think you&#x27;re mistaken, but rather I prefer this definition. The article mentions the term &quot;monopoly on violence&quot; in English is indeed common, but also controversial.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence</a>",1406433487

8091900,comment,8091209,8091715,1,0,hernansartorio,,,"Thanks for your comment.<p>First note that as stated in the About page, this was a personal project. As such I designed it the way I thought was best for my own use, having a free take on what my ideal UX (including shortcuts) and styling would be.<p><i>Marking a todo as done is a two-motion action: hover over the todo, then click the checkmark (assuming you see the checkmark).</i><p>Unless you can move your cursor telepathically I think hovering is a part of the clicking motion. The mark will appear if you hover it from the left, no need to hover the text. Besides all of those actions can and are mostly done with the keyboard.<p><i>The transition to the done section could be smoother as well. I didn&#x27;t actually notice what I&#x27;d clicked for a moment - took a bit of analysis to figure out that I had marked one as complete.</i><p>I do agree that the done transition could be improved.<p><i>I can make blank todos. Maybe someone, somewhere, would like to make blank todos - for the other 99.99% of your users, this is a bug.</i> ... <i>Pressing the left arrow at the beginning of a todo takes me to the previous todo (bug?).</i><p>That&#x27;s intentional. One of my guiding principles when making it was that it should work just as it were a plain text file.<p><i>Also, I can&#x27;t move between the done and not done sections with the arrow keys.</i><p>That one would be a bug indeed.<p><i>The text is difficult to read (which seems important to a text-based todo list).</i><p>On the machines I use it the text is readable and looks better that way, but I agree that the light weight could not be the best for all setups.<p><i>The entire interface is almost invisible.</i><p>Apart from the previous point, another guiding principle was that the main focus of the app is the content –the to-dos–. That&#x27;s why the UI is lighter, and most of it disappears when you don&#x27;t need it, to let you focus on the content.",1406433029

However, on a 10,000 year time span, you cannot assume much. A very strong drum right now could be very weak in 5,000 years. Or, with one strong earthquake 2,000 years from now, it could crush the drums you&#x27;ve buried deep in the desert. As rainfall seems from the surface and into the water table, it will pull the radioactive material with it, then making the water supply unsafe.<p>Yucca Mountain was a popular site for a long time because it&#x27;s a deep salt mine. Salt mines are interesting because it means that it&#x27;s been impossible for water to flow thru them for millennia, which is the time scale you&#x27;re concerned about here. From an engineering stand point, Yucca Mountain was just about the perfect solution, but it got killed politically because being 100 miles away from Las Vegas was &quot;too close&quot; for elected officials to stomach.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_re...</a><p>Although the design questions are fascinating, the bigger issue that we need somewhere to store all of the nuclear waste.

And not even the very latest-gen devices can do it consistently full-screen at 60fps.  iOS displays motion underneath blur effects in very small areas (e.g. a toolbar) on new devices but if you think about it, you never see motion underneath, say, the lock screen.  The reason is that not even the latest iPad Air has the GPU to apply some fullscreen blurs in enough time to meet the draw deadline.<p>This actually surprises a lot of people--I can&#x27;t count the number of designs I&#x27;ve gotten where some designer has made a large blurred UI element and expects something to move underneath it.

The only thing is, they were rational for the time and place they were created in. Many of the rules various religions teach seem nonsensical, backward and barbaric to us today, but if you look at them through the lens of the context in which they were written, there&#x27;s often a kernel of reason in them.<p>Case in point, sodomy and fornication may have been considered wrong because they spread of diseases. Many of the diseases we can treat easily today were probably debilitating and fatal back then, and they imposed a cost that society then could not bear.<p>Another example, adultery: most of the animal kingdom has no concept of marriage, but a desperately poor society may not be able to tolerate any bad blood brewed by adultery. When your primary resources are the productive youth of your society, you&#x27;d prefer them to be united in their toils (be it farming hunting of wars) rather than killing each other over petty jealousies.<p>Some parts of Islam seem overly brutal to us, but (AFAIK) it was forged in a society that mostly lived an unbelievably harsh tribal life in the desert. Consider theft in that context. Even a minor theft could cause somebody to lose their life, and hence thievery in general was deterred with very harsh punishment.<p>Sure, some rules were made purely for the benefit of a select few, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the point that many others were reasonable for their time.<p>The problem with religion is that people still assume these rules as God&#x27;s (with a capital &#x27;G&#x27;) own truth when they no longer make any sense in the modern day.",1406430569

In our experience so far (Indonesia & Africa), it&#x27;s been shocking how affordably we&#x27;re able to operate the system, though there are caveats when it comes to having to work around local standards (to be explained in a moment).<p>In Indonesia, in our first pilot test in 2013, we were actually able to get SIM cards with unlimited data in retail outlets the equivalent of $2.89/month. You can see a tweet from around that time in which we&#x27;re quite pleasantly surprised:\n<a href=""https://twitter.com/RainforestCx/status/342834137163505664"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/RainforestCx/status/342834137163505664</a><p>The caveat in this case was that these plans are pay-as-you-go, which means that credits must be purchased each month, and applied to the number through SMS. Thus, while in the field, we had to extend our API to keep track of credits, interact with the telecom over SMS, and translate keywords in Bahasa Indonesian SMS&#x27;s that were returned. When an account was running low, another device in the forest was instructed to use a top-up code from (provided by the API) to &quot;top-up&quot; the phone with the low-balance. This is obviously a hack to emulate what people do for each other—namely purchase credits and top up each others&#x27; accounts.<p>Going forward, Rainforest Connection will be looking for semi-affordable monthly plans where available, and only performing work-arounds like the one described above when absolutely necessary.<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that each phone is able to hear chainsaw noises up to a kilometer in the distance, meaning that one single phone can &quot;protect&quot; almost 3 square kilometers (one square mile or 300 hectares) of forest. That means that 100 square kilometers can be protected with only 30 devices, which at nearly any GSM data price point is a good value.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to elaborate more if you have more questions.

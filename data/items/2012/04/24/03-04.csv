By this rationale quite a lot of video games are ""bad"" because they don't fit the criteria for a good board game; of course it doesn't make sense to judge them by that rubric.<p>It should be noted that they both we created in a time before video games were widely available, so perhaps they are rather quaint in some respects today, but I think the fact that the skill required is different from that required by most video games today causes them to retain enough novelty to still be entertaining.<p>The author says that without the theme, Operation would be nothing but picking stuff up with tweezers. In fact, that is a game my siblings and I (all firmly in the Nintendo generation) enjoyed very much and  spent many many hours doing (in a version called ""pick up sticks"").",1335239543

Japanese pronunciation is extremely simple: 5 vowel sounds, no dipthongs, and a handful of consonants. The only struggle for me as an English speaker was learning not to blend the sounds together or slur. Otherwise it's a piece of cake.<p>The biggest difficulty in speaking Japanese, after wrapping your head around the grammar, is learning ""The right way"" to say something according to your standing with the person you're talking to.

3882326,comment,3880213,3882175,4,0,varikin,,,"Many providers have customized the OS for the look and feel along with adding their custom apps and settings including locking out tethering. One of the big advantages of 3.0 was it was suppose to provide an easier way to separate out the look and feel out of the OS so the providers didn't need to create a custom OS. This make pushing out updates very difficult.<p>For example, I worked on an app to be included with the device by the OEM. The OEM had roll a custom OS and kernel to handle their hardware and replace/update the mail and calender app because they are very tied to Google by default. We needed hooks into the the mail and calendar app in ways that are not supported by Google so the OEM also had to add those hooks for us. At this point, we were deep into unsupported territory by Google, but supported by the OEM. These things change unexpectedly with minor OS updates from Google which make them brittle to maintain. An update to a newer OS would be a hell of a lot of work.<p>All that said, if we could have based off of 3.0 instead of 2.3, many of these issues would not exist because of some abstraction layers added just for this purpose. I expect 4.0 to make that even nicer.",1335239434

When individuals believe they have the ability to effect change in their own life, they become more able to. This is borne out by statistics and experience.<p>I question, though, whether that spiel is appropriate here. Most people who haven't met success and are stuck in that blaming-external-factors rut don't post on Hacker News.<p>In an abstract sense, a sufficiently motivated person can accomplish nearly anything. But I use the phrase ""sufficiently motivated"" purposefully, because that kind of person bears a resemblance to the fabled compiler. It's true that there are a series of actions that can lead an unprivileged person to whatever level of success you imagine. More than that, such an unprivileged person exists, at least often enough to be relevant. But it passes over key structural issues by pushing all responsibility to the individuals who are stuck in some unhappy situation and ignores the reality that the average person can't be expected to have above-average judgment and motivation.<p>Taking the point to the extreme: Frederick Douglass was born a slave and worked himself up to the point where he was a world renowned intellectual. Diocletian was born a slave but eventually became Emperor of Rome.* Despite those facts, it's not controversial to say that we can't blame slaves for their misfortunes, even though through enough perseverance and skill it was theoretically possible for any slave to end up in a tolerable place.<p>For an individual seeking success, it's best to focus on yourself and self-improvement. But that fact doesn't change the reality that some people have to focus an exceptional (and unrealistic) amount on self-improvement in order to get what comes to other people with little effort.<p>* Interestingly enough, the ancient Romans practiced manumission for their best slaves with some regularity, holding up the freedman as an example of what a slave could achieve if he worked hard enough for his master.",1335238973

The Taiwanese almost completely merge s/sh, z/zh, c/ch and also n/ng in some cases. You cannot distinguish between 4 and 10 without tones here. I have often heard that the Taiwanese rely more on tones, and Beijingers rely more on the actual sounds (as in Western languages).<p>Also, most of the time when people do not understand me, it is precisely because of the tones. I still often encounter situations where a friend will repeat my last sentence character for character, making me think ""that's what I said!!"", but apparently I didn't.<p>Reading is super easy, handwriting is a useless but fun hobby. Pronunciation is super tough.<p>(I am German, though - but if anything, I feel that we have it easier to pronounce Mandarin sounds.)",1335238147

The issue is rarely does the average person look at an important decision with any real amount of thought.  Yes, person.  Not teenager.<p>When I was a teenager (tail-end of dot-com boom) there was this implicit assumption that I was going to go to the best school I could afford and get accepted into -- loans be damned -- and that was it.  That's what friends would tell me, my parents, television, teachers and my guidance counselor.  Everyone simply rolled with it.<p>I didn't.  I got into stellar schools, but I didn't get any full scholarships.  MIT and WPI would've ultimately required a loan large enough to buy the house I grew up in at its current market value.  That alone was enough to scare me shitless.  My sister was at Cornell racking up that kind of debt as it was, but didn't think anything of it.  I sure as hell did.  I looked at my job prospects where I lived.  I looked at salaries.  I thought the evaluation of tech stocks was absolutely ludicrous* and wasn't sustainable.  I went to a state school, paid cash thanks to working nearly full-time, withdrew second semester and planned out my alternate approach.  My parents kicked me out of the house and everyone thought I was an imbecile.<p>They don't now.  However it wasn't fate that got me where I was.  I sit down, think about my situation, and figure out not only what I want to change but how I'm going to go about accomplishing it.  I do it every year.  I do it every time I don't like something with my current situation.  It's not that people are inept.  I'll have friends over that are displeased with X, and I just pelt them with questions.  I ask what they don't like, what they're going to do about it, and then have them prove that plan is feasible to see if it'll float or if it needs revision.  They go home with a plan, and eventually they act on it one way or another and shit gets better.<p>Most people would be a lot better off if they just had someone blow holes in their plans, to ensure they have a decent plan in the first place.<p>-----<p>* <i>And thought my parents' notion of the house doubling in value every seven years until the end of time was nuts since I was 12 (early 90s).

How many .NET shops actually use IronRuby or even F#.<p>Besides, I'm not sure what's so leading edge about bringing Ruby to .NET. Ruby is 10 years old and Java has had an implementation for much longer. I also have no idea what is leading edge about WCF (or WPF for that matter) though I really like the work Glenn Block has done recently for WCF and much of it is arguably very cutting edge REST stuff, so there are certainly exceptions, but they are just that exceptions.<p>If you're point is that MS shops are quick to embrace MS christened technologies, well that is relatively speaking true. However MS is often well behind the technology curve of even the .NET open source community (monorail predates MVC significantly) and generally speaking even further behind the ecosystems outside of .NET.<p>Bottom line, I see no evidence to support a claim that .NET development supports a significant culture of early adopters.",1335237248

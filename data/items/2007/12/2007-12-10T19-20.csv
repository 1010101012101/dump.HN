I've always looked at Django as a great app for what it's designed for, which is basically a CMS for trusted users.  Sure, it can be used to make almost anything, but anytime I move beyond the trusted-user-CMS area, I avoid it.",1197315192

I assumed something like reading from disk or network, and then CPU cycles are usually not the bottleneck. <p>Anyway, no doubt that you can write faster code in C, but I am glad that I did not have to look at pointer arithmetic for the last 8 years. Using your array->struct technique would be a major headache if the struct get's more complex.",1197314454

Like, take two identical companies, but have a CEO run one and a random guy from the street run the other, and show that they both are equally successful?<p>Isn't the typical CEO salary being decided on by the vote of the shareholders? Why would they vote for paying so much, if it wasn't worth it?<p>I remember reading an article by Greenspun who says that the CEOs rip off the shareholders, though. Just not sure how they pull it off.",1197313937

untested, but something like that... There is also object serialization. I never had a use case for what you describe. <p>(format code with 4 leading spaces)",1197313277

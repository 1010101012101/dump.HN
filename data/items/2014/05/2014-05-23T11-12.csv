7788939,comment,7788678,7788678,1,0,sologoub,,,"California is a double-edged sword. I&#x27;ve lived here for over 15 years and it&#x27;s definitely the place I intend on staying for quite a while.<p>If you plan on being near either Bay Area or the greater Los Angeles area, you have to be ready for the housing prices. A good, safe area with good schools will cost you. A short commute on top of that will cost you double.<p>That said, if you do your research, you can find very solid public schools (school districts) and University is doable, unless you go private.<p>As far as neighbors, it&#x27;s a mixed bag - there are plenty of great people and there also many fake, greedy, etc. Just like any big city. Culturally, Americans seem to be more predisposed to welcoming people than not.<p>Back to the finances, with the costs of housing, it&#x27;s not likely that you will be able to be the sole breadwinner. I&#x27;ve been trying to solve this puzzle for a while, but on a single income things just don&#x27;t pencil...<p>Now the upside - California lifestyle is something else. You have all 4 seasons at your disposal with only a drive or a short flight year round. This opens up a lot of possibilities for enjoying nature/sports. If you are more into just quiet enjoyment, the state offers magnificent areas like Big Sur, that are also surrounded by awesome hotels, camping grounds and wine country. California wine is great and very inexpensive.<p>You also have the beach (really cold water though) and great weather most days out of the year.<p>Downside of Los Angeles is traffic and lack of public transit. In SF, you trade public transit for huge cost of living increase.<p>Never having lived in Belgium, I can&#x27;t compare. My only experience has been a very short (6 months) stint in the UK and Moscow. I would not come back to either voluntarily after California.<p>If you are not afraid of a little rain, I would strongly recommend you consider Seattle - reasonable weather (I like rain) and not too much cold, great nature and friendly people (by my standards of visiting and working with a few great folks), no state income tax (CA works out to an extra 10% for me), a lot lower cost of living with similar level of education offered by the local school system.",1400846304

At the (2-day) job interview, people who worked there pointed out that the biggest benefit over Europe was the perceived freedom, the feeling that noone would bother them about their private business (this is probably no longer the case / general feeling today). I found the poverty in urban areas most shocking (loitering people, obvious racial inequality).<p>In the end it boils down to whether having your &quot;dream job&quot; (for me it was game programming) is worth both getting ripped out of your surroundings and coping with lower standards in many areas in the US over Europe (well, depends on whether you live in a poor EU country), as well as other issues like the harsher environment (floods, earthquakes). 50-60 hours was a given in the 90&#x27;s, perhaps it is no longer the case now that Google/FB set the bar higher for job quality.

According to Bloomberg, companies recruit across the poor cities and villages of Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Nepal to staff up the army of workers needed to create components. To accomplish that task, recruiters hire brokers, who charge families high fees — often a year&#x27;s worth of wages, with interest — for the opportunity to work on the supply side.</i><p>><i>Factory workers were reportedly also obliged to surrender their passports to brokers to ensure they paid off their debts. This practice amounts to the very same kind of bonded labor that Apple has tried to combat in its recent supply-chain audits. According to Bloomberg, Flextronics has commissioned an outside group to conduct an investigation into the fees being foisted on recruits. Apple spokesperson Chris Gaither told Bloomberg that the company will ensure that &quot;the right payments have been made.&quot;</i><p>Neither of those is the story I had in mind FWIW.

7788816,comment,7786350,7786350,7,0,datenwolf,,,"If I may speculate about why those ICs were destroyed, then I&#x27;d wager on, that the decision about which ICs to destroy was not made by an engineer, but by some overseeing manager who went through a number of PowerPoint slides (like they were leaked over the past year) and identified those as a threat, because those ICs have been mentioned for being an active part in data exfiltration.<p>Let me explain: What those ICs have in common is, that each of them bases their function on fast switching of voltages:<p>The keyboard controller IC rapidly (at several hundred kHz) switches voltage through the key matrix row-lines (addressing the row) so that on the column lines the voltage is read out and thereby telling if a key is pressed, hence making the connection.<p>The touchpad controller IC does the same, but not for reading out electrical connection made by keys, but the change of capacitance caused by a dielectric (=finger).<p>The voltage inverter IC is switching a voltage to drive an induction coil for a voltage converter.<p>Now the (often unwanted) side effect of switching voltages is, that they create electromagnetic waves, that radiate away. Unless you&#x27;re building a radio transmitter you don&#x27;t want that, as this is then EMI (electromagnetic interference). EMI is a big concern in the design of keyboard, touchpad and voltage conversion controller.<p>But for spooks the EMI caused by regular device operation can be a great covert channel to exfiltrate information. To the unwary it just looks like the regular, random EMI but a spy agency may know how to cleverly use it.<p>Now making use of keyboard row-column switching caused EMI to eavesdrop on user input is by no way something new. This kind of tempest attack is as old as it gets. You can nicely see on an oscilloscope when the controller begins reading out the keypad (there&#x27;s some pause before) and every row switching produces a pulse; if there&#x27;s a key pressed the pulse looks different; also the shape of the pulse depends on the amount of wire closing the circuit, so this gives you the key position on the row and column, thereby telling you which key is pressed. When voting computers were about to introduced in the Netherlands European hackers demonstrated, that the entry system of the machines used could be eavesdropped on by their EMI. Unless you got yourself a super EMI optimized keyboard on your computer, you&#x27;re likely giving away your inputs by EMI.<p>The touchpanel controller is similar.<p>Now the inverter controller is interesting, because those normally drive a display&#x27;s backlight, which is more or less independent from the data displayed on the display. But then the display brightness can be controlled by software! So by having a spy program run on the computer that modulates the display brightness with some data you want to exfiltrate you can make use of that channel. However the bitrate will not be very high; if I had to make an educated guess, I&#x27;d say about 100 Baud to 1 kBaud.<p>Anyway I think those techniques may have been presented or documented somewhere and a person without the technical understanding at GCHQ command thought those particular controllers would maybe hold some secrets or are something special, while in fact the really interesting stuff happened somewhere else. It&#x27;s not even clear that the laptop computer had display modulating spyware installed. But that&#x27;s what I was looking for on suspect computers first, because the keyboard and touch controllers are boring and their principal vulnerability to eavesdropping by EMI emission is well known.",1400844144

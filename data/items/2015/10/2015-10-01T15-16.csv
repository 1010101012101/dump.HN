If I understand bugmen0t correctly, in the attack outlined, the file &quot;evil.js&quot; size (and hash and contents) are completely controlled by the attacker. If you did need to specify size, the attack would simply change to:<p>3. the XSS attack is loading <script src=www.victim.com/evil.js hash=foo size=123><p>> <i>If you include that, my understanding is that crafting a hash collision is into the realms of impossibility.</i><p>Crafting a hash collision is <i>already</i> in the realm of impossibility. (They&#x27;re using cryptographic hashes: if you can make SHA256 collide, we have bigger problems.) The attack here isn&#x27;t that you&#x27;re getting the wrong file, it&#x27;s that you&#x27;re getting a file the webserver does not have, at all. Step 4 is where we go wrong: we load the file from cache, while we <i>should</i> instead request it from the server, which will 404 the request because it does not have the file.<p>(And it&#x27;s JS: even <i>if</i> size did matter, you can just add spaces to the end…)",1443715196

10312093,comment,10310353,10310353,0,0,derekp7,,,"Just out of curiosity, does anyone have a link to an example breakdown of the costs per student in a typical university?<p>A full course load is about 12 hours total spent in class per week, for 16 weeks.  Let&#x27;s bump this number up to 20 hours, to account for overhead (homework grading, office hours, course design, etc).  And given a class size of 25 students, that means 1 instructor can handle 50 full time students.  If that instructor gets paid 100K a year, that works out to be 2K of instructor time per student.  So what other overhead is involved that brings the cost of college up to 20 - 50K per year?  You have the building, administration, potentially lab equipment, and teaching supplies (chalk/markers/copy paper/etc).  But I still can&#x27;t see that bumping the price up that much.  Is the per-student share of the building cost really that high?  Or are there 10 administrative staff for every one instructor?",1443715165

10312082,comment,10311156,10311156,0,0,Symmetry,,,"Kessler Syndrome is a serious potential problem and it&#x27;s certainly one people should be worrying about but it&#x27;s mostly something that&#x27;s only a problem for LEO where you have lots of things in a relatively small volume going very fast in different directions.<p>Further out in MEO where GPS satellites are there&#x27;s a much greater volume, fewer satellites, and the satellites aren&#x27;t moving as fast.  There&#x27;s no way Kessler Syndrome is going to start there.  You do have a bunch of Russian satellites that loop in fast and close by the South Pole then go high and slow over the North, letting them spend most of their time being visible from Russia.  Debris from from a cascade could kill one of those, which would cause debris that would kill some but not all of the GPS sats.  It would be a relatively slow process compared to what would go on in LEO, though.<p>Satellites in GEO won&#x27;t need to worry about Kessler at all.  They&#x27;re all in equatorial orbits, traveling in the same direction at the same speed.  If one explodes its debris will only hit other satellites with the explosion velocity, not orbital velocity.  So those should survive Kessler Syndrome fine, though you can&#x27;t put any new ones there.<p>Also, Kessler Syndrom isn&#x27;t forever.  Satellites in LEO need to boost every once in a while to overcome atmospheric drag.  As things get broken up their surface area to volume ratio increases and the fall out of orbit faster.  Air density falls of exponentially with height so the lower reaches of orbit will become safe first.  The inner reaches of LEO might be clear quickly but I have no idea how long it would be before orbit was totally clear.",1443715100

The first EMV transaction I performed outside of Walmart was at my local liquor store on a stand-beside terminal (not directly integrated with the point of sale).<p>I work in this space, and while both the software and hardware have been ready for some time, retailers are just really slow to change.  When you&#x27;re talking about potentially hundreds to thousands of new card readers at nearly $1k each, followed by many hours of testing new software versions, piloting and rolling it out, etc., it is a significant investment for them to add support for EMV.  That said, it&#x27;s not like this was on short notice.  They&#x27;ve had plenty of time (and incentive) to get this done.",1443714089

Your browser running secure.com would reject the b0af301 script.<p>(Something I personally would like would be for for orgs like EFF.org to post known-good hashes, so I can always add the EFF hashes to my site&#x27;s CSP whitelist, and have a warm-and-fuzzy feeling.)",1443713968

As part of the &quot;Signposting the Scholarly Web&quot; work, we looked into this issue and thought that using a &quot;canonical&quot; link from the landing page URL to the DOI URL would be a good step.<p>It needs to be understood that &quot;canonical&quot; was really introduced in the context of search engine optimization and is supported by web search engines. In essence, if a landing page would have a &quot;canonical&quot; link to the DOI RL, the content of the landing page would be indexed under the DOI URL.<p>For browsers, the desired behavior would be to bookmark a page that has a &quot;canonical&quot; link under the canonical URL instead of the page&#x27;s URL. At this time, to the best of my knowledge, this is not supported by browsers. However, it seems to me that it should not be impossible to achieve this, if, for example, the Persistent Identifier community (DOI, handle, PURL, ark, ...) would lobby for it. Alternatively, one could write an RFC and define another link relation type specifically for this relation type between landing page and persistent identifier. And lobby browser manufacturers to implement the &quot;right&quot; bookmarking behavior for it. But, the difference between &quot;canonical&quot; and this special-purpose relation type might be too subtle to make it through IANA registration scrutiny.",1443713681

Most instances are easily solved by existing algorithms, but some instances are not.<p>Ok, if you show me an instance an actual person has, I would consider it a &#x27;practical problem&#x27;, now, &#x27;practical instance&#x27;.<p>Given an instance, you could compute &quot;benefit&quot; as such: (resources_used_by_using_solution_provided_by_&quot;existing_algorithms&quot;) - (resources_used_by_using_solution_provided_by_sub_NP_space_time_solver|presumably_optimal)<p>Note, I&#x27;m not (directly) talking about the resources used for the computation, but rather the resources used in the real-world by taking advice from an algorithm. For instance, in the UPS example, fuel and labor costs depend on the exact route decided by UPS&#x27;s logistics algorithm. Most likely that route is not &#x27;optimal&#x27;, but may be pretty close (not many resources would be saved by using the optimal route over whatever other route UPS ends up driving).<p>>What would you do with it?<p>I would certainly look at it and at least make a cursory attempt at solving it. However, the reason I originally asked the question was so that I could have a legitimate problem (with instances) to give to someone who claims a P=NP proof in addition to an algorithm.<p>He can solve most random subset sum problems, of the kind I gave you, with decently sized sets (thousands of elements) and randomly selected targets very quickly. However, I think that random subset sum problems might be pretty easy. Further, I&#x27;m not sure of the precise way to measure the complexity of the algorithm when just given a list of integers in ASCII. I assume you really need to analyze things at the bit level, instead of just the number of ASCII characters.<p>But, assuming P=NP and we have a runnable algorithm (which I don&#x27;t necessary believe, but do allow for), I am interested in finding and solving the problems that would have the largest benefit (as previously defined).<p>Assume you can only solve a single instance at a time, what order do you solve them in?<p>Edit about terminology:<p>Like I said, if you have a standard glossary I could probably wield it effectively in our conversation.<p>However, I typically find that there are few globally standard terms. Instead, each sub-culture seems to define their own very technical definitions of words. Sometimes these are similar to other culture&#x27;s definitions, sometimes not.<p>Selecting which sub-cultures to borrow from is tricky and there is certainly no right answer, but I also see that there is tremendous value in having similar definitions.<p>If you do have a good reference, I&#x27;d appreciate it.",1443713661

Try to try it for yourself.<p>The recommendation of using red light to preserve night vision is mostly a myth. While at the same absolute brightness red light indeed reduces night vission less, you need a much more powerful red light source to reach the same subjective brightness, which cancels out any potential benefit.<p>The same is true for outdoor lighting. The eye is the most sensitive to ~505 nm blue-green light, so you need much dimmer white/blue-green light sources to reach equal visibility with orange ones, which both saves energy and reduces light polution. White LEDs are only a problem where no compensation was made for their higher subjective brightness. When LED lighting is used correctly, it&#x27;s quite pleasant and it looks kind of like unusually good moonlight.<p>No you can&#x27;t use dim orange/&quot;warm white&quot; lights, because human vision can&#x27;t night adapt to them, it needs the short wavelenghts for that which are missing from these light sources.<p>It&#x27;s not true that high color temperature LEDs are wasteful, on the contrary, low color temperature LEDs are inherently less efficient. Warm white will always be less efficient than more bluish light and there is nothing that can be done about that, since it&#x27;s a feature of our vision.<p>And what I meant in my previous comment is that it&#x27;s likely that the exposure to unnaturally low color temperature light is what causes nearsightedness: <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/the-myopia-boom-1.17120"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/the-myopia-boom-1.17120</a> and <a href=""http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2127682"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2127682</a>",1443713364

It depends on a lot of things. Sure, there&#x27;s a place in the world for PHP pages that take two or three full seconds to render, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because they&#x27;re doing something useful and don&#x27;t get hit a thousand times per second. There&#x27;s also a place for things that render in under a millisecond because they&#x27;re getting hit at an incredible rate, and if they also have some sort of interdependencies then Rust can make a lot of sense.<p>Plus as I&#x27;ve said before, the whole &quot;you&#x27;re stuck in IO anyhow so who cares how fast the render code runs&quot; dogma has sometimes gone too far. (I know you didn&#x27;t say anything about that, but I&#x27;m guessing based on experience it&#x27;s what lies behind your point.)

Recently, someone came to me with the idea of a product that I might be interested in building. What we do best is build products.<p>This person doesn&#x27;t have the money to pay for this product to be built and even if they did, that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m interested in (as in, I don&#x27;t want to be an agency, I want to own part of the product). I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out how this could work in terms of equity and amount of work. Does anybody have an example of such a thing?<p>For example, for our own products, sometimes we reach a level in which it&#x27;s feature complete and we stop adding features while we work on the marketing and if we don&#x27;t increase revenue for it, we don&#x27;t pour more development resources into it. When it happens with a third party, I can see this being problematic.<p>Sometimes one product requires urgent attention and resources are taken from another product to do so. When we own all our products it&#x27;s a simple prioritization problem of what is more urgent, which product is bigger, etc. When one of the products is partially owned by somebody else, the equation would also include whether we are doing our part of the deal.<p>Whenever I push this model forward, I see up writing long detailed specs (that are hard to change on the fly) and committing a predefined amount of time to each project that will require time tracking. One of the reasons why I co-founded a startup instead of working on an agency is because I don&#x27;t like either of those things and I believe they hamper coding productivity, so I don&#x27;t want to push these things to my developers, that joined this company with the expectation of a different workplace too.",1443713200

10311708,comment,10310230,10311001,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"I agree, there&#x27;s a fair bit. It&#x27;s tricky to find numbers, and it&#x27;s definitely really in flux, offices that speak English today would sometimes have been unthinkable 10 years ago. Fun story, worked at foreign affairs as an intern some years ago and due to the nature of our work being international and so much of our communication with partners etc, our papers, presentations and research etc was English, it was proposed to start having meetings in English, too, so we wouldn&#x27;t have to translate any English documentation we might be discussing. Again, foreign affairs, a job you can only get if you&#x27;re a national of the country, that requires you to sign documents you won&#x27;t disclose state secrets etc, obviously it&#x27;s by its nature a pretty chauvinistic affair so I thought that was funny. Another interesting remark is that they used to require you to speak French, too, to work at foreign affairs, for decades and decades this was THE diplomatic language of the world and you couldn&#x27;t get a job unless you spoke it fluently. (same thing for the UN for example, Ban Ki Moon had to take intense classes in French to get his job although somehow he got a pass as his French is beyond horrible), but at foreign affairs they also let go of this French requirement. It&#x27;s still beneficial but it&#x27;s no longer mandatory. How times have changed.<p>Finally a fun anecdote about the role of French in history and some thoughts about where language might go in the future, I remember when reading war and peace where the Russian aristocracy&#x27;s command of French is much better than their Russian, and as Russia is invaded by France, they scramble for tutors to improve their Russian lest they&#x27;re deemed &#x27;too French&#x27; in a Russia at war with France. It reminds me of arab family members who went to French private schools in arab speaking countries, and their arabic is pretty bad because of it. It&#x27;s kind of funny in that in history the elite were often relatively multilingual and internationally oriented, but the rest (the vast majority) was not, and instead spoke the local language (or even dialect) and was locally oriented. Each spoke the language of their network, one which was relatively large, the other which was local with most people never traveling 50km from where they were born, or communicate with people outside that radius. But with the advent of modern tech, we&#x27;re seeing dirt cheap long-distance communication networks, relatively cheap transport etc etc, you know the story... and I wonder if that will create language homogeneity in the world on a scale we&#x27;ve never seen before, when the majority of the population starts speaking a more international standard language (like say French was for some centuries the standard international language of elites, only now it&#x27;s not confined to the top 1%). With the above anecdotes I can hardly imagine we won&#x27;t all be speaking English/Spanish/Chinese/Arabic/Hindi as our first language next century, and everything else as our second, just like the Russian elite spoke French first, Russian second, and some of my family French first, Arabic second, and I in my professional life (and increasingly personal) English first, Dutch second. It&#x27;d take some major conflict to flare up nationalist notions to preserve the hundreds of languages different people now have as their &#x27;first&#x27; language, like it took the invasion of Russia for the Russian elite to denounce French culture and fashion and choose Russian first.<p>Anyway I definitely share your experiences back home in the Netherlands but then I did always pick international jobs. But more generally speaking, there&#x27;s tons of jobs where I&#x27;d absolutely have to speak Dutch, virtually anything client-facing, most B2B comms is Dutch still and I&#x27;ve read a few times on Glassdoor of employees complaining that despite the company being internationally-oriented, Dutch is still used a fair bit and they feel left out of conversations (often non-work convos). That doesn&#x27;t say much about what you can get away with, if you wanted you could probably speak to 95% of customers, partners and colleagues in English just fine, but it says something about what is expected and happens in practice, which is surprising as the Dutch do speak a ton of English and they even enjoy it (to the extent a big complaint from foreigners is that they can&#x27;t practice Dutch because if you try a sentence, the Dutch person will switch to English. But that&#x27;s 1 on 1, if you&#x27;re the only foreigner in a bar or workplace with 6 Dutch friends/colleagues, Dutch is still very much the norm and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s still a requirement for most jobs. In looking abroad for jobs in say Spain I still feel the jobs I can pick where English is good enough are pretty narrow and I really only have the option of a narrow selection of jobs, same for France, Germany slightly less so but there too. And the further out you go, Italy for example, it gets worse. In London I can land any job - except translation or teaching jobs where native proficiency is really crucial - the difference is pretty big.",1443712538

Wanting to &quot;not to fuck up&quot; or to &quot;make mommy and daddy proud of you&quot; or just to &quot;work on a great product&quot; might be fine but in a lot of cases it ends up in burn-out. If you are tough enough and want to make a kill (saving up the fuck-you-money within 5 years and doing after that whatever you want) than set your price and go for it. If you are not tough enough but you want to make a kill than find the best people of the industy, learn from them, set your price and go for it. Otherwise staying next to your family and friends might be the best option on the long run.",1443712279

At those hardnesses it tends to be more brittle, though, unlike titanium.<p>The breakthrough here isn&#x27;t that they can make it strong, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;ve made it both strong and tough.

  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great
  opportunity to learn. In the past two years, I&#x27;ve worked with Python,
  Objective-C, Swift, Backbone.js + PhoneGap, Angular + CoffeeScript,
  Node.js, and Ruby/Rails.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
  activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
  rare by design. Last year I worked an average of 40.408 hours per week.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
  sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
  with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience building
  software with a variety of tools and technologies.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
  afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile tech.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

There is an option to get equity for top performers.<p>You can find out what we are about by watching this video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzi2hmsEH6k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzi2hmsEH6k</a>

The only required environment variable tweak is the PATH one above.<p>(In a corner case, where you have modified your MANPATH in your bash profile, which almost no one does, you may want to add another variable for man pages, but normally this works fine out of the box without an env var. The other optional env var is for versions of OS X older than 10.5.)<p>(FWIW, I&#x27;ve had the opposite experience — MacPorts rarely fails, every time I need to switch to Homebrew, several times now, I get a fail right out of the gate with whatever thing wasn&#x27;t available or not working on MacPorts.)",1443711686

I have a well-compensated job in a moderate cost of living area.  I have tried hard to live thrifty and to save money, but my obligations always seem to scale with income.  From shifts in tax burden after marriage & children (AMT anyone?), unexpected health expenses, to rate increases for daycare that scale with income, I have never received a raise that resulted in a net increase in my income.  I have a positive net worth at this point (barely), but I still live paycheck-to-paycheck.<p>I marvel at and envy the kind of financial independence that would allow someone to quit a job on the spot.  For as long as I&#x27;ve been an adult, I&#x27;ve had expenses (student loan payments, bills & utilities, housing, etc.) that far exceed my ability to pay without a regular stream of income.  And my obligations have only increased over time as I built a family.<p>><i>Some people have good jobs and save money.</i><p>In my experience that isn&#x27;t enough.  You also need good luck to have good health - a few trips to the hospital can empty a savings account (at least in the US).  You also need to live in an area where your skills are not just valuable, but where there is a competitive market for them.  I have a number of fairly unique, highly-technical skills -- but they are only valuable to a few employers, and they are located in distinct, remote locations (so there is a high opportunity cost to move between them, and few openings).  It also helps to have the good fortune of manageable expenses.  In my experience, student loan debt is an anchor on young folks because it drains the very savings that would grant the financial freedom that would let them shop for the best job opportunities.<p>I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone their success, but I often wonder how everyone else manages to get by at <i>all</i>, let alone so spectacularly as this.",1443711670

I didn&#x27;t just happen to have low expenses, I&#x27;ve been actively lowering them as much as I can! And you have to make some sacrifices to reach a 60% savings rate, but you also realize how much of this middle-class lifestyle doesn&#x27;t actually make you happier. Why do you spend $1500 on food every month for one person for example?! That&#x27;s insane. My expense is too high for my taste even though I bring lunch to work and rarely eat out, but that&#x27;s because groceries in this country are more as expensive than in the US. Eating out costs twice as much as the US. Also why is your housing 3 times mine? If you live with an SO for example you should be able to find something cheaper than $3000. Again, in SF that might be a sacrifice but you have to do something to get ahead.<p>I recommend reading this: <a href=""http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-...</a>",1443711667

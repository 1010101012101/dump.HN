Get Firebug and inspect the code of sites you like. Start building something with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Constantly improve what you're working on, and don't be afraid to ditch what you've got and start something new.<p>Focus on JavaScript. Watch the SICP lectures, read Doug Crockford, Raganwald, John Resig, and pg's Arc source. Learn the ins and outs of emacs, vim, TextMate, or Eclipse. Play with Lisp, Python, Ruby, and Io and read others' code in those languages, then apply what you like to your style of writing JavaScript. Try out the major JS frameworks (jQuery, Prototype, MochiKit) and settle on one of them. Then rig up a server-side JavaScript solution (Jaxer, Helma). Pick an interesting domain and learn about it until you find an overlooked problem you can solve, then capitalize on it.",1206842176
149805,comment,149708,149708,0,0,cratuki,,,"""is a society that sends so many of its brightest college graduates into a capital markets monkey pit maximizing welfare?""<p>It's not ""Society"" that is sending people into jobs in banks, it's individuals making individual decisions to accept individual contracts. That's their right, as it should be and there is no act of theft involved.<p>I don't understand why this chap feels that he should object to that. Nobody's forcing him to do it.<p>The paragraph that begins ""It helps that investment banking has a low barrier to entry"" doesn't make a point, nor does the one following.",1206841994

Easy to learn because it intentionally left out most of the boiler-plate fluff from other languages and lets you just express your solution in a direct, concise fashion.<p>If you get to the point where you need to crunch large number sets, check out scipy and numpy (just google).  Takes a slight effort to set up initially, but then allows you to quickly process lots of numbers.  Linear algebra, optimization, etc.",1206841322

149798,comment,149413,149520,0,0,sfg,,,"The fact you will not use the word due to shame makes me think of Gresham's law which states: ""Money overvalued by the State will drive money undervalued by the State out of circulation."",(from Wikipedia). In this case the bad association the word brings pushes its use beyond the comfort zone of those whose intentions are good.<p>Also, the positive image of good hackers is no doubt appealing to the more nefarious computer users and so only increases there desire to use the label. Combine these pressures with the fact that the negative version has already captured the popular mind and it would seem you might be right that the battle is lost.",1206839941
149797,comment,149708,149708,0,0,startingup,,,"Let's remember that this is not ""capitalism"" in a classical sense. Federal Reserve policies have created ""financialism"" where leveraged speculation has been exceedingly profitable. The <i>typical</i> leverage of a hedge-fund is 5-to-1, even 10-to-1. Meriwether of LTCM fame ran a ""conservative"" fund this time with 14-to-1 leverage.<p>That kind of leverage is the <i>direct</i> outcome of the 1% interest rates the Fed ran for a while (banks borrowed at 1%, lent to the hedgies at 4-5%, pocketing a nice spread, and the hedgies used that cheap money to run their own leveraged speculation ...) They get 20% of the upside if they win, and get to walk away if they lose.<p>The net result is a <i>transfer</i> of wealth from productive classes of society towards speculative classes. This is what <i>primarily</i> caused the heightened inequality we witnessed in the last several years. I say all this as an entrepreneur with a libertarian bent.<p>From an individual point of view, it is perfectly rational to speculate this way. It is the Fed policy that created the incentives to speculate.<p>My point is that Wall Street riches have not been fairly earned in a capitalistic marketplace, but in an artificial environment fostered by the Fed.",1206839907

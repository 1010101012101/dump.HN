Getting a job that paid well and living on it convinced me that paying taxes really wasn&#x27;t that bad and made me more liberal.  Then I worked for the government for a while and found that a lot of what people complain about with regards to how the government spends money weren&#x27;t just true.  Nowadays I&#x27;m ok with taxes, but I&#x27;d rather the government get things done by just mailing checks to people, which is simple and hard to mess up.",1394125183

The values in this data <i>never</i> change. That is, if I&#x27;m maintaining a store of the U.S. Congress vote database, all votes (in the past) are inextricably and forever tied to a legislator&#x27;s ID.<p>2. The seed data is so large that loading by ActiveRecord is too slow and needs to be done either by plain SQL import or activerecord-import.<p>3. The dataset should, when possible, imply its own opinion on conventions...so the Congressmebmer table will always be &quot;congressmembers&quot; and Vote will always be in &quot;votes&quot; and the relations and their keys will have the same convention in any app that uses this data. Of course, a particular app may choose to rename things, but they can do that after the seeding process.<p>4. For a situation like the above, it&#x27;s likely that a Rails Engine has been made, i.e. with all the domain-specific logic.<p>For smaller datasets, say, a list of the U.S. states and their abbreviations...storing them as plain seed files should suffice.<p>So anyway, those are my past practices. I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re best, though, and am always looking for better ways to organize data between apps.",1394125116

Basically, many of these services are founded the same way Amazon was founded - completely unsustainable and then hoping something magic happens to make it sustainable later.  Amazon wouldn&#x27;t have survived without the dotcom scene going crazy and they barely got through to the other side.  The music services exist by seeking to convince end users that they are entitled to &quot;mostly free&quot; music, and they only reason they can supply that service is with debt funding.  Their hopes is that the appetite they instill in the end user will give the business enough support to argue favorable licensing terms from labels and the government.<p>So when that happens, the party that hurts is the songwriter.  You already have way too many people believing the canard that an indie songwriter should only expect to make money through touring and merchandise, and never from their recording efforts.  That opinion is self-serving and pushed by those services &quot;use your songs as a marketing expense!&quot; when it is actually supposed to be the musician&#x27;s livelihood.<p>So what happens when a musician gets less and less likelihood of getting any kind of financial remuneration from their actual songwriting?  It&#x27;s a disincentive to focusing on original craftsmanship, and an incentive to focus on churning out greater volumes of homogenous crap in an effort to capture a very tiny piece of a very large homogenous pie.<p>The end result from the perspective of the listener is that they never experience the counterfactual; they never know what they&#x27;re missing.  Sure, you might be enjoying that latest &quot;indie&quot; piece that is really just a max martin form with a decemberists diphthong singing tone combined with a couple of dubstep beats, but is that <i>really</i> original?",1394124687

That way, you can easily test a bit of functionality without having to instantiate the universe.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve also seen it used overly invasively -- that is, the test writer uses it to verify the status of some object internal to the class under test, like your example above. As you note, it creates an incredibly tight coupling between the test and the method being tested.<p>In general, I think that this sort of thing is correlated with classes that are highly stateful. If, for example, your class is full of void methods that modify class members, then you may have no other option than inspecting the internals of the class in order to test its functionality. OTOH, if you can manage to write things in a more functional, less state-heavy manner, then you need less of this sort of introspection.",1394124654

Which is an OK win I guess, and having it separated out by environment (implicitly mentioned in the article) is nice.. but I don&#x27;t see how much of a win this is over instantiating fixtures or FactoryGirl.create in your seeds.rb file.<p>Yes, there are tons of problems with using db/seeds.rb for anything serious. I&#x27;m not sure that Sprig will handle my issues much better than I currently do myself.<p>For the record, my desired behaviors for a seed data solution are:<p>1. environmental separation (which Sprig has). Developers have different needs for seed data as QA does, as does the staging server, as does production. Developers want an easy default dev@myco.com user with a simple password, but you don&#x27;t want that in production.<p>2. If I rerun my seed solution (perhaps because I added some more seed data) it shouldn&#x27;t duplicate records (or throw errors because it&#x27;s trying to create the second user with the same email address)<p>3. Handle bootstrap data I need in my app (example: I want a list of US states, and every environment should get this. To reiterate my second point, I should be able to add to this bootstrap data without getting two copies of &quot;California&quot; in my US state list).<p>It&#x27;s sad that no real solution exists to handle all three of these needs. Some projects I&#x27;ve been on have gotten this close, but that was years ago and things have changed.<p>(If Sprig does have these things, then that&#x27;s the selling point, not seed data as fixtures which the article emphasized)<p>I&#x27;m also not sure about using fixture like things in Sprig. I give it 6 months before most users remember why many people in the Rails community moved to a Factory pattern for (test) data construction long ago.<p>However, I am happy that a relatively well known Rails consultancy is released 1.0 of a seed gem.

You&#x27;ve just confused a couple of different ideas.<p>First off, cognitive dissonance does not explain any behavior patterns other than those prompted by feeling distressed. If these people were exhibiting symptoms of depression, distress, confusion, etc, or were making their decisions under duress of emotion, you could classify it as cognitive dissonance. But the examples given don&#x27;t paint the people as particularly distressed.<p>Doublethink is actually almost the opposite of cognitive dissonance, and is the more correct term for the behavior mentioned. Doublethink is when there is absolutely no conflict in the mind about the two conflicting ideas being held at the same time.<p>Denial is also a different idea, and probably not completely out of context for the individual&#x27;s reasoning, but does not describe the behavior. Denial is when someone finds an idea so difficult to accept that they reject it in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. In this case the person&#x27;s opinion might actually be weighed on various information that seems credible, and so denial might not be a factor at all.<p>The reason I chose &#x27;hypocrisy&#x27; to define this behavior is because it requires an act that is in direct opposition to the values one espouses. In this sense the major difference is that you don&#x27;t have to hold two opposing views in your head (whether under distress - cognitive dissonance - or not - doublethink). You simply have to say you believe one thing, and do an act which is directly in opposition to that belief.<p>You seem to be conflating all these different concepts into one giant over-reaching idea. This is probably not a good thing to do throughout life, not only because you&#x27;re failing to communicate properly by misusing words, but you&#x27;re actually simplifying a set of complex behaviors into one single idea to make it easier to comprehend.

The examples you gave assume that everything can be done in the same process, which isn&#x27;t always possible. (Eg, a network-based service which uses dedicated GPU hardware for performance reasons, which is too expensive to duplicate for each machine.)<p>The recovery method will be specific to the remote resource. Eg, if it&#x27;s often congestion related then a retry with an exponential delay might work. A circuit breaker is just one of many possible fault detection and recovery modes. What language has built-in support for all of them?<p>Also, I&#x27;ve used this idiom in a different context. Some of my code parses a file containing multiple records, one per line. Some of the records are unparseable, for rare but valid reasons I won&#x27;t get into. The proper action in that case is to report the problem, skip the record, and go on to the next.<p>But sometimes people use the wrong format entirely. If (say) 95 of the first 100 records are invalid, then it&#x27;s very likely that the wrong file was passed as input. In that case, the &quot;circuit breaker&quot; should trip, rather than incorrectly trying to parse the rest of the file, which might have occasional &quot;valid&quot; records. My implementation has a low-level reader, plus an intermediate circuit breaker to add the specific failure policy.<p>Since your suggested solution doesn&#x27;t seem to match the problem, and because the referenced idiom applies to more than concurrency, I respectfully disagree with your assessment.",1394123417

I have written a giant, well-organized framework which is used by several of my web apps. I don&#x27;t even have integration tests at this point. My apps are my integration tests.<p>Whenever I make a change, I am very careful to reason about what it affects and then proceed to test it manually across the apps. Still, bugs crop up an alarmingly large fraction of the time - probably 0.25%.<p>For any team, I wish we would do TDD. It&#x27;s as simple as this: you want an automated system that will signal an alarm, just like a compiler. This is especially useful for weakly typed and duck typed languages.<p>Right now, we do have a system but it&#x27;s not automated. It&#x27;s better than nothing - having many clients of an API who use it heavily allows us to make sure we didn&#x27;t break anything significant.<p>However, at this point, I would go for API Unit Testing first. Meaning - every function exposed by the API should have unit tests matching the documentation. You can document internal functions later, but start with the most outward facing ones.<p>There is a second consideration: VERSIONING<p>As for us, we have a system where code that potentially breaks existing API contracts is strictly kept in a branch. This branch is then imported by all stakeholders and tested. Once they sign off that their clients are compatible, it is merged into the mainline with a version number and a notice of breaking changes. Everyone pulling has to read the breaking changes before updating. If they aren&#x27;t ready to deal with those changes, they have to clone their own repo of the framework and cherry-pick commits until they ARE ready.<p>On the good side, our installer automates all this. The framework and plugins keep track of version numbers for the db schemas, apis, everything, and signal when something is out of date.<p>Automated systems are better than blaming humans. They are worth up to 50% extra time of the project.",1394122652

7354538,comment,7353767,7354304,23,0,PaulHoule,,,"I&#x27;ve had two experiences with unit testing recently that have made me a believer.<p>One of them was that I was working on a team where a programmer quit and I had to get a very complex codebase ready for production.  The last programmer was terrible,  the kind of guy who had trouble making primary keys that were unique,  where any code that could possibly have a race condition did,  and so forth.  The code had unit tests,  however,  and that made it salvagable,  and eventually I got the system to a place where it worked correctly and the customers loved it.<p>In nine months of effort on this,  I ran into one refactoring where it felt the unit tests were a burden,  and  that involved about a day of work rewriting the tests.  Unit tests are more likely to be a problem,  however,  when they add to the time of the build process.  For instance,  I wrote something in JUnit that hammered part of the system for race conditions,  and this was key to fixing races in that part of the system.  It fired off a thousand threads and took two minutes to run,  and adding two minutes to your build is a BIG PROBLEM,  particularly if anybody who wants to add two minutes to your build can do so and if anybody who wants to remove two minutes from the build is called &quot;a complainer&quot; and &quot;not a team player&quot;.  Overall the CPU time it takes to run is more likely to be a problem than the developer time it takes to maintain them.<p>As for Mockito I have found it is a great help for writing Map/Reduce jobs.  As I don&#x27;t own a big cluster and as I sometimes like to code on the run with my laptop,  an integration test typically takes ten minutes with Amazon Elastic Map/Reduce.  It takes some time to code up tests,  but I get it all back with dividends because often I get jobs running with two or three integration test cycles instead of ten or twenty.  When I find problems in the integration tests,  usually I can reproduce them in the unit tests and solve them there.<p>Now,  it did take considerable investment to get to the point where unit testing worked so well for me.  I used to have problems where &quot;the tests worked&quot; but the real application didn&#x27;t because Hadoop reuses Writable objects so if you just pass a List of objects to the reducer,  you might get different results in a test than you do in real life.  Creating an Iterable object that behaves more like Hadoop does solved that problem.<p>Generally if you are feeling that &quot;unit testing sucks&quot; or &quot;mockito sucks&quot; it&#x27;s often that case that you&#x27;re not doing it the right way.",1394122219

You end up with code where you can’t create anything in isolation – it is all tangled together.

Unclear what is done with this data and which companies have access to it.<p>- Security issues: Embedding adds a third party website to your site, with all ability to execute code. Do you know for sure that Getty Images will disclose a hack, that their security is up to par with their target size?<p>- SEO issues: Google image results and iframed externally hosted duplicate images without a user-specifiable alt-attribute do not work well together. Furthermore you can&#x27;t enrich your content with media, which may hamper web search results.<p>- Continuity issues: You won&#x27;t know how aggressive, or low-quality the future advertisements will be. If your site happens to trigger for a porn related term, you run the risk of them bouncing your referrer (or breaking out of i-frame) for breaking their terms. Will you be notified if they discontinue an embedded image and what will the replacement content look like? How fast could you replace a few months worth of images if you want to switch?<p>- Legal issues: Their terms are clear. You can&#x27;t use it commercially. So if you ever add advertising to your site or somehow monetize it, you run the risk of skirting the terms of service of a company that is known to aggressively litigate. You put your users at risk of downloading the image, hosting it somewhere, and getting fined, and you yourself probably run an increased risk, increased attention from Getty Images, when you embed their images.

Things that run off and mutate some global state, or perform an action.<p>Stubs are useful for controlling the execution state of the method under test. You could stub DateTime such that it was midnight in one test, and noon in another, if the behavior of the function relied on that. It does introduce a dependency that has to be changed along with the code, but is often helpful.<p>I do agree with the author that there&#x27;s an art to testing appropriately. You could mechanically write testing code for every line of code under test (if statement with single condition? Two tests to verify each path is taken!), which leads to your app being coded twice: once in code and once (or more) in the tests.",1394121719

(Actually, it gives you more credibility, because you have a personal stake in the problem: You yourself would be hurt by the change you propose.)<p>But it is doublethink if you hold other people in contempt for getting benefits from tax revenue, or if you think they are immoral for doing so.<p>For example, I think Ayn Rand&#x27;s position was not just that &quot;looting&quot; is bad for the country, but that it is immoral and that doing it makes you a bad person. A Randite who made special efforts to get any kind of money from the government would either have to think of themselves as a looter, or make a special exception for themselves.",1394121647

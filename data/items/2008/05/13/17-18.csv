188828,comment,188471,188789,0,0,maxklein,,,"You're wrong. The people who are successful are those who focus on solving the problem. If you are a marketer and you stay at home, you will fail because the problem the marketer faces is outside. If you are a business guy and you spend all day at the computer, you will fail too, because business is about networking and contacts. Each of those people, were they focused, would be doing the activities that are most beneficial for their line of business, and those activities are outside.<p>If however, you are a software developer, and you are outside trying to act like a businessman, then you will fail because you are not focusing on solving the core problem you set out to solve.<p>It's NOT possible to play all the roles. There is no super hacker who is also a super business man. There is no basketball star who is also an extremely successful musician. Those things require focus and dedication, and you cannot do both and be equally successful at both.<p>If you stay at home working on a ""PROBLEM"", not ""PRODUCT"" and the solution you come up with is better than every solution out there, and people want to use it, you will be successful because the guys focused on business will search you out.<p>If the problem you are solving involves search, you need to focus on that. Studying algorithms, AI, all that stuff. If you are spending half your time doing that and the other half looking for venture capital, you are setting yourself up for failure.<p>If however, you are creating a website for musicians and you are not going to music venues and taking notes, you are also losing.<p>Understand where your focus should be for the line of business you are in, and ... focus! If you find it hard or boring to spend so much time focusing on it, then that business was never meant for you.<p>Thinking about your product should be like playing a video game - challenging and fun. If it's not and you prefer to think about money or funding, then you have picked the wrong product.",1210700975

It's a meritocracy out there, folks, especially in terms of media.<p>(""Media"" meaning the layer of communication that connects services and users)<p>That media you create also needs to stand alone as useful information.  Traditional PR is based on leveraging connections (""beating the meritocracy"") on behalf of clients to expose a product to an audience.  One business strategy equivalent of this might be Facebook forcing users to return to Facebook.com to reply to an inter-profile message; it's unnecessary coercion that ultimately degrades the quality of the product.<p>I advise businesses to begin creating an unfair advantage that is based on the preexisting expertise of the management team.  Toyota's marketing channel within Twitter Japan and Miller Brewing's BrewBlog.com are stellar examples of how you can begin to create a marketing channel that attracts attention on its own merit (and has great SEO effects...and scales like a mother).<p>There's a number of other issues to grok here, including viral mechanisms and transparent outreach tactics, that I unfortunately don't have time to get into at the moment.<p>I did get into some of this a little bit on my blog here:<p><a href=""http://www.ethanbauley.com/post/34550190"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ethanbauley.com/post/34550190</a><p>Great question!",1210700408

You don't waste time looking around for the ironic smile. You don't reproach the person for speaking out of turn.<p>But it goes beyond simple cultural coding. The neurologists say that there's a physiological basis for swearing: the brain is wired to do so under certain conditions. Under extreme or sudden distress, swearing helps us cope, and the reverse is probably also true: swearing helps to work you into a rage or a panic. That's one very good reason why we tell kids not to swear and correct them when they do: It's a way of calming them down, and of teaching them to be calm, and of encouraging them to reserve their moments of adrenaline-surging fury for appropriate times.",1210699907

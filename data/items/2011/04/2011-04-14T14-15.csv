They can completely specialize in what they do because they don't have to work to get food. Usually it was because they had a Maecenas who exploited legions of other people to provide (mainly) for himself and (a little) for people who he found interesting (or they provided him with entertainment). And those people created the most innovation, I believe. Innovative farmers would be concerned with how to work on the field so that their backs hurt less, but major advances required seeing the bigger picture.",1302793179
2447057,comment,2445978,2446674,9,0,andywood,,,"Calling Minecraft ""voxel"" is sure to introduce confusion. The representation of the map is simply a regular 3D grid of block IDs. When we use the exact same type of regular grid to represent 2D maps, we do <i>not</i> call the grid cells ""pixels"", so I don't think it's very informative to call these ""voxels"".<p>Minecraft is also <i>not</i> a voxel renderer. Voxel renderers typically work by casting rays against the grid. Minecraft draws the blocks with rasterized triangles, using a hardware-accelerated 3D API (LWJGL), just like almost every other 3D game.<p>In other words, there is practically no interesting overlap between what NovaLogic was doing, and what Minecraft does.",1302793175

2447048,comment,2446752,2446752,64,0,michaelochurch,,,"Farming beat out hunting and gathering because it was more <i>fit</i>. That doesn't mean it was ""better"". Evolution is not necessarily progressive. Evolution is ""survival by that which can spread its genes"", and agricultural people are better at that.<p>Agricultural peoples simply out-populated their nomadic, hunter-gatherer brethren. Both groups of populations stole from the other (and within their group) but agricultural people could raise more soldiers. Nomadic warriors were individually superior (better nutrition, more battle experience, more likely to have up-to-date battle technologies due to mobility) but were no match when outnumbered 20:1 by armed peasants. Also, to rob a farming population, one has to leave some of them alive, and that means that, 14 years later, they have a fresh crop of soldiers.<p>It's (probably) true that the average <i>quality</i> of life declined during 15-4k BC as agriculture spread throughout Eurasia and North Africa-- agriculture made severe and persistent social inequalities possible-- but the <i>quantity</i> grew, as did ""energy capture"", or the ability of humans to draw energy out of the environment. Thus, agriculture won. It couldn't have happened any other way. Also, it wasn't a single choice that happened suddenly. The transitions from nomadic to semi-nomadic to semi-agricultural to fully agricultural lifestyles happened over centuries. Agriculture probably began as a ""last resort"" in event of an ecological catastrophe (Younger Dryas) that depleted game but, as rising human population became a ""constant catastrophe"", overtook hunting and gathering outright.<p>At any rate, until one has agriculture (and religion, as a motivating force) one is very unlikely to see the written word, which is a necessary precursor for modern society. Whether one is better off in 15000 BC vs. 1500 AD, I would honestly call a toss-up, but I'd much rather be alive in 2011 AD than 15000 BC.",1302793024
2447047,comment,2443346,2445817,2,0,kenjackson,,,"First, I conceeded 3rd party app selection in my post, so to spend half of your post pointing that out is... well pointless.  It's important, but I already mentioned it.<p>So now lets look at the actual support:<p>1) AirPlay.  Well WP7 does support DLNA and some phones expose it, such as the LG.  So if you want it, you can get it.<p>2) Unified Inbox.  That is missing, although I suspect by design. It's a feature that would be nice to toggle on, but default off is the right design.<p>3) HTML 5 browser.  It's part of Mango.<p>4) 3G tethering.  It works, just not a supported feature.<p>5) Visual voicemail.  This is actually one gap.  It's suspected that it may be in Mango.  They've had a registry entry for it since first release.<p>6) Local notifications.  Live agents give a superset of the functionality of local notifications.<p>7) FaceTime.  Supports Skype.<p>8) Regular updates.  Users do receive the updates.  ATT is just taking longer than everyone else.  What WP7 does do though is push the updates as they're ready.  This obviously causes some pain for those whose carriers are slower, but its better than waiting for everyone to be ready and ship all at once, giving the impression that everything happened at the same time.<p>So visual voicemail is the biggest scenario I see here.  And if you use Google Voice you get that for free too.<p>Again, at one point in time the holes were huge.  Now, they're small and niche.  You can no longer dismiss WP7 based on feature set at all.  Sure, it has strengths and weaknesses, but the platform as a whole seems stronger than Android/iOS.  3rd party apps are the biggest gap, and I do think with the improved tooling we'll see their app store continue to grow (and its already the fastest growing app store relative to open date).",1302793006

And even the majors put out a lot of good music beyond what makes it into the charts.<p>And it doesn't make sense to consider someone downloading 24/7 because unless you're on dialup, you can download a lot more than 24 hours of music in 24 hours.<p>However it is clear than the value you get from spotify and similar services is very much determined by your attitudes to music. If you cast your net wide and look for gems from across all styles and niches of music, then it's easily worth it. If you just want to listen to indulge your relatively static tastes in the one or two areas of music that concern you, then its a less obvious choice.<p>The question is, are there enough obsessive people who are into Music in the wider sense, and have a need for on demand ""random access"" to any and all artists/genres, to sustain spotify? Because they are the people for whom the service makes sense. People who want to listen to the same 50-100 albums on rotation are unlikely to be persuaded by the pricing model.<p>PS. Yeah, ""tragically limited"" was a thoughtlessly flippant thing to say. Didn't mean to be so condescending.

When internet was young it acted like a teenager: want to be anonymous and talk crap, spam, troll, now this is like a 20years old growing up man -- wants to put his real identity upfront, upload real pictures, organize and connect with real-life friends, etc.<p>Facebook lacks next layer, next growing up stage, that is everyone has multiple identities and act accordingly to situation: work, home, friends, family, lovers, etc. This is pretty much what you said already -- I think Facebook failed with ""groups"" -- they should put more effort into literally enforcing users to organize everyone into real-life ""groups"", so once this is done you can give options to modify feeds from each person. Now, my wall is equally crapped by people I dont want to hear everyday, and my closest family. Its a mess; like well-build Geocites with nice logo on the top...<p>IF Facebook wont put more focus on enforcing people to get into groups, I agree that sooner or later they will start declining. I dont really ""buy"" that whole ""everyone is in so I am not going anywhere"" point; looks at MySpace -- everyone was there. Fast forward 3 years later everyone is somewhere else. The point is, once a website goes viral, friend of friends and their friends start joining, you won't stop migration of users from one website to another -- but obviously first islander need to see benefits and reasons to move on. Once this start, it will NOT be cool anymore to have a Facebook profile.
I cant wait for these days.. not really that I wish bad to someone -- but I want to see how CEO of Facebook will act to save his sinking ship. Oh, I also don't buy the fact that ""entire website is using facebook features, such as ""like"" and forum etc"". Trust me, once a new network kicks in, it is obviously will be #1 goal of every webmaster and administrator to attach a new&cool thing to their website. You will see that new widget everywhere within weeks, if not days!!",1302792354

First of all, seasoned people aren't going to work for deferred cash only, knowing that companies rarely pay it back until they're roaring successes. Deferred pay arrangements usually are, ""we'll pay you $X when we have the cash on hand"" but the problem is that the cash is never truly ""on hand""; in a growing business, there's always a better use for the money than paying zero-interest debt to employees. Venture capitalists don't want their infusions to be spent on back salary, and most CEOs want to invest revenues back into the business.<p>In lieu of equity, deferred pay is a bad deal for the employee: no upside, only downside, and usually on terms that are a lot less creditor-friendly than what banks can negotiate.<p>A further problem with deferred pay is that when things become difficult, it's not much of a motivator. After a year or two, people assume they're never going to get it back and become resentful. It's better off for them to have equity, where they knew full well they might not be repaid.<p><i>If a founder forgoes a salary, why not agree to convert the pay difference relative to the other founders into stock at the time of the first equity financing at the share price negotiated with the VCs?</i><p>This is a decent first-order approximation, but for true fairness, the valuation should be set at the time the deferred-payment arrangement is made and should be lower than what is expected from a VC in the future. Because a deal may not happen, the fair valuation when this arrangement is set is lower than the expected VC valuation.",1302791482

When you have a 50/50 setup, you better make sure that you are comfortable with all the decision-making dynamics that partnership structure will bring.<p>Consider when you have a technical and a semi or non-technical founder. Let's say the technical founder is the visionary for the product you are building, understands what the customer needs (which means he has some/good business savvy) and give direction to all engineering related activities - from technology stack selection to what features and how they will be built. He/she is the one who will take the lead in defining the product and its -hopefully- many iterations going forward. A quick high profile example that comes to mind is Mr. Zuckerberg - he did the programming and he continues to give direction to the product.<p>Now you also have the semi/non-technical founder, who is obviously there because he/she is talented, smart and will have large impact going forward in building customer relationships and contribute to higher level discussion on where the products should go. There is a good chance the company won't go anywhere without this guy either.<p>How would you now do the split? A 50/50 arrangement would mean both parties get the same say/leadership over where the company/technology needs to go. Is that right?  This is not about money, as both parties will be in good shape as long as a reasonable arrangement is chosen.

I think in normal cases the service will help service providers to keep the userdatabase clean of temporary mail addresses. From the point of a user (and I am often only a user looking for services) it should also not be a problem to give a email address away if you trust the provider.<p>But I agree: In special cases acting as a user it is useful not to give someone the email address. Like a creditcard number.<p>From providers angle I would decline such email addresses in every case. Most of the services are free today - so the only return service is to have a communication channel to the user. It's clear for me not to spam my users as I treat them as customers.<p>It's up to you if and how you use the service.

2446848,comment,2445419,2445419,2,0,meterplech,,,"Great post, glad you are coming back to NYC! Wanted to make a comment about your website. I think you overstate cost as a deciding factor for parents. Right now, visiting your website and searching for a tutor the cost and picture are the most highlighted factors about each tutor. From my experience tutoring for 5+ years, most people who seek a tutor for their kid (especially in test prep) care far more about the tutor's capabilities than price.<p>I've been meaning to write a blog post about this, but when I started my tutoring business I was very worried about what I charged. Nervously, I would bring it up at the beginning of early conversations with prospective parents. Later, I realized that parents really use those calls to establish competency. If they believe you are really competent they will pay double or triple the ""average"" price for your help. People consider tutoring, and especially test prep as investments, and like anyone else they care more about their ROI than their exact cost.<p>I think the focus for the search on Tutorspree should be on emphasizing competency. Especially for test prep. So, in the big box where price is now, it could show their applicable SAT/LSAT/GMAT score, and perhaps the number of students they have tutored before. Then it could have a one-liner like ""Graduating cum laude with degrees in Mathematics and Economics"" or whatever. This is addressing what the parents want (especially in ultra affluent and educationally attuned uptown Manhattan).<p>Even more importantly, it makes the tutors feel like they are competing on quality, not on price. This will encourage better tutors to come to your site. Top LSAT companies will pay a tutor $100+/hour and charge $250+/hour. In order for a great tutor to use your site they must feel like they have a chance to get paid at least equivalently. And, I think in the end the most likely way Tutorspree succeeds is by matching parents/students with incredible students.<p></completely_unsolicited_advice><p>Good luck again! I will be NYC based soon, and have worked as a tutor for many years. If you guys would like to bounce ideas off someone with that background, my email is in my profile.",1302790180

So, I agree with you of the value of learning your way around sprawling legacy codebases.

I've since worked at a massive company. I learned a lot from that, but it would have been frustrating had I gone there in my early career. That's the distinction I was trying to draw.<p>Getting red-flagged if you have too short stints at jobs is definitely a risk with taking Jason's advice. When I'm hiring people in the game industry, the most important clue in that respect is whether they stayed long enough to ship the projects they started, within reasonable limits. That usually works out to a 2-3 year minimum. That criterion isn't just meant to weed out job hoppers. The final six months of shipping a game are just qualitatively different (often in unpleasant but educational ways) from the rest of the development cycle.

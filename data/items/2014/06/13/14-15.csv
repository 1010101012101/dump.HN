7889122,comment,7888327,7888327,5,0,moron4hire,,,"I&#x27;m a coffee drinker. For some reason, waiters and baristas look at me funny and ask if I&#x27;m really sure when I say I don&#x27;t want anything in my coffee. Apparently there aren&#x27;t any other black coffee drinkers left in the world. So I&#x27;ve taken to telling them I want my coffee to match my soul: &quot;black and bitter&quot;. This tends to get the point across that I&#x27;m serious when apparently &quot;no, no cream or sugar, I just want black coffee&quot; isn&#x27;t enough.<p>That&#x27;s actually not entirely correct. I hate west-coast style coffee, popularized by the likes of Starbucks. They burn the shit out of their beans, leaving no bean taste, replacing it with nothing but carbon black, and destroying most of the caffeine. I like a light roast coffee with no adornments. It&#x27;s still bitter, but not unbearably so, and I would wager most people who drink coffee with cream would probably drink a well-made light-roast without cream at all, and it is also richly flavorful in many other ways, while providing the an excellent kick.<p>But I also drink sub-optimal coffee straight, too. Who has time to screw around with titrations?<p>I have not been a fan of tea because what I had experienced (even that provided by aficionados here in the states) had been woefully bland. It mostly tasted like hot water, with a slight floral taste, that ultimately reminded me too much of dishwater.<p>But on a recent vacation in Ireland, my wife insisted we &quot;take tea&quot; one day. First of all, coupling something with a smorgasbord of snacks is a brilliant way to get me to try anything new. But more importantly, the place we were at had given us twice as much leaf as anyone I had ever seen, apparently with the intention that the drinker would choose their own steeping time. I left mine in the entire time and found that I enjoyed it more and more as it steeped. My favorite was nearly indistinguishable from coffee in both color, bitterness, and caffeine kick.<p>So there we have it. I had given up on tea for 20 years of my life because most people who pick up tea in the states do it because they are too weak of spirit to handle coffee, not because of any inherent problem in tea itself.",1402671335

I have a few DigitalOcean droplets for customer sites, but after checking the stats and almost never seeing the CPU(s) spike over 50% (if that much) I bought a Kimsufi with 1TB storage and 16GB (non-ECC) RAM and it way outperforms the DO droplets&#x27; response time for static assets. I now use it as a static file server for the DO Droplets, plus personal storage.<p>The network speeds are great and constant, DDOS protection included as standard, and I&#x27;m on Gigabit fiber plus close to France so couldn&#x27;t be happier.<p>The non-ECC RAM could be a problem over time, but I keep multiple redundant backups and test them regularly, so the small chance of data corruption would only be a nuisance.<p>Also, the next level up as far as hardware quality is the &#x27;So You Start&#x27; range, so look at that too.

It&#x27;s interesting how quickly you tire of buying expensive things. Good to learn this lesson early.<p>Then:<p>Education - despite grumblings about rising cost and legends of the Silicon Valley dropout billionaires, a degree still leads to earning an additional $1m+ over your career and provides a good foundation. Getting an education and leaving without debt will put you in a really strong position compared to your peers, who will be weighed down with student loan debt for decades.<p>Housing - Depending on where you are, put 20% down on a 30-year fixed mortgage on a modest but nice house (average for the area). If you move, you can rent it out. The bulk of household wealth is in primary residences. This will put you decades ahead of your peers, who due to student loan debt will be unlikely to be able to purchase homes until well into their 30s.<p>Mutual funds - Mutual funds allow you to match growth in the stock market. You are young so can put money into the aggressive funds which may even beat it, but don&#x27;t worry too much about beating the market, even pros have a poor track record at that.

When a cake is being shared I may want to eat the whole cake alone, but I may still offer you half the cake out of a sense of fairness. For the predictions of game theory it is the decision-making ranking and not the desirability one which enters into payoffs.<p>If you deny the meaningfulness of talking about different ways of ranking then of course any notion of altruism becomes self-contradictory: &quot;He gains enjoyment by starving himself to feed the poor, that&#x27;s why he does it.&quot; But in practice we distinguish between masochists and saints.<p>Helping others may help you survive if selfish people are ostracized by others (as seem to happen in human societies) or if a good turn today entitles you to a good turn tomorrow. But the evolutionary theory of altruism is not something I understand very well. My only point was that contrary to what the OP suggests, the formal techniques of game theory such as Nash equilibrium are agnostic with respect to nature of payoffs. And both casual observation and systematic experiments in economics show that many humans act out of a sense of fairness and expect fairness from others even when interacting with strangers.",1402669399

Much of what we build now consists of smaller bodies of code, sitting at the end of a service pipeline, or collaborating in a distributed system.

I&#x27;ll talk about this below.<p>VPS: If you&#x27;re suggesting hosting a few websites and a small amount of email then a VPS is fine. Prometeus is my favourite for reliability and price. However bare in mind that with a VPS you&#x27;re host can look into your files whenever they like (mounting the image/device if Xen/KVM) and just entering your container if it&#x27;s OpenVZ. So for sensitive data I don&#x27;t recommend a VPS. Also you may be put under restrictions if you max out your CPU and memory usage for long periods of time.<p>Dedicated Server: This is good for large storage and if you want unrestricted CPU and memory usage. You can obviously virtualize your own servers onto this and you can also run Windows and Linux (+ OS X). This has all the benefits of having your own physical box/colocation plus you get free hardware replacements.<p>Own hardware: If you&#x27;re happy with just relying on your network connection then you can host it at home with a small quarter rack and just put a rack mount server in there. There are some benefits with this. If you&#x27;re just torrenting, hosting email and a light web server or even just for testing you can get an old server off eBay or craigslist for next-to-nothing and you have the benefits of owning the hardware and putting in as many HDDs as you like. If you&#x27;re coloing then you also get a very good network connection and reliable uptime, and a public-facing IP address. Oh and having your own physical hardware is cool, and colocation is even more cool and fun to do!",1402668690

It may not be impossible to write big functioning python apps, but it&#x27;s damn hard.<p>And specifically, it&#x27;s a lot harder than doing it in java or C++. I&#x27;ve seen C++ codebases that exceed 8 million lines of code and held together (not without friction, that I guarantee). I&#x27;ve seen java codebases with about half that that held together a lot better than the C++ ones.<p>Even accounting for the fact that python easily lets you achieve 5 times as much in the same amount of lines (at the cost, imho, of more surprises when wrong types get passed to your functions). I&#x27;m not sure &quot;normal python&quot; is more than a little bit more succint than (good) C++ though. Easier to read, sure, if you&#x27;re allowed to make assumptions about types. But not that much shorter.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to see the first million line python codebase. And python has certainly had sufficient time to develop such codebases. Why aren&#x27;t they here already ? Those C++ codebases were almost operating systems though (with extremely tricky threading support libraries, every project it&#x27;s own of course), something you fundamentally can&#x27;t do in python. The java codebases were financial stuff though, something that could easily be done in python, and they certainly have the money to absorb the increased hardware cost, and looking to have faster development turnaround. That&#x27;s another discussion I can guarantee you will have with your boss if your app really grows, the hardware cost. When it comes right down to it, a programmer is worth (rule of thumb) about 15 servers. If python means one less programmer, but 50 extra servers, you will lose that discussion with your boss.<p>Dynamic typing is certainly a massive advantage for small codebases.

The new leader at this point can then force a truncation of a follower&#x27;s log, or ignore it entirely.<p>The entry you have read from a node that was thought to still be a master without first consulting a majority is therefore possibly a bad write that won&#x27;t be part of history as far as consensus goes.<p>This is explained later in the original Raft paper, and this is why you need to read from the quorum to be able to guarantee consistency under all circumstances, among other problem cases.",1402668280

I came to this conclusion after a few months of therapy and reading several books about ADHD (Driven to Distraction was the first of a rather deep rabbit hole). I was terrified that I&#x27;d lose that creative spark I always held unique, because that&#x27;s what previous psychiatric medicine had done to me.<p>Bupropion (Wellbutrin) isn&#x27;t just a dopamine reuptake inhibitor: it&#x27;s also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (which is why it&#x27;s also prescribed for smoking cessation). It didn&#x27;t work with me. I was calmer, less hyperactive: but I had a flat affect. I could concentrate on busywork, but I couldn&#x27;t <i>think</i>. It also wasn&#x27;t prescribed for ADHD: it was the second attempt to treat a (non-existent) bipolar disorder when I was 15. I&#x27;m pretty sure (at this point) my neurochemistry is such that my reuptake rate is fine, but my release/synthesis rate is much too low. Which is why a reuptake inhibitor seemed to only work part way.<p>The first tried, however was Depakote. In extreme cases it&#x27;s prescribed to stabilize mood and impulse control with ADHD. It&#x27;s usually prescribed to quell manic episodes and control seizures. I only dully remember my time on it. I do remember being in a constant fog, a miasma - while I couldn&#x27;t really think straight beforehand, I could barely think /at all/ on that medication. I was on 900mg/day. Given my bodyweight at the time, my plasma concentrations were probably well above the typical controlled therapy concentrations of 100mg/L. It was probably closer to 200mg/L, which explains the stupor and slight tremors I had.<p>Given its pharmacology, I can&#x27;t see how it is, in good conscience, prescribed to those with ADHD unless a manic skewed bipolar disorder is also present.<p>But the story of why they were absolutely convinced I was manic/bipolar is another thing entirely.",1402668180

7888852,comment,7888327,7888613,6,0,Theodores,,,"The French upper class were the first to popularise the idea of adding milk to tea. This was back in the days of Napoleon and fine china, as in from China, was new too.<p>The reason for adding the milk first was to protect their finest quality china from cracking due to the heat of the tea (the teapots were metal, e.g pewter around that time too).<p>So, the origins of the milk first idea are deeply rooted in history. If you are drinking tea in 18th century fine china tea cups handed down from your aristocratic French ancestors, then you might not want to experiment with the tea first technique, however, if you drink tea out of a mug then consider the benefits of tea first.<p>As for whether &#x27;tea first&#x27; needs a stir, the answer is not yes. There are convection currents inside the cup that will stir the milk in for you. A helping stir does help but is not always necessary particularly if the tea has cooled too much.<p>> 3. adding the milk to an already boiling cup of tea burns the milk, ruining the flavour of the tea.<p>No. The tea has to infuse in the teapot before pouring. Therefore it is not boiling by the time it gets to the cup and the milk can&#x27;t be &#x27;ruined&#x27;.<p>Unless you are using tea bags, teabags are an excellent innovation, personally I prefer single cup tea bags, tea made in cup with none of the paraphernalia of the pot. If you want a sharp cup of tea with no bitter taste an average teabag in cup with boiling water and no milk yet will work perfectly. No need for lengthy infusion time, add milk, get colour right, squeeze and remove bag, sharp cuppa made.<p>Orwell gets it wrong regarding the matter of drawing fresh water. Most water contains things that lead to limescale. It is important to draw fresh water so that limescale does not build up in the kettle. Dissolved oxygen levels is cited by some as important, theoretically you are boiling the oxygen out of the water too much if you reboil rather than draw fresh. This sort of makes sense and &#x27;experts&#x27; say it makes sense but I have not tested this myself or seen a scientific paper explaining how this works.<p>A final detail: unpasteurised, fresh milk. Tea made with this &#x27;forbidden fruit&#x27; is far better than when made with normal milk. The difference is hard to describe, but, to give you an idea it is like the difference between listening to traffic noise on the edge of a motorway and listening to Handel&#x27;s &#x27;Zadok the Priest&#x27; being sung by a choir in Westminster Abbey.",1402668013

Would be nice if pg added  a simple google search box hack with something like site:news.ycombinator to do this automatically.  Certainly kill this problem. Wonder how regular google indexes the site? Because even then, as new stuff is added the lag in crawling & indexing  the problem persists.<p>We need dynamic search.

It's either give away the UI as plugins or re-building Mozilla (think flock). is this a reasonable approach to solving the <i>we don't trust you with our data</i> problem yet still using a web based API?

24510,comment,24004,24338,0,0,akkartik,,,"""if you can write down in sufficient detail your idea so that 'a person of reasonable skill in the trade' can implement it,"" <i>you have in fact implemented it</i>. Your approach is just less efficient; in most areas a whiteboard is not an effective way to be sure your design works, that you have considered all possibilities.<p>You are persistently ignoring all the <i>execution</i> that goes into nuclear weapons, GPS, etc. If you think implementing nuclear weapons was trivial in the 50s and 60s (50 years after the theory was in place), talk to israel. In fact the huge difference in times different applications have entered the market is an indicator that the theory of relativity is not the bottleneck. Something else is: the engineering constraints. Why have science fiction writers consistently anticipated new technologies? Because thinking up the idea could happen before it was practical to implement. Should those writers receive royalties for geostationary satellites or submarines?<p>Lots of theories go into each new application, rather than one theory spawning lots of new applications.<p>Not all ideas are worthless. But until you have shown there are no subtle deal-breakers (think fusion reactors) there is no reason to assume your idea has value in the current historical, social, economic context.<p>Valuing ideas may be right in the entertainment world.

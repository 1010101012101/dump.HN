One is that one person who slips up either through a misunderstanding or spite will throw off the average. Another consideration is that if you win with zero or one, you will have to split any prize pool with many other players.",1249098942
735954,comment,735917,735917,0,0,Osmose,,,"A lot of people keep their hands at the keyboard for long periods of time; excessive use of keyboard shortcuts keeps you in the same position for longer. I find that typing in bursts works better for me; I hold my chin, lean back, etc. while I ponder what to code next. Rather than keeping your wrist in the same position a lot, it gets to flex and move around.<p>I had a lot more pain while coding at home because I would sit at the computer more often, but when working at an office, I have to get up and talk to people more often, and it really makes a difference.<p>As for eye strain, getting a dark color layout for your code editor of choice and keeping most of your GUI dark helps. Black text on a white background is like staring into a lightbulb.",1249098922

Seriously.<p>Have you ever been in a position where someone else is legally entitled to take possession of your entire present worth? I have. It's a nightmare. Just imagine what it feels like to be in a position where someone is legally allowed to rape you for the rest of your life... the frustration and anger would not allow me to focus on any productive work. Maybe it would work differently for you.",1249098788

735949,comment,735917,735917,0,0,seanb,,,"Unless it has been diagnosed as carpel tunnel syndrome, I would guess that the wrist pain is actually a more general ""repetitive stress injury"" (RSI).  Proper posture helps a lot for this, as does taking regular mini-breaks to let your wrists rest.  Software RSI break timers help; I use AntiRSI on my mac.  The idea is to let your arms hang down for 10 seconds or so every 5-10 minutes.  Take longer breaks regularly, and stretch your wrists, arms and shoulders.<p>Google 'RSI wrist stretches' (or exercises), etc.  The book ""It's not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome! RSI Theory & Therapy for Computer Professionals"" is highly praised, but I haven't read it personally.<p>I've found that a trackball is much easier on my wrist when I'm forced to do any mousing.  The Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 helped too, but I couldn't stand the space bar's noise and action -- it's worth looking into a more friendly keyboard anyway.<p>Edit:  As for eye strain, try to focus on something in the distance while you're letting your wrists rest.  Human eyes aren't particularly well suited for focusing close-up for long periods of time, so you should let them relax once in a while.",1249098597

I bet it is pretty unusual for anybody to buy multiple copies of a given book at once, so defaulting to one and giving the opportunity to adjust later made sense. Now that they sell many things that are probably bought in multiple quantities (say, socks), customers are probably having to adjust the quantities more often.<p>All very well, but sometimes I wish they would spend a bit more time on their wishlists - not much has changed since the beginning and some more effort in this area is overdue by now.",1249098450

The RIAA really lucked out by suing someone even douchier than themselves, and then got an exponential boon when the plaintiff's counsel (Charlie Nesson) turned out to me even more of an asshat by orders of magnitude.<p>The plaintiff in the first case was a fuckup too, to a lesser degree.

735926,comment,734487,734556,0,0,jrockway,,,"Indeed.  Java and C# are some of the least flexible programming languages around.  The problem, though, is that people like being told what to do.  They don't want to wonder if they are implementing something correctly, they want to know that they are ""following best practice"".  They don't want to invent their own features, they want to read a cool blog post about something ""the experts"" came up with and then try using that in their application.<p>This produces horrible code, of course, but since it sort of works and nobody knows any better, it's the norm.  (Most programmers don't know programming.  Why they want to be a programmer is beyond me, but it happens.)<p>The people that have a deep understanding of programming and know what they want to do and how to do it are not using Java or C#.",1249096621

But together PHP seems like a big ball of mud.<p>I'm actually a big user (and defender) of PHP; between posting this I'm working on PHP code.  I've used it since PHP 3.0 and I'm pretty forgiving of legacy problems -- it's an organic language with pieces added when they're needed.  The PHP 3.0 time was great because every release (which was frequent) brought some new feature you were wishing for.<p>PHP 5.0 has been great and PHP 6.0 with unicode is going to be a nice addition too.  But it's like 2 steps forward and 1 step back.  There's no reason for PHP to add namespaces in such a confusing and different way.  PHP borrows from C, Java, Perl, and C++ and anyone familiar with those languages is going to feel comfortable with it.  But this namespace implementation is just bizarre.  And it can't be blamed on any legacy issues or backwards compatibility.",1249096570

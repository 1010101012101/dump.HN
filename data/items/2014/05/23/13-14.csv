Sometimes I need to ask developers to do  things I don&#x27;t believe in or things I&#x27;ll throw away in a few months. This also demotivates me. You need both a lot of discipline and just a bit &quot;aloofness&quot; to keep going. Care less about those tasks, think about friday.<p>If your managers are any good, they know you have wasted hours, they know you are unmotivated, and they know those meaningless tasks are the reason, this is why you are a valued employee. I&#x27;d rather argue to death with an employee because he thinks his idea is best for the company than one that will just accept any task like a robot. But sometimes you have to implement ridiculous things into software, from clients being just crazy or because of some strange contract clause. This is when discipline kicks in. Such situations shouldn&#x27;t happen often, but if they are, that&#x27;s when you should move on.<p>You don&#x27;t need to get &quot;in the zone&quot; to get the job done. Just start by doing smaller pieces, put your headphones on. You could just ask why feature is being built, but I doubt knowing the reason will motivate you at all.",1400853587

Dependency injection sort of hides what goes on in your code and makes it hard to follow.<p>Developers who are used Rails, Django, Laravel and other large frameworks might not really care, and they might not need to. You develop for and with the framework you picked an understand and accept that stuff works a certain way, because that&#x27;s what the framework does. If however you&#x27;re a Go developer and want to do web development Gorilla will seem like a better approach than Martini og Revel, because it&#x27;s just add the bits you&#x27;re missing. Picking a larger framework and you get locked in doing stuff their way, and the dependency injection and &quot;magic&quot; makes it hard or impossible to escape the framework, should you want to.<p>For me, I like to be able to look a just my own code and reason about what it does, without ending in &quot;here I pass a bunch of stuff of the framework and hope it does the right thing&quot;. Normally I know what I want and if the framework has these magical bits they more often than not get in the way... I&#x27;m looking at you stupid Django Rest Framework.",1400853574

We do get snow from about November-March but its generally sporadic, however, there&#x27;s usually 2-3 big snows a year. Despite this, we still get (on average) 300 days of sunshine a year [0].<p>For work, Foco has offices for Hewlett Packard, Intel, AMD, Avago, National Semiconductor, LSI, and Wolf Robotics. If the start-up scene is more your taste, Fort Collins-Loveland was rated 2nd in the &quot;Top 10 Metro Areas for High-Tech Startup Density&quot; in the United States (with Boulder at #1) in 2013 [1], and is also home to a start-up incubator called Rocky Mountain Innosphere [2].<p>There are miles of bike trails [3] all over the city and many places to hike nearby as well [4]. Needless to say lots of people are out and about being physically active around here and biking is often the preferred mode of transportion.<p>Other than that I just personally enjoy the atmosphere out here. Since we have a university in town there are tons of little hole-in-the-wall coffee shops open 24/7 (or close to it) and lots of specialty food in the form of restaurants, food trucks, food carts, ect. Old Town area is the main social scene and is always bustling whether people are out getting a bite to eat, walking around, or there are often various festivals taking place. Micro-brew Beer is also a huge part of the culture around here (at least in my circles), as fort collins is home to New Belgium, Odell, and many other micro-breweries and holds a huge beer festival called New West Fest every year. In all, it&#x27;s a quirky little city that I quite enjoy.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve lived in the Loveland/Ft. Collins area for 6 years now and just finished my CS degree at Colorado State University.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.fcgov.com/visitor/fcfacts.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fcgov.com/visitor/fcfacts.php</a><p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2013/08/young-hightech-firms-outpace-private-sector-job-creation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2013/08/young-hightech-firm...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.innosphere.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.innosphere.org/</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.fcgov.com/bicycling/pdf/bike-map-front.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fcgov.com/bicycling/pdf/bike-map-front.pdf</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://alltrails.com/us/colorado/fort-collins?ref=header"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alltrails.com/us/colorado/fort-collins?ref=header</a><p>edit: formatting",1400853449

If you mean &quot;won&#x27;t bring in anymore customers&quot;, have that conversation with your managers. Not all of them are brilliant, and no one gets it right 100% of the time. If you can prove that the feature doesn&#x27;t provide value, have that conversation with them.<p>On the other hand, if your boss ignores your input, and you&#x27;re 1000% sure that there are other features that are more valuable to your business than the one in question, you can always push that one to the back and work on something that&#x27;s more productive to the company. Depending on your political and professional circumstances, your boss may not notice or care, and their boss may forget about their red herring feature; you might be able to side-step the conversation altogether.

This is not one problem , but three: it is a problem with wisdom, speed, <i>and</i> discipline.<p>Luckily, we can learn tricks to improve each one.<p>If we want to attack this from the wisdom perspective, it is this: You are afraid of making the wrong decision because you are afraid to refactor. You are afraid to refactor because you don&#x27;t have sufficient test coverage.<p>The good news is, for developers like us, test driven development is very helpful as a technique for getting us over these problems. If our team is not test-friendly, however, it will be difficult for us to make the jump because their code will not be written in ways to make it easy to test.<p>There are a few books I can suggest to help us jump the chasm:<p>1. Clean Code by Bob Martin. This book helped me think in more testable code, and also helped me understand how to make better decisions the first time around. It helped me by seeing patterns I didn&#x27;t know first.<p>2. Refactoring by Martin Fowler. This one is old, but knowing the patterns of changing code gives us more confidence in knowing what is right, rather than hemming and hawing over what is readable and maintainable.<p>3. Refactoring From Legacy Code by Michael Feathers can help get from here to there. All of these help from three aspects: They help us develop a set of tests so we are less afraid of breaking existing things, they give us the freedom to experiment, and they help us break things down into smaller, more manageable problems by letting us think about &quot;what is the next thing I can test?&quot;<p>If we have the tests, we can be more aggressive in reducing complexity.<p>___<p>If we want to attack this from a Speed issue, then look for these things.<p>1. Look for patterns you use repeatedly, and try to settle down into a process. The fewer choices we make, the faster we can go.<p>2. Look to learn more about your chosen stack and language. It is possible that we are rewriting the wheel over and over. The more you understand the zen of your stack, the faster you can go and the more time you can devote to writing the same thing twice (without them knowing.)<p>3. Instead of hemming and hawing about the right solution, write all three. It is often faster to write all three and choose one than to get stuck in analysis paralysis. (That isn&#x27;t to say you shouldn&#x27;t think before you write code!)<p>___<p>Finally, you can attack this from a discipline angle.<p>1. Learn to meditate. By doing so, you can become more self-aware of analysis paralysis, calm your mind quickly, and mindfully choose a path.<p>2. Exercise. In the same way as meditation, exercise helps us learn to clear our mind and focus on command, and it helps sharpen our discipline chops.<p>With these, we can develop an awareness of how our body feels. Then we can develop an awareness of how analysis paralysis feels. If we can catch ourselves in the act, we can then institute something from our analytical skills: When caught in the trap, set 30 minutes on your timer, and bring out a pad of paper. If you feel you have the freedom, turn off the monitor.<p>Take deep breaths, and sketch out the solutions in the first ten minutes on the first page. Use UML or your own system.<p>In the next ten minutes, write a pro/con analysis on each path.<p>In the final ten minutes, make the decision. After this, your analysis time is up and you must code.<p>I suggest a combination of the above.<p>Good luck! It was one of the hardest things for me to defeat.",1400852794

I didn&#x27;t mean to.)<p>The GrrlScientist blog entry is better in (for instance) the following ways. It gives more context (e.g., Lorenz&#x27;s earlier observation about formerly-captive animals running on wheels). It gives more information about the frequency of wheel-running by different kinds of animal. It is more accurate on at least one important point (article and GrrlScientist say 200k animal visits recorded of which 12k used the wheel; phys.org says 200k instances of animals using the wheel). It mentions, where phys.org doesn&#x27;t, a very important finding: wheel-running continued even after the experimenters stopped putting food near the wheel, so it wasn&#x27;t just that animals run on the wheel because they&#x27;ve found food there and think getting into the wheel will somehow provide more. It describes the article&#x27;s comparison to wheel running in lab mice.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s also more chattily verbose, which might be a good thing or a bad according to taste.<p>What&#x27;s problematic about phys.org is that it&#x27;s scarcely ever the best source for anything. Much of its content is recycled press releases, exactly the same as you can get from (usually) the website of the institution where the work was done but often with some illustrations removed and extra advertising added. Sometimes (as here) phys.org does actually write its own material, but (as here) it&#x27;s usually more superficial and less informative than one can get from elsewhere.<p>There may be cases in which the phys.org writeup is (1) not just recycled from someone else and (2) the best available account of the matter for some plausible audience.

Code&#x27;s needs are not evenly distributed, in fact they are <i>very</i> unevenly distributed (power law distribution I suspect without proof)... carefully crafting to the n-th degree an end-user GUI page for a marginal feature is probably a waste of time, just make it work. On the other hand, adding a hack to a core routine used by huge swathes of the code may have much bigger negative effects than it even feels like now, and it sounds like it already feels pretty bad.<p>Consider working on the next level and using this as a chance to study when and where the effort is actually worth it. It may <i>feel</i> like you&#x27;re handing yourself a license to be sloppier, but if done correctly this actually turns you into an <i>even more</i> capable developer than someone who finely engineers everything, because you&#x27;ll have that much more time to finely engineer the things that matter once you clear away the time of fine engineering of the things that don&#x27;t, and on the whole you&#x27;ll be creating much more value in your code.",1400851961

I know they can be annoying and you probably get too many of them, but turning them off means that you won&#x27;t know when your credit card expires and your domain isn&#x27;t going to renew automatically (for example).<p>2. Use a valid, real email address for your owner contact. Use WHOIS Privacy if you are concerned about spammers harvesting WHOIS for emails. Don&#x27;t use support@ or webmaster@ unless you check those emails regularly. ICANN now requires your registrar to verify your email address and a single bounced email to the owner contact triggers that process. If you don&#x27;t see it, you&#x27;ll be offline in 15 days.<p>3. Treat your domains as the valuable assets they are. Yes, $15/year...not expensive in the grand scheme of things. But the value of that domain is likely much, much higher to you and your company.<p>ps.

This is pretty normal for inexperienced developers. It&#x27;s something you should focus on working on.<p>Here&#x27;s how I developed that skill:<p>1) Remind myself that this is not my company or my project. It&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s.

If I&#x27;ve voiced my concerns and thoughts and been overruled, then my job is to get what is asked of me done to the best of my ability.<p>2) Have side projects that ARE personal and that I CAN be emotionally invested in. When you have a side project where you do call the shots and it&#x27;s done 100% the way you want, you will find it is easier to not be so emotional over your day job.<p>3) Lastly, I have found that as I get more experienced and better at explaining myself, situations where managers overrule me and tell me to do something that is against my own recommendation become more and more rare (they&#x27;ll still happen sometimes as long as someone above you can make unilateral decisions, so never expect it to fully go away.)<p>It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;ve recognized your situation needs to change.

It&#x27;s possible, but pretty darn unlikely.<p>And if that serialization format were ruby marshal... there&#x27;s actually a &#x27;marshal version&#x27; embedded with marshaled serializations, which changes independently of ruby version, can change to indicate backwards incompat, but I don&#x27;t believe has changed in quite some time, not between 1.9.3 and 2.1.x.  So again, if the marshal version is the same, we&#x27;d be shocked (and it would unambiguously be a bug) if there were anything handled differently between versions. (Okay, that&#x27;s not entirely true, I can think of some counter-examples too).<p>I think it really is about YAML, and the mistaken design decisions in the way much of rubydom has historically used it, which continue to pile up.<p>Note that I think ActiveRecord `serialized` uses YAML in the db, so that&#x27;s another place you might find yourself &quot;sharing state&quot; via YAML between diff ruby versions -- if you upgrade to ruby 2.1 and have it reading a database created with an earlier ruby version. Oops.<p>Maybe the lesson is really that serialization is way harder to get right than you think, in terms of both security and  forwards compatibility (future-proofness).",1400850383

His first choice would have been a PHP framework (in 2014!), yet he goes on to criticize a bunch of languages which have sane == operators seemingly on the basis of his gut reaction to their very existence, while asserting things like &quot;Python is like driving on the autobahn without guard rails&quot; and &quot;Lua is the sweet spot between Ruby and Python.&quot; That might be true if Python had shipped with exactly two data structures, and Ruby with zero, and neither of them had integers.<p>This is all before the frameworks are even discussed, which are included and dismissed for reasons just as arbitrary. Smaller frameworks like Sinatra are discarded because they can&#x27;t handle the complex logic that flash cards demand, Django&#x27;s out because of the whole auto safety thing, and we all know that ExpressJS didn&#x27;t show up at Jaques&#x27; birthday party that one time. Play&#x27;s out because Scala is unfamiliar, despite that not being a specific quality of Scala and just something that&#x27;s true in general of programming languages one hasn&#x27;t bothered to learn.<p>So the final list contains some more PHP horror shows and a few Java and Go frameworks to make things look democratic. Thankfully, Rails makes an appearance, but it feels like this is just because it was lucky enough not to get hit by a dart.<p>Let it be a lesson -- we all procrastinate, but when you get to the point where you&#x27;re writing blog posts about dozens of languages and tools, none of which you have direct experience with, the best thing is just to pick something, do what you&#x27;d meant to do in the first place (although you will note that writing the flash card app was itself a way to procrastinate on learning Romainian), and discuss the pros and cons of the tools you chose once you actually know what they are.",1400850213

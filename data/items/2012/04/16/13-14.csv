I was simply saying that from his vantage point, hooking up customers and vendors who were already in the market can be a valid business model.<p>I believe you are talking about bringing new people into the market as vendors and then treating them poorly. Hopefully we can agree that folks that are already doing cleaning can continue doing it just using this guy's services to find customers. If not,if the point is that all cleaners should be w-2 employees, then yes, no matter what he does it will not satisfy somebody with that view. I do not believe all cleaners should be employees.

They cost more per ride, but it's worth it if you measure time in dollars per minute.<p>I didn't really see any ""hidden cost"" there except for the ""time is money"" argument. By that measure, I could include the hidden cost of going to places with long lines, talking to long-winded people, or anything else.<p>Uber has a nice service, and I've used them here in New York when cabs are changing shifts and scarce, and I have to be somewhere <i>right now</i>. They are much, much more expensive than cabs, and even more expensive than a call-ahead car service. That's why I only use them in very specific situations. They're convenient and expensive.

The checklist could just be the terms of contract completion, and you'd have to make sure the checklist was not a job description. Whether or not the contractors conspire to set the price or anything is none of your concern. You're simply a clearing house for very small cleaning contracts.<p>I think it's very doable.

I understand that refusing to let people mention your hugely popular event without paying is a quick way to make money. But does it help in the long term?<p>For events no one's ever heard of, obviously, it would be better to spread the word, rather than delete all unofficial mentions. It seems to me that eventually, the Superbowl will be better known as ""the Big Game"" or some other euphemism, and the NFL will be stuck wondering why they squandered their valuable trademark.<p>The Olympics, due to its historical nature, may be less susceptible. But how do you trademark a term that has been used since ~750 BC? I'm wondering what would happen if there were a movement to follow the rules religiously. Imagine if the only place you heard ""Olympics"" was in crappy advertisements? And every real human you talked to just said ""The Quadrennial International Grab-Bag of Sports"".

Awesome job! This is the internet equivalent of going door-to-door. In fact, I bet you could combine this with going door to door and see sales really take off :)<p>The scaling thing Edw brings up doesn't concern me right now: you are in the throes of kicking ass. Later on reality will sink in. But he's right -- you have some major changes to make if you really want to go long-term with this.<p>Patio has a more legal concern: that your cleaners are really workers. I'm not so sure. I'd see a lawyer about this pronto. If these folks were already doing some cleaning before you met them, and if you make it clear that there is no office, there is no work hours, they are free to take or not take work, and that their only obligation to you is completing each job they sign up for? I think you might be fine. It's certainly a lot less control that software contractors have over them, and they're contractors.<p>Instead of growing, I'd concentrate on making this thing hands-off. Hire a temp to do the office work, etc. Even if it eats into most of your income, once you are freed up then you'll be in a position to really expand. This ""make the business a machine"" is your next step. At least according to everybody I read.<p>I liked the post.

All the pontifications around threats to Internet Freedom and the oft-referenced perils of walled gardens aside, where is Google going here?  Where's the revenue?<p>How is Google going to compete going forward, and with what?  With Google+?  Google Wallet?  GMail?  Google Play?  Google Glasses?  Are these offerings growing (fast) enough to support Google?  How do they recoup their investments in these and other projects?<p>What will Google do as the search market becomes increasingly commoditized and specialized and, yes, fragmented?  The ever-present walled gardens are just one part of this.  It appears likely that the flagship Google apps and services will become increasing commoditized, and available from existing providers such as Rackspace and Amazon, or entrants such as HP Cloud and Microsoft Windows Azure?  By providers that might choose to offer better customer support, for instance.<p>How is Google going to continue to provide a platform for their advertisements, when queries are being fed (from apps and tools and walled gardens) more directly to specific (and tailored) hosts and search engines; with queries directly connected into Yelp, LinkedIn, Wolfram Alpha?<p>How are they going to recoup their investments in the Android platform?  Chrome?  With their investments in browser search boxes?<p>Certainly this whole effort involves speeches and press releases and related marketing, but I don't see the platforms and the updates and the new sources of revenues that the Google folks need to be investing in; not at the scale that they need to maintain themselves.  Walled gardens have and will continue to happen and tech markets can and will fragment, particularly if the results cater to the end-users and provide sufficient the revenues for the vendors.<p>TL;DR: What's Google doing about their risk for disintermediation?",1334581604

He's also probably glossing over things to make his story sound more dramatic and impressive.<p>Sorry to hear about your history with him though.  That sucks.  =T",1313333904

None of us sign a literal social contract; it is a way to name an arrangement of affairs that we semi-willingly enter into (if you buy into it; on the other hand you may not: a baby born dependent on the world has neither the ability nor the wherewithal to enter into contracts - but that's another debate).<p>Sam can be seen to be acting as an agent of those in the periphery of the social contract, those who participate in it not because of mutual gain but because of implicit or explicit threat. The central question, IMHO, is one of what their claims are on our moneys (or social experiments). Sam quotes Mill and (again IMHO) legitimately raises deeper ethical considerations. In that sense, Sam's experiment is a deeper and significantly more interesting version of the original one, and the results (including the response) deserve examination - at least once the built-up rage is spent.",1313333275

2883744,comment,2883043,2883400,1,0,mentat,,,"I'm unclear on how you're drawing the scope of donors vs ""everyone"". It's, for all practical purposes, impossible to make a judgment about the moral impact of an action for everyone. There are so many secondary effects of every action that instead you're choosing two points in that space of impact and saying coffee vs orphans, which is really conceding the whole point. Sam took money intended for one purpose and used it for another. The purpose was embodied in the will of the donors and no other people.<p>Take for instance a simple second order impact, someone gets a free coffee of the card and decides that while it was a good coffee, he or she should instead donate 10x that to feed orphans. If more than 10% of people using the card do this, then there's a 1:1 follow on donation effect to the orphans. That is essentially the idea of ""pay it forward"" as far as I understand it. Sam decided that betting on his fellow humans wasn't a good one (perhaps knowing his own moral failings) and decided to short circuit the process and make decisions for others. This is the essential problem and why it's not part of the ""pay it forward"" experiment. The theft was not paying it forward, it was paying it out. It was removing the opportunity for others to be inspired to give.",1313332921

When he was brought onto Odeo, the idea was to be manifested in the form of SMS alerts. I find it hard to believe that he had what we know today as Twitter in his mind at the outset.

Even if there's no evidence (because the code is being constructed at the time) that this matters from a performance perspective, you should spend the hour or two and get that low-hanging fruit and not worry about it being ""premature"". If you don't do this when you're in-context, it'll cost an order of magnitude more time later on if the problem is discovered in profiling and needs to be addressed in the future.<p>When premature optimization is evil is when it damages code aesthetics and maintainability. There is a limit, in performance, to what can be achieved with aesthetically clean code. What awful programmers (who think they're being clever) tend to do is write the ugly, dirty code because it's super-fast, but no one can maintain it and even they don't understand it.<p>What good programmers do is write clean code on sound fundamentals first, so that people can understand what's going on. Then, if a performance problem's discovered and a certain module needs to be optimized, they put the critical region behind a clean interface and allow the dirtiness (which they document heavily) to be in the implementation.<p>TL;DR: spend time to make your code performant if it doesn't damage code health; be very cautious about replacing clean code with faster, dirty code.",1313332599

Collective funds aren't new, nor is using Twitter as an API for tracking things in the real world. I don't have any good guesses here.<p>Second, why has the community reacted so passionately? Even here on Hacker News, mostly made up of people who put reason over emotion, have been extremely upset. One: Having the money taken broke people's faith in the greater good of humanity, so indignation naturally follows. Two: Diverting funds was akin to telling people what to do, and nothing makes people angrier than being forced to do things against their will.<p>People got very emotional over what, in perspective, isn't that much money. $625 could get you an iPad... or a really lousy computer.

Anything else is a function of people's perceptions (e.g. beauty is in the eye of the beholder.)<p>Lest we argue that red soles are aesthetically functional as well, regardless of the designer's intent, let's consider the possible repercussions of pink insulation when applied inside transparent walls. Or perhaps the calming effect the color has on installers. Now, the pink is functional. Does that make it less able to be protected?<p>I really think it goes back to the intent of the creator/designer/architect of the product. The designer of the shoes seems to have argued the aesthetic qualities of the color on the sole and therefore nullified his ability to claim the use of color was not ""functional.""

A Doors cover band in the Netherland used to have 'Jim' walking up on stage with a thick copy of Das Kapital open in his hand, but upside down to indicate the fakeness of that showing off behavior.<p>I've had guys quoting from Nietzsche (in horrible horrible German once) and according to every American movie and series ever made with high school kids in it, all people in the US can quote Shakespeare by heart and actually like it and find it romantic. Other countries (UK included) just don't have that kind of show off thing. Going to Paris is not intellectual per se, and holding a big book and learning some quotes from it is neither, so why does the US keep promoting that stereotype in everything it puts out? See a colored person on deathrow; watch carefully if he reads/quotes some crap poetry from some long death famous author and you, as the viewer of this B movie, know she/he isn't guilty! Ugh.<p>Sorry got a bit offtopic, just curious why this is :)<p>I understand the OP point about nothing being able to see and show what people are reading, but personally I would like to keep it that way so I can just read what I want without having to look like 'an intellectual'.",1313332004

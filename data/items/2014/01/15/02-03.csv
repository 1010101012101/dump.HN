7061371,comment,7059919,7060815,5,0,bottompair,,,"A few things I was thinking:<p>- Spreadsheets are prone to fat-fingering and messing up formulas. For example, if you built a spreadsheet with three product SKU&#x27;s and wanted to add a fourth, it&#x27;s not so easy. Especially if you have visualizations tied to specific ranges of cells, etc. With this app I can validate data once and not worry about some random missing formula screwing it up down the road.<p>- When creating models for comparison the typical pattern is Save As -> New. Before you know it, you&#x27;ve got 8 or 10 different spreadsheets with different variations on the numbers. Now add a new expense category to the model in spreadsheet #10. If you want to compare backwards to the rest you&#x27;ll need to do that work over and over (this is the pattern I was stuck in).<p>- Longer-term I wanted to be able to overlay models - sort of an A/B test given different configuration<p>- During the past few months I&#x27;ve met with countless entrepreneurs trying to launch startups pre-money. Most of them are trying to build models from scratch (or a template they found) and it&#x27;s been a clear pain point for them<p>- I can share models in a service like this easily. I&#x27;ve already used it several times when someone&#x27;s asked me to help validate their business model. I create the model in the app and send them a link. They can tweak it and show me their ideas. It&#x27;s crude right now, but collaboration between founders on something like this might be worthwhile.<p>- Even longer-term I&#x27;d like to add in more templates to support startups beyond the initial financial model. Basically I looked at my last several years&#x27; worth of operational spreadsheets from helping run SaaS companies and thought &quot;there ought to be an app for this&quot;.",1389754404

It offers a lot of rope for the self-hanging if you want, but the defaults (static, safe, strong, immutable, pure, lazy) are the best place to start.<p>There are a hundred things people think &quot;only dynamic languages can do&quot; that you can do in Haskell.<p>I have yet to get anybody to contrive something you can&#x27;t do in Haskell that you can in other languages.<p>This is a mere glimpse, but should give you an idea:<p><a href""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Data-Dynamic.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Data-Dy...</a><p>^^ Uni-typed languages are a subset of proper type systems. This is a practical application of that idea.<p>You don&#x27;t generally hack GHC unless you&#x27;re an enthusiast, although that option is certainly available to you and it&#x27;s much easier than you&#x27;d expect.<p>Negatives? More people using it would improve library coverage, but the libraries are <i>very</i> good. The web story is better than Clojure. Scala web vs. Haskell web entirely and utterly depends on whether you&#x27;re happy with Scala&#x27;s Play Framework or assorted uber-micro-frameworks. If you&#x27;re not and would prefer a more diverse and componentized ecosystem of libraries, Haskell&#x27;s is better. You <i>can</i> go whole-hog with a single framework like Snap or Yesod, but their individual components are eminently reusable libraries. Yesod even checks the damn URLs in your templates at build-time.<p>The interactive workflow in GHCi is legitimately better than Clojure&#x27;s. I&#x27;m not exaggerating. It&#x27;s not as good as the glory days of Common Lisp + swank + Emacs, but it&#x27;s better than Clojure + Emacs + nrepl.<p>Bonus? Has a fucking debugger - unlike Clojure.<p>Native binaries, multiple quality vector libraries that support CUDA. Burgeoning but respectable family of bioinformatics libraries.<p>Negatives? Forces you think and learn. There&#x27;s a ramp-up time, but the other side of the first hump or two has some pretty serious leverage. Doesn&#x27;t have the library diversity of Perl or Python, but the building blocks are incredible (Parsec, attoparsec, Aeson, etc).<p>Another negative? You&#x27;ll have even less patience with poorly designed static languages.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;d sooner use Clojure than OCaml, but I&#x27;d sooner use Haskell than Clojure.<p>I don&#x27;t fetishize type systems in general, I just really find Haskell very pleasing and productive.<p>The build tools are mature and quite nice now that Cabal has sandboxing built in by default. Put it this way, I don&#x27;t cringe at all when I use cabal the way I did with Scala&#x27;s sbt.<p>Another difference between Haskell and Scala is that it uses a relative conservative core augmented by potentially unsound/unsafe augmentations like GADTs. <a href""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GAD"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT</a><p>What this helps with is it means you only have to think about the &quot;core&quot; of the language at any given time, but if somebody is using magic like Template Haskell (macros), you get that documentation in the form of a pragma at the top of the file. I quite like it.<p>The laziness is also important, it obviates the need of 80-90% of how macros get used in languages like Clojure. It makes functions themselves more general and useful.<p>Another negative? A sufficiently &quot;specialized&quot; application of Haskell might mean you&#x27;re on the frontier. But the same is true of Clojure. I don&#x27;t find that really matters nor do I find the situation truly improves by using something like Java or Ruby.<p>I&#x27;d rather just read a white paper, sip tea, think, and then sit down to write the code in a language that won&#x27;t waste my time.<p>I would add that Haskell&#x27;s sweet spots extend from Java -> Python -> Clojure. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for systems programming - for that I&#x27;d use Rust.",1389754249

It was incredibly high bandwidth relative to the control plane, since it was completely optimized for moving data.<p>Back to Unix. Unix is designed for the control plane. It is not designed for rapidly moving large amounts of data with maximum efficiency. Why do we use it today for what are arguably &quot;data plane&quot; tasks? Well, when all you have is a hammer...<p>Nowadays, you can have both on the same machine: run Linux on the first core or two, and reserve the remaining cores for your app. Along with huge page allocations to reduce TLB impact, you can literally own all CPU activity on those cores, and lock all of your RAM too.<p>That app is a normal Linux app, but it runs on the raw hardware—like not having an operating system at all. When you also give your app complete control over the network hardware, you&#x27;ve completely bypassed the kernel.<p>With UDP, you don&#x27;t even need a networking stack, making this approach particularly attractive.

Experience is worth a lot, I suspect [1]. What I said was that <i>needing a higher salary</i> makes it a worse deal than <i>not needing it</i>. I think that was pretty clear. In fact, the next set of words after that snippet you quoted was:<p>> ; like you said, there are people your age (and presumably experience level) with war chests or breadwinning spouses<p>I was submitting that the choice between a 20-something with low salary requirements and an experienced hand with high salary requirements is a false one; i.e. the replacement ramen candidate may have equal experience. Lots of people are older and don&#x27;t need salaries, and <i>that&#x27;s</i> who you&#x27;re competing with for limited investor resources. I know plenty of those people; it sounds like you do too. There&#x27;s no law that says older people have to make more money.<p>And there&#x27;s a very good reason why an experienced entrepreneur who can afford it should take less salary; their company is more likely to succeed because those leftover resources can be applied to the company. It even shows up in the data! So that certainly explains a bias against salary needs.<p>> what&#x27;s happening is that they are being required to take on even more opportunity cost.<p>A separate point, but no investor cares how much opportunity cost you&#x27;re taking on because it doesn&#x27;t make the deal any better. There&#x27;s no fairness rule at play here. Having a higher salary at your current job may improve your bargaining position [2] for a deal the investor already wants to pursue, but a) giving yourself a better bargaining position does mean the deal is worse for the investor, and b) it sounds like you&#x27;re complaining that it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> improve your bargaining position, which sounds...good for the investor, no?<p>Best to stop think of your salary needs as some justified thing that flows naturally from your position of experience and should be somehow baked into the entrepreneurship process as a given, and start thinking of it as a exogenous negative you have to overcome with that experience and wisdom, not mention skill and hard work. Otherwise you end mispositioning your arguments like that.<p>[1] But don&#x27;t know. I will say it&#x27;s not some crazily hard calculation; for example, the analysis that came up with &quot;The lower the CEO salary, the more likely it is to succeed.&quot; could simply adjust for prior experience (i.e Is this negative correlation because of stupidly overpaid 23-year-olds or are people being paid according to their demands and that isn&#x27;t working out? Or maybe experience doesn&#x27;t matter at all?). Then we&#x27;d know. So in a sense I agree that&#x27;s an important question for investors to figure out (&quot;How do I weigh the negatives of salary versus the positives of experience?&quot;), just not the one I was addressing.<p>[2] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreemen"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiate...</a>",1389754088

7061256,comment,7057651,7058692,2,0,fingerprinter,,,">The coach/player metaphor is an extremely weak analogy for Software Engineering. Sports aren&#x27;t changing nearly as rapidly as software engineering is. If you don&#x27;t watch a soccer/basketball/football/baseball for 10 years and come back, it&#x27;s basically the same game. The last 10 years of software engineering have changed so much with mobile, map-reduce, responsive design, P/B/S/I/A - aaS offerings, dev-ops tools, cloud computing systems, new languages, etc...<p>Watching? perhaps. Coaching? No. And that is why I don&#x27;t think the analogy is weak.<p>I&#x27;m very familiar with two sports, basketball and football. I&#x27;m intimately familiar with football. The subtle changes that most fans, particularly casual fans, don&#x27;t see is what makes coaches who they are and what makes great coaches worth their weight in gold. Not to mention coaches that can get the most out of specific skillsets of players[1].<p>As just one example. The pistol became all the rage last year with several running QBs running it for their teams. The good teams could, for the most part, coach their players on this style of offense and how to counter it. It was a different style of offense that wasn&#x27;t used in the NFL and the teams and players had to react...the coaches had to to actually coach them on how to play the zone reads etc etc.<p>Even further, a coach has to be ready to adapt mid-game, mid-drive and in situations. Game conditions dictate them be ready for quite a bit and ready to coach up their players at an instant...or better still...have previously coached them on such a situation. The game, to the fan, might look the same, but not to the coaches.<p>This is why for people who are familiar with coaching and managing software, they do hold up. Both are at their core about leading a group of people to a common goal, articulating the goal, the way and (sometimes) the how.<p>So, in summation, you <i>still</i> don&#x27;t want your coach running routes. You want your coach getting ready for the game and coaching everyone in that manner.<p>[1] - I mentioned specific skillsets of players. The pistol was an example of this. You have young, inexperienced mobile QBs who can do a few things well. You adapt to their skills b/c you know, while they have potential, they don&#x27;t have Peyton Manning&#x27;s situational football IQ yet (if ever) and ability to read defenses. So you simplify, mold the system around their skills. Good managers do this with developers as well. A manager is not going to just &quot;off you go&quot; to a developer. They need to know strengths and weaknesses. Even with my experienced managers, directors and such, I have a firm grasp on personalities, trigger points, strengths and weaknesses.",1389752194

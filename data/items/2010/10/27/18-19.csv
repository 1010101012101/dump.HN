(Lazy, right?) My notes for Founders at Work, with an angle toward how to start and run a successful company, can be found here: https://docs.google.com/View?id=dhfmbkzv_58gqgg8nd5<p>Note that these notes are no substitute for reading the book; I'm sharing them as a companion while you read or a refresher afterward. Even though I said I'm too lazy to _re_read books, but you should definitely read this book at least once, _especially_ if you're a founder. The stories told are inspiring, and Jessica has a real gift for guiding the interviewee toward the most important or insightful moments of their startup days.<p>I have notes for about 15 other books, either startup or programming related. I think sharing these notes are covered under Fair Use, but every time I think I have an understanding of what Fair use actually is, I see someone get sued within that definition :( If anyone can spell out exactly whether what I have is fair use, I'd love to share the others. I'm sharing these Founders at Work notes because if Paul or Jessica disapprove: a) they can take down this post, and b) the advice in these notes seem to be mostly contained in Paul's essays, so I'm hoping it's not a big deal.

1839949,comment,1839611,1839753,0,0,bravura,,,"1) Pair-wise approaches, if I understand what you mean, are those in which you are look at pairs of examples. You want to avoid naive implementations, in which you train on a quadratic number of instances (all-pairs). It really depends upon the specific problem how you get around this. For example, if you have a model that operates over pairs, doing example selection in an intelligent way. For example, use all positive pairs, but sample only one negative pair per positive pair.<p>2) You are talking about the cold start problem. Basically, the problem is how do you deliver good recommendations to new users as quickly as possible. I am actually currently talking to a big company about this problem.<p>Google has talked about how they do this for Google News, especially because they have high item churn (news is not news in a day). <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.80.4329&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.80....</a> Essentially, they do clustering of users and news items.<p>Another approach is to give the user a hunch-like quiz when they join. Basically, you use a decision tree to cluster the users, getting as much information from them with as few questions as possible.<p>Another approach that requires almost NO user interaction is to use some ambient information about the user. Maybe you have a cookie for the user and other sites will share the user's behavior with you. Maybe you ask them to log in through facebook or twitter, and then can look at their profile and activity history to build a user profile. So getting creative about possible sources of ambient information is another approach.",1288205825

That works somewhat well, but breaks down for a couple cases. I still prefer a paper list where I can scribble new input as well, for meetings and offline / distraction-free planning time.

1839933,comment,1839781,1839854,0,0,treeface,,,"It depends on who you listen to. I spent a good 2 years post college building upon the foundations of finance, accounting (of all its various stripes), monetary theory, international factor movements, quantitative analysis (read: fairly high-level stats), portfolio theory (risk management), etc. Then you have to learn how to read SEC filings (and foreign versions of the SEC filings), what all of them mean, all the nuanced rules that the FASB puts out (in the form of GAAP) and how they differ from the international standards (in the form of IFRS), entire histories of companies down to the intensely nitty-gritty details...<p>The list is basically endless. The worst thing about it is that even after all this, something like 90% of portfolio returns can be attributed to sector allocation, meaning that even if you do think a company is great, they might just be the best answering machine company in an age that is on the cusp of seeing smartphones.<p>This is why you'll often find analysts focus specifically on sectors (or even industries), and only a few companies in them. It takes a <i>lot</i> of time to get enough information about the past, present, and (potential) future of an industry and a company in order to know all the factors to make an educated-enough guess.<p>In short, you can pick 30 stocks at random and you will probably have returns very close to market average returns. The amount of knowledge (and intelligence) required to guess better than other people is so immense, that unless you're going into financial analysis as a career, I'd stick to ETFs or managed portfolios. With an ETF, you can make bets on sectors, countries, or the entire market, all for minimal fees. People much more experienced than yourself will figure out what the best allocation of companies inside that particular ETF is.<p>Still, anything beyond a portfolio that is perfectly correlated with average market returns brings with it increased risk. In other words, the more you screw around on the edges without having the years of experience required to know what you're doing, the greater the chance you'll make higher (or lower) returns than the market.",1288205593

I don't think there's much in the way of general advice to give, for one.  Also, there's a whole industry based around that, and it's full of charlatans and snake-oil salesmen.

I've played my share of video games in life (My Civ III skills are pretty impressive), but at the end of the day, that's time that could have been better spent.

The only other program Princeton has is a 1-2 year (I forget) master's in public policy that I believe was secretly created because Uncle Sam wants a fancy school to send future generals to so they can class up their resumes and learn with some of the sharpest people around.  Princeton is one of the few elite schools that actively welcomes these soldiers too.  The one's I met while there as a student were incredibly smart.

But if you just want to get into any Ivy and you don't care which then all you really need 1250 SATs and no Cs. And even these are negotiable if you're really good.<p>Also, if you get recruited then they send your applications to admissions and tell if you're likely to get in or not before you even apply. And if you're not likely to get in then they'll tell you to go talk to folks at the other colleges because they don't want a bad reputation for future years. Because of this there will usually be at least one Ivy who needs what you have badly enough to pull some strings to get you in.<p>As for the violin, don't choose something like violin, gymnastics, or soccer where people start at age 3. Just choose some obscure instrument and you're pretty much guaranteed to at least be one of the best in your state in a couple years if you practice enough and get lessons. It's not like you need to be the absolute best, assuming each school takes on average 8 of X then you only need to be in the top 80. And remember that there will be a handful of those who are completely ineligible because of outright terrible grades or SATs, or else they just don't want to go to an Ivy, so really it's more like you only need to be in the top 96 or so.<p>Also there are a whole bunch of tricks. For example US News doesn't count the grades of people who come from Canada, so every year Harvard will recruit a whole bunch of folks from up there to round out whatever they need when if there aren't enough qualified US applicants. And plus most of these schools run massive direct mail campaigns encouraging every one to apply no mater how unqualified they are in order to make themselves appear more selective, so it's actually a ton easier to get in than it looks. Again you still need to be reasonably hard working and maybe a little lucky, but it's not so difficulty that you need to be obscenely lucky or genetically talented or whatever.",1288202847

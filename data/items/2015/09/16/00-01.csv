Though they spike infrequently, we know from intracellular recordings that they still receive inputs from other neurons, which causes their membrane voltages to fluctuate. The sum of these fluctuations and spikes constitute what’s commonly known as brain waves. Over the past 15 years scientists have begun to amass evidence that these brain waves play an active role in information processing, shunting some neural inputs while enhancing others, for example, or altering the timing of spikes. This suggests that spikes are not the sole information-carrying signal in the brain, and that, in turn, the “inactive” neurons are doing much more than it seems.",1442364875

None of the involved banks or brokers trusted that anyone else was actually being honest about LIBOR submissions or predictions.<p>Even if there were any system safeguarding LIBOR whatsoever, a blockchain wouldn&#x27;t have helped. The reason it was so easy to falsify your bank&#x27;s LIBOR submission was because they were essentially made up. Submitters produced the number by talking to brokers and then making a decision. A blockchain wouldn&#x27;t have made any difference. You&#x27;d put your submission on the blockchain, and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to change it later if things didn&#x27;t turn out how you liked, but you had made up the submission anyway. Nobody would ever be able to point to some number on the blockchain and say definitively that your reported LIBOR figure for today should have been X but in fact it was Y and therefore you&#x27;re a crook, because the figures were never verified. They&#x27;d only be able to say &quot;There&#x27;s no record, so you could easily have just made up the number,&quot; and you&#x27;d say &quot;I did make it up, that&#x27;s how you do it, everyone else made theirs up too,&quot; and that would pretty much be it. The only way to catch someone being dishonest was to find records of employees talking about it; the Hayes case and others like it are based on the fact that bankers incriminated themselves by discussing the manipulation with each other.<p>By contrast, when banks transfer specific quantities of money, they absolutely are not relying on a trust-based system. I owed you X, I sent you X, and I swear to God if you come to me later and say I only sent Y and I owe you more dosh there will be a fight. If you produce internal records kept by your accountants that say I totally only sent Y, no bank would take your word for it under any circumstances. Similarly, if there was a mixup and some of my assets ended up with you by accident, my chances of convincing you that I should get them back are nonexistent if I don&#x27;t have some outside system demonstrating that I&#x27;m not lying. In real life, financial institutions rely on third-party businesses to be that &quot;outside system.&quot; A blockchain would help solve our problem without those businesses. I wouldn&#x27;t need to trust you, the transaction would be recorded on our blockchain, and if either of us thought the other could falsify the blockchain we wouldn&#x27;t have agreed to use it. If the blockchain says I really didn&#x27;t send enough money, I&#x27;ll probably say something about a technical glitch and give you the cash while I grumble about how much I hate technology.

Most people wouldn&#x27;t, because new information in that category often threatens their world view.<p>I seek out information in a similar venn, but mine looks more like <i>Affects Your Life</i>, not <i>Aware Of</i>, but very <i>Interested In</i>. I&#x27;m not interested specifically in any particular topic, but I&#x27;m very interested in anything that challenges my current perception of the world, no matter where it comes from. As a result, I read a lot of blogs and twitter feeds written by people most would consider mentally deranged. Except they&#x27;re not mentally deranged; they&#x27;re often more rigorously logical than their detractors.<p>As for how to automate the task of finding this information, I have high hopes for machine learning and neural networking, but my own exploration of that area is in its infancy.",1442361971

Because African Americans have an average IQ of 85 and only 11-16% have an IQ > 100 (the national average).&quot;<p>As someone with an interest in this (both as an African and someone who measures freakishly high on IQ tests way beyond my actual abilities, joined MENSA on a lark), I’ve had this argument over and over again. Most of this goes back to the IQ statistics cited in “The Bell Curve” as applies to Africans. The “Bell Curve” was a Storefront tract dressed in respectable clothing (sadly, every 20 years it has a successor, the most recent is Nicholas Wade’s “A troublesome Inheritance&quot;. The statistic in question was quoted as an average IQ of 75 for Black Africans. If you read the citations, it comes from a study quoted by Richard Lynn (infamous racist, google ‘Mankind Quaterly’). It is based on a study done in South Africa in 1927 by the Boer Govt (it actually concluded that Bantu Africans has an IQ of 70 and was one of the intellectual foundations for Apartheid). I leave it as an exercise for people to figure out why that study might have been slightly biased.<p>Keep in mind that an IQ of 80 is borderline retarded. So to believe this you have to believe that almost every black person you run into is either borderline retarded or just above that.<p>Now, you’ve been down voted into the grey, which I think is good, but just in case people think you’re being down voted for being ‘politically incorrect’ rather than for being a racist, here are some recommended readings<p>Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do - Claude M Steele<p>The Bell Curve Wars: Race, Intelligence, and the Future of America - Steven Fraser (Editor)<p>The Mismeasure of Man - Stephen Jay Gould<p>The “people are where they are because of some innate fault” is a very attractive argument that has been used time and time again (I know I used it growing up upper middle class in a country with a lot of poor people. If only those people were hard workers like me and pulled themselves by their bootstraps). It is used time and time again against African Americans, and it is ironic to see it argued here in an article that is one of 2 (with the linked ’The Case for Reparations’) that clearly lays out the case as to why African Americans are disadvantaged in the U.S.<p>There are None so Blind as those who refuse to see.",1442361950

The articles described the activity of neurons in primary sensory areas: the neurons in cortex that receive direct input from the periphery, or at least are the closest to neurons in the periphery in terms of number of connections between them. One exception is the article she cites about the hippocampus, but this area is required only for <i>forming</i> memories--once the memories have formed, they live somewhere else, but probably not in the primary sensory areas. Okay, maybe memories are a distributed network that includes neurons in primary sensory areas...but it would be weird to also have the main sensory area also be the place where memories live.",1442361761

It was incredibly grainy, very low resolution (the video display was roughly the size of a postage stamp on my monitor), and the frame-rate wasn't much more than one fps.  It was unwatchable for more than a few seconds, other than as a curiosity.<p>There are now many websites I can go to watch video (live or archived) at a higher resolution than I used to watch ""real"" TV content at, and a comparable frame-rate.  Choice of content to watch is now almost unmeasurable, whereas it used to be I could count my options on the fingers of one hand.<p>Most of this progress is just due various forms of exponential growth and decay (cost of bandwidth and storage, speed of cpus, etc).  It was probably pretty easy to predict, but I wouldn't categorize the change as a mere bugfix.",1260824277

6094591,comment,6092155,6093842,1,0,droithomme,,,"Are you aware that disclaimers of liability are not considered valid contract terms in most scenarios and legal jurisdictions in western countries where software is likely to be used?<p>Do you believe that you can disclaim liability for negligence such as carelessness or a failure to thoroughly test? How about for intentional malicious acts? Courts in the US and commonwealth nations at least don&#x27;t allow such disclaimers. What about other sorts of liability? Do you know the differences between direct, consequential, special, incidental and indirect damages?<p>The reality is that in enough jurisdictions to matter, authors can be held legally liable for bad code they create no matter whether they have a liability clause as a condition of licensing or not. Forming an LLC or corporation won&#x27;t shield them either if someone wants to sue. The only protection in these cases is maintaining E&O insurance.<p>If I use GPL, BSD, or any other licensed code that disclaims liability, and the code is flawed because the author was negligent, I can sue the author for damages and I can win. The  disclaimer does absolutely nothing.<p>What purpose then is there in cluttering up licenses with useless clauses?",1374641780

The whole point of licenses is to be incompatible, if all licenses were compatible then we would only have one license.<p>I didn&#x27;t come up with this system, if you must blame something, blame copyright. If you think it&#x27;s bad this way, it&#x27;s even worse when the two licenses in question are proprietary; often times in that situation you won&#x27;t even have the option of a rewrite or a workaround. The nature of copyright is that not even free software licenses can give you the legal ability to do everything you could possibly think of doing, but they give you enough to ensure that every user is granted the four freedoms as long as the copyright holds.

6094570,comment,6094486,6094486,8,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think this is a good introduction to some of the depth of the problem. As with all big problems, you start by breaking them down into what you can and cannot do.<p>So in the field of package signing, you can, if you choose to, nominate a single signature authority. This is basically what Microsoft does, they are the signature authority for all keys that sign things that go into Microsoft products. When you choose a signature authority that becomes the first lemma in your calculus &quot;I trust <foo>.&quot;[1]  Now, once you have that lemma you can build on it with statements like, &quot;I trust Microsoft, and Microsoft trusts Dell, so I will trust that the key Microsoft says is Dell&#x27;s really is Dell&#x27;s.&quot;<p>Now you&#x27;ve created a transitive trust relationship, in that you not only trust Microsoft&#x27;s internal processes, but you trust that it will do a good job of auditing Dell&#x27;s before it gives its blessing to Dell.<p>Now Don makes a minor error when he says, &quot;PyPI allows anyone to sign up and make a release which makes verifying authors an unmanageable problem.&quot; the issue is that PyPI doesn&#x27;t create a durable relationship between people you trust and someone you don&#x27;t know.<p>Because of this you have to assume there are bad actors who are making packages and simply not install them. This isn&#x27;t an &quot;unmanageable problem&quot; this is &quot;inconvenient.&quot; (not being snarky, trying to be precise). You can run a grocery store where everyone puts the money they owe into the cash register before they leave there are no checks on the cash register, everyone is trusted to do the right thing. The store going out of business isn&#x27;t a &quot;problem&quot; it is the expected outcome. This comes up in policy debates as well where person A wants their free speech rights but they also don&#x27;t want person B to make remarks they consider to be hateful (thus impinging on person B&#x27;s free speech rights). Its the &#x27;incompatible constraints&#x27; problem.<p>There are a number of interesting zero knowledge proof techniques in cryptography, things which allow someone you know nothing about (zero knowledge) to prove they are a particular person, and starting from there you can create durable audit trails of actions (useful in digital cash systems among others) but it also allows you to identify bad actors, sadly after the fact, because you can make statements about the person who identified and the package they produced. You cannot say anything about motive (they may have built their package on a compromised machine) but you can trace back the action to where it entered the system, and with sufficient audit trails back it out of the system.<p>As you can imagine these systems are challenging to get right, challenging to build, and take an expertise that is generally highly valued so rarely available &quot;for free.&quot;<p>But working on challenging problems has its own rewards and so I recommend it highly. It is always a workable approach to start with assumptions (lay them out and keep them front and center) to gain an understanding of the more challenging aspects, and then work from there. Since you aren&#x27;t building life support systems you may find that just good auditing trails is enough if they allow you to back up to any previous state. Sometimes using a centralized authority gives you enough to build a system around it. I highly recommend Schneir&#x27;s &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot; for a pretty approachable take on these topics.<p>[1] People will attempt to derail this example with &quot;but I don&#x27;t trust Microsoft!&quot; or some such. Which is fine, pick an authority you do trust and use that as a place holder.",1374641170

6094544,comment,6093777,6094383,4,0,pudquick,,,"Thank you for the write up here.<p>I was going to post something similar, but instead use the example of a lawyer wanting to perform name searches on the list of people the NSA has information on.<p>One point I do want to make, though, for anyone that can&#x27;t tell the last paragraph might be a bit of a joke: while a Bloom filter never has false negatives, it will always have a certain amount (controllable by adjusting the size of the filter) of false POSITIVES.<p>Think of it this way: a Bloom filter lets you determine with 100% accuracy if someone is a member of Group A (the set you build the filter with) but less than 100% accuracy if they&#x27;re instead only a member of Group Not-A.<p>In the example above, if Group A is the Evil Terrorists (which you build the Bloom filter with), then there&#x27;s a non-zero chance that a Good American member of Group Not-A may end up falsely identified as a terrorist.<p>If Group A is instead made up of every Good American, you flip the problem and now have the non-zero possibility of falsely identifying a Evil Terrorist (from group Not-A) as a benign Good American.<p>If you attempt to use them to solve a problem like this, you have to have a mechanism in place to deal with the very real case of a false positive (or decide which group to build the filter with - which one is less damaging to have show up as a false positive).<p>Bloom filters are cool, but they&#x27;re a tradeoff of speed and memory for accuracy. They are not a perfect index if you&#x27;re trying to determine A vs. Not-A-ness. The best concept is a cache lookup - if it&#x27;s not a member of the Bloom filter, you DEINITELY don&#x27;t have it cached, but if there&#x27;s a hit then you very very very likely have it cached (and if you don&#x27;t, then at least you&#x27;re only redirecting a vanishingly small number of false positives back to the live server).<p>Google actually uses this for determining attack sites in Chrome without giving out an index of all the attack sites they know of. They give out a Bloom filter instead with the web client. When you visit a site, if it&#x27;s a miss on the Bloom filter, it is currently not known by Google to be an attack site. However, if you get a hit, it first calls home to a Google server to re-verify that the site is not a false positive and confirm it is indeed an attack site. In this way, since the vast majority of the web is not malicious, they only impose a bandwidth cost when they think you may have stumbled upon a bad site (member of the Bloom filter) - but they get a chance to weed out the false positives before telling you.",1374640530

As in &quot;the defendant wrote software...&quot;  Makes for a compelling narrative doesn&#x27;t it?  But the truth is, Daniel Stenberg wrote the software and included this feature for a reason.  Was that reason to assist users with criminal intent?  C&#x27;mon.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think of all the many sources of exposed email addresses on the internet, whether they are exposed through ambivalence toward users&#x27; privacy or simply incompetence (as with AT&T).<p>Such sources are constantly mined by email marketers.  WHOIS data comes to mind.  Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but the information this defendant accessed was nothing more than email addresses.  Is that right?<p>How many businesses on the web fail to adequately protect their customers&#x27; email addresses?  Many more than just AT&T.  And how many businesses sell their customers&#x27; email addresses to email marketers?  Doesn&#x27;t AT&T require customers to opt out lest their email address and other personal info be shared with AT&T &quot;marketing partners&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised.<p>I have no opinion on the guilt or innocence of this defendant.  Maybe he deserves to be prosecuted.<p>But anyone with half a brain should be disturbed that a CFAA prosecution can proceed on a set of facts such as these.  AT&T had to literally create &quot;damage&quot;, by racking up a $7000 postage bill.  Did the defendant &quot;cause&quot; money to be spent on postage?  No, that expense was caused by AT&T&#x27;s carelessnes in exposing email addresses and their subsequent decision to notify customers of their mistake by postal mail.  Whatever happened to mitigation of damages?<p>I guess there&#x27;s probably much I don&#x27;t understand about this case.  But reading the brief, the interpretation of the statute sounds incredibly one-sided.  With this sort of loose interpretation, how can anyone defend himself against a CFAA prosecution?<p>If a party wants to claim some access to their computer was &quot;unauthorized&quot;, then maybe they need to set up a proper mechanism for authorization.  Usually, that&#x27;s a password.  The URL&#x27;s this defendant accessed, where he found email addresses, were not password protected.  Putting confidential information at URL&#x27;s that you don&#x27;t think anyone will guess does not seem to me to be a proper system for authorization.  Claiming that anyone who stumbles on these URL&#x27;s is making &quot;unauthorized&quot; access seems a like a weak argument.  Apparently it&#x27;ll do just fine.",1374640418

Both of which will operate with 2W of power.<p>Its a difference of scale. GPUs focus more on SIMD instructions, because graphics are innately matrix-based operations that very easily translate into SIMD. But if you are going to be doing unique operations per core (ie: lots and lots of branching on a single work-item), then Paralella&#x27;s approach would give better performance.<p>So... yes... I over-simplified earlier, and got a few numbers wrong. But the concept is the same. Epiphany has no SIMD units at all, and each core instead focuses entirely on single-threaded performance. (at best, 2 Floating Point operations per clock with the super-scalar architecture). This makes it slower in the strictest sense... but &quot;more agile&quot;, and able to handle branches and conditionals better than the GPUs.<p>Also, remember that Epiphany works with only 2W of power... while a GPU like the AMD 7970 works with something like 300W of power. So of course, the 7970 is going to do more (especially with faster GDDR5 RAM and a PCIe x16 connection feeding it). So it isn&#x27;t really a fair comparison there either.<p>Nonetheless, Epiphany does see a few situations where it might perform better than a classic CPU and better than a classic GPU.

An office staffer will answer the phone (or sometimes just a voicemail box), sort the letters, and go through emails, responding with a form reply, if anything.<p>What those staffers will hand your legislator, likely, is a tally of how many notes and calls they received from X number of constituents on Y different issues. That summation, however, is what&#x27;s powerful. In a legislator&#x27;s very busy day, these briefs are easy to digest and send the most black-and-white picture of what his voters believe.<p>So yes, your letters and phone calls matter. In aggregate. JUST LIKE VOTES!&quot;",1374639450

6094462,comment,6091171,6091171,5,0,jliptzin,,,"A very well-written and judicious obituary of Facebook Platform. I started building for it shortly after it launched, in late 2007. I had high hopes for it; I felt I was at the forefront of &#x27;the next big thing,&#x27; like others, so I invested a lot of my time into it. I made apps that served millions of people, one of which reached #1 in DAU at one point among all apps (back when they ranked apps by DAU).<p>As a lone developer keeping up with the changes and additions wasn&#x27;t easy - I literally ran the gamut - from FBML to FBJS to FQL to xd_receiver.htm to the JS SDK to FB Credits to Graph API. Initially I cut them some slack - it was a new platform, and we all make mistakes.<p>But things never really got better. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how many times I came across 4, 5, 6 different ways to do the same (seemingly simple) interaction with the platform, only one of which worked, and of course not the officially documented method. Or inaccurate or nonexistent API docs. Or how many times my app would suddenly break without pushing any changes - I became accustomed to just waiting it out until Facebook would release a patch for whatever they broke, and have to tell my users to just wait it out. This would usually occur Tuesday night/Wednesday if I remember correctly.<p>Solutions to problems would usually lie in an obscure forum post after about 10 minutes of googling, posted by another friendly developer who probably tore his hair out looking for a solution. Ah, the camaraderie. Here&#x27;s a recent one I just came across (and they&#x27;re not hard to find) <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16649634/ios-url-scheme-fb-event-llu-no-longer-working-in-6-1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16649634/ios-url-scheme-f...</a>\nAccepted answers that start with &quot;Facebook seems to have...&quot; and end with &quot;change or remove them completely at will&quot; tend to give developers more than a few gray hairs.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that Facebook tends to treat developers like sheep. At first this didn&#x27;t bother me - after all, they weren&#x27;t forcing me to build apps for them, and I was free to leave at any time. In the early days I&#x27;d contact developer support (I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a published number) to report bugs/issues, suggest improvements, or genuinely ask for help with a problem. I never got a single non-automated response. Not once. So I stopped wasting my time and just became more and more bitter with every breaking change.<p>The 30% credits tax was the inflection point of the downfall. IMHO, that was a &quot;me too&quot; response to Apple&#x27;s iOS platform (coincidence that they came up with the same fee structure?) and was, for me, the tell-tale sign that they were no longer interested in their developers&#x27; well being. Yes, I understand they need to make money. I am all for ringing the cash register. But Apple and Facebook are different platforms. Apple has a highly trafficked worldwide app store. They let me put my app icon on my users&#x27; home screens (that&#x27;s valuable real estate), and I could push out unlimited notifications to my users&#x27; devices to keep them engaged and coming back with one click, among other things. Facebook has no such equivalents. I guess you could argue you&#x27;re paying for the viral distribution, but after they&#x27;ve heavily curtailed their viral channels and people have become more and more immune to app invites, there&#x27;s really no way to get free distribution anymore from Facebook. You still need to be buying ads, mostly from them.<p>If they wanted to make money and curtail spam, all they had to do was charge developers by each notification, invite, or newsfeed post they&#x27;d send out. Set a fixed price per message, or use a competitive auctioning system like adwords. The crapplications would never be able to afford their own spam.<p>I&#x27;ve since migrated my apps away from Facebook, either to mobile or on standalone web sites. Needless to say, my life as a developer has gotten a lot easier, and since I have more time to focus on improving my apps rather than keeping up with breaking changes, I&#x27;m doing better than I ever have before.",1374638701

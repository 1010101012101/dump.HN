2932613,comment,2927784,2931385,2,0,Goladus,,,"> I think it is useful to distinguish work from difficulty. IMO, on current hardware, writing a compiler is easy and,  for most languages, not too much work.<p>I disagree, writing a compiler is a lot of work, it's just easy work for people with experience.  An expert climber might climb a modest mountain in 6 hours where a novice might take all day and, assuming they don't get lost, still only make it halfway up before turning back.<p>Put yourself at the keyboard of someone who has never written a lexer.  This programmer's idea of text processing is to use find-and-replace, shell globs, or maybe an ad hoc regex with grep or perl.  They are used to programming sorting algorithms or writing polymorphic triangles and squares that inherit from the shape class.  Their idea of a hard programming assignment is to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem with dynamic programming, where, as hard as it may be, the answer is still just a couple of functions.<p>They have to write code to accept the <i>entire</i> character set.  Every single one of the letters, numbers, special characters and whitespace that is valid in the language must be handled, or else the lexer isn't going to work properly.<p>You have to write code to recognize every single keyword, distinguish identifiers from literals and different types of literals from each other; and you must drop comments.  Generally it's a good idea to also tokenize every single operator.  Even small languages can easily have dozens of keywords and operators, plus a number of different types of literals, many of which the programmer may have never used before  (Bit shift?  Octal literals?).  This means writing the lexer will involve frequent references to a language specification they have no experience reading.<p>And that's just the lexer, easily the most straightforward part of the initial phases.<p>This seems like nothing to someone who has done it before but I assure you it is not for a novice.  While none of it is supremely difficult, indeed many algorithms are much more difficult conceptually than any one piece of a lexer, there are a lot of little details that must be addressed and it's a lot of grunt work if you have no practice doing it.<p>If you read the Crenshaw tutorial, you'll see that he chooses a language that does not require much (any) work to lex.  The language you learn to compile has no whitespace and uses single-character keywords and identifiers.  This lets him delay lexing to chapter 7, but as you can see for yourself-- that chapter is pretty long-- 2300 lines and a lot of it is code.",1314481616

2932610,comment,2932331,2932476,7,0,mechanical_fish,,,"A lot of it is about brand. First impressions matter.<p>I'm old enough to remember when Facebook launched with an actual emphasis on privacy. You couldn't even join Facebook as a random person from off the street -- you had to be a Harvard student, then a college student, then a student of some kind. It took some time for the service to open up to the general public at all. Then even at that point (as far as I can tell; I was never much of a Facebook user) your content was more restricted to your immediate circle of friends than it is today. And, of course, friend lists were naturally smaller in those days. When Facebook changed their privacy defaults, it tended to happen gradually, without much fanfare except for revolts among the relatively small number of cognoscenti who knew about the obscure settings screens that most users never even visit.<p>In other words, Facebook successfully seduced people into trusting them, by starting out smaller and more constrained than they are today, and by almost always speaking with a human voice -- generally, the voice of your good friend who has just invited you to Facebook.<p>Google, on the other hand, started out as the friendly-but-distinctly-nonhuman omniscient robot who has read everything and indexed everything and can answer any question about anything. Then it watched all our YouTube videos and scanned all our books and memorized all our maps, and it helpfully filed all our email for us, and it got some spy satellites and photographed all of our backyards, and it grew eyes and drove around the city capturing pictures of our buildings (along with the occasional embarrassed passerby).<p>And only then, after it had established a very strong reputation as the super-powerful arbiter of all world knowledge, including knowledge of every one of us, did the Googlebot throw a party, invite us, and ask us all -- using a voice carefully designed by a team of top-notch professionals -- to be its friend. And to speak clearly into the microphones, so that the after-party analysis team can get a clear transcript of everything we say.<p>It's all in the delivery.",1314481575

But worse, it doesnt even get close to the root-cause for why Apple may decline in the post-Steve Jobs era.<p>Steve Jobs' greatest accomplishments are not Apple I, Apple II, Mac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone or iPad. It's Apple, itself.<p>Depending on how one tallies, Apple has been through three successful major technology and business transitions, combined with three minor ones within the Mac family, and two minor ones within the iOS family: Apple II > Mac [Mac (68K) > Mac (PowerPC) > Mac (OS X)] > Mac (Intel)] > handhelds [iPod > iTouch(iOS) > iPhone (iOS) > iPad (iOS)]. Combine that with the development of new business/sales platforms (virtual Apple Store, physical Apple Stores, iTunes, App Store, etc.) that enhance the consumers Apple experience. Each one of these required the insight to recognize a particular opportunity (and the discipline to ignore others), the investment of resources to develop those opportunities, and wherewithal to follow through on the execution, even if that means cannibalizing from the sales of incumbent products. Without these pivots, Apple would not be in dominating position it is in today.<p>Consider that companies with longevity are able to execute strategic pivots when required. IBM is an example of a tech company that has done so at least four times over its long, 100+ year old history. Apple has done three within 30 years.<p>What is the one link between the major initiatives? They all occurred while Steve Jobs was in a position where he could significantly influence Apple. It is interesting to note that two significant new Apple tech platforms that failed - the Apple III and Newton - and the one significant new Apple business platform that failed - licensing Mac clones - were not initiatives that Jobs was affiliated with.  (Before moving on, lets acknowledge that the Lisa failed under Jobs purview, and that the 68K > PowerPC transition was successful carried out during his absence,)<p>We see how Apple's success if predicated on an ability to pivot to address new opportunities in the market, even if those opportunities cannibalize an existing profit center. Jobs value to Apple extends beyond being a visionary, design auteur, or talented business negotiator.

(Neither the original article nor the IBM press release at <a href=""http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/35251.wss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/35251.wss</a> talk much about it. The videos on the SyNAPSE website are also pretty distilled.) A biological synapse does, in a sense, serve as one of thousands tiny memory units on a neuron. But they are more capable than a single bit. A packet of neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft does activate the synapse, but the synapse itself (technically, the post-synaptic group of neurotransmitter receptors) responds in a graded (i.e., a non-binary) manner, strongly dependent on a) its recent history of activation, b) other synaptic activations in the vicinity, and c) and the local biophysical environment. I think I'd want at least 8 bits for the signal amplitude plus a few more to store some associated state variables.<p>I'd guess that the IBM team would have to replicate a lot of that ""hardware"" to get the emergent behavior of a piece of cortex. I do know that computational neuroscientists have struggled for the last 15 years or so get reduced neuron models (i.e., point neurons with a small number of rudimentary synapses) to even crudely mimic full-featured neurons. It looks like this group recognizes this issue in that they are already starting with many hundreds of synapses.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that a processor inspired by brain hardware will be most likely very efficient in the tasks a mammalian brain is good at (pattern recognition, pattern completion, pattern separation, etc.), but will concomitantly be worse at things that a standard serial instruction processor excels at. I'd bet that the IBM folks are looking to merge a cognitive processor and a classical processor into a single unit.<p>Also, I know very little about compilers, assembly language, and other close-to-the-metal issues, but it appears that this processor would be <i>very</i> different to program.",1314480645

What information we did have (e.g. where the enemy is, how to cut stone and build bridges) was guarded either by force or by complexity of replication.

I think a movement to get internet to 'everyone, everywhere' needs to happen along side this internet education movement to be as potentially world-changing as I'd like to imagine it. Not that the education movement alone isn't great, there is a huge gap between being able to afford high-speed internet and affording/getting into a good college.",1314479014

2932475,comment,2932331,2932331,17,0,timsally,,,"Schmidt gets lambasted by the media every time he says something pragmatic about Google's services. I respect him for sticking to his guns. Here is a quote from Schmidt about Google Search that he got crucified for two years ago:<p><i>Judgement matters... If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place... If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines - including Google - do retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities.</i><p>What he said two years ago about Google Search, and what he is trying to say now about Google+, is that these services are not for those with high security and privacy needs. And he's right; they aren't. As a US company, Google must conform to US law. This means Google must store certain information and under various circumstances provide the police and the government with said information. You really think Google+ allowing you to use a pseudonym would then make it ok for use by those with strong anonymity requirements? Absolutely not.<p>EDIT: Please see jrockway's comment for a correction. Google is not legally required in the US to store information; still, they are in the EU. In any case, they are legally required to provide information they <i>do</i> have in many situations. Google chooses to retain some information in order to produce a more competitive product. This is how Google chooses to do business and it would be silly for those with strong anonymity requirements to use Google's services.",1314478904

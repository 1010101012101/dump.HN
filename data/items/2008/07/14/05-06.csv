When it comes to colocation it seems there is no standard pricing, its how well you can negotiate.<p>To kick it off, I have a half rack at AIS in San Diego and pay $125/Mbps. AT&T quoted me $500/Mbps unless I committed to 20Mbps at which point they might consider a price closer to $200/Mbps.<p>I also have a server at a friends rack at AT&T and they have an impressive data center.",1216014552

Digg has a much better mix of homepage stories (not very fresh though, I will admit that).<p>The posters on digg are considerably smarter then those on reddit. (I know that's not the popular perception, but that's what I've found.)<p>But reddit has one main thing going for it: it's about 1 thousand times faster to load. (Not an exageration - digg's home page takes about 15 to 30 seconds to render, compared to a fraction of a second for reddit. Comment pages can take several minutes, vs again, a fraction of a second on reddit.)<p>I've given up on both: reddit for the sheer stupidity, and digg because it's just too slow.",1216014003

I do enjoy merely studying the system, but they're really meant to be used, not just read.  Unfortunately for the left-handed, due to its era this book makes no allowance for chirality.  If you're a lefty who furthermore hooks your hand over to write, well...<p>Once, men and women of letters took joy in writing and in penmanship and wrote much.  Today, especially in the sciences, we find writing tedious, excuse our poor handwriting and avoid it when we can.  Perhaps the cycle started before the era of the computer, when the joy of penmanship was drained out of our learning of writing.<p>Here's a few videos of experts by way of an antidote:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C09ebUBAd_s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C09ebUBAd_s</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFs84W50kzc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFs84W50kzc</a><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjUQ4CckYNU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjUQ4CckYNU</a> (left-handed!)",1216013767

People working in those ""get it"".  I think it's harder for someone who has a ""normal job"" and is trying to cope with being resolved to be a ""startup girlfriend"" (rather than say, a film director or writer or whatever).",1216013607

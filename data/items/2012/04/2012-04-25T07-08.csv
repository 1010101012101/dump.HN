It can set the exposure length to anything less than the frame rate minus the time to read the sensor.  So at 48fps, the exposure can be 1/48 second minus the time to read the sensor, which is approximately equal to 1/48th of a second.<p>A film camera cannot do this because there must be time to move the film around, and so the standard design creates 24 frames per second, with 1/48th of a second to physically move the film, and 1/48th of a second to expose the film.  Of course you could expose the film for less than 1/48th of a second, but that would create the problem you originally mentioned.<p>My point is that the RED camera at 48fps with the ""shutter"" always open, you have the same exposure length (and motion blur) as a standard film camera.",1335340252

3888112,comment,3886787,3886787,5,0,malandrew,,,"The best definition of a startup I've heard is ""a temporary organization working together in search of a business model""<p>With that in mind, investors are investing in a temporary organization in search of a business model. Late state investors may invest after that temporary organization either has a business model or is about to establish one and  really early investors may put there money in before any business model has been discovered. Whatever the case may be, it's an exploratory effort that investors are part of.<p>If the entrepreneurs are fully capable of building a sustainable business, but never discovered a sustainable business model, then the investors, as agents that both advise and help with issues like recruiting talent, are as culpable for any failure to achieve that goal. Founders are putting in their time at below market rates (an opportunity cost whereby they aren't participating in other potentially lucrative ventures) and investors are putting in their money (an opportunity cost where the money invested can't be applied to other lucrative ventures.<p>Both have a claim to the business model generated. Entrepreneurs pay for their claim with time. Investors do it with the money that enable the entrepreneur to put in that time.<p>Now, IMHO, where acquit-hires come into play and how they can be split up fairly is to divvy up the grants and benefits by who brought who into the organization.<p>If investors put dumb money into the organization to find a business model that was never found, they have very little they can claim. If however, you have smart investors with solid connections that contributed highly to the creation of the organization established, they could make a case that they contributed significantly in the value being purchased by the acquirer.<p>The fair thing to do would be to ascribe a significant portion of the bonuses and grants according to the golden handcuffs applied and to divvy up the rest of the pot among those people most responsible for creating the organization.<p>If I was responsible for 90% of the recruiting in my organization, I don't think it's fair for any investor to think they have some claim to that value that was largely generated via networking extra-temporary organization. If, however, one or more of my investors contributed a large portion of their social capital to bring talent to my business, they've invested a non-tangible in the business that they deserve to be compensated for.<p>Money is invested in a business model. If the business model succeeds, you deserve a part of that.<p>Social capital is invested to build an organization of talent. If you, whether entrepreneur or investor, contributed social capital to the business to attract that talent, you deserve a part of that. The only exception that is just that I can see would be where the startup paid well over the market rate to attract the talent. In this case the recruiting incentive used to grow the company was not the people, opportunity and problem being solved but simply cash exchanged for a mercenary activity. In this case money, and not social capital, contributed to the growth of a valuable organization, and investors could make claim to the returns.<p>My question is the following: Of all the acqui-hires we've seen in the past few years, how common is it for those teams to stay together as a smaller organization within the larger acquiring organization.<p>If teams generally don't stay together 6 months to a year after an acqui-hire, then the value created it not in the professional relationships (edges) of the acquired organization, but in the people (nodes). If the value is in the nodes, all the value belongs to the individual employees and not to the organization.",1335339772

3888055,comment,3885198,3885568,1,0,zvrba,,,"> most undergrads get into CS to write software, not to learn ""theory"" or ""compiler design""<p>The flip side is also that an undergraduate enrolls into a CS class, <i>discovers</i> (so it's not their bag before enrollment) that ""compiler design"" is far more exciting and intelectually challenging than developing typical business/CRUD apps, only to find out after graduation that such jobs barely exist. Yes, let's dispense with academic CS departments.<p>Maybe the message you tried to convey is that attending mediocre CS courses is much worse than attending good SE courses. That I agree with, but I do not agree that SE should be totally devoid of theory.",1335337820

If I'm using my phone, someone else can use the ipad. I can also talk on the phone while browsing on the tablet. Two devices is a good thing for me. The weight of both is negligible, so I'm not worried about carrying both around.<p>Additionally, there is something to be said for the convenience of having a big screen to view things on. If I'm reviewing comps, it's a lot easier on the ipad precisely because of the 10"" screen.",1335337573
3888049,comment,3887548,3887942,1,0,the_bear,,,"Thanks, I'm glad you like the site! You make a lot of good points. Here are some thoughts/questions:<p>Regarding adding social proof to the site, I'm thinking that the non-post pages need a slightly different sidebar with an extra box forsocial buttons. The posts themselves have four social buttons on the left, so you see how many people like the post rather than how many people like our Facebook page. Do you think it would be overkill/confusing to have both on the same page?<p>I definitely agree that the date archives aren't all that useful for most people. I know a lot of sites have those and I'm guessing that it's so there's an easy way for someone to browse every post from the beginning of the site. This would only appeal to the most obsessed readers, so maybe it's better to just leave that out. To be honest, almost no one clicks on the archives so that's not near the top of my list of things to address, but I'll definitely keep your advice in mind for when I get to it.<p>As for the CMS, it's a homemade system. I know most people think it's crazy not to use an existing CMS like WordPress, but I like working on little side projects like this. It also made it really easy to build some cool customization like the recipe printing feature. You're right that I made a mess of the permalinks. That format is a holdover from a much earlier version of the CMS that I didn't bother to improve before launching The Yummy Life. I've added that to my list of things to address in the future.<p>Thanks again for all the feedback!",1335337560

I was also not trying to belittle Apple fans or customers of any of the other big name manufacturers.<p>I also really like OS X. As a FreeBSD user for many years, seeing OS X be successful is even a little gratifying because I know there&#x27;s a lot of cross-pollination going on behind the scenes. I&#x27;m not a mobile/laptop kind of guy, but  did use a MBP for a couple of years and it was without question the nicest laptop I&#x27;ve ever used. If I were to buy a laptop today it would probably be a Macbook Pro.<p>I&#x27;ve been building computers from parts for 30 years. I enjoy the research, part selection and construction aspect of the process. I like that I can go into the process with a specific set of criteria and come out with something that satisfies them exactly or, barring that, that I&#x27;m in control of the compromises. I like that if these criteria change or I find I made a mistake (more likely), I can just swap out a part and continue on. This <i>is</i> possible with most of the name-brand PC desktops, less so with the Apple products, but I like building it all myself the most.<p>Also, as a FOSS user, it&#x27;s typical for hardware support to be an issue. Sometimes it feels like various industries either do not care about me as a user or actively want me to suffer; constructing a modern PC that doesn&#x27;t have support issues is a challenge that brings a small amount of satisfaction when overcome. I understand if people think this is silly.<p>So, I consider myself an enthusiast. Given this explanation, hopefully my original comment makes more sense.",1389790794

(12 pence to a shilling and 20 shillings to a pound).<p>It&#x27;s interesting to me that both duodecimal and decimal counting are recommended as being easy to calculate with.<p>The benefits of decimal come from our using base-10 for other purposes. I guess the best of all possible worlds would be to use duodecimal for <i>all</i> units (including our normal number system).<p>Then we&#x27;d get the ease of use of modern base-10 units <i>plus</i> the better factorisation of duodecimal.<p>(But we&#x27;d still have an impedance mismatch with the binary powers.

Seriously.\n> Why is it that so few schools teach children how to speak in public?\n> It is not difficult, all you need is a debating society.<p>Speech and Debate was, by far, the class in high school that has done more for me than any other class.  The ability to stand up in front of people and start speaking is powerful.  The ability to think of a topic and speak interestingly for 10 minutes on the subject is powerful.<p>Doesn&#x27;t matter that I still have to remind myself to slow down or stop pacing or make eye contact or whatever else.  People ask me how I learned to do that, and I always tell them about my Speech and Debate class.<p>The Foreign Extemporaneous Speaking I did during debate events in high school was wonderful.  I still remember may favorite comment on a judges sheet.  They&#x27;d told me that when I started speaking and shared my position, they disagreed immediately and thought I was wrong, but after those seven minutes, I&#x27;d completely changed their mind.  That, for me, was the highest praise I could obtain.<p>Today, the ability to speak in front of people on the spot makes me more confident to speak up.  It makes me more confident in so many areas of my life.  I agree, schools fail to recognize how important that skill is.  They don&#x27;t realize how often it becomes useful in one&#x27;s life.<p>I was lucky. My school wasn&#x27;t the largest, but we had a full debating team, and frequently attended events throughout the year.  But yeah, spot on.  Get your kids into speech and debate.  It will serve them the rest of their lives.",1389790424

7063006,comment,7057713,7062915,5,0,exDM69,,,"> That isn&#x27;t true. Mozilla likes the situation. That is why they are pushing Javascript so damn hard: as the only language for the web, as the only language for apps, as the only language your phone can run, as the only language your tablet can run and so on. If Mozilla disliked Javascript why would they create an operating system that forces you to use Javascript? None of the backwards compatibility concerns apply there.<p>What options does Mozilla or any other individual company have here? I think that if they were truly happy with JavaScript, they wouldn&#x27;t be putting effort into ASM.js and Rust?<p>Mozilla isn&#x27;t really pushing JavaScript as the &quot;only language for the web&quot;, but they probably are recognizing the fact that they are unable to kill JavaScript or even provide an alternative because that would require all major browser vendors to co-operate (which is not impossible) and all the users to upgrade their browsers (which seems to be impossible judging by the popularity of old browsers like ie6, ie7).<p>What comes to Firefox OS, it&#x27;s perhaps a little awkward choice but they are trying to leverage existing web based technologies. Starting from scratch and introducing a new environment with a new programming language would set them behind in terms of time to market and money required to develop the system.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen anyone from Mozilla saying out loud that they love JavaScript and they think it&#x27;s the way forward.<p>> It&#x27;s just politics and a power grab. If all user facing software has to run inside the Javascript sandbox then the people that control that sandbox are given massive power.<p>While this is not entirely impossible, I think the real reason is that there is a JavaScript legacy and abandoning it would be expensive. And Mozilla has invested years of effort and tons of money in making the &quot;web platform&quot; better.<p>Your impression of this situation is different from mine, and neither of our opinions really matter. You should probably refrain from pushing your personal views as if they were facts.",1389789991

That is to say, you wouldn&#x27;t want to give your grandmother the flu when you went home for the holidays.<p>With H1N1, there is actual risk of serious illness or death for young, healthy people. Public awareness of this is key in increasing vaccination rates.<p>Even without H1N1, the US government is pushing flu vaccines hard for everyone [1]. Apart from a few very rare contraindications, pretty much everyone is eligible for a flu vaccine. There are essentially no serious side effects.<p>So, you should get your flu shot.<p>1: The government&#x27;s goal is to have 90% of 18-64 year olds vaccinated for seasonal influenza by 2020 (<a href""http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/objectiveslist.aspx?topicid=2"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/objec...</a>).

And, since the women are an important component of dating sites, it&#x27;s probably important to take that into consideration when designing such sites.<p>If you&#x27;re happy being a bit more stoical about the problems you&#x27;ve encountered, that&#x27;s fine.

The wealth of the world being held by a relative few seems to be a problem with our economic system, not the educational system. For example, using monetary wealth as a measure of ones education would imply that Bill Gates has literally a million times better education than I do. You could make arguments, but it seems likely that while he may have started out with certain skills that were better than my own, he also benefitted from some amount of luck and the momentum that seems to be generated by the formation of a corporation that has some initial success.<p>With regard to getting young people the right training, yes I agree. I don&#x27;t think the purpose of school should be job training. It should be learning how to learn, how to critically think, and how to develop ones own viewpoint on the world. That being said, a lot of students can greatly benefit from finding an area of interest (that may not be available at school) that inspires them to learn and becomes the catalyst for increased effort towards their education in general.<p>It sounds like you feel strongly about this topic. I&#x27;d encourage you to get involved in fixing this problem. A lot of schools these days are looking for &quot;industry mentors&quot;.

That brief experience was a valuable lesson and taught me how not to talk to women.<p>Still, I&#x27;m very much a typical horny male – it often takes no more than about 2 seconds to go from noticing a woman anywhere to mental procreative scenery. For all the feminist talk about the female libido, I doubt women generally experience as strong (or perhaps &quot;swift&quot; is a better word here) urges as many men seem to do. This discongruence is perhaps one of nature&#x27;s cruelest jokes... The question is how to avoid demonising (all) men without victimising women.<p>However, before this whole discussion turns into another bitter (anti-)feminist warzone, this particular case has probably at least as much to do with the medium as it has with issues between men and women. As it stands, the (unwalled) internet is generally somewhat of a lost cause since the distance, anonimity and lack of social consequences make it very hard to compel people to do the right thing – at least according to current societal norms.<p>If you prefer the wild west over the walled gardens of strictly regulated sites (block, ban, ignore, real ID), I&#x27;m afraid you better bring a gun to handle the coyotes... Not many seem to be in favour of policies such as Real Name or let alone forms of official identification.",1389788774

If you want to intern at linkedin, then you probably have to apply to head office, and probably then intern at head office. But at a small company, if you convince the chief engineer you are in.<p>I got my start at 14 knocking doors on a local industrial estate. I came across a little company developing java accelerator chips for mobile phones. Later they got bought by arm, and that technology became jazelle, which I guess opened the way for running Android on a little mobile proccessor, but when I was there it was 10 guys in a lab.<p>The CEO liked my enthusiasm, but I was pretty useless. On my first day, I tripped the power for the building, and on my second I injured myself soldering, and came in crying while they were negotiating with Samsung in the next room. Still got the scars. I hope at least they found me amusing.<p>The best way to get in somewhere small as an intern would be through your personal network.<p>Knocking doors is acceptable for children, but I think it would come across as for an adult. If someone you vaguely know asks their boss if you can come intern, they will probably say yes.<p>I&#x27;m assuming, from the rest of this thread, that where you are at is you are in your late teens, and thinking of going to college in 6 months or a year. Being so young is actually a big advantage.<p>People generally want to help young people. They have an expectation that you won&#x27;t have much experience, but they will want you to succeed because they would have liked someone to help them when they were young.<p>If you don&#x27;t have many software engineers in your network, go to local events, talk to people, and be up front about what you are looking for. If they can&#x27;t help you, they will direct you to people that can.<p>Oh, and keep in mind that while at the moment web/apps are the big thing, software and engineering are bigger than that. It might be that in a decade, the big thing will be applying AI to data to help people make decisions. Or you might want to get into computational biology for drug development.

It would be unsurprising if the Heritage Foundation were concerned about the very highest tax rate in great disproportion to it&#x27;s nominal consequence.<p>There are other economic freedoms: freedom from excessive gov&#x27;t granted monopolies (patent/copyright), freedom from protectionism, tariffs, limited work visas, etc. Even rich guys driven to distraction by high tax rates ought to be able to find something say about these sorts of things in an article about economic freedom, but no specific structural reforms are proposed. News flash: partisan think tank doesn&#x27;t like taxes, president.<p>For the rest of rest of us, real freedom also means not being imprisoned for interacting with other consenting adults in ways that are illegal, and not being denied due process in various ways such as: torte reform, civil asset forfeiture, being spied on by agencies who are immune from judicial review, etc. Could we take a break from wringing our hands about the welfare of the ultra-rich, and work some of that stuff too?",1389788371

Software engineers often <i>do</i> complain about spam from recruiters, in cases where the recruiters:<p>a) Plainly have not taken your skills or location or pay grade into consideration<p>b) Refuse to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer<p>c) Turn hostile or somehow imply that you owe them your time or should be grateful for their attention<p>And we generally assume that the engineers are correct in their complaints.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever seen recruiters being abusive, but I have heard voicemail messages that start with &quot;I know you said not to call you again, but...&quot;, and there&#x27;s really no question about who is in the wrong there.<p>Whether it&#x27;s actually <i>important</i> is a different question.  I get a fair few pointless enquiries via LinkedIn, and I ignore them.  I can&#x27;t say that it troubles me much.  But if the people sending those messages were insulting me, making sexually explicit statements or generally being persistent beyond all efforts to make them stop, I would probably feel much more strongly about it.<p>What puzzles me is that the behaviour of the recruiters does make at least some sense in a way that the dating site behaviour doesn&#x27;t.  Sure, getting a job spec for a senior Java developer and then mailing everyone with &quot;senior [something] developer&quot; in their past job titles on LinkedIn is going to fail quite often, as you&#x27;ll hit Senior Python Developers and Senior C++ Developers and so on, but sooner or later the recruiter has to get lucky.  But who the hell responds positively to the kinds of comments that the OP received?  Are the people sending the messages doing so because they believe that sooner or later it&#x27;s going to <i>work</i>?  Even worse, <i>does it actually work sometimes?</i>  I can&#x27;t easily believe that it does, but it&#x27;s hard to understand the behaviour otherwise.",1389788280

No-one really likes the situation but there&#x27;s nothing that can really be done about it, at least in the short term.<p>So if you&#x27;re doing software for the web browser, it must be compatible with JavaScript.

The controversial parts of the agreement (as I understand it) actually relate in part to the codification of copyright law via international treaties not subject to full disclosure/negotiation by congress. That is, the lobbyists are &quot;hacking&quot; the political system to bypass congress and the consent of the governed. The members of congress are less informed than the lobbyists (aparently, per their complaint). And they will only get a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; vote. And once its passed as a treaty, the complexity of modification will &quot;lock in&quot; any adverse policy consequences.<p>At its core, the TPP topic is about deeper issues than partisan politics. They involve the regulation of technology and fundamental issues of political economy. These are not trivially political, IMHO.

7197646,comment,7197048,7197574,12,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"As briefly as possible? Infosec is hard. Most companies have virtually no security policies. Nobody listens. Black hats are ahead in the arms race and anyone who has decent knowledge (doesn&#x27;t even have to be anywhere near on a level like Homakov or Zalewski) can pull off all sorts of exploits. Even if they don&#x27;t strike the application itself, they&#x27;ll get you through infrastructure that your application relies on. Look at how script kiddies like the SEA can pull off high-profile hacks through social engineering, domain and DNS hijacking.<p>It&#x27;s assured that a ton of Rails apps are vulnerable, it&#x27;s just that no one has found them, or more likely, is not publicly releasing or actively exploiting them.<p>Also, Rails doesn&#x27;t address for all security pitfalls.

Apple&#x27;s Find my Phone feature is already one step toward addressing this issue, and there are a handful of third-party apps on the market that do similar things. These market solutions will continue to get better over time if they&#x27;re popular.<p>And of course, there&#x27;s the question of why it&#x27;s the manufacturers&#x27; responsibility to address theft in the first place.

A technological solution may consist of software, hardware, or a combination of both software and hardware, but shall be able to withstand a hard reset. No advanced mobile communications device may be sold in California without the technological solution enabled.<p>(2) The rightful owner of an advanced mobile communications device may affirmatively elect to disable the technological solution after sale. However, the physical acts necessary to disable the technological solution may only be performed by the end-use consumer or a person specifically selected by the end-use consumer to disable the technological solution and shall not be physically performed by any retail seller of the advanced mobile communications device.<p>Hard reset is defined as &quot;the restoration of an advanced mobile communications device to the state it was in when it left the factory, and refers to any act of returning a device to that state, including processes commonly termed a factory reset or master reset.&quot;<p>Some thoughts:<p>* There doesn&#x27;t appear to be any requirement that the phone can be remotely disabled. One interpretation of this is that the only change from the status quo where practically every phone has a PIN is that the PIN withstand a hard reset.<p>* The hard reset definition is sort of dumb. When a device leaves the factory, it obviously doesn&#x27;t have any knowledge of whom its proper owner is. A hard reset, by definition, has to nullify any owner-verification system and no technological solution can withstand it.<p>* The fact that the kill switch can be disabled is encouraging.<p>* A lot would also depend on how determination of the &quot;rightful owner&quot; goes. That is, is it sufficient for someone who knows the PIN to be considered a &quot;rightful owner&quot;? This is fine 99% of the time, but there are obviously scenarios where that isn&#x27;t true. If we wanted to take this to the other extreme, we might say this would require every seller and re-seller of mobile phones to check the ID of anyone buying a phone and to record this in some sort of master ownership index. Note that this would effectively outlaw burner phones.",1391795565

But for those who do want to be developers and have flexibility...complexity will just have to be a way of life.<p>As an example, I recently tried my hand at making a Chrome extension using the Yeoman build tool. It was a simple plugin to allow you, on Reddit IAMA pages, to hide all comments except those from the IAMA subject and their direct questioners, and to also auto-load all comments:<p><a href=""https://github.com/dannguyen/iama-highlights-chrome-extension"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dannguyen/iama-highlights-chrome-extensio...</a><p>Figuring out how to use the yeoman build tool took about 30 minutes (it&#x27;s not quite fully developed)...it took about 30 minutes to browse through the Chrome extension documentation and then think of what I wanted to do. About 10 minutes to write the actual jQuery.<p>...And then about 3 - 4 hours figuring out why the comment auto-loader wasn&#x27;t working. I thought I could simply just have my jquery activate the &quot;click&quot; event on all &quot;load more comments&quot; links...but a recent Chrome upgrade clamped down on security, effectively sandboxing all extension code and preventing it from executing existing inline JavaScript.<p>IMHO, this is a good security measure. But it just goes to show you that when things are made &quot;easier&quot; (the scaffolding of the extension, the jQuery to do DOM/AJAX work), there are still intractable tradeoffs and details that have to be dealt with...in this case, security.",1391795296

When a device leaves the factory, it obviously doesn&#x27;t have any knowledge of whom its proper owner is. A hard reset, by definition, has to nullify any owner-verification system and no technological solution can withstand it.<p>* The fact that the kill switch can be disabled is encouraging.<p>* A lot would also depend on how determination of the &quot;rightful owner&quot; goes. That is, is it sufficient for someone who knows the PIN to be considered a &quot;rightful owner&quot;? This is fine 99% of the time, but there are obviously scenarios where that isn&#x27;t true. If we wanted to take this to the other extreme, we might say this would require every seller and re-seller of mobile phones to check the ID of anyone buying a phone and to record this in some sort of master ownership index.

Then you can solve the problem by &quot;pinging&quot; down to the end of the line and back, counting along the way. The first soldier sees the returned ping and fires immediately. The second soldier (who knows he&#x27;s second, since when the ping went out, the message was only at &quot;1&quot;) fires one interval after the returned ping passes by him, so that&#x27;s the same time as the first soldier does it. Likewise, the third soldier fires two intervals after hearing the returned ping.<p>Alas, in this scenario we don&#x27;t even have the ability to count, since we have a limited number of internal states to use to store numbers. So the really clever part is to encode additional information in the flow of additional messages. For example, to find the middle soldier, we can send out two pings, one three times faster than the other. They meet when the slower ping has gone through half the soldiers, and the faster one has gone all the way down the line, and back through half the soldiers (it&#x27;s three times faster). Additional pings of different speeds can bounce back and forth in order to divide the interval still further - effectively, recursing into narrower sub-lines. Everything is set up so that all of the sub-lines reach their minimal size - one soldier - at the same time, at which point they know it&#x27;s time to fire. The &quot;recursion&quot; means that the number of states can be bounded, as there are only a few different &quot;modes&quot; for the soldiers to operate in, regardless of the length of the sub-line involved.",1391794465

A rough solution is to initiate a count from the origin, starting from 0. Each node hears the previous neighbor&#x27;s count, increments it by 1 and sounds off. When the end node is reached, it knows how far the signal propagated. At this point a reverse count is initiated, terminating in 0 at the origin. Each node along the way back hears the adjacent node begin its countdown, and starts its own countdown from its relative position. The return signal reaches the origin node just as the remainder of the nodes reach 0, and all node execute simultaneously on 0 (with appropriate modification for any fencepost problems).<p>No external reference clock is required, and assuming each node counts at exactly the same rate, all nodes act in unison.",1391794042

This is not a new story.<p>From the Wikipedia entry on Guilds:\n<i>As Ogilvie (2004) shows, the guilds negatively affected quality, skills, and innovation. Through what economists now call &quot;rent-seeking&quot; they imposed deadweight losses on the economy. Ogilvie says they generated no demonstrable positive externalities and notes that industry began to flourish only after the guilds faded away. Guilds persisted over the centuries because they redistributed resources to politically powerful merchants. On the other hand, Ogilvie agrees, guilds created &quot;social capital&quot; of shared norms, common information, mutual sanctions, and collective political action. This social capital benefited guild members, even as it hurt outsiders.</i><p>The heyday of guilds lasted from around 1200 to 1700...",1391792792

They also told me once we report the phone as lost and block it using IMEI then this change can&#x27;t be undone incase you find your phone then it can&#x27;t be activated again. And, the block using IMEI does not work across carriers which means if its blocked in AT&T then the person carrying that lost phone can activate the phone on any other network like verizon, spring, t-mobile etc.<p>Carriers can maintain a centralised database to keep list of stolen phones and can also undo the change incase the owner finds it. They can also track the people who are calling using stolen phones but they dont do it. The best reason I can guess for not doing that is as you said - why they will do something which will hurt their own business",1391792620

So it is cheaper and affordable for more people if we time share them.<p>Cars are much cheaper, so we don't - the value of having a personal car ready <i>right now</i> is worth more to people than taking public transport.

They were fun at the time, but I don't really think they helped me develop much personally.<p>2. I participated in some out of school gifted programs that helped me tremendously. I also just learned things on my own time for fun.<p>3. I went to 2 different middle schools and 3 different high schools (one of them being the school recieving the lowest amount of funding among all the schools in the state). Most of them were really tight on money and were cutting a lot of programs, both academic and otherwise.<p>While I do wish that school sponsered gifted programs could get more funding as I know gifted programs <i>can</i> be great, if money is tight, I'd rather money go to other programs. There are many ways a gifted child can learn on their own if they choose to, if some one has an undiagnosed learning disability they can't just change that on a whim.<p>Really I wish schools just got more funding in general. It varies greatly from school to school (I reccently saw my partners old high shcool and I was amazed at how nice the they had proper gym equipment and clean facilities, I don't know about their actual programs, but it looked like they'd have the money to spend on gifted programs), but at the schools I went to there simply wasn't enough money to go around.",1323377733

The stated results follow immediately if you look at the cumulative density function for the exponential.<p>Stated another way, suppose service times followed a Uniform distribution. Then none of this would hold. But because they are Exponential, these results come into play. Intuitively, we think in terms of Uniform distribution. So your mind is saying, wait a minute, if there are 1000 people in a queue, they probably average a 10 to 15 service minute per person. But that's like saying if there are 1000 people in an office, they probably make 100k on average because that's about what you (might) make. In reality incomes follow a Pareto, so your janitors will take home 30k and your managers will pull in a couple mil. A similar sort of dynamic applies here with the exponential distribution.

That your home schooled kids will somehow become anti-social.<p>My wife and I home schooled (up to high school) our kids and socialization is a non-issue for three reasons:<p>1) There are other home schooled kids and they often get together in groups (more on that in a minute).<p>2) Good home schooling involves interacting with a lot more people from different backgrounds giving more social experience per unit time.<p>3) One of the common complaints of school students is how <i>messed up</i> the social scene is with regard to cliques, fashion herds, and morality memes.<p>The image that comes to mind when you think 'home school' is that you and your kid, one on one, going through the curriculum. However, there are lots of people and if you look around you will find that a lot of them are home schooling too. When you find the group that is compatible with your tastes you can plan group activities. Our group was covering science by each parent taking the whole group one day a week to focus on something they knew really well, that group was 10 - 15 kids of a variety of ages.<p>Then there are programs like the Riekes Center[2] which spend one day a week with a group of kids understanding a local park's biological diversity.<p>The bottom line is that socialization is the least of the problems you will face. Things that annoy you, people 'turning you in' because your kids aren't in school. People assuming that because you are home schooling you are a science hating religious fanatic, or are a science hating alternate medicine/crystal/universe fanatic, or are sacrificing your child's well-being because they are too lazy to go to school.<p>[1] ""bogey man"" that mythical creature that is going to 'get you' if you don't conform.

3330888,comment,3328030,3328030,1,0,tmroyal,,,"I am a beginner. I am trying to learn Rails. I am finding it difficult because the tutorials tend to be walkthroughs of creating very specific types of web apps, with understanding of the concepts being offered a side effect. I often have questions about why and wherefore of certain decisions tutorial authors make. My only recourse is the documentation, which is too large for me to maintain my excitement for too long, especially with my busy schedule.<p>I do not get excited about the sudden ability to make things because I have been making things (not webapps) for some time.<p>I have had much more success learning Sinatra. While the tutorials are similarly designed, the reduced reliance of magic makes it easier for me understand the purpose of the commands given. There are no files that are generated for me in places that I have to go looking for that do something important that I don't have to think about (but I do have to understand.) In fact, Sinatra has helped me to understand Rails in hindsight.<p>I think the issue is that the tutorials I have looked at tend to be trying to sell Rails as an awesome tool to make things. This has emphasized ease of use over understanding of concepts. You can contrast these tutorials with books or tutorials for any programming language. Books on programming languages tend to be more abstract and while they limit one's power at first, they enhance one's awareness in the end. Tutorials on Rails do the opposite for me.<p>Maybe I should have just bought a book on Rails (like the tutorials said.)",1323375036

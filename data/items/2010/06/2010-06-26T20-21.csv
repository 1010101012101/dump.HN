I had tons of ideas and off the top of my head, at least 6 of them made it into the construction stage. The score: 4 busts, 1 nice acquisition, and 1 evolved into a business I'm currently working on. Aim for success, but don't be discouraged by failureÂ if you learn from it. Also, market response to your ideas is 100% unpredictable. Users/customers vote with their attention and wallets and not with their words of encouragement/discouragement. Don't run your idea past anyone... just do it. One of my bigger failures was the one most congratulated by peers and one of my bigger successes was mocked before it became a cultural phenomenon. Good luck and have fun!",1277585991

1464268,comment,1464238,1464238,0,0,makecheck,,,"Personally, I think that's a great thing to do, especially when your line of work uses a computer.  Even if you're not working, you can still build your skills (hacking on open source, iPhone apps, web pages, whatever) while living almost anywhere.  Enjoy life, avoid the stress, it's always worth it.<p>The main risks I can see are that it may be harder to connect with people in your industry, and you may find few jobs willing to let you work remotely (this tends to be available only to very experienced people, e.g. CTO can live in the mountains if he wants, and the company says OK).  Then again, if you're trying to avoid 9-5, not even having a job for a few months is still good stress relief.",1277585503

I think I got that because I started reading newspaper articles when I was very young (strongly recommended to all parents).<p>It seems I'm a bit different than most other people here that I open and read new tabs as they come up, rather than opening them in the background and coming back to them (like a call stack instead of a queue), which helps for maintaining context. The articles that I tend to get large stacks on are math articles. I think my stack-based approach came from starting on math articles, because you need to understand underlying referenced concepts before you can continue with the rest of the article. Most other subjects aren't so linear, not even historical subjects, because an individual tends to participate in several events, an an event impacts several individuals, and you get all sorts of back- and forward-references.<p>On a related note, I have read references books cover-to-cover, including a selective dictionary (one that only includes difficult words, not ""the"" and ""door""). Textbooks with excercizes are far better for retention, but I always stop instead of doing the excercizes.",1277585457

There's still a piece of conditional logic, for each dimension, but it only gets written once.  The application code gets smaller by applying this, except for one startup routine where we set up the thunk.  Overall, it's actually less code than sprinkling conditionals everywhere.  You could set things up so you change the configuration of all your A/B experiments in a single file.  It's not so much a pattern as it is a reorganization of the logic along a straightforward application of DRY.<p>One might still want to stick with the conditionals everywhere if most of the code needs local state.

Then itâs quickly getting scratches.<p>Likewise for the chrome bezel. Within an hour of ditching my iPhone's case, I nicked the damn thing with a very slight bump. It was a huge relief to see Apple lose the chrome for the iPhone 4. But after one of Engadget's phones got a nice big scratch on the back, I can no longer assume they're using gorilla glass on both sides.<p>I'm forced to believe they make questionable material choices merely to increase the ""shiny"", which is one of my main gripes with Apple. It's undoubtedly why they use glossy displays by default on MacBooks, iMacs, and iPads, even though matte is far more usable.",1277583100

(My friends and I sometimes talk -- mostly jokingly -- about the English tax: if you need somebody to explain things to you in English, you are almost certainly paying a premium over market for that service.  On high-end apartments, for example, the difference between going to the place I know which markets itself as foreigner friendly and walking into the apartment service and asking for the comparable apartment next door is about 50%.)",1277582802

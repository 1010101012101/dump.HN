3257315,comment,3256721,3257159,3,0,jwhite,,,"I generally agree with the sentiment that writing programs, which are supposed to be advanced technology, is done with tools that are often woefully bad and seem stuck in a long past decade, but be wary of generalizing about ""you"" so much.  I use emacs because I find I'm the most productive with emacs, and because it's the best environment for Common Lisp development, but I'm aware of its warts and will happily criticise them at length -- even when talking to vim users!  Not everyone who uses emacs is as breathless about it as the author of the article.<p>I do think your jab at emacs lisp is spot on -- it's really not the lisp you want, and Common Lisp is certainly good enough these days to have a stab at writing an emacs clone in it.  I don't know enough about Scheme to comment about it though.<p>My favourite candidate for most decrepit CS tool is GDB -- it astounds me that this is still the best the open source / Unix world can produce in the field of debuggers, especially since debuggers are the sort of non-user-facing, lots-of-interesting-technical-problems type of area that open source usually excels at.  Every time it repeatedly segfaults and kills my carefully constructed debugging state I just want to cry.",1321765160

If these turn out wrong they can always fall back to some ""its all the numbers fault"" or ""Deloitte said so"" explanation.<p>In my opinion the whole Consulting industry strives substantially on the fact, that they provide management with a third external authority. This is an ideal constellation for a manager since first the consulting firm's suggestions don't have to be implemented if they are not representing his/her interest. But if they are in line with the personal view, they give additional weight to that position.

3257296,comment,3256582,3256582,14,0,bluedanieru,,,"I love Skyrim, and in fact it has taken up way too much of my time over the past week. And I will probably waste many days over the next few <i>years</i>, if Oblivion is any indication, both playing this and screwing around with making mods. But the answer to this guy's question is really simple.<p>There aren't learning environments that are just like Skyrim because you don't learn shit in Skyrim. The basic mechanics of the game are very simple and can be picked up in less than five minutes. It has enormous depth, more than its predecessor and arguably more than TES3 which is famous for it, but you can learn all of it in an hour (not playtime mind you, but an hour browsing some wiki). Its much-lauded lore, while compelling and among the best in video games, is comparable to any second-rate novel. When I say it has enormous depth I mean <i>for a game</i>. Compared to math, physics, programming, history, politics, or virtually any other intellectual pursuit, it is as shallow as an issue of <i>Maxim</i>. This is not an insult. It is entertainment.<p>Skyrim is not 'hard'. It is not hard in the sense that it could require athletic ability, and it is not hard in the sense that it could be difficult to progress in the game. A bright eight year-old could solve the hardest puzzle in Skyrim. If you play the game long enough, you will finish even if you are as dumb and incurious as a rock. You will not master mathematics by playing a mathematics game if you are dumb as a rock, or if you are naturally intelligent for that matter. Mastering such skills takes <i>decades</i>. And it is hard work. You have to do a lot of boring shit. And it is not always clear, the way forward. You can spend a lot of time on a thing where you later find out that most of your efforts didn't have much point, after all. It can become very tempting to give up, and if you aren't dedicated that's what you will do. Intellectual achievement is brutal and unforgiving, because you are dealing with reality and not a fantasy that someone else has created for you.<p>If I played Skyrim 8-10 hours a day, every day, I would get bored with it pretty quickly. There just isn't a lot of material to digest. I have been programming for 8-10 hours a day for <i>years</i>, and I still find it immensely rewarding and satisfying. No game can match that, and no game can provide the mostly self-directed exploration that true learning requires.<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to playing Skyrim :-D",1321764372

There's nothing quite like it in emacs. Emacs generally takes a more interactive approach, where each part is a separate command that can be interactively repeated. It's left to the user to combine them either by recording (and saving) a macro or by taking the function names for the commands and writing their own command. Emacs is rarely fewer keystrokes by default. For people who like vim editing commands there's viper, vimpulse, and evil.<p>da( = C-r ( RET C-w<p>My C-w is customized to cut the appropriate thing at point if there's no region. Without that you'd need a C-M-SPC before C-w<p>I would often do C-M-u repeatedly as it would cycle me through [, (, and {.<p>ya{ = C-r { RET M-w<p>Again I'd normally use C-M-u instead of C-r {, but if you know you want a { this is better. The difference between emacs and vim approach is clear here. Emacs separates the things and makes each step interactive, so you don't have to think before hand how many { are between cursor and where you want to start yank.<p>ci[ = C-M-9 C-k<p>C-M-9 is my custom which goes inside [, (, or {.

Editors are productivity tools, not religions that if you don't use one you will end up going to hell.<p>Learning is good.

You go into battles with historically accurate forces and goals with the cut scenes between battles delivering the political and historical background.  Then there are RPGs like Romance of the Three Kingdoms where sure it is more historical fiction than historical fact, but the events and setting portrayed are fairly accurately captured.",1321762420

There were few right answers although there were those which clearly were wrong.  At no point did any professor say, ""Make business decisions based on the values of these metrics.""<p>A good analogy might be found in some software I'm working on now.  Part of it is a specialized serialization scheme designed to produce small serialized forms of large numbers of similar tree graphs.  It is easy to quantify the size of the serialized form of N million trees, and it is easy to measure the CPU/IO time required to produce this form.  However, when making design decisions, I only use these metrics as one input into my thought process. If I do X, how easy will it be for others to maintain after I leave (I'm a contractor)?  Does a proposed design decision limit future opportunities for this module's use?  Does ""brittleness"" increase?  Does this decision move the design further away from using Mongo/HBase/whatever in the future, or does it lessen the current impedance mismatch?  The easy metrics are time and space, but the might not be the most important ones.",1321761758

That&#x27;s all a bit fuzzy, but specifically things like heated floors and lighting which sense presence, windows which react to lighting conditions or insolation requirements, voice controls, panels which turn into display surfaces or speakers and a desk which could charge and update objects wirelessly when placed on it would all be very useful and far more powerful if driven by software which was updatable. Software <i>will</i> eat the world, one object/material at a time.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the revolution will be in one OS which runs your home (though corporations would love to sell you that), it might be more in our tools, clothes and structures gradually becoming networked and part of a global computer. Specific operating systems seem to me to be declining in importance as the network grows and a constellation of devices which talk to each other arises. There are of course potential downsides like security and privacy but I think those will be outweighed by the obvious benefits.<p>Do we need any of this? No, and our ancestors lived without it. Will we want any of it? Probably, if on balance it improves our quality of life.",1441659445

Let&#x27;s stop kidding ourselves about it - many, many poor people are poor because they lack the basic building blocks for success that we take for granted: god-given intelligence, a strong work ethic, long-term thinking, careful considering for non-trivial decisions, an upbringing that values education, etc. I&#x27;m NOT saying all, but definitely many. So to the extent people and organizations are trying to in some way take advantage of &quot;poor&quot; people, this isn&#x27;t really accurate - they are trying to take advantage of people who don&#x27;t make good decisions. Heck, if you were trying to sucker someone for money, wouldn&#x27;t you (ignoring everything else) go after someone with lots of money? People can&#x27;t &quot;catch their breath&quot; or &quot;get their affairs in order&quot; not because of systemic oppression, but because they simply don&#x27;t have the basic life skills to do it in the first place...that&#x27;s probably a large part of why they&#x27;re poor. There&#x27;s also just a lot of inertia with this stuff, but we&#x27;re getting way off topic. I read an interesting book about this years ago called The Persistence of Poverty, which I would recommend.<p>None of this is to say I am not empathetic or have any compassion.

10182898,comment,10181042,10182380,0,0,lukego,,,"Great question actually.<p>That is one solution: take a 10G port into Snabb Switch, filter and sort the traffic, then feed a slice to the kernel e.g. via a tap device with multiqueue /dev/vhost-net acceleration (same interface that QEMU/KVM uses).<p>The risk I see here is that maybe it is even harder to tune your kernel when it is using a software interface for I/O instead of a hardware one. The kernel can depend on so many things (multiqueue, TSO, LRO, checksum, encap offload, etc) that can behave differently between hardware/software NICs and you would need to be confident that this will work out well. Otherwise the risk is that you take your hardest problem - tuning the kernel - and make it even harder.<p>If we are only talking about 2x10G ports per server then one alternative would be to connect Snabb Switch to the kernel with a physical 10G port instead of a software one. That is, separate the DDoS-protecting frontend (Snabb) from the backend (kernel) with a network cable. You could still run the Snabb application on the same server but with a dedicated network card cabled directly to the kernel. (You could also run it on a different server if you prefer.)<p>End off-cuff braindump :-)",1441657464

You already have 3 giants competing over every single user (Facebook, twitter and google+) and i&#x27;d say its very pointless to compete with them.<p>Plus your idea is too broad, its a sharing platform/social network/ Shop? I don&#x27;t even advice on having a sharing platform for all medias, let alone an idea this broad, which would be almost impossible to identify, contain and brand.\nBut nevertheless i wish you the best of luck",1441656491

Of course LIFO is the fastest on average, but you want there to be a reasonable, predictable bound on how much time an individual can expect to wait.<p>Right, this is generally handled by how we (implicitly) judge queues, not by the average wait, but by the average <i>square</i> of the wait, and penalize extreme wait times that are concentrated on one person.<p>It&#x27;s why it&#x27;s better to have one line feed into multiple clerks rather than each clearly get their own line: because there&#x27;s the risk of some transaction taking a long time and screwing everyone in that line.<p>Single-queue avoids that by allowing people to be routed around that clerk. There&#x27;s no change in the average, but you&#x27;ve avoided major quadratic penalties.<p>It&#x27;s also the problem with LIFO: even if you could somehow stop people from leaving their early-entrance spot (!!) to re-enter for a better one, you&#x27;re still sticking a few people with horrible wait times, which good metrics penalize.",1441656343

941095,comment,940728,940929,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Yes, but do you BUY 10 newspapers a day? Hardly. Circulation is a source of revenue (currently a larger source of revenue for papers than online ads). Moreover, buying a physical paper encourages someone to spend more time with it, to read it thoroughly and to have greater exposure to the ads. Even today print ads are more valuable, per eyeball, than online ads. When you visit those 10 newspaper sites a day, how many ads do you click? How many ads do you even read?<p>This is not to say that a paper couldn't survive with only online ad revenue, far from it. The key point is that the operations of those 10 newspapers whose sites you visit are no cheaper today than they were a decade ago. Most importantly, they are not cheap enough to be supported entirely by online ad revenue. And when you take away the print revenue and the circulation revenue, online ads are all that's left. You probably don't read the classified ads, the weather forecasts, the republications of identical national wire reports, or the beetle bailey cartoons at each and every one of those 10 newspapers. Yet each of those papers still puts out all of that material. And that costs money. It costs yet more money to arrange everything for a physical page and print tens or hundreds of thousands of physical copies of the paper every day.<p>Papers could survive if they changed, but they don't want to change. Because if they concentrated on just the tiny fraction of work that they do that isn't redundant or unnecessary in the online world they would be much smaller operations than they are today. Not only that, but, odd as it sounds, not reprinting beetle bailey and all that other crap would cause them to lose a lot of subscribers in the short-term, even though it might be healthier in the long-term. So papers haven't changed much even while their industry has been radically transformed by technology.<p>And most papers won't change much. It's questionable whether there exists a path between the way a given paper exists today and the sort of entity that could exist in the online world, it may be that it's easier to build something else from scratch.<p>This deal with Microsoft is yet one more example of newspapers trying to avoid inevitable changes to their ways of doing business.",1258155579
941094,comment,940385,940385,0,0,solidlaw,,,"This is a good website.  It appears that this service does what redbeacon does, in matching requests to businesses, except your website is also a social network in addition to free advertisements for companies. I think the value propisition is good and if you can get enough people to upload a commercial it could be a very resourceful website.  This is certainly attainable in that there are thousands of videos uploaded to youtube per day, some of which are for people who are uploading business ""commercials"".  I can see that prospectvista.com allows much more control for branding than youtube.  Youtube obviously provides more immediate coverage since everyone knows about youtube, but if a company is trying to brand itself on youtube the next link could be a kid lighting his fart on fire.  I could see why companies would opt for prospectvista.com where they can have more control over their profile and what is shown on it.  I logged in via the password you supplied and the ""request center"" looks to be a very solid deal.  So, in essence I see this as a website for companies to advertise on, brand their emails with a link to their own commercial, as well as get business leads from the request center.

I can see some of the points from the reviewers, but again, as a whole I think your website is good and if you can get traction on people using it, it could be big.",1258155565

941089,comment,940403,940932,0,0,btilly,,,"History note for you.  Newton understood calculus through the idea of fluxions.  It is often claimed that an insistence on teaching calculus with Newton's fluxions instead of Leibniz' infinitesmals held back research in England for a long time.  (Another random note.  Bishop Berkeley's famous comment about ""ghosts of departed quantities"" was a criticism of fluxions, not infinitesmals.  In fact he had positive things to say about infinitesmals.)  So yes, I do think it would be bad for students to understand calculus like Newton did. :-)<p>That said, to my eyes the primary problem with how we teach calculus is that we introduce too many big concepts at the same time.  The key picture that people should come away with is the tangent line.  But when you say that the derivative is a function defined at each point as the slope of the tangent line at that point, most people experience brain freeze.<p>Instead I would like to see students get to the point where they can calculate tangent lines.  Then stop.  Work out lots of tangent lines for lots of functions.  Introduce them to how the tangent line can be used to estimate error bars.  (Typical word problem, if a rock take 5 +- 0.5s to fall off a cliff, how tall is the cliff?)  And then only after the picture and mechanics of the tangent line is well established should we move on to defining the derivative.<p>This approach, if done right, would be rigorous but informal.  It should avoid the problem of causing brain freeze by presenting too many layers of generality at once.  And it would really cement the key image behind half of calculus.",1258155174

If you have truly amazing ideas this could be <i>maybe</i> 50% of what you bring to the table, but more likely your ideas will be 5-10% of your contribution, because once you get going on an idea you are going to need to iterate and at that point you need everyone to be bringing ideas to the table.<p>The essence of a pointy-haired boss is someone who has a lot of ideas (which may be good or bad), but is so entrenched in middle management that they have no idea how to actually get things done.  As an engineer I love when people have great ideas, but I hate when I'm the only one working 16 hour days because the non-technical folks think their job is to tell me what to do then wait til it's done.<p>What constitutes valuable contributions?

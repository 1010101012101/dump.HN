Ibex are found in Eurasia, North Africa, and East Africa. The name ibex comes from Latin, borrowed from Iberian or Aquitanian, akin to Old Spanish bezerro ""bull"", modern Spanish becerro ""yearling"". Ranging in height from 27 to 43 inches and weighing 200 to 270 pounds (90 to 120 kg), the ibex can live 20 years.",1203590393

BurgerPipe.com's understated use of navigational system beeps alone has already created massive economic synergies. Yahoo, Microsoft, Facebook, and Xobni are all pretenders to the throne. At the end of the day, there's only one Google-killer, and it happens to be a burger in the shape of a pipe.",1203589075

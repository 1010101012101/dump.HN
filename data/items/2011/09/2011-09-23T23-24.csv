There is less structure and support, for example no ""Demo Day"" to work towards. You also don't get a check made payable to your startup to relieve your short term cashflow concerns and allow you to focus completely on your product.<p>Startup Chile is more like what I imagine taking a government job as an ""Entrepreneur in Residence"" might be like. We earn points by actively working to give back to the community, each team is expected to earn a minimum number over the 6 months. In return we get fast tracked through the admin of moving to a new country (getting visas and social security numbers) and are given access to a $40K budget to reimburse most, but not all, of our expenses.<p>You should expect to spend a couple of days a month working through the (bureaucratic) government reimbursement process and organizing / participating in community activities.<p>A few notes on the reimbursement process:<p>1) You have to spend money on things before you can get it back, and have to pay off any payments made by credit card before you get reimbursed.<p>2) You will probably need to put in around $10K so you have cashflow allowing you to spend the $40K within the 6 months allowed.<p>3) There are lots of rules restricting what can and can't be reimbursed. You need to make sure you understand all the terms and conditions before you spend any cash.<p>4) There are limitations on some forms of spending, for example:
a) You will need to get 3 competing quotes before spending more than $5K.
b) You will need to ask permission in advance of booking travel / events and they won't be reimbursed until after you have taken the trip / attended the event.<p>5) You will only ever get 90% of what you spend reimbursed. So $44k = $40k.<p>6) The complexity of the system means that there are inconsistencies between startups on what gets reimbursed and what does not.<p>It saddens me to say this but you shouldn't expect to have your mind blown by the quality of the startups here. There's lots of talking and not enough shipping. Unless contacts in Latin America are critical to your business, Startup Chile will not accelerate your startup any more than other forms of cash.<p>tl;dr: Apply to Startup Chile for the experience of living in another country amongst a community of ambitious people from around the world.

When I first signed up for Facebook, it was still in 'college only' mode, and what I posted was with that restriction in mind.<p>Over the past few years, this has dramatically changed; now I'm friends with coworkers, parents, etc. As my list of friends/target audience changed, the posts I made shifted in nature to stay appropriate to my current list of friends at the time that I posted any piece of content. When Facebook enabled post-specific privacy controls, I made lists and used them religiously for restricting access to content I provided.<p>However, short of clicking through each and every one of my old posts and changing the access control list or removing the content/untagging myself, how do I prevent the next boss or coworker that I friend on Facebook next week/month/year from easily seeing the dumb shit that I was posting back in 07 when my target audience was other college kids?<p>What I really wish existed was a privacy setting that allows me to restrict people from viewing content that existed before our Facebook friendship began.

Unfortunately, operating and free cash flows are driven solely by the fact that Groupon is dragging its feet in remitting coupon sale payments to its merchants.  Had merchants been paid in a timely fashion, the Companys free cash flows would likely have been closer to zero and possibly even negative.  Seriously, in a competitive market space, how long does Groupon believe that it can get away with a 60 day payment delay (or longer) to merchants?  Merchants simply cannot stay in business by providing services (even discounted ones), two months ahead of payment.  Simply put, Groupons free cash flows arent real.  They come from an unusual (and likely temporary) vendor financing model, and are not sustainable.""<p> Groupon's internal controls are inadequate to make their self-reported numbers credible:<p>""It is absolutely ludicrous to think that Groupon is anywhere close to having an effective set of internal controls over financial reporting having done 17 acquisitions in a little over a year.  When a company expands to 45 countries, grows merchants from 212 to 78,466, and expands its employee base from 37 to 9,625 in only two years, there is little doubt that internal controls are not working somewhere.  Any M&A expert will agree.  And dont forget that Groupon admitted to having an inexperienced accounting and reporting staff.  Note that Ernst & Young supplied an audit opinion about the financial statements but not about the entitys internal control system.  E&Y instead points out, We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  So we ask how have these weak or nonexistent controls affected the numbers Groupon reports?  Can we trust these numbers?""<p>Groupon's business-professor cofounder, Eric Lefkofsky, has dumped about $382 million of his shares in the prior private financings.",1316820046

It is <i>not</i> cut and dried as to what one state may make a resident of a completely different state do. Amazon probably is correct, and forcing Amazon to collect sales tax for your state probably is an overreach.<p>It should be pointed out, since so many people forget this in this discussion, that as a resident of a state you are frequently required to pay the sales tax to the state directly in the form of a ""use tax"". This isn't about consumers <i>owing</i> sales tax, technically the states have already made that happen. It isn't about Amazon ""not paying"" this tax, because it is the consumer's responsibility at that point. It is about one state forcing an entity not in its jurisdiction to do something for the convenience (and little more) of that state.

Many of their practices however are laughable at best and rarely accomplish their stated goals.<p>Why should I trust your soft approach to UX? If I'm paying you 70,000 a year, that means you should be providing more than 70,000 a year worth of value - Otherwise theres not really much point in hiring you. Can any UX designer, even in principle, provide more than modest value for sites whose users don't number into the 10s of millions? Keep in mind that its <i>not</i> the difference between no design and a good design when you hire a UX designer, Its the difference between a design generated by someone who isn't a UX professional (but probably is willing to read up on the elements of successful design) and a UX professional who.... possesses no real qualifications or mechanism to distinguish him from the non-UX professional save his assertion that he ""has an eye for design"". You could hire a High school graduate with an interest in technology, offer to pay him 25k/yr to sit in a comfy chair and write out jquery + html and be absolutely stoked about it, how much more of a value proposition do you get out of a ""UX designer""?<p>I want to clarify this isn't a dig against people who truly provide value and make a difference for users - Theres some UX & UI people out there who are changing the face of their businesses by the work of their own hands and their untamable passion for the human enterprise. But those people would have likely kicked ass anyway.<p>So I suppose lastly, I'd be distrustful as a rule of most people who claim to generate value through soft, rather than hard means. Historically you would not be unwise to bet on the success of Mathematics and the failure of subjective analysis in virtually every field ranging from analyzing human emotions to machine translation, even fields traditionally decried for being approached mathematically (Because surely a human can only understand what makes up being human?) have been absolutely revolutionized by using an approach that has been working for the past 10k years of human history - Application of cold logic and lots and lots of hard work.<p>So whats someone who isn't a ""science person"" to do in an era that increasingly marginalizes those who cannot do hard mental labor?

The worst part is these debts are inescapable; the wages from your nonexistent job will be garnished for eternity. You can thank the U.S Gov. for that. Then when you ask yourself what you got out of it- a bunch of lectures, outdated powerpoint presentations, and useless tests- that's when things get really depressing. And that job you were supposed to get when you got out? LOLZ. It disappeared quicker than the smoke from your first bong hit from when you joined Lambda Alpha Shmelta freshman year. Recessions are a biatch. Now you get to join the hordes looking for jobs in their $60 monkey suits and empty briefcases.<p>When I think of college now, I think of big fancy institutions with nice looking buildings and nice looking equipment, with incredibly over-paid professors that are half-teaching naive kids stuff they won't even remember, or won't even be useful by the time they graduate. In most cases, it's stuff you could have learned on your own, buying an $8 used book off of Amazon and reading it in a few days. Yet students are forced to buy $300 dollar textbooks, because their professor got kickbacks from the publisher to require the 22nd edition of their Art History text.<p>It's all a business. Period. Under no circumstances should an education cost $30,000 or more a year. Unless members from an advanced alien race flew down in a spaceship and landed in my backyard, promising me that they would show me the secrets of the universe and an internship in another galaxy for $30,000, I might do it, but I would still try and bargain with them. But people go to second rate universities all the time and pay that kind of money for degrees in Fine Arts and Liberal Arts. LMAO. What the hell kind of job are your going to get when you graduate? Listen kid with a film degree, no one in Hollywood gives a shit about your short film about a kid with werewolf syndrome who finally accepts himself through the help of a retarded child. You might land a job as an assistant for some under-funded productions company somewhere, but you could have got that without any degrees.<p>Even more noble degrees are turning out to be more worthless by the minute; most science degrees, urban affairs degrees, even some degrees in business are about as good as a G.E.D. Look, the whole point is, you're going to college to get a good job and make money, right? The thing is, those jobs are vanishing by the day, and even if there are openings, there are more qualified people with experience and hundreds of others with the same crappy degree applying for them. If you want a job so bad, you're better off learning Chinese and moving to the Nanchang province, because that's where they all got outsourced. And if you're going to college to just learn, there are far cheaper, faster, and exponentially more effective ways to learn about whatever you want, not just the crap they have chosen for you already.<p>Forget about the status you will gain or what people will think about you if you go to college or not. If you're going to college to make a lot of money, just know that no one gets rich from a job. You get rich by owning assets, and by producing and selling things. Unless you really want to be a doctor, lawyer, or in high finance that requires a degree, then consider skipping college all together. Figure out what you really love doing/creating and find a way to sell it to people. And if you want to learn, there is boatloads of inexpensive and interesting books, unlike ridiculously priced college text books. There is also the internet, which used correctly, can make you ten thousand times smarter than the guy who graduated from Thomas Jefferson U. Then, if it requires, you get a mentor who can actually show you the ropes. College will never do any of that, and therefore is a giant ripoff and waste of time.",1309381647

I'm not aware of any objective way to evaluate these sorts of design techniques, and if you're looking for proof, you'll have to look elsewhere. (But ask yourself what proof you have for any design technique you hold dear.)<p>Here's a brief rationale for each one.<p>Important and popular:<p>- Refactoring: Allows you to improve design as you learn.<p>- TDD: Significantly reduces programmer error.<p>- Closures + first-class functions: Enables new design abstractions which reduce duplication.<p>- Domain-driven design: Nothing really new here, but it's a useful way to describe OO design that's finally making an impact on the legions of people who programmed procedurally in an OO language.<p>Important but not popular:<p>- Evolutionary design: The only technique I've seen that actually improves code quality over the long term. See also <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/continuousDesign.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/continuousDesign.pdf</a> (PDF)<p>- Refactoring beyond what's built into IDEs: Most people I meet don't significantly improve the design of their software when they refactor. Instead, when they need big improvements, they rewrite (and call it ""refactoring""). I think that's because they don't really understand refactoring, which involves a series of small, behavior-preserving steps, most of which are not automated by IDEs.<p>- Domain and business expertise: Provides context for trade-off decisions.<p>- Conway's Law: I see the most defects and productivity problems at the boundaries between teams. This makes team structure an architectural question as well as a political question. When you have a large system, how do you break it into parts and who works on what? A careless approach results in a lot of cross-team communication, which leads to performance problems and defects.<p>- Minimizing maintenance costs: Most software spends more time in maintenance than in initial development. See also <a href=""http://jamesshore.com/Articles/Quality-With-a-Name.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jamesshore.com/Articles/Quality-With-a-Name.html</a><p>Popular but long-term pain:<p>- DSLs: Suffer the same problems that frameworks do, but worse: When your needs diverge from the solution offered, you have to hack in kludgey workarounds. They suffer from leaky abstractions, so when they don't work right, it's time-consuming and difficult to figure out what's wrong. You're locked into their syntax, so switching to an alternate approach is difficult at best and requires a rewrite at worst.<p>- BDD: Started out as ""TDD with different words"" and became steadily more obsessed with automated english-language specifications, which adds cost over TDD without adding significant value. The hope that business users will read (let alone write) a BDD specification is a pipe dream in nearly all cases, and programmers are perfectly capable of reading well-written code--which has the additional benefit of being more precise than english. The ""fluent"" interface many BDD frameworks use suffer all the DSL problems I just mentioned. External DSLs like Cucumber gravitate towards slow and fragile end-to-end tests (see next item) and also don't play well with refactoring tools, which is a maintenance problem.<p>- Acceptance test-driven development: <a href=""http://jamesshore.com/Blog/The-Problems-With-Acceptance-Testing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jamesshore.com/Blog/The-Problems-With-Acceptance-Test...</a>",1309381456

It would be like Sacramento wanting the shop in San Francisco to collect additional Sacramento city sales tax because I'm from there.<p>Keep in mind that I'm not a CPA, and these analogies probably suck.",1309381368

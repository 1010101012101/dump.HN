Therefore, simple MySQL permissions would not be sufficient to prevent an attacker from corrupting huge amounts of data belonging to other people's accounts.<p>""Well web services has to run insert/update/delete queries too based on user input --- where the attacker modifies the source code that generates the input."" -- If you sanitize your inputs on the server side, no attacker will ever be able to run arbitrary SQL. This is crucial.<p>""One can validate input using MySQL trigger/SP too"" -- I certainly wouldn't look forward to writing a trigger that, for example, prevents user A from editing records belonging to user B. This is so much easier to do in the application layer.<p>""Basically MySQL is also a service that you can control, but it doesn't run on port 80."" -- You should use the right tool for the job. Sure, you <i>could</i>, for some applications, make an open MySQL server secure. But this is picking the wrong tool for the job. An application layer is far, far better suited to this task than a MySQL server all by itself. This is because your application layer can be written in the language and framework of your choice, giving you much richer ways to express business logic than MySQL can offer.",1324796346

And while you get the best service that Sonic can offer, 20Mbit is the upper limit. We get about 6Mbit. I've been seriously considering getting the paired Fusion service to bump that up to 12.<p>Overall though, I've been very happy with them. The only reason why I've considered switching is the speed.

But after 3 months they decided that the online sales weren't working out and that they should pursue the more traditional avenue of selling CD's out of retail stores. Two similar stories with vastly different outcomes.<p>I say that it's similar because both are well established acts in the entertainment industry, releasing their work unencumbered by DRM (or other encryption) via a website. As I see it, the main differences are (in very general terms):<p>- Radiohead said that fans could pay whatever they wanted for the album, Louis C.K. charged $5\n- Radiohead are a band, Louis C.K. is a comedian\n- Radiohead tried it in 2007, Louis C.K. in 2011<p>Of these 3, the most significant difference that I see is that Radiohead didn't set any price tag on their work while Louis C.K did. By some estimates more than half of the people who downloaded In Rainbows did so without paying a penny for it. Louis C.K., on the other hand, charged $5 right up front. The price tag was so low that it was a pretty easy decision for most who bought it, but it was there nonetheless.<p>I think that speaks volumes about setting customer's expectations appropriately, an area in which the software industry traditionally shoots itself in the foot.

312730,comment,312122,312309,0,0,lincolnq,,,"I think number theory might help. I don't know much about it, but the way most number generators work (as I understand it) is that they are a representation of a big number which is the internal state, and that internal state completely traverses some large space (2 to some large power) where it hits everything once, and you are only observing a few bits at a time of the value of the internal state.<p>That leads me to think that if you used a small state space (close to size x - maybe the next prime greater than x) you could walk the whole space and hit every number once.<p>Example: take two primes p and q (I think they might only have to be relatively prime), where q >= x. I'll use x=6, p=19 and q=7.<p>Observe multiples of p:\n0,19,38,57,76,95,114<p>Mod them by q:\n0,5,3,1,6,4,2,0...<p>Take the first q results, but drop the ones >= x:\n0,5,3,1,4,2<p>If you want a different series, just use a different p. You can skip any number of initial results if you want to start somewhere later in the state space.<p>I guess it's worth noting that selection of p and q makes a difference to how ""random"" it looks -- if p and q are only 1 apart, it will just count up from 0, etc. I don't have a good intuition for what values produce ""random""-looking results.<p>And yeah, this method is definitely not cryptographically secure in any way.<p>(Any number theorists around to tell me this is a stupid idea?)<p>Edit: this isn't that great, because the pattern is obvious (19 == -2 mod 7) so it's equivalent to subtracting 2 each time. Maybe if you pick a q three times the size of your x (15) and still drop the ones greater than x, you could get it to look more ""random"". Hmm.",1222198262

For me, any degree of audibility can become very distracting and therefore frustrating.  One exception is when there are so many voices that they become unintelligle; it seems my brain is then ""willing to give up"" and the distraction can be less.  The presence of all that sound is still somewhat distracting and is tiring, but I stop being forced to perceive individual elements of conversation.<p>I'd run across chatterblocker or a similar item but had not tried it.  This is a good reminder to give it a go, the next time I find myself in an appropriate circumstance.<p>I wonder, has anyone found quality recordings of crowds, e.g. of conversation in a busy coffee house or cafe?  In lieu of a computer and program, I've wondered whether such a thing would be useful, but I do not have the recording equipment to make a professional-grade (and therefore, comfortable for long use) recording.<p>In my struggles to get away from work environment noise, I've run across these resources:<p>Direct Sound Extreme Isolation® Headphones<p><a href=""http://www.extremeheadphones.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremeheadphones.com/</a><p>Ear Plug Superstore<p><a href=""http://earplugstore.stores.yahoo.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earplugstore.stores.yahoo.net/</a>",1222197445

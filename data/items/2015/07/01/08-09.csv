See [1].<p>You don&#x27;t have to know everything in any language just to get some work done, a lot of times advanced features are just that: advanced, stuff for doing things a bit more efficiently, or to handle certain rough edge cases. Learn them in their own time, and they&#x27;ll make you better at what you do, but don&#x27;t get wrapped up too much in expecting perfect efficiency from yourself.<p>A lot of programmers seem to be, as a people, kinda bad at this kind of self-reflection, like we&#x27;re all sheep in wolves&#x27; clothing trying to avoid showing a hint of weakness. I know I sure am. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with not knowing something, just try and take a moment learn it when you can.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.jle.im/entry/io-monad-considered-harmful"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jle.im/entry/io-monad-considered-harmful</a>",1435741195

What are the main selling points for Scheme/Racket now?<p>> I am a big believer in functional programming (and static types) for large projects, but there is an undeniable bit of awkwardness compared to just imperatively poking things for small projects.  That is one of the wins for Scheme -- I can make it super-easy to get easy things working, but it isn&#x27;t just a &quot;scripting language&quot; unsuitable for large scale development.  I am going to have to sort out my Racket / Chibi module strategy sometime soon, though.<p>> As far as language choice goes, I don&#x27;t claim to have broadly evaluated every possibility and chosen the optimal one.<p>> Java or C# would have been more familiar to a broader base of game industry developers, but I really didn&#x27;t want to drag in all the bulk of a JVM / .NET system, and a class focused world view seems less suited for the smaller scripting tasks.<p>> Javascript would have been more familiar to a broader base of web industry developers, but I have basically no experience with javascript, and little desire to explore it (which is admittedly a fault of mine).<p>> S-expression reading and writing is a strong factor for network communication, and I like the fact that there are available options for Scheme to interpret / compile / compile-to-C.  I can see valid use cases for all of them, and I&#x27;m not sure how important each will be.<p>> The bottom line is that I have been enjoying myself working with Racket / Scheme this year, and I have evidence that it has been objectively productive for me, so I&#x27;m going out on a bit of a limb and placing a bet on it.<p>> >Initial impression: 7 years after starting to program in Racket, it still surprises me how easy it is to do something\n> >useful in just a few lines of code.<p>> A big goal here is to make the authored code very clear and simple.  I may yet get to a single #lang vr <ip address> declaration that gets rid of the boilerplate at the top and bottom of the file and flips the right switches to make Racket closer to R7RS.<p>> There are sets of creative-types that are learning how to put things together in Unity to accomplish fairly simple media related tasks.

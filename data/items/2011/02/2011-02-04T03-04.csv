2178286,comment,2177172,2178251,0,0,pjscott,,,"I don't know of any pure-Python bcrypt implementation, but App Engine will let you calculate SHA-1 hashes with the built-in hashlib module. To make this slow enough, you'll need to iterate it a bunch of times (at least 1000 is the usual recommendation). Something like this:<p><pre><code>    import hashlib
    
    def slow_hash(password, salt, iterations=2000):
        h = hashlib.sha1()
        h.update(password)
        h.update(salt)
        for x in range(iterations):
            h.update(h.digest())
        return h.digest()
</code></pre>
I haven't tested this code, but hopefully it illustrates the general idea. Repeatedly run the hash function on the output of the previous iteration. You may need to bump up the number of iterations later as computers get faster. It's not as good as bcrypt, but it also doesn't suck, and it should run just fine on App Engine.",1296791747

Granted, they have many people and opinions can differ and vary over time.<p>Secondly, it should be possible to do something as simple as filter out obvious content farm sites in under a week tops. Or give all users a quick and easy to do it. Perhaps have a default blacklist of known content farmers, and then give users the option to remove things from the blacklist when doing their own searches. You might be dealing with a huge company if something as simple as this takes 20k employees more than a week, tops, to put into production. And I'm being generous with the week estimate, because it could be done even faster than that under more agile conditions. And a 'default blacklist of known content farmers' is not even the only solution which could be implemented quickly, you could also do something like add another variable to the PageRank algorithm which has a down weighing effect on any page under a domain known to be a content farmer/spammer. Supposedly, they are already doing this (IIRC) but again, the basic idea could be implemented and put into production quickly, if it hasn't already.",1296791578

2178263,comment,2178056,2178056,0,0,makmanalp,,,"Rock climbing is awesome! It's safe. It's a full body workout. You can do it both indoors and outdoors. No pressure, relaxed and noob friendly environment. You don't have to be very strong and the don't need gear to start. Renting gear at your local gym will do. Progress is measurable (as you get better, you'll find yourself doing higher grades of climbs).<p>All you need is a partner (guy/gal that you trust) and a local climbing gym. Go sign up for intro courses, that'll probably only take a day for the basics. It's really simple. The Boston area has metrorock.<p>Also, hackers will definitely make the connection between solving a ""problem"" in a route and regular problem solving. Most good routes (especially boulder problems) have a crux, where it's really difficult, but the way you get past is usually not by muscle-ing through but doing some unintuitive move that takes a leap of imagination and creativity. After some trials, you'll get the ""aha"" moment.<p>There's bouldering, which is low-height, and you fall on a map. A little more muscle strength required. There's also toproping, where you're climbing high walls but are protected by rope, and a partner belaying you from below. There are a few more styles that you can google if you really want to, that are not quite for beginners.<p>Tips (that you'll ignore anyway but then remember in the future):<p>- It's all about the fingers. After your first day, they will be <i>very</i> sore.<p>- Body positioning and movement is very important. It will reduce your tiring rate, and get you past positions where you can't quite get to the next hold. Watch other (advanced) climbers do their thing. Most won't mind. See how they move around fluidly and gracefully, and try to imitate that.<p>- Muscles will help later on but initially it's not as important as the stuff mentioned above. I have <i>no</i> muscles and I can pull of a decent 5.10-5.11 (ratings start at 5.6-7, and almost exponentially increase in difficulty to 5.15 for world champs.)<p>- Start easy, and try not to go up levels too fast. Many beginners fall into this trap where they already have lots of muscle and they can power through to the higher ratings. This is cool, but if you find yourself doing tons of arm-wrenching pull-ups and slamming your feet and knees into the wall, time to lower a level and practice a bit more until you get the sequences down perfectly.<p>- Practice falling. It'll reduce your fear of falling, and give you that extra boost of confidence to do that freaky move.",1296791168

Have generic options for clothing, since there is a huge turnover in baby clothes at most retailers (BRU doesn't even offer pictures for most clothes on the website) - size and item type (3 month onesie, newborn footy pjs, etc.)<p>2.  Offer some suggested items / basic lists to get people started, or consider more social aspects to let people give feedback on other people's lists - there seems to be a big market for this kind of info (see: baby bargain books).  This might be a way to keep users engaged after they are done with their own list.<p>3.  Have options for non-purchased gifts or other items to be added, like home-cooked meals or babysitting - lots of people wanted to offer these kinds of things<p>4.  Have options for monetary donations - this is how a lot of cultures work (red envelopes for chinese, etc.) and it would be great to support it in one place<p>5.  Provide links to sign up for store registries to get all the freebies they provide for signing up - lots of people love this kind of thing.  This is also a competitive point to consider - the discount stores provide to ""complete"" your registry was a good way to get a discount on the high-ticket items.<p>6.  Consider ways to offer future gifts - diaper subscriptions or clothes for older babies that could arrive in the future so you don't have to worry about storing it and remembering it 6 months later.",1296790067

If you put both the keywords and the link on your blog then it allows Google to independently establish that connection using the merits of their own algorithms.<p>The ""incrimminating"" part here is that Microsoft <i>appears</i> to be intentionally parsing the keywords out of the search.    Which means they are intentionally looking at a click and saying a) this is a google search and here are the terms used and then b) this is a result that Google returned, and they are then using that to fill their own index.   If they generically parsed the URL for terms then you might argue they are not giving Google special treatment, they are just doing this for every page the user goes to.   However that's a bit hard to buy - if they really did that they would end up with all kinds of garbage associations from opaque URLs.   So they must have a signal saying ""this was a google search, treat it better than the others"".  Or they are somewhere in between the two.   It's not clear to me where they fall on this scale - it's generally murky.  At worst, I'd say they are copying, at best, I'd say it's sneaky but clever and fair game.

9092802,comment,9092246,9092693,0,0,swframe,,,"Note there is a hell of lot you can do to make raising kids enormous fun.
1. Play with your kids as if you are a kid too. I mean take it extremely seriously. Leave the smartphone off and join in. Build the most amazing things (sand castles, robots, tree houses, paintings, drawings, etc). Your kids will see you and appear to ignore you and then one day you will see them doing the same thing. 
2. Explore like mad. Visit every place you can think of hanging out. Bike all over. Visit every park in your area, every library, etc. Do it every weekend. Catch bugs. Watch the stars. Hike, camp, boat, etc. 
3. If you code at home, try to code an interest AI problem that has great visuals and then explain it to your kids. 
4. Make movies. Write the script with the kids. Get the kids to act the parts. 
I could go on but I think you get the point. I think you can see that if you stop trying to be an adult, you can have a lot of fun.<p>The biggest problem I have with kids is that they sometimes fight over silly things. I forbade my kids from playing with each other. Since it was against the rules, they played with each other much better and when they fought they knew they were breaking the rules.<p>After watching Monster Inc. I realized that you could tickle kids instead of spanking them to get them to behave. No one likes to be tickled. I can imagine my kids being kicked out of therapy when they explain how they were disciplined by being made to laugh.<p>There are so many tricks that reduce the irritation to a minimum. For me, it was a challenge to find them so I really enjoyed it. I wish I could do it again. My oldest daughter is taking comp sci at stanford.",1424670853

This includes women ...<p>(I don&#x27;t know toolz and a couple sentences written one Sunday on Hacker News don&#x27;t represent him as a person. The following is only about the words, which are a good example to work from.)<p>It&#x27;s hard to escape our own perspectives; it&#x27;s a skill that takes learning and work. For example, these words are meant well and on one level seem fine, but unfortunately in my experience they are just another roadblock:<p>* &quot;love for ... women&quot;: &#x27;Love&#x27; probably isn&#x27;t the best word to use in this context! Combined with the rest, it conveys that the women still are primarily objects of sex or romance, not engineers to be taken seriously, not people you respect and don&#x27;t want to mess around with.<p>* &quot;I see nothing but love for technically capable women.&quot; This objectifies the women. (If you don&#x27;t know the concept, it&#x27;s one of the most powerful, important, revelatory ideas I&#x27;ve learned regarding understanding others.) First, someone else is taking a bunch of individuals, putting them in a box, and slapping a label on; whether it&#x27;s a positive or negative label makes little difference. Imagine if someone said &#x27;we love black people here&#x27;, that would suck if you were black. Some people are assholes, some are funny, some flakey, some arrogant, some kind, some don&#x27;t want your &quot;love&quot; ... form opinions on and relationships with one person at a time, just like guys.<p>* &quot;Sure, everyone loves to play immature every now and again and make crude jokes. This includes women ...&quot; People make this mistake all the time. Yes, the minority laughs and say it&#x27;s all right, but they have no choice. Nobody wants to be the one person complaining when everyone else is having fun (and usually it&#x27;s fruitless anyway), nobody wants to be labeled a whiner or trouble-maker, and if you are in the minority your social status is tenuous anyway -- you have to constantly prove yourself to be &#x27;one of the guys&#x27;. Object and will you find yourself on the inside on the next project? Promoted? Find someone who has been in that position, who would confide in you, and ask how they liked it; in my experience, they have not liked it at all.<p>Also, people get their morals from their peers (we&#x27;re sheep, we follow the herd; again, nobody wants to be the lone objecter). Every time you make that sexist joke and everyone laughs, it communicates a standard: It&#x27;s ok to discriminate against women. I love crude jokes, but maybe play them on the majority or play non-gender-oriented crude jokes on the women (maybe a fart joke?).",1424669831

In a world of HSTS, why on earth should non-programmers have to click through a kludgy GUI for each of hundreds of CAs just to avoid trusting Chinese, Turkmenistani and various other CAs with no warnings by default? This seems like an area ripe for extension development; e.g. with something like RequestPolicy&#x27;s categories defined by geography, level of paranoia, etc. - or AdBlock Edge&#x27;s subscription lists. Firefox could pretty easily incorporate Certificate Patrol functionality and make it more usable for less technical users. And so on.<p>Companies producing this sort of malware deserve to be punished for misleading their customers and putting them at risk, but perhaps another solution is to pressure browser vendors to start thinking about the way crypto gets used with a lot more nuance as a potential attack surface, and from whose vantage point MITM confers <i>transitive risk</i>. When vendors leave those sorts of backdoors quietly open for corporate DPI, users often lose control over who <i>else</i> might try to use a similar type of backdoor.<p>There may be a legal difference between corporate DPI and Privdog, but we should stop pretending that there&#x27;s a huge technical or ethical distinction between Privdog and browser vendors turning a blind eye to silent DPI against someone who does not get a say in it, and often does not even know about it.<p>Browser vendors hide behind &#x27;compatibility&#x27; excuses for crappy defaults and glaringly absent warnings in much the same way PrivDog misleads people; browser vendors just tend to commit sins of <i>omission</i> rather than commission.",1424669636

9092711,comment,9084000,9090466,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"> No, the original claim was that annexation started before the 21st.<p>Sorry. Yes. The original claim was that the annexation started before the 21st. Girkin&#x27;s presence in the Crimea before the 21st (which didn&#x27;t happen) was supposed to be evidence of that. Much of how to interpret the dates depends to some understanding of territorial sovereignty, and also of course whether Girkin et al should count as active military personnel (we agree yes only on the second).<p>The other evidence was the metal for the return of the Crimea, but I can not find any source indicated it awarded or existed before February 21st (can you?).<p>> At that moment it wasn&#x27;t disputed even by the Kremlin. The &quot;disputing&quot; would come a bit later.<p>It&#x27;s status has been disputed in modern history since at least 1991 when Crimea declared itself an independent autonomous state. I would agree that if you believed that the Crimea was not an autonomous state that it was an invasion of Ukraine. Named &quot;Autonomous Republic of Crimea&quot; and recognizing its history it&#x27;s hard to argue that - and it fact it was the Crimean Parliament (not the Ukrainian Parliament) that was seized. But the issue is of course incredibly complicated and obviously closely guarded and considered by both the Russian Federation and the Ukraine. The jury (&quot;international community&quot;), unfortunately, is one that is led by powers with a direct interest in a result that benefits their objectives.<p>Bubbling up, though, I want to mention again that while this is an interesting area of international law, it contributes only little to the main deliberation.<p>> Come on, man. TASS and RT would claim that the Ukrainian military is crucifying infants in Donbass and drinking their blood for breakfast. I&#x27;m sorry, I can&#x27;t trust anything that comes from them about Ukraine. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (mid.ru) is just a propaganda front for the Kremlin.<p>Could you expound on how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [1] is a propaganda front for the Kremlin, while the State Department is not a propaganda front for the Executive Branch? (If you were to agree that the State Department was, in fact, a propaganda front - something we could have a very serious and evidenced conversation about - I could understand what you mean. Or maybe I don&#x27;t understand how the institutions are different [school me]). Similar to what I will write below, propaganda outlets almost always tell some form of the truth (just truth that is beneficial). There&#x27;s tons of propaganda on both sides. Maybe we could find some nonpartisan criteria for entering in information from sources that have been known to propagandize?<p>Can you show where TASS or RT have claimed such ridiculous things - the danger here would be putting words into a straw man&#x27;s mouth. I totally get that TASS and RT run stories that directly benefit Russia and that, like many Western news organizations, spin news for their people. I get that you may not trust it for this reason. But this would be a reason too not to trust many sources I bet you would be willing to enter into the web of evidence to find consistent evidences narratives from.<p>Regarding RT/TASS: like any good propaganda outlet it needs to use almost exclusively white propaganda - you&#x27;ll get the same from the Washington Post and Voice of America. In any case, for this particular story its numbers match funding and deployment numbers confirmed later by sources you do trust almost exactly - it would be a kind of strange coincidence for something like that to happen. There&#x27;s also still the other reporting, for instance from Luders, which you haven&#x27;t replied to I think need to be called out again lest they disappear into the ASCII tide.<p>> I&#x27;m sorry but that&#x27;s beside the point. (regarding CSOs)<p>UNITED and USAID (and Soros, etc) are NOT besides the point and made up the vast majority of the content here. Please do not reply only to the CSO section. The documents all speak quite a bit about funding and cooperation of NGOs. You may consider CSOs another (sister) point that is evidence of Western support of political coup that needs a response of their own, not evidence about NGOs.<p>The enumeration of NGOs seems to be of interest to you. As I specified in the previous post this would take some time, and may even be a doomed project. Perhaps you would like to help in an enumeration?<p>[[Because I&#x27;m sure the conversation needs this at this point]]<p>The meta argument (all the way at the top) being made here is whether the West played any significant role in encouraging political disruption and installing leadership that benefited its policy decisions. It may be interesting for both of us to review the branches of argumentation therein and include important pieces of the argument that were silently dropped by the other, and to reform and submit larger arguments where the details have reached a consensus.<p>I do think the answer is most assuredly yes. I think you may too - though you&#x27;ll specify that the way it was done was legal or primarily nonviolent. If this is the case, please let me know whether you would still like to continue discussing details and controversial topics, as I am willing to.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(R...</a>",1424669043

9092705,comment,9092246,9092246,0,0,steven2012,,,"1) You will have to continue studying and learning for the rest of your career, unless you want to be easily replaceable.  If you want to be easily employable with a great job and great salary past the age of 45, you can&#x27;t just be a coder.  You need to be a tech lead, architect, etc, someone that can lead so that you add value in ways other than coding.  If you are a coder at the age of 45, you have to be significantly better than someone who is half your age and half you salary to keep employed.  An average, or below average coder at age 45 is not easily employable, at least in Silicon Valley.<p>2) Salaries for pure coders flatline around the age of 35, unless the entire industry&#x27;s salary range goes up like it has over the last 5 years.  There is a sweet spot of experience between 8-10 years, and companies don&#x27;t value 20 years experience more than 10 years experience.  The industry simply isn&#x27;t the same 10-20 years ago as it is today.  The only significant difference that I bring to the table over an 32 year old coder is that my code is probably incrementally more reliable and my manual testing abilities are probably incrementally better, but for the most part, the differences are intangible and definitely not enough to justify a salary increase.<p>3) Take care of your body.  Age is not just a number.  Practice good eating habits and do not gain weight because it becomes much harder to lose as you age.  Your body goes through physical changes from your early 30s, and you are weaker.  My memory is significantly worse now than it was 10 years ago, and often forget things that I&#x27;ve known for 10-20 years.  My body is significantly weaker than it was even 5 years back.<p>4)  Learning how to be personable and sociable will help accelerate and lengthen your career.  No one wants to be around someone who is a technical genius but an asshole.  They would rather hire someone who is very good, but great to work with.<p>5) Customers don&#x27;t care about technology, they care about solutions.

And never a search, regardless. In the article, stops of over an hour were mentioned. That&#x27;s not reasonable in the court&#x27;s opinion even as it stands now. Honestly though, I do not see the situation improving until the courts essentially reverse themselves and realize what horrific mistakes they&#x27;ve made in regards to the fourth amendment in the past. And while I&#x27;m being honest, I don&#x27;t see that ever happening. I like the idea of a no-go zone, but while that might solve specific instances of abuse, it will not address the systematic abuse that the police have created in this country. Perhaps if we had a separate police to police the police instead of foolishly allowing them to police themselves we could reach some justice. This is also something that I do not see happening in this country as most people do not realize how horrific the police really are because they&#x27;re white and will never experience it first hand.

Smaller sites would be the winners.<p>You could also more easily implement time-delayed transactions. Make to order-deliveries sometimes don't charge up front, but instead opt to charge when they're about to deliver. If you (the seller) could send a simple SMS asking for payment, or phone a number when you (the buyer) got the invoice instead of having to sign in with your bank on your computer it'd make life easier for at least some people.",1259056551

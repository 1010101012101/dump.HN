The problem with this approach is you often penalize people who are truly curious and not trolls.<p>If you were to allow the masses to determine whether a question is a troll question or not, using an OR, allowing anyone to flip the bit, then almost every question would be considered a troll question. You get a lot of false positives.<p>Providing a thorough, quality answer to a troll question won&#x27;t help advance that troll&#x27;s career, they will pay the price later, for sure, when their intellect is on the line.<p>Providing a trolly answer, and treating the question asker as insincere will inevitably treat a sincere person like shit, and turn them off entirely from entire genres and disciplines.<p>Treat resources as sincere, and those who wish to abuse them for temporary short term gain will, and I am very confident about this, end up fucking themselves over.<p>*If you downvote this, please let me know what you disagree with, I&#x27;m open to debate.",1388195840

Bottom third is pushing your luck for places like Valdosta State, and even the STEM people I knew there had trouble landing real engineering jobs.

When I ask medical doctors about that (my wife is one, for example), their main reason for supporting the &quot;Dr&quot; title is that it creates a sort of formal separation between the patient and the doctor which keeps things professional, similar to how we had to call our elementary teachers &quot;Mr&quot; or &quot;Ms&quot;. I don&#x27;t buy that argument; for example, why wouldn&#x27;t that apply equally to nurses? To me, it&#x27;s seems like a trick for lending them an artificial air of authority.<p>I know a lot of people with PhDs, but I can&#x27;t think of any who want to be called &quot;Doctor&quot;, because that&#x27;s exceedingly silly.

Let the market decide whether they want the original or fakes. Even the original creator shouldn&#x27;t have a say on whether other people buy and sell derivatives (or even direct copies!) of the creator&#x27;s work.<p>The only thing I care about is truth. If you make a claim X, e.g. branding your item as in a trademark, then it should be true. But I see no harm in allowing products that do not make any false claim at all.<p>Abstract art doesn&#x27;t belong to the creator. Once it&#x27;s published it has a life of its own, like a mathematical proof of a theorem. The only thing that is yours is the claim that you did it. I wish the world worked this way. We&#x27;d see more innovation in everything.<p>The whole patent/copyright thing, I find absurd.<p>For patents, imagine if the population were a million times greater than it is now, some staggering number. Would you feel comfortable with a patent system then? Probably anything you could come up with would infringe marginally upon another&#x27;s protected under a temporary monopoly. People would be shut out from selling anything at all, except those who already had resources to discover new inventions.<p>Copyright is different because perhaps the scope of possible interesting discoveries or inventions is much broader so anybody could participate and create something unique. But even then, who is the creator of abstract art to tell others to <i>not</i> derive joy or economic sustenance from his/her creations? As long as the transactions were based upon truth, e.g. no lying about who the creator is, ideally with correct attribution, then it&#x27;s none of anybody else&#x27;s business! If the consumer wants to purchase &quot;fake&quot; fan-fiction, just take it in stride. It does not affect you, your creative ability, nor your economic condition.",1388195393

Many political philosophies attract hoards of what I call &quot;SWE Groupies.&quot; When you apply the Small World Effect to political philosophy, you will find that you can easily blame all the worlds problems on anything you want (the government, the patriarchy, the market, etc) because everything is interconnected. Based on purely anecdotal evidence, it seems that almost everyone who eventually wanders away from the political philosophy they were born into falls into the trap of blaming exactly one of these entities when the usual state of affairs is that they all hold blame to an uneven and debatable extent that changes depending on the issue in question. The worst result of such naivete is that it creates blind spots. Libertarians fail to propose measures to control market failures, socialists fail to propose measures to control bureaucracy, etc. In any case, most people are eventually confronted with enough counterexamples to shake them out of their blind faith and they move on to a mix-and-match philosophy that proposes systems more similar to real, proven governments (funny how that works).<p>This leaves the problem of finding a label for yourself, which can no longer be done in an absolutely precise manner. Milton Friedman, a &quot;philosophically mature&quot; libertarian, might agree with a devout socialist on a great many things (giving money to poor people), even though they identify with philosophies that look like polar opposites to the corresponding SWE Groupies. I bet that you show segments of the video I linked to SWE Libertarians and get them to swear up and down that this guy was a socialist.<p>People like Milton Friedman don&#x27;t deserve to be lumped with people like Ayn Rand, and just because SV is infested with SWE Groupies of the libertarian persuasion (it&#x27;s convenient to be a libertarian when the market is smiling upon your profession) doesn&#x27;t mean that you won&#x27;t find yourself on the wrong end of a political philosophy debate if you attack libertarianism as a whole rather than individual points raised in the argument.",1388194009

Economy is more important in this mindset.<p>North Korea sinks a South Korean ships and kills 50 sailors and then proceeds to shell an island. South Korea&#x27;s response is to do absolutely nothing but look to United States for &quot;what do we do now&quot; because their capital is in the artillery firing range of North Korea. The difference is that this time South Korean president Lee Myung Bak ordered airstrike but the South Korean air force generals replied by saying they need American permission, essentially suggesting South Korean president is not really in charge of it&#x27;s own military in the time of need.<p>It seems like whenever South Korea doesn&#x27;t want to take action on North, United States is willing. When United States is unwilling, South Korea is willing. A stark reminder that two countries, although an alliance forged with blood spilled during the Korean War, cannot share the same national interests because in the end, they are two different countries, with different culture and perspective.<p>If you are not willing to pay the price for reunification now, you certainly won&#x27;t be able to reap the benefits of a reunification when it inevitably happens.",1388192992

Images adapted from a PD work then should be allowed, provided there is no effort made to use that image in an otherwise infringing way.<p>Of course you can be sued for anything and DC Comics would most likely enact a very expensive lawsuit - in a sane legal system however they should probably lose, especially if they were attempting to use their trademark to prevent the release of material which would have been copyright infringing before the lapse of the copyright term.<p>If the estate of a creator of a work can use TM law to prevent PD works from being adapated and used then that cancels the deal made in copyright between the state and the creator whereby the works have a presumption of fully entering the public domain.<p>[Does anyone know of any caselaw covering situations where a major element of once copyrighted - but now PD - works is also a valid trademark?]",1388192589

Not that it&#x27;s hard to code safely, but sometimes the most obvious way to e.g. access a database is the unsafe way (which is partly just because there&#x27;re a lot of old libraries and bad advice floating around). Charset handling is a similar area; I&#x27;ve seen lots of PHP code that appears to work fine but goes wrong when given non-ascii characters. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there were similar issues with timezones, though I haven&#x27;t dealt with them enough in PHP to be sure.<p>Well in my case we work on mobile apps so the client doesn&#x27;t do anything unexpected with respect to character sets and time zones. Probably that&#x27;s harder when working with random web browsers.

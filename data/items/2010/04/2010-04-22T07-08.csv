1284427,comment,1284017,1284017,0,0,gizmo,,,"I agree with the premise (video games can be art), but I find his arguments unconvincing.<p>Some games I consider art because of the story, the immersion, and so on. From the top of my head: <i>PlaneScape: Torment</i>, and perhaps <i>The Longest Journey</i>. These games are great because they are great novels, and <i>more</i>.<p>Other games, such as <i>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</i> (the one by LucasArts) and <i>Grim Fandango</i> I consider art because they are <i>great movies</i> and more. It's really more of an interactive movie than a game. Watching somebody play games like this is almost as much fun as playing it yourself.<p>Some games I consider art because they make me stop and think. <i>Sanatarium</i> for instance.<p>On the other end of the spectrum you can have a game like <i>Super Mario</i>. Mario is reductionist. Everything that can be left out, is left out. You walk, you run, you jump. There is no story, you don't need one. I imagine people will still play and enjoy Super Mario 30 years from now, perhaps a 100 years from now. If a game stands the test of time like that, it almost <i>must</i> be art by definition.<p>A great game, when you pick it up, can immediately blow you away because it's <i>just that good</i>. In the same way a painting can take your breath away or keep you captivated for hours. Music can do this to you too. Paintings, Music and Games can be art because the artists can decide what to leave in and what to take away. They completely own the medium, and so the artist owns the experience.<p>With movies, this isn't the case. They're clumsy because there are too many details, too many uncontrollable factors, too many budgetary issues. Movies are never <i>perfect</i>. No matter how great a movie is, there are always jarring imperfections. But if there is a perfect movie, a movie that can't be improved upon, that can be <i>really</i> considered art... you'd probably end up with a movie from Pixar.",1271922197

    cliché. It has created living characters that respond like humans,

Developers, are inherently the casualty to a hyper-consumerist marketplace.<p>There was a time when the iPhone first came out that I would mock it as a ""Playschool phone for idiots with huge buttons telling you what to do"".

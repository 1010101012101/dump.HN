Also, magnetic confinement fusion reactors don&#x27;t explode, they are like pencils balanced on their points, when something goes wrong or they &quot;lose containment&quot; the pencil falls over, the fusion conditions dissipate and reactions stop. This test was just one step along the way of verifying the plasma dynamics and heating capabilities of the system, it&#x27;ll be a while before they do fusion reactions, and it will never produce energy from fusion. But be aware that making fusion reactions happen is easy, it&#x27;s the matter of creating a self-sustaining fusion reaction that&#x27;s hard.<p>In magnetic confinement fusion there is a big problem of confinement stability. You are trying to confine a plasma, which is electrically charged and thus an electrical conductor. Electric current generates a magnetic field. This is actually made use of in tokamak designs, which are the most straightforward magnetic confinement systems. However, tokamaks suffer from a fundamental flaw, that plasma current produces a feedback instability loop making it very challenging to attain plasma confinement longer than a few seconds or minutes. That&#x27;s problematic because the shorter lived the fusion plasma is the more the initial (externally produced) heat as a proportion of the total cumulative heat of the plasma over its lifetime adds up. Short lived plasmas don&#x27;t spend very long producing fusion heat to &quot;pay back&quot; the energy used to heat up the plasma to fusion conditions to start with.<p>A stellarator is basically a way to twist the magnetic fields around the fusion plasma tube in such a way so that the trajectories of ions in the plasma will stay inside the confinement volume, without requiring any current in the plasma. This makes the system potentially much more stable but at the cost of a very much more complex arrangement of magnets. The longer the plasma can be confined the longer fusion reactions can be sustained, making it easier to generate more power than was put in to raise the plasma to fusion suitable conditions (high density, high temperature).",1454581144

That gives you a good signal that you&#x27;re doing something right. These days it&#x27;s 90/10 or 9000/1000. The signal is still the same, it&#x27;s only the scale that&#x27;s different.<p>But we don&#x27;t – maybe can&#x27;t – feel that way. 1000 people calling you names feels terrible even if that&#x27;s a tiny proportion of the whole. To feel otherwise would mean scaling the value of each individual opinion, each person, down to an insignificant level.<p>Numbers like upvote counts are pretty good for that, it&#x27;s hard to picture the human life behind each click when all you see is (+200). But messages, even short ones, leave a lot of the human in there.<p>Of course, even if we could consistently eliminate the human importance of messages we receive, I&#x27;m not sure that would leave us better off. It&#x27;s hard to believe that what internet discourse needs is less humanity.<p>Maybe a way to do it would be to representatively sample the messages. So you turn the 9000/1000 back into 9/1 by merely deleting 99.9% of messages as they come in. That feels a bit unjust, like your message is arbitrarily thrown away as soon as you write it, but in a de facto way that&#x27;s probably similar to how messages get filtered now.<p>Another alternative would be to summarise each kind of message with a number attached to it indicating how many people said a similar thing. It would be possible, though not easy, to do that automatically if you designed your whole system around it. Reddit kinda sorta works this way, and I know political types use a similar process to manage constituents&#x27; opinions.<p>One thing seems obvious to me, though: we want massive connectedness and scale, we want everyone to feel like their individual voice is heard, and we want to not be crushed by impossibly massive waves of human noise.<p>I don&#x27;t think we can have all three.",1454580088

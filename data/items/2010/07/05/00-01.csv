Second, what expectations are you setting for yourself?  If your self-vision is not meeting reality, that's a major cause of disappointment right there.  Change your self-vision.  Third, who said anything is ""wrong"" with you?  People have different temperaments.  Some people bond tightly with others, some do not.  As long as you're not harboring sociopathic or homicidal thoughts that prevent you sticking to others, it's not much to worry about.  Fourth, in regards to expectations, do you imagine what <i>others</i> might expect from you -- and this is the underlying reason to avoid them?  Does having to see other people feel like confronting a school test, with that sinking feeling you're being put on the spot and might fail?  Well, that's shyness.  Medicine claims to have a pill for that, but I really don't trust mind pills (all pills have revenge effects sooner or later).  Lastly, you are young.  The opportunities available to you are many -- perhaps too many.  Whittle down everything to what you really love and want to do.  Once you've got that settled (and this won't happen in just one day, so be patient), once you know your passion, everything else falls into place on its own -- because you will naturally gravitate to people who share that and being around them won't feel like a test.  One other thing.  You might want to read <i>The Outsiders</i> by Colin Wilson.  This will give you some insight into just how different people can be -- but that didn't stop any of the people in that book from gaining prominence.  I hope some of this helped.",1278290984

1486765,comment,1486594,1486717,0,0,revolvingcur,,,"From someone raised in the Christian church:<p>I was taught from a very young age certain things about God and man: that God was all-knowing and all-powerful; that God was the creator of everything; that man was irrevocably prone to sin and therefore needed a savior; that God chose certain people to save; that heaven was the ultimate destination for those who were saved; etc...<p>As I grew older, I began to realize that other people had substantially different beliefs from the ones with which I had been inculcated. This was a realization only because I had been intentionally isolated from people who thought differently from my parents and educators. I noticed that what these different belief systems had in common was their moral program. All Abrahamic religions, and many others, prescribe how people ought to behave. But this moral program is not much different from common sense under conditions of abundance. The ways in which they differ are more interesting and are mostly tuned to ensure their adherents perpetuate the system.<p>So, with this in hand, it became readily apparent that the bulk of organized religion was a historical artifact from the time when peoples of old were figuring out how to treat one another (back at the emergence of what we term ""civilization""). It is possible (and in my opinion, now necessary) to separate moral education from religious indoctrination since, ironically, much of the unrest in civilization is now caused by the differences in religious prescription rather than differences in morality.<p>Either that, or religious thought reeks of delusion and lacks any evidence whatsoever for what it claims. Seriously, I don't know any religious person who can demonstrate any reason for their belief other than indoctrination. Prove me wrong.",1278290600

I've since self-diagnosed myself with that 'condition' and went looking for info which would help me learn more about that.  There's no 'magic bullet cure', but that bit of self-knowledge has helped me avoid situations which I knew would make me miserable, and have slowly forged a better, more fulfilling life (though even now, I keep changing my goal posts).<p>The biggest thing I learned from that little journey is that there's nothing 'wrong' (in an absolute sense) with that condition - it's just different.<p>If you'd care to discuss any of this further, please ping me at any time at mgkimsal@gmail.com or 919-827-4724.",1278290533

Store it in an internal representation that's only capable of the minimum needed formatting features. (There's no actual HTML left at this stage. It's equivalent to any other DSL.) Then render HTML out of that parse tree, so that every bit of user input is HTML entity-encoded, and everything else (tags and attributes) comes from constants in the program.<p>This can be even more secure than regexp-based DSL translators that build up a result from input in multiple passes, since they tend to lack such a well-defined separation between input text and output HTML.",1278290311

1486752,comment,1485922,1485922,0,0,siglesias,,,"Perhaps a longer blog post needs to be dedicated to this, but  I feel like much of the debate between iOS and Android focuses on the ""fundamental differences"" between Apple's particular approach (or call it philosophy) to mobile computing, and Google's. This might be a bit controversial, but I find it NOT an open and shut case that an ""open, customizable"" platform is an advantage.<p>Throughout history we've been struggling with the Google/iOS problem, but the debate took on different forms: totalitarian versus democratic government, planned economy versus ""free"" economy, big government versus small government. The question is: should certain kinds of decisions affecting a state be centralized or dispersed? In theory, dispersed power (among citizens, or users) should win the day, IF NOT for inevitable market inefficiencies (information asymmetries, NOISE, emotional human irrationality) and malicious private agents who prey on the uninformed. There is an argument to be made that computing platforms fall under this debate. I would argue that Google's open platform also makes it vulnerable to far too many exploits: viruses, buggy, crashing, battery-draining software, and adware that might indiscriminately display pornography. All for certain powers of customizability that I (and many others) find trivial. Like choosing system fonts and having video wallpaper.<p>If everybody in the world had the means to discriminate between spam software and non, then I would think that a system under which anybody could post software targeting any part of the system would be an excellent thing. But they can't. WE, as hackers can. Maybe. But for a majority of the people, they must enter into a ""social contract"" with a curator wherein decisions of quality and security are made for them in exchange for a price premium equal to or less than the value of time saved in ""not worrying"" about malicious code. Beautifully, this space is evolving to a cycle of two year hardware refreshes (less than that for hardcore users), and these serve as market voting mechanisms for the job or efficacy of the curator (in this case, Apple and Google).<p>In the United States (which some would argue is the apotheosis of enlightenment thinking of the government problem) we have deferred legislative power to a body that we pay to do the thinking for us. We cycle through this body periodically democratically (as we can in mobile). We certainly don't have time to ponder over the minutiae of certain articles of legislation. In the same way, I would argue, I don't have time to discriminate between one piece of software for compatibility, reliability, security and quality, and another making nearly identical claims to functionality. Maybe you do, and that's why you choose Android. Meanwhile, I'll trade certain features for peace of mind.",1278290110

I really want to do that in the most immediate possible way.<p>Any suggestions? Should I look for something specific to where I can travel? What else can I do?<p>Thank you very much.<p>(this is throwaway account, I have been a long time hn user)",1278288589

1486690,comment,1485319,1486546,0,0,jashkenas,,,"CoffeeScript is just for fun -- it's a thought experiment that tries to see how far we can run with JavaScript semantics towards a more usable language.<p>Apart from the fact that both compile to JavaScript, CoffeeScript and Objective-J don't really sit together in the same boat. Objective-J is an actual runtime and interpreter: every single method you call is intercepted and handled by ""objj_msgSend"", so that things like method_missing are possible. See:<p><a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-language-abstractions/#comment-323770"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-language-abstractions/#comm...</a><p>CoffeeScript limits itself to current common patterns of JavaScript in practice, and (in a perfect world) would compile 1-to-1 into the JavaScript you <i>would</i> have written. Unlike an implementation of Ruby or Python in JavaScript, where even simple things like numbers work quite differently, the semantics of CoffeeScript are just JavaScript semantics -- so there shouldn't be anywhere for the abstraction to leak.<p>As to sticking to a single common syntax -- that's a very good argument, and I'd have hesitations introducing CoffeeScript into a team project. But if you just want to play around with a fun way to write JS. I encourage you to give it a spin. For an example, take a peek at this implementation of the Buddhabrot fractal (the render will peg your CPU, so use Chrome):<p><a href=""http://jashkenas.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/buddhabrot/buddhabrot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jashkenas.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/buddhabrot/buddhabrot...</a><p>Here's the CoffeeScript that runs it:<p><a href=""http://gist.github.com/463880"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/463880</a><p>And here's the compiled JS (not too different):<p><a href=""http://gist.github.com/463881"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/463881</a>",1278288452

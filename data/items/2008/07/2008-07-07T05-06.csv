It adjusts to anyone who sits in it, so it can be used by multiple people and the settings are extremely easy to set, unlike the Aeron.<p>For the eco-conscious, it's also 99% recyclable and is easy to assemble/disassemble. Then there are the looks, which I find much more appealing than most chairs.",1215410362

It is true that count( * ) without a WHERE clause is much faster in MyISAM than in Innodb (or Postgres), but that is a different optimization (count( * ) => metadata lookup, not count( 1 ) => count( * )).",1215410256

Where where you on the 4th of July when black folk of all economic backgrounds were out cooking out outside across America, with their families  and enjoying Being a Family my Friend?<p>And he said: >>If you ever watch a black family (and this holds trues from Latinos whom I’ve spent time with as well) they spend much more time worrying about the material and outwardly appearance — driving the right car, clothes, accessories, hair, etc. Paul alludes several times throughout the essay (and indeed, in his response,<<<p>Naw, this ain't right either because my son, aged 16 (and we all black right) spent a lot of time learning how to drive Boston streets, thru downtown, into Cambridge, past Somerville and back to our burbs and all the way along we discussed why all the music he was playing on the car CD sounded to me like ""FALL OUT BOY"" or ""HAWTHORNE HEIGHTS"" and he said -- Daddy now, its all original! His playlist has several hundred tracks, mostly different bands...<p>""I know it is but I'm sorry son, I said, but with some exceptions in the tracks playing, I haven't heard anything original from your 52 track playlist, that to me did not sound like FALL OUT BOY or HAWTHORNE HEIGHTS.""<p>So, he defended it over and over and said - ""No, they don't 'em sound like them dad.""  Yeah, right. I listen to over a hundred new tracks every month, all genres and I do know better!!<p>I was itching to get some RAP/HIP HOP even if it was that hypnotic track by Lil Wayne talking about Lolipops.<p>Personally, I love the FOB, HH stuff but I don't want to give overdue credits to their copiers!  Well, he does and so went the discussion.<p>That's a small diverse taste of Black Life from BLACK NERDS in America Mr. davidadewumi! Your piece screamed of a lack of diversity in the African American American family.<p>So, you are right and you are so wrong too, which is my ultimate conclusion -- you like a viewpoint that adequately explains how diverse we all are, no matter what color we are.",1215409442

238351,comment,238325,238339,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>But there are a significant number of hackers who are good at graphic design.</i><p>Righteous argument.  If painting, as an art form, has been replaced by graphic design, then clearly there is significant overlap, and probably on the same order as musicians.  I don't know how much I believe ""painters"", as a class, have become ""designers"", since almost none of the painters I knew in high school (I went to a school for fine arts, so I knew a lot of painters) have since become digital artists, but that may be just a sign of my age...I was among the last generation of kids that didn't grow up using computers daily.<p>Anyway, as I mentioned, I think the primary problem is that ""painters"" is too specific...though it makes for a better title than ""Hackers and People Who Make Art of Some Kind"".  When you open it up to include designers and other visual artists, musicians (like Knuth, who has a massive pipe organ in his house and plays it beautifully), and writers, the overlap becomes very nearly 100%.  Every hacker of note that I can think of off the top of my head has at least one of these as a hobby, particularly if you allow ""visual arts"" to include things like robotics, DIY electronics with an artistic purpose, 3D modeling, etc.  As you've said, hackers are makers, and it often spills over into other kinds of production.",1215409295

238349,comment,238325,238339,0,0,wheels,,,"As a hacker / musician and one who's tried my hand at painting, at least painting as it exists in culture at the moment tends to be less analytical than current approaches to music (which are very analytical).  I think the balance might be shifted if we were looking at painting in for instance the Bauhaus movement, or classical painting.<p>That said, as someone who's also pretty serious about music and hacking, while there are similarities in being able to work from an idea and bring that to realization, there are gaps in that programming is functional; music needn't be.  In that I see programming as closer to architecture than to painting or music.",1215408547

238343,comment,238320,238320,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm not sure I understand.  It's premised on ""vim users who can customize vim with C programming"", but I've never used C once in my ten years of using vim--customizations are generally done using vim script, which is sort of like working in csh or bash.  And, it rarely takes more than a half dozen or so lines to do just about anything I've ever wanted to do (though some complex scripts are much longer, of course).<p>So, technically this is really the ""best explanation of why the creator of this image mistakenly believes Emacs is better than vim"".",1215408144

It was, literally, mind expanding. Suddenly an entire class of problems that I simply could not think about before were, well, not <i>easy</i> necessarily but possible. An experience like that is needed at a younger age.",1215408066

238339,comment,238325,238334,0,0,pg,,,"Interesting question.  Probably one reason there are a lot more hacker/musicians than hacker/painters is that there are a lot more musicians than painters.   Painting is not exactly a flourishing field at the moment.  But there are a significant number of hackers who are good at graphic design.<p>The thing I was saying hackers and painters had in common was that they're both makers.  As opposed to the idea prevalent when I was in college, that programming was applied math.  I believe it was in protest against this idea that Knuth called his books <i>The Art of Computer Programming.</i>",1215407688

238334,comment,238325,238325,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've always felt the painters connection was too tightly focused, though I think this essay (which is ancient, and would either be more true of pg's work today or less depending on how much you agree with it) goes overboard and manages to miss the point.<p>The bone that I do think can be picked with Hackers and Painters is that there just aren't very many hackers who are also painters.  In fact, I only know one: pg.  I know literally dozens of hackers who are musicians and four who are writers (oh, wait...pg makes it five).  It seems to me that if the two categories of people were so alike, there would be significant overlap, but there is very little that I'm aware of.  If you take ""creative, systematic, and challenging pursuits"" as a whole, however, you begin to see a lot more overlap (and again, musicians overlap a <i>lot</i> with hackers, moreso than any other ""creative, systematic, and challenging pursuit"").<p>Maybe because I'm a musician and a hacker (by some definition of ""musician"" and ""hacker"") I'm seeing all of these connections in the same way that pg, who is a painter and a hacker, sees connections between his two loves.  It all makes sense when you're looking at your own likes and dislikes, but nobody else will really understand exactly what you see in your hobbies.",1215407202

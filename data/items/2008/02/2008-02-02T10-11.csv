108313,comment,108115,108115,0,0,fendale,,,"I have been toiling away for what seems like ages on a source code review app, aimed at helping cube dwellers who can code sort out some of the horrible outsourced code they have to review (something I have to do in my cube too often, and was frustrated with the tools out there to do it).<p>Its just a part time thing for me these days (still stuck in my cube), but I hope to get a beta release out there in a month or so.  Things that are making me nervous/holding me back:<p>* Can't come up with a decent name for thing!<p>* While I don't think my app is ugly, its certainly not anywhere near as shiny as many of the other web 2.0 apps out there<p>* I keep tweaking and adding features instead of polishing what is there and getting the beta finished.<p>I am pretty pleased with what I have go so far, so at the least I will have learned Rails and created a tool I can use in my current day job.",1201949226

108310,comment,108282,108282,0,0,DarrenStuart,,,"I think a TC post is worth nothing to most startup unless<p>1. you are targeting thier audience<p>2. you are after hype to get some VC's interested<p>3. you are targeting a mainstream audience and hope that other bloggers or mainstream media will pick you up after seeing you on TC<p>You are better off targetting blogs aimed at your target audience.<p>A blog with 2000 readers is going to have more value and be easier to get coverage on.<p>Anyone know of any where that list these b and c list bloggers by niche? I would pay for that list.",1201948530
108309,comment,107771,107771,0,0,Tichy,,,"I for one think it is a good idea. Maybe with Microsoft's start page, Yahoo search could get more traffic and the recognition it deserves. Microsoft Online Services could be scraped completely, nobody would miss them.<p>Server tech would be a concern, but who knows - perhaps rather than switching everything to Windows servers, Microsoft might take the chance to become acquainted with Linux and BSD. It would make sense if MS would in the future simply release a theme for Gnome, rather than waste resources on another OS that nobody wants.",1201948376

There is easy funding for real-estate, mining, farming, construction, dredging, highways and those new fangled finance schemes. But I doubt it. The VC's in Collins or Pitt St see Startups as too risky and do not understand them.",1201947366

Does the success bring the bloggers, or do the bloggers bring the success?",1201946802

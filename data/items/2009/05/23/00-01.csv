Even if someone sings Arc, or Clojure or Common Lisp or Scheme, praises, I am fine with it. But to say ""Languages X, Y, Z suck because they don't allow me to write succinct programs"", well, you're just trolling for X, Y and Z programmers to come out and straighten you out. The sort of macrology he is after (code-compacting type, not language extension) is pretty basic and could be done with the C pre-processor and M4. You can even write compact <i>assembly</i> programs with GASP, HLA, and NASM macros; it's not rocket science.<p>I reserve my judgment for Arc until it's done. There is no manual yet to hold the compiler accountable, and to save me from guess-work.

Obviously there are steps up from the Arduino in terms of power. Just like there were ""real"" Unix-caliber mainframe systems available in 1975 when the Altair launched. and likewise, the Arduino-compatible boards are getting more powerful every day, cf the new Arduino Mega as well as the Illuminato. The core of my argument is of the ""there's always room at the bottom"" type.

622958,comment,622858,622858,0,0,mad44,,,"Years ago, when I was a phd student, I had been to the psychologist at the university health center because I was unable to concentrate on anything. I had filled the ADHD diagnosis survey they gave me beforehand, and I was convinced I had ADHD. The psychologist discarded the survey and focused on a personal problem I had that time (my dad has been in a very bad accident). She told me there is nothing wrong with me, except that I was having a bad time. Her evidence was that I had a brilliant academic record (best student researcher, my GPA was not that good though). After all, when I am really interested in something I could concentrate very intensely for a couple of hours on that thing. She asked me if I would like to have some help with time management and organization techniques. I told her that I had read so many books on that, that I could give a seminar on it myself.<p>I was actually very relieved with her diagnosis, because, well, it sounded good, and I dislike the idea of medicating myself. But my problems came back frequently to haunt me. There have been numerous days when I couldn't get myself to do a simple task such as paying bills (just the physical act of writing checks and mailing). It sounds weird, but when I have many things to do, my brain shuts off and reacts by refusing to do anything at all. I know about getting things done and every conceivable productivity technique, but I never can get myself to put these in practice. I am very disorganized, and this costs me a lot. I am doing considerably good in my academic career, but doing awful in taking care of trivia.<p>I always took pride in doing OK without having to take any medication, but I guess I could do much better with medication. It hurts sometimes to endure these symptoms, but I have been able to carry on so far, so good.

The people who experience the short-term pain may themselves benefit from this new technology being adopted.<p>I get the sense a part of this is due to the sentiment that I've noticed that employers owe continuing retention to their employees. It is why layoffs carry such a social stigma. It created this sense the people should not <i>have</i> to retrain, and that they should not <i>have</i> to relocate. At the extreme, they shouldn't even <i>have</i> to change employers to do the same task. It would suck for me to have to do the same.

For him, in Arc, [compelling language features] do alleviate [library pain], so he is happy to use Arc. This logic is fine even if the [library pain] in Arc is actually worse than the [library pain] he experienced in Lisp, because [compelling language features] differs too.<p>So, no hypocrisy. You could still argue that he should have experienced less library pain in Lisp than he did experience, or that Lisp might have compelling features that he overlooked, or even that library pain cannot in principle be alleviated by language features, though I won't comment there.",1243037096

I escaped a complete tear-down of the motor only through an operation that involved the use of a stethoscope, another pair of trusted hands and the sort of concentration we associate with a bomb squad. When finally I laid my fingers on that feeler gauge, I felt as if I had cheated death. I don’t remember ever feeling so alive as in the hours that followed.""<p>Was I the only who smiled when they read this?",1243036959

As someone who went from zero embedded device hacking to some fluency because of Arduino, the Beagle Board seems exciting because it has the chance of opening up that related space to me as well.",1243036839

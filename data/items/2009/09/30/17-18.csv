853144,comment,852198,852418,0,0,AndrewO,,,"> you can store the HTML, JS and the data all in CouchDB<p>I think you're talking of CouchApp, which allows you to create apps like that on top of CouchDB.  Of course, if that was the maximum of what one was trying to do, one could get similar functionality from an RDBMS, some simple routing rules, and a CGI script that served content straight from the DB.<p>I guess my point is that there's not really anything intrinsic to CouchDB that makes this possible: it's a pretty short and inviting conceptual leap from ""this DB does everything through an HTTP interface"" to ""I can run my entire application from this DB"".  My worry (and I'm not accusing the parent of this) is that that misses out on all of the other things that CouchDB offers (especially the ability to merge DBs that have been disconnected for long periods, which often gets lost behind the HTTP interface and MapReduce hand-waving).",1254332981

853139,comment,852993,852993,0,0,jlgosse,,,"Excellent post. As someone who is going to apply to YC this coming winter, this article contains some extremely valuable information.<p>What I get from it mostly though, is that getting accepted is less about the application, and more about getting out there and getting things done.<p>Essentially, I can see a number of common points between both wheels' post and pg's comment:<p>1. It's a great idea to have something started. Once you have something started, pitching your idea and refining your pitch will surely help you out when explaining what problem you're trying to solve.<p>2. Contributing to HN often will help build your reputation. Nothing can help grow your reputation online like writing does. I've been told time and time again that I am an excellent writer, and that people respect me for it. If you can write well, contribute to HN.<p>3. Sharing your product with other people on HN is a great way to get feedback. The more feedback you receive, the greater ability you have to improve your product and eventually succeed.<p>4. The new(er) feature that allows you to post a video of you and your co-founders may actually be invaluable to getting accepted into the program. I would agree with this in that it's hard to judge a person's qualities from their writing alone. A video will give you a deeper look at their personality, and maybe a glimpse of whether or not they could handle a program such as YC.<p>With point four in mind, I was wondering if anyone has any advice on a little problem I am having. The problem is derived from the fact that my single co-founder is currently in NYC for the next few months. What would be the best way to create a video for our application, if we are both in different countries?<p>Thanks,<p>jlgosse",1254332895

853013,comment,851315,852149,0,0,realitygrill,,,"Thanks for writing an alternate and reasonable perspective. I generally hold very poor opinions about schooling and sometimes forget that it can and does work for certain types of people.<p>As someone who dropped out of high school to go to college, and then subsequently dropped out of said college, I am struck by the early similarities. I am you but perhaps less disciplined - a lot of 'hyperbrain' characteristics.<p>I'd also finished up my high school requirements by sophomore year (including 4 APs), although trying to set up dual enrollment was like pulling teeth in my school district.<p>However, like mrshoe, I thought school damaged me educationally. To be straight I'd say school was what killed my motivation - something along the lines of that one Einstein quote - and allowed me to form maladaptive study habits which I have never successfully eradicated.<p>Even now I am still unsure of what kind of advice to give a smart but demotivated youngster. Usually default to:<p><i>If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard enough problems. And that's a big mistake.</i> -Frank Wilczek",1254330217

8566156,comment,8565011,8565971,0,0,WildUtah,,,"&quot;The problem with this is that it assumes either a monopolistic seller or explicit or implicit collusion between sellers. Because if the market has vigorous competition then engaging in price discrimination will only drive the customers being discriminated against to your competitors.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s why gp used a movie theater as an example. The movie market depends on state authorized monopoly in the form of copyright. The result is that price discrimination is more legitimate and more beneficial to producers and consumers than it would be in a competitive market.<p>Of course, copyright exists as a trade off. The benefits of promoting the arts are worth it even though monopoly is bad, as long as the system is administered reasonably and competition exists between different producers of copyrighted works and each has a monopoly only on his own product.<p>The economics of a complex trade off like that are not a guide to how other open markets should work.<p>And even well intentioned state monopolies can be run badly and become a disaster.

8566134,comment,8561231,8563297,0,0,aktau,,,"> In the first piece of code, which is apparently new to Neovim, there&#x27;s a bug waiting to happen: casting size_t pointers to int pointers will fail on big-endian platforms where sizeof(size_t) != sizeof(int), and in general, the number of casts sprinkled everywhere is indicative of sloppy coding.<p>At first I thought you were referring to casting `size_t` to `int` (and the converse) in general, but now I notice you were referring to pointers to `int` to pointers to `size_t`. You are right, of course, and we should be more careful about that. Nevertheless, this specific case will soon dissapear.<p>To answer the last part of your question:<p>> The whole area of code also seems to be poorly reimplementing iconv, which is actually supported in the code, but never enabled in Neovim for some reason, according to the footnote - why have two code paths to do the same thing?<p>I alluded to it in the article itself, and I may only guess as to what Bram&#x27;s goals where, but I reckon:<p>1) Speed, for an important conversion like latin-1 to UTF-8, Bram might&#x27;ve wanted some extra juice. This is not uncommon in the Vim codebase. Possibly, one can&#x27;t (or couldn&#x27;t when Vim was made) rely on iconv being well-engineered. Also note that Vim was made to run on some pretty bare bones systems. 
2) Compatibility: as it stands, (Neo)vim can work just fine without iconv and still do the most useful transforms. This is actually good because iconv is not available everywhere or buggy (switches for disabling it have been requested in vanilla Vim).<p>I haven&#x27;t grokked the other encoding sides of vim (file and output), but it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;ll discover some things that might preclude an iconv-only approach.",1415259774

It&#x27;s running nicely, and it has a spiffy card that allows me to plug a USB flash drive in, boot from an image file on it, and reenter the first real computing world I started with.<p>Prior to the Apple, I got to flirt with a TRS-80 Model 1 a neighbor owned.  Writing a few BASIC statements and actually having the machine respond was intoxicating for me.  Loved it, and I knew right there and then I would be doing things with and on computers.<p>The Apple //e machine represents a whole lot of that early discovery time we all are thinking about.  It was open, had a monitor, mini-assembler, reasonable BASIC, and, and, and...<p>I got bootstrapped onto computing and the magic of assembly language on that machine.  And there were others, but that one really was the first.  The friends I made, stuff we did, things we learned were like magic.  I miss it all.<p>So, I boot that machine every so often.  Really, I always just want to know if it still works.  Then, I decide I want to write, play, code, and I do.<p>When I write, I can do it on that excellent keyboard, with the machine and it&#x27;s memorable feel.  The whole thing takes me back in time, and I do remember.  And then I can get it back onto a modern machine with that same USB stick and wonder at such a gap, still being useful.<p>I was moved by the idea of keeping in touch with the little kid part.  Yes.  I have a great memory of my childhood, and can tell you many events, times, places, things, people.  To be honest, I draw on it an awful lot.

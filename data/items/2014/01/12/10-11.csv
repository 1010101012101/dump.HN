At which point too much density becomes a danger and what kind of danger?<p>I guess that there might be already some answers to these question. And in my opinion it IS important that we start talking about this. Because the only discussion that I hear until now is that many countries have not enough children (e.g. Japan, Russia, Germany, Italy - just to name few that I have seen in print media in Europe) which is seen as a danger. But talking about socially and psychologically positive solutions how to better distribute population density - nobody is speaking about this. I guess that one of the reasons is because we still think in national boundaries. But this is not the only one. I think the deeper reasons might be more on an instinctive level?

This quick and dirty trick has been in my .bashrc forever and I still use it:<p><pre><code>    function md(){\n        pwd > /tmp/md_tmp\n\n    function gomd(){\n        cd `cat /tmp/md_tmp`\n</code></pre>\nso `md` marks the current directory and `gomd`go to the marked directory. Unlike bash builtins like pushd and popd, it uses the file system to store the marked directory so you  can pop up a new terminal and just do gomd. (you can&#x27;t with pushd/popd since the bash processes of the old and the new terminal are not related)<p>Edit: I see that your script uses links, I&#x27;ll check this out.",1389521155

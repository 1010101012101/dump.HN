1335352,comment,1332948,1334159,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>To reiterate: I am not critiquing Norvig's article, I am critiquing your argument.</i><p>To reiterate: any time I post the Norvig article here on HN, it is because I see a popular press report on something that appears to be a scientific finding, without any affirmative showing that proper science was done to reach that finding. As a reader in the general public, it is not my job to do unpaid scientific research to refute purported scientific findings, but rather my friendly suggestion to my fellow readers that they check whether a claim is put forth on the basis of verifiable research conducted by proper protocols. I presume that if a press release were issued by your lab for reading by the general public, it would link to a peer-reviewed professional journal where the research either has been published or is about to be published. Any time a Hacker News thread brings up a research finding, and someone says, ""Here is the link to the published article,"" I upvote that, because we can all do with more experience here in reading more scientific journal articles about more subjects. (It's regrettable, by the way, that there are still so many journal articles behind paywalls. I currently have access to a JSTOR subscription; if I did not, I would have much less access to scientific literature online.)<p>It appears that you and I agree that scientific research should be conducted according to certain well established methods. You are certainly more learned than I in the specifics of statistics, as I have observed when lurking in other threads. But the thread in which you first caught my notice for decrying my frequent posting of the link to the Norvig article on reading research<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>caught my eye because I thought it reflected a rather odd misunderstanding of my reason for posting the link. I post not to dissuade readers from taking scientific findings seriously, but precisely the contrary, to persuade readers to distinguish genuine science from publicity-seeking by press release.<p>I think it is in your very first post on HN that you asked a question about corruption in certain unnamed places. I have lived in other countries, so it doesn't surprise me to find out that some government officials are more persuaded by bribes than by scientific research. More generally, even before I had lived overseas, I had studied enough history and enough psychology (besides the philosophy of science I mentioned above) to be aware that human beings respond to incentives to disregard truth for personal advantage. I am especially careful here on HN to encourage readers to check sources and facts before believing the latest purported scientific finding, because examples abound<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Voodoo-Science-Road-Foolishness-Fraud/dp/0195135156"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Voodoo-Science-Road-Foolishness-Fraud/...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Snake-Oil-Science-Complementary-Alternative/dp/0195383427/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Snake-Oil-Science-Complementary-Altern...</a><p>of persons who make false claims (sometimes because of sincere self-delusion, and other times for more despicable reasons) that purport to be scientific claims.<p>If a claim comes along that is warranted by careful research, the research findings should be published somewhere--every science researcher has plenty of incentive to publish--and it would be enough, after I post the link to Peter Norvig's article, for someone else to post ""Here's a link to the published study, for all of us to check."" I like to learn more about science. I like for everyone to learn more about GENUINE science.<p>P.S. If we search all up and down this now quite lengthy thread, no one has offered even a scintilla of evidence for the proposition ""a mere 40 percent of gifted children will complete an undergraduate degree."" I am sure, noting that even most of the anecdotes of academic failure during high school in this thread relate going on to undergraduate study, that that statement is factually incorrect for the United States for any time since the Baby Boom. I attended high school with several bright learners who were turned off by high school and had poor grades in high school and who in several cases dropped out of high school. But all of my bright high school friends, without any exception, and even though they were not from wealthy backgrounds, gained undergraduate degrees within a few years of leaving high school. The burden of proof is on the unnamed ""researcher"" who made the implausible claim.",1273514227

Then, iTunes and WMP both refused to play the file because the format didn't match the file extension.  This sort of error should just plain flat out not be possible.

Facebook has carved out a nice hub for itself, being the most visited site other than Google, but what all these startup visionaries may be failing at is <i>vastly underestimating</i> the usefulness of an open social graph.\nIf Facebook suddenly finds its social graph baby is appropriated by an ad hoc open network that dwarfs its users, then Facebook loses control of the graph.<p>How might this happen? Browsers sure have changed a lot in just the past 2 years. Local storage is here today already, but almost no sites are doing anything with it. Google Gears had so much potential, but was too ahead of its time to become a trend. \nWhat if your browser stored your entire social graph locally, and you could configure your own privacy settings to only share what you want with sites you visit? That eliminates Facebook from\nbeing the master hub of the social graph—they are just another federated end point. As Facebook becomes ""spammy"" more users will want to block Facebook, so they might be convinced to use a local social graph in the same way hundreds of thousands are using AdBlock and FlashBlock. We already know Facebook will kill links to GreaseMonkey scripts that do this.<p>Alot of mashups and wild Javascript ideas will have to be seen over the next 8 months or so, but I definitely think the Facebook ""diaspora"" movement will take off once it's dead easy for end-users to run their own social graph programs locally from their own browser. Just like a desktop app. Perhaps even that might be asking too much of end users, the average of whom cannot recognize the difference between their browser and the Internet. Hopefully Apple will start baking new identity features into the iPad, since you know they will nail it as far as being simple enough for everyone to use.<p>The Techrunch rumor mill does keep whispering about Apple putting Facebook Connect into iTunes, but it seems more likely that Apple would take them on. Facebook will wish they had their own browser to push back with.<p>It's probably going to be a great tragedy that Apple is so unstoppable now that they can just roll over any other tech company at-will.",1273512780

I think that you can automate color compliments with 2, 3, 4, or x colors by using ""vectors"" to compute the opposite hues... cutting the HSV model in halves for two colors, thirds for three, etc.<p>To get to the aesthetics, you'll have to use voting or surveys, and the reason is somewhat straightforward. Here are a few resons (not all):<p>The appeal of colors change over time with fashion and trends. In the US, mint green and canary yellow in the 1930s, white and cherry red in the 1940s, the list goes on for consumer goods and their colors. Think of vintage goods and their colors. Pantone produces color forecasts and tweaks their colors over time to reflect tastes.<p>Cultural differences. Color symbolism plays a large role - after all part of a designer's skill is selecting the right color for the specific context of an assignment. White for mourning in Asia != white for a wedding. One thought is that the region or location may be significant in the aesthetic judgment. If I remember correctly, the ArthurAnderson logo was orange because it was a color that could be used globally without negative meaning.<p>One last note, which comes from my training in a modernist driven school, is the form and the function of a design in black and while should be rock solid and work before adding color and the complexity... I think this was taught so that the novice students we were would learn the basics of typography, form, and balance before getting into colors.<p>As to the aesthetics: You can use the voting model like colorlovers (I hope that older votes are when tracking  current color trends), use A/B testing if you are a web designer, or fall back to a company like Pantone to help you find current trends. Someone like google might be able to tie click paths to color schemes ... in other words data mine to establish what is a trend.",1273511385

1335157,comment,1334414,1335050,0,0,mquander,,,"Well, I'm not sure that's fair.  In most dynamic languages, you can add type annotations and/or formal pre/post-conditions to selected pieces of code, usually for either compiler verification or optimization purposes; thus making a little piece of your code statically typed.  Would you say they should just ""go all the way to C#"" (or ML, or whatever you prefer?)  Of course not.<p>The C# situation with <i>dynamic</i> is analogous.  It's for people who like working in a static language, but want a particular piece of code dynamically typed because it happens to be very convenient for the task at hand.  Obviously, there are a fair number of such tasks; mostly  whenever you're dealing with a piece of structured but unpredictable data that lives outside your static bubble, like XML or external unmanaged libraries.<p>And var isn't really worth mentioning; it's just very simplistic type inference on declarations.  It's just (very good) syntax sugar and doesn't have any special semantic meaning at all.",1273511347

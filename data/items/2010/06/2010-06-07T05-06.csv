For what it's worth at no time would I have invested in Russia. Now, a decade ago, 50 years ago or 100 years ago.<p>It's not about meanness towards Russia. It's about understanding how things function, or don't function, in Russia and actively choosing not to be a part of it. Russia has vast resources both materially and in it's people. I would very much like to invest in Russia but not the Russia that exists today.<p>I'm not a fan of the ""foreign investment will help change Russia for the better"" theory. As we've seen so many times this past decade, change comes from within and can not be forced by outsiders.<p>I can go on about the insanity that is Russia but the article does a good job at that. The bottom line is that profits are not so hard to find that one should be looking towards Russia to find them. Not only is the risk far too great but voluntarily supporting the state of things in Russia is too high a price for me to pay.<p>See ""Drug dealers shouldn't make iPhone apps"" from yesterday, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1408445"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1408445</a>.",1275889807

The implementation is what matters.<p>You say you are basically ready to release it.  So do so.  Just focus on making your product as good as possible.<p>If you have less features than the other company, that's fine.  It seems you are launching with a smaller feature set than them, which is probably a good thing, as until you get users you won't know whether any of them are useful or not.",1275887456

  remember is such a good thing, why hasn't evolution
  given us photographic memories? The answer according to
  Boyer and Walsh's model is because we'd starve when the
  local supermarket went out of business.

Has to be the stupidest thing I can ever remember reading in a purportedly scientific article. If I have photographic memory why would I visit the supermarket more than once, after it closes? Just because I remember that there was food there doesn't mean I'm required to go there.",1275887441

This was a public trust, and I don't know how similar other states' implementation is, but if there are any companies that offer the financial management of such a program, it would make sense to invest in that.<p>I suppose if you were really serious about making that bet, you could form a company that offered a similar investment service.

Second, a user can enable geofencing or add a Bluetooth factor to prevent the device from authorizing outside specific geographical zones or when unconnected to specified Bluetooth devices (a FitBit, iBeacon, etc.).<p>While in theory an attacker could disable these services within the app, we&#x27;ve assigned 60 minute delays to creating or removing geo-fences and Bluetooth device factors. The idea being that you should realize your phone/device is gone within an hour, and within that time you can use our third protection: remotely unpair a device via the LaunchKey website or via another paired device, thus disabling that device.<p>Thanks for your feedback and please let us know if you have any other questions or comments!<p>(disclosure: I&#x27;m a co-founder of LaunchKey)",1387824473

On the list of things that could be used to prove a lack of corporate ownership of the courts, that falls very close to irrelevant. Just because damages for and against various entities of varying power, wealth, and importance, does not necessarily mean a lack of control. While a C level or two might get fired for something egregious enough, to the kinds of corporations we are talking about, a court damage is just another business cost and isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. You win some, you lose some...<p>Let&#x27;s not forget there are two court systems. The real key, is not in the civil courts, which I would agree with you are largely tipped in the favor of corporations over citizens (and sometimes in favor of more powerful corporations), but in the criminal courts. It is in the criminal courts where the real &quot;ownership&quot; of the court system comes into play.<p>To take a look at the numbers behind the private prison industry, especially as it it relates to non-rights violating crime, and say that it is easy to disprove that corporations own the judicial system, is naive and ill-informed at best. At the very least there is much more to be discussed before such powerful conclusion could be reached.<p>Let us take for example, that an FBI whistleblower contact of Sibel Edmonds who was part of the vetting of judicial candidates says that anytime he came back and said a candidate was clean, they were immediately dropped from the roster. The implication is that only dirty, and therefore more easily controlled, people would be allowed to take the position. Or major supreme court cases where clear conflicts of interests were present, and yet a member of SCOTUS would not recuse themselves, with almost no backlash. With the well known for decades tactics of blackmail of the NSA on judges and their 6 degrees of KBacon just coming to light to the public, the real kicker to keep in mind is that Snowden was working for a corporation, not directly for NSA itself, and yet still got access to all this information!<p>I would venture to say that any kind of in depth study of the judicial system would show that the rule of law itself is in tatters, and the corruption is expanding in every corner. Such is the path of a nation who has forgotten the reasons behind The Great Rising, but that is another discussion entirely.",1387824421

The problem with recursion is that the fact that a given recursion is O(n) is usually quite opaque, while for a loop it is obvious.  This is a much more significant concern than the fact that the change of state from one iteration to the next is implicit, rather than explicit.  However, you can avoid both recursion and mutable state by using map and reduce, e.g.<p><pre><code>  def fibonacci(n):\n    initial_state = (0, 1)\n    state_change = lambda s: (s[1], s[0] + s[1])\n    final_state = reduce(lambda s, _: state_change(s), xrange(n), initial_state)\n    return final_state[0]\n</code></pre>\nThe problem arises because even though recursion is relied on heavily in the foundations of mathematics, mathematicians also like to use the weakest axiom system they can in a given situation.  Therefore they use set theory when they really have to, and first order arithmetic (which includes recursion) most of the time.  But computer programming does not usually even need recursion, and so we shouldn&#x27;t use it except when we have to.<p>EDIT: seeing the O(log(n)) solutions, I started to wonder if there is a way to see this without knowing about numbers of the form a + b * sqrt(5).  There is, and you can also see it clearly from my solution.<p>By observing that the way I use reduce is just applying a function n times, you only need to see that the function is a linear transformation on R^2, to see that the problem is just calculating a matrix power.  It is trivial to construct the matrix power in log(n) using the usual tricks.",1387822328

He is not a good guy, he is not noble.  He is a risk-taker who tried exploiting loopholes between the law and technology.  For every action there is a reaction.<p>His action was to use unfairness in the law to exploit it for his own financial gain.  What the big companies did was use their unfair advantage with politics to pull some strings and do things that are arguably legal or illegal?  What is the one takeaway?  The laws are unfair.  What Kim Dotcom did should not be legal, and there should be effective tools to have him comply or actually give a shit about the piracy on his websites, without &quot;stifling innovation&quot; around the rest of the internet for actual legitimate services that aren&#x27;t built on piracy.",1387821727

One of my techniques for learning has been by going on interviews and flopping, then going back and learning all the interview question material on my own time. Wash and repeat.I&#x27;ve been doing this bullshit since the first day I started teaching myself. It all began with an interview that required knowledge of strictly HTML & CSS. Suffice to say after I tried to mimic an unordered list with 12 div blocks I didn&#x27;t get the gig. Things are better now. I promise! Where am I? Whats this padded wall doing here? !!!!",1387821666

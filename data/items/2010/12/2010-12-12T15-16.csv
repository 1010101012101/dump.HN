1997247,comment,1997040,1997182,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I've had this go both ways before, too. I think the point to take away from this sort of experience is that the best you can do is apply your best judgment and re-evaluate as you go along. Often opaque documentation makes sense after you gain some context by reading the source; it works the other way, too. With experience, you gain a sense for what path to go down; sometimes that (subconscious) heuristic is totally wrong, which is why it's important to consciously re-evaluate on top of that. The current approach isn't making you any practical headway, even though you're learning a lot about the system in question? Take a step back and try looking at the bigger picture; what are you <i>really</i> missing? If you can, sleep on it for a bit.<p>Most of all, if you're getting it right more than 50% of the time (and I'm finding it hard to imagine a way you'd do worse than that) there really is no point beating yourself up about it.",1292169391
1997246,comment,1994529,1996189,0,0,merijnv,,,"Well, I didn't mean an actual MapReduce cluster, that's just silly. I was just pointing out that Haskell compilers can convert trivially convert these sorts of things to multicore code. Parallel Haskell basically does this, converting normal code to easy multicore code.<p>My point wasn't about using Haskell for high performance computing, my point was that Haskell's compiler can convert normal Haskell code to multicore code without (much, if any) work from the programmer. There is a large gap in between sequential single threaded program and a full MapReduce cluster and I think there is a significant amount of software written in this gap where Haskell-like languages could help with the parallelism/concurrency. The only reason I referenced MapReduce is since its a well known example even for people who are not well versed in functional programming (its a very common concept in functional programming).",1292169379

1997204,comment,1996161,1997160,0,0,gjenkin,,,"While I personally would prefer to follow the ""good design is as little design as possible"" mantra, it's not a principle that should be followed in all cases.  Dieter Rams is speaking from a modernist school of design philosophy, and while many companies/brands are adherents to this school, not all are.<p>For example, from a graphic design or typographic design perspective, designers like David Carson (<a href=""http://www.davidcarsondesign.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidcarsondesign.com/</a>) have demonstrated the power of postmodernist approaches for certain brands.  If brands like ESPN or Wired adopted the ""as little as possible"" approach to graphic design, your experience with those brands would be much different to your experience today.  Wired magazine would be black on white with symmetrically placed photos and no visual decoration.  That's as little design as possible.  For some people, this might be an improvement to Wired, but the problem is that if they delivered a magazine like that, you would have no idea that it was in fact Wired.  You would forget the brand and possibly never buy their magazine again.<p>So this principle - and just about every other principle Dieter Rams lists as good design - is very specific to the brand he was working with when these principles were developed: Braun.  That's not to say that these principles are not excellent.  They are.  But they are specific to their context.  And the design principles that you develop for your product or brand should be specific to your context.",1292167977

1997182,comment,1997040,1997040,0,0,maayank,,,"This is a general programming issue, not a system programming issue. Not so long ago at work, I had to implement a regex search over a Lucene document store. Now, the thing is that we used the latest version (at the time) of Lucene, 3.0. All the examples I found online and most of the documentation referred to version 2. Naturally they didn't mentioned they were using version 2, I just had to scratch my head a few times while I tried to realize why the regex API depicted there is not only different, but not even merely existing. Turns out one of the design goals of Lucene 3 was to separate stuff from the core Lucene to external libraries. So, after finally searching through their SVN I found the source files for the regex libraries. I ran into some problems with the way Lucene parses regex queries and relates it to terms and again, as in the article, after hours and hours of searching through documentation I resorted to just reading through Lucene's code, which indeed turned to be fruitful for less the time I invested in finding and reading documentation...<p>I really was not sure what to learn from that episode. The logical conclusion seems to be to try to read your way through the target source code, if you have it, before investing the time to find and skim through documentation. On the other hand, it feels like a really bad lesson.
Time will tell if this moral holds up.",1292166785

They wanted to generate buzz by promoting in various online communities as a ""community member."" Not surprisingly, this is where they had their most success. I fortunately didn't have to participate in the buzz generation but there's no question everyone is looking to do this kind of marketing, whether you like it or not. Marketers will do anything to get eyeballs on their message.",1195965067

A cookie could be placed for readers who only want to read such versions. This might mean that there's one-more-damn-thing to constantly administer, but it would keep cross dressing pictures off the GWB page. (Oh, wait, that really happened...)",1195964840

It's probably called 'critical thinking' in the educational circles.<p>A lot of students no longer use the index, or table of contents. Or at least <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/</a> if they don't have access to the LexisNexis, or something similar. Or maybe they are just going through the motion, practicing being a mindless drone.<p>But that just points out the failing of the teachers, not the students. Warren Buffett has an interesting perspective on this: <a href=""http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/clubs/investment/WarrenBuffett.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/clubs/investment/WarrenB...</a><p>-----<p>Q: What is your view on education?<p>A: Bill Gates thinks we're [America] falling behind. [Mr. Buffett speaks with Bill Gates frequently]. I had a great advantage when I went to public school compared with kids today. When I was in school there were very few career opportunities for women, so an enormous number of very talented women became teachers, and I benefited from their instruction. Today there are many more career opportunities, and as a result the pool of potential teachers has shrunk.<p>-----",1195964727

In any case, I think single-exit is fine for a corporation that needs to use clearly-defined, easy-to-follow policies.  It's a reasonable baseline.<p>However, there are cases where trying to workaround multiple exits does lead to more errors.  A function that returns 'right' 'left' or 'both' is probably better off having 3 returns rather than assigning the result to a local variable and carrying it to the end of the function.  You might declare the local as the wrong type, you might forget an 'else' and accidentally overwrite the return value, etc.  ""No early exits unless your function has no side-effects"" is a lot less clear to most programmers.<p>Of those 495 bugs on the bug list, how many were caused by broken side-effects?

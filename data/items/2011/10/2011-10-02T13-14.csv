We have a lot of older users who are not especially computer-literate, so an interface that doesn't change is valuable to us.<p>The machines are also fairly ageing, and don't support the composited desktop. I did test Ubuntu 11.10 beta on one, but it was so slow (with what I assume was Unity 2D) that it would be unusable for day-to-day work. All we use at work are Chrome, Thunderbird, OpenOffice and Audacity - why would we need Unity? Why can't we turn it off?<p>For me, Ubuntu definitely peaked at 10.04 and I'm going to be looking elsewhere in the near future.",1317563874

The 20% probability of getting $2.5M does not translate to 100% probability of getting 20% of that amount, i.e. $500k.<p>He wrote: ""Let's see how you, the founder, should make out if successful."" This means that the whole scenario depends on the plan succeeding, so his calculating the risk-adjusted return is incorrect. If successful, the founder will get $2.5M; if not, he'll get anything from 0 to that amount. Also, there is a non-zero chance that the company will be worth $100M after three years; shouldn't that be included too?",1317563728

Here's my most commonly used applications, all of which I recommend:<p>* Smart Keyboard Pro: <a href=""https://market.android.com/details?id=net.cdeguet.smartkeyboardpro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/details?id=net.cdeguet.smartkeybo...</a> -- Allows me to use a Dvorak keyboard on the phone, but even if you don't use Dvorak it's still a great purchase. It has a lot of options to make your typing more efficient that the stock keyboard doesn't have.<p>* The Kindle app to read books. Now I mostly use it to read <i>.mobi files I've downloaded instead of buying things at the Amazon store, for which it works brilliantly. I wish it allowed copy/pasting of text though.<p></i> Google Reader for RSS/Atom<p>* GMail application for GMail.<p>* The stock Mail application for work IMAP, although I'll test out K-9 mentioned in this thread<p>* ColorNote for taking notes / shopping lists.<p>* live logcat for the novelty of having a l33t boot sequence (and getting rid of that annoying Samsung boot-up sound): <a href=""https://market.android.com/details?id=eu.chainfire.livelogcat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://market.android.com/details?id=eu.chainfire.livelogca...</a><p>* Root Explorer to manage root-only files.<p>* Skype to make video calls<p>* ConnectBot to ssh from the phone, although I haven't found out how to enable landscape mode in it, which is annoying.<p>* Listen for podcasts, although I haven't found out how to make it auto-download say the last 3 podcasts of everything I subscribe to.<p>* BBC News and Al Jazeera video for some world news<p>* Gh4a to browse GitHub<p>* AdFree to block spam<p>* Screenshot to take screenshots<p>* WolframAlpha for any sort of conversion / math queries.<p>* A PushUp / SitUp / Squats app (all separate apps) for managed stationary exercise. Although I'd like to find something that I could turn on and would give me instructions for a general N-minute workout that could be done at home.<p>Things I wish I didn't have to use, or don't know how to do, but haven't found out how to replace / do:<p>* The default Samsung camera application. There's no way to turn off the shutter noise on it, and it'll plain refuse to take pictures if the battery is low.<p>* The default task switcher, which often doesn't list the application I've just switched from (even though it's still open)<p>* The default system clipboard which doesn't seem to have a history / search feature like Emacs's kill ring.<p>* Having the default Samsung apps installed on the phone. I tried to use Titanium Backup PRO but it didn't work for removing or freezing them.<p>* Having something like Gesture search which searches across the entire phone but doesn't require me to draw on the screen, I just want to type a query.<p>* Sometimes the phone will go into some sort of voice command mode. I haven't found out how to disable it.<p>Lastly I plan to write an application that hooks into the ""Share"" handler for text/plain content and extracts the content of the clipboard, scans it for a URL, and pastes <i>that</i> to the clipboard.<p>I've found that quite a few apps have a ""Share"" functionality, but no ""copy the URL of what I'm looking at to the clipboard"", and I haven't found any existing app that works around this.",1317563609

3062831,comment,3062472,3062750,2,0,apaprocki,,,"> operating system implementation of POSIX, or dynamic library loading, all the subtle things with different binaries formats, and so forth.<p>That is the real pain point. I embed Spidermonkey on not just Linux, but also Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX. While they are all ""POSIX"", they all have their peculiar issues which make it harder to dev with or write OSS. Autoconf, while hardly the best option, usually allows enough tweaking to get by in these strange worlds. Solaris is usually the nicest of the pack, while AIX is usually the odd ball. Submitting patches to OSS is easy enough to support these systems most of the time, but the annoying part is that things usually regress again quickly and so you're left constantly bug-fixing when things should ""just work"". Part of the mess could be avoided if vendors all rallied around GCC/Clang/gdb and redirected their compiler efforts to optimizing open compilers for their hardware. Maybe POSIX needs to evolve faster -- if you view an autoconf test for something as an inconsistency that POSIX could standardize away.<p>EDIT: Here's a perfect example of something which should be ""easy"" and standard in POSIX.

You might think that VC's make tons of money, but when you consider that the $2.4 Million has to fund their entire business, and when you look at how the costs break down, it starts to look a bit more reasonable.<p>Here's how those costs break down:<p>Office space on Sand Hill Road: 
5000 sq ft @ $60sq ft / year = $300,000
3 exec admins @ $ $80k / year = $240,000
2 Associates @ $150k / year = $300,000
2 Analysts @ $100k / year = $200k
4 partners @ $300k / year = $1.2M
Marketing / sponsoring events @ $100k / year
Legal fees @ $300k / year<p>Now, when you exclaim that a $300k salary is exorbitant, consider that most engineering managers in Silicon Valley make about that much.  $300k will allow you to purchase a house in San Jose  ($500k for an average house in the burbs), but it won't let you purchase anything in Palo Alto (over $1M, easy.  Monthly payments are around $7k).<p>Nurses working the night shift in Silicon Valley make around $150k a year without working tons of overtime.  Firemen and policemen make about the same.  An ER tech at a hospital makes about $70k.<p>Add to that, that most partners and associates at VC firms will end up working 80 to 100 hours a week.  So, partners will end up having an hourly wage of about $75 an hour, which is what PHP contractor will make in the area.  A decent Rails contractor will bill about $150.<p>So, when you break it down, the greedy blood sucking vampire VC's...  really don't make as much as it's made out to be.  A number of them are actually pretty nice, and great people to have a beer with.  And, it's actually a pretty hard job.<p>Full Disclosure:  I haven't made a penny from VC's.  I've had a couple sponsor events for Hackers & Founders, and a number of them have been really helpful in teaching me the ropes of Silicon Valley.",1317561707

Obviously.<p>Suppose now someone comes along to invest, and they put in $3M to the company.  What percentage equity should you each now hold?<p>Simplistically, your holding should still be worth $1M, and their holding should be worth $3M.  The company is now worth $4M, comprised of the $1M it was worth to begin with, plus another $3M in cash (or promises or whatever).  You should have $1M of that, so now you own 25% of the company.  The investor should have $3M of value, so they own 75% of that $4M total.<p>So on the surface, neither of you have gained.  Except now the company has a shed-load of money, and so it can invest and trade more aggressively, thereby increasing its value.  As a result, the company increases in value, and your 25% holding goes up in value.<p>Pretty much all trades and investments can be assessed like this, but with some refinements, in particular, factoring in the expectation of success.<p>Consider pitching for an investment.  You value the company at $1M, you want $500K, so after the investment the company will be worth $1.5M and you will own 67% of that.  Based on that assessment, you should be offering 33% equity for that $500K.  But the investor will disagree with your assessment, saying that the company is now, currently, before investment, as not worth $1M.  Perhaps they will say that without investment your company is only worth $500K.  As a result, post-investment your company is worth $1M and you should each get half the equity.  The gain for you both is that now, with the cash (and possibly expertise) of the investor, perhaps the company really is now worth $1.5M, so your 50% is now worth $750K, and the investor has immediately gained $250K (on paper).<p>The mis-match in the assessments of an owner and a potential investor is an area of considerable research and discussion, sometimes heated, but the above (very simplistic) analysis is a useful starting point.  It largely matches the analysis he gives about selling to a competitor at $500K versus taking investment at $500K hoping to grow the company to $5M (giving him 50% of that, with a 20% chance of succeeding, making it worth an expected $500K)",1317561539

In any case here is how I see it, not that I'm right.<p>Shareholders of international companies are better off if the company doesn't pay the tax penalties from repatriation.  Those shareholders will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, if nothing else. But the question is why would a company bring money back from China (for example) only to pay taxes on it before sending it back to China to pay for the next round of manufacturing?  Also, international companies almost always are required to pay taxes on the profits in the country it was earned.  There are games you can play to show the profit in your home country, but those are unethical.  To understand why think about it from the point of view of each country a company operates.<p>When accounting decisions do come down to questions that could go either way, profit is shown on the books in the country that would incur the least tax expense.  Its exactly what most individuals do.  For example I love the big city I live near.  However, I chose to live outside of city because a don't want to pay for the city government services when the little town I chose live in has similar services and lower tax rates.  I pay for the city services I use through the city sales tax, but they are crazy if they think I'll start paying city property taxes on a house that I already pay property taxes on to another town.  If I did own both a city home and a home in the smaller town,  there is no way I would be OK with the city bring to tax me on both.  Similarly Apple pays taxes on its US operations to the US but why should it pay the US taxes on foreign earned profits that it already pays foreign taxes on?<p>I have a hard time faulting a company for not paying anymore than the rules require.  Unless every company can agree on how much extra they should pay above the minimum, a company not minimizing their tax burden is at a financial disadvantage and will lose marketshare and eventually be marginalized.  The only way I know that you can obtain an agreement to the amount of taxes that should be paid is by changing the tax law.  Want more capital brought back into the US economy?  Lower the taxes below those of the countries the US is competing with for that capital.  Want US companies to pay more taxes?  Raise the base tax rate, and close loop holes.  While I'm thinking of it...  Loop holes are almost never what we think they are.  The vast majority are not some shady accounting trick dreamed up in a darkly lit room by a weaselly accountant or tax lawyer.  They are discounts on the tax rate voted on by congress, usually intended to produce some good like creating jobs.<p>Really though, if you think about it...  It only makes sense to make it easy on companies to move money into the US.  If a company wants its cash back in the US, there are only three thing I can think of it would do with it.  1. Put it in the banking system, which grows the economy and increases taxes.  2. Spend it, which grows the economy and increases taxes  3. Give it back to investors, who pay taxes on it and then do one of the other two things.",1317561481

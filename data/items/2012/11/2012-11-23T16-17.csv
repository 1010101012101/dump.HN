You're either using the wrong language (eg. C for a GUI product), or you're reimplementing wheels when you should be using a library, or you're not able to inspire others to join the project and help out on some details.<p>Or, very very rarely, what you're doing is ground-breaking and highly skilled.

When you have to wait 15 min and have a good chance your computer will crash during the ordeal so you'll have to wait another 15 min you'll feel it has more value for your money for some reason. You would play games which suck for weeks/months because they take effort to load and get going. Not sure if that's different now with Linux; when you cannot get something going because you have to build it and ./configure; make; make install has errors; if, after a week of messing around, you get it going, you'll bloody play/use it, no matter what it turns out to be.",1353689598

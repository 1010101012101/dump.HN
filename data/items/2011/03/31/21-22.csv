My SPARC 5 workstation had a small local disk, which had crucial things like vi on it, which were fast to access.  It might have been 500 megabytes or less. /usr was NFS-mounted over an unswitched 10-megabit Ethernet to a gigantic 35-gigabyte NFS server, from which I had access to a huge variety of software, including something like 8 versions of the CenterLine C++ compiler, much more than would fit on my local machine, but which was much slower to access.  My home directory was also NFS-mounted.<p>Installing the huge variety of software on everybody's workstation would have meant that we had to have dozens of copies of it, using up precious disk space, and furthermore that installing or updating software would need to be done on every single workstation, instead of just on the NFS server.  rdist existed but wasn't widely used; rsync had just been invented.<p>Also, ""packages and versions""? pkg_add isn't what you think of as a package management system.

See e.g the Civic Type-R 2008 review which is a complete joke when the Stig review is the direct opposite. Either a car is a lemon or a gem but it can't be both. Whether Clarkson is genuine or stages such opinionated behavior remains unclear and part of the myth.

Deciding that the best defense was a good offense, he launched this absurd suit against the person who brought his loose talk to light. I feel like he'd have been reporting it to his local bar, and asking the accounting company he disparaged if they would settle or accept arbitration.<p>I wonder if he will face disciplinary sanctions on top of his courtroom humiliation?

(I dropped out of professional mathematics, but since I'm now working in Functional Programming I did not stray too far.)<p>What I want to say is, that the process of doing mathematics is solving and understanding problems.  And since we are rarely interested in concrete solutions to concrete problems, we build up theories and algorithms to solve whole classes of problems.  Building up those theories is a highly creative process, but ultimately, a problem can only be seen as `solved' if we find a mechanical process for eliminating the need for creativity.<p>Let me give you an example: There are lots of interesting questions you can ask about linear recurrence sequences (e.g. the Fibonacci sequence), like what happens if we add to sequences?  Or when we interleave them?  Or when we only pick every n-th element.  Or when we want to find out the i-th, without having to calculate every element that comes before.<p>Solving those kinds of problems requires lots of thinking.<p>But if you apply even more thinking, you can come up with generating functions.  They are a tool that will enable you to solve all those problems really easily.  (And enable you to spare your creativity for much harder problems.  That's progress!)",1301605468

Still figuring the HN interface out and didn't see your reply to me!)<p>I'm very much talking about tendancies here rather than absolutes. Certainly some very principled sites manage to keep their editorial courage - in the gaming community, for example, Zero Punctuation and Penny Arcade both run ads, and neither are afraid of pissing people off.<p>But it's a dichotomy I've always found uncomfortable and difficult to reconcile with when running sites myself, and I think a lot of people have the same problem - you're to be applauded for managing to steer a straight path, and I'm sure you've had to fight to do it.<p>(Indeed, you could view the entire content farming industry as a manifestation of the same problem - when your client isn't the person coming to your site for content, it's very easy to let the content slide.).<p>And even in your company, at the end of the day, if there's a strategic meeting about how to increase revenue (assuming you need to), the questions you'll be asking will tend toward discussing the advertisers' needs, not the readers' (except in as much as you'll be asking how you can increase views, of course). I know this is an impossible question to answer, but in similar situations I've always ended up wondering ""How much better would our services have ended up if any revenue-focussed meeting centered on our users/readers rather than our advertisers?""<p>Incidentally, I'd strongly disagree that advertising is a dead model. And I agree that particularly in the gaming sector, it's possible to give users genuine value with some ads - my partner runs a gaming site and she's experimenting with the same model, with the same intention of giving users ads for things of value to them.",1301605235

We can dump money into Africa at far greater levels than they can sustainably support.",1301605228

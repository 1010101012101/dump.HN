Especially the part about making the &quot;adding an entry&quot; part easier, it didn&#x27;t dawn on me that some of that information is redundant.<p>The reason I&#x27;ve been writing driving directions in a wall of text is because in a lot of cases, google doesn&#x27;t map all of the forest roads required to get to the trailhead. There are some hikes, like <a href=""http://hike.io/hikes/mount-rose"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hike.io/hikes/mount-rose</a>, which do and in that case I include the link in the Directions header.

7088820,comment,7087537,7088699,1,0,lambdaphage,,,"Well, that really depends on what you consider a price: if a law prevents a landlord from renting to the tenant offering them the most money, they have to decide on the basis of some other criterion. In SF, you apparently had people showing up to open houses offering to pay the (legally stipulated) rent a year in advance.  (<a href=""http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n03/rebecca-solnit/diary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n03/rebecca-solnit/diary</a> NB: the author is apparently sympathetic to rent control)  Moving a year&#x27;s worth of future rent up to the present costs money in the form of interest rates, and is a cost.  Landlords in rent-controlled units are notorious for dragging their feet on repairs, since the tenant is unlikely to look elsewhere and even if so, another occupant will always be ready to take over the lease.  Just searching for a place in a rent-controlled district takes more time.  All of these are costs, arising from the fundamental fact that if you make it illegal to allocate a resource on the basis of price, you still have to allocate it <i>some other way</i>.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t be worried about rent control failing to function as a price ceiling-- you should be worried about it functioning <i>exactly</i> as a price ceiling.",1390215355

7088807,comment,7088042,7088042,9,0,netcan,,,"Since this became such a public debate issue in Europe, I&#x27;ve actually more or less landed on the idea that maybe corporate taxes (taxing profits) are a lost battle. The only way to really combat it is for different countries to collude and perhaps sanction tax havens. Even then, I doubt they will be able to raise much tax.<p>Modern tax systems are diverse by design: sales tax/VAT. Excise/sin taxes, income taxes, CGT, employer taxes, etc. The mix is designed to reduce volatility. It&#x27;s also designed to max out tax revenue while avoid damaging the economy by discouraging things like labour, savings, or other important activities too much. The effective maximum revenue for a country to collect in taxes appears to be somewhere in the 35%-45%  of GDP range. After that diminishing returns on taxes kick in. Most euro countries are taxing (or rather spending) near that max. So, they can&#x27;t afford to let corporate taxes.<p>Problem is that corporate tax is unavoidably problematic. Large multinationals can arrange their activities (not just their paperwork) depending on taxes. I doubt an single country want to create a tax the ensures large companies avoid setting up local subsidiaries within their borders. The end result is a different set of rules for the large and/or sophisticated that is more lenient than the rules on small companies.<p>Personally, I would rather see corporate tax abolished than see it applied in such a way that it discriminates against small companies.",1390215056

Basically the strongest evidence out there are observational population studies (not controlled) that found there is a slight correlation between marijuana use and eventual development of psychosis.<p>The obvious problem is that correlation != causation.

If you abolish corporate income taxes, then I could have my company loan you the $1000 and receive the interest; it would then compound at 5% per year, and I would only pay income tax when the money is paid out to me as a dividend.  In effect, you would be turning corporations into tax shelters.<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t absolutely insurmountable; in fact, Canada already has different tax rates for &quot;active business income&quot; vs. investment income, and theoretically you could have a 0% rate on &quot;active business income&quot; and a 40% corporate tax rate on investment income (which would then create non-taxable dividends when finally paid out to individuals).

This is why I could remark what I did - because I&#x27;ve actively looked into explanations of the difference, several times, over the last year or so, and walked away with the same conclusions every time.<p>My point is that the more I try to understand other people&#x27;s explanation, the more I think it&#x27;s just semantics. To put it in your terminology as used in your post, it seems that you are redefining what is commonly and in a broad sense known as &#x27;classes&#x27; as &#x27;metaobjects&#x27; as a generalization of different ways to implement classes. Which is fine, when you look at the details, but to me the difference doesn&#x27;t warrant overloading a well-known term like &#x27;class&#x27;. (Although I&#x27;m still not clear what you&#x27;d call a C++ class, if it&#x27;s not a meta-object as your reply suggests.)<p>To stay with your C/Pascal vs Smalltalk example - I&#x27;d be perfectly fine calling a C struct a &#x27;class&#x27; when doing object-oriented C, for example as done in GObject (from GLib, one of the Gnome base libraries), and calling a Smalltalk class also &#x27;class&#x27;. &#x27;class&#x27; is a malleable OO concept, and its exact implementation isn&#x27;t all that important or interesting conceptually, and is certainly not tied to one specific implementation of the concept. I still don&#x27;t see how the Javascript &#x27;implementation&#x27; (I put this in quotes because most things in Javascript are just accidents derived from design decisions that put a high premium on ease of implementation, which BTW is usually how I like it, I&#x27;m not knocking on JS for that here) of classes is so different that it warrants its own name (&#x27;prototype&#x27;), suggesting it&#x27;s completely different from &#x27;classes&#x27; (and not only that suggestion, but also people claiming that they&#x27;re &#x27;very&#x27; or &#x27;fundamentally&#x27; different - not saying your claim is that strong, I can&#x27;t really tell from the post, just that some people do).",1390213971

If low female population in the tech sector is due to the lack of resource and the stereotyped masculine geek image, then how does inviting girls to an all-girl programming class help them in the long run?<p>If we want to minimize stereotype, and if the stereotype has to do with gender, then we need to educate both genders. This means bring in female speakers to educate and show to both  the boys and the girls what they do as software engineer or as a mechanical engineer. The same resource we offer to girls can be offered to boys.<p>Because the popular culture has associated geek with a masculine image, a lot of girls don&#x27;t think they are capable of or should be involved. Is mixed gender event less powerful than single-gender event? To some extent yes. For the beginning, the girls may feel comfortable with their own gender. But later on? First time working with a guy on a hackathon project? I am not shy, but if you ask me to work with a female for the first time, I probably end up being shy and careful.<p><i>but you don&#x27;t want to put any effort into thinking or learning about gender</i><p>What do I need to know about gender? What is special there that I am not aware of?<p>In reality, people think differently about themselves. Some people think they are more capable than others. The best we can hope is that we can give each other a chance to show what they can do, to bust the myth that guys are better.",1390212569

In this way, we get cheaper electricity at night which is used for storage heaters and immersion water heater. However, we no longer have the storage heaters, so it doesn&#x27;t really make sense.

Lots of things are required to be RCD protected in the UK, so as you say, it makes sense just to put everything behind an RCD. We don&#x27;t get any nuisance trips, which I attribute to a generally higher standard of wiring, earthing etc. in the UK, although that could just be jingoism :) (I did once live in the US and some of the literally fraying wiring connected to two pin sockets with no earthing in the house I lived in scared me.)",1390212479

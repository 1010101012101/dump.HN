He's just started to think about long-term career/college interests and he's interested in computer science. I know that in my freshman year ""Intro to Programming"" course in college a few years ago, most of the real CS majors already knew how to program. I also know from perusing this site that you can get started early and be very successful.<p>My questions is: How do I encourage him to teach himself programming now, and hopefully by extension give him the tools to succeed in life (and probably do better than me)? I gave him my old Java textbook which is introductory and starts out with parts of the computer and all that jazz. I know there are a lot of web resources, but I think a few great books would do the trick. (Christmas is coming up.)",1290103101
1918635,comment,1917938,1918520,0,0,mkilling,,,"Penumbra itself was awesome (your examples are proof for that), it's just that I didn't really enjoy writing the game logic itself. My approach was basically manipulating huge hashmaps each frame. When I started out that was really manageable but I ended up with one monolithic hashmap for my game state (storing other huge hashmaps for the game objects) that was just not fun to work with anymore.
I'm by no means an experienced Clojure programmer, so maybe I did miss something. Maybe I'm also too deeply rooted in object-oriented programming to fully embrace FP for architecting a game - my  high-level architecture was very similar to what I would have created in an object-oriented language (methods, polymorphy, ...).
Anyways (as I said in a comment above) I really enjoy having functional tools at hand, but at least for game dev my favorite paradigm is still OOP.
Maybe you can give me any pointers about writing more advanced games in Clojure?",1290103093

<a href=""http://prog21.dadgum.com/37.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prog21.dadgum.com/37.html</a><p>2. The author is constrained by the Erlang feature set.  The author rejects out of hand the idea of using ""structs"", but Clojure's maps and records are easy to use, share data and would perform admirably.<p>3. The author is constrained by his retrogame and microsystem domain.  No modern gaming platform has issues with game state using too much memory or generating too much garbage (exception: complex physics).  In fact, data duplication is now a common game performance technique.  But if your tastes run toward ultralean programming, this is a distasteful state of affairs.<p>4. Much of modern game development has moved to an increasingly functional dataflow model already because of the necessities of multiprocessing and network gaming.  It's rarely elegant and never done in a functional language, but it's the current reality.<p>5. Games are one of the places where a sophisticated view of time, as Rich Hickey advocates in his fantastic JVM Languages Summit keynote, offers a lot of value.  It's a problem that thoughtful programmers and designers in the game industry have often considered, but have been unable to innovate much in the current technological regime.

Sites with a high concentration of audience for higher demand verticals can see higher CPMs, particularly if you've got decent volume of preferred placement sizes and get Google Display rather than AdWords.  Higher paying verticals include:
automotive: $1-7 possible (I used to manage ad sales & ops at a larger automotive site; for some time we served 50-80M impressions a month to Google)
travel: $2-6 (I've spoken with several sites in this vertical that rely on G)<p>Other major consideration in managing your ad network revenue is to equate everything out to your net effective CPM, since many entry-level networks will pay you on a rev-share or CPC/CPA basis.  Taking the total revenue you receive and dividing by (total impressions / 1000) can help you compare many diff sources on an equal basis.<p>Hope that helps.

If I remember right (it's been awhile since I read it), Gladwell mentioned this explicitly, just not as a major point the kind of which he drills into the reader's mind: 10,000 hours are necessary, but not sufficient.<p>Isaac Newton, Henry Ford, and Andrew Carnegie* could not have accomplished what they did without devoting themselves in outmost sincerity to their ideas. The point is that to have a truly lasting impact on improving the world for the better, you need to devote at least 10,000 hours to something great and be smart about how you devote those 10,000 hours.<p>Galdwell's point, from my reading of his book, is the hypothesis that the vast majority of people don't achieve Greatness because they don't begin to devote that kind of time to one aspiration, not because they are somehow inherently limited in their mental capacity. In other words, the world is full of unmotivated genius, and you're very likely one of them. Study hard, work hard, and strive for the stars, etc., etc. ;)<p>* having recently met Larry Page for the first time during an internal Q&A session, I can assure you his intelligence is quite limited by human capacity, as well. Yes, he's a lot better at answering sensitive and badly phrased questions (my own) candidly and to-the-point than anyone I've known, but he's also had more experience with it than anyone I've known, also. However, he didn't seem inherently talented in any way than the smarter of my professors (I was once told by one who knew him that neither was Einstein).<p>In essence, there are two points we sometimes lose in overly simplified metaphors:<p>1) there are a lot of really intelligent people changing the world for the better that aren't famous. A lot of the time, they don't want to be famous because it would get into the way of their work.<p>2) there is a big difference between famous people who publicize themselves as an a means to an end (their ideas), while others publicize themselves out of ego.

I'm typing this on a Mac and actually own an iPhone, even if I use a HTC Desire instead. But that doesn't make caring about freedom ""thoughtless spin"". Using words like that doesn't do justice to a legitimate concern. Getting locked into a platform is a serious pain. I also don't agree with the idea that you can do pretty much whatever you want on Android as it comes pre-installed on your phone, which is how most regular people use their phones (just like the fact that they don't jailbreak their iPhones). That argument seems like the same black and white ""free"" vs. ""draconian lock down"" comparison that you disagree with.<p>Apple knows that mainstream consumers don't care about freedom, just like most citizens don't really care about limitations to their civil rights until it gets to the point where they are groped by the TSA on the airport (i.e. the ""if you've got nothing to hide..."" mentality). Living in a country like Singapore definitely has its benefits, just as closed computer platforms do. If you're not a power user your data usually doesn't matter that much, anyway, so losing it if you switch to another system doesn't seem like such a big deal when you're deciding about what product to buy. This is exactly the reason why people buy a new version of Microsoft Office every two years. To me, however, my data matters and I get frustrated when I can't synch my iPhone from my GNU/Linux box without jumping through all sorts of hoops. I might not be the typical user, but I still want free platforms to disrupt closed ones (note that disrupt doesn't mean that I don't want them to coexist; choice is good). Just like I want (old versions of) Internet Explorer to die in favor of more open alternatives.<p>Just to clarify: this is not a black and white position and I don't have anything against Apple, or even Microsoft (in fact, I think Microsoft is more open than Apple these days). My main point was that having more features doesn't make or break a product, but that being said the side-note about freedom was a serious concern that I deeply care about when it comes to investing time and data into a platform.",1290101213

1918510,comment,1917474,1917993,0,0,charlesattlan,,,"I'll concede bad journalism on my part; my post was rushed and not accurate. The important part is the following taken from the official European Human rights on rights to a fair trial (6.3):<p>""Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following
minimum rights: to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of..."".<p>Publicly announcing the desired arrest goes against this idea, and that suggests systemic failure inside Sweden, and subsequent bad journalism that started in sweden and is being copied else where, particularly by the nytimes. If you compare EU coverage of the leaks; death tolls, frago 242 (an order not to actively prevent torture) and civilian casualties were the lead. In the US it has been Assange's private life. That smacks of an agenda, and nytimes actually spiked a story on frago 242 and a google search for ""site:nytimes.com frago 242"" comes back with 4 useless results. Search ""site:guardian.co.uk ""frago 242"" and you get 164 good results.<p>The initial stub was utter trash, barely above a copy-and-paste of a Swedish tabloid with the good bits removed. The nytimes pushed this article as soon as they could without possibly fact checking. The lengthened article is a little bit better, but still uses any excuse to push the rape charges and the idea that he is a wanted man. More accurately is Assange perhaps facing charges of molestation which is a better translation, and what did he do? Assange claims he had sex (there has been a claim else where this could be unprotected sex) with multiple partners who found out and retrospectively took revenge through legal proceedings. And remember the media has pushed the ""rape"" charges without evidence, initially just hearsay and from leaked police reports. Again that goes against the idea of a fair trial.<p>I believe there is deceit or incompetence somewhere, and that is not produced from cognitive dissonance. The evidence I use is how botched the process has been. If there was evidence of rape, a very serious claim, he could have been arrested in Sweden at the time. He was told he was free to leave, without even the need for an interview. Months have gone by and no attempt had been made. Now he is out of the country (Sweden) it all conspires to portray him as a guilty man on the run. That is the narrative that is being pushed; ignoring the 15,000 deaths the Pentagon lied about, the hint of a molestation is more important.",1290101108

When an employer makes you an offer, they want you to accept. They go to a lot of work to approve that piece of paper, they want to save money but they don't want to have you decline. They ESPECIALLY don't want to give you a low offer and lose you to another employer who outbids them.<p>If you say that in the past five years your compensation has ranged from $50,000 to $150,000, most people will assume that it was $50,000 five years ago and $150,000 today.<p>If they offer you $55,000 or even $75,000, they are essentially asking you to move backwards in life. They know full well that most people do not wish to move backwards, so they are wasting your time and theirs.<p>Worse, if they can afford $125,000 or $150,000 and they offer you $100,000, they risk losing you to OtherCo, who are prepared to pay $125,000. This is not good business.<p>But the question here isn't whether giving""X"" is harmful, it's how does it help? Well, many times they think their budget is $50,000. if you tell them $150,000, you don't even get a call.<p>But what if the hiring manager actually meets you and looks at your Github and takes you to lunch with the team, and loves you? Then he can take your resumé ""upstairs"" to the board of directors or wherever and plead for more money.<p>If you give X and Y, you may get to meet that manager. If you only give Y, you may not.<p>It's entirely up to you. Given my experience, I believe that saying ""no"" is the best option if you can still get the interview, but giving X and Y is optimal if (a) you can't get the interview without it, and (b) you actually want to work for that employer if they pony up the lettuce you want.<p>If your experience differs, I can appreciate choosing a  different strategy.

1918404,comment,1916893,1917421,0,0,saucetenuto,,,"It's important to be able to delete dead code even if your developers never write any, because earlier compiler optimization passes can create dead code.  For example, consider this simple function written in a hypothetical dynamic language:<p><pre><code>  function add(a,b) { return a + b }
</code></pre>
Our hypothetical compiler turns this function into some IL that looks like this:<p><pre><code>  function add1(a,b)
  {
    if(is_null(a)) throw ArgumentNullException()
    if(is_null(b)) throw ArgumentNullException()
    low_level_generic_add(a,b)
  }
</code></pre>
...where low_level_generic_add sums a and b if they're integers, or looks for a suitable overloaded operator+ and invokes it if they're not.<p>Suppose further that our hypothetical language has a tracing JIT, and that most of the time when a and b are called, they're both integers.  In that case, the compiler might perform the following transformation:<p><pre><code>  function add2(a,b)
  {
    if(is_integer(a) && is_integer(b)) return add_integers(a,b)
    else return add_generic(a,b)
  }
</code></pre>
...where add_generic is just a copy of add1 above, and add_integers is a copy of add1 with low_level_generic_add() replaced by the less-expensive perform_integer_addition()<p><pre><code>  function add_integers(a,b)
  {
    if(is_null(a)) throw ArgumentNullException()
    if(is_null(b)) throw ArgumentNullException()
    perform_integer_addition(a,b)
  }
</code></pre>
But suppose one more thing: let's say integers in this language are value types; that is, that is_null(some_integer) is never true.  Then you can get another performance win in add_integers by removing the two null checks - but you can only find out about that if you have a dead code detector.<p>This has been your woefully incomplete dynamic compilation moment.",1290099610

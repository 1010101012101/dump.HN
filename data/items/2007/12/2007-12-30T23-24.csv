I took it from a site that encouraged developers familiar with a language to submit solutions. <p>The developer of the Java solution posted something I'd consider reasonably representative of the Java I would likely encounter from most Java programmers and I while I have almost no personal experience with Ruby, I have the feeling the Ruby solution is reasonably close to what Ruby programmers write.<p>While you can write concise code in any language, it seems few Java programmers bother to.<p>Perhaps you should submit your solution to the original site: <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/</a>",1199059080
93754,comment,93537,93741,0,0,angryprofessor,,,"I'm hostile to colleges (and recruiters), though I don't think I count as anti-intellectual (my job is basic research).<p>My reason for opposing colleges (and recruiters) is simple: colleges/recruiters are middlemen sitting between you and the job you want. They may add some value, although in my view it is minimal (and certainly not worth the cost). But the main reason most people go to college/recruiters is simply because it is difficult to get a job without them. And if you can bypass them, you are probably better off.<p>Colleges (unlike recruiters) also suck vast amounts of money from the countries scientific infrastructure, but that's a different issue.",1199058954

93747,comment,93537,93741,0,0,curi,,,"Good intentions aren't good enough. Schooling has a tradition of imparting some knowledge, but also some irrationalities. Primarily it is coming under attack because it has trouble changing as fast as modern life changes, so the knowledge being imparted is less accurately what people want.<p>But also, one can make very serious criticisms of schools, including colleges, based on the irrationalities they cause in students, and their lack of understanding of how learning works.<p>For example, schools have heavy components of forcing students to do things ""for their own good"". That's the point of graded assignments and tests -- they help teachers monitor which students are doing as they were told, and help to exert pressure on those that don't.",1199056825

3023023,comment,3022569,3022976,1,0,danso,,,"In an ideal world, yes. But I suspect even the most particular Facebook users have FB-friended people who turn out to have a much more annoying online persona, i.e. anyone who hasn't grokked what oversharing on the Internet means.<p>In cases where de-friending a person has no real-life consequences (i.e. they're not a close friend, either in proximity or emotionally), then FB's curation saves you a little of that tedious cleanup. In cases where it is awkward to defriend someone because you have a real-life connection to them, the curation <i>may</i> save you from having to manually silence their updates.<p>I can only think of one case where I had to manually perform these silencing actions, and it was with a friend who is a good real life friend and who I communicate on FB regularly, but who has decided to make his wall a constant stream of his political beliefs. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with the convenience that FB's curation performs in auto-ignoring the people that I tend to ignore (but not necessarily dislike).<p>There's one more important aspect to this. Sometimes, a FB friend who isn't normally in your Top feed will appear because something he/she posted has gotten a lot of activity/likes. This is not so dissimilar to a place like HN, where the well-liked submissions of people I've never met are prominently visible to me. This kind of social aggregation would not happen in a situation where you've decided to shut out all people that you've decided a priori have and will have nothing of interest to you.",1316627956

3023013,comment,3020459,3021089,2,0,bri3d,,,"I think the idea behind the signed bootloader is that the kernel that the bootloader loads will then be trusted as well. In this way the chain of trust moves up the boot stack and the risk of an early-boot / kernel rootkit can be minimized, especially if the kernel also tries to verify the authenticity of all modules it loads into kernel space (which Windows already does and has for quite some time - please note that I specified ""tries"").<p>I don't think this will affect corporate Windows installations as you'd presumably be installing a signed kernel and signed drivers - as the post above yours states, it's very rare to use a non-Microsoft-supplied kernel and unsigned drivers in the corporate environment today.<p>Signing a Linux bootloader could be perceived as a potential breach of this trusted boot process, as Windows could then potentially be loading in an emulated environment created by a malicious GRUB module or the like. Chances are, nobody subscribing to Trusted Boot will ruin their marketability by either a) not providing a way to disable the trust verification or b) not signing a Linux bootloader. However, that possibility is what has the rash of speculative ""Linux won't run anymore!!!"" articles running around the internet this week.<p>More solid info on the trusted boot process can be derived from:<p><a href=""http://lanyrd.com/2011/bldwin/shkft/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanyrd.com/2011/bldwin/shkft/</a>",1316627786

I consider C++ to be a systems language (the ISO spec explicitly defines a minimal profile suitable for embedded systems for example). But C is probably a slightly more ""systems"" of a language (in no small part because it's the language which defines most system's APIs).<p><i>How do I bind these things to other languages cleanly? In C this is trivial--why isn't this fixed in C++11?</i><p>If you think this is trivial in C I suspect it's because you have so much familiarity with it and/or these other languages are implemented in C and define their external APIs directly in C. C has an unfair advantage in this regard, but it's just not that hard to integrate C++ and C.<p>Sometimes C++ has advantages too, some people swear by Boost.Python for example. Looks much simpler than C to me.<p><i>How do I load libraries of classes dynamically at runtime? From C wrappers?</i><p>That's one way. The main reason dynamic loading works in C is because the types are all so primitive (and it doesn't have ""classes""). You can use those primitive types for your APIs and in C too.<p>Another way is to define the classes interfaces in terms of something binary stable over the scope you wish to separately compile these libraries. This requires some understanding of the guarantees of the platform and complier/linker. MS-COM for example gets a lot of mileage out of some relatively minimal abstract class layout conventions.<p><i>When interfacing with old libraries (which actually do exist), how often am I going to have to write some kind of NULL-nullptr glue code?</i><p>I've been writing some C++11 with C++4.6.0 and a bunch of old libraries and haven't run into that. I don't use pointers in my code very much, so I don't think I've even had to use nullptr yet.<p>So I would think ""not very often"", at least if your coding style is similar to mine.<p><i>Why do we not have variable length arrays (they're in C99)?</i><p>I don't know why the decision was made in the language committee, but std::vector with the new initializer syntax works well for me for that purpose. Perhaps the C99 construct could be a little more efficient, but I don't see a reason that an alert compiler couldn't also allocate the storage on the stack.",1316627066

Not really, in the same way that I'm not bothered that I don't know the details of PageRank. But I'm guessing FB makes its judgment based on how much I chat with a certain person, interact with their updates and walls, and browse/stalk their profile. If that's the case, their ""Top Updates"" has been right on the mark.<p>I end up spending less time than I have to to see the ""news"" that I'm most interested in. If I log onto FB later and see that the Top UPdates largely remain the same, then I am satisfied to log back out for the day. At the same time, I'm  more engaged with Facebook as a user because I'm always seeing things that I care about, even if some of them are half a day old. Strangely, this curation saves me time from FB yet fulfills FB's mission to keep me on its site, as I'd be less enthusiastic in coming back of 7 out of 10 items in  my default news feed were drek.<p>And yes, you can say that I should maintain my friend list better and silence/unfriend the users that I don't care about...but if FB does a good job of that (the silencing part) without me needing to go through another options menu, I don't have any complaints.",1316625494

3022813,comment,3011822,3016906,1,0,learc83,,,"Yes, plenty of the places I've gone have been by plane, to tourist locations. However, I've travelled extensively by car throughout the middle to lower sections of Georgia and Alabama (fairly poor areas).<p>I'm fascinated with how technology has changed rural life, so I like to visit small towns just to observe. For instance 10 years ago I noticed fairly substantial differences in the way teenagers from rural areas dressed compared to suburban teenagers (i was a suburban teenager at the time). Now the differences, in apparel are closing rapidly. Also, when I was a kid and the Nintendo 64 came out but everyone was out of stock. All you had to do was drive to some small town (Hazlehurst, GA) Walmart to find one. Now because everyone is so connected, that same Walmart had a line out the door on the day the PS3 was released.<p>I'm also the type of person who likes to go to a city with no plan in mind and just wing it. A few friends and I, went to New Orleans about 2 years after Katrina, we got a hotel near Bourbon Street, but we spent most of our time just walking. We walked for miles, covered a huge part of the city, and definitely ended up in some places where we probably shouldn't have gone.<p>In summary, yes I've definitely been in places where one would expect to find tent cities.<p>I'm not saying they don't exist, but if you do find one, it's likely to be just a handfull of people living in the woods, not what I'd really call a ""tent city.""<p>Also there is a problem in the US, there is a financial crisis, but the average person gets up everyday and goes to work. They may be worried about the economy, but no more than the other stuff the 24 hour news warns them about (you know--child murderers, plagues, terrorists etc...)",1316624907

3022796,comment,2947519,2996708,1,0,Dove,,,"Good on you for reading and trying to respond!  Most folks would not take the time, but I see from your notes that you did.  For the sake of keeping a reasonable thread of conversation, I'll let the topic as a whole rest.  I trust you'll believe me when I say I am ready to have a book-length conversation on any of those topics -- and if you're interested in one I will! -- but my purpose is educational, not adversarial.  Even if you don't find my arguments convincing (and you would hardly be the only one), my purpose is to demonstrate to you that I am committed to an evidential and rational worldview, and that it is in fact this commitment that leads me to Christ.<p><i>""I don't know"" is a perfectly good and, best of all, honest answer to some of the questions we have today.</i><p>You are absolutely right.  I have argued in the past (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1797035"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1797035</a>) that having an explanation for everything is a sure sign of insanity.  And I stand by that. So why does the frequent ""I don't know"" in atheism bother me?<p>I would say it is part of a pattern of poor explanations and shoulder shrugs that, when taken all together, bothers me.<p>It seems to me that if you're going to reject a worldview -- and atheism is fundamentally negative -- you should be an expert on the evidence for that view.  That should be the area of your best alternative explanations, your most careful scholarship, your most reasoned opinions.  Instead, I find that what atheists write about Christianity is sloppy, often factually incorrect, and filled with ""I don't knows"" in all the areas of the most convincing evidence.  If they could give plausible alternative accounts of the origin of the Bible and church, that would be something, but more often than not, they can't even get wikipedia-able facts right!<p>I feel a bit like Galileo with his telescope, trying to show people the moons of Jupiter.  ""Look how these are always in a line, how they appear to revolve around the planet!""  People generally have not (and will not) look into the telescope, and when they do, they say, ""I don't know.""<p>That's certainly their right.  I would never deny that.  But why would I find such skepticism in the face of evidence attractive?<p>Why would anyone find it rationally attractive?<p><i>I am of the opinion that the evidence will lead you away from sources that claim to know about the unknowable especially when those sources need to rely on threats of eternal punishment.</i><p>My experience differs.  I've spent my adult live studying the evidence as honestly as I know how.  And while I've lost and changed a lot of opinions over the years, my faith in the reality of God and the reliability of the Bible and the person of Jesus grow stronger every time I learn something new.<p>And I think you would be surprised at how hell figures into all of this.  I like to say that life on earth is either a little heaven or a little hell.  I don't so much choose heaven over hell for eternity as I choose heaven over hell for the next five minutes.<p>But let me ask you.  If there was one thing I should read and study, one thing that would really blow my mind and make me doubt Christianity, what would you recommend?<p><i>As far as atheistic belief relying on vain things and Christians beliefing things despite riticule: the last I heard is that the statistic is like 93% of people believe in God. Is it also the case that atheists are still the most hated group in America? Either way, peer pressure doesn't work that way. If you want pride you will find it on any side of any argument, just as you will find smarmy repugnent a-holes, and complete idiots. I'm sorry that you seem to have had many bad encounters. All I can say is that it seems like it is easy to become embittered on the internet by all of the rampent inflamatory crap on here. Sorry.</i><p>Well, those 93% are hardly kind to each other.  The experience of following Christ in Christian society is often like the experience of Telemachus in Christian Rome (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Telemachus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Telemachus</a>).<p>But your point is fair -- everyone has troubles, and persecution does not justify anyway.<p>And thank you.",1316624657

This is no small accomplishment, which anyone knowing just a little bit about how the IT departments in the banking industry normally works, the systems they work on are arcane.<p>It took us 18 months from getting the bank to like the idea into actually getting it launched.<p>The results have been nothing but extraordinary everyone loves it.<p>The reason they love it is because it's automatic. They get insights into their economy that they could not previously get. There is something quite amazing about seeing your spendings categorized for the first time without you having to do anything.<p>The banks have a unique identifier on each transaction that can be measured up against a category list. This is something Mint and Wesabe can't do because you can't export that unique identifer from the banks.<p>The big advantage of BankSimple and why I think it's going to be huge is because they don't have a legacy system to deal with.<p>In other words BankSimple can potentially be anything you could ever dream of a bank being, because BankSimple will be able to cross reference the data in order to provide not just cost reduction but service improvement.<p>The banking industry are just waiting to be disrupted by someone like BS.

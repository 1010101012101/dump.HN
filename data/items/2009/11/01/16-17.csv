915227,comment,915070,915070,0,0,tokenadult,,,"A quick comment: An IQ score on any test above IQ 160 is not a validated score, and should be considered comparable to IQ scores in the usual range on current, carefully validated tests of 40 to 160. Moreover, the standard form of scoring IQ tests does not, and cannot, yield an IQ score with interval characteristics, as Terman and Merrill (1937, p. 25) recognized.<p>""The expression of a test result in terms of age norms is simple and unambiguous, resting upon no statistical assumptions. A test so scaled does not pretend to measure intelligence as a linear distance is measured by the equal units of a foot-rule, but tells us merely that the ability of a given subject corresponds to the average ability of children of such and such an age. This was all that Binet claimed to accomplish, and one can well doubt whether the voluminous output of psychometric literature since his day has enabled us to accomplish more. We have accordingly chosen to retain this least pretentious of units for the estimation of mental level.""<p>The numbers yielded by an IQ test are not measures, but rather more like decathlon scores (Hunt 1997). Indeed, IQ scores analogize quite aptly to the arbitrary rating numbers assigned by college rating guides to different colleges and universities, even in how they differ from one brand of IQ test to another.<p>The earliest mental tester, Galton, recognized that he had no ""foot rule."" Early on, he was frustrated by the lack of an ""external standard of measurement"" for what he was investigating, and resolved to report his results as a rank-ordering of subjects, without a ""foot-rule"" (Galton 1880). The best considered view is that IQ tests and other mental ability tests are not measures at all. Certainly they should not be analogized to rulers. An IQ score, despite the analogies appealed to by some authors, is not like a marking on a ruler related to an absolute scale but is on an ordinal scale (Mackintosh 1998, pp. 30-31). Alfred Binet warned against this error early on, writing, ""This scale properly speaking does not permit the measure of the intelligence, [1] because intellectual qualities are not superposable, and therefore cannot be measured as linear surfaces are measured, but are on the contrary, a classification, a hierarchy among diverse intelligences;"" (Binet 1905, English translation 1916).<p>See also<p><a href=""http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/history.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/history.html</a><p>for background on high-IQ societies and their founders.<p>After edit: I can also provide a reference to specifically disagree with one statement in the submitted article. ""Wechsler is saying quite plainly that those with IQs above 150 are different in kind from those below that level. He is saying that they are a different kind of mind, a different kind of human being."" But David Feldman (1984), in a specialized study of study subjects who scored above 180 on their IQ tests, noted:<p>""Put into the context of the psychometric movement as a whole, it is clear that positive extreme of the IQ distribution is not as different from other IQ levels as might have been expected. . . . While 180 IQ suggests the ability to do academic work with relative ease, it does not signify a qualitatively different organization of mind. It also does not suggest the presence of ‘genius’ in its common-sense meaning, i.e. transcendent achievement in some field. For these kinds of phenomena, IQ seems at best a crude predictor. For anything more, we will have to look to traditions other than the psychometric and to variables other than IQ.""<p>REFERENCES<p>Binet, Alfred. (1916).

If some of those reservations are held by scalpers, and the scalpers don't find a buyer, the table will be empty when it may have been used if not for the actions of the scalpers.<p>What the students did was to break this unenforceable contract, and convert an agreement to make a transaction at some point in the future into a pure option on their part. That's stealing value.<p>If the restaurants want to do this, that's one thing. If the restaurant attempts to cultivate an image of being the hip spot to be seen, then it's in their interest to seat anyone dressed nice, or has money to throw around, or whatever, preferentially. But I would expect that they take this factor into account when setting the wages of the maitre d, just as they account for tips when setting the waiters' wages. Thus, the restaurant captures the value.<p>If this became prevalent, I would expected restaurants to move back to a model of calling names, or asking the name as if they can't tell from what number buzzer you had. Psychologically, buying a buzzer would seem okay to a lot of people who would not be comfortable if what you were selling is ""listen for Charlie, party of 4, and say you're Charlie"".<p>All the above applies equally to buzzers or waiting in an physical queue. If the queue is visibly large or if the host says it's a 45 minute wait rather than a 20 minute wait, some patrons will go elsewhere.",1257094358

There's a bit more coherence than I'm seeing from such things. On the other hand, it does show a lot of one of the hallmarks of such writing, which is referring to various non-standard premises like the ""Mind Equals Reality principle"" that I can find no explanation for on the net beyond what is seen in that writing, and tends to cloak an idea that can only be sort of expressed in fuzzy words in vaguely mathematical garb that really only exists in the author's head.

The theory, such as it is, is cloaked in scientific jargon, but has no correspondence with the real world.)<p>Hard to tell. It would depend on whether the ideas actually have a backing that one could get at in conversation, or whether this is it. When pressed for details, the difference is the paranoid-schizophrenic ideation is endlessly recursive (talk to the timecube guy as much as you like, but you'll never get anywhere; back him into a logical corner and he simply starts insulting you), whereas real ideas can actually be shown to be grounded in something else real.",1257094343

Creating them by hand is a major source of pain, greater than with C/C++. The automatic generation on the other hand is troublesome for at least two reasons:<p>1) It's very sensitive to the contents of .d files. For instance, It leaves the bodies of inline-able functions in, thus if you modify such a function in the .d file, it will again mean a change spill to the .di and modules importing it (directly and indirectly). Similarly if you just reorder the functions in a module or change a private constant. This could partially be mitigated by a sufficiently smart build tool that tracks symbol importing, aliasing and usage in order to infer the modules that need to be recompiled. Sadly, this is quite complex and no current tool does it at the moment.<p>2) It assumes none of the functions will be used at compile-time (by stripping away function bodies depending on whether they may be inlined), which forces you to stuff them all into compile-time-only modules.",1257092995

I can't do justice to someone else's voice, but a few minutes were all that was necessary to make the first paragraph sound like a person:<p>(translated from semi-scientific posturing) ""One of the things that makes us human is thinking about the big picture. Unfortunately, it's easy to make simple mistakes in the attempt think about the biggest picture: the universe. (Please understand that by 'the universe', I mean to say <i>everything</i>; it makes no sense to me to speak of things that aren't a part of the universe.) I sometimes unthinkingly imagine about the universe as the collection of all the things that exist; and that makes sense, doesn't it? \nMaybe not. What about pi? The relationship between a the diameter of a circle and it's circumference appears in all kinds of surprising places --- it seems like it is an inherent part of the universe. Pi doesn't exist on it's own, though; at least, I can't imagine pi, floating in space all by itself. Pi seems to be a part of the fabric in which everything else exists. Any theory of the universe must take that <i>fabric</i> into account as well. As far as anyone can tell, the laws that underly the universe, the fabric, is the same everywhere. The fabric unifies the universe. So if I try to think about the universe sensibly, I can't talk about anything outside of it (a philosopher might say 'use monism instead of dualism'), and I must explain the unified whole (holism rather than reductionism).""<p>Chris Langan, wherever you are, you can do it!

I agree that, initially, large classes will be the target. But in the longer term, it comes down to economics. Universities keep getting more expensive -- their costs rises faster than inflation. Much of the cost of a university is the salaries of faculty and staff. The only real way to keep the cost down is to teach students in a different, more efficient way. So I wouldn't be surprised if most students end up being taught in ways that don't allow for things like assessing body language. I agree that it's better, but it's expensive.",1257091521

Or, <i>""guns don't kill people, people kill people""</i><p>The other half of this complaint i think is somewhat elitist (unwittingly so?) and it seems to do with the notion that because there is a such a low barrier to entry, that much js code is cargo-culted, but i've seen this from developers in every language. What I find even worse than cargo-cult code is  Pattern Zealots going about specifically coding up Pattern X in javascript. It's like they studied Design Patterns but the point of it just went over their heads.<p>Knowing the principles of software development doesn't prevent you from making ridiculous decisions[1]. It seems like everyone wants checklists of coding standards or <i>something</i> for measuring code quality / standards compliance these days in js. But these are hollow measures if the code behind the module/black box/library is just plain wrong.<p>Maybe i'm missing something here, but <i>why</i> is this article getting voted up?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1635800/javascript-best-singleton-pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1635800/javascript-best-s...</a> (found when googling 'javascript singleton')",1302979919

2454566,comment,2454017,2454017,2,0,edash,,,"I recently did some fundraising and employee grants with an LLC and it was more complicated than you'd think...<p>You should make sure your grants have a ""distribution hurdle."" If you don't have a distribution hurdle, the options you're granting may be taxed as income immediately upon receipt. This would leave your employees with a big tax bill.<p>You should put everyone on a reasonable vesting schedule. With vesting, everyone is in it for the long-term and the shares given directly correlate to the work performed and the value provided to the company.<p>You should talk with your employees and agree in advance to the work being performed in exchange for shares granted during the vesting period. There is no clean way to include this in the operating agreement or grant notice, so communication is crucial. If either party is ever dissatisfied with their side of the arrangement, however, they can always leave. And if you've set up vesting appropriately, both sides should still be happy even if you don't reach the end of the vesting period.<p>Why would you want to prevent employee grants from diluting in the future? It breaks the alignment of incentives. If everyone dilutes equally, everyone has the same incentives regarding future investments. An investment would only be accepted if everyone thought the trade-off of money for equity was worth it based on the current valuation.<p>But if you DO want to prevent dilution, it's a fairly straight-forward clause you can add to the operating agreement. I'd suggest setting a ceiling or an expiry date for the dilution prevention clause. This ensures that if things change dramatically in the future, you won't be handicapped by your non-diluted employee grants.<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer. This is for entertainment purposes only.

Having done a lot of iOS dev, Garbage Collection isn't even in my top 10 wants (his claim that it adding it would halve iOS dev times is bunkum).

His repeated use of ""fanboy"" also gives the article -20 karma: Apple, and Apple developers never said multitasking is evil, just that unrestricted desktop (i.e power unlimited device) multitasking was a poor fit - a position that's still true.<p>For iOS, I do want: Better notification system. The ability to silently respond to pushes (i.e. Update my databases without showing any UI). Better system wide connectivity notifications. Better inter-app connectivity (something like Androids intents, I guess). Cocoa data bindings. A sync service API (desktop to iOS or web service to iOS).<p>I do <i>not</i> want iOS to become OS X, or a desktop OS. That is not helpful to me, or my users.

I admit that understanding just why they're generally a bad idea (and the problems they cause for people writing JS interpreters) requires an understanding of some subtleties of the scope model.<p>> The most difficult part of all, knowing how to tie all these tools together into clean, robust, fast, maintainable, and cross browser compatible code.<p>Finally, something that uncontentiously belongs on an 'advanced' list!

2454547,comment,2453988,2454295,3,0,lambda,,,"Well, it favors people who invest a little time and effort into mining (it's still relatively cheap to do, if you assume that bitcoins will continue to be valuable), and especially favors those who get in early to help support the currency in its formative stage (which is good for the value of the whole bitcoin economy).<p>You need to distribute the initial bitcoins somehow, and these people are putting value in by protecting the network from scammers (the reason for mining is that you're doing a lot of hard work to validate transactions, forming a long chain of valid transactions, such that it would be quite difficult to form an alternative chain in which an attacker spends money differently). So, miners are providing the security of the network, and helping roll out the currency slowly and smoothly, as well as speculating on the future value of bitcoins, so they do deserve to receive some compensation for their efforts.<p>If you feel like bitcoins will be valuable in the future, and don't want to get into mining, then sell some goods or services for bitcoins. If you happened to have sold a loaf of bread for BTC 50 last October (about $2.50 back then), you could now trade that for $50; that's a pretty good return on your investment. Don't worry about the miners are getting money for nothing; they are help making the whole system work, and there are plenty of ways of earning bitcoins besides mining.",1302979302

A decade ago I remember asking for a job as a Java developer by taking the source code for a Scheme interpreter written in Java into the interview.

2454510,comment,2453988,2454295,12,0,ataggart,,,">Why is Bitcoin a good currency again?<p>It isn't, but almost anything can work if the community of users is small enough. As for why it isn't, we need to step back a bit.<p>In a barter economy an exchange occurs when two individuals each produce something which takes time/labor/capital and which the other person values more than what they're giving up. For example, if I grow an apple, and you grow an orange, and we trade, it is clear[1] that I value the orange more than the apple, and you value the apple more than the orange (otherwise we wouldn't have made the exchange). The value of those items is individually subjective[2], and the supply of those items is constrained by market forces (e.g., alternate uses of time, labor, and capital).<p>A money economy emerges from a barter economy when individuals accept in exchange something they do not want for itself, but with the anticipation that they can use it for some future exchange. It is critical that the commodity in question be desirable <i>eventually</i>. If no one ever wants it, then it wouldn't emerge <i>as money</i>. (Important Aside: once a commodity begins to function as money, part of the demand for the commodity will be as money, thus there is positive feedback loop, but some non-money demand needs to exist to get the process running. This is why all functioning fiat currencies have their roots in a commodity money.)<p>It's important to notice that commodity money has some <i>inherent</i> constraint on its creation (i.e., its supply curve is bounded by market forces), and that it satisfies the wants of others (i.e., there exists some demand curve). For example, the gold supply is constrained by the cost of mining/processing new gold, and the demand affected by its consumption into produced goods and demand to hold ""cash balances"" of gold.<p>So far as I can tell, bitcoin is a scheme whose total supply is constrained only by an exogenous, artificial limit of 21M coins, and not by the demand for alternative uses of its factors of production[3]. There can be, <i>at most</i>, a marginal value[4] equal to the marginal cost of producing a coin, which appears to be nothing but otherwise-idle computer time and some electricity.<p>But far more importantly, this is a scheme whereby artificial scarcity is created (e.g., it takes n hours to produce a coin) but no thing of value is produced. This would be akin to inventing a system of money involving sticks whittled into perfect cylinders. Sure it might take a long time to create one, and it might consume resources, but if the end result doesn't have any value to anyone, it isn't money, it's just waste.<p>""The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalism</a>",1302978058

And such behavior really shouldn't rise to national mockery.<p>His statements and the dialog from everyone were actually somewhat interesting.<p>But as far as that thread went, and your behavior while moderating it, the thread went downhill into a Scott Adams bashfest by the second and sixth's comments.<p>As a moderator, you allowed ad hominem celebrity bashing in as part of your community rules, but you disliked it when said celebrity comes in to defend himself and suddenly he is outed because he violated your rules.<p>Well, ... I think your rules that essentially do not permit this guy to defend himself unless he writes under his own name are lousy rules because no one else had to write under their name.<p>You didn't examine who the pseudonyms of the other commenters were.  For all we know, it's his ex-wife, or some feminist blogger still angry with him, or someone else with an agenda.<p>I don't know what common mefi behavior is -- I think in your position I would have either ignored it, or as a moderator, asked everyone to get back on track and knock off the pile-on.",1302977162

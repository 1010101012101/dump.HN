I get asked why all the time and my standard joke come back is ""because it's there.""<p>But in reality I also enjoy the suffering.  There have been many hard hikes where I could simply turn around and the only person who would know is me, but I kept going anyways.  You're someone who can understand the feeling of simply focusing on your next step and having the rest of the world melt away.  After dealing with complexities all day at work it's nice to do something so...simple.  Climb this mountain or lift this weight (I also love powerlifting with deadlifts being my absolute favorite).<p><i>When I rest I feel utterly lifeless except that my throat burns when I draw breath...I can scarcely go on.  No despair, no happiness, no anxiety.  I have not lost the mastery of my feelings, there are actually no more feelings.  I consist only of will.</i>  -Messner talking about his first solo ascent of Everest",1287518299

1808476,comment,1807445,1807445,0,0,Jkeg,,,"I've moved on from Opera. It took them forever to implement basic usability features such as text box spell-check, and inline password remember/find in page. They also removed great features such as one click bookmarking. Their widgets used to be great, one hot-key and they'd all pop-up on screen like on OSX. Now you have to basically manage each one individually with multiple clicks and they clutter your taskbar like crazy. Meanwhile they focus on low value features like Unite. In the default install, it takes several clicks just to get to your list of bookmarks (ignoring hotkeys or custimization, from a business perspective this is bad.)<p>These aren't just flukes, it seems to be a pattern in their priorities that has shifted in the past few years. Away from low friction usability and innovative features to something a bit more convoluted. Opera used to be top of the pack in usability, even for non-power users. But now for some reason they lost their edge. And aside from this reddit AMA, it seems to be very difficult to have a discussion with them about changes to the browser.

As languages get more lisp-like, it seems as if they would become <i>more</i> conducive to a graphical programming environment.<p>I imagine looking at something that looks a lot like lisp - it shows the high-level structure of the code as a tree. But it could allows me to change the level of abstraction I'm viewing on the fly. Also, it could reveal (or hide, at my preference) lots of metadata about the code... is it pure, is it stateful, is it parallel, etc.<p>In essence, it allows you to look at your code as an n-dimensional entity instead of a 2 dimensional file.<p>Basically, I'd like to see what happens when you decouple the code from its presentation.

Cloudfront lets you create multiple CNAMEs per distribution so I created a CNAME for images1.domain.com through images10.domain.com to my distribution.  In my app I created a simple hashing algorithm to assign the right subdomain (basically it takes an MD5 of the filename, looks at the second character, converts hex to dec and that is the number of the subdomain).  That way any given image gets served from the same subdomain to take advantage of caching.  And the bonus is that Cloudfront assigns each of the CNAMEs a different IP address.",1287517102

1808301,comment,1806944,1807973,0,0,aspir,,,"Ditto to everything maxawaytoolong posted<p>TLDR: Mostly lost water weight. I'd done it enough to really know how my body worked. I knew the exercise techniques that worked particularly well for me, and I ate a super-clean diet.<p>This wasn't a Jared Fogel style ""I lost x lbs."" He lost fat/tissue. For wrestlers, it's mostly a water cut. In sports like wrestling, boxing, or anything with a weight division you may need to lose water weight to get down to the cap of your division. I was 171 in HS and 197-184 in college. You have to be below the division cap (any over 171 in this case would get you DQ'ed).<p>Water weight isn't too hard to lose when you start. In your sleep, we all lose from 1-3 lbs, then we use the restroom when we wake up (.3-.6 lbs). If you start with a workout in the morning (1-2 lbs depending on the workout), you can walk 2-3 more lbs off throughout the day. Of course, normal people eat and drink in the course of the day to ""refill."" Over time, you get to the point where you know how to master this cycle, with extra workouts to boost it, and control your diet to engage the metabolic systems. It's a delicate balance.<p>In college, I wasn't a starter who had to weight in weekly, so I wasn't always close to weight. Even though we'd work out 2-3 hours a day, we have our bodies to the point where an extra push is required to get down to size. Typically, someone my size and structure should never have been more than 5-10 lbs overweight at most. I just came in one Monday weighing a great deal, and I was also tapped to start for that match to give our starter a rest. Since my resting/homeostasis weight was 5-10 lbs over, losing the first 10 lb chunk was easy. The next portion was a little rougher, but I'd been doing this for 7 years (HS + college), so I knew how to do it.<p>As for the techniques, I would run, jump rope, and wrestle wearing sweats. Wrestling has a higher caloric exertion rate than boxing, which is already way higher than running or jumping rope alone. Our college facilites also had a steam room, so I would clock time there to keep my sweat up after finishing a workout.<p>As for diet, I'd start each meal with a couple big glasses of water, so I wasn't quite as hungry and wouldn't binge. I'd then eat nutrient-dense vegetables (spinach salad, bell peppers, seeds, berries). Then eat lean protein (chicken breast, fish, no beef). To end I'd either drink a V8 or a yogurt shake. After all of that water and nutrient dense food, you feel stuffed.<p><i>All this being said, you'd have to be completely moronic to try to rapidly that much lose water weight without having done so before. Do. Not. Try. This. At. Home. Trained athletes have died doing this wrong</i>",1287514987

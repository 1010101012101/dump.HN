System A might actually be perfectly fine and correct, and B as well, but the <i>relationship</i> between A and B is broken. Change the database schema, and the app can no longer read it. Change the dns, and the UI can no longer find the API. For any decently complex application, the potential sources of failure are in the thousands, and potential interactions effectively infinite.

Look at google. They know search is about to change majorly, they have already spun into a meta-architecture. Doing things quickly, capturing that value, and then adapting is the only way to survive.

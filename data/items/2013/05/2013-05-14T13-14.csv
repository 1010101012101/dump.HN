There is a remarkable amount of bandwagoning in this thread to bash anything vaguely pro-American followed by some self-congratulatory posts about people today ""not knowing history"". That goes both ways, people.<p>The US has done an immeasurable amount of good in the world over the years, for example the US is <i>by far and away</i> the largest donor of foreign aid in the world and has been for a long time. I think most people are angry that what the country represents at face value is not always reflected in policy or actions. That's fine. Get involved and do something about it.",1368539994

Sittin in the office, sure.  Walking around the grocery store, sure.  Walk around the block at home, sure.  A day of yard work, sure.  But never wear new boots on a trail.  Many groups will kick you out and send you home if your boots aren't looking old and scruffy enough, nothing personal they just don't want to have to do wilderness rescue on you.<p>2) Bring more water than you think you'll need.  Newbies always guess low.  If you're feeling thirsty you've already failed.  If you don't end the hike with water leftover you've failed.<p>3) It's considered very poor form to have to ask someone else for first aid stuff, although its considered even worse form not to help someone who needs it, and the cheapest lightest smallest kit is probably about right.  Doesn't have to be some giant backpack a little pocket sized thing is fine.<p>Everything else you can learn from the group.  Leave No Trace philosophy and orienteering and all that stuff.

The general idea is that you use a concurrent dispatch queue to provide concurrent read access and then use barriers to obtain an exclusive write lock to the resource. There were significant performance benefits from the change as I was able to shift the cache updates on a miss into the background. The dispatch queue approach also outperformed `NSCache` significantly under the workloads I was testing -- it appears that some of its internal calculations on add/remove can be quite costly if you are adding/removing rapidly.<p>Its also very flexible, as you can do `dispatch_sync` if you need a synchronous fetch of the resource or use callback blocks to go as async as possible.",1368539217

High intensity interval training did become very popular in the 80s/90s because one could seemingly get very quick results from relatively few hours spent training. However, Americans were always outperformed by African runners.<p>That is until recently since a new trend of running very long distances at a low intensity for training became popular, just as runners from Kenya and Ethiopia do. Now Americans who employ the latter tactic are starting to fair better on the international scene, even reaching the podium for some long distance events. More American collegiate athletes who are employing the low-intensity, long distance training strategy are clocking sub-4 minute miles as well which is a hallmark of elite running status.<p>It seems counter-intuitive that low intensity running over long distances should improve high intensity short-distance times, but the proof is in the pudding.<p>Interval training can increase your lactate threshold, or your body's ability to remove lactic acid from your muscles while you are engaging in high intensity activities (the same acid that causes that burning sensation we all love to hate), but it doesn't do that much for your VO2max which determines how effectively your body uses oxygen.<p>Most pro endurance athletes mix interval training with long distance training to get the benefit of both strategies.

They could well have paid some one to do it (coding, managing etc). Still you will see then right in the middle of the action. The simple reason is, most people love it.<p>Sure. If you want to do this yourself because you love it, great. But don't pretend it's because you can't stand the thought of some people being without water - if that was really the issue, you'd care about the most efficient way to solve this rather than doing it yourself.",1368536767

In <i>my</i> undergraduate degree (which I believe to be fairly standard for the US), Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics were both part of a one-semester classical mechanics course, along with much else.

5704530,comment,5704127,5704127,4,0,masto,,,"Sorry, this turned out not to be a simple yes/no.  I thought I would explain, as a hiring manager, what goes through my head:<p>> 28 years old with a Finance Degree from a non-Ivy league school<p>Don't care.<p>> Spent the last two years living overseas teaching English<p>Ok, no background in programming for a living, but this is a junior role, so keep reading...<p>> and learning to code<p>Ah, so is this learning to code because the economy sucks and I heard coding is lucrative, or learning to code because I discovered programming and realized it's what I was born to do..<p>> Fairly well versed in html, css, javascript, and PHP<p>This, and the word ""junior"" are the part that jumps out and all I really care about.  I put very little value in resumes, they are dead documents and I'm trying to hire living people.  If I'm hiring a coder, I need to see them in person, and I need to see them code.  The resume is only useful so I can pick out a few things to set the initial direction of the conversation.  If you came in for an interview, we'd grill you on the stuff you claim to know well.  I don't expect you to be an expert in building large scale client-side applications, but if that's the job, I need to make sure you have the fundamentals down, and that you ""think like a software engineer"".  Look at it from my point of view: I'm taking a chance on someone who might grow with the opportunity and contribute value to the business, or might bring the whole team down with sloppiness, laziness, or just mediocrity and a sense of indifference.  So I'm trying to answer some questions:<p>* Do you care about the craft of software engineering, beyond just slapping stuff together?<p>* What is your approach to code quality?  Maintainability?  Testability?  Documentation?<p>* Are you a fast learner?  Can you hit the ground running with someone else's code base?<p>* Are you self-motivated?  Can you finish a project and ship it?  Can I trust you to work without being micromanaged?<p>* Do you know how and when to ask for help or more information?<p>* Can you work well as part of a team?<p>* Am I going to get more out of you than I put in? (Eventually)<p>Of course, I don't ask these questions directly, I'm looking for evidence, a little bit from your work history, but much more from the way you handle problem solving in the ridiculously inefficient, artificial, and constrained environment of a job interview.  This is why it's so hard to hire the right people, and so hard for the right people to get hired.  The best you can hope for is that everyone involved knows how the system sucks and has some techniques for dealing with it.",1368536406

The feedback and publicity could be worth the trouble. And the whole process could be seen as a helpful winnowing process, siphoning money towards more-likely-to-succeed ventures.<p>But as structured, not only does Revolutionary Angels want their 40% overhead fee, but also equity in the winner.

In one direction (North?) you'll pass by some amazing Indian, Thai, and Vietnamese restaurants.  You'll also probably pass by my favorite sushi hole-in-the wall (Hana sushi). Sushi-o-sushi is also good.  In the other direction, you'll head towards San Jose. First you'll pass by some great cafe's.  Keep heading down and you'll find the ultimate Mexican eatery La Victoria. Actually, anything Mexican in San Jose is bound to be great.  If you go to La Poloma (El Camino North) you can find an incredible happy hour--free enchiladas and nachos and $2.00 house margaritas.  Around the corner from La Victoria though you'll find Sonoma Chicken Coop. You'll be amazed that you can get a full, moderately healthy meal for under $7.00 and served to you in about 5 minutes.  There's also a New Orleans style restaurant near the HP center which is delicious.  If you're going fancy there's Il Fornario Italian or Birk's Steakhouse.  Outside Santa Clara but a short drive away there's some great restaurants in Santana Row.  There's a great Egyptian restaurant near here too, but I can't think of the name of it.

The comments in the previous thread nay-saying the idea of taking depression seriously as a life-threatening problem sound especially stark in light of the later thread.<p>Lifetime incidence of at least one period of depressed mood is fairly high across humankind, but that's over the course of a whole lifetime. It is UNUSUAL for young people to have prolonged (days-long) episodes of depressed mood if they haven't had a parent die or something like that. That's an issue that should be looked into. Untreated depression is a huge cause of mortality among young people. Young people in developed countries don't die of much else besides traffic accidents (and at least some deaths of young people that are reported as traffic accidents may be misreported suicides).<p>There is also the issue of subsequent degradation of a person's quality of life if depression is not treated when the person is young. Most twenty-somethings are resilient enough to get through quite a few episodes of depression and to stay employed and to stay in romantic relationships, but each depressive episode tends to cost a patient work productivity, intimacy with significant others, and other sources of personal reserves for the next episode. Physicians have taken care in multiple research projects to develop diagnostic screening tools that standardize how much by way of depressive symptoms is enough to be of concern. If you have a concern, get the opinion of someone with clinical experience and see if you can go through life without repeated episodes of feeling worse (and doing worse) than you need to. If a young person is depressed for days at a time a few times a year, that young person has a clinical case of depression and is well advised to seek medical advice about what to do about. Both medicine and cognitive talk therapy can be helpful, often most helpful as a both-and combination.",1254752443

861808,comment,861747,861747,0,0,sanj,,,"The news about Dan has had this question kicking through my head for a day and night, primarily because I've never considered suicide, though I suspect I've been through a depressive bout when my life took an unexpected turn for much worse.<p>The primary consideration I've identified is that when both my professional personal lives suddenly fell apart, I had a young son to take care of.  Hopping in a car and driving across the country wasn't an option, much less something more permanent.  I had a serious, nontransferable responsibility that kept me grounded and kept things in perspective.<p>The destruction of my life was exacerbated by the fact that much of my sense of self, purpose, and self worth was tied up in the company I was working for.  My days were there, my evenings often involved colleagues who'd grown into friends and my brain's idle cycles were spent working on making it successful.<p>I also had a responsibility to my company and the people that I worked with.  It was clear to me that leaving -- in any sense -- could result in the majority of the talented technical staff leaving.  And after that the company would collapse.  The people had families, mortgages, kids in college.  Leaving and causing them that unwarranted pain, stress and upheaval wasn't something I wanted on my conscience.<p>I ended up staying, finishing building and selling the product I'd started, and leaving just as it took off.  Last year (several years after I left), it represented 70% of the revenues of the firm.  I left with my head held high.<p>My conclusion is that having these ties to the individuals in the firm and to my kid allowed me to consider my life in a larger matrix: entwined and linked to others.  The thought of ripping myself out of that matrix by ending my life was anathema.<p>I wonder if the focus of the startup world on young, unattached, ""unencumbered"" founders is a mistake.  These people may be most susceptible to <i>not</i> being part of a larger matrix and most at risk because they don't have the perspective that time can provide.<p>Note that I'm not suggesting that the young/unencumbered/unattached may not be successful, just that they may not be the best equipped to handle some of the rigors of this life.",1254751842

I think it's a good idea to explain that, since from the command line you are basically calling functions inside the fabfile.py, this allows you to define different environments. Something like:<p>def env1():\n    env.some_property = 'hehe'<p>def env2():\n    env.some_property = 'haha'<p>def deploy():\n    put('/%s/file.prop', '/somewhere_in_the_server/')<p>If you then run 'fab env1 deploy' you will copy the file under 'hehe' to the server. If you use env2 you will copy the other one. You are basically overriding the env variable. You can do the same to configure different paths for different target servers.<p>Really cool stuff :D",1254751778

They are clearly unplanned and seem to have been executed at the spur of the moment.<p>Given that it seems clear to me that some overwhelming feeling of dread comes over people in that one instant that has such a profound impact on them that they desperately need to stop it by any means necessary.  Faced with that reality you'd be a fool not to wonder if the same thing could happen to you.  Since you can't really answer that it makes sense to try to prepare yourself for the eventuality while you're in a rational state of mind.<p>So in that respect I've thought about it.",1254751626

I know that its wrong, because I never debugged it. I just rewrote the whole thing in Ruby without any investigation. Maybe I was wrong,maybe my code was buggy or my project just didnt deserve and A+ (my teacher never gave me any reason for the minus in my grade). I just needed something to blame my crashed project on. Call it escapism and you are right actually. But still when you put something in your mind, a sheer hate for a thing when you are just 13 or 14 you tend to hate it forever. May be thats the case with me. May be it isnt and I am just too stubborn. Maybe I will just learn clojure after my term paper is submitted and then will write a post. Now what I wanna see is what I write in that post",1254751316

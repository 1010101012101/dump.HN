I mean, ""To increase the randomness of our hash outputs...combines the password with the account name,"" so now I know they use an account name so what is the point in that tiny part?  Many little parts of this just give away stuff that should be secret in my opinion.  That doesn't necessarily make it insecure, just a dumb idea if something ever did go wrong.  Overall the process sounds good if you just want to store data on their server and not have it be readable if someone happens to come across a ""dead"" HDD that lavabit threw away.<p>Oh, on a similar note: how do they decrypt these messages after you have verified your user/password during sign in if it requires the plaintext password to decrypt each message?  By storing the password in a plaintext session database?",1266040577

1122591,comment,1122402,1122402,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> The largest observed difference in support for spending was between the traditional category ""welfare"" and the two variant forms ""assistance for the poor"" and ""caring for the poor.""<p>It's the same reason unpleasant jobs have the name of the job changed every 10 to 20 years. Janitorial services, custodial services, sanitation technian, etc... in the beginning, it avoids the stigma of what it is - cleaning up dirt/filth/etc. Over time, people catch up, and you have to change the name of it again. Arguably ""Secretary"" to ""Executive Assistant"" is the same thing.<p>Welfare works similarly - when it's rebranded, it does well for a while, then sinks back down into unpopularity. When someone says ""social safety net"" these days it tends to evoke a more favorable response, but they usually don't mean anything significantly different from general welfare, unemployment, and other state-provided assistance. But a social safety net doesn't have the same associations with welfare, so it's more favorable right now. If social safety net acquires the same connotations as welfare, the name will be changed again in 10-20 years.",1266037999

I know it's not polite to toot your own horn but I would have said this about HotChime regardless of who wrote it.

If it has a space character in it, it will Google it. Otherwise, it will launch default browser to www.[whatyoutyped].com. If you have predefined [whatyoutyped] to something else, it will open that (website, file, folder). I have HN mapped to 'h', Slashdot mapped to '/.' (literally) and my local weather to 'w'. You can also setup custom %s searches for F1-F5 key. I have F2 = Wikipedia (mapped to chir.ag/wiki/%s e.g. <a href=""http://chir.ag/wiki/hacker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chir.ag/wiki/hacker</a> ), F3 = Dictionary, F4 = Thesaurus, F5 = PHP manual.<p>It's not that useful for average users but for powerusers/keyboard-types, it works great. Also, it's a single 37kb exe, no install/uninstall. Do realize that I wrote this in 2003, long before every browser had a search box and before Google had maps/local-searching.

1122577,comment,1119992,1119992,0,0,Catenacci,,,"I'd bet you're maintaining legacy C++ code.  If so, while it's good to look at good C++ code (like Boost and the materials you can find on the C++ FAQ) chances are you're going to run into some fairly gnarly code--especially if code has been maintained over several years by several developers.  Having maintained C++ legacy code in a commercial app for the last 5 or 6 years--I wish I had some good advice to share.  There are a few things:<p>1.) May sound obvious but good version control is essential.  A seemingly innocent change can have nasty side effects.  You need to be able to revert to a known to be good state easily.<p>2.) Watch out for side effects.  If something looks odd it may be because there was some very valid reason for the odd construct.   Some of the developers working on this commercial app decided to add a copy constructor to a class which never had it before.  Ironically, when they added a copy constructor, it trounced all over some bitwise copying code that had been hacked in years before.  Hence they had to go back to an older version to straighten things out (see point 1 above).<p>3.) Add intermediate variables to help yourself understand the code.  You'll probably see constructs like this:<p>func1()->func2()->func3();<p>This means that func1 returns a pointer which is then used to get func2 which returns a pointer which is then used to invoke func3.  This is horrid code but it seems to be a very common antipattern in C++ code (at least in my experience).  Adding variables to hold intermediate pointers can help a lot in understanding what the code is doing and in checking to insure that you're testing for bad pointers.<p>Those are just some thoughts off the top of my head.",1266037249

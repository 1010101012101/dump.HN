4923927,comment,4920831,4922147,10,0,dalke,,,"I was developing CGI programs in the 1990s. Some of my code was in cgi-lib.pl, which was the first widely popular CGI library. I can say that people knew about the problems of trusting arbitrary user input.<p>Lincoln Stein, who wrote the CGI.pm (the second widely popular CGI library), also wrote ""Web Security: A Step-by-Step Reference Guide"", published in 1998, which was two years after he started the ""World Wide Web Security FAQ"". Here's the 1998 archive of the FAQ: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19980213181713/http://www13.w3.org/Security/faq/www-security-faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/19980213181713/http://www13.w3.or...</a><p>SQL wasn't that widely used in the early- to mid-1990s. While some places used it, I don't think they went mainstream until Philip Greenspun's ""Database Backed Web Sites: the thinking person's guide to web publishing"" in 1997. So early SQL injection examples are hard to point out.<p>But shell injection examples are a dime a dozen. Here's a posting from 1995 outlining the strategy for dealing with CGI input: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.providers/msg/cec253d29c0e5c1b?dmode=source"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.provider...</a><p>> The entire philosophy can be summed up as ""Never trust input data."" Most security holes are exploited by  sending data to the script that the author of the script did not anticipate.<p>along with examples with the system() command:<p><pre><code>    Perl:\n        system(""/usr/lib/sendmail -t $foo_address < $input_file"");\n\n    C: \n        sprintf(buffer, ""/usr/lib/sendmail -t %s < %s"", foo_address, input_file);\n        system(buffer);\n\n    C++:\n        system(""/usr/lib/sendmail -t "" + FooAddress + "" < "" + InputFile);\n</code></pre>\nplus variations through Perl's pipe, backtick, exec, and eval commands, and C's popen().<p>It even mentions that using a<p><pre><code>    open(MAIL, ""/usr/lib/sendmail -t"")\n    print MAIL ""To: $recipient\n"";\n</code></pre>\ndoesn't go through the shell but does pass data unchecked to sendmail, so the one should make sure the code cannot be tricked.<p>If you did HTTP in the early 1990s then you very likely used NCSA's httpd. The security page for httpd, from 1998, is still available from archive.org: <a href=""http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/security.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/security.html</a> .<p>> A well-behaved client will escape any characters which have special meaning to the Bourne shell in a query string and thus avoid problems with your script misinterpreting the characters. A mischevious client may use special characters to confuse your script and gain unauthorized access.<p>Replace ""Bourne shell"" with ""SQL"" and you have a SQL injection attack.<p>You wrote: ""However, at the time, the collective understanding of security issues was much lower.""<p>I think you underestimate the collective understanding of 15 years ago and overestimate the collective understanding of now. I've seen a bunch of code written in the last few years (mostly for internal use, by non-professional programmers) which still which sends arbitrary user commands to system() and to SQL.",1355528010

There are lots of time I've found a shell to be useful, but I've also changed my workflow to minimize the amount of time I spend there. Learning curve for shell is steep, not shallow, but I've gone through much of that 20 years ago. If there is an old tool I can use to do something, I'm all for it, but if its a new tool, I'll go for the visual one with the lower learning curve, because I'm quite busy. Still, nothing beats shell for composability and flexibility, I definitely lose something with my approach. I find lots of promise in projects like Mozilla's Ubiquity, but I have a feeling the next step are actually Siri-like dialogue systems (whether typed or spoken).<p>But we are talking about editors that are used to edit code. I'll argue that language aware editors (in Eclipse, Idea, VS) have already greatly surpassed VIM/Emacs in terms of productivity, but then you could argue back that VIM/Emacs could re-support these features (and people have crammed them in at some points, though these have failed to stick). So let's just assume equal footing for now, and evaluate the experience. Given that we have a good understanding of the development process now, I'll argue that an IDE with high-discoverability of its capabilities is easier to use than Emacs/VIM which require substantial training to master. Now what Emacs/VIM give you is lots of power, but I don't think most of us need that. Heck, I've even moved away from Emacs for Latex programming, where the ""build project/view PDF"" menu option in TeXniCenter is good enough for me.",1355527868

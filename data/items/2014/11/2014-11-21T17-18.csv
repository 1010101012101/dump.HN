You&#x27;ve confounded a positive argument with a normative one.<p>Either way: it clearly is entitlement. Someone writes something, conjuring something new out of thin air. An unrelated person believes they have a moral claim to that thing. QED.<p>I do happen to think this entitlement is negative, if for no other reason than that it prevents people from publishing or even talking about publishing for fear of having to deal with entitled strangers arguing with them about what to do with their work.

They are not opposite spin, they are entangled! Their spin is undefined until measured even though they are perfectly anticorrelated, as you mention.<p>Here&#x27;s another way to frame this:<p>Composite systems can exhibit entanglement. The Hilbert space such systems live in (H) is the tensor product of the individual component Hilbert spaces (H1, H2). Now the most general state in H is a linear combination &sum; c_ij |i>_1 &#8855; |j>_2 where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the component Hilbert spaces. Some of these superpositions are not separable into tensor products of states from each component space H1 and H2. One such superposition is (omitting c_ij) |00> + |11>, as you can see it is not separable. The state |01> + |11> on the other hand can be separated as (|0> + |1>)&#8855;|1>. An entangled state is an inseparable state.<p>So the point is that classical analogies are not to be used when dealing with quantum mechanics.

8642329,comment,8642264,8642264,0,0,enkiv2,,,"Lua makes for an ideal language to embed in a larger project. Structurally, it&#x27;s like python, but it&#x27;s smaller and more internally consistent (without the large standard library), faster, and has a nicer C API.<p>Because Lua is an academic project, it has different pressures than a primarily practical project like python or perl. The Lua source code fits on a floppy disk, is pure C, and is clear and well-written.<p>As for what&#x27;s (arguably) bad about Lua:<p>1) it doesn&#x27;t have nearly as large a community as other similar languages, and what community it does have is in many cases split up between software packages that use it as an extension language or a configuration language. The config files for awesome and for ion are written in Lua, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you can take the configuration for one and port it to the other. Likewise, WoW and photoshop both make use of Lua for scripting. I get the impression that a lot of people who use Lua don&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s a general purpose language and an independent project.<p>2) It lacks a strong standard library, and many really common things (like sockets) aren&#x27;t built in. Until version 5.1, importing installed packages wasn&#x27;t even a completely standard part of the language. More complicated packages often exist but are fairly obscure, and there&#x27;s no gem/npm/pip style system for pulling packages down automatically or managing their dependencies.<p>3) There are some odd limitations here and there. In 2007 I was working on a project in Lua that took advantage of a single very large table -- and learned that there was at that time a limit of 2^13 string keys. I think that limit has since grown, but it&#x27;s unusual for a scripting language to have such a low limit for anything (aside from recursion depth).",1416591862

He talks about Smash being &quot;unbalanced&quot;, and then immediately explains that it&#x27;s a console game which has never been patched. He then follows up by contrasting it with LoL, and the constant state of patching that LoL exists in. Treating &quot;balance&quot; as a verb, rather than an adjective.

The real answer is more complicated. For example:<p>Red Hat is on board because they pay its creator&#x27;s salary. So they rely on an individual bias.<p>Debian is on board because they rely upon &#x27;collective wisdom&#x27; and committees to make decisions. So they rely on the bias of group thinking.<p>Ubuntu is on board because Debian is on board. So they rely on the bias of the other.<p>Other distributions are using it because &#x27;every other distribution is using it&#x27;, or they&#x27;re small enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause conflicts for its use base, or because it&#x27;s a GNOME dependency, or because it&#x27;s just new technology.<p>--<p>To make someone think something is a good idea, show them someone else thinks it&#x27;s a good idea. This is a fact of all human beings&#x27; thought processes. Decisions are not based on merit, or logic, or even a quorum; it is based on fallacies created by heuristics. There exists a heuristic in which the more an idea is adopted, the more other people think it is a good idea.<p>We <i>imagine</i> our thoughts are logical, and that other people also think logically, and that their decisions must be made for a good reason. But in fact, the great majority of all decisions we make are based on guesses; this is how our brains are able to carry out complex calculations and come to decisions in split-seconds.<p>For example, you might look at systemd and say, &quot;it fixes so many problems! it provides so many features! it standardizes Linux! CLEARLY this is superior. we must adopt it.&quot;<p>For people who care about the purity of the highest technical ideals, this makes sense. For people who care about being able to use their computer, these things don&#x27;t matter, and in the systemd implementation, actually makes things worse for them. The changes systemd purports to make are not bad things. It&#x27;s really just the way in which they did it that is bad.<p>--<p>It&#x27;s like wanting to upgrade your bicycle to four wheels, but requiring the rider now operate it lying flat down and using mirrors to navigate. The four wheels was a great idea. Using mirrors to navigate? Maybe not so great.<p>Of course, its creators will turn this inconvenience into a feature, saying &quot;you get to lay down! it&#x27;s therefore more efficient and easier to use!&quot;, completely ignoring how other people want to ride a 4-wheeler.",1416591122

In Maslo&#x27;s Hierarchy of Programming you can get by with first class functions and an AST module just fine. But it is a fine day when you can generate code using the same primitives you would use on plain old data.<p>It&#x27;s not the most interesting example of macros but it does illustrate one small point: we can use <i>yield-from</i> in an expression as if it were any other symbol in the language. This is what Lispers mean when they say that you can program the language with macros. They&#x27;re mini-compilers. It&#x27;s when you start layering them together that things start to get interesting. You can use the <i>yield-from</i> symbol in any valid place within an expression... and since Hy is all expressions and has no statements it gets expanded out and put in the right place and just works.<p>In languages without macros you have design patterns. The lack of facility for linguistic abstraction forces us to use primitives to describe more sophisticated phenomenon than our language provides by default. So Twisted has had sub-generators in Python 2 for a while and they work rather well via its Deferred abstraction. It works well and I was glad to have it... however its implementation is much more complex than the macro described in this blog post. We had to wait for Python 3 to have them integrated into the language. Macros can bypass that which is the point the OP was trying to make.<p>The point I&#x27;m making here is that you can do pretty much everything you want to do without macros. You&#x27;ll just have to write quite a bit more code and come up with many more metaphors and analogies in order to get it to work. Macros just let you get straight to the point by extending the language.",1416590507

As for sync&#x27;ing, I found the following to be a huge boon for users:<p>- Allow the user to set sync to happen only when connected via Wi-Fi (not sure if this is possible in iOS, but it&#x27;s easy to check how an Android device is connected to the Internet).<p>- Give options for sync intervals. Most of our users choose once a day. Other options include sync&#x27;ing a call or text right after it&#x27;s finished or received if they need their data to be up-to-date within minutes.",1416590359

From what I understand, and I&#x27;m sure I am wrong, a transducer receives and transforms a value, and may call the next transducer with the transformed value.<p>The nice thing is that a transducer does not create intermediate results (a seq/enumerable), and that it doesn&#x27;t make any assumptions on the underlying datastructure. So you can, for instance, send a value through a transducer and directly place it in a list, instead of creating a set of enumerables and then call .ToList on that. Since transducers can work with any value, you also aren&#x27;t tied to enumerables. So transducers should be a little more universal and performant than enumerables.",1416589547

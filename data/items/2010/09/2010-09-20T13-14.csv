And which hosting solution then? The main alternatives seem to be colocating and VPS, but each have significant pros and cons (especially for poor students like me).<p>Colocating, pros:
 - Resources are cheap (sticking in a few hundred GB of disk space costs next to nothing)
 - Full control over the hardware and OS<p>Colocating, cons:
 - High up-front cost (server and for a lot of colocating deals set-up cost)
 - Your problem when stuff breaks
 - Not always accessible 24/7 (especially cheaper hosting)<p>VPS, pros:
 - No costs upfront
 - No worrying about hardware failure
 - More common/low budget hosting<p>VPS, cons:
 - Less control over OS (for example mostly linux based, FreeBSD hosts seem few and far between)
 - Low cost version usually have very little memory/disk space limits<p>Now I guess you could say ""Just learn linux then!"" to take 1 VPS con away, but I just don't feel comfortable working on linux machines.

The amazing part about start-ups is that they make me feel truly alive and independent, while working for someone else makes me feel trapped and dependent.  Right now, I'm really happy.<p>I'm also looking forward to the next part of our start-ups growth, which staying with the analogy, will be like growing a clan of like minded people who want to build on what we started.<p>Also, I read once in 'Stumbling on Happiness' that people are happy when they can actually have an impact on things.  In less than a year, we have already significantly impacted the YouTube space and will be continually impacting the entertainment industry.

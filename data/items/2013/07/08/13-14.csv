I have thankfully just had a few customers who expected me to always be available, and to turn things around on very short notice, all the time.<p>The issue is fairness to all customers and except for emergencies allocate large blocks of time, in advance, to each customer and don&#x27;t interrupt thinking time for one customer by talking to another. In other words, if you are like me and like to work in intense 1 to 2 hour sprints without interruptions, customers who hire me should understand that it might take a few hours to get back to them for non-emergencies.<p>One sign of a good customer: when they know they are going to have a crunch and ask if they can pay extra for getting &quot;always on&quot; service for a while.",1373291995

However, I find myself very hesitant to pay with my email for a &#x27;free&#x27; signup unless I know what it is. Even with the examples, I have no idea what a &#x27;premortem&#x27; is or what form that takes in your app; its value is still a complete unknown to me even after visiting your site and blog.<p>I don&#x27;t see any unique value proposition that offers me value. For those who understand what a &#x27;premortem&#x27; is they might find it valuable but I cannot even begin to understand it nor do I find it necessary to invest time enough to find out because I don&#x27;t understand its value. In the words of Clayton Christensen, what job is it accomplishing? When I walk by a restaurant that is new, I have no idea what the food might taste like but at least I know what value food offers. In this case, I don&#x27;t even understand the value that &#x27;premortems&#x27; offer.<p>So, I would offer the following suggestions:<p>1. Give a clear, one line explanation of what can be achieved with a &#x27;premortem&#x27; (i.e. what job is getting done; more successful projects doesn&#x27;t count as a tagline because it gives no explanation of what that means. You set X = &#x27;Premortem&#x27; and Y = &#x27;Successful project&#x27; but there is no explanation given of the correlation between X and Y.)<p>2. Give a clear demonstration of that being achieved with an example &#x27;premortem&#x27; (i.e. how the job is done with your site)<p>3. Show pictures/screenshots of that being done (There is currently too much reading to be done on the site)<p>Once again the name is interesting enough to get me to write this explanation. Thus, there is at least minimal value in the name. I&#x27;m intrigued but purely by curiosity. The curiosity is simply a vessel waiting to be filled in order to create value.",1373291721

6006730,comment,6005119,6005467,1,0,_mulder_,,,"Maximum bandwidth all depends on the technology used. If we&#x27;re talking 802.11n using MIMO (Multiple Tx and Rx antennas/spatial streams) then we could theoretically expect 600mbps. However, even if we&#x27;re using top quality kit, today&#x27;s speeds are more like 150mbps to 300mbps.<p>See... <a href=""http://www.ruckuswireless.com/products/zoneflex-outdoor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruckuswireless.com/products/zoneflex-outdoor</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009</a><p>However, the problem with a mesh, particularly WiFi, comes from the size of the broadcast domain, or the service area footprint and, more specifically, the frequency channels.<p>If you operate a mesh where single access points mesh with their direct neighbours, then that 300mbps is shared over all the AP&#x27;s and the bandwidth reduces dramatically, especially if it&#x27;s a dense deployment where noise from one transmitter can be easily picked up by multiple receivers.<p>One way around this is to copy what cell carriers do and... create some cells. A cell is a part of a larger network but it operates on a different channel to it&#x27;s neighbours, so that 300mb is just for that AP, it&#x27;s subscribers, and a select, but small, number of neighbour AP&#x27;s.<p>The problem with this is you then need two radios (two AP&#x27;s), connected via Ethernet cable, to operate on two channels. I.e. One radio looks left on channel 1, the other radio looks right on channel 11. This way you get frequency re-use and can get much closer to that full channel capacity, but at the cost of doubling the infrastructure cost.",1373291529

Not to get all tin-foily, but I would assume that any undertaking that ambitious would have government agents working from the inside.<p>If you&#x27;re transmitting any data that could be illegal, your safest bet is to use some kind of encryption that would take longer than the statute of limitations for whichever crime you&#x27;re committing to break (you&#x27;d probably also have to factor Moore&#x27;s law into your calculation and pray that quantum computing doesn&#x27;t become viable in the next x years).",1373291312

Unemployment is left-over apples that you don&#x27;t sell.<p>I understand that with a bunch more money floating around, the price of your apples will increase. That&#x27;s basic inflation. But what you&#x27;re saying is that not only will the price increase, but it will increase so much that you will end up with a lot of leftover apples you can&#x27;t sell.<p>But why? The price isn&#x27;t set by magic, it&#x27;s set by <i>you</i>. You&#x27;ll make the most money if you can sell more or less all of your apples, so you&#x27;ll set a price that results in people buying them all. That price will likely be higher than it would be in the world without a basic income, but you&#x27;re still going to sell all of your apples. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll lower your price until you do.<p>I don&#x27;t see why labor would be any different. Yes, prices (wages) probably get pushed up there. But where&#x27;s the pressure to push prices up to the extent that a large number of people can&#x27;t find jobs? Just like the apple-seller, people make more money when they set a price where they actually find work. If a lot of people are out of work at $X/hour, then those people will generally accept wages at $(X-1)/hour, or less, until they all manage to find jobs. The minimum wage puts a floor on this, but I don&#x27;t see how the basic income does.<p>I can see an increase in <i>voluntary</i> joblessness, where people&#x27;s labor can only produce a small amount of value, and they don&#x27;t see the point in working for that small amount of value when they can stay at home and watch TV and survive on their basic income.

For instance, most ruby database drivers used to be broken in this way with respect to multi-threading, but were fixed to be &quot;non-blocking IO&quot;, so threads would actually be unscheduled (even in MRI) when waiting on IO.<p>For examples of this use of &quot;blocking IO&quot; vs &quot;non-blocking IO&quot; see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O</a>    (Ha, look what wikipedia URL did to &quot;I/O&quot;).<p>That usage is pretty common, so I think your different use of &#x27;blocking IO&#x27; is confusing.",1373289311

And for an accident scenario, I think it&#x27;s completely impossible today since we would need to integrate audio, video and smell sensors and AI software to rival humans in situational awareness. This would mean exceptionally complex software.<p>The way we have solved reliability in autopilots and FBW systems today is to make them as simple as possible and to give them sensible fallback modes (like the Airbus FBW removing stall protection when missing certain inputs), and even then we have had real life accidents because of programming errors or design errors. So if you think pilot automation is mainly a question of politics as you said earlier, I think you are being overly optimistic (which, of couse, is not uncommon in the software industry).<p>I think a better approach to removing pilots is to see the strengths in both computers and humans and design systems where the advantages of both are maximized.<p>If you are interested in reading more on software safety, <a href=""http://sunnyday.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sunnyday.mit.edu/</a> is a good starting point.",1373289279

Also true with things like transit infrastructure: even though a modern subway or elevated train line, like the Copenhagen metro (which has both), is better in just about every way from the old style of construction, it subjectively doesn&#x27;t have the same impressive feel of something like the NYC subway or Chicago El, with their massive steel columns and hundreds of thousands of rivets.",1373288627

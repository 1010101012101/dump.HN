If you walk into any financial planner's office and tell them you're in your 20's, they will set up your investment portfolio to be almost 100% stocks.  They will then tell you that as you get older, they will scale back the % held in stocks and replace it with bonds (which are safer).  As you near retirement, your portfolio will mostly be bonds/other safe vehicles, and very small % of stocks.",1278449992

After all, most major point of sale systems do use relational databases to store and track menu items. The menu item databases are usually highly configurable but I've usually seen them break down into:<p>1) Major categories: Entrees, Appetizers
2) Menu items: Cheeseburger, Grilled Salmon
3) Modifier categories: Steak Temperature, Salad Dressing
4) Modifiers: Rare, Medium, Well-Done, etc.<p>Of course you usually don't display the modifiers on the menu itself, that is a back end implementation detail. :)",1278449936

Insignificant? I would be out-of-my-mind ecstatic at 20% returns. 20% of $20000 is $4000, which is (for most young adults) equivalent to several months of wages.<p>However, it's also dishonest to imply that 20% is at all realistic. 3-4% per year is more likely over the long term, and most young adults will see better returns from using the $20000 to pay off credit cards or student loans.

What uncertainty? I don't care how much my stocks are worth today or tomorrow, because I don't plan to sell them for years (or decades). Some prudence is wise (such as not buying at the top of a bubble), but the only people I've seen get stressed out about the market are usually 1) invested in some dodgy get-rich-quick scheme or 2) planning to retire in a year or two.<p><pre><code>  > Someone in their twenties should focus on their education

None of these require $20000, unless ""taking classes"" means ""attending Harvard"" or ""networking events"" means ""week-long drug-fueled orgies"".<p><pre><code>  > It is also not a bad idea to have $20,000 cash in the

$1000? Definitely. $2000? OK, if you live in an expensive area. $20000? Waste of capital. Savings accounts have very low interest rates right now -- better to have your money working for you than being slowly eroded via inflation.<p>The best time to buy into a market is when the crazies are out in force.

1492300,comment,1489867,1489867,0,0,alsomike,,,"I have been studying continental philosophy for a few years now, mostly Kant, Hegel, Lacan and Heidegger. I think it's extremely interesting and rewarding and I recommend it to anyone who doesn't feel intellectually challenged. I read a book about Maurice Merleau-Ponty that included excerpts of his writing in both English and French, and I thought that the French was much clearer, even with my limited knowledge of the language, and it made me want to improve my French and learn German so that I can better understand what they're saying.<p>So foreign language is another barrier to entry that hasn't been mentioned yet. There are English translations, but often they aren't very good. My process for engaging with a philosopher is an iterative, multi-pass process - I start with several introductory texts or a biography before (very slowly) tackling a main text. At that point, I usually have a good idea about where the argument is going, but only a thin grasp of how we got there, so I go through the material once or twice more. This is complicated by the fact that these ideas don't stand on their own, they are part of a tradition, and it's not really possible to take one thinker and find out what he or she thinks, because it's filled with references to others. It's just not possible to pick up a main text and read it in a weekend and expect to get anything out of it - it's more like a lifetime project, something you'd add to a ""Things to accomplish before I die"" list. If ""Learn French or German"" is on there too, you have a head start.<p>One practical benefit is that reading a difficult text is like running with weights on. It feels like you're flying when you read something easier. And if you're looking for critiques or refutations of postmodernism specifically, continental philosophy is much more interesting than this link. Ironically, it's somewhat self-refuting, since in trying to critique the postmodernists, it unknowingly adopts an important (although distorted) postmodern point: the role of discourse in the production of power and authority. Although, of course, the author uses this to assert the superiority of his preferred rationalist, technocratic regime of truth. In other words, the claim is that postmodernism is an imposter, a bullshit pretender to the throne that Engineering should rightfully occupy. Postmodernists, under the influence of Derrida and Foucault, would say that this claim is ""logocentric"", a code word which ultimately means patriarchal, racist, colonialist, homophobic, etc. The demand that ""postmodernism"" present itself as a single well-defined and unified idea would also be seen in this light, which is probably why no postmodernists are here to defend themselves. To them, it's boringly obvious that software engineering is philosophically rooted in patriarchy.",1278448872

This sounds like it's simply conjecture or personal experience at best... in which case I'll mention that I know plenty of non-gamer professionals who respect gamers. Even if it is stigmatized, it's becoming decreasingly so as older gamer generations age. And the widespread immaturity made possible by total anonymity is a big reason people don't respect the gaming community in the first place. I welcome changes like this, which only serve to accelerate the de-stigmatization of gaming.<p><i>>> lots of users will stop playing these games for professional reasons</i><p>Why would someone who wishes to remain anonymous stop playing a game, when they can instead simply stop posting on the forums?<p><i>>> They don't understand how much they're giving up people's privacy</i><p>The ""invasion of privacy"" flag is waved nauseatingly often. It is <i>not</i> an invasion of privacy for a site to <i>allow</i> you to intentionally make posts under your real name.

That's why relatively crappy inventions can take root.<p>For instance, PCs were not good compared to mainframes or workstations, but they were bought by people <i>that weren't buying workstations</i>.  This gave them the chance to build businesses and improve until they <i>could</i> later compete with, and displace workstations.<p>For Tesla, what is the disruptive market?  I'm not sure.  Their cars do the same things as other cars, with different inputs.  If their ""disruptive"" niche is to be an eco-fashion symbol, and that gives them time to build a car whose TCO is 20+% less because of the difference in fuel cost per mile, then they have a shot.<p>For what could truly be disruptive to personal transportation is Better Place ( <a href=""http://www.wired.com/cars/futuretransport/magazine/16-09/ff_agassi?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/cars/futuretransport/magazine/16-09/ff_...</a> ).

If another business offering the same type of product suddenly opens up, those customers are not going to stay loyal unless they're happy with your business.

1492234,comment,1491623,1492016,0,0,lkrubner,,,"Leaving money on the table during an IPO is often attacked as a form of fraud. I recall it was a big issue during the peak of the Internet boom, 1997-2000. There you had a lot of startups desperate for money to fund their growth, and yet they gave away substantial amounts of money to speculators. There were clear abuses of ""Friends and Family"" blocks of stock -- these started getting handed out to anyone who could move the deal forward, with the understanding that the stock could be dumped on the opening day of trading. This amounted to a kind of bribe, an additional payment made in excess of all the normal IPO fees.<p>Wikipedia offers this:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering</a><p>""The underpricing of initial public offerings (IPO) has been well documented in different markets (Ibbotson, 1975; Ritter 1984; Levis, 1990; McGuinness, 1992). While Issuers always try to maximize their issue proceeds, the underpricing of IPOs has constituted a serious anomaly in the literature of financial economics. Many financial economists have developed different models to explain the underpricing of IPOs. Some of the models explained it as a consequences of deliberate underpricing by issuers or their agents. In general, smaller issues are observed to be underpriced more than large issues (Ritter, 1984, Ritter, 1991, Levis, 1990) Historically, IPOs both globally and in the United States have been underpriced. The effect of ""initial underpricing"" an IPO is to generate additional interest in the stock when it first becomes publicly traded. Through flipping, this can lead to significant gains for investors who have been allocated shares of the IPO at the offering price. However, underpricing an IPO results in ""money left on the table""—lost capital that could have been raised for the company had the stock been offered at a higher price. One great example of all these factors at play was seen with theglobe.com IPO which helped fuel the IPO mania of the late 90's internet era. Underwritten by Bear Stearns on November 13, 1998 the stock had been priced at $9 per share, and famously jumped 1000% at the opening of trading all the way up to $97, before deflating and closing at $63 after large sell offs from institutions flipping the stock . Although the company did raise about $30 million from the offering it is estimated that with the level of demand for the offering and the volume of trading that took place the company might have left upwards of $200 million on the table.""<p>All the same, Wikipedia also offers a charitable explanation for the phenomena:<p>""The danger of overpricing is also an important consideration. If a stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will pay, the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to sell shares. Even if they sell all of the issued shares, if the stock falls in value on the first day of trading, it may lose its marketability and hence even more of its value.""",1278447716

Many of them are done in Flash, and don't work at all on most phones. Others force you to download PDF menus which take forever to load and have an annoying tendency to lock up my phone.<p>The irony, of course, is that I'm <i>most</i> likely to be looking at restaurant websites on my phone, when I'm around town looking for an interesting place to eat. There's nothing more frustrating than pulling up a restaurant website, only to see a Flash page that doesn't work, or a desktop website that you have to pinch, zoom, and scroll your way around.<p>I built ChompStack to make it easier for restaurants to create mobile friendly versions of their websites.<p>Any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated.<p>I feel like our biggest challenge with this service is getting in touch with restaurant owners and convincing them of the value of having a mobile website, most of them don't seem to be particularly interested in technology.",1278446660

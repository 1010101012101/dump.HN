6112085,comment,6111816,6111816,14,0,rndmize,,,"> &quot;Having a scholar teach and engage his or her own students in person is far superior to having those students watch a video of another scholar engaging his or her own students,&quot; the professors wrote.<p>I beg to differ. Lecturing has been demonstrated to be a flatly terrible method of instruction/learning, and I see minimal difference between watching a professor 50 feet away versus on a screen. When the educational method is so poor that a minimal number of students learn anything from it they couldn&#x27;t learn studying textbooks on their own, digitizing it can hardly make it much worse.<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/2012/01/01/144550920/physicists-seek-to-lose-the-lecture-as-teaching-tool"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2012/01/01/144550920/physicists-seek-to-l...</a><p>This article illustrates the flaws with lecturing and, by proxy, with the current efforts made by MOOCs, Khan Academy, and so on. Ironically, this is not new information. People like Maria Montessori developed teaching methods more than a hundred years ago by studying children and constructing tools, classrooms and methods of instruction around how they learned.<p>From the linked article -<p>> Mazur&#x27;s physics class is now different. Rather than lecturing, he makes his students do most of the talking.<p>> At a recent class, the students  nearly 100 of them  are in small groups discussing a question. Three possible answers to the question are projected on a screen. Before the students start talking with one another, they use a mobile device to vote for their answer. Only 29 percent got it right. After talking for a few minutes, Mazur tells them to answer the question again.<p>> This time, 62 percent of the students get the question right. Next, Mazur leads a discussion about the reasoning behind the answer. The process then begins again with a new question. This is a method Mazur calls &quot;peer Instruction.&quot; He now teaches all of his classes this way.<p>> &quot;What we found over now close to 20 years of using this approach is that the learning gains at the end of the semester nearly triple,&quot; he says.<p>Maria Montessori recommended teaching children in age groups of 3 years at a time (3-6 year olds in one classroom, 7-9 in another, etc.) The final stage of learning material is when you can teach it to others, and requires a greater mastery; hence, a classroom that spans ages/grades provides opportunities for older students to instruct younger ones and strengthen their own knowledge of the material.<p>This is effectively what Mazur has rediscovered and applied; by having students debate among themselves, the ones that are correct and hence, have a better understanding of the material, can explain to the others their reasoning behind their choice, as well as improving their grasp by having to defend against questions from the others.<p>Montessori also developed a wide variety of tools and &quot;works&quot; for students to use, allowing for a kinesthetic learning experience (something I would consider vastly more effective than lecture or video at younger ages, and of continuing importance even through college) - note that when Mazur&#x27;s students largely got the question concerning gravity wrong, even after learning the mechanics of it in lecture, he resorted to practical demonstrations. There are few better examples of this than the Binomial Cube, which is introduced in Montessori preschools(!)<p><a href=""http://www.montessoriworld.org/sensory/sbinoml.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.montessoriworld.org/sensory/sbinoml.html</a><p>Preschool students are not expected to understand the math behind the cube, which is after all algebra, but the work is meant to prime them for when they do encounter it several years down the line, as well as providing a physical construct that the math can be related back to at that point.<p>Which brings me to my final point: rather than trying to move traditional, ineffective methods of instruction online, edtech really should be aiming to maximize the learning capabilities of computers, which can allow things and methods of learning that simply aren&#x27;t possible in the physical world. For example, the binomial cube, as good as it is, is still a fairly complex concept; a computer representation of it could extend it by allowing a student to reshape pieces in a 3D space, or provide values for the x, y and z variables and see how the cube transforms. This would allow for an even more powerful and intuitive understanding of how the pieces, sides and full cube relate to the binomial equation; and its manipulation that you could only do in a virtual environment.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t really expect this to happen any time soon. Newspapers are still being dragged kicking and screaming into the digital age; I&#x27;d guess genuinely effective new teaching methods will similarly take years to come together. (It might be useful to start by discarding the concept of a &quot;class&quot; and look to MMOs for inspiration - material created for people at a variety of levels of understanding, with no real required time frame, where students can form groups to tackle difficult concepts/projects, or mentor others...)",1374907537

6112083,comment,6111727,6112058,4,0,kyzyl,,,"I&#x27;m curious... is the matlabbing that happens at your work related to the simulink/realtime/control parts of matlab? Based on the other things you&#x27;ve said it sounds to me like that might be the case. Obviously I might be wrong.<p>In any case, I&#x27;ve found that those parts of matlab can actually be used pretty effectively. I think the reason is that, even though matlab as a language is pretty crappy (IMO), these domains aren&#x27;t actually dominated by programming languages. Take for example industrial control. It&#x27;s extremely common to use PLC&#x27;s, PAC&#x27;s or FPGAs. These tools are, like simulink, largely operated via proprietary graphical environments.<p>Essentially, I agree with your points for uses of matlab where you don&#x27;t write much custom code, and/or where your custom code is very insulated from the &#x27;real world&#x27; and even from the rest of the system.",1374907486

In English that would be that your loop will execute/iterate at least g(x) times.<p>Now before people get any more confused Big  Θ(g(x)) is a tight bound , that means that your code/loop will run at least C1 * (g(x)) and at most C2 * (g(x)) . \nwhere C1 and C2 are two constants .<p>If anyone is interested they should really read CLRS.

Using MATLAB, you can analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models and applications. The language, tools, and built-in math functions enable you to explore multiple approaches and reach a solution faster than with spreadsheets or traditional programming languages, such as C/C++ or Java.<p>You can use MATLAB for a range of applications, including signal processing and communications, image and video processing, control systems, test and measurement, computational finance, and computational biology. More than a million engineers and scientists in industry and academia use MATLAB, the language of technical computing.<p>----------------------------------------------------------<p>I work at a place where people use (and abuse) MATLAB a lot. The thing is, they&#x27;re not programmers. As smart as they are (and they are truly brilliant) they&#x27;re not especially good with computers, programming or computer science. If they tried to use a &#x27;real&#x27; programming language, things would undoubtedly be <i>even worse</i>!<p>MATLAB is awesome at giving you powerful functions baked right in. That&#x27;s good because people who aren&#x27;t good at coding efficiently don&#x27;t have to. Instead of messing up the whole program from start to finish, they only mess up the top level and that often isn&#x27;t as big of a deal as messing up the small components that get used again and again and have to be as efficient as possible.<p>I agree that MATLAB isn&#x27;t a general purpose programming language, but I don&#x27;t think that that&#x27;s how MathWorks is really selling it (note that &quot;[creating] applications&quot; is at the end of the list and analyzing data is at the beginning). They&#x27;re mainly saying it&#x27;s good for solving a specific group of problems - those that technically minded people (like scientists, engineers, economists and financial analysts) have to solve.

When we want to do asymptotic analysis of algorithms we need to derive functions amenable to this analysis and for a given algorithm there is more than one derived function we might care to look at.<p>But in any Big-O situation the person is always, always, always talking about a function from the real line to the real line, with perhaps many layers of confusion and equivocation in between.  You should be able to suss out what function they&#x27;re &quot;really&quot; talking about.<p>Phrases like &quot;worst case&quot;, &quot;average case&quot;, and &quot;best case&quot; are shorthand for three of the most common derived functions.<p>If you want, think of a function T which takes as its input an algorithm and an input to that algorithm and returns its running time.<p><pre><code>  T(QuickSort)(x) = running time of QuickSort given x as its input\n</code></pre>\nthen<p><pre><code>  W(QuickSort)(n) = max { T(QuickSort)(x) : length(x) == n }\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re then in the business of doing asymptotic analysis on W(QuickSort), A(QuickSort), and B(QuickSort).",1374905774

Sure, the type errors are intimidating at first -- they pack a lot of information and use precise technical terms -- but once you figure one or two of them out you quickly begin to recognize the patterns. After that, you begin to feel comfortable correcting the type errors and subsequently feel confident about your program when it passes the type checker.<p>After a certain point in your progression, you realize that you can make certain type errors <i>deliberately</i> so that the type checker will tell you what types it&#x27;s expecting. This is when it all clicks! The type checker is a tool that lets you query for information about your program. It&#x27;s an immense aid to reasoning and a powerful sanity check against your assumptions. This is a capability that less strictly/statically typed languages lack and it can lead to a lot of surprises and guesswork.",1374905294

6112033,comment,6110671,6111899,1,0,jfarmer,,,"Let&#x27;s be precise.  I&#x27;m being more precise here in my comment than I was on Quora.<p>Big-O and related notations are ways of categorizing functions.  O(n^2) for example is actually a set of functions, which is why I wrote f  O(n^2) rather than something like f = O(n^2) or f(n) = O(n^2).  That is, f is a member of some set of functions which all satisfy a particular, precisely-defined property.<p>To understand that property, first, let&#x27;s get rid of the idea of &quot;performance&quot; because asymptotic analysis has nothing to do with &quot;performance&quot; <i>per se</i> and predates even the first precise definitions of things like &quot;algorithm&quot; or &quot;computability.&quot;  The notation itself was invented in the late 19th century.<p>Instead, let&#x27;s just talk about &quot;upper bounds.&quot;  If we have a function it&#x27;s easy to talk about upper bounds.  For example,<p><pre><code>  f(x) = sin(x)\n</code></pre>\nis bounded above by 1, 1.5, 10, 100, 80457, and an infinitude of other numbers for any real number x.  It&#x27;s bounded below by -1.<p>Now, in this case, it&#x27;s east for us to see that not only is<p><pre><code>  sin(x) <= 1 for all real x\n</code></pre>\nbut also that<p><pre><code>  max { sin(x) : x is real } = 1\n</code></pre>\nSo in this sense the upper bound of 1 is strict.  2 is also an upper bound in the sense that<p><pre><code>  sin(x) <= 2 for all real x\n</code></pre>\nbut it&#x27;s not strict.  There are other upper bounds which are strictly smaller than 2, e.g., 1.5.  So, we can say that &quot;the value of sin(x) for real x is no greater than 2,&quot; but we can&#x27;t say that it &quot;is&quot; 2.<p>So, to answer your point before diving deeper, Big-O is about &quot;worst case performance&quot; in this sense.  By itself it doesn&#x27;t tell us what the worst case performance is.  Instead, it gives us an upper bound on the worst case performance.  It says &quot;the worst case performance is no worse than FOO.&quot;  The actual worst case performance might be better.<p>Big- is the asymptotic equivalent to &quot;this is a tight upper bound.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll skip further development of this for now and jump back to the issue of algorithms.  The issue is this: given an algorithm with input of length N, we want to say something about how long it takes to run.<p>This means that the function we&#x27;re analyzing isn&#x27;t &quot;QuickSort(n)&quot;.  What does that even mean?  The input of QuickSort is an array of integers and it returns a sorted array of integers.  How can an array of anything be greater than or equal to n^2?  So that&#x27;s one way in which the CS vernacular equivocates -- we&#x27;re not really talking about QuickSort we&#x27;re talking about some other function:<p><pre><code>  T(n) = the amount of time it takes QuickSort to run given an input of length n\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re then talking about bounds on this other function T, asymptotic or otherwise.<p>But now we&#x27;re in a pickle because what does &quot;the amount of time it takes QuickSort to run given an input of length n&quot; mean?  There are many inputs of length n.  If we&#x27;re talking about just arrays of integers of length n, there are n! if all we care about is relative ordering and not the actual values in the array.  If we care about the actual values in the array then there are an infinitude of inputs of length n.<p>There are a few ways we can handle this.  Let&#x27;s re-define T(n) like so:<p><pre><code>  T(x) = the amount of time it takes QuickSort to run given input x\n</code></pre>\nOne way is the &quot;worst case&quot; method.  This says, ok, look at this function:<p><pre><code>  W(n) = max { T(x) : x is a valid input to QuickSort and len(x) == n }\n</code></pre>\nWe can now do Big-O, bounds, asymptotic analysis, etc. on W(n).  This is what we mean when we say the worst case is O(n^2).  It means W  O(n^2).<p>Another way is the &quot;average case&quot; method.  This says, ok, look at this function:<p><pre><code>  A(n) = avg { T(x) : x is a valid input to QuickSort and len(x) == n }\n</code></pre>\nThis is tricky if there are in principle an infinite number of valid inputs of a given length.  There are various ways of handling this issue.  For something like QuickSort we can see that it&#x27;s really only the ordering that matters, i.e., for the purposes of QuickSort [1,10,5] is the same operation-wise as [-50, 80, 0], so there are only n! inputs we really need to check for a given n.<p>Yet another way is the &quot;best case&quot; method, which looks at<p><pre><code>  B(n) = min { T(x) : x is a valid input to QuickSort and len(x) == n }\n</code></pre>\nSo, given an algorithm we can derive these three functions and then answer Big-O questions about them.  We&#x27;re never answering Big-O questions about the algorithm <i>per se</i>, although we can get away with equivocating when W(n), A(n), and B(n) are always equal or it&#x27;s obvious we only care about one of them.<p>For simple examples this is often the case, e.g., calculating the nth Fibonacci number in the standard iterative way has best, average, and worse case performance of O(n).<p>To make matters worse, most people say Big-O but mean Big-, or at the very least aren&#x27;t clear when they mean one or the other.  So, when one says &quot;worst case performance&quot; and we have W(n), A(n), and B(n) all being the same, it can be particularly confusing.<p>Depending on the algorithm in question which it might be understood what we care about one more than the others.  For example, if worst case inputs are particularly pathological we might talk as if we mean the performance of the algorithm per se but really be talking about A(n).  However, if &quot;bad&quot; inputs are common we might really be talking about W(n).",1374904933

6112028,comment,6111727,6111727,62,0,kyzyl,,,"Okay, I&#x27;ll bite on this one. I used matlab quite extensively (for years) in the medical imaging field, as well as other miscellaneous engineering (read: electronics, modeling, FEA. Not web apps) disciplines. I noticed several things about the matlab culture:<p>- In academia, people really do not seem to give a fuck about using the right tool for the job. I used to try to explain to the people in my lab why their software was crashing, why it took four days to finish running, or why it would be easier to write new code than try to adapt the code written by the undergrad from 5 terms ago. About 70% of the time is was because the code had been written in the most naive way possible. The rest of the time it was because it was written is matlab. Seriously, it takes tremendous effort to write matlab code that doesn&#x27;t suck. And even when you manage that, it&#x27;s still crappier than if you&#x27;d used a proper programming language. So, yes, the author is right to rag on matlab as a language. But you know what? NOBODY CARES! The process goes: Carve off a problem, write some code, produce plot, publish paper, put figure-indicative-of-progress into grant renewal application. The people in charge don&#x27;t care if twelve undergrads lost their eyesight debugging the code, and it stops working if the lab door is shut too loudly.<p>- I learned that if I just wrote my software in the proper language, in the proper way, and didn&#x27;t tell anybody I was doing it that way, everything worked out extremely well. The above cycle was allowed to complete, the people in charge usually didn&#x27;t even ask, and in a month when they asked me to adapt my work to include the marvelous thing the ultrasound lab had come up with I could just say &quot;Okay!&quot; without wondering if matlab would inexplicably fall on its face when I was 90% through the development.<p>- Even if you manage to get a conversation about choice of tools going, most of the people present will nod and pretend to be interested, but won&#x27;t change anything at all. The people who <i>will</i> &quot;see the light&quot; and make an active attempt to improve their understanding are generally the ones who would have done it on their own eventually. (side note: I did successfully--and accidentally--convert a large sect of the physics department to python, and it&#x27;s all they use now. They even started using proper SCM!)<p>- When working with matlab, I always had my best results when I did two things. First, keep the approach to coding as simple as possible. Don&#x27;t try to make things too generic, don&#x27;t try to make the code too fault tolerant, don&#x27;t try to implement STM. Second, use the built-in shit! There&#x27;s a toolbox for that? Use it, ship it. The idiomatic way to do something makes you ashamed to operate a keyboard? Do it anyway (usually). In other words, don&#x27;t fight it, because you will never get what you want. That doesn&#x27;t mean don&#x27;t do <i>any</i> error checking. That doesn&#x27;t mean blindly use libraries that give you the wrong answer. But overall I found the path of least resistance produced my highest productivity with matlab.<p>- Sometimes, matlab is actually kind of okay. I can still fit a univariate curve faster in matlab than I can in python, excel, gnuplot, or mathematica. I think R still probably has the most concise syntax for this task. Learn to understand the niche areas where matlab shines, and take advantage of that.<p>- As soon as the default performance of matlab is not good enough (i.e. profiling your code shows no obviously large improvements available), either change approaches, make your problem smaller, or stop using matlab. There are lots of options for improving the performance of matlab code: distributed computing toolbox, mex files (calling to C), proprietary optimizers/compilers like Jacket, contorting your problem to fit matlab&#x27;s memory layout... it goes on. However, I&#x27;ve found every one of them to be more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.<p>- Matlab is not a general purpose programming language. Know that, and be free.",1374904810

We'll have it fixed up in the next few days.<p>The forums truly are great. They're great because of relevance and quantity/quality of content. We'll probably add a few more parts over the next little while to seed the database so that you're more likely to find some content.<p>Here's an example of a part page:  <a href=""http://www.styckyd.com/forensics/products/23-hoosier-a6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.styckyd.com/forensics/products/23-hoosier-a6</a><p>The usefulness of the database will become more apparent as it grows towards some sort of critical mass. If you were to try and sell the Hoosier A6 listed above your listing would be pre-populated with the description that exists within the database which makes it easier for you to sell (Because you won't have to think as much about describing the benefits of the tire). The real benefit is when buyers are specifically looking for a set of Hoosiers.  They'll easily be able to find your listing. We also have a built in ""Want to Buy"" system. So if you click the ""Want to Buy"" link on the Hoosier page listed above and someone were to sell a set of Hoosiers at any point in the future our system will e-mail you - so you don't have to constantly browse the forums, just wait for the deal you're looking for.<p>Obviously, we're doing a terrible job of communicating these, and the other benefits that we provide. We'll fix it up very soon.<p>May I ask which forums you frequent?",1299203749

At that time it already had the highest GDP per capita in Asia; the first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew essentially ruled the country until 1990. Known as Harry to his friends, he attended an elite prep school in Singapore and later studied at the London School of Economics. He developed the institutions that were already present in Singapore rather than having to build them from scratch, and I think most people would agree that his governance was pretty paternalistic.<p>I personally think the British are pretty good at this sort of thing, and I say that as a native of a former British colonial possession myself.",1299203581

2286602,comment,2284741,2286318,0,0,shaddi,,,"Once again, I don't dispute that; we're in full agreement. My key point is that the effects of liberalism that lead to growth in Hong Kong did not lead directly to growth in rural China; as nice as that would be, there were other forces at play that caused that. Another way of putting this is to say that the effect of the communist government was to constrain growth around Hong Kong, and infrastructure development occurred in rural areas <i>despite</i> that.<p>The motivation behind ""charter cities"" is exactly that such a direct effect from liberalization would occur, whereas that doesn't necessarily follow and certainly not well-illustrated by the article's example. It is just one point in a broader criticism of the whole concept: such cities may provide an example, but they don't solve the (IMHO, harder) problem of affecting change in the non-charter city areas, which will still face broader structural obstacles. The existence of a Hong Kong is not a sufficient condition for broad  societal change, though it is certainly a helpful one, if not exactly necessary.<p>I'm happy to continue this discussion via email, no need to take up more of this thread.",1299203431
2286600,comment,2286050,2286334,0,0,christoph,,,"If you look at buying a non-used car, you might get a wide choice of colours in the brochure, but in all honestly, how many garages will sell you the exact colour you want (with the spec you want) there & then? People I know who have tried this, generally wait around two weeks or more from order to delivery, or settle for a slightly different spec.<p>I don't see how you can easily scale consumer electronics manufacturing to allow for a range of different colours (certainly not in the case of the iPad anyway), one key factor being that I don't think you can predict demand of individual colours reliably enough.<p>Then you have the issue of handling returns etc. People would get annoyed walking into an Apple store to swap a broken device, only to be told they've run out of that colour/spec combination. They can probably get away with it on the nano due to small product size, low manufacturing cost and limited spec difference (2 base models). If they made the iPad in five colours, you've suddenly upped the variation from 6 models to 30. That's a big leap and a big complication to many otherwise simpler business processes.<p>My TV comes in one colour, my toaster two, my SLR one, my printer one, heck even mass market clothing/fashion items rarely come in more than a couple of base colours these days. The majority of consumers are not bothered by purchasing something in a generic colour if the product is good enough, companies want to sell to this majority (not the minority of people that refuse to purchase something based on colour) to maximize profit.",1299203348

I only ended selling 2 of them and we donated the money to the Haiti Earthquake thing.  I definitely could have made a lot more had I been prepared to sell display ads. Simply putting a link on the site with a contact email for advertisers will get you plenty of offers if you really are seeing massive viral traffic.  Also, ALWAYS make a facebook page for the site you create.

It's necessary for Steve to trash them. And to be clear: the iPad 2 specs actually do trash them.<p>Big question: what's the next wave for Apple? I think it will be smart phones as a desktop/laptop replacement (you dock at home/work). Maybe a nano-sized smartphone replacement (or even smaller), for the next form-factor.<p><i>PS:</i> The Kindle will disrupt the iPad: it has a far cheaper yet more profitable business model; when the iPad becomes more powerful than it needs to be, the Kindle will be powerful enough.",1299200761

Less for lower quality of course, but then why are you doing HD in the first place? It's doable, but not realistic for most people.<p>You also need a monster CPU to compress video that much in realtime. With a slower CPU you'd get worse compression and need a faster connection (or lower quality).<p>Reducing framerate doesn't help as much as reducing resolution because little changes between frames, so there anyway isn't much to upload. (You either upload a lot infrequently, or a little frequently. It doesn't matter a ton. You get some benefit, but not much.)",1299200620

2286483,comment,2286399,2286399,0,0,warwick,,,"My concern with overlay scrollbars is that they don't seem to offer a clear affordance until the user has already taken steps to interact with them.  The nub that fades in has the same feel to it as those flash websites that require you to mouse over all the graphics, just to see which ones will perform an action.<p>Existing scrollbars look like something in a track that you can move back and forth.  Overlay scrollbars, particularly in iOS, aren't used to interact with the content.  You move the content itself, the scrollbars are just indicators showing your position.  They shouldn't look 'grab-able', because you never grab one.<p>The implementation shown in this post is grab-able, but doesn't look to be.  I think that's a mistake.<p>(I should note, iOS is the only place I have experience with overlay scrollbars.  I'm not qualified to discuss how they're used elsewhere.  If other systems use them differently, please chime in.)",1299200557
2286482,comment,2286260,2286260,0,0,jonknee,,,"> So why aren’t those who are criticizing Apple for taking a 30 percent cut of subscription revenue criticizing Amazon? My theory: everyone understands, intuitively, that the Kindle is a closed proprietary platform; but many people view iOS (incorrectly) as a platform like the Mac or Windows, where third parties are free to do what they want.<p>This seems like laziness or intentional dishonesty on Gruber's part. There are huge differences between the two. The biggest being Amazon doesn't have a Kindle app ecosystem so there isn't the [huge] problem of requiring a subscription option (which is the real issue--charge 90% if you want, it just becomes unfair when you require me to use it). Amazon also funds the delivery of the content to the subscriber, which considering it's often over 3G can be considerable.<p>In the current state of things if you are a publisher with an iOS app, Apple changed the rules to either require you to cough up 30% of your business or stop being a publisher. Also, you get the joy of delivering all content, that's not included in your 30% vig.",1299200540

The LiFePO4 chemistry doesn&#x27;t have the thermal runaway problem. That was a good decision. They give up some range, but don&#x27;t have fires.<p>Thermal runaway in LiCoO2 cells is the cause of most battery fires.  Overcharging or cell overheating starts a chemical reaction that raises the temperature, which accelerates the reaction further. This continues until the battery catches fire or explodes.  In battery packs, this can cascade, with one cell forcing adjacent cells into thermal runaway.<p>There are other safer battery technologies. The A123 Systems cells[1] don&#x27;t have the thermal runaway problem and are supposedly resistant to fires due to physical damage.  They pass the &quot;nail test&quot;, where a nail is driven through the battery.  Price is about 2x low-end cells from China.  A hoverboard powered with those should not catch fire.<p>A problem with &quot;Boosted&quot; skateboards is that they can easily be taken over via the Bluetooth link.[2]  Worse, they support over the air firmware updates. Unsigned over the air updates. There&#x27;s an exploit for this, called FacePlant.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.a123systems.com/lifepo4-battery-cell.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.a123systems.com/lifepo4-battery-cell.htm</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/08/hackers-can-seize-control-of-electric-skateboards-and-toss-riders-boosted-revo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2015/08/hackers-can-seize-control-of-el...</a>",1454957959

Both steel and textiles went overseas for price considerations, but I think that if US management and labor would have focused on improving quality and cost for each of those they would still be in business in the US (and Britain, etc).<p>In the 1970&#x27;s GM and Ford started the steps of getting out of the vertical integration business. This meant that their components could come from anywhere - competition was based on cost and quality; but mainly cost. Some perverse metrics here meant that internal suppliers drove themselves out of business because they did not improve quality.<p>For example: for a very long time, automotive components were produced on an Inspect and Reject scheme, where a large lot of material was built up at one site (internal or external) and then inspected at point of use. The manager at the component production site was compensated based on number of units produced, effectively driving down quality. The manager at the point of use was also compensated based on number of units produced, again driving defects into production units as bad material was used in production.<p>People who work mainly with code would do well to remember that physical production is <i>hard</i>. Also, incentives will <i>always</i> have perverse  outcomes over a long enough timeframe. There&#x27;s no way to list all of your assumptions when you set up incentives.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d love to hear stories like this from other physical products (like textiles and steel for instance).",1454957831

Someone who is poor and must be paid next week or start to go hungry, for example, makes much different economic decisions than someone who still needs to work to eat but has a cushion -- they can go several months without pay without risking starvation hunger.  Even though they are in similar danger over time periods that are not too different, the second groups act as if it is no danger at all.<p>So there is a time horizon dependency at the moment of decision.  I wonder how the complexity of the likelihood calculation affects the falloff rate of the death or pain variable?

I imagine with something like your link the difference will be much less noticeable for allocation speed. However, not having an explicit free can lead to performance benefits, though it seems counter-intuitive. Imagine you are allocating a large number of small, short-lived objects. In the manual case, you have to explicitly call free() for each object as it goes out of scope. The free() call is rather fast for slab allocators, and free-ing everything runs in time O(dead_objects). A well-designed generational GC uses a copy collector for the eden generation, which essentially allocates a new slab and copies over all the live objects, and then frees the old slab. Copying objects is relatively fast for small objects, and this algorithm runs in time O(live_objects), which is much much smaller than the number of dead objects. Plus The copying step moves all the live objects together on the slab which reduces memory fragmentation.",1454956578

Here&#x27;s how it works.<p>Electricity is broken up into generation costs, distribution costs, retail costs, regulatory costs, and profit.<p>Generation capacity goes up and down throughout the day, as does demand. In New Zealand an automated auction happens 30 minutes where generators bid in electricity at a price. The system operator then buys capacity required at any particular area at the cheapest price that is available. This sets the wholesale price of electricity.<p>This then gets distributed by the system operator throughout the country to a local lines company. They maintain the power lines to your house, but also to that person in the middle of nowhere.<p>The energy company figures out how much you&#x27;ve consumed, and bills you. Of course, when you have a problem, you call them, so there&#x27;s a call centre always available as well.<p>Finally, there are taxes and levies that the government applies.<p>After all that, if there&#x27;s anything left over between the retail price, and the sum of those costs, well, that&#x27;s the profit.<p>The weird bit is, where do you set the buyback rate for solar? The retail price? But there&#x27;s so much expenses there, not all of which are the retailer&#x27;s cost. The fair price of the market is the generating price, or wholesale price. But, there maybe political incentives to set a higher rate, as well as cap the number of people who can get that higher rate.<p>But if you want it sustainable for everybody, then using the wholesale rate makes more sense.",1454956423

The slow growth is because they tend to be located in exposed areas that have little soil and therefore not much storage for water, which limits growth but also reduces risk from fires, fungus, and other pests that jump from tree to tree.  They may also be at the treeline, where temperature is a limiting growth factor as well.<p>One of the first papers to document this is a paper by E. Schulman of Caltech in 1957, called <i>Longevity under Adversity in Conifers</i> [0]. Since then, this has been confirmed extensively in many more environments and tree families than Schulman analyzed. The basics are that slower growth minimizes resource use as well as the attack surface to pests, so the organisms can subsist for thousands of years until they are killed by climate change, or more frequently, the ground eroding out beneath them. It&#x27;s somewhat reminiscent of the stereotypical monk/lama/mystic living an ascetic life in a cave in the mountains high above the gluttonous cities. However, the basic ideas of finding a niche on the fringe, limiting risk exposure and resource use, and staying small for a long time are completely inappropriate to the tech community, of course.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://wmrc.edu/history/docs/science-1954.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wmrc.edu/history/docs/science-1954.pdf</a><p>(edited for clarity)",1454955975

However, a reasonable alternative is to depend on nonstandard annotations to disable TBAA: `__attribute__((may_alias))` for every popular compiler other than MSVC, which I believe doesn&#x27;t do TBAA at all.  (If MSVC ever adds it, the generated C code would need updating, but that&#x27;s not the end of the world.)<p>As for MIR - while I said AST, I suspect it would be fine to do it on MIR, at the cost of having to reconstruct some control flow.  The biggest problem with doing it on LLVM IR is the simplified type info, while the full info is still there for MIR, right?  Not an expert.  Anyway, it&#x27;s just an idea.",1454955722

The cost is going to vary widely throughout the grid, but the EIA estimates an average of ~$0.04/kWh across the entire US [1].<p>Most storage costs are somewhat easier to estimate, as batteries costs are well known. Current prices on new lithium ion batteries put the cost at ~$0.15-$0.20/kWh. This is probably not the most cost effective storage model, vanadium redox flow batteries, or hydro storage, or used car lithium ion batteries will drive this down substantially. Also, storage costs are dropping dramatically, while transmission costs are unlikely to change much.<p>For many locations, it may make far more sense to pay $0.20/kWh than to build out the grid to that location.  And this is definitely true for many locations, even in California, that are only a few miles away from grid-connected homes. It&#x27;s all a matter of the costs of current technology, discount rates for the cost of up-front capital investments, and the expected tech curve.<p>Long-distance transmission does have the potential to hugely improve the cost-effectiveness of intermittent renewables. A recent study tried to optimize costs using high-voltage DC interties between US grids to distribute renewable energy across the country, and found that storage was not necessary, even when transitioning a huge percentage of the power source to renewables. [2]<p>>There are going to be factories that probably can&#x27;t realistically be supported by batteries<p>This again is all a matter of cost.  I do think that transmission can help a ton here. But I think there&#x27;s going to be both time shifting (storage) and distance shifting  (transmission) in the future.<p>I think that people underestimate the rate at which storage will get cheap, just as they did with wind and solar, but that&#x27;s just my humble opinion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/tbla8.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/tbla8.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/making-a-single-us-electrical-system-boosts-renewables-lowers-costs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/making-a-single-us-el...</a>",1454954932

Where would we be today without all of the work done by military rocketry and civilian space programs?  Without various nations&#x27; space programs, scientists working on diseases including malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis would not have had access over the last twenty years to high-bandwidth communications services via communications satellites at hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and schools scattered across some of the most remote areas of the African continent---to name just one region with which I have direct involvement.  I cannot even begin to stress how important that kind of access is even in this modern age of relatively good 2G/3G coverage (there are still plenty of locations in which we work to cure disease where satellite communications are still a necessity).  It made it possible for our scientists to not only train their colleagues in country and raise up new generations of skilled doctors, nurses, and scientists, but also to access the sum total of scientific knowledge from places where good people frequently suffer and die from the kinds of endemic disease rarely seen in the West.  Maybe searching web sites or holding conference calls seems droll and ordinary to you, but to our scientists and their colleagues, getting Internet access via satellite in the middle of sub-Saharan Africa during the late 90s and early 00s was revolutionary.  So much good work---the fruit of which we see bearing now, like not just one but several effective malaria vaccines as well as mosquito population control programs---became possible, all because fifty years ago, people started &quot;philandering&quot; with space exploration.<p>How much hubris do you need to think that you alone know how best to allocate not only the scarce resources of this planet but also the lives of every single human being on this planet, and to sit in judgment of what work is worthy and what isn&#x27;t?  To transcend the current boundaries of human knowledge and engineering skill has a direct impact on our (collective) lives, and for the better.  This world is not zero-sum; it is not in thermodynamic equilibrium.  For some people to work in space for the eventual benefit of mankind as a whole does not require other people to suffer and die of want and neglect (quite the opposite, in fact).",1454954920

Animals have families and feelings, and to think that kindness before killing them is an answer is totally wrong. ...<p>There is always fear in their eyes. They know exactly what is going to happen. So for anyone to claim there is such a thing as humane slaughter, well, that&#x27;s the greatest oxymoron in the world.&quot;</i> - Howard Lyman, former rancher<p>I also like this story:<p><i>I meet a woman in a club, buy her drinks, make her laugh, dance with her, she&#x27;s having the time of her life, we go to my place, I make her favorite dish, she drinks the best wine, music is playing, she feels absolutely great, sitting on couch, watching her favorite movie, meanwhile, she&#x27;s sipping that drink, that has date rape drug in it. She passes out, I rape her. Humanely. Next morning she feels a bit drowsy, she thinks it&#x27;s the alcholol, she smiles, says she felt perfect although she can&#x27;t remember the rest of the evening. I was gentle, she doesn&#x27;t feel raped.</i> John Doe, humane rapist<p>It is absolutely irrational to call slaughter humane. This rationalizing to make things morally right is the common mistake people make. It is a mistake in deduction and reasoning.<p>Some philosophers would probably say I&#x27;m a deontologist, and they would say that consequences of a deed make a deed wrong not that the deed itself is wrong - which is my opinion. Are there no consequences to massive animal slaughter and flesh consumption? Is waste of tax-payer&#x27;s money a consequence big enough, maybe climate change, massive pollution?<p>Any rational process, any non-laughable branch of philosophy will say that slaughter is immoral and that there&#x27;s nothing humane about it - and that humane is an adjective that cannot stand by it.<p>I have no problem with people eating meat, but people who rationalize it through appeal to nature, through skewing morals, that&#x27;s what I have a problem with.",1454954739

Require a retainer for a large portion of the estimate. The retainer is to be applied against the last invoice so that you are never in a situation where the client owes you money.<p>5.

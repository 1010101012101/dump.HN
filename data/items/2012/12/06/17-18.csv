Technology is 5-6x bigger, but the tech companies trying to disrupt content are an insignificant fraction of that industry.<p>Meanwhile, set aside whether you believe in the reforms proposed in the Khanna memo --- reducing statutory damages, increasing cost of enforcement, reducing copyright terms. Ask instead, ""was this a politically effective policy memo?"" Were its goals in the 113th congress realistic? Were its arguments persuasive? Something like 35% of all congresspeople are lawyers, and this memo starts out with a highly dubious argument about the meaning of the copyright clause.<p>It seems to me (and I am prepared to hear smart people tell me how wrong I am about this) that a reasonable short-term goal would have been to reduce the term of copyright, ratcheting it back to where it was, say, before Sonny Bono. Instead, this ""RSC"" memo proposed beyond that a gift basket of what seem like mostly not-useful policy trinkets for Redditors: expanded fair use for DJ culture (really? spend political capital to modify regulations on a $100bn industry for... DJs?), lower statutory caps for damages (the MPAA and RIAA already sue for a tiny fraction of the likely liability for many infringers), and punishing false copyright claims (the claims studios take to court are overwhelmingly not false; penalizing bogus DMCA takedowns wouldn't move the dials at all).<p>The real copyright reform is probably something like reduced term and compulsory licensing. What was the value to the RSC of trolling the Content industry for reforms that had no chance of happening, that wouldn't have actually kept people from being bankrupted by lawsuits, that wouldn't make it easier to launch tech companies, and that at the same time manage to almost uniformly enrage rightsholders?<p>Was this memo really ""shockingly sensible""?

So many people tell themselves, I'll stay in this job / city / relationship for one more year, till I get more experience / savings etc.  Making difficult decisions (instead of putting them off) forces us to clarify our values.  We might decide in the end to never leave the city, or the job, but we are happier because we <i>decide</i> consciously to, not because we dont' have a choice.",1354815887

My point was, current modern fashion empires (Zara, HM, etc.) are popular because they offer fashionable items often of random/poor quality (notice 'because' not 'despite'). Buy cheap, look good for the season, throw it away. One or two levels higher you got all the Tommy, Polo, Lacoste, etc. where you upgrade for the brand and better quality (I know it's still slave labor, but the quality <i>is</i> better). People buy clothes to look good, and buy the ones that look good in their affordable price range. It's how it works, and somehow I believe people wanting to buy a hoodie 'for lifetime' are a vast minority, especially in the hoodie target group. Yeah, I own a jacket which was cool 4 years ago, is cool now, and maybe will be still cool in the next 3 years if I don't destroy it, but durability is IMHO a weak selling point for an newborn apparel company who positions itself in the price range of the lower-end designer brand clothes.<p>I hope I clarified my opinion a bit, I'm not against quality, I just doubt it will work in the long run for the reasons above.",1354815559

At microprocessor startups, I ask about the pedigree (past experience, not educational credentials) of pretty much everyone I meet. I don't do that at software companies. The reason is, you pretty much never hear about a new team successfully making a high-performance microprocessor. Apple bought PA Semi, which had a moderately successful exit, but PA Semi was basically the SiByte team, which left after SiByte was acquired by Broadcom, and SiByte was composed of key people from DEC who had been working together for over a decade. When you hear about a new team where most of the people are smart new grads, they usually spend ~ $100M over five or six years years, find that they don't have a competitive product (or, more likely, don't even have anything that's close to working). If they have funding left to burn they may pivot a couple times over the course of a couple years before they burn through their cash and implode.<p>And that's despite microprocessor design being close to pure reason, in the grand scheme of things. Experience and wisdom matter a lot more in most endeavors. Something you see a lot, even here on HN, when non-CS/programming/engineering topics make it to the front page, are people who try to extrapolate from a few ""obvious"" facts and then come up with a conclusion that's completely and totally wrong.<p>In software, you hear about successful companies founded by people just out of school, or even people who have dropped out of school, all the time. ""Smart and Gets Things Done"" can be good enough to make a decent product. But, something you'd never want to hear from a plumber or a carpenter is ""well, I've read some books on the topic, and tried out some tools at home depot, plus I'm smart and good at hacking"".<p>Things like carpentry, manufacturing, etc. are hard. They're done so well here (in developed countries) that it's easy to forget an idea of how hard they really are. If you want to get an idea of how hard they are to learn from scratch, consider South Korea after WII. Its GDP per capita was lower than Ghana, Kenya, and just barely above the Congo[1]. For various reasons, the new regime didn't have much baggage, and they wanted Korea to become a first-world nation. The story I've heard is that the government started by subsidizing concrete. After many years making concrete, they wanted to move up the manufacturing chain and start making ships (among other things). They pulled some of their best people who had experience in business (having learned skills like management, operations, etc.) from working in concrete to try to build ships. They knew they didn't have the expertise to do it themselves, so they contracted out the plans and got detailed instructions how to build ships. They got plans from Scotland, because Scotland has a long history of shipbuilding. Makes sense, right? But, when the Koreans tried to build ships with Scottish plans and detailed step-by-step directions, the result was two ship halves that didn't quite fit together and sunk when assembled. For historical and geographic reasons, Scotland's shipyards weren't full-sized, and they built their ships in two halves and then assembled them. Worked fine for them, because they'd be doing it at scale since the 1800s, and had world renowned expertise by the 1900s[2]. The Koreans eventually managed to start a shipbuilding industry by hiring foreign companies to come and, build ships locally, and show people how it's done. It took decades to what we would consider basic manufacturing working smoothly, even though all of the requisite knowledge existed in books, was taught in university courses, and could be had from experts for a small fee. ""Smart and Gets Things Done"" goes so much further in programming than it does in virtually any other non-academic field.<p>Today, anyone with a CS 101 background can take Geoffrey Hinton's course on neural networks and deep learning[3] and start applying state of the art machine learning techniques[4] to research grade problems within a couple months. But, if you want to build a ship, and you ""only"" have a decade of experience with carpentry, milling, metalworking, etc., well, good luck. You're going to need it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp_per_cap_in_195-economy-gdp-per-capita-1950"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp_per_cap_in_195-eco...</a><p>[2] In 1913, 20% of the world's ships were built at Clyde.<p>[3] <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets</a><p>[4] About 1/3rd of the way through the course, he talks about a new technique that was published after the course actually started.

The hassle of the real can be minimized.  For example, I like clojure, and there are real benefits to theoretical things like immutability by default, or garbage collection.  This ability to reason mathematically while being practical is worth promoting in computer science and engineering. If I couldn't reason this way about programming, I wouldn't be a programmer.  Engineering <i>is</i> the intersection from theory to practice, and I appreciate that in computing, incidental complexity can usually be traced back to someone's neglect.  Without this, we only have heuristics.<p>There is no silver bullet, but things can be made measurably better.  We can accept reality without giving up on reason.  I think to prove it, we can look at the influence of mathematics on real discoveries in history, and maybe ponder if humans are just meant to think this way in order to make progress.  I hope my code reflects more order (purity, generality, conciseness) than chaos (special cases, entropy, technical debt).<p>I would just call the procs thing a 'wart' and avoid using it.

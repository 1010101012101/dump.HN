[Roosevelt] said this code made him &quot;happier than any other one thing...since I have come to Washington, for the code abolished child labor in the textile industry.&quot; He added: &quot;After years of fruitless effort and discussion, this ancient atrocity went out in a day.&quot;</i><p>Minimum wages for women were also a part of this.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/flsa1938.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/flsa1938.htm</a>",1430330203

If you only look at the number of current  minimum wage workers there may not be many, but we are talking about raising the minimum wage to $15. That means everyone under $15/hr is affected. So, I think the real question is how many people are making less than $15/hr. I skimmed this article <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States#cite_note-US_Census_Bureau.2C_median_income_for_total_labor_force-8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_S...</a> and it seems that median personal income is somewhere around  30K in the US. Well, $15/hr of full time work is about 31K. Therefor the number of people who will see a rise in their wages is potentially very large. So, I think that the problems with price increases are a real issue.<p>Another issue I thought of is this. If min wage workers all suddenly have wage increases by law, then businesses like fast food chains might just replace many them with machines. I mean, you already know your McDonald&#x27;s burger is disgusting, so probably wont mind if it gets pooped out of a dispenser like pudding. So, this policy may simply lead to layoffs.",1430330173

When minimum wage was introduced in 1938, it was for 25 cents per hour ($4.16 per hour adjusted to 2015), and was intended for low-skilled temporary jobs (they also had 44 hour work-weeks). Minimum wage only applied to 1/5th of the entire workforce in 1938. What does it apply to today?<p>Minimum wage jobs are supposed to be targeted at young unskilled/uneducated individuals, often times not supporting themselves nor a family (living at home while attending university or high school).<p>The problem is we now have a massive portion of the population attempting to live off minimum wage jobs instead of graduating into higher paid - higher skilled jobs.<p>We need to fix that. Raising minimum wage every few years when it perpetually becomes &quot;not enough to feed a family on&quot; is a near-sighted solution.

Then you start looking like you plan to discriminate. The idea is not to <i>solicit</i> photos of candidates when their looks are irrelevant to the position.

Where the line is drawn probably varies by company and is probably arbitrary. Linking to your GitHub that happens to also contain your photo is probably not a big deal to anyone. Having an online resume where half the screen is taken up by your picture is different, it is no different than a paper resume that has your smiling face in the corner. I don&#x27;t use GitHub (I don&#x27;t have the time - I&#x27;m too old) but I understand it to be a more &quot;social&quot; and &quot;casual&quot; atmosphere which a photo is acceptable while a resume is a &quot;professional&quot; document that might also link to a more &quot;casual&quot; document.<p>The &quot;rule of thumb&quot; of not including your photo with a resume is because it is irrelevant to your job qualifications and was previously used to openly discriminate. This is a big deal since people here at HN have shared their stories of discrimination based on age - would someone who is aging an a little over weight want to dedicate half a computer screen to their picture?<p>Companies may just request that any information sent to them doesn&#x27;t include a photo - this is a reasonable request.

9460181,comment,9459364,9459662,0,0,tracker1,,,"Getting it is easy.  Even with very good support for .Net (C#, F# mostly) in Mono, actually developing, deploying and maintaining an application outside of Windows with VS is problematic by comparison.  In the past I wrote a couple of web based applications in .Net that could readily deploy to Linux.  Even then, deploying to Windows was so less cumbersome than getting mod-mono working we decided it was worth the cost of Windows Web Server (or whatever the 2003 version was called).<p>At this point, they want to do this with Azure services.  Which is very easy to work against with very rich tools in .Net.  They&#x27;re extending this development ability to other platforms, so that hopefully people will choose to use .Net even if targeting other platforms in the hope that people will choose to deploy to Azure over other cloud providers in much the same way that I chose to deploy to windows a decade ago.<p>This doesn&#x27;t even count migrations of existing applications, which may well be better off on Azure (in windows) with new systems under Linux.  The past two years, I&#x27;ve spent supporting Windows applications where a next generation was moving to Linux (node/iojs).  Right now I&#x27;m doing this against Azure.<p>Being pragmatic, I&#x27;m even using Azure Storage (queues, tables and blob) for migration data, which means I don&#x27;t have to setup/configure/manage a bunch of servers to do these tasks.  Setting up RabbitMQ isn&#x27;t hard, but there&#x27;s time involved.  Setting up C* isn&#x27;t hard either, but if the data is transitional (using azure tables to hold data exported from the old system, and queues to trigger import into the new), it doesn&#x27;t make sense to configure my own server.  After using these services, I may use them more deeply, I&#x27;m already using Azure Tables for my configuration settings even, so I don&#x27;t have to maintain an etcd/consul cluster.<p>All of this said... while I am mindful of getting locked in, and do have a strategy for breaking out, and my core application data won&#x27;t be in azure services... actually using them makes me consider using them more.<p>From my own experience, what they are doing is a legitimate strategy and far better than how they approached it early on, and may still be.  I stopped attending .Net conferences/meetings about 4-5 years ago because they were turning into Azure sales presentations more than development presentations in general.  This is also the same time node.js started to become a viable contender, and I started using it for web project client files (js merge/min, less etc).",1430329703

There&#x27;s 11.5 million illegals in the US already [1] (edit: vs 3.3m legal workers on or below minimum wage [3]!), a large part of which are probably doing &quot;minimum wage&quot; type jobs for less than minimum wage. Every rise in the cost of doing business legally will push a few more jobs towards the illegal, or law-abiding businesses to bankrupcy from lack of competitiveness. My entirely anecdotal evidence places the dishwasher illegal salary in big cities (my data is from New York in 2010 or so) at around $3/hour.<p>Different countries handle the issue of high minimum wage differently. Some countries have very thorough enforcement and drive the cost of everything through the roof, but end up with a more egalitarian society (I think Norway, where a beer costs as much as a large meal in neighbouring countries, counts). Singapore chooses not to have a minimum wage and to make it easy to import manual labour legally, and affords these labourers the same legal protection afforded any other resident. China uses the hukou system [2] to regulate the influx of unskilled labourers into more prosperous regions.<p>The US simply turns a blind eye to the rule of law when it comes to unqualified labour, which allows businesses to keep their costs low, and politicians to save face and pretend they did something &quot;for the workers&quot;, whilst a side effect is increasing the stress on the legal unskilled residents which might even be a positive for politicians as they love a good crisis.<p>Conclusion: legal unskilled workers should fight for the law to be enforced, not for minimum wage to be legally increased. It would both remove competition and drive up demand for their unskilled work, and since there is no population explosion in the United States and legal immigration is incredibly regulated, should result in a natural rise of wages matching the higher cost of living in locations like Seattle.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigrant_population_of_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigrant_population_of...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-are-characteristics-minimum-wage-workers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-are-characteristics-mini...</a>",1430329664

The reason is the resume is the first impression of you - someone has to make a 60 second choice to look into you further - to call you or Google you. If you include a photo you are asking the company to evaluate your looks as part of the initial resume which have zero to do with your job qualifications. (we are talking about software here)<p>Like it or not employers make snap judgements without consciously thinking about it based on irrelevant characteristics. We know people with black sounding names get callbacks significantly less than white sounding names.[1] I can&#x27;t imagine how much more difficult someone who was a dark skinned black would have it if they included a photo. Remember - employers give a resume a once over and their unconscious bias in in effect.<p>No hiring manager or HR person will tell you they are openly racist or disregard candidates based on their name - and they aren&#x27;t lying! They just do it because social biases effect their evaluation without them realizing it. As much as we love to believe we are rational beings in a lot of ways we are not.<p>Also the reason why employers asked for a photo in a resume in the olden days was to openly discriminate against candidates. They didn&#x27;t want to waste their time interviewing or following up with someone who is black, Hispanic, ugly[2], or a woman when they were seeking a white male. Their resume would just be discarded. Now that sort of discrimination is illegal in hiring so they stopped soliciting photos because they stopped (openly) taking that sort of information into consideration. Since your looks are irrelevant to the job they will often throw out resumes that contain photos so they aren&#x27;t accused of taking looks into account when reviewing resumes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/opinion/nicholas-kristof-is-everyone-a-little-bit-racist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/opinion/nicholas-kristof-i...</a><p>[2]Being ugly/fat isn&#x27;t a protected class under federal discrimination laws in the US.",1430327984

First this minimum wage increase would probably happen over 5 years like San Francisco and Seattle are doing. So businesses would have time to prepare and it would not go from $9 -> $15. Second, these companies have many costs outside of labor. If labor were to double for just employees making less than $15/hr, the price of everything would not just double. It would have to go up, of course, but it would not double. The final thing to consider is that if every one in the USA is making more money, they will also have more money to spend. This means they are more likely to spend money at these types of businesses thus increasing daily sales for the company.<p>The argument you are making is an extremely common argument from before the minimum wage was instituted decades ago where minimum wage was also (relatively, of course) significantly higher than it is right now.

To me, employers <i>never really paid for benefits</i>.  It was the <i>employees wages</i> that was converted into health insurance as a loophole to circumvent WWII wage controls.<p>Using this &quot;employee&#x27;s-total-compensation&quot; frame of reference, the real value add from the employer was having a Human Resources staff handling the administrative headaches of benefit plans.  The &quot;employer&#x27;s health insurance&quot; has always been the &quot;employee&#x27;s money&quot; that was preallocated.<p>Today, employers providing health insurance is a voluntary arrangement.  Employers do it to stay competitive in attracting job applicants.  If employers are voluntarily providing insurance, and if the employer insurance component goes away, it seems logical that they will also <i>voluntarily</i> adjust wages offered in the marketplace for employees-DIY-insurance (because WWII wage controls are no longer preventing it.)<p>As an analogy, when Amazon or other retailer says they offer &quot;free shipping&quot;, does that <i>really</i> mean they pay shipping?  Isn&#x27;t it really us, <i>the customers that pay that free shipping</i>?  Therefore, &quot;free shipping&quot; is just a synonym for &quot;the shipping cost you paid is baked into the price and through Orwellian doublespeak, we restate it back to you as free shipping.&quot;<p>Isn&#x27;t &quot;free shipping&quot; frame-of-references similar to &quot;employer provided insurance&quot;?",1430327835

E.g. let&#x27;s suppose we agree to give 5% extra to Macdonalds at the register to distribute to its employees in some equitable fashion. So my $12 order (two happy meals and a burger, say) costs me an extra $0.60. <10 people are processing something like 200 orders per hour (I suspect it&#x27;s more like 5 people and 400 orders, I&#x27;m guesstimating), so that&#x27;s $12 for each of them. But let&#x27;s assume there are another ten people in the logistic chain. So that&#x27;s $6/h for each of them.<p>Now imagine the flow-on effect to the rest of the economy if people in those horrible jobs had some kind of living wage. I suspect not only would these workers be $6/h better off, I&#x27;d probably be better off too.",1430327238

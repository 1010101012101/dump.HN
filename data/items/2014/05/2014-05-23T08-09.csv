7788523,comment,7787384,7788390,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"The underlying concepts and the approach are very similar. The idea of a non-assertion pledge (or defensive patent pool) is a refreshing example of forward thinking Businesses and Organizations that recognize the adverse effects that Patent Trolling has on innovation. Google is a great example [1]. The Open Patent Foundation takes this concept, and applies it with a different approach. Instead of choosing a specific focus or scope, we want to allow the Community (as a whole) to drive the creation of Open Patent License(s). The end result would be a set of Licenses that any Person or Organization could use and apply towards any Intellectual Property or Patents they may own. So some of them may end up being specific to Software. others may end up being specific to Utility Patents. And yet others might end up being non-specific in terms of application, but specific to a Time Period, or perhaps Distribution Guidelines. It would be up to the Community to decide what we want to use, and that is what (IMO) makes the entire concept so powerful. It is not implied to be a better approach, just a new one. In the end, all of these types of movements are positive. The end goal is to accelerate innovation and stop Patent Trolling.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/</a>",1400835453

7788519,comment,7783201,7786834,3,0,roel_v,,,"&quot;The interaction between down payment rate and mortgage insurance rate also reveals a limitation of our user interface: On the one hand, itâ€™s nice to have all the variables decoupled so that you can set and explore them independently. On the other hand, many of the variables are not independent. If you change one variable, you may need to change other variables to maintain a realistic scenario.&quot;<p>Well I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call this a &#x27;limitation&#x27; of your UI. This is actually a very common issue when designing user interfaces for models (I have been doing this for a living for almost 15 years). There is a continual tradeoff between the positives of the software ensuring internally consistent, <i>and</i> realistic, values - and allowing the user flexibility for edge case exploration. And then there are issues like discoverability, speed of use, technical limitations, etc. - as always.<p>One of my favorite mental toys in this area is: devise a way for a user to assign a fixed amount (call it a &#x27;budget&#x27;) to several categories. For a simple example, consider a budget of $100 over 5 expense categories. But it should also work for allocating a road maintenance budget across 25 districts, or for assigning a weighting to the importance of policy objectives (ecology, health, economic growth for example).<p>In the vast majority of cases, after several meetings about this, clients say &#x27;fuck it, let them copy/paste their own values from Excel&#x27; (at this point I come in and broker a truce between the warring factions of several solutions and implement a meet-everybody-halfway solution :) ) It&#x27;s one of those &#x27;how hard can it be?&#x27; <2 weeks later> &#x27;oops yeah pretty hard&#x27; things.",1400835238

Drones might pretty cool and useful, until one drops from they sky and mauls pedestrians or vehicles.<p>So, at least in areas with a lot of people, the same places where small drones can be very useful, there needs to be quite a large built in safety. This means encrypted communication for drone control, resilience for radio jamming, quite a lot of built in autonomous abilities to handle anomalities. And probably some big physical changes to lower potential damage. Don&#x27;t underestimate the damage small fast spinning propellers can do.<p>Initially this might mean drones either get banned, or get banned after the 1. incident, slowing down adoption and increasing cost to make them safer.",1400834872

I ran a similar experiment where I stopped washing my hair, after I detoxed from shampoo/conditioner, my hair stopped smelling. It only smells for a few days and then the natural oils take over and do their job.<p>My fiance who is currently becoming a registered nurse said her teacher ran an experiment which concluded that if you wash your hands properly and long enough (at least 30 seconds) using water, it does as good a job as soap/antibacterial handwash. To prove this he swabbed students hands and also ran them under a light to inspect for anything foreign. He of course also made sure to mention that in a hospital using water would not fly, but I thought it was an interesting result.<p>What did we use before shampoo, soap and conditioner? Nothing. Mankind has lasted this long without buying antibacterial products, hasn&#x27;t it?  I think if anything, antibacterial handwashes, shampoo and conditioner have contributed to our unhealthy society, especially when put into combination with our zero nutritional diets and pollution-led lifestyles. I think we all get so sick because we don&#x27;t expose ourselves enough to the common bacteria and germs that lurk in our everyday lives. At the end of the day we as humans are nothing more than bacteria. Look up a video of what happens inside of our bodies when we digest food, we are bacteria ourselves.",1400833725

There are in fact 4. The actual program, call this P, you want to run on your data, the program to encrypt your program P along with its data, call this E, the virtual machine to run this encrypted program on the server, call this V, and finally the program to decrypt the result from running V on the output of E, call this E&#x27;.<p>Clearly, if we compose all these programs and run it on some data D, we get E&#x27;(V(E(P, D))) = P(D).

If you sell specialist goods or expensive home electricals then those people coming through the door have invariably checked you out online first. However, those sales are recorded as High Street sales, from walk-ins, not &#x27;e-commerce sales&#x27;. It is the bricks and mortar stores that dominate e-commerce with the exception of online-only Amazon.<p>A lot of suppliers don&#x27;t want to deal with online only stores. To do so upsets their other retailers so you have to be bricks and mortar to get the suppliers. Plus you have to sell at their prices.

I can get that at a random hackathon locally. The real prize is getting an enterprise deal done with Edenred to implement the product. Insist on retaining all IP rights to everything, which is normally the case for all hackathons. If they balk, mention that Salesforce hackathon participants get to keep their IP. That&#x27;s about as high profile as it gets. Having won enterprise software events in the past (eBay/PayPal and Ford), I can tell you that they open very interesting doors if your objective is to sell enterprise software.<p>Other than that, it&#x27;s probably going to be 1-4 people coding and 11 people taking notes and participating in Group 2 and Group 3 portions of the project. The team will be overstaffed on marketing and sales side, which could be interesting.<p>I would probably do it to lay the foundation to sell them something after the event.<p>Background: My team won a Ford event, they sponsored our trip to Vegas, paid for a 5-star hotel at a bargain rate of $350/night, gave us CES Exhibitor badges and some spending money. So that&#x27;s somewhat similar experience. No regrets, I got lots of business opportunities as a result of this and the red badge was a magnet for press. :)",1400832045

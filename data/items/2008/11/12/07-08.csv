It's not the numbers that count but the quality.<p>Has there been any academic research on the average quality of technical graduates in the USA versus India and China? I don't mean just memorization of facts and formulas, but ability to creatively solve real-world problems. Perhaps that's impossible to objectively measure.",1226476617

361572,comment,360664,360824,0,0,jhancock,,,"It is true there are many facets of China.  The way some expats live in Shanghai or Beijing is a small view of that.  Amongst the locals, the lifestyles are highly diverse.  The difference between East and West China is enormous.<p>I have lived in Shanghai for over 8 years (I'm a white male from the U.S.).  I live in the nicest part of town and my office is a comfortable 5 blocks walk from home.  I pay dearly for this comfort.  And I'm not naive about what the high cost differential is buying me.  I do know how the locals live.  I'm married to a local Chinese lady and we have a family together where I deal with issues of raising a child according to multi-cultural values.<p>Do not confuse the simple fact that many expats are willing to pay for whatever comforts of home they can with the fact that most of us that have been here a while are aware of the difference.<p>If you are young and ready for an adventure, come to China and live like the local poor for a while.  It will be a great life experience.  After that, you should have enough perspective to use what money you have to live with what comforts you find most desirable.",1226475920
361571,comment,360664,361023,0,0,cglee,,,"The major difference there is that China caters to expat enclaves because they have money, just like US caters to Jewish enclaves. Yes, I agree it's elitist, but that doesn't make it any less 'real'. It's part of today's China.<p>Your example is also a little off; immigrants band together out of necessity and survival. That's why there are Chinatowns and Indiantowns, etc. It's in their best interest.<p>Side note: expats tend to flock to other expats due to several reasons, but one is also survival. It's much easier to find friends or business partners with other expats because there less ulterior motives. As an expat, whenever you meet a native Chinese, you're not sure they're nice because you're an expat and they need something, or what. In fact, most Chinese people are very regionalist and are not 'nice'. They're only nice because they think you have money.",1226475832

361555,comment,361542,361542,0,0,alecco,,,"Pagination is not just necessary but the only way for many scenarios in production. A typical example is fetching sorted and transformed search results from a large catalog. Without pagination you get to terabytes. Not just that I/O would take ages and cpu usage skyrocket, it would make the system un-cacheable too. This is very common for large web services. Of course, it all depends on the details.<p>On the other hand, many content websites often do pointless pagination (perhaps to increase page views for ads.)",1226474035

But the real question, imho, is how do average programmers compare? How will the same app written in C++ and Java compare, when written by non-superstars? The question merits some empirical research.",1226473969

Only in small tech companies are the technical problems so important that the engineers become strategic advantages.  That kind of thinking is still pretty rare.<p>(But for what it's worth, your hypothetical Bain consultant is earning a six-figure salary, traveling around the world and developing hugely important business experience and professional contacts that will serve him well when he leaves consulting.  Even the best engineering jobs have limited expanse and authority -- you interact with techies, focus on the details of implementing someone else's vision, and rarely rise to a level where strategic thinking is required.)",1226473921

But if it already has some votes I leave it there... Unless it has a double digit number and the other side is much lower, then sometimes I down-vote (and feel almost guilty about it.)<p>Many times I agree with someone but their post is incomplete or has a part that isn't good, then the replies tend to say the whole side is invalid because of that...

361545,comment,361294,361528,0,0,bokonist,,,"You make a pretty broad generalization that programming sucks as a career.  I think you need to compare the best engineering jobs to the best MBA jobs, and the average engineering job to the average MBA job.  So compare working at justin.tv to working as a Bain consultant.  And compare being a typical big company engineer to being a middle manager.  Does engineering still come out poorly as a career choice?

361544,comment,361294,361366,0,0,jhancock,,,"There are many aspects to consider in the differences in drop-out rates.  One is that not all engineering programs are the same.  MIT's education is very different than RPI's or Georgia Tech's (I'm went to GT).  The RPI or GT style is more like 5 years of boot camp (yes, its really a 5 years program, another problem to consider when comparing against a management degree). Its a non-stop grind of 6 classes at a time with tests every week.  MIT's is fewer classes with higher student:teacher ratio.  The MIT program is structured to guide students to the finish line.  The GT or RPI approach is very clear that they are trying to cull students.<p>I don't think either approach is wrong.  They are just different.  Do they produce different types of engineers?  maybe.  There are many other aspects to consider as well.",1226473220

3719394,comment,3717715,3718963,2,0,chousuke,,,"My intuition tells me that hiding data in objects does not really help as long as the data is still mutable. Immutability is the only way to guarantee true encapsulation for objects that don't actually represent something inherently stateful. (eg. file on disk)<p>Coupling data and operations is also a <i>problem</i>. It's non-extensible, both in that you can't add more data and use the same operations, and you can't add more operations that work on the added data. Inheritance works around some of this, but it doesn't solve the general problem. What if it makes sense to add the same piece of data to objects of classes from different parts of the hierarchy?<p>The thing about functions is that you can always write a new one that works with anything you want. You don't need to add it to a class or an interface (you can, if the language allows that), and if possible, with immutable data that essentially makes the function a unit of perfect encapsulation.",1332060953

Non whitehat SEOers are wising up to the idea of a site targetting niches, and that considerably widens the list of appropriate keywords.<p>By tackling the long tail keywords en masse - these are less competitive, easier to rank for, and correlated better to buying intent; gradually they make significant inroads to ranking strongly for the big-head keyword in a manner that looks more natural.",1332060942

3719390,comment,3719123,3719123,7,0,cek,,,"In Windows Vista and Windows 7, the ability to have a PC act as a RDP server (host) is limited to the server SKUs and Ultimate.  Windows Starter, Windows Home, and Windows Home Premium do not have this feature (it's actually there, but requires a hack to enable).<p>This was a business policy to help differentiate the Pro & Ultimate versions from the cheaper Home versions.<p>When we were building Windows Home Server, I fought hard to get the policy of not supporting Remote Desktop (host) in Windows Vista/7 Home and Home Premium changed.<p>We wanted to make it so that WHS could more easily enable people to connect into their home computers remotely via WHS, but the policy meant that only Windows Vista/7 Ultimate and Pro could act as a RDP host which severely limited the reach of this feature.<p>It is probably a good thing (for MS) that I failed to convince the Windows business leaders to change this policy; imagine how many PCs there'd be out there if in 2003 I had gotten this policy changed and had been successful in making RDP popular amongst non-power users...<p>As an aside, I bet sizable # of those RDP end points Dan found are actually running Windows Home Server.  WHS (which is really a version of Windows Server 2003) enabled the RDP host by default because that's what the Windows Home Server console uses. It also used UPnP to enable port forwarding for remote access to the server.  Users' have to opt into this feature, but many do...<p>The good news (for WHS users) is by default WHS automatically takes Windows updates; users have to explicitly opt-out and we intentionally tried to push them away from opting-out of updates.  So almost all WHS boxes probably got the patch on Tuesday.  I know mine did.",1332060627
3719389,comment,3718065,3718470,2,0,mckoss,,,"You're confusing ""clients"" (or Bitcoin nodes) with miners.  All clients share information about pending transactions through a peer-to-peer network.  A small % of those clients are also mining - incorporating (or not) transactions into a block and attempting to find a sufficiently rare hash value.<p>Since most mining is done in pools, there is quite a concentration of power in pool operators; if they want to ignore certain types of transactions, they can just omit them from the blocks that they mine.<p>The real threat is that if any mining pool that had more than 50% of the world-wide hashing power, they could effectively control which transactions would become verified, and which would remain forever ""pending"".  They would accomplish this by ignoring all other mined blocks, knowing that they will be able to outrace the rest of the world in producing the chain representing the ""most difficulty"".<p>Ordinary (non-mining) clients can disrupt the propagation of transactions around the network - but as long as you have a possible communication path to SOME miner, you should be able to have your transactions registered in a new block; like the Internet, the bitcoin network has redundant paths to foil censorship from a minority of nodes.",1332060619

3719387,comment,3717422,3719025,1,0,Isofarro,,,"Various bits of the lowercase semantic web (and its related uppercase Semantic Web cousin) factors show through on Google results - mostly Google Rich Snippets, so reviews metadata. These mostly require human intervention to enable on a site-by-site basis (sometimes by the site owner, sometimes by humans in Google itself).<p>The deeper problem of the semantic web is that it's meta data, which tends not to be visible to visitors. And because of that, it's easy to forget / overlook / incomplete, and nefariously allows SEO over-optimisation invisibly that non-whitehat SEOers do in full view of the human audience.<p>I wish it wasn't true, but Cory Doctorow's portmanteau of metacrap is unfortunately still accurate ( <a href=""http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm</a> ). We have made several small metadata improvements over the years, but not much progress in substantially overturning Doctorow's original concerns.<p>Human beings are not great sources of accurate and up-to-date metadata. So we rely on scripts and services to fill in the blanks that we don't. (publish times being recorded in WordPress, for example.)<p>Converting human content into metadata ends up being an automated human-hands-off affair which means that those automative tools need to be able to parse and extract information / meaning from human prose. Very much what Google has been doing since inception.<p>It's flawed because it relies on automated interpretation of prose. But there isn't a viable non-flawed method of getting the same information without imposing academic-like constraints to the Web.",1332060497

Write better!<p>The real world doesn't always work like that. I do a lot of work for an eCommerce site that sells wholesale. Their customers have little to no interest in reading text, all they want are pictures. Which means, the catalogue pages, which are optimised for actual human visitors and not Google robots, contain little to no text, only pictures. As a result, the catalogue pages (most important part of the site) do not rank anywhere with Google, and never will. Google is unable to handle websites that are - quite correctly - all about the pictures. Competitor sites that outrank this particular site design their catalogue pages for Google, not for humans, and rank well because of it.",1332059352

3719374,comment,3719003,3719003,12,0,jstepien,,,"During the previous semester I spent some time building a recommender using this data as a project for a data mining class. It turned out to be far more challenging than I had initially anticipated.<p>I've used methods known as collaborative filtration, whose goal was to estimate how a given user would rate a given item basing on knowledge of preferences of other users of similar interests. The initial scope included a nave Bayesian classifier and a technique called Slope One [1]. The latter one is particularly interesting as according to claims of its authors allows to make a very good estimation in a very short time using solely a very simple linear model. The preprocessing is both time- and space-wise expensive though as it requires you to build a matrix of deviations between rated items.<p>After reducing the data set to a single subreddit and filtering it from users who weren't avid voters I ran the algorithms and after some tuning I was very content to see promising ROC curves and decent AUC values. Models built around NBC and S1 achieved comparable results when it came to such metrics as precision, recall and F-measure.<p>When I went to discuss the results with the professor teaching the class I've heard ""That's indeed promising, but how about comparing those results with a <i>really</i> nave model which would just take an average of existing votes by a given user?"". Guess what: the model built solely using a single call to the <i>avg</i> function was nearly as good as the NBC and S1 models.<p>Now I understand why the guys from Reddit are looking for external help with the recommender. It's a way less obvious task than it might seem to be.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lemire.me/fr/documents/publications/lemiremaclachlan_sdm05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lemire.me/fr/documents/publications/lemiremaclachlan_...</a><p>Edit: s/machine learning/data mining/",1332059265

So yes, I would take 10 years, 50 years, maybe even instant death for making such a profound  positive impact on humanity.<p>I'd also like to take over Equatorial Guinea, but the current regime may fall before I get the chance.",1177925298

Obviously medicine is helping in a lot of ways, the body is not able to fix every problem by itself.<p>Perhaps I am missing out big time by not using drugs. Some famous works of art are probably the result of drug use (how much of it, I don't know). I also remember a recent anecdote about a rock musician meeting Tony Blair and asking him how he manages his workload. Answer: ""Certainly using different drugs than you"" - of course it could just be ""enthusiasm"" being the drug, I don't know.<p>If you could become a world famous artist in exchange for living 10 years less, would you do it? Or whatever is your ambition (invent the Google killer, whatever).",1177924508

336811,comment,336568,336568,0,0,lunchbox,,,"Interesting, but very questionable.<p>The argument seems to be rooted on evolutionary psychology: when times were tough in hunter-gatherer days, men needed women who could pitch in with work to help them survive. Plausible in general, but I'm skeptical of the exact definition used for ""difficult social and economic conditions"". In hunter-gatherer days, this meant droughts, blights, storms, epidemics, and other disasters that made you starve or freeze to death. In contrast, even in difficult economic times, modern middle-class American men (i.e. who could afford Playboy) probably do not have to deal with anything approaching the level of duress needed to make this survival instinct kick in.<p>By the way, not to be dismissive, but I think the term ""cute-o-nomics"" was invented for studies like this.",1224381108
336810,comment,336556,336683,0,0,netcan,,,"I think you may be hanging to tightly to the semantics.<p>Libertarianism is not being used (in this article or in general discussion) in its moral theory/political theory sense. They are referring to the derived economic policy theories.<p>Hype removed, it might read: 'End of government intervention as a taboo.'",1224380955
336809,comment,336556,336783,0,0,johnm,,,"Bah!<p>This knee jerk hysteria is exactly the same as the reaction to 9/11...  A major shock to the system freaks people out because the work isn't conforming to (comfort-oriented) expectations and so they instantly look to someone who looks good who promises them a return to mindlessness.<p>The abrogation of responsibility by the many for their own lives and the arrogation of authority/magical-ability/etc. by the few (and the selling of <i>that</i> to increase power/profit at the expense of everyone else) is exactly the underlying mechanism that created the emergent, systemic failures.<p>An example people might want to look at is the examples in traffic management whereby busy, dangerous intersections have been redone so that there's less separation and therefore more required of all of the participants to pay attention.<p>I particularly like that example but there are plenty of other good examples from the driving and traffic world if you look around.<p>Sigh.",1224380576

336805,comment,336500,336781,0,0,orib,,,"Hm. Never used the MP3 downloader myself, and Octave has been sufficiently compatible (ie, every bit of code I've encountered/written worked on both) for me to do all the Matlab courses and assignments that I've worked on. I suppose that I should have qualified my original statement -- all the software I cared about as an engineering-physics/computer science student that ran on Linux in the first place runs just fine on Linux 64 bit. (I miss CAD and a good GUI circuit designer, but those were also missing from 32 bit Linux)",1224380021

Each of them were assigned one of my accounts on either online dating sites like Match.com, or on social networking sites like Friendster, and there would be a $150 bonus to whichever team set the most good dates. Excluding the bonus, the entire experiment cost less than $200 dollars</i><p>If this is your thing then go for it, for me its too impersonal.",1224379989
336803,comment,336556,336783,0,0,dood,,,"I wasn't entirely aware I was conveying sentiments ;) As far as economics goes, my creed tends toward mysterianism (though you correctly deduce I have a soft spot for libertarianism).<p>I don't think we will make much progress in the field until we make and analyse many actual experiments. Even then I doubt that economics can be usefully understood. It is simply too complex.<p>I think the best chance of real progress (i.e. something other than rhetoric) is in simulation, or even better, massively multiplayer games. Eve Online is an interesting step in this direction.",1224379907

336799,comment,334355,336539,0,0,nostrademons,,,"5 years is a bit unreasonable.  Take a look at the salary chart on Wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm#Salaries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm#Salaries</a><p>Typically, you're about $160k in debt from law school, so the first year is spent paying that back.  The next 4 years taken together is only $795k, nowhere near enough to retire for life.  All the associate years together is only about $1.6M, still not enough to retire after 11 years.<p>Then you have to make partner; if you don't, you're out of the firm and usually have to set yourself up as a sole proprietor.  If you <i>do</i> make partner, you're set for life, but at 11 years getting there, the road is nearly as long as becoming a tenured professor and usually longer than becoming a successful entrepreneur.",1224378970

Tim ferris checks his email once per week. He did this while running a very profitable business. He got to where he is by employing these principles. And unlike other ""gurus"" that just make money on selling their ""guru"" information (like rich dad poor dad guy, tony robbins) this guy actually did  A WHOLE LOT of things. Now he is sharing his experience on ""lifestyle design"".<p>His advice is meant to free up your time, to invest in things that actually matter, and actually produce returns. Do you mean to tell me that posting on yc, checking your email a billion times a day, and screwing around on your phone is productive? It's not, you can bash me all you want, but it simply is not.<p>Being up to date on news is bullshit. Sure its ""nice to know"", but does it really get you anywhere? Read his thoughts on ""information overload"" and you will understand.<p>All this stuff we are doing, its ""nice"" but its not efficient, and optimized. If you want to get anything done in this life, you need to be efficient and optimized.",1224378798

336795,comment,336556,336678,0,0,netcan,,,"You're both right. And this is something that is not emphasised enough. But as with most thorough ideologies, religions & such, their proponents tend to believe that they are the right course of action no matter what angle you look at them from. So from many libertarians' view, it is correct even if you are a consequentialist, utilitarian. etc.<p>I have yet to meet a libertarian that suggests that even though the economic policies are bad for society in a utilitarian sense, they are still morally obliged to support them.<p>Libertarianism is therefore associated with it's utilitarian arguments. They are in every way bar the most theoretical, the foundation of libertarianism.",1224378284

84909,comment,84599,84765,0,0,herdrick,,,"It's a hassle.  Every string displayed in your site (aside from the user created stuff) now becomes a bundle of strings, one for each language.  Also, how are you going to organize the different versions of your site?  Will you just use the same URL for each page and just have some global user language preference that makes each page render accordingly?  Now the smallest change in the text of your site will now require consulting with your translators, which in practice means that you no longer do small changes.  You accumulate lots of changes and send them off to your translators in one chunk, then update them when <i>all</i> the translations get back to you.  Slowing down the iteration cycle can be fatal to a startup.  <p>To avoid this, you can instead maintain a different site for each language and bring your non-English (well, non-whatever you're comfortable with) sites up to date with the English as you do translations.  Now you have forked your code.  <p>Hassle.   ",1196401238

Would people take the time to tag comments? <p>You'd need a way to boil down the answer choices in order to declare a clear cut winner. By boiling it down, you take the personality and shades out gray out of the comment you'd be voting on and therefore much of the value. <p>Also, if the winning side is a ""pro life"" tag and you are pro choice, you are unlikely to see much value or be swayed by the vote. I would see such a vote as dumbed down and dig into the comments for the 'real' content. ",1196400739

84905,comment,84678,84678,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That was incredibly dumb. How would eBay be rewarding investors by ditching a lucrative, growing segment of its business? The synergy between the two is incredible (as is the lack of synergy between eBay and Skype) so as a shareholder, that would be the last thing I'd want.<p>Also Amazon's business must be pretty defensible, because competitors like buy.com and overstock seem to be getting nowhere. Reputation is worth a lot for an online retailer.",1196399263

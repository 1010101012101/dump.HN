19609,comment,19446,19446,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I've heard this a lot, particularly on the old reddit, and it never really fit with my experience. I was told that I was precocious from when I was about three. I was never particularly risk-averse academically; I sought out books and courses at the highest level I could, which was sometimes too high. I skipped into courses up to five years ahead of where I was officially, and probably didn't do quite as well as I could have, but I wanted to know it NOW, dammit! I have learned to be somewhat risk-averse because I have been trying to optimize admissions chances to various places, but other than consciously doing that, I've never noticed myself shying away from difficult things.

19604,comment,19585,19585,0,0,ereldon,,,"I can see this... but the best way to judge whether such bias exists (and is also a bad thing) is by looking at the success or failure of our startups, right? The free market ain't perfect, but it's better than most other methods of deciding value. This point assumes that we take each other's advice here ;)<p>Also, I recall a BBC article a while back citing a study showing that ~half of all scientific studies turn out wrong because they failed to exclude variables. The study, below, needs to be supported by other studies in other circumstances (and maybe those exist -- I don't read psy journals).",1178323312

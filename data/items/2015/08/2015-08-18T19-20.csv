They could have made that part of the convention registration, and they would have been OK (though they would almost certainly have faced an outcry).

This means that rather than wondering if a given client supports some feature, or has some emoticon set installed and turned on, you know <i>exactly</i> how the client behaves and can implement features faster as a result. The configurability, flexibility, and client choice that XMPP offers appear to be drawbacks rather than advantages.

You can drag it out of sight to the customizable UI holding area, and the code is lazy-loaded, so it&#x27;s pretty much gone. One could also argue that any extension isn&#x27;t gone because one can open the addons page and install it again. Yes, that&#x27;s different and the addons page is on the Internet while customizeable UI isn&#x27;t, but it illustrates the point that &quot;completely remove&quot; is nebulous and not a useful metric. For all practical purposes, you can remove Pocket. Does it matter if there&#x27;s still Pocket related code in the Firefox binary? (which isn&#x27;t being run or even accessed?)

I would prefer the above, and to be honest my knowledge of databases is not strong enough to say that the below makes it impossible or difficult to implement but something that needs to be taken into account.<p>Spotify currently has a database that tracks the number &#x27;Plays&#x27; each artist gets. They then roll that up into a combined number that gives them their royalty payout for the year. Have lets say 100,000 artists, that is 100,000 records accessed when they run their end of year report. On the user level (lets say you have a million users) you now need to keep track of the number of clicks per artist per user. Most likely through having each user have its own click counter table that has a record for each artist they listened to (probably through a foreign key) and then the number of clicks for that artist. When the end of the year report rolls around instead of simply looking at 100,000 records. You are now accessing 1 million records times the average number of artists a user listens too and then running calculations to figure out how much each artist gets by the user. I&#x27;m sure there is better database design then the above mentioned but you still run into a more power intensive process to calculate it.<p>Not something I think will completely stop companies like spotify from switching to this model but something worth considering...",1439925213

Instead, IBM dominates the market and we know S/360 architecture was optimized for performance not security. That along with IBM backward compatibility seems to be how it won. The obscurity of almost every aspect of it along with barrier-to-entry is why it got less scrutiny.<p>So, it all adds up to a platform that should be very easy to smash and have literally decades worth of vulnerabilities built in. Should be some horrid design decisions in there, too, which might not be just a patch job. Mainframe hacking is literally a goldmine people should get into.

But I still don&#x27;t understand the point you&#x27;re trying to make.<p>But even if markets were more honest, it is still not good enough argument to have them. War may also make people more honest but it&#x27;s not a reason to have it either.<p>> People who try to lie in markets don&#x27;t do well.<p>I wish it would be true. You probably come from the U.S., which has an extremely strong culture of fairness (although it slowly weakens), expressed in its justice system. But in other nations, this culture is not strong. The problem is that markets cannot really punish anybody; once you successfully cheated, you get more money. If you have been found out, you at most lose a little bit of investment (and a mark, but those are dime a dozen). You can generally start another company with different name and continue with dishonesty. In other words, I don&#x27;t consider losing a good job or opportunity to be a punishment; it&#x27;s just a bad luck.<p>> How many Bernie Madoff stories are there? Not many.<p>In Czechoslovakia, shortly after the Velvet Revolution, there were many. The justice system didn&#x27;t understand the new economic system and wasn&#x27;t capable to deal with cheaters. Our prime minister, Vaclav Klaus, had the opinion - free markets are of primary importance and the justice system is secondary. What happened during the era (before we passed enough laws to be compatible with EU) was just huge &quot;gold rush&quot; of embezzlement.",1446363978

Randomly a ball would be kicked for any reason, maybe.<p>I was 20 years old before I figured out that the basic rules of the game were 4 tries to move the ball 10 yards from the &quot;line of scrimage&quot; before the other team gets an opportunity to do the opposite.

Capitalism is really about the pre-eminence of capital (it&#x27;s right there in the name).<p>Treating the labor market as an undifferentiated commodity to be exploited is one way in which the needs of those who own capital (capitalists/rentiers) are placed above those who are part of that labor market.

There is no influential left-wing equivalent of Fox&#x27; propaganda, by far the leading cable news channel, the Wall St Journal editorial page (the NY Times isn&#x27;t nearly as partisan), or of right-wing talk radio (Limbaugh, etc.). For example, the Tea Partiers in Congress refuse to respect that their fellow citizens should have a say in the nation&#x27;s laws and oppose everything that doesn&#x27;t go exactly their way.

Two in particular: firstly, it assumes some kind of simple relationship, so that if person X buys 10 apples for $100, then they valued each apple at $10 (linear), or maybe the first at $50, the second at 25$, etc. (polynomial). There is however no irrefutable logical justification for the assumption, e.g. perhaps they valued the first at $30, the second at $1, the third at $4, the fourth at $5.

Win32 was one such subsystem; users were exposed to the Win32 API, and weren&#x27;t supposed to talk directly to the intentionally undocumented NT API (although some developers did reverse-engineer it eventually). POSIX and OS/2 compatibility was implemented as subsystems, but these were rarely used by anyone, and eventually removed in XP. DOS was not a subsystem, but rather its own thing.<p>Note that this has nothing to do with microkernels. In a microkernel architecture, things like file systems and device drivers live run as normal processes separate from the kernel. In NT, everything was in the kernel. These subsystems didn&#x27;t act as part of a microkernel design.<p>Oh, and NT was not a rewrite of OS/2. It was written from scratch.

You need a Customer Relations Manager, aka Account Manager.<p>The problem is that company execs conflate phone support for the masses with phone support for those upon whom valuable business is conducted.  The problem with phone support for the masses is that there is a vocal minority who waste considerable phone support resources due to their ignorance, stupidity, reluctance to read anything or even attempt to understand anything.  Anybody who has worked on phone support will tell stories, often over beers, about &quot;customers&quot; ringing up and abusing them for situations which basically stem from them not reading even the most rudimentary &quot;READ THIS FIRST&quot; material.<p>Instead of having a robotic voice answer your calls with &quot;your call is important to us&quot; it would be great if companies actually acted acted in a manner consistent with their core value of &quot;Your business is important to us&quot; and the more business you give them, the more they show that you are important to them.  <i>Actions do speak louder than words.</i>",1372132674

I just don&#x27;t think anyone really felt the pain until the Task Parallel Library came along in .NET 4.  Since the TPL API is lambda heavy people really started using lambdas for asynchronous tasks, which leads (or used to lead, anyway) to pain and misery when using a loop iteration variable.<p>It could always be worse, though.  Look at JavaScript.  Simply copying the loop variable in the body of the loop doesn&#x27;t work because all variables are scoped at the function level.  So your &quot;local&quot; loop variable is actually a single instance for the entire function and you have the same exact problem.  Instead, you have to actually create another function and immediately execute it with the loop iteration variable as an argument, and then use the parameter within the function to do whatever you wanted to do.

With chef, for example, the idea is to put all the configuration for a single application in one &quot;cookbook&quot; and then if you have two different servers that both use that application in different ways, you define two different roles that pass different parameters to the basic recipes.  Obviously the extent to which this one a benefit depends somewhat on your needs and personal preferences.<p>But I do agree that both chef and puppet are over-engineered.  Puppet&#x27;s DSL and chef&#x27;s server are mostly overkill that I don&#x27;t have much use for.  But the DSL can be dealt with and the chef server is optional.

Second, even if they&#x27;re dealing with a <i>mostly</i> static platform, I&#x27;m sure there would be some changes -- in hardware, replacing components with newer/cheaper ones, and in software, patching security vulnerabilities -- so there would still be some incentive to make merging easy (although not as much as if they were continuing development, to be sure).<p>Of course, for all I know, they might be planning a PlayStation 5 based on FreeBSD 11.0 to be launched in 2017, in which case they would have very good reasons to merge as much non-proprietary work upstream.",1372130126

This is technically a breaking change, although it is really hard to think of a case where the old behavior was legitimately desired.<p>Consider (stolen from the spec doc):<p><pre><code>  int[] values = { 7, 9, 13 };\n  Action f = null;\n  foreach (var value in values)\n  {\n      if (f == null) f = () => Console.WriteLine(&quot;First value: &quot; + value);\n  }\n  f();\n</code></pre>\nIn previous versions of C#, there is a single value variable is in the scope of the entire loop, so the above code would actually print out the last value in the list because that was the value of value (sorry) when the loop finished.  In C# 5.0, a value variable is actually in the scope of each individual iteration (so within the braces).  So now if you use your iteration variable in a closure scope it won&#x27;t change on you when the loop iterates and the above code actually prints out the first value.<p>The same cannot be said for a for loop.

No need to use `var taht = this` if you have nested functions.<p>* The metatable system is much more flexible than the simple JS prototypal inheritance system (you can sort of implement &quot;method missing&quot; instead of being forced to only delegate to a concrete table.<p>* You can use anything as a Lua table key. In JS all keys are converted to strigns. Lua also supports weak references.<p>* Coroutines! Its sort of like ES6 generators and is super awesome.

To make matters worse, though we made several attempts to contact them we got zero help.  I did eventually contact a staffer via Twitter who told me &#x27;someone was looking into it&#x27; but that was it.  So we spent the day checking email, twitter, and logs looking for some sort of sign that we&#x27;re back up.  Not fun...<p>Putting aside we were down for a day, and the fact we&#x27;ve done around .5M of business with them so far this year, we have no way of contacting them via phone.<p>I&#x27;ve been a champion of the concept of not providing phone support, instead use email - providing email is fast and reliable.  However, after today I&#x27;m having second thoughts.<p>Over the last few years I&#x27;ve seen more and more substantially successful companies not offering phone support.  This idea has been interesting to me as I think its not only cool but efficient.<p>For instance, in many cases phone support may be just a place for a customer to take out their frustrations, not really helping matters or delivering a solution any quicker.  In my experience I often can help people out quicker via email because it saves me the emotional drama.<p>However, I think in order for this to be successful, email or web chat support needs to be efficient.  I&#x27;m talking turn-around time in minutes not hours or worse yet days.<p>Even if a solution can&#x27;t be resolved quickly, a customer should be notified that the issue is being worked on.  Metaphorically speaking, not doing such is like not providing a spinner or progress bar when doing a lengthy web request.  It builds tension - tension needs resolved.<p>That being said - more companies seem to be doing this.  I&#x27;m asking the HN community on their opinion of this trend.

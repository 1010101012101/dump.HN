Note that the line between destructive cults and other groups are not only blurry, but some cults may morph into a normal group over time, or vice versa.  <p>If you really suspect a certain group is a cult and want to do something about it in a short span, watch a concrete prediction the group makes (somehow lots of cult leaders often makes them, e.g. the world will end by year 20XX).  Then compare the outcome.  Don't be destructed by what the member of the groups says, or how the group is organized and managed.  Look for the objective evidence.\n",1189239366

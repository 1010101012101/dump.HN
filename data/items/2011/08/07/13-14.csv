Way back in 2003, I remember being struck by how brilliant the name NETflix was.  If I'd had the idea for DVDsByMail, I would have opened DVDsByMail.com   Hastings was smart enough to call the company NETflix, which works fine for DVDs by mail, but really shines as the name of a streaming media company.<p>So, I find it hilarious to see people writing him off presuming he didn't have a streaming media plan. It is in the name!<p>Also, Linus shouldn't matter.  I've met him. He's a decent guy, and that he ""doesn't matter"" in the way Steve Jobs <i>does</i> matter, is a good thing.

What matters is that it applied to the final invoice and that <IANAL> nonpayment of an invoice is explicitly listed as a breach of contract and grounds to terminate it </IANAL>.<p>I typically use language in my contracts (not programming related) which allows a very short window for payment - seven to ten days not 30 days. That way it is much easier to avoid getting upside down with even a fairly small retainer relative to project size. I also set the interest rate to be higher than many credit cards - at least 1.5% per 28 days - because I am not a bank for my clients. Finally, I will often invoice every two weeks or twice a month - again to avoid being upside down.<p>With established companies, I am more flexible if I feel it is warranted.

I've heard that until then, the Democrats were the big-government social conservatives, and the republicans were the more socially liberal big-business northerners. The whole ""religious right"" thing is kinda new. That said, Murdoch isn't a new conservative, by any stretch of the imagination.<p>But don't try telling a Republican <i>or</i> a Democrat.",1312722660

But it's not just about the superior analysis of the investors, it's about their superior access to information. The idea that two simple, broadly available pieces of information (investors taking money out and completely transparent, though non-traditional accounting practices) are obviously disqualifying and yet people with strong track records are investing huge amounts of money makes me suspicious.<p>There are other signals of silliness here, most conspicuously the comparison to Madoff and Ponzi Schemes. It's link bait; even if Groupon is being manipulative with their accounting, they're still providing a real service to real people. They're providing value to businesses and customers. If their argument was about the sustainability of the model, or even just about the justification behind recent valuations, that would be something I'd be more interested in approaching in the way you describe.<p>I guess I wasn't aware that HN's limitations on ideal discourse are so severe. I figured there might be a way to add value by getting some perspective about the implications of this argument and their improbability.",1312722065

Whatever reason you are not able to execute it, thats an indication of where you have to plug holes in your skill set, either by learning yourself or developing relationships with somebody who is strong in that area.<p>If you keep executing and keep plugging the holes in your skill set, you will have the fastest learning curve that no college education can provide by itself.<p>Do complete your college education, it does teach a lot of good basics on different useful stuff and its a great backup in case things don't work out with the business end by the time you complete education. But thats what it gives - basics, useful basics, basics that are not enough for anything but an entry level job.<p>College education + loads of experience by the time you complete education = killer resume.<p>This is from a guy who has done his fair share of education and waited too long to go after his dream ( of course, not too long to let the dream die or go after it now :))<p>Good luck.<p>(edit:   If you start the action part now, you will also attract a network of friends and teachers who appreciate a person like you and can probably help you.

1749446,comment,1747756,1748009,0,0,scrollinondubs,,,"Yes.  We had rolled out a Devpay-backed product called ""Cloud Gear"" about a year ago and ended up pulling it off the shelf due primarily to two irreconcilable issues:\n1. their accounting process appeared to have some fundamental innacuracies at the time. We tracked the launching of instances and our numbers did not match up with theirs. There was anomalous usage behavior and Amazon eventually admitted there had been tracking glitches on their end - difficult to deliver a service if the underlying accounting can't be trusted.  Note: this may have been (likely has been) remedied since but it was problematic around January '10.\n2. As another commenter noted, the signup process for a newcomer was too much to ask of someone who didn't already happen to have an AWS account.  And even for those who did it was still a cumbersome hamster maze to put them through and undoubtedly hurt the adoption numbers.<p>#1 has likely been resolved. #2 is inherent to this type of on-behalf-of arrangement. It is an interesting model and could definitely enable some innovative services. We just found it not ready for primetime when we had tested it back in late '09-early'10.",1285984559

So the only option to pay your bills and rent is to do consulting on the side or VC money (which I personally don’t believe in).<p>During school you have time to network, take advice from your professors (many of them are entrepreneurs themselves), and you have enough time to learn if your idea will work or not. I don’t say you will have tons of time to build a facebook while in school but you can build a prototype (version 0.1) and see if that will work.<p>I really like this idea “Join an early stage accelerator program like YCombinator or TechStars” because here you meet people who are also in the same state of mind as you are.

Unfortunately, the video fast-forwards through that bit. The way the cashier looks at the cameraman suggests that there was some human assistance there.<p>My point is that encoding probabilities about locations isn't enough. When the robot knew that the fridge was a probable place for a sandwich, it also knew how to open the door of the fridge, and that this was a required action to obtain a sandwich in that location. ""Open the fridge door and look for a sandwich"" is analogous to ""Talk to the cashier and order a sandwich"", but it seems like the robot can't do that yet. Subway also sells drinks, and if the person had asked for a drink, and subway had been found to be a probable location for a drink, the actions needed at the subway would need to be different to get a drink rather than a sandwich.<p>It's cool research, and very useful, but it's worth pointing out that this robot can't yet actually fetch a sandwich from subway unassisted.",1318105610

6662157,comment,6654531,6660492,1,0,derleth,,,"> the idea that government is the sole entity that can be relied upon to solve it, as claimed earlier post<p>I presented my argument wrong. My position is that the government is the only entity that can be relied upon to solve it <i>entirely</i>, not the only one that can be relied upon to <i>help</i> solve it. Private entities are too small to institute the broad changes needed to solve this, as has been demonstrated in the past, when they had the chance and failed.<p>My complaint was against the people who are convinced that the government must not be involved in any of this at all, because Socialism Is Evil.<p>> But what actually happened? The government was shut down briefly, then all went back to as it was. The GOP looked like even bigger fools.<p>The GOP only looks foolish to the people who were against it to begin with. They look like Brave Freedom Fighters to the people who voted them in, and will vote for them again in 2014, simply because they stood up to the Black Muslim Fascist Socialist (who is Black, by the way).<p>> Yes, but my belief (clearly not argued well, I concede) is that many times things get halted because the majority has, for political reasons, decided to acquiesce, not because they lack the means to overcome the resistance of the minority.<p>If the non-Tea-Party majority of the GOP in the House decided to risk being primaried <i>en masse</i> they could, indeed, kill the Ted Cruz contingent. I agree with you there, sure. But that&#x27;s an extremely hard road to follow; it&#x27;s a classic Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma, something right out of a game theory textbook, and politicians are trained to be risk-averse. (Which, in other scenarios, can be a good thing.)<p>> even if the government, in the abstract, has the means to accomplish something in practice they cannot be relied on to do it, because of political self-interest (including, for example, being beholden to their campaign financial sources)<p>And here is where I disagree with the Libertarians (including the Tea Party, which are Libertarian on this issue): The Libertarians say that if the government isn&#x27;t perfect, it can never be part of the solution. I say that if the government isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s time to improve the government.",1383451094

It was my only high speed option at that time.  Actually, to be fair, it was I think at that time Ameritech, which subsequently fairly quickly got sucked into SBC, which is what AT&T really is, now.  (SBC bought the &quot;shell&quot; of AT&T some years back, that included perhaps principally the name and branding.  All of the old AT&T &quot;substance&quot; had long since been hollowed out.)<p>Placing the order took less than 10 minutes.  The call was answered, by a live customer service rep, within a minute.<p>Accomplishing the installation took three half-day appointments (they wouldn&#x27;t provide a narrower window).  They simply blew off the first two.<p>The third appointment resulted in bare connections hanging on the side of my building.  The third party contractor they sent reused some old, old wires someone had left hanging there and didn&#x27;t even bother to wrap the splices.<p>(Fortunately, my downstairs neighbor was friends with a real, honest to goodness union lineman for the voice side of their operations, who was over visiting subsequently and cleaned things up a bit as a personal favor to my neighbor.)<p>Their network was for shit.  tracert would show requesting bouncing through sometimes over a dozen of their servers before even making it out onto the wider Net.  And it got to the point of going down at least once a week.<p>One time, I spent a half hour or so on the phone just talking with and calming down one of their contracted &quot;service&quot; reps, who was so frustrated that she was quitting her job the following week and going back to Maine.  She was nice, and straightforward, and with a good sense of humor, so I didn&#x27;t mind taking the time.<p>She told me that, in her contract position, all she could do was file a ticket.  She couldn&#x27;t even examine the status of an already-filed ticket.  Even for them, the subsequent repair process was a black box.<p>I guess I should add that a call for service (e.g. those weekly network dropouts, for example) took, at a guestimate, on average about 30 minutes to get out of queue and reach a person.  During this time, <i>sales</i> calls (calling the number to order service) continued to be answered almost immediately.   Priorities could hardly be clearer.<p>Add to this the 700+ million in tax breaks and subsidies that SBC (now AT&T) received in return for committing to universal high speed Internet access in this state.  Whereupon, they turned around and immediately deployed and hired lawyers and lobbyists to get them out of their half of the deal while keeping the incentives.<p>Their lawsuits and lobbying against any and all attempts of municipalities to deploy their own networks, most often only after AT&T has refused to provide said service themselves.<p>On and on...<p>Anything that keeps them from growing further?

As long as the rulers behave decently, things work well. When they don&#x27;t, things fall apart. The Soviet Union had the most democratic constitution ever  and it meant nothing. The people &quot;in charge&quot; in the US have decided to behave like swine, on everything from ignoring swathes of the Bill of Rights to not talking to each other about policy. No amount of Constitutional rewriting will help with that.<p>To use an analogy near and dear to the HN readership: you can use the best language, framework, and source control system, but that won&#x27;t help if you have incompetent programmers who do not communicate.",1383447784

Ever since moving to Denmark, I have not been missing the bureaucratic mess that is the American health-insurance system. Also, much stuff here is built in-house by competent civil servants, not bid out to private-sector contractors like the ones who screwed up healthcare.gov (though that is, alas, somewhat changing).<p>I do think streamlining things would be nice. A large but simple government: everyone gets automatic healthcare coverage by right (like Medicare, but without age limits), everyone gets a basic income rather than some complex web of welfare, etc. Less bureaucracy and maybe even smaller government in terms of pages of regulation/etc., but larger &quot;size&quot; of government in the percent-of-GDP sense.<p>The American approach seems to prefer complex but low-benefit government, with huge piles of eligibility rules and private-sector provision, instead of just simple blanket benefits.",1383447644

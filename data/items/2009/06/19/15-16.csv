If you've got a designer/developer that is incompetent (or just out of practise) then they are going to take a lot longer and so cost more. Agree a price, technical problems are the designers problem.<p>Admin stuff takes quite a lot of time in a small business, in my experience (3 small businesses so far). Also just doing the design implementation stuff isn't enough - you do have to get out and win the work. 50:50 sounds about right IMO.<p>That's assuming he is doing inital design (graphical prototype, you'll need usability input here) and preparing graphical elements for the coded pages; as well as the up front promotion and sales.<p>Kinda depends on what sort of sites you're doing. A heavy app with lots of DB design or lots of scripting would need more weighting towards you. A simple graphical ""this is us"" site the weight is more towards him (and you're probably better outsourcing the coding of that sort of thing anyway).<p>FWIW",1245427188

That is my review after finishing the first chapter, which is as far as I've got.<p>The ""Basic Training"" perspective peeks through in comments like:<p>""Trigonometric functions, identities and derivatives, radian measures for angles.  These will not be listed here since you must have already learned them by heart as a child.""<p>So don't expect to be overly molly-coddled by this book.<p>I'm reading it for many of the same reasons you describe.  Taking a machine learning course in the Fall, want to brush up on the underlying mathematics involved.  Statistics, calculus and linear algebra are pervasive in most of the ML books I have looked at.  I note that you did not list linear algebra, but that is the area where I have been spending the most time, mainly because I never took a course in it, where the other topics I have at least some background I can review.",1245427076

665233,comment,664918,665085,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"The trick behind a fair and effective penalty for a crime is that there both has to be a realistic expectation of actual enforcement (there's no way a person can afford to pay $80k for a song unless their last name rhymes with Mates or Muffet, even if caught), and the expected value has to be obviously negative under most circumstances--that is, the probability of being caught times the expense must be much more negative than the value gained by committing the crime.<p>We can see this principle at work in the fines for things such as littering, illegal parking, and drunk driving.  Individual instances of these crimes gain a person a small amount of value; the fines for being caught are around one or two orders of magnitude greater than this (at first--often repeat offenses raise the expense another order of magnitude in the form of either jail time or increased insurance costs), in line with the approximation of being caught a non-negligible fraction of the time.<p>By comparison, illegal file sharing has a vanishingly small chance of getting your life completely destroyed.  The problem with this is two fold.  First, it isn't at all calculable what the expected value is; there simply isn't enough data to accurately determine what the probability of getting caught from any single illegal act is.  Second, the enforcement rate is sufficiently low that, even if it were reliably calculable, people would not emotionally treat it correctly--the same emotional detachment from strongly negative consequences occurs here as the one that makes people take other sorts of extreme risks such as teenage unprotected sex, extreme sports, and going to war as a foot soldier (note that I am not saying that these always have negative expected value; merely that people are not good at estimating these sorts of risks).<p>The problem the RIAA faces is that enforcement to the degree necessary for a lower level fine to create sufficiently negative expected value is a practical impossibility; there's no reasonable way to effectively catch and fine even 1% of file-sharers (a rough estimate of what order of magnitude of enforcement is necessary to make people effectively able to gauge the risk--such an enforcement rate would not stop illegal file sharing altogether, but it would at least slow it down, much like my other examples).

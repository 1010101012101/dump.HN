If Los Angeles can do it with Metrolink (which similarly runs on existing track), Houston <i>should</i> be able to do it, but I'm not holding my breath. I believe there's substantial demand; the park-n-ride lots for the downtown express buses from Clear Lake have been completely overflowing for the past few years, as driving on I-45 has gotten less appealing with the ever-increasing traffic.<p>I do see more construction nearer to the center, at least. There are condos and townhomes in the Medical Center area that were abandoned and/or slums 10 years ago.",1334530794

Improved traffic flow helps with both -- no stop and go means no energy wasted to braking, and automated car trains will allow cars to take turns drafting off one another for a significant reduction in drag.<p>Notice that cars have markedly different highway vs. city mileage ratings.  The old BMW I used to drive would get better than 26 (not great by today's standards) on an open freeway, but 17-18 in city traffic due to repeated acceleration and idling.

3845054,comment,3844820,3844981,2,0,dkrich,,,"I think it depends upon what you define as ""first."" The iMac wasn't the first computer in the sense that it wasn't the first machine with a keyboard, mouse, and operating system. But it was the first along many important dimensions including beautiful packaging and marketing, great software, etc. that are very difficult to pull off for companies attempting to create replicas (just look at how hard HP is trying to rip off the Macbook Pro). I think being first is absolutely important if you define first as being the first to create a well-executed specific product offering within a larger category. In many ways this sums up the evolution of products- one comes along that does things differently and much better than its predecessors. That in my opinion is what has made Apple so successful over the past decade- they have been the first in phones, desktops, laptops, tablets, and music sales along several very important dimensions.",1334530226

These things historically have shifted in many cities, in respond to a wide range of things like housing stock.<p>For example, in NYC the center has gentrified; most of the slummy areas of Manhattan are now desirable to live in. While areas that used to be quiet and suburban in Queens and the Bronx have ended up being sketchy, in a sort of inversion. In most of Europe that's also happened; if you can help it, you don't want to send your kid to a school district in the Paris suburbs, if there's any way you can manage to get them into a good urban district.<p>As a different example, Houston is developing into a strange multiple-rings shape. The city center is gentrifying (medical center, Rice area, downtown), while the inner suburbs are going downhill as the housing stock gets older (60s/70s-construction suburban neighborhoods aren't looking so good anymore), and then <i>really</i> far away suburbs with newer construction (20+ miles, 1990s-present housing stock) are upscale again.",1334530002

A scheduled trip on your rent-a-car share may well take you to a dynamically-scheduled bus that will aggregate many people's trips. Also, the car you call will be only as powerful as it needs to be, so you won't be routinely driving around in an SUV when all you need is an efficient sedan for a given trip. Electric cars work much better in this environment, because they can easily either go charge up or do battery exchange on a commercial-fleet scale instead of at a neighborhood gas station.<p>Personally, I'm also pretty sure the net effect of self-driving cars will also be to spread out the suburbs even more too. Most people imagine self-driving cars that are still owned by you and have single-owner use patterns, but the economics of that don't work; in nothing flat owners start renting their car out during their off times, AirBnB style, and it's a short hop from there to simply providing cars as a service. Somebody is going to get very rich being the somebody who wins on the network effects and creates ""the"" transportation-as-a-service company.

At least right now I think Amazon is the lesser evil.<p>The publishers may be more than one, but they are acting like a monopoly anyway (or oligopoly if you will) by trying to price ebooks a lot higher than they should cost. I don't care if they do it through the agency model, the wholesale model or the whatever model. The point is they are doing it, and at least Amazon was trying to bring the price down with the $9.99 price tag, and with the $1-$3 Singles, even if that's forcing the publishers' hand.<p>For anyone out there still thinking the publishers weren't colluding - just think of it this way - no big publisher would've tried to price the ebooks $15 if the others didn't agree to do it as well. Also Apple wouldn't have agreed to have $15 prices for its books, unless the publishers forced Amazon to have the same prices, too.<p>If the publishers are so worried about Amazon, maybe they should stop giving them so much power themselves as a gatekeeper by asking them to use DRM.

Knowing that people will consume my cookies in large quantities if I give them away is a long way from creating a successful, sustainable business out of the popularity of my free cookies. I'm sure my cookies are important to the people to whom I am giving them, but does that mean that I can monetize my free cookies in ways other than charging for the cookies? I doubt it. But let's be honest, that's exactly what we're talking about here- giving away a useful service with the assumption that I can make money by doing something else related to the service in the future.

I say rails because this seems to be the main driver behind Ruby's growth.<p>Rails seems to work magically for first-timers and without knowing what's happening it allows anyone to build sophisticated web applications. It basically expects you to have faith it will work and as such perhaps it creats a faith based following.<p>What the author is describing is all sympthomatic of many religious groups :)",1334527862

But they seem like cool guys, and they'll probably figure it out.<p>Meteor and (I believe) Derby simply don't have this this security issue; it's obvious from the design that they don't, it's a major selling point on Meteor's website that they won't, and the Meteor dev's have explained it in detail.  They've even explicitly stated what was already pretty damn clear: There is no ability to drop a database (or similar) from a Meteor client.<p>In short, Meteor and Derby are both client/server frameworks where the security, validation, and authentication lives on the sever; that is a very well proven design (inasmuch as it's the same used in, you know, every webapp on the planet).  And contrary to the parents comment, they <i>DO NOT EXPOSE THEIR DATABASE API TO THE CLIENT</i>.<p>So the reason people are ignoring the question (and downvoting you) is that you are talking about Meteor (and Derby), and those concerns obviously do not apply.  If you want to argue about Firebase's security, you should feel free, but this isn't really the place to do it.  :)",1334527782

There is one basic rule for all businsses: solve a problem that is important to someone.  Wanting your phone's pictures to look better turns out to be a valuable problem for many people.  One nice thing about the enterprise space is that there is a tradition of paying for things of value.  But instagram's lack of paying users does not imply a lack of value being added.  And there's almost always a way to monetize a product that is important to someone.<p>Perhaps a more direct message from this article could have been: ""Just because you target consumers doesn't mean you can avoid solving an important problem"".  Consumer products fail for the same reason enterprise ones do: their products are not important to anyone.",1334527604

7169723,comment,7169572,7169572,4,0,adrianhoward,,,"In my personal experience (UK and EU mostly):<p>* 100% remote working is rare<p>* Flexitime  around core hours is relatively common<p>* Remote working from the start is very rare. Most employers want you on site to absorb the company culture and gel with the team before they would consider remote working. You need to show that you&#x27;re effective and productive first.<p>* Companies measuring outcomes rather than effort - non-existent outside of the smaller startups.<p>If you want remote work and outcome based companies then currently you need to be looking to the smaller more startup-ish organisations. Which has associated impact on risk and salary. Or you need to get into a suitable position within the organisation to help make the change to more remote/outcome based work yourself.<p>A few things to consider from the employer&#x27;s side:<p>* If you and the employer are in different countries it can add a considerable administration burden on the employer. In many cases they won&#x27;t have the skills in-house so you are asking them to acquire a specialised set of HR skills and knowledge for one hire. This is a tough sell unless you have the answers to that problem to hand.<p>* Something you notice as an employer is that people often mistake their personal productivity with the team productivity. There is quite a lot of evidence that distributed teams are less productive than co-located ones (see <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5145358"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5145358</a> - any <i>research</i> based counter examples very welcome!). You need to have a good argument that remote working will pay off for them.<p>* Running distributed teams well takes effort and skill. You need to adopt new tools, new structures, take more effort on things that &quot;naturally&quot; happen when folk are co-located. Unless a company already has this in place it&#x27;s a lot of effort to make for a single new hire.",1391421076

There was no traditional &quot;account&quot; which Mozilla had to validate. You could also chose to use your own sync server. Either way, they can not peek at your data.<p>You gave Firefox your email and a &quot;password&quot; and from that it generated some private keys used to encrypt the data sent to Mozilla.

7169663,comment,7168936,7169299,9,0,peterhunt,,,"There&#x27;s a few things going on here that combine to cause this mess.<p>First, task runners, like templating systems and module bundlers, are easy to write so there are lots of them. Grunt in particular doesn&#x27;t bring <i>anything</i> to the table that bash scripts don&#x27;t.<p>Second, most open-source projects don&#x27;t make their value prop clear (I learned this the hard way first-hand and I&#x27;m still dealing with it) and most people don&#x27;t have a good rubric to evaluate technologies so they fall back to crappy ones like gzipped size, number of dependencies, or the twitter account of who wrote it. Increasing the level of understanding of performance and how system complexity evolves over time is an important next step for the community to take.<p>For example I think the excitement around Gulp is legit because the tasks are composed as in-memory streams which is a scalable way to build a performant system. Browserify not so much, since it doesn&#x27;t bring anything new to the table except maybe that it&#x27;s so damned easy to use (&quot;philosophy&quot; does not count as bringing something to the table). Webpack, on the other hand is a whole different story since it accepts that static resource packaging (not just single-file JS modularization) is a problem that needs to be tackled holistically and necessitates a certain level of complexity.<p>I named specific projects not because I have any vested interest in them (I don&#x27;t really use Gulp for anything) but because I wanted to show concrete examples of how to evaluate technologies on real merit.<p>Finally, the web frontend community has a huge problem with NIH (not-invented-here) syndrome which is encouraged by npm. For example, there are lots of copycat data binding systems that claim to be &quot;lightweight&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;. They&#x27;re usually written by people that don&#x27;t know about all of the important edge cases which necessitate certain design decisions or library size. It goes the other way too -- a lot of people are building monolithic app frameworks without doing due diligence on existing systems to see if they can be reused.<p>If we can slow down and try to respect what others have done and acknowledge what we may not know, I think we can fix this problem.",1391419916

Because there is no standard module system (and yes I know about CommonJS and AMD loaders, but both have issues), to use a given component you oftentimes have to adapt an entire philosophy of package management that can lock you out of other packaging philosophies. In the end, we have millions of front-end programmers saying, &quot;eh it seems like to much work to integrate this packaging philosophy, I&#x27;ll just write my own duplicate copy/library.&quot; So basically projects silo themselves off and share little code until someone decides on yet another package philosophy (see: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/927/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/927/</a>).<p>People love to write build system after build system, in every field, a fetish I&#x27;ve never quite understood.

7169624,comment,7166431,7166765,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I actually like table inheritance.  However there are all kinds of quite annoying cases about it and it gets misused in many cases.<p><i>What it works for really well</i><p>Table inheritance works really, really well for enforcing consistent interfaces to repeatedly used pieces of information which are independent for referential integrity purposes.  For example, we&#x27;ve all seen horrors involving global notes tables with umpteen join tables....  Inheritance provides a very clean solution to that problem:  have an abstract notes table (which can double for query purposes as a global notes table) and worker tables which have foreign keys which attach specifically to other tables.<p>For example, in LedgerSMB we have a note table, an invoice_note table a eca_note table (notes for customer/vendor agreements), and more.  The nice thing is, the tables all have the same structure and can be managed structure-wise as if they were a single table.<p>For example, an alter table statement on note can affect all sub-tables in many cases (other than unique constraints, primary or foreign keys, etc).  If I want to add a virtual column for full text searching, I can do this with a single function as follows:<p><pre><code>    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tsvector(note) \n    RETURNS tsvector\n    language sql immutable as\n    $$ SELECT to_tsvector($1.subject || &#x27; &#x27; || $1.note); $$;\n</code></pre>\nThen eca_note.tsvector will just work (subject to limitations of this syntactic feature of PostgreSQL).  I could even index the output of the function on any note subtable.<p><i>What It Does Not Work For</i><p>So inheritance is often sold as a way of tracking part/whole relationships and other type/subtype problems.  The problem is that these currently break down where you need referential integrity enforcement across an inheritance tree.  Consequently, while I see inheritance as a really, really useful feature, it is a feature that is largely useless for the problems it was originally intended to solve.  Now, it is getting better (9.2 added NOINHERIT constraints, which allow you to apply different check constraints to parent and child tables, useful if you want to forbid all inserts to the parent table), but the really big problems have to do with the inability to properly inherit unique indexes, and therefore not to referential integrity enforcement against a whole inheritance tree.<p>In general in these cases, you are better off with a single table, and designing a structure without table inheritance to model the information.",1391419155

So i decided to contribute to this dream by making an open-source AI module for NPC to help game developers create amazing games.<p>My idea is to make a Goal-based system. Each NPC would have a set of goals, and would weigh in available actions as to how closer it would take them to their goals. I decided to start of with something simple like &quot;maximize gold&quot; so the NPC would take actions that resulted in most gold increase. i figured if i did it right, the NPC would themsleves figure out paths in action-trees that would let them make more gold. for example, figuring out that making wooden stuff out of logs is more profitable than selling raw wood. Or that if you can afford it, hiring people to make the wooden stuff (like a business/company) is more profitable overall than doing it yourself (cuz of multi-threading, opportunity cost, overall path weight, etc).<p>So it would be cool to see NPC picking out roles themselves, forming in-game societies and behavin in line with their goals. heck maybe someone can make a game that would involve using people&#x27;s goals to influence them",1391419065

They are held and classified as unlawful combatants. There has not been (and will not be) any formal end to hostilities like history has known. Instead, we&#x27;ve seen agreements that say occupations are ending and troops are being withdrawn, but nothing that states hostilities are formally ended and peace is obtained like most people expect to be in place. This has a lot to do with not bothering to be in declared states of war any longer, because that opens states up to massive legal consequences and responsibilities that states, particularly the US over the last 50 years, are particularly interested in avoiding.<p>> <i>What else is the US supposed to do?

And because there are no official peace agreements that will ever be made for a war that was never declared, there is little chance we will ever see these prisoners released at the conclusion of hostilities--because there are no conclusions.

7169561,comment,7168547,7168547,11,0,maggit,,,"&quot;Rap Genius for Code&quot; might be an amazing pitch for avid users of Rap Genius. I wouldn&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know or care exactly what Rap Genius is, even though I remember there was a recent controversy involving Rap Genius. (It&#x27;s got something to do with rap music and lyrics? Not my interest.)<p>If you can explain your site in words that don&#x27;t require very specific domain knowledge, I think that might broaden appeal.<p>I think this way of pitching is dangerous for two reasons:<p>1. Many potential users of the product (Kurikku) will not know about the thing it&#x27;s being defined in relation to (Rap Genius), and will not understand that they should check it out<p>2. Those that <i>do</i> know might make a different comparison than you. I might say &quot;It&#x27;s like Github for music!&quot; and you will think &quot;Oh, so you put in scores and people can collaborate -- just like with code on Github!&quot;, but I was thinking &quot;You store your personal music library in the cloud and you can clone it to all your machines -- just like with code on Github!&quot; While you intend the comparison to be a way to explain a lot with just a few words, in reality it might be interpreted all wrong, giving users entirely unsuitable expectations when checking it out.<p>So, please try to communicate clearly about the thing you have made using every day words. Good luck :)",1391418321

71947,comment,71910,71910,0,0,arete,,,"I rank distributed version control as one of the most significant advancements in software development in the past decade. Why?<p>1. Ease of branching and merging.<p>Branch as often as you want, merge as often as you want, from as many different branches as necessary. The importance of isolating stable releases, bug fixes, experimental features, etc can't be overstated and DVCS makes doing so very easy.<p>2. Offline use.<p>All of the popular DCVS provide full functionality within each local repository/branch/whatever.  Being disconnected won't keep you from branching or merging, which gets back to #1.  It's also very easy to share branches between two laptops for instant mobile collaboration.<p>3. Ease of sharing changes.<p>Most DVCS support easy sending of local changes to a project maintainer.  This really does make it much more likely that a user will grab a copy of the source, make some improvements, and submit those back to the community.  No more messing with diff formats, finding the maintainer's email address, etc.<p>--<p>Of all the DVCS, I recommend mercurial (hg) for the best blend of ease of use, performance, portability, etc.  Darcs is my real favorite, but currently has issues with conflicts.  Bazaar-NG (bzr) looks promising as well.  I avoid git like the plague... far too complex and unwieldy for my taste.",1193197113

My first thought when this became a big problem was not to look for mashups.<p>I didn't even know the Union-Tribune was blogging, I didn't see a link anywhere on the home page because I just came there looking for updates to their map.<p>The map itself is pretty interesting because it makes heavy use of GIS data, which is orthogonal to Web 2.0 cutesyness.",1193196212

A few days later, the thief fired up AOL Instant Messenger on the stolen laptop using my friend's screenname and started chatting, taunting him and so forth.<p>Well, my friend called AOL and the police. AOL cooperated, his IP address and other info was given to the police, the police found out where he was connecting from, and he was arrested. It turns out he was living in a house with 4 other people with arrest warrants.",1193196030
71940,comment,71919,71919,0,0,cstejerean,,,"While I'm not familiar with how to sell to corporations here are some things that can prevent a company from doing business with you (I've worked for several large companies and it's been interesting to watch some of the smaller vendors screw up in interesting ways).<p>1. Some large companies won't deal with you if you aren't profitable or at least well funded. A big concern is what happens if you go out of business. Be prepared to answer that question.<p>2. Some big companies deal with really big data sets, make sure your application can handle it. For example some companies deal with numbers bigger than 32bit integers. Make sure you can handle that.<p>3. Make sure there are no memory leaks in your application. I've seen more than one vendor saying that their product requires daily reboots. That's usually a sign of crappy code and business with decent IT staffs can tell.<p>4. Sometimes being cheaper than the competition is a bad thing. Make sure to have some pricey versions and support plans for companies that feel better when they spend more money.<p>5. Depending on the companies you sell to and the types of products you build you'll get questions about security compliance of your application / service with things like SAS-70, Sarbanes Oxley, etc. This is particularly important if you keep sensitive data and your client is a public company. Some big companies request a right to audit in order to do business with you (which means they have the right to come over to your business and check things out whenever they want). Be prepared to deal with all this mess.<p>Hope that helps.",1193195720

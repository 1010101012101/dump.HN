I feel it to be a mostly unhelpful right to be granting in the consumer software and device market.  Regardless of how I feel about patents, though, an injunction prior to trial presupposes (on some level) that the charged party is guilty enough to warrant forcing them not to trade.<p>Injunctions are often helpful in potential libel cases, where the release of libellous information may cause largely unmeasurable but generally irreversible damages.  I really don't think they're helpful when the extent to which the charged party may benefit <i>is</i> able to be measured (i.e. profit on sales) and the tangible outcome of that benefit redirected to whomever wins the suit (via the court-ordered payment of damages).",1341140881

It works slightly different, first companies like Motorola, Nokia, Samsung and others invested billions of dollars in creating telecommunication standards. Next those companies are forced to license patents for those technologies to Apple. Apple creates phone which base in 95% on technology created by those companies, they are adding several features like ""slide to unlock"" or ""pinch to zoom"" and patent it. Samsung, Motorola and others looks on Apple product and says ""OK, so it means that customers want other UI, we can give them it too"", they are participants in OHA which created very similar to iPhone project of OS for mobile phones (in the same time). So they start to produce and sell such phones. Now Apple goes to court and pretends that theirs big ""innovation"" is so unique that it should let them to block anything similar to theirs ""inventions"" (in the same time Apple took notifications system from Android)... what is the most funny part, Motorola and Samsung must license to Apple patents needed to build cell phone, but Apple may do not license theirs patents.

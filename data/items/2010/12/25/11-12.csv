If you're a start-up, odds are that you have one product, and you can't afford for it to stagnate while it's scrapped and rewritten or while the developers layer hacks on hacks to fix bugs created by the last round of hacks.<p>Even a start-up, though, has tons of code that is not part of the main codebase.  A pile of monitoring scripts, a program that generates an arbitrarily large amount of data for a test database, the company's blog, internal mailing list software, etc.  When you have fewer than 50 employees, it is okay if half of those codebases are ugly hacks.",1293277274

Or want to repurpose some neat and cheap childrens' toy into a spectrum analyzer?<p>Maybe your central heating has a odd habit of keeping your bedroom too hot, and the office too cold even though the thermostat is set correctly?<p>Reverse engineering by itself is just a tool for building things, because once you figured out how something works, the fun begins when you start tinkering it into something the original designers had not forseen.<p>So, to cut this philosophical post short: Get yourself a <i>problem</i> you want to solve, then read all you can about it. If it involves reverse-engineering, e.g. analyzing something not yet documented, you'll have to solve that on the way.<p>And you'll know to ask the specific questions (e.g.: How do I find out the right connection to pins I suspect to be a JTAG port? How can I find out which bits in the serial protocol might stand for what?) when you've come there.",1293277141

Haskell indeed can support width and depth, structural and nominal subtyping. We address the particular challenge to preserve Haskell's type inference even for objects and object-operating functions. Advanced type inference is a strength of Haskell that is worth preserving. Many of the features we get ``for free'': the type system of Haskell turns out to be a great help and a guide rather than a hindrance.""<p>So everyone ""can has"" his OO everywhere, in case one needs it.",1293275519

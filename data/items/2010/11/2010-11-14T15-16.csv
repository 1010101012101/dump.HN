DO NOT SEPARATE knowledge into ""base "" and ""tangential"" especially when you are learning something in a course because many times th so called ""tangential knowledge"" is there to reinforce your ""base knowledge"".<p>I will take an example that you gave. If a student takes Algorithm design class, you would separate the class into the core design principles as ""base"" and the other as ""tangential"". However, the concrete algorithms are there to reinforce the design principles, to describe the abstraction layers that we have built etc. If a student doesn't work hard to learn about the working of the algorithm, he would probably miss out on important aspects like the power of invariance, the power of recurrence, the hurdle in analyzing the recurrence, the nonintuitive correctness of these algorithms. These are all implicit knowledges. The teacher would probably just mention it and move on in the lecture.<p>But the assignments, the problem sets, the midterm, the final exam are there to reinforce all these small lessons that would probably be missed. DO NOT JUDGE HOMEWORKS. As a student you may have no idea about what is important and what is not.

I don't think that will happen soon, but it's certainly happening at a faster rate than I ever thought it would be. This is the kind of question that can have a paralyzing effect however. If you want to provide a mobile gateway to your existing service you should go for it and you should implement to target the phones you expect the majority of your users to be using.<p>It was pointed out earlier, but it bears repeating, plan for what's out there right now.

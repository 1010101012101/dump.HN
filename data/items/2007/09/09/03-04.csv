Tasks are the only things we do on computers, we want to put them front and center instead of obscuring them inside windows and menus and buttons and toolbars.<p>Microsoft is showing an interest in task oriented design with the new Office control panel. It's an enormous improvement over the old interface.<p>I used to have a really good long essay on task oriented design someone wrote around 1995, I'll try and track it down. And if anyone ever wants to discuss an entire task oriented computer environment, email me, it's one of my favorite things to talk about.",1189308523

PG's original point is that a large number of users seem to be voting for Ron Paul stories not because they find the stories interesting and want to read more like them, but because they want to help Ron Paul's campaign or express a political opinion.<p>The intent of reddit is that users vote for posts they find interesting and against posts they find boring. Any situation that leads to posts gaining or losing points based on other criteria is a sign of a flaw in the system.<p>I'm not sure what the solution is. I don't find all Ron Paul articles boring, but I only need to see one article about how Fox News tried to make him look bad, not 30. Some sort of grouping might help. Once they have tags, I think it would help to create a flagging system somewhat similar to Craigslist that would allow users to suggest tags for posts. Once a certain number of users suggest a tag, the tag is added to the post. That way, users could filter out tags they didn't want to see, and override anybody who tries to game the system.",1189307707

What gave FB a marked edge wasn&#x27;t its openness but the fact that it was exclusive:  Harvard, Ivies, selective edus, all edus, general world.<p>For the first few years of its life, Facebook was the place that <i>outiders</i> viewed as more selective and attractive than any other option.  This was a powerful growth hack.<p>My own feeling was that Google had a solid initial nucleating community, mostly technical types but also some creatives (largely designers).  Unfortunately, by opening the floodgates early, one of the larger adopter communities were SEO and marketing types -- not, shall we say, the most engaging party animals.  The turn came early.<p>I also feel that G+ really didn&#x27;t start getting its feet under it until ~February/March 2013.  Search had been incorporated, there was a growing wealth of content that could be found.  I made several posts aimed largely at G+ staff about the value of search-driven and directed navigation rather than streams (I&#x27;ve deleted those along with most of my content).<p>Unfortunately subsequent changes (the May, 2013 UI redesign) negated many positive effects.  One telling post a month or so later from Circlescope showed a marked drop in engagement following that release.  I continued to fight for it but watching increasingly passive-aggressive demands for my personal information (phone number, integrated YouTube account) were just pumping up the creep-out factor.<p>Overall I do agree with you on UI/UX -- G+ is pretty awful in that regard.",1399146897

7692141,comment,7690885,7692123,2,0,dekhn,,,"Yes, I have looked into why the Python has a GIL.  I&#x27;ve even written C interface code which released the GIL and then reacquired it when necessary (I know a ton about this, having spent too many of the last 20 years integrating C and python).  Yeah, I actually know what the tradeoffs are and can evaluate them (I used to work with the author of IronPython).<p>you have several choices for C integration in Python.  SWIG, which is now generally considered a huge mess, hand-wrapping, which is a tedious pain, and dlopen/dlsym methods that talk to the C api direectly (which requires something like GCCXML to handle type recognition for complicated APIs).<p>I don&#x27;t think PyPy&#x27;s approach to transactional memory is the right direction either.<p>In short: multithreading on multicore machines is how you write performant software in industry.  The hardware is designed for, the compilers are designed for it, and if you don&#x27;t take advantage of it, you&#x27;re just wasting machines.<p>Now people could argue that multiprocessing addresses it, but it&#x27;s just message passing between different process spaces, which while a wonderful and powerful tool, is ultimately just more cumbersome (hey, I used to write big MPI/OpenMP apps that did both models at the same time).<p>Anyway, the ultimate existence proof is that IronPython was both faster serially <i>and</i> in parallel, without the GIL, than CPython.  So basically we <i>know</i> it&#x27;s possible.  The Python developers have no will, inclination, or ability to make it so,.",1399146678

Have you actually looked into why Python has a GIL? It&#x27;s a pretty clear trade-off, I think.

7692118,comment,7691241,7691507,6,0,saurik,,,"I will also point out that one does not need a registered trademark to have trademark rights in many countries, and this is certainly the case in the US: the issue is that trademarks are a protection not just for the owner, but almost more primarily for potential consumers; it is effectively a protection against people using familiarity and naming to confuse users into affiliations that don&#x27;t exist. The concept of a trademark then only requires demonstrating that in your field (as trademarks are always scope limited: if one came across a laundry-mat named Knol it would not be the same issue) the name carries expectation: that people would recognize it and associate it with a specific party.<p>It also must be stressed that it is <i>not</i> sufficient to have a disclaimer: the user even getting to your website to even see the disclaimer is effectively already under false pretenses, and not everyone reads those messages anyway.

But there are various &#x27;cheats&#x27; mp3 DJs can use which vinyl DJs can&#x27;t whilst mixing.  A lot of MP3 mixing hardware now comes with auto-beatmatch functionality.  I see this being used quite a bit.  It tends to sound pretty soulless, because there&#x27;s no &#x27;liveness&#x27; to it, it&#x27;s very mechanical.  Another is looping the bars at the end of a track to make it easier to mix, with vinyl if you run out of time you just get silence!<p>Still, the main thing is playing the right music in the right order, if you can make it from one track to another without f*cking up then you&#x27;ll have 95% of the room on your side.  The other 5% will the trainspotters that take everything far too seriously anyway.",1399143829

I would also add that it&#x27;s not just about the <i>act</i> of self-selection, but the way the communities are viewed in themselves.<p>Exactly the same qualities are described in very different terms, e.g. a tight knit community which upholds their traditions and values in the face of modernity, vs inbred, ignorant bigots.<p>The main difference between my viewpoint and others who make similar arguments, is that I&#x27;m not saying this is an actual contradiction.  There are many differences in context which mean that the two cannot be directly compared.  However, there is what I would call a discrepancy.  The author of this piece never made a logical argument, that what is good for White communities isn&#x27;t good for others.  He simply painted a picture, which many people might find compelling.  If I can expose this discrepancy, people might find these narratives less compelling.",1399143802

For the most part any &quot;biologic&quot; drug that might need to be personalized is most likely going to be 99% common &quot;boilerplate&quot; plus 1% or less &quot;personalization&quot;.  For example, antibodies, which have a massive common region plus a small amount of variable region that is an &#x27;adapter&#x27; to whatever you&#x27;re going to use the antibody for.  We are well, well within the ability to synthesize this amount of DNA at an affordable cost, and have been  for a while.

7691971,comment,7689897,7691745,1,0,lispylol,,,"> What I find surprising is that the recruiter still wants me to interview even after I explained who and what I am.<p>Did you tell him that you&#x27;re a psychopath? My point is that if a recruiter reaches out to you, it probably means your online identity matches their criteria for <i>potential candidate</i>. Now this criteria can be as simple as <i>oh neat he uses haskell</i> to <i>I&#x27;m impressed by his contributions to project X, Y, Z</i>. So unless you tell him something that is completely contradictory to his superficial impression of you there&#x27;s no reason he should tell you NOT to interview with the company.<p>Also, I feel like whatever reason the recruiter decided to contact you (Github / nice linkedin profile) has very little to do with the companies hiring bar. It&#x27;s a terrible proxy for measuring how a company hires. It&#x27;s at best an indication of the technologies you&#x27;ll potentially be working with. For example, if you only have java listed chances are you prob. would have never gotten that phone call. You should try it as an experiment.<p>Want to know where the bar actually is? Go for an interview. Of course, what they mean by interview is usually 1-2 rounds of <i>phone</i> interviews. So in essence you&#x27;re still pretty far from being seriously considered as a candidate.",1399143676

One day, a grad student brought me his laptop and asked if I would take a look at it because ""the Internet [was] really slow.""  It turned out that his computer was part of a botnet controlled via IRC, and it was being used to attack hosts on the Intertubes.<p>After sniffing the IP address + port of the IRC server and the channel name and password the botnet was using, I joined the channel with a regular IRC client.  ""/who #channel"" listed <i>thousands</i> of compromised clients, including hundreds with .edu hostnames.  (One university had a dozen hosts from .hr.[university].edu in the channel.  Sleep tight knowing your direct deposit information is in good hands.)<p>There was no way I could notify everyone, so I concentrated on e-mailing abuse@ the .edu domains.  In my e-mails, I explained who I was and where I worked, that one of our computers had been compromised by hackers (yeah yeah terminology), and that in the course of investigating, I found that computers at their university had also been compromised by the same hackers.  I also included a list of the compromised hostnames at their university and the IRC server's information so their networking people could look for other compromised hosts connected to the IRC server if they wanted to.  Relatively basic IT stuff.<p>I didn't get replies from the majority of the universities I sent messages to, including the .hr.[university].edu one.  I got a few thank yous, but I got just as many replies from IT Security Officers and CIOs (including at big name universities) accusing me of hacking their computers and demanding that I stop immediately or face legal action.<p>Those people <i>just didn't understand</i>, and they were in charge of (or ultimately responsible for) their universities' IT security efforts...

If the content that is accessible via JSTOR would be also accessible otherwise, which journal owners would withhold permission from JSTOR to publish their content? That's like saying if the book is available in the library, nobody would ever buy it. Obviously, it is not so.<p>Also, surprisingly, in September 2011 JSTOR made public domain content available to everybody and shortly after that instituted free individual access programs - which they didn't do before, and which by your words should be impossible due to high costs that can not be supported in any other way but by charging for any access.

I kind of got dragged into a derail ranting about the bizarre strawmen above.<p>My core point is that the OP has a theory about there being a school of C programmers that intentionally or unintentionally invoke undefined behavior and expect the compiler to do the right thing.  He's doing a pretty good job of backing it up, although I'm not sure I understand what exactly he's proposing to do about it.<p>... And then he just kind of throws C++ in for the ride, presumably on the argument that C++ is just like C with even more cases for undefined behavior.  But that's not correct because he's making both a <i>technical</i> and a <i>cultural</i> argument. C++ is technologically (mostly) a superset of C, the culture is completely different to the extent that Linus famously argued that the main advantage of using C is that it keeps all the C++ programmers out. <a href=""http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57918"" rel=""nofollow"">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/5791...</a><p>Of the widely fragmented C++ user base, there are multiple, popular methods of development that encourage true high-level development were you are encouraged to target your code to the abstract/portable machine that the standard uses and not your personal guess of how the compiler should work and avoids doing things that require inordinate care to get right.<p>Again, C++ is full of practical problems, the kind of undefined behavior cases the OP worries about don't really rank up there among them.",1358757878

5090558,comment,5088815,5089359,2,0,simonster,,,"> >   2. There are regulatory obstacles for businesses.\n> As someone in the biotech space, this is by far the biggest factor. When you are dealing with humans, crashes and bugs mean deaths. Deaths mean increased regulation, often under the mistaken assumption that more rules would prevent engineers from making bugs. Modern testing and build systems might, but regulators aren't keen to change their testing systems, many of which were encoded by legislation decades ago. For example, adaptive clinical trials have been known to be theoretically superior to the Phase I/II/III design for 15 years, yet are still in limbo[1] at the FDA; their proponents are still banned from trying them out. Facebook does not need a Federal Software Assocation to sign off on its new unit testing framework.<p>There is plenty of basic biomedical research left to be done on animals, and this is far less regulated. In the U.S., rats and mice are effectively exempt from animal welfare laws. NIH imposes some fairly regulations for funding recipients (i.e., universities), but in my experience, it's not very difficult to get a project with legitimate scientific value approved. If you can cure diabetes, it's not unreasonable to ask you to prove it in an animal model first.<p>My understanding is that approved treatments in humans often lag 10 years or so behind what's known to work in animal models, but until we can cure most major illnesses in rats and mice, we can't blame the slow progress in treatments on the difficulty of translating therapies from the lab to the clinic.",1358757301

It strikes me that this can't really be solved at the library level.  There are times when you'll want to retry and there are times when you'll want to drop your work and surface the error to the caller.  Doesn't seem to me like a library can decide which is which.  Which is probably why the I/O syscalls need to surface it in the first place.  (I'd argue if a library like stdio, which does nothing but wrap syscalls and buffer stuff, can decide it, then there's no need for EINTR to exist at all because the syscall could theoretically make the same decisions.)",1358755502

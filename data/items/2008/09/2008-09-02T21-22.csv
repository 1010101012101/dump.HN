As of the later years, JS has become pretty heavy and people use it a lot more.<p>The genius here is to recognize that most of the cool work done to Smalltalk and Self applies equally well to Javascript. It feels like cheating, but the V8 team is actually just picking some low-hanging fruit done with research in the 90's.

I think it would still count as ""not evil.""<p>2. It's much faster at running sites in parallel. It's not ugly. Are you kidding me? This is the most aesthetically pleasing browser I've used. Soft colors, emphasis in all the right areas. And it has native open/close buttons. Windows itself doesn't use consistent design other than those buttons, so it all works.<p>3. Look at the benchmarks. Firefox has had a problem with this. And it's a problem that's been pretty consistent.<p>I must ask, though: why the hell are you griping about this? If you like Firefox more, you can use Firefox. When you respond to a review of something, it ought to be because you've got important points to make. Like my explaining why a lot of your points are bogus. Griping for the sake of gripe is helping nobody, least of all you.<p>4. So you're mad at him for saying that he likes things moving seamlessly? And this did away with the opening dialog box that Firefox and Safari offer on Windows, so it's slightly improved.<p>5. He doesn't rank things. He points out things that he likes. Informally. Almost like, rather than writing an article, he's writing a sort of log of points. A ""web log.""<p>6. Again: a lot of people like incognito. Especially single people aged 16-22, in my experience. I also thought the little magnifying glass guy was cute.<p>7. But not out of the box. And having a light-weight checker is always nice.<p>Also - can't you CHECK things because you write posts like this? Honestly. Do some firsthand reporting.<p>8. No, but Google makes it a lot more transparent. And the blank opening page is pretty awesome. I'd say it even tops Opera's.<p>9. What does Incognito have to do with anything? This is based on Opera's Speed Dial, but it's a bit more complex.<p>10. So, this browser has two buttons - TWO - for opening menus. That's it. And Task Manager happens to be on the first one, underneath Developer, which was the first place I checked, because it made logical sense.<p>""My guess..."" etc.<p>There is no Google Kool-Aid. Most people I know are actually pretty critical of Google. I've been displeased with a lot of their stuff lately. Doesn't change the fact that this browser is sublime and better than anything else currently on the market out-of-the-box. They even topped Safari, and Safari had a damn good out-of-the-box showing, even on Windows. I'd pick this on Windows over Webkit on Mac, actually, which is saying a lot.<p>You can stick to Firefox. This article doesn't talk about how much better Chrome is than Firefox. You're just acting defensive, because something groundbreaking just hit. Fair enough, but please do it in private rather than as a comment. If you've got actual criticisms of this thing, I'd love to hear them.",1220392286

293229,comment,292813,293030,0,0,ibsulon,,,"Do you believe this is endemic to heterosexual relationships? As a gay man, where casual sex is normative (and I am not an exception, though I am by nature monogamous and currently in a monogamous relationship), I don't see any of these problems as you suggest.<p>1. From what I've seen, the player/whore dynamic has minimized in both the heterosexual and LGBT communities. Those who are excessive in community eyes can be shunned (someone who cannot form a relationship, or seems to have no interest in doing so), but regular casual sex is considered normative for all genders.<p>2. Both my partner and I have alternated between periods of promiscuity and monogamy. Even after over 100 partners, my wires have not been permanently separated. I know partners in open relationships who maintain emotional primacy in their relationships and different levels of openness - playing together, open when one is out of town, to full open relationships. In the gay community, at least, I don't see this concern develop.<p>3. Love and devotion are certainly part of the equation! Casual sex is considered, at least in some subcultures, as something to do while in between relationships, or as part of a mutually consenting open relationship.<p>4. This presumes a polygamous male and a monogamous female. In an egalitarian society, we're still talking about a primary partner (or partners, as works quite well with bisexuals, for example.) It does make relationships more confusing as people have to negotiate their own rules, but this doesn't have to be a social regression, unless you're talking about regressing to a common ancestor as the bonobos. :)",1220390579

Then the registration page would look like it was part of your site. Then, when rendering the login page/div, check whether the user is already logged into the provider using some onunfocus AJAX, and then smoothly drop the password field down underneath it if it's needed. (of course, then, <i>you</i> have to handle sending that password to that provider in a secure way, but we're focusing on user-persoective advantages now, so, like with IE6 support, a lot of sweat is to be expected.) from the user's perspective, if they don't know what the little ""OpenID-enabled"" icon next to the username box means, they can just go along with their business, and everything will happen as usual.<p>The only problem at this point is the URL username. To answer that, think about what, for example, gmail does: when you have a gmail.com address, you can drop that part and just use the username part of it.

For the auto-vectorization and use of things like AVX be as advanced in gcc, llvm, and even the Microsoft compiler.",1390251537

The state is a deduction, so you typically have to carry it a few years to see the full benefit. Just in case anyone is curious.<p>To clarify, there _is_ a $7500 federal tax credit, but Nissan just takes it themselves and passes those savings directly to the customer, which is what makes it possible to indirectly use the credit when leasing instead of purchasing.<p>The Georgia $5000 tax credit is indeed a credit, not a deduction, but it&#x27;s a _non-refundable_ credit, meaning if you owe less than $5000 in taxes, you can only take a credit for that lesser amount the first year (so you&#x27;re taxes are $0 instead of negative), but you get up to five years to take the full amount of the credit (in the case of this particular credit).<p>The Georgia credit applies in full even if you lease instead of purchase.

7091673,comment,7090913,7091642,3,0,unavoidable,,,"The PTO is supposed to (and its employees are trained to) disallow trademark claims that do not meet the criteria for obtaining a trademark (for example, due to the term being generic, or because of descriptiveness). So a company that sells candy would not be allowed by the PTO to register a trademark for the word &quot;candy&quot;.<p>Now, the situation gets a bit trickier for words and industries that don&#x27;t really relate, like &quot;candy&quot; and video games (or, as the example in other comments, &quot;apple&quot; and electronics). In this case, the reality is that trademark agents will file a claim for something relatively broad, and the PTO will initially reject the claim for overbreadth (this is the default in practice), whereupon the trademark agent will narrow the claimed goods and services until the PTO accepts it.<p>In some cases, they do not ever accept such claims - but given enough time, one supposes that you can find a narrow enough set of goods that you can market exclusively with the word &quot;candy&quot;.<p>Of course, the PTO is subject to review by courts. The problem for the PTO is that if they reject something, that decision can be appealed. Parties with deep pockets will always try to appeal if they think the mark is worth enough (see Apple). So it&#x27;s a waste of the PTO&#x27;s time and effort to be very aggressive in denying claims.<p>In effect, the process is just one of narrowing and back-and-forth negotiating, rather than a &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; decision.<p>In short, the PTO gets blamed a lot for accepting shitty claims (both patents and trademarks), but they really don&#x27;t have that much incentive to reject claims aggressively, because they get money from applications, and rejections are subject to review anyway.",1390251179

I find their completion to be extremely useful when I can&#x27;t remember exactly what function I want to call, but less useful when I know it and just want to get it typed out.<p>I use Emacs so I don&#x27;t even have the nice semantic completion that IDEs offer (Emacs has some of that with its &quot;cedet&quot;, but I can never figure out how to get it to work properly). But Emacs&#x27;s completion heuristics are good enough for almost everything I do. When you hit the complete key in Emacs (M-/) it first looks backwards through the file you&#x27;re in looking for the word. Then it looks forward. Then it looks in the other files you have open.<p>That looking backwards first thing is the key to why it works so well. And that&#x27;s because most of the time you&#x27;re referencing variable or macros that are nearby in your code, and almost always just up a few lines.

7091659,comment,7089565,7091177,2,0,bad_user,,,"C# was designed for the CLR and the CLR was designed for C#. F# on the other hand has 2 generics systems in the same language, one inherited from C# and one for ML-style Hindley–Milner based on type-erasure and they don&#x27;t interact well.<p>Java&#x27;s generics can&#x27;t be built on top of the CLR&#x27;s reified generics, but this goes for other languages as well - Haskell, ML, Scala, you name it. Basically, reified generics work well in case you design the language in combination with the VM, otherwise it becomes a huge PITA.<p>FYI, the CLR&#x27;s reified generics is one reason for why the JVM is a better target for other languages. For dynamic languages, they are a problem because the bytecode generator has to work around them. For static languages, such as Scala or anything in the ML family, it&#x27;s a problem because either (a) they are designed for co/contra-variance or (b) they don&#x27;t support higher-kinded types or (c) they don&#x27;t support rank-2 types or (d) in case you do need co/contra-variance rules, for some reason Microsoft chose to restrict the declarations only to generic interfaces and delegates, so you can&#x27;t design a List<+T> class for example (to be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if this last one is a limitation of the language or the CLR).<p>Also, having reified generics is less important than you think. Scala for example can do specialization for primitive types and because the type-system is much stronger, coupled with an awesome collections library and pattern matching, the flow of the types is much better. For example, I can&#x27;t remember any instance in which I felt the need to do a (obj isInstanceOf List<int>) check, immutable collections can be covariant without issues and for everything else there are type-classes, something which C# sorely lacks.<p>IMHO, in spite of people&#x27;s opinion on the matter, Java&#x27;s type-erased generics is one of its best features.",1390251001

The second This American Life episode cited by Reuven includes a good indication of why. These cases seem often to be examined not on underlying principle, but on the direct evidence. The &#x27;network update&#x27; patent from TAL was busted not because the patent itself was found to be ambiguous or over-broad but because its authorship was incorrectly assigned to only one of its &#x27;inventors&#x27;. Super narrow and no principle other than &quot;check your application more carefully next time&quot;.<p>In my opinion, this is how it should be. Courts should enforce the law, not change it (excepting the Supreme Court&#x27;s right to reject the unconstitutional). For that, we need to work through Congress to modernize the definition of patents in respect to software.<p>These cases play an important role in that process, which is to create a body of guidance on how software patents are being used and how they are being challenged, for statutory reform and/or legal appeal.<p>[[As is probably obvious, I am not a lawyer, so I apologize for any legal inaccuracies in the above]]",1390250984

Binary logging was not the only reason I ultimately switched. The big reason was that I needed a distribution that did not change so frequently (although I love what Arch is doing). Stability was so important for my use case, though, that I ended up switching to Debian Stable.<p>Although journalctl does work well, I admit, I wonder if the advantages could have been accomplished without the binary file format.

I often optimize numeric and SIMD functions for x64 on Linux, and regularly compare the generated assembly code of current versions of GCC, CLang and Intel compilers.  I have no experience with MSVC.  I&#x27;m often using the C++ compiler, but the code is usually straight C and inline assembly.<p>In my anecdotal opinion, Intel produces faster and better code than GCC and CLang about 2/3 of the time, with GCC usually second, and CLang slowest.  I love the idea of CLang, but so far find it&#x27;s main advantage to be clearer error messages rather than fast code.<p>Bugwise, I think they all are about equal.  Intel&#x27;s weakness right now (for my work) is that it crumbles under very high vector register pressure.  And as a free academic licensee, support seems limited to posting on a forum and hoping a relevant Intel employee wanders by.<p>If I had just one shot for a compile and was hoping for the best outcome without being able to test and verify, I&#x27;d compile with Intel.  But considering that GCC comes with source, has a much larger community, and accessible bug trackers, it&#x27;s probably a better day-to-day compiler.

However, there&#x27;s a different issue - it&#x27;s the inherent risk and unpredictability of a startup. And opportunity cost.<p>Basically, there&#x27;s a non-trivial likelihood that the startup revenues could diminish or disappear. There are many reasons for this - churn rate, unsustainable customer acquisition costs, market changes, a new competitor emerging offering a free product, who knows. As a result, if you are counting on the startup as your sole source of income, you need to &quot;pad&quot; this with the expected downside risk.<p>If there&#x27;s a 50% chance of income going to zero in two years, then you need to double your $5k to be able to have the &quot;excess&quot; income now to be able to weather the potential zero-income later. In this way, over 2 years, you will still have $5k a month, even if revenue goes to 0 in year 2. Make sense?<p>The larger the likelihood of failure, the greater this risk-multiplier.<p>Also, there&#x27;s the Opportunity Cost trade off. If you can work for someone else with minimal risk and get the same $5k versus work your butt off carrying all the same risk for the same $5k, which would you choose? The &quot;safer&quot; $5k will always win. In such case, comparing $5k in startup revenues to $5k in salary is not a direct comparison. If you are working twice as hard for the same $5k with twice as much risk, you should be earning twice as much. Otherwise, just do the &quot;easier&quot; job. This is not as much a financial calculation as a Real Opportunity Cost calculation.<p>This is why I often say - if you want to replace your salaried job with startup revenue as a sole source of income, take your monthly salary, multiply it by three, and this is what your monthly SaaS revenue should be to weather future potential downside and account for greater risk for the same reward.",1390249221

Like Gulp, Fez&#x27;s subtasks run in parallel. It looks like Fez launches them in subprocesses in order to prevent conflicts, which is a good idea. I&#x27;m skeptical of parallelism in builds, though, because race conditions lead to nasty, hard-to-detect-and-fix bugs. I don&#x27;t think the theoretical speed boost is worth the potential of defects getting into released code.<p>2- Automatic pipelining. Also like Gulp, Fez can pipe the output of one operation to the input of another. This is useful because you can avoid dealing with temporary files. Unlike Gulp, Fez has an extremely simple and non-error-prone way of constructing those pipelines. I like it.<p>The major advantage of Fez (and Jake) over Grunt and Gulp is that they use file timestamps to tell if a task needs to run. This can lead to major speed benefits. I recently modified my Jakefile to use this sort of dirty checking on my Sass compiler. I don&#x27;t change my CSS that often, but the css task was doing an expensive &quot;shell to Ruby&quot; command on every build no matter what. Adding dirty checking shaved my typical build time down from 6.5s to 3.5s.<p>Overall, Fez looks like a really nice tool. It has a strong ideology (rule-based transformation of files) tempered by a nice dose of practicality. For example, although Fez wants every task to define a file-transformation rule, it also supports &quot;imperative mode&quot; for tasks that don&#x27;t fit that model. It&#x27;s very promising, and I&#x27;m looking forward to learning more.<p>[1] Jake: <a href=""https://github.com/mde/jake"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mde/jake</a>",1390248899

Lightweight threads have been extremely successful in Haskell, Erlang, etc, and not just on microbenchmarks.<p>They&#x27;re mostly successful in languages that GC/heap-allocate all stack frames (paying the costs that come with it). Rust uses the machine stack so the benefits come with some very significant drawbacks, most notably unpredictability of performance that comes from stack thrashing. Large mallocs are slower than small mallocs in general, but on the typical sizes you need for machine stack segments you probably aren&#x27;t going to hit the malloc implementation&#x27;s free list anyway, so you might as well just allocate up front.

Environmentalists, once ridiculed as “tree-huggers” are now often characterized as “environmental terrorists” — as individuals we should fear and neutralize. The hacktivist Jeremy Hammond, who exposed the nefarious dealings of the private intelligence corporation Stratfor and its clients, was characterized as someone seeking to cause “mayhem” by Federal District Judge Loretta Preska when she sentenced him to 10 years in prison.</i><p>Horse. Shit. Jeremy Hammond decided that he didn&#x27;t like what a private organization and its supporters were saying. So, he coordinate a large-scale breakin of their computers, stole the credit card numbers of all its subscribers, and released them on the Internet. This is par for the course for Hammond, who a few years earlier stormed a restaurant in Skokie that had been hosting a holocaust denier; the resulting mayhem injured only innocent bystanders, one of whom was hit with a broken bottle wielded by one of the &quot;protesters&quot;. Ludlow is quick to spend column inches painting a picture of an unjustly extreme sentence for Hammond, but not at all interested in informing readers of Hammond&#x27;s history, which included a previous felony conviction for the same crime.<p>If Ludlow is the only person whose writing on Hammond you read, you could be excused for believing that Hammond is of a kind with Aaron Swartz. Which is, of course, his intent; he&#x27;s made the comparison explicit elsewhere.<p>This is how Ludlow seems to argue, in piece after piece. He evokes political messages that many reasonable people, myself often included, would have a hard time arguing with. &quot;Global War On Terror&quot;? Fuck yes, that&#x27;s a problem. It&#x27;s so obviously a problem that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with then-SecDef Robert Gates, lobbied (unsuccessfully) to stop pretending that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing. It is an utterly banal observation. Orwellian surveillance of US citizens? How could opposition to that possibly be unreasonable?<p>But then he uses that accord to immunize actions reasonable people can&#x27;t support. Using violence to make political statements isn&#x27;t persuasion; it&#x27;s thuggery. It&#x27;s how you justify blowing up women&#x27;s health clinics. Ludlow diminishes everyone who dissents from the conduct of the government by continuously supporting thuggery.",1390248041

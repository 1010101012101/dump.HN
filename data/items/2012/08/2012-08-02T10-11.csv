I know the very first film formats were actually square for both moving & static images. Why did video quickly settle on 4:3 / 16:9 while photo explored the portrait, landscape & square formats? Is it really just because of the technical constraints (the device to 'play' the media) or is there a more fundamental, natural reason?",1343905024

4328134,comment,4327908,4328026,7,0,nitrogen,,,"An increased ""clarity"" or ""spaciousness"" of sound can be caused by anything from a slight increase in total gain (even as small as 0.5dB) to bypassing or enabling bass and treble controls, even if the controls are set to zero.  Some sound chips also have ""3D"" effects which mix inverted and/or delayed copies of the left and right channels with each other, that can increase or decrease perceived spaciousness.  Differences in power management approaches between the operating systems can increase or decrease electrical noise in the system (more noise means finer details are masked), and could also affect the accuracy of the sample rate clock, resulting in different amounts or types of sample jitter between OSes.  There are other DAC parameters (i.e. DC bias -- some chips might be able to produce a balanced signal between -Vs and +Vs, but only if they have a negative supply; otherwise they have to fall back to 0V to Vs) that Linux may be programming differently.<p>The best way to identify any differences is to run the audio into a calibrated measurement device (at the very top end an Audio Precision box) and check the gain, frequency response, jitter, THD+N, etc.",1343904718

This is so incredibly important. Anyone on your team should be able to run the test suite from the command line by invoking a single command. The easier and the quicker a test suite runs, the more people will run it.<p>Also, spending a day to setup a CI server (Jenkins, circleci.com or similar) is a good use of your time. You want to have the CI run the test suite after every commit to your mainline branches in SCM.<p>Another key aspect to testing is generating clear and concise error output. One thing I find very frustrating is when a CI build fails, but it is not clear why. I find most CI systems are very good at listing all the passing tests, or when a few tests fail in the expected way. When tests fail hard (exceptions thrown, processing not start or not running) I find that I often need to go reading through build logs to find out what went wrong and why.",1343904106

But there's still some software overhead to overcome. They might also be using a proprietary D3D-on-OpenGL layer, like the ones being used for some Mac ports of Windows games (edit: seems like they are not).<p>I hope that Steam, and gamers that use Mac and Linux in general, will push for bigger changes in OpenGL, both specs and implementations.<p>disclaimer: I write GPU drivers for living",1343902404

Second, Germans intuitively don't feel much of a need to help local organizations or schools: ""that's the government's job, that's what I pay taxes for.""</i><p>I think the main driver for these different approaches is that the German state basically says ""in the end we'll help you"" while the US says ""in the end you're on your own"".<p>The German approach in my opinion does more to alleviate outcast-scale poverty. However, the quality of helping loses because:<p>a) those who would help mostly help people from other continents since they think that their countrymen are well off anyway<p>b) those who do help, are put there to help in form of public officers<p>But even with a strong social-net as in Germany there are still poor people. What happens when a)-people don't care and b)-people just follow orders is that our poors usually never get on their own feet and out of their dependency because their is no one telling them how to help themselves. That's what I mean with quality of helping.<p>And yes, this article seems very outdated, but to me the subject would still make a promising headline. One thing I observed is that both countries got less different over the years: If you look at the policies regarding the social-net, Europe has tried to become more american (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartz_concept"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartz_concept</a>) while the US has tried to become more european (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Health_Care_for_America_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Health_Care_for_Amer...</a>).",1343901694

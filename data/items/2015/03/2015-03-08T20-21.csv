I completed my MFA in 2012 with a thesis I&#x27;d call computational poetry or computational literature. Goldsmith as you mention is trying to float uncreative writing--which I think is a decent-enough broad term that covers a lot of territory, but I suspect it, too, won&#x27;t find much purchase outside of literary circles.<p>I&#x27;m happy to get this chance to discover a number of your projects, particularly the PoetryDB. You may already know this, but I also wanted to point out that the field of computational literary criticism and analysis are also building steam, and you may want to think of your DB/API in terms of both a creative service for computational poets, and a service to computational literary critics.<p>You may want to see work by Franco Moretti for a starting point here if you aren&#x27;t familiar (particularly &quot;Graphs Maps Trees&quot;, and &quot;Distant Reading&quot;). There&#x27;s a nice review for starters in Wired from a few years ago.

Here&#x27;s my two cents and I&#x27;m sorry if it&#x27;s not what you want to hear:<p>The foundation of recruiting is sales - you are competing again internal, external recruiters and many other avenues pursued by an employer to hire THE best candidate for a given role.  They don&#x27;t care about anything but you delivering the best in the most efficient way possible.<p>I regular give advice to people testing new tech recruiting approaches - because the system is broken in many ways.  The worst attempts at fixing are generally made by engineers with limited understanding of what it takes to actually be.a.recruiter.  They assume that their technical proficiency will give them the edge - wrong.  This is the mistake made by most technical people who believe they&#x27;ll also succeed in sales - it ends up being a handicap.  For the most part, actuaries make terrible insurances salespeople, mechanics fail in car sales, and so on.  Human first, salesperson second, technician  a distant third.<p>At this point, all you have is a visually appealing tool that may add a tiny fraction to the employer&#x27;s hiring productivity.  But that means nothing unless you have the best candidates for them, yesterday.  If you are starting from scratch, you&#x27;ll either need to partner with a recruiter with a huge rolodex or spend about years building up your own.  You cannot just enter this game without a huge database ready for your hiring campaign.  It&#x27;s a numbers game, it takes massive outreach before you can even offer a simple tool like this to differentiate yourself.  Until then, an employer could care less unless you&#x27;ve proven you can deliver the best candidate, now.<p>Hope this helps!",1425848265

9167212,comment,9166501,9166501,0,0,joesmo,,,"&quot;If people are wired for engineering logic and have programmed in some capacity in the past, they almost certainly can get up to speed in any other part of the field. Let them learn, or even better, help them learn.&quot;<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more with this and the article in general. So many people who have the capacity and potential to continue to be good engineers are overlooked because they don&#x27;t know a specific framework or language or because they worked with unpopular tools in the past. It seems to be a trend to do absolutely zero training these days and expect the engineer to not only learn on his own, but to teach himself outside of the job. Some companies even expect extensive open source work from candidates while at the same time requiring incredibly long hours. The idea that candidates might be doing other, non-programming things outside of work, want time to do those, and might not be interested in pursuing their craft 24/7 is looked down upon. I can&#x27;t think of a single profession that&#x27;s so demanding.<p>The irony is that most jobs in the field are incredibly easy for someone who is even moderately skilled and hardly ever use the skills being tested for. When these things are eventually needed, all that one needs to do is a bit of research to come up with a good solution, but somehow this is looked down upon. Most programming jobs and professions that do not require knowing how to build algorithms, jobs in which if you&#x27;re writing search algorithms or any other kind you&#x27;re simply doing it wrong and wasting time. Why would we expect all programmers to know how to write certain algorithms or solve certain unfamiliar problems off the top of their head when that isn&#x27;t what they&#x27;ve focused on in years, if ever? You wouldn&#x27;t expect a cardiologist to be an expert in neurology, yet many software companies are really only seeking the equivalent of neurology experts when they actually need a variety of expertise. Sure, a general background is good, and most good developers will have a broad understanding of many topics, but expecting a deep understanding of every topic is simply ridiculous.  The companies with such expectations end up hiring the same type of expert while ignoring a ton of talent.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that in the end, this is a job. Despite all the rhetoric about loving the work and other such nonsense, 99% of programming positions are just another job that no one would do if they didn&#x27;t pay well. It&#x27;s not in the workers&#x27; best interests to be emotionally invested in their work as this only benefits the employer to the detriment of the employee. Thus, most things will still be learned on the job, either with the support of or more commonly, in spite of the employer. People work the job because they want to provide for themselves and their family. If the job is enjoyable, it&#x27;s mutually beneficial, but that&#x27;s not something that can generally be expected. Yet many employers expect employees to both love their job and love the profession enough to put in a ton of additional time outside of work learning and coding for free because they are too cheap to provide proper training and their working conditions are generally to abysmal for them to retain workers long-term.<p>The solution here is to hire people with a good general background and invest in their education on the job. To do so, employers need to find people who can actually see the potential in others and who know how to interview, not people whose idea of a good interview is asking whiteboard questions and insisting the candidates talk them through the problem instead of letting them think it through and actually solve it. This requires employers to actually respect employees once they are hired so they can be retained long-term and their training is worth the investment. This would be an even bigger change than changing the interview process. Employers would have to stop asking employees to work for free (salaried overtime). They would have to stop being childish themselves and literally yell at or threaten employees. Employers would have to afford their employees basic human respect, something that is severely lacking in technology companies, especially in Silicon Valley. Those changes would indeed be radical, and employers who implement them quickly find out what the rest of us have known for years: there is no shortage of talent or good engineers.",1425848052

Even when your standards are higher, it&#x27;s still easy to hire people that are just slightly more incompetent, just by not doing a coding assignment.<p>This is why, at least around here in the Midwest, it&#x27;s easy to stereotype other programmers by just looking at the last few companies they worked for. Came from XYZ? I won&#x27;t even suggest an interview, because their architects would barely be junior devs here. Came from ABC? You don&#x27;t need a screening, because you&#x27;d not have lasted two years there if you aren&#x27;t at least decent.<p>This is the real reason hiring through networking is so prevalent around here. If someone competent vouches for you enough to bring your resume forward, chances are they&#x27;ll at least not embarrass themselves in a simple interview that asks for a little bit of coding.<p>The reluctance of accepting a mistake in hiring is also an issue too, but I see more of that when we add both time and changing standards. For instance, I know of a big company that started with a really low talent level. They somehow managed to hire better people than they had, as time went by, but promotions have a lot to do with seniority. So you have a team of &#x27;architects&#x27;, that are supposedly in charge of things, but that, really, are worse at their job than the people that they are currently hiring. So what happens there? They have this nice cycle of hiring developers, having the good ones see that they will have to spend their time there arguing with architects that were never that talented, and whose skills are now outdated. But the architects have been there so long, they are part of the scenery. They&#x27;ll never quit, as they&#x27;d never pass another interview for their experience level somewhere else, but they&#x27;ll never leave their spot open unless they are fired. And management will not fire them, because they are old buddies. That&#x27;s how organizations decline.",1425847972

9167167,comment,9165917,9166982,0,0,davmre,,,"The marginal benefit of grad school is obviously a very personal thing. It depends on a) how excited you are about your current position/opportunities in industry, and b) how excited you are about the independent research you&#x27;d pursue in a PhD program. The latter will of course depend on what program(s) you&#x27;re considering, who your likely advisors might be, and if there&#x27;s a research topic you&#x27;re passionate about investigating that you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to pursue in industry.<p>In my case, I was interested in machine learning, and after doing some internships as an undergrad concluded that there was no easy path to work on interesting ML problems in industry with only a bachelor&#x27;s degree (both because the positions weren&#x27;t available, and because I didn&#x27;t know enough to do the work). So for me the first-order benefit is that I get to spend my time learning about and working on stuff that I&#x27;m interested in, and developing a skill set and a credential that should let me keep working on interesting things for the foreseeable future. It&#x27;s different for other people, of course: some want to become professors, some want knowledge for knowledge&#x27;s sake, some could pursue their chosen area equally well in industry but have a <i>specific</i> crazy idea they want the freedom to explore (I think this is more common in systems research), some want the lifestyle flexibility to go skiing in the middle of the week and make up by cramming work on weekends, etc. For most people it&#x27;s really a mix of these factors and others.<p>The other main bit of grad school advice I have is that your relationship with your advisor is extremely important. The chance to be mentored one-on-one for six years by an extremely bright person you click with, share interests with, and who wants you to succeed is <i>incredibly</i> valuable. On the flip side, the possibility of being stuck for six years under a boss who doesn&#x27;t care about you or know how to motivate you and develop your skills can be a massive liability (and one that&#x27;s harder to escape than the equivalent situation in industry, since a lot of people internalize the value structure of academia and think of quitting a PhD as a failure on the part of the student rather than the advisor). So whatever you can find out about your likely advisors -- both by talking directly to them when you visit (are they looking for new students? do they seem enthusiastic about you specifically? how do they help their students find research topics? what is their philosophy of how to develop a student&#x27;s skills as an independent researcher?), and by talking to their students: take them out to coffee and ask pointed questions like &quot;is X a good advisor?&quot;, &quot;what do you like/dislike about working with X?&quot;, &quot;what sort of person is best suited to working with X?&quot;, &quot;would you make the same choice again?&quot; -- should have a huge bearing on your decision whether to attend, even if your program doesn&#x27;t actually make you choose an advisor initially.",1425847507

As such, from the university&#x27;s perspective (which you took in your comment), one cannot say that they are being compensated, at all.<p>Assuming that you do understand that a graduate assistant (in this case, e.g. a research assistant who is also a student) is actually an employee of the university,<p>- The training they receive (courses et al) is what we call unpaid training. They do not receive salary for the hours they spend receiving training, which is a requirement for them to do their job (research assistant) efficiently and successfully.<p>- Would you accept payment in prestige if you were in, say, Google or Apple? A graduate school has much less prestige (hence the need for &quot;internships&quot;).<p>- Independence does not exist for a grad assistant, whose not only livelihood but also school registration depends on her/his relationship with her/his &quot;mentor&quot; (i.e. boss / advisor to boss) and other department members. Not only job security but also school security depends on maintaining &quot;good relationships&quot; with these people.

Other techniques may only be able to work up to 320x200 or something.<p>Similarly, telling whether a computer has written something or not is very challenging at this snippet size because there&#x27;s hardly any room for &quot;voice&quot; to shine through. I actually did pretty well, but to be honest I got more mileage out of a meta-heuristic (&quot;how is the author trying to fool me? ah, this one seems really, <i>really</i> human so it must be computer... yup...&quot;) than actual analysis of the text. I mean, drop those computer-generated sports sentences into the middle of a human sports column and you&#x27;re not going to pick them out specially... they&#x27;re facts. They fit. However, an entire column written like can be pretty obvious. I get some financial news from some Google Alerts on a couple of companies and it&#x27;s incredibly obvious that there are computer algorithms out there that can take the daily outcome for a stock, how the market did that day, and how the entire industry did that day, and spin that into several hundred words of completely and utterly <i>useless</i> speculation about &quot;why&quot; the stock did a certain thing.

It can also work if the person being hired is having a hard time finding a job.<p>>Also, ideally you have a specific small project for them to work on.<p>Actually giving them a project, you know, meeting the legal definition for &quot;contractors&quot;  is super rare, at least on the middle where I work.   I do see it happen, but it&#x27;s usually those &quot;10x&quot; programmers who get those jobs.    Or it&#x27;s jobs working for poor companies that pay very little.<p>In the middle, you find people like me, usually working through corporations (or in my case, whole chains of corporations) that end up paying the contractor on a W2... the idea being that the irs is less likely to reclassify the kid if someone is paying payroll taxes somewhere -  because the work does not make the legal definition of contractor.<p>As an aside, I think most of this shell game isn&#x27;t about legal liability; it&#x27;s about making it clear to the other employees who is a temp and who isn&#x27;t.   From a legal perspective, compared to what you pay a body shop, firing someone just isn&#x27;t that expensive.    My belief is that the major cost in firing someone that is performing okay is in morale of your remaining employees.   firing your contractors first allows you to have the flexibility to fire someone without making your full time folk feel like they might be next.<p>>Finally, you have to be able to pay them the market rate. If all of that fits (rare) then it&#x27;s a great choice.<p>See, it&#x27;s not rare, and it happens at all pay grades.  Different pay grades have different rituals and ways of arranging things, though.  Right now I&#x27;m working as a &quot;contractor&quot;  -  I&#x27;m going through some shady body shop, but I actually sit at a desk in the office and eat the free food with the employees.  They pay okay, and the expectation they set was that I&#x27;ll be a contractor for a year, I mean, assuming things work out, and then if we like oneanother, they&#x27;ll hire me full time at the end of the year.<p>That kind of arrangement is really common in this industry when the economy is good.  They need people now, and I can be a person now, and if they like me, well, that&#x27;s an easy hire.   If they don&#x27;t like me, or if market conditions change before the year is out, they can let me go without damaging employee morale as much as firing a full-timer.    (similar arrangements, with less emphasis on you becoming a full-timer at the end are common when the economy is bad.)<p>I like it &#x27;cause I&#x27;m going through a company that I mostly own, and it gets a bunch of money corp to corp which I can use to pay my people to see if my business can get off the ground, (it pays me, too, on a W2, and buys me mediocre health insurance) and if at the end of the year, it does take off, well, I quit, and hey I was a contractor, right? that was the deal.   and if my business doesn&#x27;t take off, I&#x27;ve got a foot in the door at a decent big company where I might want to actually work for a few years, you know, put something on my resume besides abject failure.<p>But, as far as I can tell, this arrangement is super common.

The chips that had failed in manufacturing testing were just tested again to determine whether the faulty part in the chip was in upper or lower half of the 64kbit address range. The high address bit of memory chip was connected permanently high or low to keep the address pointing to a working half of chips, thus enabling the extremely cheap broken 64kbit chips to be used as valid 32kbit chips.<p>(All eight chips of memory of course had to have be broken in the same upper/lower configuration).<p>The Psion chess program for Spectrum needed the 48K RAM model, although I think someone also wrote a full chess program for the 16K model (including castling, en passant and all).<p>Psion, by the way, was publisher for much of the early software for ZX Spectrum, including chess, spreadsheet and 3D design programs.

Rant from the aircraft industry follows, feel free to ignore.<p>Engineering incompetence is widespread from my experience (flight test engineering). I wish, as a flight test instrumentation engineer, that I had not had engineers from various disciplines ask me how to interpret the contents of their test monitoring screens. I am responsible for providing the accelerometers, strain gages, data bus monitoring, and so forth that the various teams request and making sure that the data from those sensors is decision quality and properly telemetered and recorded. But it is NOT my responsibility to interpret that data. And yet, some of these other engineers, who are responsible for real-time monitoring of safety of test parameters during flights, clearly have no clue what they are looking at. One engineer even confused hydraulic pressures with engine temperatures during one test I was involved with and was about to raise a fault against my system because she thought the data was faulty. That&#x27;s just one instance -- sadly, I have encountered many more during this career.<p>Yes, these people are trained in their disciplines and on the content of their monitoring screens, but for some, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to stick.

The deeper you dive the more apparent it should be what kind of role they played in the whole thing and what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p>Me? I suck at whiteboard coding exercises.

- (command) splits the output on newlines.
- Block syntax is simpler, with exception of boolean composite conditions that need awkward begin ..; end wrapping
- &quot;everything is a command&quot; syntax makes writing sometimes more verbose but reading easier.
- prototyping at the command line then turning into a script is easier thanks to multi-line editing with indentation and syntax highlight.<p>There is however the portability factor.  I&#x27;ve used fish as my only interactive shell for at least 5 years yet I rarely write a script complex enough to justify requiring users to have fish installed.

Unreal 4 is great in 2015, id Tech 3 with little development since 1999 feels like yesterday.<p>Unreal, ID Tech, CryEngine, etc. most modern game engines date back to the mid to late nineties. But where as e.g. the Unreal 4 engine has been in continuous development since 1995 and came originally with an editor coded in Visual Basic, one cannot compare the limited Unreal 1 of 1998 with Unreal 4 as of today. Sure many code lines are still unchanged and in Unreal 4 but especially the graphics and editor have changed a lot.<p>A modern Call of Duty (e.g. Ghosts) still use a heavily modified Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.² engine (Ritual&#x27;s ÜberTools) which itself was a heavily modified id Tech 3 engine with the GtkRadiant editor. Infinity Ward added texture and map streaming in Modern Warfare 2. The id Tech 3 engine is now open source, but there is a big difference in the capabilities of what you can do with Infinity Ward Call of Duty engine and what you can do with id Tech 3 that has seen little development since then - also in the tool section.<p>GoldSource/Source/Source2(?) is one of the oldest engine still used in AAA games, based on Quake and Quake World. The Worldcraft/Hammer editor is dated in comparison to UnrealEd. Hammer editor for Source 2 engine seems to catch up.",1425845560

But it would be unwise to ignore the history of distance learning, which started with correspondence colleges in the 1800s. Certainly anything which was done by post can be done now by computer, so I have no doubt that MOOCs can work. The question is how judge if they are &quot;radically superior&quot;.<p>California used to have (1). The GI bill also meant (1) for many veterans. Germany, Sweden, and some other countries still have (1). Which makes it easy to judge if current US universities are radically inferior to tuition-free universities. The Open University in the UK is a decades old example of (2) and (3), though not (1).<p>It&#x27;s therefore hard for me to accept that MOOCs are significantly more radical and superior than existing systems which already incorporate most of the points that are supposed to make it radical and superior.<p>And, (4) Seriously? What, some employer is going to come and insist seeing my individual assignments for partial differential equations before hiring me? And read through my essays for sociology class? And my term papers for introductory philosophy? Embrace the Panopticon!<p>For that matter, my wife&#x27;s college (she takes online courses) is focused on team projects, so most of her assignments are done with 2-3 other people. How is the outside world supposed to figure out which part is hers? How much time are they willing to spend to disentangle this?<p>And finally, if this were useful then a pen-and-paper correspondence college could add a small surcharge per course to hire someone to scan incoming mail and put it in a file for future reference. That that hasn&#x27;t happened, nor that there&#x27;s been a call for it, suggests that it isn&#x27;t so useful.",1425845472

And, what if there&#x27;d surface a JS crypto library that&#x27;s also pretty time-tested and be considered equally secure as, say, OpenSSL?<p>The almost competent developers could be relying on entirely standard OSS browser-side encryption library. If they then make a minor fuckup on the backend (say, forget to update OpenSSL in heartbleed-times, <i>or</i> look past that newest Rails vuln Egor Homakov found, <i>or</i> look over an intern-created SQL injection in a code review, etc), then the harm is smaller because there&#x27;s simply no plaintext <i>ever</i> in memory on the server.<p>Like the GP said, by doing client-side security, you really <i>do</i> add another layer, right? This of course assumes that the client-side JS is decent, but there&#x27;s no need for the coders of the app to homebrew that just like they don&#x27;t tend to homebrew their HTTP server or their SSL layer.<p>Sure, some of the above-mentioned vulnerabilities could enable a hacker to also inject false encryption JS code but that&#x27;s still way more complex than just injecting some server-side code that dumps plaintext to pastebin.<p>I&#x27;m interested because I consider myself to be such an &quot;almost competent&quot; developer, at least when it comes to security.

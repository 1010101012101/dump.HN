But those programming tasks will be accomplished and made tractable and tolerable through the use of macros that someone else wrote.<p>Think of the analog of writing a desktop application: there are many object-oriented desktop app frameworks where you can write pretty rich apps exclusively by instantiating existing classes, and this is possible because some domain experts designed a framework for writing desktop apps.<p>Macroswhich I've been using as a shorthand for ""syntactic innovation""are the same way.

As a student that was well versed, I can say with absolute certainty that I found it very frustrating to be paying thousands to learn the difference between = and ==, and the function of if statements.  If you are well versed, at least the first two years of computer science curriculum are painfully easy, and the only interesting thing to do is see how quickly you can complete assignments.<p>Perhaps Computer Science should be treated differently because of this issue.  If every student took a 1-credit skills evaluation and placement course, they could be assessed and properly placed so the students that already have some knowledge can move ahead and start learning right away, while the remaining students can take the introductory courses at an appropriate pace.",1304340969

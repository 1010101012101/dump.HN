2126891,comment,2126093,2126832,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"eBay is certainly an aging service. It has had very few significant feature changes since perhaps 1998 or so. However, it does have a fair amount of competition (amazon and craigslist being the best examples). Most of the competition for eBay comes in the form of catering better to particular segments of the market. Craigslist caters more to the yard-sale segment (timeliness, locality, and just-getting-rid-of items being more important than maximizing revenue or selling/buying niche items). Amazon caters to small, niche sellers (people selling lots of used books, or trans-shipping medical supplies, etc.) More competitors will come along targeting more and more segments of eBay's current market.<p>Paypal is a different story. It's a very much harder business on the fundamentals. One of the world's largest financial institutions which has grown up in the blink of an eye and faces problems on a scale that no other bank in the world faces. Criticism of paypal is often fair, but sometimes it's ungrounded from perspective (of the ""garsh, why don't these piece of junk hover-shoes work right?"" variety). The real criticism should be toward our archaic banking systems and regulation. The services that paypal offers should ideally be built into any old bank account, but they aren't because the system is so heavily regulated and still married to outmoded ideas.",1295600070

I couldn't get Plan 9 to boot on real hardware or in qemu until a couple of years ago, but once I got up and running, the documentation was a little less than satisfactory (there are man pages and research papers, but not many ""getting started with X"" or ""how to do Y""; maybe I've been spoiled by Linux, where howto's have been prolific for 15 years).<p>acme is really cool, even moreso now that there is Linux kernel support for 9P2000, so you can mount acme's filesystem and write programs in any language that does I/O to do arbitrary things to windows and text.  rc is also the nicest shell I've ever used.<p>Plan 9 has always been a research OS (although I wonder if, had it been opened up at the right time instead of staying at Bell Labs, we might all be using it now).  But the ideas in it are gradually making their way to the rest of us, which is what I'm really excited about.  Things like the aforementioned 9P2000 support in Linux, libixp, wmii's use of 9P for scripting, and even Inferno are pretty nice.  (Can you imagine if all of those horrid, monolithic GTK/Qt /Cocoa apps were as scriptable as acme is?  Even the ones that give you a scriping language pale in comparison.)<p>Although I don't really use Plan 9, having the ports around has been great for showing to people what I get so excited about (although that's just a fraction), and the 9fans mailing list is possibly the best one I'm subscribed to.  You hear more on that list about interesting software architecture and UI design than I thought possible.  It's a great place to lurk.",1295599672

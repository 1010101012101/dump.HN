30575,comment,30490,30564,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm not certain your definition of ""art fag"" and her definition match.  I don't think she includes the Engels-reading baristas in that category - that's why she listed them explicitly as ""not working class"".  Rather, I think she's referring to artists who basically give themselves up for art, delving into really esoteric tastes and edgy artwork.<p>To use a couple pop-culture examples that you may or may not be familiar with: none of the characters in Rent are art fags.  Isaac Mendez from Heroes may be, but we don't know much of his history before he became a junkie or what he does besides paint the future.  The characters from Scott Westerfield's novel ""The End Days"" are, as are the somewhat-caricatured characters in Terry Pratchett's ""Soul Music"".",1182797015

30573,comment,30490,30506,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Looking at it some more, I am still convinced that there is some truth to it, but there really is also a lot of very, uh, fluid logic going on.""<p>It's sociology, what do you expect?  ;-)  (I nearly majored in sociology in college, taking 4 courses before I switched first back to physics and then to computer science.  This gave me both a basic fluency in the lingo and a healthy disrespect for its conclusions or lack thereof.)<p>Anyway, you have to understand the particular school of thought she's coming from.  This article's steeped in the lingo of Gramsci and Spivak, who studied primarily power relations within society, particularly the question of ""Who decides who can speak?""  In sociology, there's the concept of a discourse, which is basically ""What can you talk about without getting odd looks?""  Certain discourses are legitimated: you can talk about Heroes or Desperate Housewives or Paris Hilton or the Red Sox and everyone will find it socially acceptable.  Certain discourses are relegated to specialized niches, but still socially acceptable: you can talk about monads or CSS or DNA replication and people won't think you weird, but they may not listen either.  And certain discourses are fringe: if you talk about how 9/11 was an inside job or put on eyeshadow and leather pants for a goth party, people will think you a little nutty, unless you're on Reddit.<p>In this context, the article's list makes a little more sense.  What's considered socially acceptable discussion in high school?  Pop music, the latest movies, that party at the class bitch's house, homecoming, cheerleading and school spirit, and apparently Facebook.  What's not?  Having to work to support your family and put yourself through school.  Slacking off and doing lots of drugs.  Weird art bands that nobody has heard of.  Local music that nobody has heard of.  Wearing odd clothing or odd makeup.  Being gay, unless you live on the northern portion of either coast.  And apparently MySpace.<p>Basically - ask yourself ""Who would you want your daughter to date?""  Unless you're one of those enlightened parents that believes in letting their kids make their own choices, you probably wouldn't want her going out with an art fag.  You wouldn't want her dating a stoner or a gansta.  You'd look at her a little weird if she brought home a goth or a punk.<p>This is different from the notion of social class that William Julius Wilson or Barbara Ehrenreich writes about.  That's much more (though not wholly) economic and educational, and is closer to popular definitions of social class.  The Gramscian notions of hegemon/subaltern are much more about power and people's unconscious reactions to cultural behavior.",1182796227
30572,comment,30445,30541,0,0,enriketuned,,,"Yes I totally agree with you. If they manage to take 50 percent, all of the informational queries from Google. Then they've kinda yeah done it. I just think that just achieving this will be super difficult. To get people to move their bottoms away from Google, PS will have to blow them away. And even if they manage to get 50 percent, it does not equal 50 percent revenue. So much less money to be made with ""Who won the academy award in 2001""-style queries than with a dull ""mortgage refinance"" query.",1182796146

30567,comment,30456,30542,0,0,enriketuned,,,"No need to apologize. I think your question was clear enough. Probably my lack of sleep plus me being not a native speaker. No rudeness intended from my side either. I'm not in a YComb startup, but was part of one (non YC :-))  that went down 2 years ago. So it's probably  off-topic here but I think it might be useful so I just post (also writing about might help me get over it ;-)). Our project was a rather complicated Java thing. We started off with XP and everything was sort of fine. Running short of time we decided that we had to code at twice the speed(!). No more XP, no more Java doc(!), 6 months all went fine, then 2 new people in the team, and two old people out. Actually it was 2 old out (rather unexpected) and 2 new in, which made it worse. A total mess. A generic advice: Always keep an eye on the codebase and try to spread the knowledge of it. It's not only that the wrong person might quit for whatever reason, people get sick, stranded while travelling, crazy etc ... . Best luck with your venture",1182795028

30564,comment,30490,30553,0,0,weel,,,"I understand your point, but mine was that she fluidly goes back and forth between various definitions. I do think that she realizes this, and it is probably inevitable, but it makes it hard for me to wrap my head around exactly what she is trying to say. Danah writes: ""I will attempt to delineate what we see on social network sites in stereotypical, descriptive terms meant to evoke an image."" I think I understand why she wants to take that approach (it's easier), but the problem with it is that it makes it very hard for her readers to disengage from their own stereotypes and prejudices and evaluate her ideas on the merits. Basically, it works just as long as she's preaching to the choir.<p>As for the working class art fags (I dislike the term, by the way, but that's another can o' worms altogether): I'm not saying art is the way to riches, but rather just applying the cultural, rather than income-based, idea of class that is, it would seem to me, implicit in the words ""all of my anti-capitalist college friends who work in cafes and read Engels are not working class just because they make $14K a year and have no benefits.""

30563,comment,30490,30490,0,0,Goladus,,,"Is this an undergraduate project or something?  It seems to be masquerading as a paper that is more serious than it actually is.<p>All the anecdotal stuff, opinions, and ideas are cool.  Where the author starts trying to put labels on things is where this paper falls apart.  Don't waste my time trying to subdivide people into groups like ""art fag"" and ""emo"" unless there is data and falsifiable definitions to support them.",1182794605

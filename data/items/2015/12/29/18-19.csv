Then in that terminal, run &quot;gdbserver&quot; and it&#x27;ll open up a gdb server on port 1234.<p>> Then, in another terminal, open gdb and run &quot;target remote :1234&quot; to connect to the gdbserver running in qemu.<p>> At first you&#x27;ll find that gdb has no fucking idea what&#x27;s going on. This is because it has no symbol data, so you&#x27;ll need to load your kernel binary into it with the &quot;file&quot; command.<p>> After loading your kernel symbol table, you should be free to roam around the inside of your kernel using gdb as normal.

The problem with that is that you really have no idea who you are buying something from, and if it looks too good to be true it probably is (there are lots of scams). Online payments aren&#x27;t really trusted in the country so you are expected to pay cash on delivery, which if you are lucky will take less than a week.<p>The weird thing is that there are some decent physical shops, I bought a Dell monitor when I was there for ~€180 and everywhere else I looked (even abroad) had it for €200+. Most things were usually at least  20% more expensive than the EU, which is weird as they have no tax there :-)<p>I bought a Roomba while I was there from Amazon DE, even including international express delivery and import taxes it was about €150 cheaper than buying it locally.",1451415301

An intermediate layer? The kernel is going to be written in rust. You can&#x27;t just put C code in there and expect it to work. I&#x27;m not even sure how you could transcode these drivers into rust considering rust uses a completely different memory model. I suspect a &#x27;real&#x27; RustOS will require new drivers to be written from scratch. From a mass adoption perspective, how would have linux worked out if Linus decided to write windows driver shims?<p>I wonder if its feasible to rewrite things like apache, nginx, php, mysql, gnu utils, etc in Rust but keep the linux kernel as-is.

Even Tesla automobiles are made in Silicon Valley, instead of someplace cheaper.  Why?  Simple: the talent is there, the technology is there (many of the supporting companies that make components and such), and there&#x27;s already a manufacturing base there which hasn&#x27;t been ruined the way it has in the Rust Belt.  The Bay Area is one of the main places to go if you want electronics manufactured in this country, but it&#x27;s also big for lots of other low-volume stuff.<p>You can&#x27;t just start up a manufacturing operation in some random, cheap cost-of-living city in the US; it doesn&#x27;t work that way.",1451414812

It&#x27;s more important that she be in a place where she can forge local connections, especially with places to do manufacturing.

It&#x27;s a shame too because there&#x27;s tons of old factories and stuff there that aren&#x27;t really being used well, and could be converted to low/mid-volume flexible manufacturing using modern automated equipment.  I imagine there&#x27;s a few factors working against this: 1) the very high rent costs make it hard to attract new people to the area (unlike the Bay Area where the tech people and tech companies are already there, and have been for decades), 2) the public transit isn&#x27;t that great unless you&#x27;re in or close to Manhattan (a lot of those old factories and such are in other boroughs or on the NJ side; anything in a decent place in Manhattan has likely already been renovated and converted into something else by now), and 3) the taxes and regulation probably stifle things too much (Silicon Valley certainly has its taxes and regulation too, but the local government has decades of experience in taxing and regulating in a way that mostly supports the tech economy and not driving it out).

The borrow checker learning curve is very high. Even if you understand the basics you won&#x27;t always know what macros and functions will be moving things until you run into an error. Lifetime management also requires a bit of time to grok. Some things that are simple in almost any other language can be frustrating in Rust, like someone wrote a book for how to write a linked list in Rust.[0]<p>My advice is that when you&#x27;re getting started with Rust, compile often. Don&#x27;t write a tome of code only to find out later it has no chance of compiling. It gets easier the more you do it, so don&#x27;t give up, but move in small steps.<p>[0] <a href=""http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/</a>",1451414181

For example, if one understands love to be significant emotional attraction, then this type of exercise seems likely to produce it.  However, if emotional attraction is necessary but not sufficient, (e.g., a person can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t romantically love another without a shared worldview) this exercise will only identify potential friends.<p>Also, to a great extent I agree that love is a choice, but it doesn&#x27;t strictly follow that if it&#x27;s possible to love anyone, then love must be a choice.  It may also be possible that we can fall in love with anyone by chance, but the chances for a love-producing circumstance are small, so romantic love is infrequent (somewhere between zero to a handful of times per lifetime).  On this view, Dr Aron only identified a mechanism for increasing the probability of romance.<p>For the curious, the idea that love (a belief, to an extent) is a choice falls under a hotly disputed umbrella position called &quot;Doxastic Voluntarism&quot; [1].<p>1.  <a href=""http://www.iep.utm.edu/doxa-vol/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iep.utm.edu/doxa-vol/</a>",1451413549

That&#x27;s really a great comfort when it&#x27;s needed. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t know if Flipkart even has something as prompt and useful. The rest of the players hide behind email addresses (no phone numbers) for customer support. If there&#x27;s one thing competitors must learn, it&#x27;s the <i>value of putting customers first and providing them assistance as quickly, as conveniently (for the customer) and as efficiently as possible.</i><p>> He (Piacentini) and Agarwal tell me Bezos has given them wide freedom to run India without his intervention, accepting that it could take years for the billions of dollars in investment to show returns. “His solicitations are never, ‘When will we make money?’ ” Piacentini says. “It’s always, ‘Are we investing enough?’ ”<p>I don&#x27;t know what to make of this. Maybe Amazon India is investing a lot in getting more sellers on board, in improving its warehouse and fulfillment operations, and marketing. But one area where it has been severely and pathetically lacking is in the &quot;findability&quot; of products and refinement of searches for what someone is looking for. I find it baffling, exhausting and extremely frustrating that Amazon India cannot even get &quot;sort by price&quot; correctly. If you know exactly what to search for, it&#x27;s possible that you might find it. If not, prepare to wade through multiple pages because a &quot;sort price - low to high&quot; may have some lower priced items later on or on the second or third page. It&#x27;s really shameful and unbelievably terrible that a company like Amazon cannot get this right! As an example on search refinement and filtering, you want to narrow searches only to hard drives that are 1TB and larger in size? Choose that option and find 500GB and other sizes also listed in the results. Wade through the list one again and waste your time. <i>I have repeatedly provided feedback on these for the last few years</i>, but have not seen any improvement at all. If anyone in Amazon.in is reading this or if Jeff Bezos bumps into this comment, you really need to get your act together seriously and hire some competent people who can get this done. You people don&#x27;t seem dedicated to what Amazon claims it wants to achieve. Stop wasting our time and putting us off your site! Look at Newegg if you want to see how to get product search and filtering done better.<p>On to other players, my recent favorite is Paytm (paytm.com). It&#x27;s also a market place. It does not have an Amazon India like customer service option (just an email address). Its product descriptions and details are glaringly inadequate in many cases. Its search and refinement options are close to Amazon India, sometimes better and sometimes worse. But where Paytm excels is in cashbacks on products. Unlike cashbacks from Amazon or Flipkart where you&#x27;d get a gift card to shop from the same site, Paytm cashback can be used for paying phone bills, paying cable bills, booking Uber cabs, buying bus tickets, and several other things from other merchants. Its digital wallet comes in handy to transfer money to or request money from other people instantaneously.<p>After Amazon, I think Paytm is the one to watch out for in the Indian space. It has deep pockets (all those cashbacks are really mind boggling) and will trounce others very soon. In my experience, Flipkart has always been the most expensive for products, and its push for the app only shopping part is highly immature and not thought out well at all. People who do compare prices across other sellers will migrate out of Flipkart. My experience with Snapdeal is very limited, but its somewhat similar to Paytm in lacking product descriptions and details. I&#x27;ve also read some horror stories about product delivery, fraud, etc., online (this didn&#x27;t happen in my purchase experience with Snapdeal though).",1451413112

Which, to me as somebody who&#x27;s spent a decent bit of time wrestling with the fact that, yes, I am incredibly privileged, is actually a little irritating--it&#x27;s jargon but many people try to wedge it in as a normal word, much like (but less egregiously than) how Stallmanites try to co-opt &quot;free&quot;.<p><i>> If a person wants to claim my background is privileged and that&#x27;s what enabled it all and stake claim to what I have as a result</i><p>Which <i>literally nobody does</i>. That&#x27;s the price of using jargon and expecting everybody to already understand you, and it&#x27;s what drives me batshit. Privilege is not referring to the genesis of your accomplishments. Privilege is referring to the difficulty slider. And very, very few people in tech are at &#x27;normal&#x27;, to say nothing of &#x27;easy&#x27; or &#x27;very easy&#x27;. And it is generally considered gauche to roll one&#x27;s eyes (and while I don&#x27;t think you necessarily mean to, I kind of get that vibe a little? not maliciously) at somebody who&#x27;s cranked up to &#x27;holy shit impossible&#x27;.<p>I am at &#x27;very easy&#x27; on that slider, even though I&#x27;ve had things that (to me) feel really shitty: my mom left town when I was ten, my brain doesn&#x27;t quite work right all the time, and I am punishingly introverted. But the sum of the things working for me that were an accident of birth--I&#x27;m white, I&#x27;m male, I was born in America--is so huge by comparison that I have it on <i>easy street</i>. And it doesn&#x27;t diminish me to acknowledge that. It does behoove me to recognize it and to help people who aren&#x27;t so very fortunate, though, which is why I get real salty around here when the cryptoracist and outright racist contingents start pontificating at length about &quot;the black mentality&quot; or other garbage thoughts.

A lot of that slowness is actually about the time I devote to reading (toilet time and bed time, essentially), the level of interest I have in the material (usually &quot;enough to continue&quot;), and a symptom of my out-of-practice reading skill, which leads to me primarily subvocalizing instead of reading, and frequently backtracking. Spending 10-15 minutes every other day reading at 200 words per minute does not make for a quick journey through a book.<p>After thinking of it in those terms, I&#x27;ve started to apply the idea that the more I read, the faster I will read (up to a point), to actively avoid subvocalization, and to devote real blocks of time to reading instead of fitting it in at the edges. I find that I end up reading closer to 400 wpm during focused time, and when I want to, I&#x27;m able to average 1-2 hours/day of a week. Spending that much time at 400ish words per minute makes books fly past.

Human languages are all ambiguous and their great efficiency depend on (intuitive) guesses -- in expensive guesses. We make guesses as we listen/read, but we do not commit our guesses; rather we modify our guesses as we accumulate further information.<p>Now imagine if we forbid ourselves to modify our guesses, you&#x27;ll see how understanding natural language a forbidding task ...<p>Compilation is essentially a guess of meaning with no room for modifications -- neither self-modifications nor post-hoc modifications. So it is doomed for inefficiency or un-trackable difficulties.<p>I believe the right way for the future of programming is multi-stage compilation -- with first meta-compilation followed with static compilation. Currently our compilation only refers to the latter. The meta compilation produces human readable intermediate result -- not much different from our current code in C or Java and it will be as easy to feedback from as we do today in C or Java. However the meta-compilations takes many guesses and quite often adventurous guesses but the coder can easily tell whether it is on-track or guessed wrong. When the coder detect the meta-compilation guessed wrong, he will simply modify his source code -- slight change styles or simply write the code in a different way (which is not much different from human communication when we say &quot;what I meant was ...&quot;); or, in a few specific or difficult cases, the coder may opt to directly modify the intermediate code (C or Java or any of current popular languages) -- not much different from natural language when we reduce to more specific way as we write laws and contracts.<p>I have been exploring such idea with MyDef -- a meta programming system -- and have been more convinced it is the more sensible way (than trying to make break-throughs in the mature field of programming languages).",1451412346

Look at the NYPD and how many innocent bystanders they shoot because of their 12-lb trigger pulls.  DA/SA are even worse because the first shot is double-action, so it&#x27;s inconsistent.  Both these designs should be banned from law enforcement use because of public safety.<p>The only thing wrong with Glocks is they only have the trigger safety, and no external safety (like the grip safety on Springfield XD pistols), so they misfire if you&#x27;re clumsy when reholstering and something gets into the trigger guard, and this has caused a bunch of cops to shoot themselves in the foot or leg.",1451412304

Both of the following can be (and are) true: Appalachia is a nexus of white poverty (and industrial decay), and institutionalized racism has lingering effects through the present day. The fact that racism existed (and continues to exist in some ways) does not preclude white people from ever being poor. Just like how your roommates&#x27; forefathers <i>may have</i> been discriminated against, but their parents managed to pay for their college. At the same time, your forefathers <i>may not have</i> been discriminated against, but you did not end up with a nest egg to work from. Local exceptions do not mean that systemic issues can be dismissed offhandedly.<p>While the income distribution may be screwed, in part, because &quot;politicians are bought too easily by corporations&quot;, how one could deny that institutionalized racism in the past has lingering effects on socioeconomic status for members of particular races into the present day is beyond me. You are pointing out real issues, but none of these issues mean that racism doesn&#x27;t (or didn&#x27;t) exist.<p>EDIT: Also, where are those people that make millions off of the discussion of racism?

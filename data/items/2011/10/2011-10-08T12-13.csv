Regular social media consumers, as much as we bitch about Facebook and Twitter and co, in truth find it convenient to be constrained to certain patterns; simply because the mental and temporal expense of making a communication pattern decision (along with the associated weighing of privacy risks etc) is greater than the perceived (low) value of each microblog entry / sharable communication.<p>Perhaps I'm just saying ""not enough people care enough"".",1318078442
3087806,comment,3087659,3087763,2,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yes, isn't our conception of data structures bound up fairly tightly with the available storage media and data buses? We have thought a lot about how to organize and retrieve data on tapes, and spinning disks, and random-access memories composed of discrete little bins, each storing a bit and addressed in rows and columns.<p>But we don't make extensive use of (say) analog computers, or computers with data buses having several million sub-channels. Hand us a machine employing such principles and it's back to square one. (Except for the lucky pure mathematician or two who got there first but whose work remains obscure right now, the way George Boole's work used to be obscure.)<p>And my stupid examples are just examples - I have no idea if the brain, or any bit of it, is best conceived of as an analog computer. Nobody knows what kind of computer the brain is like, except that it is almost entirely unlike the silicon-based digital computers that we build in the von Neumann tradition. And, presumably, when it comes time to discuss brain-based data structures they will turn out almost entirely unlike the structures in our digital-computer-data-structures textbooks.",1318078406

Normal people dont buy brand-new $700 smartphones each and every year. In the U.S. they buy them on two-year contracts, and they dont shop for new ones until their old contracts are over. So the iPhone that the 4S needs to present a compelling upgrade for is the 3GS, not the 4. And the iPhone 4S absolutely smokes the 3GS. Its crazy better than the 3GS. 2009 3GS buyers who skipped the iPhone 4  which Im guessing are most of them  ought to be delighted by the iPhone 4S.""</i><p>I normally disagree with Gruber on pretty much everything, but here, we both agree that it's insane to assume the next iPhone (4S or 5) was supposed to entice regular people to break their contracts just to get the latest and greatest. Seriously, who does that besides gadget snobs? For people waiting on the Nexus Prime, what phone are you currently using where you can just switch like that? Normal people buy phones on 18-24 month schedules, not 12. I still remember the outrage and sense of entitlement from original iPhone owners when the 3G came out. Surprisingly, AT&T conceded and allowed them to update after 18 months instead of 24.<p>You know what, I'm disappointed it wasn't a 5 with LTE and NFC as well, but I'm upgrading from the 3GS so the 4S is a great phone for me. When iPhone 4 owners' contracts expire, then they can get a 5 if they want.<p>Seriously, first world problems.",1318078086

3087783,comment,3087659,3087659,11,0,zerostar07,,,"Our insights in memory formation are still limited. The most studied candidate is LTP/D[1], the change of weights of synapses between neurons. Memory formation is a complex process though. While LTP can be induced with a short burst of spikes, its stabilization and maintainance depends on a sizeable number of molecules and genes. We still don't know at what level the memories may be stored, it could be the level of single synapses, groups of synapses, the level of single neurons or ensembles of neurons.<p>There are experiments involving fear memory that have shown that a fearful event can be ""stored"" in an ensemble of identifiable neurons, and even be turned on and off [2].<p>Then there are brain rhythms and sleep. Memories would become overwritten if they were stored in the same circuits over and over, so there are various theories about how memories are transferred to various parts of the cortex via coordinated rhytmic activity or sleep.<p>Closer to your question, the data structure that our serial thinking brain uses is language. We think, reason and communicate using it. Language has a tree-like syntax, but semantics are an unsolved problem. There is even a theory that suggests that brain rhythms may encode ""sentences"" into thoughts via neuronal oscillations[3].<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.silvalab.com.cnchost.com/silvapapers/ZhouNN2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.silvalab.com.cnchost.com/silvapapers/ZhouNN2009.p...</a><p>3: <a href=""http://osiris.rutgers.edu/BuzsakiHP/Publications/PDFs/Buzsaki2010Neuron.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osiris.rutgers.edu/BuzsakiHP/Publications/PDFs/Buzsak...</a>",1318077312

At that point, Im afraid, I no longer can regard that person as sane, i.e. in control of their own mind.<p>I am grateful for the work the FSF has done in the past, but Im also grateful for the work Steve Jobs has done.<p>Fanatical and extremist views lead to misery for the owner of the views and for those they effect. It doesnt matter if  the views are religious, political or just software licenses.<p>I dont believe you need to defend RMS - I can separate the ideas from the man. However the FSF has just had its reputation burnt severely and if they want to have any useful contribution towards the ongoing debate about how best to move the industry forward they should reconsider the ir public image.<p>That is if they want to increase their support and not end up a fringe group.<p>Im a great fan of open source software and have been for the last 23 years but lets be clear - the producer of software always has the right to choose what license they have, that is their freedom and that was the freedom that Steve Jobs like many others chose. Sometimes the license was open source (Darwin, WebKit etc.) sometime it wasnt, he chose, that was his freedom as the producer of the work. Freedom is such a loaded word but how often do we stop to see the freedom of <i>other people</i> not just our own when we cry its name.<p>When people cannot see the freedoms of others but only talk about their own freedom, be suspicious. Because their agenda is the most important thing to them, not the wellbeing of others.<p>I wish a long life to RMS, to the FSF and to open source itself.

3087776,comment,3087659,3087659,2,0,gmt2027,,,"Short answer: A graph.<p>All data structures are simplified graphs.<p>The state of the physical universe is a massive graph in which interconnected objects are themselves massive assemblies of graphs of atoms and the atoms are graphs of subatomic particles. It's graphs all the way down. The properties of all systems - physical, chemical, economic, biological - emerge from the interactions between simple connected elements.<p>My opinion is that all knowledge is representable as a connected graph. The disconnect between our computers and our minds arises from the fact that brains are categorically not numerical machines but graph processing and pattern recognition engines. Neural networks are the underlying hardware and, with the typical elegance of nature, these are also graphs.<p>It should be possible to build a graph based language. The basic ""Elements"" [SICP] are easy to realise:<p>1. Primitive Expressions are graph nodes. They have identity and not much else.<p>2. Means of combination. Graphs can be added, subtracted etc.<p>3. Abstraction. A graph can be abstracted into a single node. We have no problem looking at a complex assembly of components as a single entity.<p>Since Google and Facebook are two massive platforms whose value arise from direct interaction with planet-scale graphs with billions of nodes, would these platforms be easier to build if our computers were more graph oriented?

I think they can easily get away with that down to 200 pixels per inch or so (anecdata: I am myopic, but cannot really see the individual pixels on an iPad 1 Or current iPod touch)<p>I guess that the extra wiring needed for retina resolution means that you need more backlight to get the same display brightness. If so, one way to market a slightly larger display with say 250 pixels per inch would be by stressing it as having better battery life ('easier to see for the elderly' would work, too, but such a line does not fit Apple's image well)",1318075612

Not everyone else follows his definition, in fact I would say most don't. So much so that his pronouncements about this and that violates Freedom turn people off the movement.  His inability to function as public figure just makes it worse(ie his publication about SJ's death being a victory for Freedom.)<p>He has done some great stuff, that doesn't excuse his faults.  Basically him being the leader of the free software movement reminds me of the old line about being promoted to the level of greatest incompetence.  When people talk about him stepping down they mean as president of the FSF. They want to see the organization focus on being useful rather than being ideological because they think the ideological stance rather marginalizes the movement.  I know when I come into contact with free software 9 out of 10 times the FSF isn't involved.",1318075548

3087736,comment,3086793,3086793,2,0,Sandman,,,"While most of the commenters here discuss what Stallman said and what he actualy meant, whether it was distasteful or not, and whether Jobs was a modern day messiah who single-handedly changed the world we live in or just a smart business man with a very good sense of choosing the right people to create the products that he envisioned, I'd like to take a minute to think about what is actually proposed in this article - the forking of FSF. It's quite obvious from the article that the reason the author suggests something like that is not because his views on software freedom somehow differ than those of Stallman, but because he has issues with Stallman himself, or more precisely, with his publicly expressed opinions. He feels that they hurt FSF and free software in general. Isn't then the solution to the problem to, through some electoral process, replace Stallman and put a new figure at the head of FSF? Somebody more tactful, more careful about how they say what they mean (if that's truly the kind of a person memebers of FSF would like to see in charge)? Starting a new foundation with exactly the same goals as FSF, just because you don't like Stallman's public statements, seems pointless to me.",1318075451

They resulted in between zero (Wolverhampton, UK) and 8 deaths (one of the Chinese attacks) it seems (with a greater number of injuries but still typically much less than 26).<p>Yes, YOU are perfectly safe with guns at the moment.  But what if you are taking anti-malarial medicine or something else that throws you off balance?  Having a gun might make the difference between you shootings somebody (possibly yourself) and breaking your legs jumping of the roof or wounding someone with a knife.  And then we get onto the aggregate impact of those initially less stable than yourself.<p>4 shotgun shells might do a huge amount of damage in crowded area but in a crowded area someone can jump on you while you stop to reload.  In a sparsely populated area with a car to keep mobile in you can still do a lot of damage (Cumbria, UK 2010) but I suspect less than with more capable weapons.<p>In the UK there isn't anywhere to steal such weapons from apart from the police, army and criminals (but even criminals very rarely use or carry guns because the punishments for getting caught with them are high).  Also such theft would need planning and time in which he may have been caught or his state of mind may have changed.<p>There is no doubt in my mind that in the UK with our laws the death toll in an attack similar to the one last week in the US would have been lower due to the lack of availability of guns.  Children and carers/teachers may still have died but not in such numbers.  It is more arguable that there imposition of restrictions is too much of a burden on freedom for the benefit but saying there is no benefit is pure denial.<p>I find the self defence arguments unconvincing in general although it is hard to prove.  Transitioning from the US situation to the UK one especially given the geography of the US would be challenging and complicated<p>Genuine questions<p>1) In the US is his mother criminally or civilly liable for not preventing his access to the weapons?<p>2) Do you think that she should be?",1355745599

4931930,comment,4931288,4931849,5,0,leoedin,,,"Is it really naive math if it's informed by statistics from other countries? (Incidentally, statistics are something completely missing from your comment).<p>The article linked has the right conclusion. Banning guns works. The US saw something like 12,000 gun related homicides in 2008. The UK, with a 6th of the population, saw 39. Adjusting for population, that's over 50 times fewer deaths.<p>The grim truth is that banning guns in the US probably wouldn't do much. The UKs low gun crime is a result of a hundred years of high levels of control. It would take decades for any gun ban to impact on gun levels. However, statistics does show that if there's very few guns available, there is very little gun crime.<p>Rather than call something naive because you don't like it, why don't you provide statistics that support your argument? Do you have any idea how many crimes guns stop every year?",1355745493

Per day.<p>How does that work in the rest of the world then? I don't see thousands of people being raped here <i>per day</i>, so clearly something else must be stopping those rapes.<p>Really, guns are toys. Get over it.<p>The chances of you facing a life-or-death situation where a gun will help you are ridiculously overblown.<p>We're not trading off homicide vs one kind of mass homicide, that just brings things to the attention of a larger audience. The real trade off is citizens murdering other citizens with guns versus them not being able to do so or to do so easily. Sure there will be criminals with guns, they're not going to magically disappear. But there will be <i>far</i> less of them.",1355745315

4931881,comment,4931272,4931517,1,0,coolj,,,"> But that subsidy must come from somewhere.<p>It doesn't have to. Sure, subsidies can help the overall economy. But when you're falling off a fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling is rising, and your credit rating has already been downgraded, you have to be careful to take long term eventualities into account. If a significant number of US businesses are relying on government subsidies and programs to be profitable, and that funding dries up, we're gonna have a bad time. Such subsidies and programs are a tiny fraction of US spending, but they are also low-hanging fruit when it comes time for cuts, as compared with military, medicare, and social security spending. Not saying that will happen, but leaning towards austerity may have been a better choice in the long run than trying to ""jump start"" the economy, especially if we double-dip (knock on wood!). Time will tell. Interestingly, US and UK unemployment rates as of October 2012 are identical at 7.8.<p>> For every $.20 the widget company gets, some other company is taxed $.20<p>There are many sectors of government where spending can be reduced to increase available revenue for subsidies or tax cuts. You need taxes, tolls, tariffs, etc to generate absolute government revenue, but subsidies can be carved out of existing budgets without new taxation. The question of the right balance of both taxation and austerity, to maximally benefit the recovery of the economy, in both the short and long-term--that is the real issue. Seems nobody's discovered the magic formula yet.",1355744289

Do you think in 10 years that machine translation will be able to translate the following two (independent) paragraphs correctly?<p>Hikaru liked the old English teacher more than the new Scottish one. He still found it hard to understand the replacement's strange dialect as she droned away about the Battle of Agincourt, the Treaties of Aix-la-Chapelle, or how Paris 'deserves a mass', while the boyish Londoner had made far-away European history seem exciting.<p>Hikaru liked the old English teacher most of all. He moved to London only a year ago, and Mrs. Bane had helped him fall in love with the language. Her 40 years of service had not stunted her enthusiasm one bit, as she taught him and her other charges about the subtleties in Shakespeare, the humor in Carroll, and the epic power of Morrison.<p>In the first, ""old English teacher"" refers to the previous history teacher, who was from London. In the second, it refers to the teacher of English, who is at least 60 years old.<p>In some Germanic languages, the first is written as something akin to ""english teacher"" and the second ""englishteacher."" To translate it correctly, the translator has to read ahead to disambiguate the meaning. Which isn't hard, even for middle-school students. But it is hard for computers.<p>In other languages, gender is more important. In the first paragraph, it's very likely that the ""old English teacher"" is a man, and the new Scottish one is a woman. In the second paragraph, the ""old English teacher"" is a woman.<p>Is your claim that an automatic translation system will be able to translate these correctly to (say) Swedish or French, within 10 years?

They keep these bits very secret. When one needs to send an N-bit message to the other, s/he takes the next N bits of the blob and XORs them with the message. This is trivial to do and provably impossible to break -- except that making and sharing and keeping all that key data (the big blob of bits) is really inconvenient and easy to get wrong.<p>So, anyway, your system has the same weaknesses as any other one-time pad: you need new key data for every message you send, which means you have to make a lot of key data, share it with your partner in crime, and remember it for a long time, all without leaking any of it.<p>It's not <i>quite</i> the same as a one-time pad. You can get by with fewer bits of key than bits of message, provided there's still ""enough"" key. On the other hand, ""enough"" is quite a lot, much more than the key length of a typical symmetric cryptosystem like AES.<p>Anyway, I don't think this counts as ""by far the simplest encryption to understand"".

4931824,comment,4931575,4931755,3,0,geofft,,,"In my experience, ""don't roll your own crypto"" primarily means ""do not reimplement a well-known algorithm, because you are likely to get it wrong and likely to leak side channels out the wazoo"". I think most people have realized by now that inventing their own algorithm is a terrible idea. (Although certainly there are people who haven't realized that!)",1355742504
4931823,comment,4931774,4931774,1,0,lsiebert,,,"Bigger screens, and possibly augmented/virtual reality will allow looking at larger parts of code.  Code will be more modular.  Unit testing will be built directly into languages as an intrinsic part, like compiler optimization or GC. Code will generate to a larger extent (think intelisense or code completion, but with better understandings of what you are trying to do.)  Also code will self optimize to a larger extent.<p>touch screens, voice to text, and input methods similar to the Kinect will be used, but not the extent that people expect.  Keyboards will still have a big place.  Voice is too ambiguous and slow for much of programming, and touch screens and kinect style interactions require you to move too much.  However, expect that touch pads will be more popular, and that they will have screens in them.<p>simple user facing programming languages for different interfaces will be omnipresent, and their lack of unification problematic.  Many things will be programmable, and user programmable, and while unification efforts for commonality in how you program your fridge/toaster/tv will exist, they will not be enough to keep things from fragmenting.  Voice interaction to program things will not progress as much as they could given the capabilities of voice recognition, simply because of a lack of well formatted connections between devices.<p>More documentation will be automatically generated by expert systems.<p>Saving power will be a bigger focus for programs, especially  in enterprise.  In moble Batteries will still not last as long as you want, though e-ink and better chips will help. concurrency and networking will be very important, with the rise of always on connectivity, and the limits of moore's law.<p>That's my best guess.",1355742421

They do not understand that restricting the right to firearm is a way for the state to take more control. The problem is, maybe you never had any problem, but when you have, most of the time, the state isn't there to protect your ass. \nAnd ... Why not to forbid cars as well? Knives, glasses, alcohol, tobacco, chimneys and so on ...? You totally dumb guys. People are not self-responsible? Learn them to be, rather than resricting privacy to  protect them from themselves  ...\nBut ... It won't happen. I'm living in a socialist country and I know how you, leftists, are thinking ... You only admit you mistakes when it's way to late. It's a shame.",1355742328

4931819,comment,4931575,4931714,17,0,geofft,,,"""If you roll your own crypto you're an idiot"" is technically correct, but discouraging in all the wrong ways and worse for everyone in the long term. I've been a teaching assistant for MIT's introductory graduate crypto class, and I still don't consider myself qualified to implement core crypto algorithms. But I've seen -- and used -- entirely too many crypto implementations that are obviously poorly written in my eyes.<p>I would love to see a solution to the fearmongering that still keeps people aware of their mistakes. Perhaps public development is the answer -- many eyes make all bugs shallow, so all we need is more people who feel like their eyes are qualified. How many people have actually read the OpenSSL or gnutls or GPG source with an eye to its security?",1355742287

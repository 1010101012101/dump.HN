First off, any bona-fide academic ought to have respect for the truth, not deliberately set out to build his carreer on lies. One has to wonder: does he also encourage lies in academic publications? Does the publishing outlet, i.e. traditional paper journal versus the internet justify that much  difference to the principle of being honest in research? I think anyone this confused about the necessity of the truth should not be an academic. If I was his colleague, I would support steps to have his tenure terminated forthwith.<p>Secondly, the techniques prof. Kelly teaches and employs are classical disinformation tools, as practiced by Hitler, KGB and other such illustrious preceptors of his. Presumably some of his college funding is intended 'for the public good'. I really question prof. Kelly's idea that expanding the skills base in the disinformation field is for the public good.<p>Thirdly, and most importantly, one has to ask: what is his real agenda? Clearly it is to disable/discredit/damage/destroy the free exchange of valid information on the internet. If there ever was a real 'information terrorist' it must be him.",1337158579

You can often reject a hypothesis quickly if you are fast enough at doing some computations in your head.<p>So yes, more teaching of how to identify problems and break them down is a good idea. But you <i>also</i> need to be rock-solid in those elementary but fundamental skills, and you don't get there without a lot of practice.",1337158573

3981080,comment,3979809,3980141,3,0,actua11y,,,"These ""wet"" labs usually do not have many people who are enthusiastic about computers in the programming, text-only sense.  Usually there is one or two people that know some stuff and they do all the technical stuff for everyone else.  It's not uncommon to find people who are actually quite computer phobic in these labs.  The general interest in computers is prefering Mac's to PC's and that's about as far as it goes.  If you start talking up some programming solution to the wrong person you may actually alienate them.  \nThe problem extends to much of the software that is written too.  There are some command line suites that do batch processing, e.g. for sequences, but much of the software is point and click.  And that's the problem.  No one expects the typical lab user of these programs to be versed in using the command line and doing batch jobs.  Everything is mouse-driven.  Even if the back end is powerful, the front end is always a slow GUI.<p>This just slows everything down.<p>Another shining example of this sort of thing is audio engineering.  You have programs that are designed as GUI's that look like physical pieces of gear.  You move the mouse around to adjust turn knobs, switches and sliders and adjust settings.  Extremely cumbersome.  But this is how they expect users to be comfortable.  Then companies started selling physical consoles with real knobs, switches and sliders to control the software.  It's comical.<p>The touch screen trend is not going to help people get comfortable with the command line.  And the key to realy fast computing is using a command line and batch processing.  There is no way around it.  When you are pointing and clicking, you are just sending a signal that began as a text instruction in the code anyway.  Why not just start with the text command and skip the point and click?",1337157871

Most of these widgets are embedded using SCRIPTs which have access to the parent page's DOM structure. For Twitter/Facebook they can basically access anything on your page.

That sucks. It may still be possible to circumvent these attacks.

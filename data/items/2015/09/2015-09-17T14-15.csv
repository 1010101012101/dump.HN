Creation/dissemination of child pornography is not a statement of opinion (and its malicious too, which would exempt it from protection); creation/dissemination of child pornography is an act that directly and tangibly harms others. Same goes for pirated content. I know there&#x27;s lots of HN readers who believe that libertarianism and meritocracy will solve the world&#x27;s ills but cmon man, you really think child pornography should be protected speech????<p>American jurisprudence has taken a troubling tack on free speech, choosing to take it in a very libertarian direction. In fact the biggest loser of such libertarian free speech ideals is the American political system: shameless attack ads that cheapen political discourse, the fusion of money and political favour (PACs), and the rise of populist rightwing hate-mongers who routinely attack minorities and inspire intolerance. Funny, a piece of legislation originally created to protect the citizens from their government is now being used by citizens (politicians) to destroy the government....<p>I&#x27;m a firm believer in free speech but it made a lot more sense 300 years ago when the government could easily control your speech. In 2015, with the internet and mobile phones, the government would have an incredibly difficult time preventing people from expressing their unfavourable opinions. Maybe it&#x27;s time to stop living in the past and instead create legislation that reflects the world we live in today.",1442501934

It seems like a good idea that people should strive to start by laying out a landscape of where their ideas fit in, how speculative they are, potential biases, alternative ideas, etc., because then people can get some perspective.<p>Self-reflecting based on this: I should have started by saying that I probably have a bias for humility because it seems that the more I learn, the more I feel I was poorly prepared when I was younger by adults with their often grandiose, myopic, and uncomprehensive explanations about life, and I think this did me great damage.

10233687,comment,10232595,10232595,0,0,moron4hire,,,"ANNs are great for the right application. But I&#x27;m starting to fear &quot;Deep Learning&quot; is the new &quot;Big Data&quot; buzzword.<p>I believe ANNs are Turing Complete, meaning they should be able to compute anything (EDIT: + &quot;that is computable by any other Turing Machine&quot;). The questions are, can a training regimen be created to create the right ANN to solve &quot;any&quot; problem, and if so, is it an efficient means to solve that problem?<p>For example, it&#x27;s fairly trivial to build an ANN to spit out the right results for a given polynomial function, i.e. &quot;f(x, y, z) = ax + by + cz&quot;. Knowing the polynomial function ahead of time, you just generate a ton of input/output sets and feed them into the training of the ANN, and then from there on the ANN will spit them back out.<p>The problem with that is, you didn&#x27;t learn anything new. You didn&#x27;t learn how to solve a new problem. It&#x27;s somewhat useful for teaching people how to program ANNs, but I personally think it&#x27;s garbage for teaching how to <i>understand</i> ANNs.<p>ANNs make more sense when we already have the training data, but we don&#x27;t know the underlying function that maps input to said outputs. In the trivial case of the polynomial function, if someone were to hand us the training set, we could use an ANN to figure out what the polynomial must be.<p>Except--for this particular example of a polynomial function--this isn&#x27;t very efficient. For a polynomial of N terms, you only need N+1 sets of IO to trivially use algebra to determine the function. You can use any of the readily available linear algebra libraries to do such a thing. In fact, I wrote a project for a client that does just that: it uses a basic matrix library to crunch a set of GPS data to create a quadratic formula estimation of curves in roads, so that model can them be resampled, continuously, sans noise.<p>And if that function is not just a simple polynomial--if, say, it includes sines and cosines and square roots, etc.-- then the ANN is going to have to be large enough to include in it ad-hoc, arithmetic estimations of sine and cosine and square roots sufficient to give the right answers. It might even include several different estimating functions just for sine just because our mystery function requires more than one sine operation. It might even have corner cases where it gets the answer wrong, because you didn&#x27;t have a sufficiently large data set for it to &quot;figure out&quot; things like the fact that sin(x) is approximately x for small values of x. <i>If</i> one knew the right formula (and yes, that&#x27;s a big if), it&#x27;d be significantly more efficient to write a program that computed the values correctly.<p>All of this is not to poo-poo on ANNs. ANNs are great tools for when we don&#x27;t know the function and when the function is sufficiently non-trivial to discover. The polynomial example is like trying to kill a fly on the wall with a swarm of nanonmachines designed to evolve and learn how to construct a flyswatter (which is part of the reason I dislike it as a learning tool). But write traditional code to do Optical Character Recognition, I dare you. ANNs are just highly specialized. Think of setting up your ANN like defining the full width and depth of the space of all possible programs that you&#x27;d like to search for the program that solves your problem. You then use feedback to &quot;walk&quot; across that space until you find something that looks like your desired program. We&#x27;re entering an era where we have the memory and distributed processing capabilities to crank out some rather large ANNs. For some problems, we end up training a computer to write programs for us that we could have written on our own. This can impact the number of requests you can handle in a given amount of time.<p>Of course, that is not necessarily bad, either. &quot;Throwing money at the problem&quot; is not the wrong solution when you have a lot more money than time. Technology is supposed to serve us, not the other way around. Why spend a week discovering a formula to map your data when you can train an ANN in a few hours? And perhaps you don&#x27;t have very high requirements for request handling. Maybe you only need to process one image a minute on your particular system. Have at it.<p>But you really, really need to know that is the case before you jump on the ANN bandwagon. You have to know what you want out of the ANN. If you don&#x27;t have that ability to look at a set of inputs and express a desired set of outputs, then ANN isn&#x27;t magic pixie dust that will solve that for you. If you have experts in your particular field telling you that your particular problem cannot be easily modeled, then ANNs might be helpful for you. If you are new to your field and you think &quot;let&#x27;s try an ANN&quot;, you&#x27;re probably going to have a bad time. If you end up with an ANN that is estimating a <i>relatively</i> trivial program, and you&#x27;re trying to provide a SaaS offering that is meant to scale to thousands or millions of concurrent users, the ANN approach could seriously harm your ability to scale.",1442501740

Whereas false arrest is an arrest contary to known fact.<p>In cases of bomb threats and security breaches, qualified immunity is going to provide  significant leeway when dealing with IEDs. Since most high-schools have strict anti-weapons rules, you can get arrested for a swiss army knife. Again, this is not the same thing as an apologia for a perp walk of a 14 year old. But if you want to see a &quot;false arrest&quot; look at what happened to the Blake last week in NYC. That was an unreasonable takedown of a private citizen with no effort made to establish identity; and a violent arrest for a non-fleeing suspect in a non-violent crime, etc.<p>In this case you are dealing with an &quot;IED&quot; vs an &quot;Improvised Timekeeping Device&quot;, and since the former often includes the latter as a component part, its not completely baseless. This is why you cannot fly with liquid water on an airplane--the security forces cannot distinguish (on-sight) &quot;legitimate water&quot; in a clear bottle from several chemicals (aslo clear) than can be combined into an explosive IED that will puncture a pressure hull of an airliner.

All you can say is that you don&#x27;t know what research there is on water levels.<p>The Wikipedia entry at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_myth"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_myth</a> gives some information about &quot;localized water levels aligned with older civilizations&quot;.<p>One of them concerns the flooding of the Persian Gulf, with a link to <a href=""http://z6.ifrm.com/4802/123/0/p1011060/Persian_Gulf_Oasis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://z6.ifrm.com/4802/123/0/p1011060/Persian_Gulf_Oasis.pd...</a> which posits that the gulf was an oasis during the Ice Age. If you read the paper you&#x27;ll see the commentary on page 870:<p>> The notion that coastal regions are more attractive than adjacent  hinterlands  because  of  moderate  climates,  abundant groundwater,  ecological  diversity  and  fertility  on  land,  and marine  resources;  that  such  regions  have  been  critically  important  as  pacemakers  of  socioeconomic  and  demographic change  throughout  prehistory;  and  that  their  role  has  been largely ignored or misjudged because of sea-level change, has been  widely  canvassed  by archaeologists during the past decade  both  in  general  terms  and  in  relation  to  the  Arabian Peninsula (Bailey 2009; Bailey and Flemming 2008; Bailey and Milner  2002;  Bailey  et  al.  2008;  Erlandson  2001,  2007;  Erlandson and Fitzpatick 2006; Westley and Dix 2006; Westley et  al.  2010).<p>which gives several papers you can track down.<p>On <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_myth"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_myth</a> you&#x27;ll see mention of &#x27;localized flooding at Shuruppak (modern Tell Fara, Iraq) and various other Sumerian cities&#x27; which is believed to be a &#x27;localised event caused through the damming of the Kurun through the spread of dunes, flooding into the Tigris, and simultaneous heavy rainfall in the Nineveh region, spilling across into the Euphrates. In Israel, there is no such evidence of a widespread flood.&#x27;<p>If you then wade though the various sites which claim this is evidence of the Biblical flood, you&#x27;ll come across sites like <a href=""http://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/reflections-on-the-mesopotamian-flood/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/reflections-on-the-m...</a> , which point out that there&#x27;s a long history of flooding in the area:<p>> There was one such appalling disaster for example, in 1954, when an exceptionally rainy spring combined with the melting snows of Armenia and Kurdistan, so swelled the Tigris River that it submerged the low-lying plain for hundreds of miles, and all Baghdad was in imminent danger of destruction. ...<p>> All in all, therefore, it is justifiable to conclude from the present evidence, as does Max Mallowan in his recent thoughtful and comprehensive article, “Noah’s Flood Reconsidered” (Iraq, vol. XXVI, 1964, pages 62-83) that the Mesopotamian Flood-story, and the Old Testament version based on it, was inspired by an actual catastrophic but by no means universal disaster that took place, not as Woolley claimed, immediately after the Ubaid period, but some time about 3000 B.C., and that it left its archaeological traces in Kish, Shuruppak, and probably at a good many other places yet to be discovered.<p>So there are a <i>lot</i> of changes in &#x27;localized water levels&#x27; in places where there are ancient civilizations. The question this becomes <i>what kind</i> of changes are you looking for?<p>Another well-known example of post-glacial flooding of settled human lands is Doggerland. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerland"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerland</a> .<p>Still another is Sundaland. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundaland"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundaland</a> . Quoting from <a href=""http://phys.org/news/2008-05-dna-evidence-overturns-population-migration.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2008-05-dna-evidence-overturns-populati...</a> :<p>> Dr Oppenheimer’s book, based on multidisciplinary evidence, writes about the effects of the drowning of a huge ancient continent called ‘Sundaland’ (that extended the Asian landmass as far as Borneo and Java). This happened during the period 15,000 to 7,000 years ago following the last Ice Age. He outlines how rising sea levels in three massive pulses caused flooding and the submergence of the Sunda Continent, creating the Java and South China Seas and the thousands of islands that make up Indonesia and the Philippines today.<p>In other words, there&#x27;s a large amount of literature and research on the topic, and as easy to access as most other published scientific literature.<p>You write about caving robots and ground penetrating radar. That would provide little useful data for the cost. Ground penetrating radar does not work through water, so cannot find submerged sites. While geophysics is important for archaeology, ground penetrating radar mostly used to prioritize manual inspection. And if you read the article about the research in the Indian Ocean you&#x27;ll see that isotope analysis of core samples an other techniques were very important in the research. I think your views on &#x27;automated exploring bots&#x27; is only an expression of techno-optimism.",1442500281

It&#x27;s the system functioning as designed.<p>In the history of the US, there have been only 27 amendments. Two of them cancel each other out, and 10 were introduced at the beginning, so that&#x27;s 15 amendments over 226 years. We&#x27;re 23 years away from the last amendment, only 8 years above the average. It&#x27;s not &quot;more impossible&quot; now to pass an amendment than it was over the past century. Maybe more difficult, but not near impossible.<p>It&#x27;s not even the longest time between amendments in the nation&#x27;s history. After the Bill of Rights, amendments 11 and 12 were mainly to resolve procedural issues. It then took over 60 years for the next amendments to be passed, all in response to the Civil War, granting the freed slaves freedom, citizenship, and the right to vote.<p>After that, the amendments were mostly to resolve procedural disputes again, such as presidential term limits, how we elect senators, start of terms, and Congressional salaries. The major amendments after the Civil War all had to do with voting rights: for women, for those aged 18, and for those who couldn&#x27;t afford a poll tax.<p>The one time we tried to use the Constitution for social change, it failed miserably. Prohibition resulted in a sharp increase in crime, didn&#x27;t stop people from consuming alcohol anyway, and ultimately resulted in amendment 21 being ratified to repeal amendment 18 and end prohibition.<p>None of this points to dysfunction in the system to me.<p>People don&#x27;t often forget that the Constitution contains methods for amendment. See: the Marriage Amendment that was floated around in the 90s, and people today saying we&#x27;ll need a new amendment to limit the power of the super-PACs.<p>You linked to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. I&#x27;m sure if a future Congress sees this as a procedural issue pressing enough to bring up as an amendment, they will. Besides that, there is not much pressing at the moment that requires a Constitutional amendment. That an amendment has not been added in 23 years and one is unlikely to be added is not a sign of dysfunction of the system. It is simply business as usual, no new amendments needed at this time.",1442499510

10233450,comment,10231967,10232644,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"This is my thinking as well. Everytime I hear the &quot;make all drugs legal now&quot; people make their various fantastic arguments it reminds me of the kids I grew up with, who mostly did about the same amount of drugs as each other. Half of them recovered and the other half more or less became burn-outs. I don&#x27;t think we remotely understand how LSD use affects us, especially non-neurotypicals and those with mental illness or sub-clininical issues.  The latter group developed this hard to quantify attitude, like this dead look in their eyes that never really went away and is matched by just a real lack of creative thinking and motivation - both of which they had before drug use.  I think drugs are much more dangerous than we think, even pot, for at least certain demographics; especially young people who are still developing. Yeah, 30+ year old guys don&#x27;t have much to worry about, but there is rational and non-biased research showing this and I fully believe my friends have been victim of liberal drug attitudes. I believe Duke university found a 70% IQ drop for regular pot smokers compared to their peers by age 35 and other studies have found lowered executive function, increased risk of mental illness, and a messed up reward processing system.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not advocating for the status quo, but if things like pot, shrooms, or MDMA or even LSD become legal, there needs to be strict age and dosage limitations. The idea that they&#x27;re a &quot;fix all&quot; is dangerous and disingenuous to me. Maybe in a clinical and controlled setting there could be realistic positive outcomes, but certainly not in a recreational one.<p>Meditation is safer but takes more effort than eating blotter paper. As a long time meditator, its raised my quality of life significantly. Sadly, when I try to sell this onto some of the people mentioned above I get nods of approval and then a &quot;Let me get high first before I try it,&quot; comment which pretty much invalidates whatever benefits you can get. To them, drugs only make things better, in fact, life is kinda terrible sober. Not to mention, I&#x27;ve never had a &#x27;bad trip&#x27; or paranoia or anything negative with meditation. Its incredible that we have this simple tool available to us at all times, but dismiss it because its weird or because people think they can take a shortcut to retraining their minds with drugs.  Hint: you can&#x27;t. Everything worthwhile takes some level of labor. Instant fixes don&#x27;t really exist.<p>Sometimes I wonder if baby boomer drug liberalism has cost us a few Einsteins and Newtons. Or what wonderful things John Lilly or Tim Leary, both men who I consider near-genius level, would have come up with if they didn&#x27;t go down the burn-out path. Its a scary thought. The entire boomer drug experiment didn&#x27;t pan out, did it? By the time Leary and Lilly were in their prime years, they became obsessive weirdos going on about trans-dimensional aliens and such and morphing into empty-suited but profitable celebrity caricatures.

It&#x27;s a unique sort of power that can only be obtained illegally, and at some great moral expense. This Faustian device makes for intriguing plots.<p>Who else can have a mountain of cocaine? Who else can execute business with such brutality? What other line of work involves Zero Halliburton cases stuffed with Benjamins, to go with high-powered handguns and sharp suits? These are proxies for power that a pleb like myself can barely begin to comprehend.<p>There&#x27;s a scene in the Godfather Part II that I really like, when the nervous money-grubbing landlord comes into Don Corleone&#x27;s office and gives him cash so that a previously disagreeable tenant can stay in his inn. The absurdity of the scene belies Corelone&#x27;s power like the tip of an iceberg, and it&#x27;s visually interesting to see a normal-looking guy wield such mysterious power.<p>This is echoed by the common &quot;crime lord is the manager of a pizzaria by day&quot; trope (Breaking Bad, Drive, Road to Perdition), where a seemingly weak front has a hidden-dragon kind of vibe.<p>To summarize, I think that &quot;psychological distance&quot; theory only carries the audience halfway, in that they don&#x27;t feel the revulsion towards mobsters because they don&#x27;t deal with them personally.

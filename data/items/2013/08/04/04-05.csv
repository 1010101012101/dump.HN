Full size helicopters minimise this by switching to NOTAR and fenestron designs.\nGear noise can be substantial on older designs of model helicopter, direct-drive is extremely rare, I think only Robbe ever made a direct drive design, cheap, strait cut gears are more common.

This is obvious, and brings into question your own understanding.<p>It really isn&#x27;t. Trespass is about <i>land</i>, though in our modern day world of two-story buildings, it is more exactingly about <i>space</i>. See: <a href=""http://thelawdictionary.org/trespass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thelawdictionary.org/trespass/</a><p>In order to work trespass into your convoluted example, you had to call upon several other ancillary crimes, like breaking and entering and the oddity about exploiting someone else&#x27;s property, which I don&#x27;t think is even codified.<p>Personally? If you want to figure out how to fix patents, I&#x27;d suggest dropping software as an example and going over to food recipes.<p>> Back to patents.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly care about your clever table-turning unless you actually get the argument to hold up in a court of law. Patents are problematic: this is obvious to virtually everyone working in the tech industry and many more besides. Philosophical tricks are useless until legally recognized. It&#x27;s nice to be able to play semantic word games, but it&#x27;s an entirely different league to be using legal language.<p>Also, you seem to be under the misapprehension that I was defending patents.

Freedom Hosting had been a target of Anonymous&#x27; Operation Darknet from the beginning--they&#x27;re well-known for refusing to take down exploitative sites.  Operation Darknet is, itself, a pretty interesting phenomenon: Anonymous hacks onion sites, then hands over user information to the FBI for investigation.  Anonymous does what the FBI legally can&#x27;t, and in exchange they&#x27;re not prosecuted for it.  I can&#x27;t find the article now, but I recall reading an interview with an FBI agent in Wired or Ars or some such where he described the anons as &quot;Internet Superheroes&quot;. (sic)<p>That, in and of itself, is kind of curious.  Curiouser?  One of the original Op Darknet principals was Sabu.  You may remember him as the hacker the FBI rolled and got to bust up LulzSec.  Sabu was turned by the FBI on June 7th, 2011.[1]  Operation Darknet began several months later, in October, 2011.[2]<p>The obvious question, then, is this:  Did the FBI use Sabu to entice Anons into attacking child porn networks, thereby evading the laws against them doing it themselves?  Did they use the fact they turned a well-known hacktivist to help them deal with criminals they lacked the legal tools to go after?  Is this arrest the culmination of those efforts?<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabu_(hacktivist)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabu_(hacktivist)</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/anonymous-attacks-child-pornography-webs/231901499"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/anonymous-at...</a>",1375590599

6154590,comment,6154278,6154542,11,0,IgorPartola,,,"Exactly. As far as I can tell, you cannot connect an external monitor to a USB port and have a GPU drive it. Thunderbolt serves a different purpose than USB: it is an interface between a small number of external devices and a small number of hardware components. The fact is that it can only at this point be useful for three things: displays, drives, and Ethernet. USB is what you use when you do not have another option. It is nice since it can support almost any kind of device because the protocol is not burnt into hardware, but of course the downside is that it has to implement the host side of things in software. Anyone trying to use a &quot;USB video card&quot; to play an HD video will notice how much of a toll it takes on the CPU. And when the CPU is fast enough not to be bothered by a 1080p video, we will instead be talking about 3D 8k video.<p>Basically, it is nice that USB just got faster, but IMHO direct access to the specific hardware (disk controller, video card, etc.) will always win.",1375588945

    The design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. It is more important for the implementation to be simple than the interface. Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design.<p>Correctness:
    The design must be correct in all observable aspects. It is slightly better to be simple than correct.<p>Consistency:
    The design must not be overly inconsistent. Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, but it is better to drop those parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances than to introduce either complexity or inconsistency in the implementation.<p>Completeness:
    The design must cover as many important situations as is practical. All reasonably expected cases should be covered. Completeness can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality.

I'm skimming the paper now but this looks a lot like ""we played with some <i>in-silico</i> models and came up with a nifty thing""<p>Edit:  Christ, I don't even know where to begin.  Seriously.<p>First of all, there is no mention of the fact that microtubles don't innervate dendritic spine heads.  Actin is the primary cytoskeletal support for synapses.  I can think of several plausible explanations to get around this fact, but they don't offer any which immediately put me on edge for the whole paper.<p>Second, there is zero in-vitro experimentation.  It is extremely possible that none of this happens anywhere, let alone in the brain.  Granted, in-silico experiments are often used to guide future benchwork...but I would have liked to see some preliminary wet-bench tests.<p>Here is a gem from the paper:<p><i>MTs appear to have intrinsic electro-mechanical vibrations, e.g. coherent oscillations in the low megahertz range. [...] Signal propagation will be influenced by, and depend on MT lattice vibrations and related effects.</i><p><i>In LTP, high frequency inputs (e.g. 50 to 100 Hz) are required for prolonged post-synaptic response. Kumar et al [58] showed that memory formation in dendrites depends on synchronized inputs, with an optimal frequency near 50 Hz. Density and patterns of CaMKII-induced tubulin phosphorylation in post-synaptic MT lattices would depend on frequency and synchrony of inputs.</i><p>Wait, what?  They are correlating electro-mechanical oscilations (MT vibrations) with electro-chemical oscilations (synaptic firing)?<p><i>Scale-free implies self-similar information patterns repeating at different spatial and temporal scales (following 1/frequency power laws). Similar to fractals and holograms, scale-free structures and processes arise commonly in nature and technology, and are inherently robust and resistant to disruption. In the brain, evidence suggests neuronal network structure, temporal dynamics, and representation of mental states are all scale-free, with self-similar patterns repeating at various temporal and spatial scales and locations [68][71]. Interference patterns of periodic, coherent reaction-diffusion waves in cytoplasm and larger spatial scales could account for scale-free information patterns regulating biological systems including the brain. Microtubules can generate three-dimensional reaction-diffusion patterns [70], and we suggest such patterns operate at multiple time scales to regulate biological systems.</i><p>Translation:  There are fractals in the world and we see the brain structured in certain ways, so those patterns must apply to smaller things, right?  We showed some dubious computer modeling of microtubules vibrating and a kinase phosphorylating.  Therefore, the vibrations are encoding brain information.  QED.<p>There's more, but I need to get to work.  Let me just put it this way:  there is a very good reason this paper is not in Nature Neuroscience.",1340977623

The alternatives are already compelling.  They are equal to or better than PHP in every single respect.  Yet they are not as widespread.  The idea that pointing out the flaws of PHP doesn't help is absolutely incorrect.  Demonstrating the flaws of PHP, and the practical impact that has on producing useful software has been very successful for me in convincing PHP users to try something sane.  I find only a very small minority of PHP programmers are actually unwilling to try anything else, most of them will give something else a shot if you simply demonstrate why it is in their best interests.  Some people certainly get upset when you point out that they are using a bad tool due to ignorance of better tools, but most are able to get over themselves and realize the better tool will make their life easier.<p>The overall effect of convincing individuals to use better languages is that those alternatives do become as pervasive as PHP.

I get page clutter that is parsing my content.<p>Google's business is advertising. They make the vast majority of their money by stopping me from doing what I want, and placing ads in my way. The evolution of the search results page shows this clearly as many cases about 80% of the screen real estate is covered in ad content.<p>It is important to note that Android is not an altruistic effort to help humanity. They believe mobile will be the next wave of computing and need a new model for serving ads. Items like Siri worry them because a user skips Google and is provided no ""helpful ads"".<p>To say they don't have a history of this is wrong. Search, YouTube, Maps, Mail, and Android itself are all heavily ad covered now and all signs point to this growing.<p>3. They're pairing down after they launched them. This is my concern. Devs adopted some of these services to watch them die. Now they've launched many new items which will be dead within 1 year.<p>I'm not being hyperbolic. Then tell me:
 How is Video different than YouTube?
 How are Maps and Earth distinct?
 Why does News exist when I can use the keyword news?
 Where should I put my online content: Blogger, Orkut, Sites, or Google +?
 Talk is very interesting, but why should I use it alone instead of Gmail Chat or Google Hangouts?
 Panoramio, Google+, Picasa, or Orkut for sharing photos?
 Fusion Tables looks fun, but why wouldn't it be better to launch a public Google Spreadsheet?<p>Finally, Google has seemingly paired down the list of products on their product page, but most products aren't even listed! Where's play, drive, or any of the items they announced today. To say they don't have a problem here is drinking the kool-aid so hard you might not wake up.",1340976319

I come to this site to improve my self and read about what brilliant and amazing things you all do. Now you have a reference.<p>I use PHP on a daily basis, have been for years. I am a freelance developer who has been able to carve out a living with a lot of hard work and a lot of luck. I just met the right people at the right time. Over the last 7 years since I started developing professionally, I have seen nothing but people shitting on PHP constantly. I am in no way suggesting PHP is a perfect language, but I still never get the hate. It just seems so ivory tower to me sometimes. Let's look at reality.<p>I'm starting a small project for a client. They are keeping track of all their scheduling and doing all their reporting in excel. They want to move this to the web with basic security so the right people can see the right information with ability to access it from anywhere. That's it. You know what works for that? PHP does. It works fine and it works on almost any server in the entire world with no issues. I don't need a .vimrc file with a million special configurations, I don't need a hot new framework where my time is spent figuring out how to do basic CRUD operations, it won't matter if PHP is statically typed or not, it won't matter if... you get the idea. I just need to start developing and getting this project done so this business can start saving time and money. <i></i>That's<i></i> what matters most to me.<p>PHP works, and it works damn well for <i>millions</i> of situations every day. No one is suggesting you use PHP to build a super computer. If your project requires something different than use something different. PHP is not the ""Nickleback"" of programming. PHP is useful. PHP is practical. PHP is easy, and that's not a bad thing. Facebook, the biggest site in the world, uses PHP. Think about that.<p>Finally, let's use his tool analogy. PHP is a double-clawed hammer. What if your job was to remove nails from wood all day? What a wonderful tool a double-clawed hammer would be! You wouldn't have to worry about which way the hammer is facing! That would save you real time and real effort. It's the right tool for that job. Tools are about how you use them. If someone uses a tool incorrectly it's not the fault of the tool.<p>PHP can use improvement. Every language can. I imagine a meeting of otherwise incredibly smart people sitting around in smoking jackets and sipping fine brandy standing around with smug smiles on their face. ""PHP is horrible!"" One will say.  ""Hmmmm... Yes... Quite..."" A small laughter emerges. They all pat themselves on the back and enjoy their intellectual circle-jerk. All the while countless developers are using it every day for the right reasons making real applications that help real businesses save real time and real money. Laugh at me all you want, I get Christmas cards from my clients. They like me just fine.",1340976155

However with the level of optimization offered by compilers today, these days assembly seems mainly relegated to where it's fine-grained control allows for better performance in extremely performance oriented parts of code. An example of such would be SIMD code where highly fine-tuned assembly code often runs circles around the compiler generated equivalent, as proven by simply comparing x264 performance with or without assembly optimizations.<p>Personally I haven't done any assembly programming in atleast the past 6-7 years but I still get the urge now and then to program in it again. However, even though it's unlikely that happens, my assembly experience has given me a thorough understanding of how the computer works at a basic instruction/memory level which has been extremely valuable when I want to create optimized code in higher level languages (like C). So yes, while learning C is certainly worthwhile even if you are going to write in even higher level languages, learning or atleast graping the fundamentals of assembly is in my opinion even better.",1340975816

And I still think PHP is a decent language for introducing people to programming.<p>I've written web apps in: Ruby (both Rails and Sinatra), Javascript (Node.js with Express), PHP (my own framework, CodeIgniter, and eying Laravel), and been maintenance programmer for a C CGI application. I've written desktop and CLI apps in Object Pascal (Lazarus and Delphi), to CLI apps in Go, C++, and probably a few I've forgotten. I've done Object Oriented, Evented, and to some degree Functional programming. I am a polyglot programmer.<p>The problem is bashing PHP. As Jeff said, PHP's power is its ubiquity and its near omnipresence. It runs on just about any platform with any configuration, with almost perfect consistency. For the most part there's no switching extensions or libraries because of the OS. Develop wherever... deploy wherever... get almost an identical experience without lifting a finger.<p>In fact, I have great hope for the future of PHP with 5.3 and 5.4 as they (finally!) have added and improved upon the language, and have begun to cull deprecated features. The problem for PHP right now is twofold: web hosts refusing to upgrade in a timely fashion, and legacy codebases that refuse to be rewritten. Both these are demanding backward compatibility, and slowing the advance of PHP.<p>I'm tired of the bashing of PHP. Bashing, in general, is the absolute least effective way to communicate your point.

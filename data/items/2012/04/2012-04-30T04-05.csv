3908081,comment,3907626,3907999,6,0,jmspring,,,"I'm not sure why but the phrase ""Are you 'startup friendly' (appropriate expectations of work hours, pay, and equity)?"" just rubs me the wrong way.<p>Joining a startup is a two way street.  If you are considering joining one, you should do as much diligence (or even more) than they are doing on you.  I, personally, love startups -- the energy, the diversity of problems, the ability to learn and grow.  But, I've also been bitten by all the glitz (early in my career during bubble one) as well as people that thing ""it's a startup"" is an excuse to demand above and beyond efforts on a regular basis.<p>In general, you are going to work more at a startup, you may or may not get paid less, and you will need to weigh the whole work/life balance thing, most likely.  You might be asked to make a tradeoff between equity and salary.<p>The tangibles you have control over (salary, time you are willing to commit, etc) are the ones you need to weigh.  But, you also need to understand as much as you can about the expectations of those in management.<p>Poor planning, for instance, should never be excuse by ""this is a startup"" -- I don't mean pivoting, I don't mean tweaking as new information comes along, I mean those people that can't make up their mind on what constitutes the expected deliverable by a particular date.",1335761664

COBOL?<p>Anyone have a good guess?<p>In any case, <i>yawn</i> to the eliminate the programmer stuff. Been there, done that, history repeating itself for the n+1 time.<p>here's what's always happened and what will happen again: the framework being presented as a programmer antidote will come up short to business requirements. then there will be a  scripting layer built on top (if not already). And <i>boom</i>, you will need a programmer to implement these scripts for customizations.  So in reality you are just adding an abstraction layer to the mix.  Those layers are why we don't program in assembly anymore, they are why we don't manage our own memory anymore (yeah lots of unmanaged tech out there, etc). That's also why we don't compile stuff anymore (see previous disclaimer). Etc.  Just more of the same stuff, one more abstraction layer.",1335761458

3908071,comment,3905878,3907783,1,0,Locke1689,,,"<i>I don't really follow your logic. There are very good reasons why you wouldn't be able to install the same package in the same way on Linux and OS X. (For starters, homebrew isn't true package manager in that it's not a one-stop shop - it can't even handle critical system updates like apt-get/pacman can!)</i><p>I'm arguing that we should have an OS switch in the same way we have an architecture switch. If we assume that our PM can handle application packages as well as system packages then we should also be able to use it to install application packages on any OS which support it. For example, python should be installable on everything from Windows to BSD all using the same ""pm install python"" command. Packages will be marked as explicitly supporting OSes.<p><i>I think PKGBUILDs are the best of both worlds, because they allow system-specific package management to coexist with application-level packaging - two related, but subtly different problems. PKGBUILDs are general-purpose enough that they can do pretty much whatever you need them to do, assuming that they're well-written (which is our assumption when comparing any packaging method), and they're flexible enough that you can modify them to fit your specific system.
The only real problem I see with PKGBUILDs is that, at least on Arch, they're community-developed, which means that they can be out-of-date or variable in quality. But that's no worse than the situation if you were to install from source, anyway (which is the alternative), and that's more a byproduct of the way that the Arch community is structured than the PKGBUILD system itself. I'm sure if Red Hat or Canonical suddenly decided overnight that they'd start supporting PKGBUILDs, things would be different (and would have their own problems, likely...)</i><p>Agreed.<p><i>Without looking, I'm 99% sure that PKGBUILDs are bash, not sh, but I'm also 99% sure that 99% of the PKGBUILDs I've ever installed are sh-compatible. And I don't think that's the worst thing in the world - in this day and age, you have to be able to handle sh for any Unix-like OS, and you have to be ready to implement the appropriate interface for any other OS that you want to be compatible (or to throw compatibility to the wind altogether, like Windows does).
Second, since many PKGBUILDs are really just convenient wrappers around the already-provided application distribution mechanism, I don't see how this is that bad at all.</i><p>This was my main complaint with PKGBUILDs. A bash/sh dependency hurts on non-Unix OSes. I'd rather Python than sh.<p>I also admit that, for the most part, I absolutely hate sh and all its derivates and view them all as dirty hacks, so this is probably just innate bias.",1335761402

Generally, from an individual researcher's point of view, they are not charged for the telescope time.

Any method of server-side encryption for email (and many other) systems as we currently understand them has inherent flaws.<p>The simple fact is that key material is accessible in RAM, and even if it weren't, the data still must be decrypted at some point, and once the server is compromised, you can likely capture that decrypted data.<p>That's not to say you shouldn't do it -- it helps prevent accidents like unwiped drives getting out, and might be a reasonably effective obfuscation against some attacks, but it just isn't secure in the same way that real end-to-end encryption can be.",1335759669

There's little to be gained by encrypting it after the fact.<p>Besides that, what key would they encrypt it with?  Something from your password?  What do they do with email you get while not logged in?  How do you build a search index?  I'm actually building something similar, and even after a lot of effort, there's tons of corner cases that simply <i>cannot</i> be protected, so it seems a reasonable guess that gmail does nothing special to encrypt your data.<p>[edit to add that once you include oauth in the picture, I think the encryption story starts getting really fuzzy.]",1335759590

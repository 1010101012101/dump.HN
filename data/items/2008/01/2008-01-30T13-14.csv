Don't give them any compensation unless you're setting up a formal board of directors. If you're doing that, Guy Kawasaki in his book describes a board as having these types of people:<p>1) Customer- someone who understands your target market
2) Geek- Reality check guy for dev, and the tech expert
3) Dad- calming influence on the board, experience and maturity
4) Tight-Ass= The person who pushes for totally legal and ethical practices.
5) Jerry Maguire- Mr. Connections who can help you with whatever problem you have.<p>As always, as long as your products are taking off, everything else will fall into place.",1201701460
106821,comment,106398,106398,0,0,ced,,,"So, is this the right thread to talk about actual language design?<p>1. I think using cons to represent lists is an ugly hack. I mean, why should a cons only hold 2 elements? Why not generalize them to n elements, and call them lists?<p>2. Has anyone tried unifying macros and functions? The distinctions between the two is one of the worst part of Lisp IMO, and I don't think there should be anything fundamental about it.<p>Otherwise, it's nice to see a new Lisp of course.",1201701041

106805,comment,106716,106716,0,0,ericb,,,"I put worrying about this (and paying for lesser domains) in the pointless waste of time and money box. It's more important to test ideas fast and cheap than to protect a non-business from unlikely squatters. Who goes to the .org site first? No one whose business I'm worried about losing. The investment has zero return, and protects you from nothing if you have the .com. I changed names 4 times for my last idea; I'm very glad I never bought the variant domains.<p>Edit: On top of the reasons above--if you get to the point where you've trademarked your name and succeeded, I think you can kick people off the squatter domains through legal means.",1201698495

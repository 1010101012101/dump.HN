I meant it in the sense of ""aggressive negotiation"". Demanding a positive reference not to blow something humiliating is not extortion. If you demand <i>money</i> not to blow something, you're breaking the law, because there's no connection between the payoff and the threat (exposure). However, with a reference, it's ""we're going to part ways, but it's best for both of us that we tell the same story, so let's get straight about what just happened"". That's how you present it. Not really extortion.<p>Your advice to OP has a lot of value and on the whole I agree with what you are telling him to do. OSS contributions are a really good idea for him.<p>However, I still contend that an ""odds and evens"" mixed strategy will perform better than full disclosure.",1364158775
5433551,comment,5433187,5433187,12,0,hristov,,,"This is a great story! By the way, I do not think the author of the article (Epstein) got away with anything. I am pretty sure Nabokov knew very well that he had not read the book. It is not a coincidence that Nabokov gave him a job reviewing movies afterwards. I think Nabokov read his essay, knew he was describing the movie, but nevertheless liked his writing and thought that Epstein was especially good at describing movies.<p>So Nabokov either thought that he would use Epstein for his own amusement or (more likely) he would try to secretly develop Epstein's talent without telling him that he likes his writing as too much self confidence can be disastrous for a young writer.<p>It seems that Epstein was luckier than he imagined. Although, it also seems that Nabokov gave up on him eventually.",1364158755

I've talked to the border patrol over the phone about this before (with relation to re-entering with an expired passport). As an American citizen, you can't be denied re-entry into the country. Without proper documentation, you might get tied up at the border while proving you are an American citizen (though I'm not sure what lengths they would go to to figure out if you really are a US citizen without even an expired passport though).",1364158725

5433530,comment,5432713,5433285,4,0,summerdown2,,,"There's nothing wrong with sleep, but meditation is a little different.<p>Think of it like this: say you're at work and have an important meeting in a few days. If you're anything like me, your mind will constantly return to it. You play out scenarios in your head about how it will go. If you're a natural pessimist, you can imagine all sorts of failure modes.<p>So let's say your normal response is to spend ten seconds of fantasy, in which time your heartbeat rises, stress hormones begin circulating in your blood, muscles clench. You may even mutter to yourself.<p>So then, you meditate. It's a bit like training yourself to spot when your mind wanders. Now you only drift into useless fantasies for five seconds before you catch it and bring yourself back to the present. Only half the hormones enter your blood. Your heart rate is lower. Your stress is less.<p>Anyway, that's one benefit I've found.<p>There are others, too. Many studies have found that the key to creativity lies in taking a break from work and letting the mind relax. Well, I often find I get my best ideas during a meditation session. Like all other ideas, I try to bring my mind back to the present and ignore them, but after the session, they're still there for me to use.<p>I could get into the spiritual side, too. You don't need to believe in a god to see that there's times when you feel more connected to other people and to nature. I don't know why, particularly, but meditation seems to make this happen more often. Speaking for myself only, it's a very pleasant feeling.",1364158444

It's extremely liberating when you first experience the sense of control that comes with being able to let go, and you realize you've been spinning your mental wheels pretty much non-stop with no awareness. It's challenging at first - it's uncomfortable and anxiety provoking - and the benefits don't come for a few months, but I have noticed a marked improvement in my ability to regulate my mood and state of mind as I'm way more aware of the train of thoughts going through my head.

What is more disappointing is how the newcomers seem to trade in for beta-quality NoSQL databases that promise them of better reliability and scalability out of the box, which is simply not true[1]. For instance, databases like MongoDB promise the developer to not worry about scalability and focus just on their code, while it does some things under the hood in a terrible way [2].<p>PostgreSQL is one of the few databases that supports SQL and can actually be less painful to scale than MySQL. Also, the recent versions have enormous performance boost that can silence the SQL critics, IMO.<p>If you are interested in testing out PostgreSQL for your project, you might want to develop on the WAPP stack and give it a shot:<p><a href=""http://bitnami.com/stack/wapp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitnami.com/stack/wapp</a><p>Disclaimer:<p>I was a mongoDB developer too and I loved it so much. I loved the fact that I could skip running db migrations on my rails app and I can focus on just coding, instead of worrying about scaling. But, it was a terrible trade off. First of all, you can't use NoSQL for everything. It was a very painful lesson that I learned the wrong way. 99% of the time, you want to use SQL, because most use cases can be executed perfectly with SQL db's. Next, some db's have a terrible architecture and design decisions under the hood, mainly to improve their benchmarks (seriously!). For example, turning off write-safe by default... :cough: :cough:
Last but not the least, SQL for the wrong use case complicates things and ends up adding redundancy into the database (like storing User details inside multiple collections, un-avoidable, especially when you are against embedding documents). The worst trade-off using a NoSQL database is the analytics part - ""Hey db, show me the list of users who are from the United States and who have subscribed to Plan X and who are the highest paying customers and who love chocolate pie"" 
SQL - ""Here you go."" NoSQL - ""Sorry sir, not possible. Possible, but possibly a nightmare.""<p>If you want to build a 'scalable' app for your next big thing and don't want the scaling hassles of MySQL, which actually scales extremely well already[3], you can use PostgreSQL.<p>Cheers<p>[1]Scaling is <i>hard</i>.

Thus, Filburn's production could be regulated by the federal government.</i><p>By this reasoning, even free open-source software is interstate commerce, if it has a commercial competitor. Imagine a federal law restricting FOSS, as part of an economic stimulus for the software industry.<p>(edit: My FOSS analogy is actually too weak! You wouldn't need to distribute anything.

The reasoning is that a firetruck (especially a pumper truck) has a suspension that is designed to carry much more weight than a bus so you would not be as constrained in what you could build on top of it.<p>Jay Leno did an excellent column about how amazing fire trucks are in terms of durability.<p>The OP said that ""fire trucks"" weren't designed to drive on the highway at highway speeds, which is a bit of an over generalization. The National Forest Service for example has a number of trucks in California that are tasked with driving up and down the state to fight wild fires. They not only drive on the highway, they end up with a couple million miles on them before they are retired.<p>In terms of practicality (there isn't much :-) but a ladder truck has the ability to put you fairly high up somewhat ""away"" from the truck. (although an inexperienced operator could easily tip over their truck if they weren't careful) and they have those pretty awesome hydraulic stabilizing legs. I sketched out briefly a sort of 'circus tent' RV where the tenting was connected to a ladder truck's ladder which could then extend up and allow you to stake out a tent around it. A number of issues there, from the outgassing of the truck into your tent :-) and the ladder has a specified end load that it can move around which is often less than 500 lbs so you end can't really hoist canvas, you would get away with light nylon at best.<p>But in terms of interesting vehicles to own I agree with the author that there is a certain cachet there :-)",1364155400

Do you know how hard it is to figure out causality from observational data?

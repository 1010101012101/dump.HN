589123,comment,588703,588703,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"While New Zealand is not a world hub of IP, this should be closely watched. It will be extremely interesting to compare the terms of the 'rebooted' legislation with the existing incrementally altered system. I can't guess whether it will cut down the typical 'function creep' of incremental legislative extension or result in a major rebalancing in the same direction as the function creep (ie on behalf of copyright holders). I'll be surprised if it results in a tilt in favor of consumers.<p>To the extent that HN has members or members have contacts over there, I hope someone will advocate alternative models such as Creative Commons licenses and similar, and argue on behalf of their legal utility. Another copyright issue that is little discussed is that of authorship. In Europe, if I write a book and you buy it, I may sell the copyright to you outright but I retain the right to be identified as the author. In the US no such right exists.<p>I'm kinda stating the obvious here, but I hope people will pay close attention to this. It's not often the legal codebase is thrown out and rewritten, and this is a 'use it or lose it' situation for NZ citizens, whose participation and reaction will be closely studied by legislators and copyright holders elsewhere.<p>Given the depressing manner in which US legislators have catered only to large copyright holders to undermine the original intention of the copyright process and basically cut off the natural flow of IP into the public domain, this has long-term implications for all of us.",1241210870

As a professional, you have to act with a certain degree of professional detachment and care. Your words <i>matter</i> in ways that mine do not. You charge <i>money</i> for your words, because they have a power and authority that mine lack.<p>But what you seem to be saying is that we, the general public, have a choice: We can discuss legal issues amongst ourselves. We can not discuss them at all. Or we can abandon the discussion of legal issues to lawyers and people who can afford lawyers.<p>Does anybody really think it would be a good idea for the public to just be quiet and leave the issues of IP law to credentialed experts? Isn't that just how abominations like the Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act happened in the first place? It turns out that large media companies can afford to hire a lot more experts than the EFF can. And that just because a lawyer understands more about law than you do doesn't mean he's more inclined to use that power in your interest than you are.<p>Lawyers understand the law. But citizens <i>make</i> the law (very indirectly, of course). And citizens suffer the consequences of laws. So it's our job to care about laws. Even if our mental models of how they work are a little... rough.<p>(Of course, it would be great if the public had better grounding in legal education, just as it would be great if we all knew more quantum mechanics.

589109,comment,588996,588996,0,0,mdasen,,,"This article could also be called skilled and unaware.  While the authors assert that those who are unskilled lack the metacognition to realize that they are unskilled, the skilled also seem to lack the ability to realize just how skilled they are.  Each study shows the top quarter vastly underestimating their ability.  In each study, it looks like once you get to the 65th percentile, people start underestimating their ability.  While there is some variation in people's perceptions of their abilities, most people seem to think that they just fall in an above average range whether they're brilliant or not.<p>This is really interesting and has broad implications on how we interact with the world.  For example, if you're brilliant, but perceive yourself as above average, you won't think you're entitled to brilliant pay - just above average pay.  Likewise, someone who is far below average, but thinks that they are above average will likely believe that they are entitled to above average pay.  And that has implications both social and political spheres.<p>However, this might just be another manifestation of the middle class effect that we see all the time.  People, generally speaking, always see themselves as middle class in America regardless of where they actually fit into the social hierarchy.  In both situations, one of the factors might be that one's peer group is usually less of a cross section of society and more a cross section of one's own class and therefore it's likely that you'll be somewhere in the middle of that smaller grouping.  Likewise, one's peers are also likely to be of the same intelligence level and therefore that becomes skewed.<p>Before I get jumped on with that last bit, I did read the part where the unintelligent not only misplaced their percentile, but also couldn't figure out how many they got wrong.  But that's also influenced by where you think you placed relative to others.  If you think you placed above average and the exam was meant to test a variety of people, you're decently likely to assume that you scored better than you did.<p>Well, maybe I'm full of hogwash.  Still, it's really interesting to think about what it means socio-politically when people assume that they're in a different place than they are (intelligence, production, etc.).",1241210381

People have been paying to hear music or see flickering images on a screen for a long, long time.  As long as the transaction was centered on a physical object, like a CD or a DVD, we psychologically attached the value to the object.  When the object became an inconvenience, we realized we were paying for something intangible.<p>So we got cleared that little cognitive hurdle, no problem.  Now it's normal to buy music on iTunes.  This New York Times article does its best to confuse the issue by concentrating on buying intangible items that are <i>virtual representations of real objects</i>.  That drives home the contrast between real and virtual in a way that music doesn't, since it's easy to accept that music is intangible, but we're used to thinking of otters and swords as tangible items.

Tech is often very insular, because all you need are some hackers. My start up, for instance, doesn't need salesmen, or scientists, or accountants, or even a receptionist or whatever else. I really only care about one or two skill sets, so I could just assume that every salesman alive is a moron and still succeed just as well.<p>I feel like it doesn't exist so much in many broader industries. Great businessmen realize that success is about getting people who are good at what they do and giving them everything they need to succeed, and then staying the hell out of their way. In a biotech company, for instance, some of the skill sets required are science, sales, accounting, politics/lobbying, manufacturing, etc.<p>Successes in an industry like that sort of requires you to be willing to admit other people are as smart as you and know more than you about many things.",1241208635

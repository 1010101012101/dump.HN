2476413,comment,2474504,2475922,3,0,prodigal_erik,,,"Auto-sharding is when you have a RDBMS that sees ""SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c2"" and knows how to choose a plan which minimizes data going back and forth to make that happen. NoSQL instead makes you plow through n^2 records doing every join the hard way in the app, which is about as far from automatic as you can get.<p>The problem is that the people who actually handle this correctly charge so much that I've never even seen their products in live use. Meanwhile free SQL databases are still really bad at it. But choosing an API that deliberately restricts you to only the worst possible query plans is not going to be part of the solution.",1303541876

But they can't, so if you want your code to go faster, you have to find a way to parallelize it.<p>This started happening in earnest about 20 years ago in the supercomputer market, which is where the Tera was sold. About 10 years ago, it started happening in desktop CPUs (check out Herb Sutter's article about ""the end of the free lunch"") and now it's starting to happen in embedded microcontrollers, with the Parallax Propeller and the GreenArrays chips.<p>As it happens, the Tera didn't lose to faster single-threaded supercomputer CPUs. By the time the MTA came out, even the most stalwart defenders of the fast-single-threaded-performance approach, like the Cray SV1 and the NEC SX-5, had succumbed to the necessity of CPU parallelism.  But the approach that was taking over the supercomputer market at the time was actually far <i>more</i> parallel, and far more difficult to program efficiently --- NUMA machines and then Beowulfs.<p>So that's why I don't think it was single-threaded programs that made the Tera fail in the supercomputer market.<p>The question of how to meaningfully parallelize XML and HTML parsing, compilation, text processing in general, and web browsers are very interesting indeed.

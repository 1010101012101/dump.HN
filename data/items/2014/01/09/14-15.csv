You can&#x27;t both claim to invent technology that seriously affects society, and at the same time dismiss talk of politics as irrelevant. A technology can either be irrelevant or be political (if you ever wish to understand technology, I suggest you read some of the many discussions of the politics of the washing machine; or the fork).<p>What I find most fascinating about some of the less ideological BTC discussions is the belief that a neutral technology (a cryptographic algorithm) can replace social contracts. I&#x27;m not claiming it necessarily can&#x27;t, I&#x27;m just saying that this belief shows not only disdain for government, but an Aspergerish rejection of social structures. It&#x27;s like saying, I don&#x27;t want to put people in charge because I don&#x27;t trust them, and I don&#x27;t want even to talk to others in order to resolve disagreement; instead, I choose to take all decision-making agency out the hands of humans and place it in the hands of an algorithm that can provably never be swayed, because that is the only thing I can trust.<p>Regardless, there is nothing technical about a story of a small group attaining concentrated power over a decentralized currency.",1389279391

You&#x27;re using the negative definition of freedom, which is the lack of explicit restrictions on behavior; the logic you expose only holds under that particular school of thought.<p>The GPL is instead defined on the tradition of positive liberty, which defines freedom as the number of options freely available to each person to choose. There&#x27;s a very real risk of those being reduced by permissive licenses, as you can no longer ignore network effects, as negative freedom (being defined over individual atomic actions) does.<p>History shows us that if you allow open source code to be relicensed as proprietary, the competitive advantage of companies building and selling products with enhanced features tend to displace the original project, which gets abandoned. This happened to Unix, to Mac OS X, and is now happening to Android. If this continues for an extended time, the whole ecosystem evolves and the old software becomes unusable, greatly reducing the total options that users can effectively perform - not by an legal or coercive restriction, but because of pragmatic impossibility. There are permissive projects where this doesn&#x27;t happen (at least for a while) because of the economic incentives of remaining close to the free+open project, but the risk is always there.<p>What good is the permission to run the original, abandoned version of a software project if all the available hardware has been locked and is uncapable of running it, and it&#x27;s impossible to modify it to support the modern functions that are available in the proprietary platform and required for any productive usage? Those are very real threaths, and the GPL was designed to combat them (as a reaction to the first time they happened on a large scale). Avoiding this &quot;reduced total available options&quot; scenario is what GPL projects call freedom, not &quot;reducing the number of restrictions&quot; definition that you use. Not a problem of rhetoric, but of chosen vocabulary.",1389279290

There is not enough volume (yet) to make an internal exchange practical, there would be too much risk at the moment, at least for my taste.<p>When I started on this project, Mt.Gox was pretty much the only choice, because of the large market share (> 80% at the time) and the necessary volume and small enough market spread. Their withdrawal delays are annoying, that&#x27;s true. It does not affect me directly, since it&#x27;s only Bitcoin in and Bitcoin out for me, where so far Mt.Gox had pretty much never delays. But it does distort the market price, which means you get a great rate when you fund your Bridgewalker account (because BTC is overvalued on Mt.Gox) and get a bad rate when you spend it (again, because BTC is overvalued on Mt.Gox) - so in the end it kind of zeroes out for you as a user, but it&#x27;s still confusing for the user, why you have this offset.<p>There aren&#x27;t many alternatives though. Bitstamp could be one, but I&#x27;m worried that they still might run into regulatory issues down the line. Also none of the other exchanges offer real-time streaming updates about changes to the order book, like Mt.Gox does, which is very useful to keep track of the market. Kraken could be an interesting alternative to Mt.Gox, since they seem to run a solid operation. If they add such a streaming API with real-time updates about the order book and maybe get some more volume, then I would consider switching the backend over.<p>Or someone else does it first - it&#x27;s open source now, after all! ;-)<p>Or maybe you could hedge the whole thing just with some financial swap construction, but I haven&#x27;t looked into that too much and it&#x27;s not my area of expertise.

If you&#x27;re working on bits and pieces of information that are hundreds of bytes in length, low cache count is no excuse to be slow.<p>That&#x27;s why the software and protocol you use on a mobile device should be very much different.

This can&#x27;t be blazing fast for such a low powered device, especially if it&#x27;s a library API thing you use to make an app on top of it.

So why aren&#x27;t there languages that allow you to move to static as your codebase matures? TypeScript adds optional typing but doesn&#x27;t quite go the whole way unfortunately.<p>I think that&#x27;s a good idea. Maybe have a dynamically typed language, with other features that make dynamic languages good for using in a REPL and with more of a investigative programming style. And then have (another) language which is more static and have simpler runtime semantics, so that the language is easier to reason about but has less features that make it interactive. You might not even need the interactive features at a certain point, anyway, but it might be a problem if you want to move back to the more dynamic part in order to experiment with stuff. But that could perhaps be solved by making it possible to use the static language as the dynamic one, but not vice versa: for example if the difference is only in that the static one has type declarations and the dynamic one does not, simply ignore the type declarations and run it as the dynamic language, or defer it to be checked at runtime [0].<p>Someone in another thread brought up Typed Racket, which IIRC is implemented in Racket itself with macros.<p><a href""http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide"" rel""nofollo"">http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/</a><p>[0] in GHC Haskell you can use a flag to defer type errors to be checked at runtime:<p><a href""https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/DeferErrorsToRuntim"" rel""nofollo"">https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/DeferErrorsToRuntime</a>",1389278236

Is the mining you&#x27;re mentioning unrelated to another one sending your BTC?<p>I&#x27;m handwaving here, and this is how I understand it.<p>Yes. It is verifying transactions. Making sure that transactions are valid and people aren&#x27;t double spending or spending money they don&#x27;t have. As a reward for doing this miners who find blocks generate bitcoins from nowhere, the reward is currently 25 bitcoins for finding a block. It is luck based, you have to find the right hash. You just keep hashing away until you find the right one, I believe.<p>It&#x27;s called &quot;mining&quot; because it&#x27;s a reference to say mining for gold or other items of value. You can look in the right spot, but there&#x27;s a bit of luck involved.<p>>How can people share a &quot;computer cluster&quot;/minin pool (that is what you mean right?). Do you mean that one person or company owns such a huge cluster and let&#x27;s all members share &#x27;virtually&#x27; a single &#x27;Bitcoin wallet&#x27;?<p>More or less. They rewards are divided based on how much computing power you put toward finding that block (shares). Once it is found the rewards is divided up proportionally. In reality some pools have slightly different reward schemes, but I&#x27;ll make it simple here. So, if the reward is 25 bitcoins and I put in 10% of the &quot;effort&quot; to get that 25 bitcoins, I would get 2.5  bitcoins even though I am not the one who found that block, someone else in the pool did. That lives on the pool&#x27;s wallet. I then go and log into the pool&#x27;s website and transfer those bitcoins from the pool to my wallet. Some pools have an auto transfer so that when you get to a certain amount it automatically goes to your own wallet. Those coins do me no good at all in the pool&#x27;s wallet, until they are transferred to my own wallet.<p>Pools aren&#x27;t run by companies, not that I&#x27;ve seen.

The Nexus 5 is a good magnitude faster in every way (I can&#x27;t find specific parity-version benchmarks, so perhaps I&#x27;ll fire both of them up and give it a go), moreso in some ways like the GPU, and is as powerful as some desktops that people still use in business settings.

Minus these it just made for a frustrating experience for a lot of users. Add the fact that sites were loaded with obnoxious, taxing Flash ads, and it just gave users of Flash-enabled devices a very negative experience. It also reflected poorly on the product as a number of popular tech sites compared Android and iOS web page loading times, the former seriously hindered by the loading and overhead of Flash.<p>There were later changes to make it activate on click, but that just made it even more of a usability burden.<p>In a way, at the time this whole debate was raging, iOS users got to enjoy essentially a free &quot;adblock&quot; in the absence of Flash.<p>I have to entirely disagree with any notion that smartphones are underpowered: I am currently working on a very intense real-time image processing system and with each iteration I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m increasing the scope and featureset because the performance continually blows me away.

I am currently running an unintentional experiment with my sleep cycle that very few grownups with responsibilities have the luxury of attempting. Since I&#x27;ve had a bad cough for more than a few weeks now, I&#x27;ve stopped worrying about anything except getting better. As a result, I stopped trying to go to bed at a set time or waking up with an alarm. I stay up as long as I want, I sleep as much as I want, I take as many naps as I need, and I code whenever I feel like.<p>Yesterday I woke up at noon, ate my first and only meal at 6pm, fell asleep at 7.30pm, woke up at 1.30am, and coded until 7am. I am a bit sleepy now and will fall asleep soon but I am in no hurry to any work, do chores, or sleep. Since physical exertion makes me cough, I&#x27;ve been pretty lethargic. Here&#x27;s some interesting things I realized:<p>1) Freedom from guilt is refreshing! Not feeling guilty for sleeping in until 2pm or watching cartoons from 3pm until 1am is elating. Far too often we live our life in a certain way because that&#x27;s how we are supposed to. As long as I am not dropping the ball on my responsibilities (bills, social commitments, work projects etc.), there is no reason for me to feel guilty.<p>2) 24-hour cycle is definitely not for me. In fact, my sleep cycle isn&#x27;t even periodic. It&#x27;s very random. Some days I&#x27;ve stayed up 20 hours without feeling tired and some days I&#x27;ve slept 16 hours. My only concern has been feeling good. Obviously being sick and taking cough meds skews how I feel and how often I want to sleep/stay-up but even the days I barely took meds, I would fall asleep at 4pm only to wake up at 9pm for absolutely no reason.<p>3) I am procrastinating less! Technically, I am not procrastinating at all since I have no schedule so whenever I do anything, it is done on time. I do have some self-imposed deadlines but they are not stringent. Being able to meet them while still living on a completely carefree schedule feels wonderful.<p>4) I am listening to my body - more so than ever. I am not fighting my urge to sleep or eat or stretch. While this means I don&#x27;t have to eat my meals at a set time, it also means not ignoring that I am hungry at 4am. Instead of forcing myself to do things because it&#x27;s time, I&#x27;m waiting to feel hungry or thirsty before I eat or drink. The revelation to me is that this hunger feels very different from the &quot;it&#x27;s 12pm so it&#x27;s lunch time&quot; hunger. This is definitely a sample size of one issue but I feel like I am eating the proper amount I need instead of over- or under-eating like I generally end up doing when I wait too long to eat or have to eat much sooner than I want to.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to hack my body into doing anything fancy. I just want to stop being miserable and my condition has improved considerably over the last week. I don&#x27;t plan on living like this forever though I have to admit, the psychological benefit of this carefree-ness during a typical grouchy period of sickness has kept my spirits high throughout.",1389277034

A process can be represented as a sequence of objects. Take a function taking some arguments, one can describe this function in it&#x27;s entirety by describing each sequence of objects generated by each possible input. Then if one wants to recreate the operation of the function one simply looks up the appropriate sequence of objects. A function then becomes a mathematical object in the abstract. In the same way some mathematical object can be described as the result of some process. Take the definition of the natural numbers, an object 0 is defined and a successor to this object to the next object is defined. This operation defined recursively sets up the whole natural numbers. The description of the natural numbers is the result of the evaluation of this function recursively applied, or the infinite application of this function. Since the study of mathematics is the study of these abstract objects and these objects encapsulate those objects which we can produce in the physical world through some process, mathematics by definition is a study of programming. Whether the mathematics explored by mainstream mathematics is the same mathematics explored by the code monkey is perhaps relevant. But the duality exists. In essence a study of physical reality is the study of those mathematical objects which can be constructed by the processes extant in that reality. So analysis of anything is mathematics, it just may not be the kind of mathematics we usually associate with the word.",1389276980

Bell&#x27;s theorem is not an &quot;old thing&quot;. I mean, what serious scientist argue something like that... (Yep, that&#x27;s a No true Scotsman ;-) ) I&#x27;ve never encountered any argument in that direction. Of course some people argue against some of the derivations of Bell&#x27;s theorem, and his test, but against the soundness of the theorem in itself ? For the record : &quot;No physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.&quot;<p>Then people who challenge the consequences of Bell&#x27;s Theorem, argue for Non Local Hidden Variables (<a href""http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9906036v1.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9906036v1.pdf</a>). But frankly, non locality is not at all in the actual consensus of quantum physicists. It would have huge consequences on special relativity.<p>So, again, if you want to argue that Non locality is true, welcome to a completely new world of physics. As of today, no one have any proof that non-locality is real. The scientific consensus is that No communication theorem is a much more credible solution to the EPR paradox. I mean of course some people say that proof of NCT are circular. But most only do because they think we can find a better proof of it.<p>How many serious scientists work on disproving the Non Communication Theorem ? John Cramer ? Some people in his lab ? That&#x27;s mostly it. And as of today... they found nothing I am aware of.<p>And then what are your references ? A nature article, published in the vulgarization part of the review and non peer reviewed ?

There is a second possible exploit that is not so well known, which is that a >50% pool can capture <i>all</i> mining rewards. They can do so by never accepting a block mined by somebody else, and instead always mining on their private chain. This pool-specific chain will always ultimately become longer.<p>The loss of confidence associated with such an attack is probably smaller.

An <i>emergent behavior of the protocol</i> is that it trusts people with large amounts of hash power over given periods of time.  Why not trust every client equally?  Because Satoshi believed that IP addresses were really easy to conjure up, and compute farms were really hard to conjure up, so a malicious actor could easily get a majority of the network if you were counting via IP addresses but it would be hard if you required computational proof of work.<p>This is one of the core engineering decisions in Bitcoin.  One of the other ones is, to incentivize people to spend computational power on computations which have no utility the overwhelming majority of the time, periodically they&#x27;re allowed by the protocol to claim bitcoins which are created from nothing.  Every bitcoin in circulation first came into possession by someone who won a lottery with tickets basically bought by the expenditure of hash power.<p>Response to edit: In a war during which 75% of the world&#x27;s datacenters are destroyed, the Internet collapses, Bitcoin dies along with many hundreds of millions of people, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts join Beanie Baby collectors in the long line of people who will not find their favorite hobbies treated well in a nuclear winter.<p>If you&#x27;re answering purely as a math abstraction, though, the protocol will eventually self-correct by picking a new, lower block difficulty, with the goal being creating a new block approximately every ten minutes.  The approximate upper bound on how long it would take to recalibrate if you lost 3/4th of the hashing power is plus or minus eight weeks.  (I originally said &quot;an hour&quot;, which is clearly in error.)  During the interim, Bitcoin would be possible to transact in and mine but it would be slower than previously -- instead of it requiring about an hour to know that a given transaction was safe to rely on, it would require about four hours.<p>But again: Bitcoin is very much not robust against &quot;the end of the world.&quot;",1389276557

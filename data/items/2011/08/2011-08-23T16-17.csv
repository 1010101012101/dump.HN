A reflection based on the idea that the existential framework such a being would operate in would be so diverged from the originating human that the old concerns, wishes and plans would likely pale to utter insignificance. The relationship between a seed and a maple tree.<p>This is not a statement that presumes that the human's wishes were more meaningful or that things should be a certain way. No, its just an abstract observation that the assumption that the new being would share the same core being, values, views and attach the same significance to old memories is baseless.",1314118797

2917327,comment,2913828,2915359,1,0,barkingcat,,,"I'd like to counter that my subjective impression <i>is</i> important when looking at a design.<p>I take one look at the site, and it repulsed me away from taking a look at the site contents further. That's what <i>design</i> does - it can attract you and make you obsess and salivate over it without you knowing why (like the design for the iphone for example), or it can make you look away as soon as you even get a glimpse at it.<p>I can handle different artistic styles - but just do it well. There is a visual hierarchy, but it serves to distract me instead of guiding me along the contents of the page.<p>I may sound really harsh - but that's because I value meaning and content over technical consistency. For example, the diamonds are used in an extremely consistent way - to mark the separation of content - BUT they clash against the white lines which serve a lower purpose - which one grabs your attention more? I don't know, they both look pretty loud.<p>Again, a very technical design - very consistent - but there is no use to having all these elements all over the page.<p>I suggest if they want to use diamonds, then make the white lines thinner. The diamonds mark distinction between pieces of ""content"" (ie different videos), whereas the white lines mark the distinction between title and descriptive text within a single video. I would postulate that the marker between content is more important than the marker between title/descriptive text, so therefore:<p>1) Have one diamond separating the videos<p>2) take the white lines, and make them thinner so they don't compete with the diamond markers.<p>That's what I meant by ""visual hierarchy"" - every visual element should have a priority - that leads you to think and absorb the content in a priority list.<p>And I agree about the video screencaps - what good is a big picture for a videocap if it's just repeating the title in a graphical way next to the title in the next column over? The coding principles of DRY also applies in design.<p>If the graphical element is considered important, then<p>1) keep the screenshot / video player that has the title as the videocap - use the <alt> tag to have the title show up in screenreaders for accessibility if people have browsers that can't display images.<p>2) REMOVE the title from the right hand column<p>3) just have the descriptive text in the right hand column.<p>Propagate this down the entire list of videos and that immediately cleans up the design a lot.<p>The other explanation I can think of is that this is a ""look what I did over the weekend"" project. The whole thing is very tongue and cheek so maybe it has some insider designer jokes - but that means we as hackers should not be parading it around as a good design.",1314118695

2917286,comment,2916636,2916997,1,0,Terretta,,,"You're right, Amazon is overpriced for large file storage and delivery, but the devil is in the details.<p>By way of comparison, we (advection.net) have footprint in US, Europe, and SE Asia, and for large online video streaming clients we routinely charge about 1/3rd of the CDN mentioned in the blog.<p>But I'd venture it's less about price, and more about what you're trying to do.<p>For example, you might want to use AWS for your application hosting, <i>and</i> MaxCDN for your static web assets, <i>and</i> someone like us for streaming video.  Unlike Amazon S3 or even CloudFront, for video you may want someone supporting <i>native streaming protocols</i>[1] including Apple's adaptive HTTP live streaming or Microsoft's SSTP.<p>Keep in mind the brand name CDNs you mention charge extra for everything on top of their bandwidth price. The bandwidth price might seem lower, but if you divide all the ""extras"" (like, say, reporting, tokens, or live URLs) by your usage, it's generally costing you more. Meanwhile, S3's storage might seem lower, but their price is per location and they charge you between S3 and CloudFront, while ours is a single rate with no charge to distribute from hubs to edges.<p>Besides delivering from our footprint, we also handle distributing traffic across other CDNs if you have a very large event or want multi-CDN traffic/cost management.  As volume buyers and with our provisioning tools, we can offer you a blended rate often less than you can get on your own, or you can ""bring your own CDN"" and we'll distribute the traffic according to your specs. (From 2001 to 2008 we were solely private labeling video delivery on behalf of major CDNs that didn't have video delivery capability built yet, so we can provide a lot of help with multi-CDN integration needs, such as multi-CDN rollup logs and reporting.)<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_streaming_media_systems#Protocol_support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_streaming_media_s...</a>",1314118082

That is definitely nice.<p>Elasticache does seem to be sitting in an awkward middle ground between renting of instances and paying for usage in an API.<p>Edit: after thinking about it more and reading some of the comments, I think an ideal setup would be an API to a memcached like datastore with buckets so I can specify max-size, redundancy, expiration methods, etc on a per bucket basis.

If I need a two-column layout on my slide, I just type it in and it works. If I need to reveal parts of the slide step-by-step, I just type in \\pause and it works. Also, I rarely need to adjust the font sizes etc.: the defaults are just sensible, if not outright beautiful. And, also, custom themes and goodies like the progress indicators are great (see the Singapore theme).<p>* I like Impress for the fact that I have a fine grained control over a layout, should I need a something that goes beyond a columns/rows layout. Also, I can import and resize graphics without pain (in LaTeX it takes time). Also, I have more choice of animations, but adding them is very time consuming. Finally, I don't need to rebuild the slides after the tiniest change as with LaTeX.<p>The HTML/SVG/CSS/JS seemed to have a potential to offer the best of both worlds, but the scaling problem (as described above) was throwing me back. In the process I've written down a list of features for my dream presentation tool:<p>* beautiful typography<p>* flexible layout: I should be able to specify the layout declaratively (e.g. two columns and a header, or a header, block of text and a table) with the tool figuring out the rest (font sizes, margins, etc) or fine-tune it manually where I can specify the font sizes and positions of every element<p>* themes and widgets (progress indicators, timers, slide numbers etc)<p>* should be easy to embed pictures and diagrams with scriptable animations (SVG+JS seems to be ideal for it, and I've used Inkscape for a while). The animations should be: rotation, translation, resizing,  showing/hiding, change of color and zooming (the latter one being the only thing that I'm missing in both LaTeX and PowerPoint/Impress).<p>* being able to edit the presentation on the fly.

This often results in you having to wait for a class to be held in your area or you having to pay additional travel costs.  It isn't unusual to pay up to $2,500 in travel costs just to get to the city where your class is being held!  Imagine having to pay a total of $7,000 just to attend a Linux or UNIX class.<p>One Course Source has just announced a solution with a special offer of $995 for their week-long Linux and UNIX classes.  The standard cost of their classes was already a low $1,900.  With this new price, the training is even more affordable.  You can now take three or four One Course Source classes for the cost of just one class with another training vendor!  You can sign up here: http://www.OneCourseSource.com/Discount<p>Choose from a variety of class levels, from beginner to advance.  All classes are conducted by a highly qualified One Course Source instructor.  Their instructors have many years of training experience as well as a great deal of hands on experience.<p>One Course Source's Linux classes are also designed to help individuals become certified.  Students learn the topics they need to know in order to pass Linux certification exams as well as developing skills necessary to utilize Linux in the IT industry.<p>In addition to providing these special rates on their San Diego-based classes, One Course Source has just announced new, online training!  These online classes can be taken from your home or office, anywhere in the world.  The classes are instructor-led, just like the classroom-based classes.  Students world-wide can now take these classes and learn Linux or UNIX without having to travel or incur the additional expense of travel.<p>In addition to the Linux and UNIX classes, One Course Source has also discounted their Perl and BASH classes.  Perl is an excellent language for parsing data from text files while BASH has long been used by system administrators to automate repetitive tasks.  Combining Perl and/or BASH knowledge with Linux and/or UNIX experience will make you more marketable in the IT industry.<p>There is a limited time for these discounted rates from One Course Source.  The discounted rate will no longer be available after September 15, 2011.  Additionally, only five students per class can sign up using this discounted rate.  This means that the sooner you sign up for a class, the better the chance is that you will get this discounted rate.  To sign up for these classes, go to http://www.OneCourseSource.com/Discount",1314116717

An article on vim color themes could define an attribute of ""Background?"" with options ""light, dark, both"".<p>At some point in the future, then, you could filter and look at just the items in the list that match an attribute. E.g., I can look at the coffee shops and filter to look at only the ones that give free wifi.<p>Great work!",1314115693

I have recently started freelancing after my stint as a single founder, and am currently doing part-time contract work remotely for another HN member's startup.<p>I am proficient with Ruby on Rails and generally quite adept at picking up new technologies as per the needs of the product. I call myself a generalist, and if you are a non-technical person, I can handle most of the things for you that go in to building & launching a software product (including screen flows, server-side programming, system administration, analytics & a little bit of digital marketing.)<p>I am open to a potential co-founder role as well, but as you know well, a <i>lot</i> of things need to fall in place for it.

But even so, I don't think that Apple's adding a specific clause to their App guidelines due to the very small percentage of people who are downloaded App Discovery apps and then get confused.<p>If I had to guess at their motivation, it would be their attempt at blocking paid-for-promotion schemes that try to game the App Store ranking systems.

I've managed to have production blow up on me because cascading job failures caused redis to exceed memory.  RAM is pretty tight on EC2 instances.

For now, logging into the same account is ok. However, with Windows 8 tying into the live ID, it would be better if we each had our own separate logins, but had ""family share"" folders, for things like family documents and pictures. You can do that now, but the folders wouldn't sync.<p>Nobody has solved the ""family sync"" problem yet. Give me separate accounts for each member, but have a shared space that everyone accesses, with local sync, and the ability to manage some sort of shared quota system (I don't want to have to pay for 3 accounts x 50GB, would rather pay once for 100GB allocated my own way).

I then discovered extract_url.pl[1], which is much, much better.<p>offlineimap likes to hang randomly - mail just stops coming in and the process never stops, requiring me to remove the lockfile by hand, then kill the process. I haven't found a replacement for it, unfortunately. Definitely open to suggestions on this front.<p>The linked view_attachment.sh file has problems, for example, with files with multiple dots in the filename (among others). I have made a few tweaks[2] to it to make it more robust. It still has a few issues, but I've found it to work better for the most part.<p>msmtp is probably unnecessary nowadays if you have a typical setup. For GMail, add the lines:<p><pre><code>  set smtp_url            = smtp://your@email.com@smtp.gmail.com:587/\n  set smtp_pass           = mah_password\n</code></pre>\nto .muttrc and you should be ready to go.<p>I also wrote a very small, crappy applescript launcher to launch an iTerm with mutt from the OSX dock[3].

Each of the traditional Unix utilities evolved from some earlier tool, and carries with it to this day both the quirks of its predecessors and many artifacts of the design constraints of the time. Some argue that this diminishes usability, and they may have a point. But I find that it gives Unix a certain charming character that I've grown quite fond of. I suspect this sentiment is fairly pervasive, and probably contributes substantially to Unix's resistance to change over time. Maybe it isn't the simplest thing to learn from scratch, but it's robust and highly dependable once you've learned it.",1349113022

But one of the things I never liked about centralised or even federated auth was all the links between accounts.<p>One thing I don't like: ideally, all a site should need to know is that I'm the same entity I claimed to be last time. I only want to be locally unique on the site, not a globally unique value which can be correlated between sites. Also, it should be my choice as to whether I disclose my email address to sites.<p>In practice, email addresses are usually required for signups, and it's easy enough to create throwaways. I can absolutely see why it was designed this way, but it would still be nicer if the protocol did not disclose more than it needed to.<p>In this case, the email address (and equivalently the public key the browser holds for that email address) can be correlated between sites.<p>I thought a bit about making a mailinator-like IDP (i.e. a convenient way to hack around this). Unfortunately, I can't see a good way right now to get both these properties at the same time:<p>a) The IDP doesn't know what site (RP) the user is logging in to\nb) The IDP can auto-generate a persistent unique id for each site (RP) (e.g: <type-4-uuid>@idp...)<p>I guess the degenerate case would be an IDP which signs <anything@idp...>. Not super useful, but OK for sites where you didn't really want to have a login anyway, I guess... true mailinator style, but for logins.<p>A few other points:<p>* Would also be good to have a privacy option to force the browser to generate a fresh keypair every time a new user certificate is requested; at least then we can only be tracked by identity and not so much by device over time as well.<p>* There is the obvious timing attack, where if the RP doesn't cache the IDP's public key, it may disclose what site the user is logging in to, to the IDP.<p>* Also, verifier.persona.org will know who is logging in where, if you use their JS (since you pass the assertion and the audience via REST).<p>* I am not 100% sure at this stage what stops a malicious user from simply asking the browser to perform an identity assertion and grabbing email (or clickjacking the user into doing it) when they already have a user cert; haven't looked at it in depth though.",1349112884

The Ubuntu 12.04 installer does create and install to btrfs but didn't let you configure things like raid level so you were stuck with whatever it did.<p>I've been running all my systems on btrfs for several months now on Ubuntu 12.04 (kernel 3.2) on both SSD and HDD including using RAID 0, RAID 1, dmcrypt/LUKS, inplace conversion from ext4 and who knows what else.  (Across my server, workstation, laptop and HTPC.)<p>The only problem I have had is when filesystems fill up.  I've never lost data but it can be quite frustrating trying to find files to delete (also need to be removed from snapshots), rebalancing etc to get things running smoothly again.  The various ways of doing df are mostly a work of fiction.<p>My data is duplicated to offline backups, Dropbox, multiple systems and git/hg repositories so the failure of any system would be annoying but I'd never lose anything.  You should make sure you are in that position first, independent of what filesystems are being used.",1349112448

Lambdas (as you mentioned) are not only shortened syntax, but also capture the `this` variable automatically for you. Try typing in the following at the playground in the body of the `greet` method to see what I mean (<a href=""http://typescriptlang.org/playground"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typescriptlang.org/playground</a>):<p><pre><code>  var x = a => this.greet();\n</code></pre>\n2. Classes with inheritance are a big one, implemented using the IIFE pattern as well, with support for static and class members.<p>3. Interfaces with duck typing are very lightweight and easy to use:<p><pre><code>  interface IGreeter { greet(); }\n  class Greeter /* implements IGreeter */ {\n      greet() { ... };\n  }\n</code></pre>\n4. Extensive type inference. In the following example, the function greet will be typed () => string:<p><pre><code>  class Greet {\n    greet(x: number) {\n        var s = ' greetings';\n        return x + s;\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nStatic and member vars, return types, local variables, all are type inferred.<p>5. Javascript is TypeScript, just without typing, so converting your codebase is instance, and then you can begin adding type annotations to get more robust checking",1349111361

4598104,comment,4597498,4597904,6,0,kbeegle,,,"Goldman Sachs statement isn't that surprising when you think about it from the perspective of countries and country size. Of the major oil producing countries, the only one larger than the U.S. is Russia (Canada's reserves are mostly natural gas).  In addition to this midwest boom, the U.S. also has large reserves in Alaska and in Gulf Coast and it makes sense to deploy newer more expensive technologies to extract new oil reserves because the consumption is happening so close to the source and a stable political environment makes it worthwhile to make long term investments. Also, the difference is not as big as I first thought it was: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_produc...</a>.<p>On the pricing, I'm speculating a bit but I don't think the refineries issue is that major an issue for gas pricing. If you remember, during Hurricane Katrina, a number of refineries were shut down or damaged and prices did bump up a bit, but not dramatically so. I think the biggest factor is there's a lot more demand for oil on the world market. We typically hear about the growing number of cars in China and India as people's income rises and car costs drop but the same is happening all over the world. This week the BBC had a good article on the 180km traffic jams in Sao Paulo, Brazil. <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19660765"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19660765</a>.<p>Oil is a global commodity and is fairly mobile so a demand increase in one part of the world raises prices everywhere.

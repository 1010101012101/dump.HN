Keeping your body hydrated assists the kidneys in their normal functioning and ensures that toxins acquired through food consumption are rapidly eliminated. At an optimal level of hydration, this occurs naturally; however, most people are at least somewhat dehydrated a large majority of the time. Drinking lots of water prevents this issue.",1283907407

1670670,comment,1669413,1670194,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Perltidy just handles formatting. Scary basement code is often poorly formatted and reformatting is a necessary first step in fixing it, but it's a trivial first step. It doesn't address the hard part.<p>Perlcritic is closer to what you're thinking of; it examines the structure of the code and points out design and implementation problems. It can't fix them for you though, and it only handles common designs that it knows about. It can't judge the quality of a design that it's not already programmed to recognize. Again, a useful tool for fixing all of the common problems, but it can't address the overall design.<p>The refactoring tools in IDEs like Visual Studio are useful too, but they don't understand your code in a way that would help redesign it. They just automate much of the process of extracting code from one method to another method/class. Useful, but not redesigning your code for you.<p>Ultimately, it takes an intelligent software designer to do this kind of work. Maybe artificial intelligence will handle it some day, but that's not coming for a while.",1283907361

1670654,comment,1669413,1670554,0,0,jerf,,,"Times were different back then. The article says the original control dates from 1990, and wikipedia confirms that Windows 3.0 came out in 1990 so it is plausible. The 486 had just been released in the previous year, so it was the New Hotness and not very many people had it, so you'd be looking at an install base of mostly 80386s with a substantial contingent of 80286s that your program still needed to run on with acceptable performance. Wikipedia says for the 80286 you're looking at a top-end of 12MHz, with 6 and 8 MHz in the field. Since this is a Windows 3.0 program, you had a minimum of 640KB on the system (though of course you can't use it all).<p>So this is a program that has to run with reasonable performance on a 12MHz 80286 with 2MB of RAM. Are you <i>sure</i> you wouldn't consider having your UI read and write the disk directly? Separation of concerns is a modern luxury. And remember, you're using compilers from 1990, too. Don't expect great inlining. (Besides, only profligate memory spendthrifts would <i>inline</i> a function.)<p>(Edit, later followup: In fact, ""separation of concerns"" is one of the major sources of the ""bloat"" people complain about when they examine modern OSes. Much of the ""non-bloated-ness"" of earlier generations of OS doesn't come from programmers caring more about their craft, it comes from programmers having to stuff programs into things that can barely hold them and building ""clever things"" that we would today consider monstrosities like UI widgets that read and write directly to the disk. I am unsympathetic to accusations that, say, a modern KDE desktop is ""bloated"".)",1283906700

1670649,comment,1669554,1670529,0,0,stevelosh,,,"I'm not the OP, but I'll give my reasoning for preferring Mercurial: its CLI has commands that each do <i>one thing</i> instead of commands that have options to do anything.<p>For example: `git checkout` can change the contents of files without changing where you are in the DAG, change where you are in the DAG, and even create a new branch.  In Mercurial you'd use three separate commands for these things: `hg revert`, `hg update`, and `hg branch`.<p>The problem with git's approach is this: making every command very flexible through options means that you need to document the interaction of all these options in the man pages. That makes the documentation for each command harder to read, especially when you're in the middle of trying to get something done with a project and just want to do something quickly.<p>For a real example, look at the help for the two SCMs' commands for changing the contents of a file:<p><pre><code>    $ (hg help revert) | wc -l
          47
    $ (git help checkout) | wc -l
         276
</code></pre>
Some might say: ""But `git checkout` can do so much more than `hg revert`!"" That's absolutely true.  However, every time I want to look up how to revert file contents I need to wade through hundreds of irrelevant lines in git's documentation.  When I'm using Mercurial I say ""Well, I know I need to use `hg revert`, let's just look at those 47 lines of help and find out what exactly I need.""<p>When you combine the help for the equivalent Mercurial commands it's <i>still</i> more succinct than git's help, because splitting individual actions into different commands means you don't have to document interactions between options:<p><pre><code>    $ (hg help revert; hg help update; hg help branch) | wc -l
         113
    $ (git help checkout) | wc -l

Say you live in Chicago or New York, here's how I see it breaking down:<p><pre><code>   10k in taxes

   20-25k for monthly rent, bills, and expenses (sure that's not a Lakeshore drive 40th floor apartment, but still nothing shabby). 

   10k for food (I'm being really generous here)
</code></pre>
That's pretty much everything you need to survive, and survive comfortably. So that's still, what, 35k in free spending money? Of course it's not too difficult to spend 35k, but the point is that it's a lot of money for free spending. Some save, some buy nice cars and things, most are usually somewhere in between. I still have a couple years till graduation, but if I'm making 70-75k after graduation, there's no way I'm complaining.<p>Beyond 75k, the happiness it brings definitely varies by person. If I had significantly more than 75k a year, the first thing I would think is ""Now I have some money to do something I really want"". I'm talking about startups, which I think becomes a lot more doable when you have some money to spend on an idea.<p>Also lets not forget the happiness more money can bring. I think the householder pulling 300k a year is going to feel a lot more relieved going home then someone else making 75k. Person 1 could be unemployed tomorrow, and still be okay. But Person 2, if they lose the job, could be in a lot of trouble trying to support kids and pay the mortgage. The stress Person 1 has is significant, and I don't think this study really considers that.",1283904364

If we are going to consider the possibility of major price drops then shouldn't we model the impact on the economy? Would it make even more sense to make sure we aren't too reliant on that income and that we put some money aside for this eventuality?<p>> Unemployment is 5% because of the mining, not despite the mining.<p>I think that this is because the income from mining has allowed additional consumption and that consumption has supported employment.<p>> There's plenty of room for both. Australia can lead the world in minerals, and mineral extraction technology.<p>This sounds a pretty bland to me.

I bet there are <i>substantially</i> more people using outlook today than IBM PCs in the early 80s, or web users in 1998. There are viable alternatives to outlook of course, but I suspect it'll be around for some time. At the time the IBM PC was released there were also plenty of viable alternatives, and I suspect it wasn't so obvious which one would win at the time.",1231239566

421818,story,,,1,3,palish,"Programming Frustration Rants",,"I was originally going to post one specific rant, but to make this thread more constructive, how about we all share some programming frustrations we've run into?  It could be interesting.  Feel free to be as technical, and as inflammatory, as you want.  Use this thread as an outlet for your frustration with other people's technical fumbles.<p>Here's mine.  Apparently you can't use the C file interface (fopen, etc) with large (4GB or greater) files on Windows, because of a bug in the way Microsoft implemented the C standard library ( http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vclanguage/thread/2204ecc0-d2ad-476c-8b20-362948da8c2c/ ). Quoth Microsoft:<p><i>""The problem is caused by an internal check in fopen, which attempts to seek one byte prior of the end of the file, and read the last byte. To do this seek, fopen uses _lseek_nolock, which in turn calls SetFilePointer with a lDistanceToMove = -1, lpDistanceToMoveHigh = NULL and dwMoveMethod = FILE_END. That appears not to work with 64bit file pointers, so I'm inclined to call it a bug in the standard library.""</i><p>The Microsoft rep then pastes the line of code that breaks large file support -- <i>and also shows how it could have been fixed</i>.  In other words, rather than <i>fixing the bug</i>, he shows how the bug <i>could have been fixed</i>.<p>In my opinion, that is bullshit.  The C file interface is <i>designed</i> to work with large files.  That's the point of the ""fpos_t"" type, right?  It's 64 bits wide, at least on Windows.   But because of the bug, the largest file the C standard interface can work with is (4GB - 1) bytes.<p>The C functions ""ftell"" and ""fseek"" use 32-bit file position values, so they can't work with large files.  But so what?  ""fgetpos"" and ""fsetpos"" do the same thing, and they use 64-bit position values.  There's no reason not to implement those functions correctly.<p>This is 2009.  It is an epic fail for any operating system to not properly implement large file support for the standard C file API.  I'm a game developer, so I'm stuck on Windows.  If it weren't for that, I'd have moved on to greener pastures (OS X?) long ago.<p>Oh well, I'll use the CreateFile/SetFilePointer/etc functions on Windows.",1231239445

Quoting Kevin Rose, - '""Things change in the shower in the morning,"" he says.'<p>Business week seems generally shoddy to me. This article seems a classic example - throw some random punditry  together (aim for big, publicly identifiable names though settle for companies with big PR budgets) that's semi-relevant to current news, add some overdramatic narrative, and don't forget the obligatory call for new tax incentives to further advance innovation. It's a big mishmash of junk.<p>Watch out for the auto-starting video that further proves my point.",1231238297

421800,comment,421542,421617,0,0,barbie17,,,"""Hint: consider what would happen in a real economy with hard currency by allowing the price of baby-sitting to fluctuate...""<p>You are confusing two different types of analysis. If you had taken a (more rigorous) macroeconomics course you would have learned that there are two types of analysis: long-run and short-run. In the short-run prices are inflexible due to unions, preexisting contracts, menu costs, etc. In the long-run prices can fluctuate and recessions are impossible (we don't worry about some recession that happened in 120 A.D. for example). Keynesian economics only deals with the short run, and only in the short run can the economy be trapped in a temporary disequilibrium. Even though the economy should eventually recover on its own in the long run it can cause a lot of pain in the process, which is why Keynesian economics advocates government intervention.<p>""I've long had a hobby interest in economics...

421793,comment,420101,420438,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I'll write a longer reply later and put it on my web site.  For now, as a quick response:<p>I started with a filing system.  I've always had trouble knowing whether to file the car insurance under ""Car"" or ""insurance"".  My filing system is now undifferentiated. Every item gets a (mostly) unique number, usually YYYMMDD where the date is vaguely relevant.  Then I put in a file a line for that item, starting with the ID, and then loads of keywords - anything relevant.  Now I can find anything I want quickly by grepping that file.<p>* Update - that file is now on my home wiki so my wife can also put entries on it and search (using F3).<p>* Thought - the keywords turn the single mass into implicit ""files"", each item belonging to as many ""files"" as it has keywords, and each keyword giving a different ""file"".<p>* I do still have a separate filing system for things that have an obvious designation, and are frequently referenced or searched - like CC and bank statements.<p>Then I implemented the 43 folders idea, and put into that things like bills that needed paying, statements to check, etc.<p>Thirdly came the single ""In box"", and everything went into that. From there I try to apply the processing that GTD defines, although I still have some trouble.  But now most things have destinations: Bin, Filing, Folders, ""Other"".<p>""Other"" consists of two places at the moment.  One is ""Projects to Create"" the other is ""Read and File/bin"". The ""Projects to Create"" folder is what I yet need to define and make more rigorous.<p>Next, I have a collection of lists in my PDA: On-line, Off-line, Email, House, Phone, Work, Today.  On these go classic ""To-Do"" style notes.  I don't adhere too rigorously to the ""Next Action"" mantra, but I do keep it in mind, and my work-style is mutating towards it.  Thinking about it is helping, even though I haven't implemented it in its full glory.<p>Finally, ideas, results of on-line browsing, results from work, etc, all get a separate piece of A6 paper (scrap A4 cut into four) and put in the ""In box"", and so the cycle begins again.<p>The hardest part is forcing myself to use the lists as my guide, but the rewards from doing so are reinforcing the action.  I am starting to get things done, and I can see that one or two of my projects are being turned into items on my lists, that become actions that happen, which progress the projects.  My work-flow is mutating towards GTD, although it may settle on something different that suits me better.<p>I ought to write this up, but I've been reluctant to create yet another GTD zealot/derivative page.<p>Comments and questions welcome.",1231236209

Protocols like Openflow, and whatever the contrail version was called, seems o be where network automation is headed. Centralized state &  modelling and pushing specific paths/updates out to the edge.<p>With regards to &quot;bare metal&quot; virtualization I&#x27;d expect to see a lot more in the next 12-18 months. On the network you need dynamic path configuration and traffic encapsulation/isolation. That should be &quot;openflow&quot; and vxlan/nvgre. On the host hardware youll want io virtualization (sr/mr iov) and possibly hardware encap as well. Substantial progress is being made on both fronts.<p>Edit: although its great to have two encap options I think theyre incomplete at best. All of the hard work has been punted to the centralized controllers and the rfcs have nothing useful to contribute there.

8911460,comment,8909954,8909954,0,0,tomlock,,,"This article is full of speculation and really casts an uncritical eye towards the thinly spread facts within.<p>&quot;The huge difference in reproductive success very likely contributed to some personality differences, because different traits pointed the way to success. Women did best by minimizing risks, whereas the successful men were the ones who took chances. Ambition and competitive striving probably mattered more to male success (measured in offspring) than female. Creativity was probably more necessary, to help the individual man stand out in some way.&quot; - pure speculation from Baumeister here and in a lot of this talk<p>The implication of this talk is really clear: that feminists should shut up about the inequalities between men and women, because men have it bad/worse, too.  The thing is, a lot of contemporary feminist thought discusses precisely those issues, and sees the destruction of all baggage surrounding gender as the goal.<p>However, it seems like a lot of contemporary thinkers in the same vein as Baumeister here have missed that boat, and are still stuck with the view that feminism is locked in the pre-simone de beauvoir days where women had to fight to win the vote and own property.  Contemporary feminists generally see the fight for lawful (de jure) equality as a more minor concern when compared with social equality.  Baumeister&#x27;s argument that wealth and success was created in the &quot;men&#x27;s sphere&quot; and women were left behind, is actually more an affirmation of the contemporary feminist struggle against social inequality than anything else.<p>Contemporary feminist thought discusses many of the topics in Baumeister&#x27;s talk.  The rate of rural suicide amongst men is a problem in rural Australia, and is often bought about by same-sex attraction, loneliness, and an inability or unwillingness to seek help due to social isolation.  Contemporary feminism attempts to break down the stigma related to men seeking out help in this way, of the feeling that crying is for women, of the idea that you have to be with a woman to be a success.",1421667969

The reason for this is very simple. You need bitcoins to make arbitrage happen. Bitcoin fluctuates so much that it carries a large currency risk. This is why none of us has more than a few bitcoins on their accounts - we&#x27;re not wealthy or reckless people. In order to exploit arbitrage opportunities ourselves, we&#x27;d have to buy large quantities of bitcoins to arbitrage them and make profit. Some people on the other hand already have large amounts of bitcoins and don&#x27;t have much to do with them except watch the price fluctuate. We offer them a better use of it ;)<p>2. Profit is not made for free - there are risks involved. One simple risk is that one of the bitcoin markets we trade on goes bust. We list all risks on our website.<p>3.) This is true - there are plenty of people arbitraging the market which is why price differences among markets are already minimal. However when you have a large enough volume of users you get lower fees. It also depends on how good the algorithm you use is.

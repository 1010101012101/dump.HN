Given a certain amount of income, a home buyer can afford a certain monthly payment.  If interest rates go up, and prices didn&#x27;t fall, payments would go up.  Since the market can&#x27;t support higher payments -- people are paying as large a fraction of their income as they can stand to already -- what will happen instead is that prices will have to come down.<p>As for the plot, it&#x27;s just a log-log plot.

10903980,comment,10902323,10903202,0,0,belorn,,,"Humans are social animals and have a <i>need</i> for cultural interaction. There is plenty of historical examples where groups has been denied this, like slaves being forbidden to play music, or cults that forbade children to access books, radio and TV, and the negative impact has been studied to a certain degree. I have read about lack of culture being linked with increased violence, less social abilities, lower income later in life, and (obviously) lower creativity in the arts. With that comes social isolation which has direct health impact with increased stress and other really bad symptoms.<p>If a person take it upon themselves to eliminate the disadvantage from being poor by accessing culture illegally, which has no harmful impact to anything or anyone physically, then I don&#x27;t blame them, especially if they are a child. Its not their fault that the incentive model of culture demands that poor people must be denied access in order to force rich people to pay.",1452801367

The people who are going to care about high-quality journalism and not care about the negative connotations of an Arabic ownership are less likely to subscribe to cable, the only place to find Al Jazeera. Conversely, the majority of people who watch cable news tend to be older and more conservative, which is why Fox News has the number one viewership among cable news channels. Most people who watch Fox News will fit into the xenophobic demographic I mentioned above. If you don&#x27;t think the &quot;average American&quot; (in this case &quot;American&quot; is defined as &quot;someone who watches American cable news channels&quot;, not actually the average American) is that closed minded, remember that in 2012, Fox News had 2 million viewers compared to CNN&#x27;s >700,000.

You&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s not healthy, it&#x27;s destroying our nation and the entire world with it.<p>Liberals are going to be pretty happy with NPR. Younger people are going to get their news from social media, not from cable. Conservatives are going to be very happy with Fox News. Older people aren&#x27;t going to want to switch their news channel to something unproven.

I&#x27;ve seen 400 person companies that acted more like 10 person startups and 30 person startups that acted like 400 person companies.  It all varies.<p>Join the company who&#x27;s people, product, and culture make you the most happy, IMHO.

(This is pointed out by the author and its worth rereading that section and really understanding it).<p>2)  Geographic diversification doesn&#x27;t work in real estate because its a physical asset that requires a hands on approach.  Big developers / owners get big by buying locally and being ruthless about only buying things very, very close to where they live until they get so big that they start hiring (40+ units).  Then they stretch out 1-3 miles and they don&#x27;t truly geographically diversify until they get absolutely massive (200+ units).<p>I leave this comment as a warning for those who think its a good idea to buy a rental property in Vegas or whatever.

I was curious why you think that content is heading that way?&quot;<p>Every company I&#x27;ve seen eventually goes this way.  When a corporation becomes large enough, they start answering to special interest groups on the left/right and self-censoring content as to not tarnish the reputation of investors or lose valuable market share.<p>&quot;If anything, I&#x27;d argue that globalizing Netflix combined with stronger control over their own original content enables Netflix to move towards an endgame where lots of niche audiences are served (rather than only mass markets). At CES, Ted Sarandos (VP of Content) mentioned that traditional TV had to hit home runs all the time, while Netflix can score with singles, double, etc. Why would Netflix jeopardize this advantage and hop in the time machine to become an outdated TV company?&quot;<p>I hope you&#x27;re right.  So far, they are copying the cable company strategy: license older content to get the viewers and then eventually create your own content to make more money.  It&#x27;s a pretty good business strategy, if you can pull it off.<p>When the Syfy (I actually hate this name) channel first came out, it was all old episodes of Quantum leap, Star Trek, and lost in space.  They slowly built their own content over the years and now pretty much only have original content.<p>It&#x27;s also tends to happen with monopolies (if this ever happens to Netflix).  Right now, they are taking tons of chances and it&#x27;s hit/miss (which means some fantastic content for customers).<p>When you are on top, your strategy changes to what has worked.  You don&#x27;t want to lose market share, which means taking less chances.  You aren&#x27;t desperately trying to gain market share, you are now holding onto it.  So, we might still see cool content, but it won&#x27;t be as groundbreaking or as often.<p>I feel like this eventually gets watered down enough, and big money/advertisers get involved, and the cycle repeats.<p>I was an avid XM radio fan from the beginning.  Many of the shock-jocks were allowed to say and do pretty much anything.  After the big merger, it&#x27;s now a shell of what it once was (the same strategy as the radio industry.  If you compare the jocks of the 90s and today, it&#x27;s a much different landscape).<p>I absolutely love the explosion of podcasts in the last couple of years.

It does go down once in a while but it comes roaring back in relatively short time. Even when dropping, it rarely goes below 25% protecting most of the principal. This is about the only item that had massive inflation in past 7 years.<p>I think what is happening is real estate is becoming currency just like what gold was used to be. In economics, you can make anything a currency which cannot be manufactured easily and is available in quantity that is very hard to grow. Economists are puzzled why the tons of money poured in to system through QEs isn&#x27;t producing any inflation. I think QEs are indeed producing massive inflation but it all goes in to real estate. Funds like Blackstone eventually ends up with significant chunk of QE money and guess what is their major investment activity these days? The easy &quot;inexpensive&quot; money is the best way to inflate real estate. It&#x27;s a like you eat a lot but only your waist is accumulating all the fat and you wonder why your hands and feet remain so thin. I suspect this trend will continue because people are realizing real estate is more safer currency that can be relied upon as opposed to stocks or anything else. The safety is derived from the fact that, in worst case, it can be rented to generate better than interest returns or physically be used. This assumption can only be violated if interest rates grows a lot beyond rent income and thus in high inflation. However overall economic inflation cannot happen if all the surplus keeps landing in real estate. So it seems like virtuous self locked cycle.",1452799535

These pics/vids go into a shared media grid, which is constantly updated for all attendees.<p>You can tweet out or share a link to the media stream so your friends can experience the excitement remotely. Great if you couldn&#x27;t get tickets to that Taylor Swift concert that sold out minutes ago..you can still watch worthwhile snippets from home as it happens in real time.<p>Attendees can also group chat with all other fans both during and after the event.<p>We have created a new effect we call &quot;lightmoji&quot; (like an emoji but with a swatch of light). When recipients click on a lightmoji, their phone screens become that color. lightmoji are great for showing team spirit (you and your friends can together turn your phone to a team color), locate someone across the venue, or to create your own light show (like xyloband but on your phone).<p>So that&#x27;s the value proposition, as of the v1 release.<p>Any comments on why this is great or what is lacking (and we could do to tweak it) are very much appreciated.<p>--Hursh",1452799181

Some would probably be hired back into the renewables/green sector, but it would probably have the net affect of getting a substantial number of people laid off. No politician wants unemployment to increase in their voter base.<p>If enacted at the federal level, it would increase the price of all forms of energy. The average consumer, who sees the low price of oil as a small silver lining on a large post-recessionary cloud, would be loathe to pay more and would blame the government for trying to take away the one &quot;advantage&quot; they&#x27;ve recently received. No politician wants unhappy voters blaming them for higher gas prices and electricity bills.<p>Not to mention the enormous and protracted legal battle that big oil and coal companies would be sure to wage against a federal carbon tax.<p>The only thing that will get enough of the population concerned about unsustainable carbon emissions is when they see the things closest to them - food, water, housing, clothing - decline in quality or increase in price due <i>clearly and demonstrably</i> to carbon emissions. They need to believe that carbon emissions are the fundamental, undeniable cause of rising sea levels, a decimation of crops or livestock due to strange weather patterns, an increase in natural disasters, etc. Nobody cares about an intangible and &quot;scientifically debatable&quot; issue like global warming due to carbon emission until their house is underwater, especially when pollution is great for the economy in the short term.",1452799100

10903588,comment,10897309,10902944,0,0,steamer25,,,"Agreed. To expound a bit...<p>There is a perspective/philosophy* in which humans under anarchic/natural-law are born with 100% rights. E.g., if you were washed ashore with a number of ship-wreck-mates on an otherwise uninhabited island, there&#x27;d be nothing to stop you from implementing works copyrighted in other lands. Further, there&#x27;d be nothing to stop you from violating the terms of any contract or even murdering anyone--you&#x27;d have unlimited rights.<p>But let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re wiser than that. When we wash ashore, we all agree that it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s best interest to avoid killing each-other. Therefore, we each give up a measure of our unlimited rights and grant them to each-other in the form of governmental &#x27;powers&#x27;--if someone kills one member of our new tribe, the other members will kill (or otherwise deprive the rights of) the one who initiated the aggression.<p>In it&#x27;s ideal form, the government&#x27;s purpose is to maintain the largest possible sphere of individual rights without allowing individuals to infringe upon the rights of others. It can only exist inasmuch as each individual condones and supports it&#x27;s actions. To the degree it becomes imbalanced towards one party or another, the aggrieved parties retain the right to withdraw the powers they&#x27;ve delegated--in extreme cases they may fight the other party&#x27;s government to reclaim their inalienable rights.<p>With this scenario in mind, imagine that you see me building a sand castle on my side of the beach. You like the design so you copy it on your side of the beach. I&#x27;m not flattered by the imitation but you haven&#x27;t really deprived me of any rights either--I&#x27;m still free to do as I wish on my side of the beach. Since I&#x27;m not really harmed, I don&#x27;t have an inalienable right to monopolize the castle&#x27;s design. In fact, if I storm over to your side of the beach and knock your copy down, I&#x27;d be depriving you of the right to make that kind of sand castle should you see fit to do so.<p>Given such a dispute, the tribe (including yourself) might agree to relinquish the right to manipulate sand in particular ways and create a new governmental power. The creation of this power appeases and incentivizes me to continue voluntarily beautifying the beach with fresh and innovative sculptures and promotes continued peaceful cooperation. This a matter of policy, there are no higher laws or anything set in stone about the validity or duration of my claims, etc.<p>* I tend to agree with this philosophy but want to take a more objective tack for the sake of the great-grandparent poster.",1452798568

Coal and gas is down, too, but not nearly as much, and don&#x27;t have a long-term low-cost forecast as strongly as oil does right now.<p>Further, despite the green-energy rhetoric (which I&#x27;m largely supportive and in favour of, despite it being a bit disingenuous sometimes), renewable subsidies are huge, or at least have been as of late.<p>Further we&#x27;re seeing wall street come in with securitisation of renewables, making it a bit easier  for renewable companies to finance everything. At the end of the day, you can&#x27;t be disruptive without capital in a capital-intensive (energy in general, including renewables, have large startup costs) industry. Securitisation allows relatively new entrants like solar city raise financing essentially by factoring 20 years of utility bills, without having to sell out the company.<p>Beyond that, renewables are still tiny and if they weren&#x27;t growing like they do, it&#x27;d be pretty strange tbh.<p>And lastly... they&#x27;re really getting cheap, and at some point there&#x27;s a threshold moment you cross.",1452798262

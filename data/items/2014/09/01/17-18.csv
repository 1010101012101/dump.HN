If everyone woke up tomorrow with the belief that in five years some other city was going to be as big a tech hub as San Francisco, then it would happen. Everyone would rush to set up shop there -- startups, VCs, and the random other bits of necessary infrastructure like cat cafes and brunch places where you can queue for an hour and a half. But instead there&#x27;s no consensus on where the second SF is, so there&#x27;s defocused overflow in all directions -- to Portland, to Austin, to Seattle, to Boston, and so forth.<p>Anyway, if you want to build a nerd city in the middle of nowhere, you&#x27;re somehow going to have to persuade half a million people to move there, and that takes more than some airy-fairy promises about how awesome it&#x27;s going to be.

These are the &quot;facts&quot; to which the Court applies its interpretation of the law. Applying the law to any other facts than these would be unsound.<p>Then there are &quot;facts&quot; which give the Court a broader context in which to place policy arguments. These facts are often not developed in the trial record, but are also not central to the disposition in the first place. When the Court makes a policy argument, potentially relying on &quot;facts&quot; cited by amici, they almost always do so in a way that is ancillary to a rationale based on a more concrete interpretation of the law and precedent. All of the examples cited by the article are ones where a dubious &quot;fact&quot; in an amicus brief is mentioned only to add color to the opinion.<p>The article, while it quotes Scalia, also misses out on a key aspect of his judicial philosophy. If you eschew nebulous policy or empirical arguments, in favor of concrete statutory or legal interpretation, as Scalia tends to do, you are naturally insulated from reliance on dubious &quot;facts&quot; (and let&#x27;s face it, even many assertions appearing in properly sourced and cited &quot;studies&quot; are dubious). It&#x27;s only when you venture out into arguments like &quot;the law should be this because X% of Americans do Y&quot; that you open yourself up to reliance on questionable facts and interpretations.<p>This is particularly true because the lower courts tend to eschew such heavily reliance on policy arguments, and so don&#x27;t develop a record that includes the facts necessary to support them. Thus, the Justices that favor such policy arguments often have no choice but to rely on amici.",1409593324

Canonical digital DSP filters are vastly more efficient than Fourier processing. Analog EQ circuits add significant amounts of distortion which add character to the sound. Some of the better digital EQs try to emulate this.<p>Studio effects, pedals included, do not actually correspond to convolution. Many commercial reverb algorithms use complex time-varying effects that can&#x27;t be modelled with simple convolution. While you can buy convolution reverbs from a variety of sources - and they&#x27;re very popular for certain reverb effects - they&#x27;re a long way from being the whole story.<p>Bottom line is audio engineering is <i>much</i> more complex than you seem to think it is. Numerical techniques, including Fourier and convolution, have been studied since at least the 1950s, and there are good reasons why they&#x27;re not a one-size-fits-all solution for audio effects.<p>The image filter, on the other hand, is a lovely piece of work.

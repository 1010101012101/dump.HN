It is logical that this would hamper the ""global"" spread of disease.<p>This particular theory is saying that the way to do that is to reduce the opposite form of outlier - the sexual conservative.",1275789549

btw, I enjoyed the movie.

All of the major manufacturers have design houses staffed with people who's sole job is to draw neat looking car ideas. Eventually a few float to the top and they make scale models out of clay (or in this day and age on rapid prototype machines). And then those design studies may end up as full sized, half-car (lengthwise) mock-ups made out of clay. If they survive that, they may even get made into a pure, non-functional concept car like we see at trade shows. It the public reception is positive, they turn manufacturing engineers loose on the design and they cut out all the artistic junk that would cause the car to cost 4 times as much to make, and introduce safety devices and such that change the styling.....it might make it to a functional prototype at that point where they show it at next year's auto-show, if reception is still good, it'll probably make it into to production.",1275789488

As a fellow HN'r (Coxymoney), I'd love to get some feedback.  We got it in our heads to build a startup in the homemade brew space.  We left 10 hours into the weekend, went home crashed, and came back into the room stoked.  Only to find out the original ""pitch man"" had fallen not only out of love, but into hate with the idea.  We all immediately did the same, feeling funny that we hadn’t known how we all truly felt about the company.<p>Fast forward to day 2 – we broke out the whiteboard and started making magic happen.  Within an hour, Ninja Button was born.  NinjaButton is a button creation and comparison tool designed to optimize conversion rates.  We provide an easy solution to track the effectiveness of your buttons.  Better buttons mean bigger profits. 
As a community that gives kick ass advice, we thought that you all could certainly provide some good insight into what is missing/needs fixing in the conversion optimization and website button space.  Any thoughts you care to share, we'd love to hear.  In any case,  the highlights for our product are as follows:<p>1) Split Testing
2) Geared toward users with little knowledge of web management
3) Tiered pricing model with a monthly subscription
4) Suggestive and measured advice on a button’s placement, style and text
5) Saving time and cost (sorry IT invoice guy)<p>Well that's it.  We are now rounding out our 34th hour and, with only 20 hours till launch; any input would be pure awesomeness!<p>Please feel free to fire away!",1275789233

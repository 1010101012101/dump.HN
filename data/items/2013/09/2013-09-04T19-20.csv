Knuth even has 5 other volumes of books containing the instructions and source code to reproduce almost every single curve, stroke, and space you see in the books.<p>I think advocating digital publishing is probably good, but not for all things. Books shouldn&#x27;t be treated as source code with continuous deployment. Even one word on one page can massively restructure the rest of the document, making it extremely difficult to coordinate and fix.<p>What I think should be fixed is the dissemination of authentic books at a reasonable price, for especially students who typically don&#x27;t have much money at all.",1378324755

I&#x27;m figuring out what study method works best for me.  Now I was in honors all through public so me saying only now I&#x27;m having to learn how to learn is troubling. For my future children, I do plan on homeschooling with a backup plan of charter schools that encourage self directed learning, we&#x27;ll have to see how that goes.

I don&#x27;t think the many number of such recent cases is a new occurrence. It&#x27;s just that the media is using &#x27;Rape cases&#x27; as their &#x27;News topic for the year&#x27;, making sure they make a big deal out of such cases, which is a good thing.<p>But media concentrating so much on this topic is because people are finally ready to talk about such stuff. I&#x27;ve heard of dozens of rumors of rape that were allegedly subdued over the last few years. I think the Delhi rape incident was the tipping point.<p>I don&#x27;t think rape cases have increased, I think the reporting and public outcry have gone up. India is finally dealing with the most shameful parts of a society whose discussion was until now anti-cultural, any discussion related to sex is anti-cultural. In our movies the most just thing for a rape victim was to get them married to the rapist, that was considered giving the victim a life, go figure that out.<p>Despite all that, I and several other people go by our day mostly care free. There is a sense of security in our social lives. Shit still happens, where doesn&#x27;t it not happen. But this shit is not new, it is not unique to us. Making such lame shallow comment about a culture is insensitive.",1378324640

Nor is it an unallowed good, it&#x27;s completely ridiculous that iOS didn&#x27;t immediately o it! (as whatever the opposite of apple fanboys would have said; hateboys?)<p>Rather, it&#x27;s a feature with some negative repurcussions as well as benefits, some possible tradeoffs.<p>Apple, for better or for worse, these days, esp on iOS, generally chooses not to jump into such features right away. They wait until they can expend the developer time on them to consider all the trade-offs and all the choices and different decisions that could be made in implementing that feature. And then they spend that time, and try to implement the feature in a way that minimizes downsides, maximizes upsides, and minimizes technical debt too.<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean they always get it right. And this strategy itself, even when gotten right, has it&#x27;s own pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s -- there are certainly reasons, especially for hackers, to prefer Android&#x27;s wild west over Apple&#x27;s walled garden.<p>But there are evaluations that are neither &quot;Android was stupid to implement it 5 years ago&quot; nor &quot;Apple was stupid NOT to implement it 5 years ago.&quot;",1378324575

I used to develop in Borland and OWL. I moved apps into MFC and Visual Studio. Now stuff is being moved into Qt. People have switched from native to cloud, and so on.

1. Survive.<p>2. Get ahead. You&#x27;re not old enough (in society&#x27;s eyes) to out maneuver the adults yet. Prepare yourself.<p>3. Develop a love and interest in another foreign culture.<p>High School
1. Take every &quot;legal&quot; chance to get out of normal classes. Do joint-enrollment, AP, and technical classes.<p>2. If you must take &quot;normal&quot; classes, sleep in them, or do tomorrow&#x27;s homework (the rest of the year&#x27;s homework if you can) in class. Test well. Then study more interesting stuff with the extra time you have at night. Remember: Homework is largely graded on completion and is typically the largest part of your grade, so do the easy thing.<p>3. Apply for scholarships like hell. Every dollar you can get now is worth 1,000 times itself in the future.<p>4. Learn a language and culture of a (very) foreign country. Don&#x27;t take Spanish or French. Do German, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, Korean, etc. Learning a language doesn&#x27;t just allow you to interact with others from that country, it gives you perspective on your own situation. This is vital to your education.<p>University
1. Buy the best education you can for the value. An online degree is cheap, but not valuable. An Ivy League degree is expensive, but the value may not add up to the expense. Try Georgia Tech, not MIT. Try University of Washington, not Harvard. Use your own judgement here.<p>2. Don&#x27;t go into debt if you can.<p>3. Do an exchange program. Spend a year in a country you care about. See also: High School #4. Don&#x27;t stay in the &quot;international housing&quot; if you can. Try to stay in the dorms with other normal students.<p>4. While in University, do <i>paid</i> work in the field you are going into. The more recognizable the name of the company you work for, the better. If you&#x27;re doing work at the University, don&#x27;t do retail, food staff, etc. Do technical support, tutoring, or administrative. Not only are these jobs easier and pay more, but they look way better on a future resume.<p>5. Take an advanced finance class and an advanced programming class, even if you have to &quot;sit in&quot; on the class (larger universities don&#x27;t take roll and you can sneak in these classes sometimes). These are the two human systems that make our world work today. If you don&#x27;t get this, you&#x27;re going to get swindled as a professional.<p>6. Join clubs. If they don&#x27;t exist, make your own club. Get on the club&#x27;s officer list. Put it on your resume if it looks good. You&#x27;ll make lifelong friends from these people. You might even start your own business with these people.<p>7. Don&#x27;t really bother with Frats / Sororities / Bars. The real fun and parties are with deep friendships you make and that allow you build a better lifestyle. See #6.<p>8. Go with your gut and fly.",1378324059

We do not want the landing routine to be accidentally triggered in flight. Missing a valid packet is much better than triggering on an invalid packet.

Checksum the packets or, better yet, checksum and encrypt them. That prevents the enemy from taking over your plane.<p>Exactly right. We were already using a checksum in the datalink, and the corrupted packet that caused the crash passed the checksum as valid! During the post analysis of the crash, I discovered that it was using an 8-bit XOR checksum implemented years earlier. 8-bit XOR is ok for detecting single bit errors, but is not good at detecting burst errors -- it does not detect ~12% of highly corrupted packets.

Here&#x27;s a quick summary of what&#x27;s happened so far:<p>The first time I submitted the request for a D-U-N-S number through Apple&#x27;s form, I did not receive a call. After ten days, I called D&B to see what was going on, and they said they didn&#x27;t have a record of the request. So somewhere between Apple and D-U-N-S, the request was lost.<p>I submitted the request again, and I got a call from D&B five days later. They sent the D-U-N-S number after the call, but their email indicated it wouldn&#x27;t be usable for 14 days! I tried it on the Developer Center registration form anyway, but, like they said, it didn&#x27;t work, so I waited.<p>At the end of the two weeks, the Developer Center was down for new enrollment--for another two weeks. Once it was functioning again, I submitted the enrollment request with the D-U-N-S number.<p>Twenty days later, I received an email from Apple telling me that my LLC&#x27;s legal status wasn&#x27;t listed on D&B&#x27;s profile, so I&#x27;d need to work it out with them. Oh, and I&#x27;d need to restart the enrollment process.<p>After contacting D&B, I received conflicting emails from them, one telling me that &quot;my request was complete&quot; and one sent at exactly the same time telling me that the changes would be made within the next week and a half. I sent Apple an email detailing this and asking for the enrollment to be continued where it left off rather than going to the back of the queue--which was twenty days the last time--so we&#x27;ll see if that goes anywhere. I&#x27;ve read some accounts of having a months-long ordeal ahead even from this point in the process.<p>I realize things are probably a bit worse at the moment because of the Developer Center problems, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this process is extremely off-putting and it sours me a bit to development on their platform.",1378322382

There are three commonly used environments: bmatrix, pmatrix, and vmatrix for matrices enclosed by brackets, parenthesis and vertical bars. More types are listed here: <a href=""http://www.sascha-frank.com/Faq/matrices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sascha-frank.com/Faq/matrices.html</a><p>* The inclusion of an aligned equations template is wonderful.<p>* The table template would be better if it followed the style guides suggested here: <a href=""http://tug.org/pracjourn/2007-1/mori/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tug.org/pracjourn/2007-1/mori/</a><p>* Double and triple integrals without bounds can be written as \iint and \iiint respectively. (no need for a series of \! between individual \int).<p>* It would be nice to toggle the collapse/expansion of a menu by clicking it. Presently clicking it allows me to expand and the only way to collapse is to click on another.<p>* Throw \LaTeX\ in there somewhere.

BTW, let&#x27;s say you didn&#x27;t want to put the jars in one jar but didn&#x27;t want a classpath. You can use META-INF/manifest to include those jars automatically as long as they are in a well defined place relative to the host jar.

Personally, I prefer the startup culture, but if you&#x27;re going the BigCo route, here is how I would answer some of your questions.<p>1.  Deadlines are deadlines, whether you are at a startup or BigCo.  At a startup, if you don&#x27;t ship, you could run out of money.  In the corporate world, if you don&#x27;t ship on time, you might lose your bonus, your boss looks bad, and you get a bad annual review.  If a startup is a speedboat, a BigCo is a battleship.  Anticipate this, and pad your estimates.  It may actually take 6 days to change 1 line of code.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t try to win over people as much as I would try to earn a reputation for being reliable.  Being good about estimates makes your boss&#x27;s life very easy, and that will earn you points.  Other than that, keep your head down and try to fly under the radar.  This will get you good reviews and bonuses, but not promotions (which I avoid because it just means becoming management).<p>Not sure if you want to do too much networking, but I would make it a point to find &quot;that guy&quot; who has worked there forever and knows all the secrets (who to avoid, who&#x27;s ass to kiss, etc).<p>Realize that your manager doesn&#x27;t care about you as a person one way or the other.  She is just there to execute one part of a bigger plan.  Make her look good by hitting deadlines and not making an ass of yourself at the company Christmas party.  Don&#x27;t ask stupid questions on conference calls with the CEO and you just might be able to pad your 401k and get a few bonuses to help out along the way.  The goal of this job is to get a notch on your resume to impress the next job (my notch at ClearChannel was building RushLimbaugh.com).",1378321226

In my book, that's a second class citizen.<p>The resizing code for iFrames is broken.  I've talked to Facebook's engineers about it.  They know it.  The reality is that it is nasty, tricky, hacky code that is hard to get right and harder to keep running.  It runs directly into the weakest part of cross-browser javascript wizardry: the DOM and dynamically resizing divs.  Their advice was to avoid it.<p>Look: I built an iframe app.  It was the right thing to do for my business.   But it is in Facebook's interest for fbml to always be a little more functional and at least a little better.",1223038406

Quick summary: NDA is gone, but for the App Store you still can't trust Apple in the sense that you need to trust a ladder before you'd climb it. It's not unreasonable to insist that Apple write down some rules and stick to them regarding accepting applications for the App Store.",1223037542

I'm not really a user of image editing software (Seashore covers most of my needs) so I can't really say this for sure. But I get the impression that GIMP want to do things their way, not the photoshop way. Getting young users using GIMP first gives them a chance to do that.",1223035408

Just trying to understand your antagonism towards me, a stranger who just happens to ALSO be a digg user (something you seem to consider as an inherently inferior sub-species of internet people).<p>Hacker News is not Digg and therein lies its appeal. I love the intelligent comments here and the stories are terrific. So don't think for a second that I'm trying to 'ruin' the community by submitting digg-like content (whatever that is).<p>In any case, its a SOCIAL news site. Let the community sort it out with editorial votes. Wisdom of the crowds, yes?<p>There's no way I'm going to make everyone happy with my submissions. It's impossible. As long as its really interesting to me, doesn't violate TOS, isn't spam and falls within the general topical focus/interest of Hacker News readers, I'm going to make use of my right to contribute to the community.<p>I wish something like this won't happen again. If you want to continue this off-topic discussion and thoroughly exhaust your frustration, feel free to rant at me in private. My email is in my profile. Cheers.",1229403242

399185,comment,399161,399172,0,0,schacon,,,"Yes, that would be the suggested workflow - to use this to easily cherry-pick patches into an integration branch that you want and ignore the ones that don't look ready yet.  Then pull that one branch down locally and merge it into your master once it's tested.  It automatically adds the 'Signed-Off-By' sig and everything.<p>Good catch on the bug, I'll get that fixed.",1229402591

399175,comment,398538,398900,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"I see something very special--the cost of starting a software business and the opportunity for getting it to profitability have become easier and more profitable for small teams of engineers. It's special because not all technical fields share these characteristics and it's special because it's newly prominent in web software.<p>I think it's fair, if we're measuring success in terms of money, to measure the success of a business by how big it gets. However, it seems completely wrong to then measure the success of individual engineers by the size of their business. Instead, you should measure their individual financial outcome.<p>The question that matters here is which approach maximizes the financial outcome for a programmer. Did the Trott's do the right thing for their family by taking funding for Six Apart, or could they have done more for themselves keeping it private? What about programmers that have a product idea that doesn't qualify for funding or wouldn't make good founders for a company with a traditional mix of talents? Would they do better joining such a company? Or building a company that plays to their strengths.<p>FWIW, my calculus on engineer-centric small business was around happiness and maximizing the time I spent building software that mattered to me.",1229400838

Maybe this will help transition my way of thinking to ""the Git way"".<p>What sort of workflow do you suggest for testing out a set of changes before applying them to your main repository?

Computationally intensive business logic should be implemented as a C/C++ extension in any case because PHP is still essentially a web language and a glue language.

  # rails try

Learning and being influenced by other's great ideas is how all languages and communities make progress. This is why Scala is such an incredible language to experience.

782795,comment,781315,782353,0,0,warfangle,,,"Sorry, I should have made the disclaimer that I'm basing that on my experiences growing up in central North Carolina. I've been an east coaster for life, though I have family out there on the left coast now. Back home, azaleas and tall evergreen shrubs could provide plenty of privacy between houses. The woods were typically pine, with hardwoods coming in below that, and holly, azaleas and so forth beneath. We had large ""natural areas"" (by which I mean my dad had planted bushes and such, and just let them grow wild) which didn't look that messy, and were absolutely gorgeous when the azaleas were in bloom.<p>I guess if you're living out in the desert you've got to worry about not having enough ground cover. But then again, you chose to live in the desert ;)<p>Funny, almost none of the houses built in my father's neighborhood circa '92 have windows on the side. And they have fairly large yards.<p>Really? You're basing the ""majority of parks"" on some small observations about cali? Have you ever driven through georgia, alabama, ohio, north/south carolina, florida, etc?<p>California is not representative of the US - especially ""middle america.""",1251137054

Are we talking about something like Chrome OS, which looks like it will be an OS whose primary (edit: or even sole?) purpose is to run a browser?

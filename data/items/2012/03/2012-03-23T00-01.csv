3742970,comment,3742061,3742769,2,0,padwiki,,,"I was hoping this comment would come up, actually. The real difference in just in time vs. just in case has to do with delivery, sequencing and retention. A broad, solid foundation sounds great on paper, but there are some hard realities that sink in shortly after graduating. First, within about 6 months the amount of actual knowledge you retain from this foundation is probably going to be between 5 and 7%. That's 5-7% of the total from a not very efficient 4 or 5 years of dedicated study. How not efficient? Well, if you look at the in major portion of your degree, you probably had about 450 hours in real classroom instruction, or a little under 2 hours a week. So, of those 450 hours, you will probably retain less than 30 or 40 hours worth of real useful knowledge. you may dismiss this as hyperbole, but trust me, all that work dissolves incredibly quickly. I remember Big O, a couple of formulas, and the ability to order a sandwich (or was it a donut) in German.<p>More importantly, though, is the fact that since you only have 40 or so classroom hours in any class, and you have to teach to the average, it is extremely difficult to build up to a properly high level of skill in any particular subject. It <i>feels</i> hard while you are doing it, but after you graduate, you realize the people who have been focusing on the subject for a couple years are light years ahead of you. It's even more difficult to chain subject together to reach that high level. The closest thing we have is a generic 100,200,300 level system with some prerequisites.<p>How does this relate to just in time vs just in case? Even if you assume an identical breadth of knowledge, being able to sequence classes together in series instead of having semester and scheduling gaps means you go into the next class with more knowledge retained from the previous, which means you can build on your foundation in a more logical and efficient way and reach those higher levels that you just can't in a fragmented system. You can approach this from the ground up (building on higher and higher concepts), but the very nature of a JIT system means you can also approach it from the top down. That is, you can define the ends result or top level class, and then sequence each course to build up the fundamentals you need, just before you need them.<p>The point? If you are defining a broad base of skills, JIT allows you to master each one quicker and sequence them together to reach higher levels of mastery. If you need skills in the real world, JIT is the quickest and most efficient way to build those skills. The reason I consider disagreeing to be dangerously wrong, is that JIT is so much more effective at real education that those who bank on JIC for their future (students, schools, or countries) will find themselves left in the dustbin of history.",1332464120

That actually seems backwards to me. A controversial story (that is, one that triggers a lot of votes both negative and   positive) would do just fine so long as it continues to receive more upvotes than downvotes.<p>That's not to say that downvotes don't put a damper on things -- if a story gets 80% upvotes and 20% downvotes it will get 75% the score it would without downvotes, which on a log scale is 87.5% as high a ranking.<p>But the point is that things are still roughly linear -- you only need to stay positive (> 50% upvotes) to accrue score, and you will do so linearly. Maybe I am underestimating how competitive scores are, and how important upvote rate is. Maybe a small linear damper on upvote rate has a large effect relative to other content?

3742895,comment,3742368,3742780,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Step 1: Set up a company.
Step 2: Sell equity in that company.<p>Boom, you've just broken the law. Right now the number of intermediate steps between 1 and 2 are ENORMOUS. It's very, very difficult to do #2. The regulatory burden is significant and the limitations on who can invest and how much are also significant. Even something as simple as, say, trading 1% of your company to a friend in exchange for $100 is illegal. Your friend isn't a qualified investor, for example, and your company likely isn't set up  properly to be traded.<p>That's why we have the standard investment track that we do today. There are co-founders and employees (who can have equity) and there are angel investors and VCs. But there's not your friends and family, there's not interested individuals on the other side of the country, because those people don't meet the requirements to be ""qualified"" investors. Essentially, the system has been set up so that at the level below a publicly traded company investors have to prove that they aren't going to go broke by investing, they have to be rich enough so that the risk of losing investments won't risk putting them in the poor house. That's why angel investors are all rich. There's no such thing as a working class angel investor who just barely manages to take home mid 5-figure incomes per year.<p>But with this law that's changing. You will be able to set up a company, with some hassle but not nearly as much as before, that will be able to take $100 from your friend in exchange for 1% ownership.<p>Think about the implications of that. A site like kickstarter is very much dependent on pre-orders being a big part of the ""donation"" / investment aspect. But what if you could not just donate or put in pre-orders for projects on kickstarter but merely help finance them in exchange for a piece of the action? Think about all of the projects on kickstarter that you think are a really good idea and seem likely to be successful but that you don't actually want anything from. Or think about projects you would like to support and think would be hugely successful and you do want whatever they're making but you can't justify a higher level of support because the return doesn't seem worth it. Or think about projects that could potentially earn revenue but that can't easily do pre-orders. As a really ""out there"" example, let's say I had a new way to build giant dump trucks for mining. Pre-orders don't make sense because only a few mines are going to buy the things, but showing people that I know the business and proving I have a good idea and soliciting funding in exchange for equity and profit sharing might still be worthwhile.",1332463117

My list includes two Cronenberg movies as well! Though, to be honest, I'm not really a fan of either. Heh, I know this is a little off topic but for those that dove this deep into the thread, maybe you would like to expand your weird movie viewing experience.<p>01. Eraserhead-- This feature film was the debut for Writer/Director David Lynch. The film is noted for its usage of sound as a theatrical device and ""the baby"" which is rumored to be created from an embalmed cow fetus. The films script is a scant 21 pages despite a running time of 85 minutes (script pages typically match runtimes).<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486/</a>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserhead"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserhead</a><p>02. Dead Leaves--  Produced in 2004, this Japanese animated film clocks in at 55 minutes long. The films (thin) plot is composed almost entirely of a chase/fight scene that begins on earth and ends on a space station. The movie's weirdness climaxes when when the mutant baby of the the film's protagonists is born and proceeds to kill a giant space catepillar which is attempting to eat the earth.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Leaves"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Leaves</a>
<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439533/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439533/</a><p>03. House -- This 1977 Japanese film certainly ranks as one of the weirdest (if not the weirdest) movies of all time. It was unreleased in the U.S. until after a screening at the 2009 New York Asian Film Festival. In an iconic scene, a Japanese girl is consumed by piano monster as a green eyed catch watches.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(1977_film)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(1977_film)</a><p>04. Jacob's Ladder- Fans of the game Silent Hill should well be aware of this movie from 1990 that inspired many of its elements. Tim Robbins stars as a vietnam war vet suffering from demonic images increasingly polluting his fragile reality. One paticularly gruesome scene includes Robbins being wheeled through a bloody hospital corrirodor filled with limbs and mutating torsos.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobs_Ladder_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobs_Ladder_(film)</a>

This 1991 film adaptation of a William S. Burroughs novel features a protagonist who uses bug spray as a chemical escape from reality.

Videodrome-  David Cronenberg wrote and directed this movie staring James Woods. The movie centers around Wood's character, a sleazy TV exec, who inreasingly loses touch with reality after he comes across a station which airs extreme violence and torture. Key scenes include his merger with a TV set and a VHS tape being thrust into his stomach.<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086541/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086541/</a>

Donnie Darko (Jake and Maggie Gyllenhall sp?)- Donnie Darko served as philosophical fodder for a whole generation of ""Emos"". Written and directed by Richard Kelly. The movie stars this brother-sister hollywood team. The movie covers a wealth of ideas including fatalism and time travel.

I'd like to think that if there was any other member of my team that was consistently getting stuck making tea and taking notes, I'd do the same for him. Indeed, I have done that in the past.<p>It's true that people, observing just this one incident in isolation, might conclude that I was ""treating her differently"" because she was female. I can't help that. I, too, am stuck in the society we have, the one where people make assumptions like you have just made, and as you point out it's not productive to <i>tell</i> people not to assume such things, no more than if I asked them not to think of an elephant. If anyone <i>asks</i> why I ""treated her differently"" I'll say what I just said: Team members are team members, none of them should be stuck with the boring stuff all the time unless they <i>really enjoy</i> making tea.<p>Meanwhile, I used the rather clumsy phrase ""as a man"" not because I enjoy writing clumsily, nor as some sort of political statement, but just to get the mental picture clear: I'm a guy, who looks like a nerdy guy, and when I make tea I look like a nerdy guy making tea. I suppose I could have left that ambiguous, as I usually do online - hey, on the internet nobody needs to know that you're really a beagle who can cite SICP and make tea - but in a conversation that's essentially <i>about</i> the optics of an in-person social interaction I felt it was kind of important that we all try to envision an actual room, with an actual team, one member of which is a middle-aged guy who is stepping out to make some tea.",1332461610

Curtis tries to brush away criticism with his claim that the ""kudos"" number is ""an otherwise meaningless number,"" but this argument is fatally flawed. Plenty of things that human beings use for social signaling are, when removed from context, technically ""meaningless"", but within context they can hold plenty of meaning. In the case of Curtis's website, the ""Kudos"" counter is implied to display a count of voluntary approval. By essentially tricking users into incrementing the count, Curtis violates this expectation, which is why everyone feels ""cheated"" by it. Subsequent visitors to the site who don't realize the counter has been gamed may take it as an indicator of how many people enjoyed the article, when in fact the numbers are inflated by other users against their will. This is not only terrible UX, but bordering on outright deceit.<p>In a world dominated by social media and ubiquitous ""Like"" counters, for someone to brush off a Kudos count as ""an otherwise meaningless number"" is either an incredible display of naivety or straight-up bullshit.",1332461183

That since I'm ""obviously a smart guy"" that I should find work at some place based on <i>your</i> criteria (one supposes that criteria would be ""make enough to pay taxes, you schmuck"") instead of having the freedom to negotiate a contract and situation that is more productive to me and society in the long run? So my obligation on taxes is greater than my obligation both to my family (to find the best job possible and to support them during times of non-work) and to myself? (to have the freedom to spend money I have in the bank in a priority that I set, even if it means risking higher debt and fines later on)<p>Nobody is skipping taxes. Nobody is advocating not paying taxes. I've yet to have not pay -- eventually. I'm simply describing how easy it is if you are a non-standard wage earner (like a startup entrepreneur) to get hosed up in tax liabilities. People don't fit into the little boxes that tax policy wonks want them to. That's the point.<p>I grew up with the idea that the people owned the government, not the other way around. It seems that your feeling is that taxes are such an obligation that they should come ahead of personal preferences for work. That folks should take jobs wherever they can find them in order to fulfill their tax obligations.<p>Ok yes, I've rehashed what I think you're saying and it's true: you sound like a dick.<p>Care to rethink any of that?

568475,comment,568259,568457,0,0,rufo,,,"There's actually a very significant difference - a symlink just resolves to a fixed path, whereas an alias <i>always</i> resolves to the same file/folder, no matter where it is moved within the filesystem. They remember things like which volume a file is on as well, so if you were to have an alias on a file server or a disconnected drive it would automatically remount the server or ask you to connect the missing volume. (EDIT: Or at least, used to in pre-OS X times. Just tried it now with an external hard drive and it failed to ask for the volume back. Still works with file servers, though.)<p>That alias also points to the same file no matter which Mac it is moved to, so if you create an alias to a folder on a server, you can copy that to 10 different Macs and it will always resolve so long as it can contact the file server.<p>Since they act so differently, you really can't replace one with the other without breaking expected behavior.",1240072816

They already have one. And they don't want to switch from one Java job to another, unless they are dissatisfied with other aspects of their job. But a fraction of them would easily consider another job if it involved Scheme, Lisp or Erlang programming (or other non-mainstream languages like OCaml, Prolog, Haskell, etc.).<p>So I claim that it is easier to recruit Scheme, Lisp, or Erlang programmers, even in Montreal, than Java/C# programmers. Given that you use the right channels (Standout Jobs, or by advertising on group specific mailing lists/blogs). These languages are not only secret weapons for implementing new applications, but they are also secret weapons for finding new employees. I strongly advise new startups to consider these languages if they want to have an edge when looking for new employees. In Montreal, I am convinced that there is now a critical mass of Scheme/Lisp/Erlang developers to mitigate all the risks usually associated with the use of non-mainstream languages.""",1201189898

What a tool this writer is.<p>Recessions can suck, but -- as another replier said -- it's not an opportunity for ""what's the matter with kids these days"" jealousy. I started my career in 1989 and it took me over a year to land a job. In 1991 I had to quit because of a family emergency, and didn't work again until 1993. The recession played a large part in that. But I don't begrudge those who <i>haven't</i> had harder times for a second. Envious? Sure. But good for them. Seriously.<p>Oh, besides: we're not in a recession yet, and 60% of the reason we'll end up in one is because the entire world is now repeating ""we're in a recession"" as if it's some kind of robotic mantra. If you believe it, you will make it come.<p>I often think that recessions are more the result of Catholic guilt (Protestant guilt? Jewish guilt?) than real economics. Read articles in the WSJ and the writers will actually say things like ""oh, it's about time, we really deserve this, things have been to good for too long"" as if God Himself is going to render judgement. We've stayed up too late, and now Daddy is going to punish us. I beg these people: go to therapy (while you can still afford it) and leave your childhood problems out of this.<p></rant> <blush>",1201188595

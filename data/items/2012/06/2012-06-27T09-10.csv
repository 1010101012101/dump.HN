I work on a lot of small scripts that don't even get commited (and are very likely forgotten).<p>I personally had horrible experience with the previous version (nothing worked) and still waiting to finish hg clone of stuff (and migration of a small package). <i>SIGH</i> I think I'll give a go for the next version.<p>That said the idea is absolutely incredible, but a little leaner first-steps would be awesome.

Nukes in the hands of Israel are less worrying to many than nuclear technology (that could be translated to nuclear weaponry) in the hands of a theocracy.<p>Additionally, the Palestinian refugees of 1947 have all lived in other countries for 3 generations now. Having the ""refugee"" status persist through the generations is without precedent. The UN has a special body for refugees, and another special body for <i>Palestinian</i> refugees whose interest is perpetuating the problem rather than solving it. If the countries the descendants of Palestinian refugees gave them basic rights and assimilated them, the problem would be solved. If Israel allowed the descendants to enter (""Return"" is really an inaccurate word choice given that most of them were never in Israel) it would destroy it.",1340790958

Obviously a lot of people find this post interesting (at 6th position on the front page with 87pts right now). Furthermore, a lot of people tend to find the ""does this even matter"" posts that show up on almost every single comment thread boring and irrelevant.<p>If you don't like an article or don't find it interesting just ignore it, that's the whole point of the voting system. Things that are interesting to a lot of people bubble up, things that aren't, don't. Commenting with ""I don't think this is interesting"" isn't helpful.<p>As for your actual post, the author is saying the rejection letters had a particular impact on him even though he eventually got what he wanted. Having been rejected by a few places when applying for graduate studies after having decided that I didn't want to go anyway(because I had decided against pursuing further studies and starting to work) I can definitely sympathize with the author, it still feels bad.<p>Furthermore, I think the collection of such letters is definitely interesting. Most people when they get rejected tend to think that their case is unique and think that this reflects badly on themselves. I think that it's interesting to see that even people who ""made it""(got his dream job, didn't he?) still went through that. So it's perfectly normal.",1340790190

Companies are capitalist entities and understand fully how value works in a capitalist system but trick workers into accepting some kind of Marxist ""from him according to his ability, to him according to his need"" idea of salary value.  Go tell BMW you only want to pay 40% of the sticker price because you only plan on driving in Nowhere, AR.<p>The only reason salaries would be depressed in backwoods places would be if the cost of living was drawing in so many workers that it drove salaries down.  So is that the case?  If you live in some low cost of living midwest spot in the road, do you get a thousand CVs before you finish writing a job description?  If not, if you have <i>trouble</i> hiring in these areas then <i>the salaries are too low</i>.<p>Nearly everyone in the US is a firm believer in capitalism but they don't generally practice it with their most valuable resource: their time.",1340789907

But at my institute we have many international postdocs. As far as I see it, there is NO way to get a faculty position without an international research record. Some of our postdocs get a professorship though, but it may be in Korea or China, never in Europe or in the United States so far.<p>When I thought about my career during my PhD time, I felt like it was a one way ticket to think about science positions only. They were very rare and the competition is hard. What is to gain except a mediocre salary for a lifetime? At least in Europe it is also tough to go back from a research institute and work for a business again.<p>So I decided to develop software (I am a physicist). That is closer to my interests than science. I finally landed in space projects and write scientific software, have free access to great data (that no scientist in the world can see so early) and I can really focus on my work. The professors, on the other hand, spend their day giving and preparing lectures, organizing money for the research and don't have time to do some research themselves.<p>There are always ways to go.

The correct analogy is:<p>Before HFT, to execute a block trade, your only option was to go to a specialised liquidity provider a.k.a your friendly local investment bank - the CC company in your analogy - , who would take a huge spread - the 3%-5% drain on the economy that you mentioned - in exchange for taking that liquidity risk.<p>Now, with HFT, the increased speed of markets has democratised liquidity provision.  There is a corresponding larger supply of liquidity in the markets, and so spreads have come down - very significantly.<p>The aggregate affect - it is now cheaper to trade on stock exchanges. What does this mean?  When your 401(k), pension fund, mutual fund, etc. rebalances, it doesn't lose 3% of your money to an investment bank.  It loses ~0.01%-0.05% (1-5bp) of your money as a transaction cost (earned by HFT firms as compensation for taking on the liquidity risk), and thus you keep more of your money.<p>It's easy to say that HFT's provide 'no benefit to anyone but themselves' without any understanding of the historical context, but once you do, it's hard to see it in such black and white terms.<p>Full disclosure - I was an algo trader in a previous life.",1340788012

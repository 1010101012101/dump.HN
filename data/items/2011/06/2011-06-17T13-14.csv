2665501,comment,2664881,2665021,1,0,gregwebs,,,"I added a more detailed explanation, I hope it makes sense:<p>In a database with a schema, if you saved a string to an integer field, the database could either complain or coerce the string to a integer. Either way, whenever you read a row, you know what type the value will be whenever you read data a row from the database. Another issue with schemaless is simply mis-typing the key (column) name. If you have a field called referrer, but you perform a query using referer, MongoDB wont know you have done anything wrong. In a SQL database you will get an error on insert and on querying. An ORM can instead be the one to tell you about the error.",1308319165

You are not a cop so they will never be ""on your side"".  They have cases they are pressured to close, so anyone coming in volunteering information is also showing that they <i>know</i>.<p>If you make a profile of a perpetrator of a given crime what traits will he have?  First of all he/she will know all the details of what happened (since they did it).  Someone who wasn't there and wasn't involved wont.  So if you witness a crime and describe it to the police you've just proven that you fit that part of the profile.  That would automatically make you the number one lead if they have nothing better.<p>And who knows?  When I was a kid I did something I shouldn't have.  When I saw a teacher was about to discover it I quickly ""informed him"" of what some bad child had done.  I thought this would divert suspicion away from myself.  That person going to the police and being ""helpful"" may <i>actually be</i> trying to divert attention from themselves, try to figure out how much the cops have figured out, etc.  The cops can't know so the only logical thing to do is peruse the different leads according to which one is closest to the likely suspect.<p>And I'm not even describing the cops doing anything bad like framing people (which isn't unheard of).",1308318458

They wanted to know if I saw anything. I hadn't, but volunteered that I had on my refrigerator the names and phone numbers of the rest of the neighborhood, and seeing that list might save them some legwork. I invited them into the house to get the list.<p>Once I got into the house with them, I remembered that I had just been target shooting with a friend the previous afternoon, and I had a bunch of spent shotgun shells still sitting on the table (if you don't know, the shot in a shotgun shell of the appropriate size, are BBs). Now I realize that I've actually invited them to look at circumstantial evidence that might implicate me.<p>Luckily, they didn't notice, or didn't put the pieces together, so they didn't even question me about it.

2665353,story,,,3,2,IvarTJ,"Ask HN: Your simpler than I thought epiphanies with computers",,"I have had a few epiphanies when it comes to my understanding of computer systems that encouraged me to explore something that I had previously found intimidating. I am curious as to what other areas I would explore after hearing others epiphanies.<p>An example  the command line. Being part of the point-and-click generation, I became much less intimidated by the command line once I began thinking of the command line as a text-based file manager, and once I knew that most of the commands were actually the filenames of executables placed in the directories named in the PATH environmental variable. Before that I didn't think that the command line dealt primarily with something as familiar as directories and files, and I didn't know that you could start any program from it. I thought that I very likely would FUBAR the computer if I explored it.<p>Another is communication by applications over the Internet. In an argument on IRC about which was the best web browser, someone humourously suggested telnet. That made me curious, so I searched the web and found this[1] web page. It made me realise that most, if not all, connections over a network made by applications are basically two-way streams of <i>linear data</i>  two lines of ones and zeros, and that many of these streams could be read as plain text using something like telnet. After that I began exploring other protocols as well with the aid of this[2] Wikipedia article.<p>[1] Best Viewed with telnet to port 80:

I expected better from the programming community.<p>You don't get good discussion from a commenting system. Github's comments aren't designed for with-each-other discussion, they're designed for at-the-author/audience commenting.<p>HN takes comment quality extremely seriously, and with-each-other discussion is perhaps <i>the</i> main focus.<p>reddit is somewhere in between: most of the users of reddit don't seem to be interested in discussion, but in open-ended polls a la AskReddit, IAMA, DAE, etc. The fact that reddit threads only last for a few hours, and that the volume of comments is so huge that it's hard to expect the people you're aiming your comment at to get anywhere, these both reward commenting rather than discussion; /r/bestof does as well. That said, reddit's topical breadth draws in lots of smart people, who are usually looking to talk about something interesting.<p>The vBulletin/phpBB model of forums doesn't really scale too well (unless you go the SomethingAwful route and impose a fee and lots of super-strict moderation) but it works well with up to around 150 active users. The best forums have the highest SnR on the Internet.<p>4chan-ish anonymity works up to around 5000 before you get chaos, hence the longing for ""old /b/"" and the value in the other boards.",1308315961

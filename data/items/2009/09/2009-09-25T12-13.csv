The only reason I started arguing this point is that it was with some irritation that I saw the suggestion from amichail that the definition of ""Theoretical Computer Science"" excluded theoretical computer scientists.  An alternative name for what SPJ does was even offered, to make it distinct (once again) from ""theoretical computer science"".<p>The original article comments may have been talking about a specific community that happens to be called ""the theoretical computer science community"", hence my point that it is up to members of that community to remember to mentally translate into words that the rest of the universe can understand when talking to people outside their community (which I view as a sub-group of theoretical computer science, for the record).<p>For some reason you picked up the argument which was only directed at amichail's original comments.<p>Basically, the framing of the question should actually have read ""Are people who go to conference X friendly?"" - the actual discussion point was buried in the comments.  The <i>question</i> annoyed me, and amichail's even stronger re-statement of this same viewpoint annoyed me further.<p>And then it just got silly, because now we're arguing about the meanings of words like ""many"" (my word), or ""common"" (your word), when really the use of quantifiers in this is really not necessary.<p>My point was not that there are only a small number of people who use this definition of TCS that I'm complaining about (although I <i>do</i> believe that to be the case) - my point, illustrated with my example about chemistry above, is that it is completely bonkers to use it in this way <i>outside</i> of that community.",1253883264

People make mistakes and make insecure software. Whatever language it is. I fail to see how swapping out js for anything else would solve anything. It's all pretty moot also, since it'd never happen.<p>The JSON attack again, isn't any inherent insecurity in the language, just in the way it is used within browsers.<p>Lets improve browser security rather than focusing on a language which has pretty much nothing to do with security issues. None of the examples you give had anything to do with the core javascript language. They were all about how it is used in the context of browsers.<p>Just to get this straight, one of your arguments is that since some browsers apparently execute the javascript inside css ""url('javascript:..."", the solution is to change javascript for some other language?

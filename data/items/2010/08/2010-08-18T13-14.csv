If a PR person tells a tablet-oriented site that HTC are working on a tablet too, surely this is a regular announcement without any useful or interesting details?<p>At the very least, HTC could have bought a blogger to circulate rumours or pointed a trade magazine to 'expose' an order from a supplier's factory.

However, Apple have shipped, the thing works and it has a reasonable software ecosystem.

I think the ideal thing would actually be to have something that's very close, but physically a separate building.<p>Part of the problem is that, if you're anything like me, computer time isn't all work time.  Sometimes for instance, my 2 year old and I look at videos of animals on youtube or talk to grandma and grandpa on skype, and at 2, she's just beginning to acquire words like 'work', let alone fully understand the implications.",1282136766

If I had to use <i>reasoning</i> - that is, rational thought - then I doubt their claim that people who were subconsciously thinking of their own power would also subconsciously draw the letter so it was easier for them to read.",1282136615

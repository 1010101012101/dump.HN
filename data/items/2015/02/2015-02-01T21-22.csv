8981826,comment,8978184,8979800,0,0,Mz,,,"I am also not a fan of insurance. But then I am not a fan of a lot of things that exist because most people won&#x27;t do what needs to be done to make those things largely irrelevant. I think if you are in a position to arrange to meet the need in question some way other than insurance, it is in your best interest to do so. But my opinions of car insurance are far more favorable than my opinions of, say, health insurance or life insurance.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to pay car insurance, in some states in the U.S. you have the option of putting up a bond as proof that you can pay for the damages if you hit someone else&#x27;s car. The GP is giving a big double birdie to his responsibilities. He says he does freelance work precisely to tell the world to fuck off. So I seriously doubt he is pro-actively arranging to protect other people from his lack of responsibility. He is exactly the kind of person the insurance industry and laws requiring car insurance exist to protect you from.<p>Last, I gave up my car several years ago and gave up my driver&#x27;s license nearly three years ago. If you find car insurance so objectionable, you absolutely can opt out. No one is going to force you to own a car at gunpoint or drive. If you are so committed to saying &quot;fuck you&quot; to insurance, you are more than welcome to do as I do and arrange your life such that you can mostly walk everywhere (or bike or take public transit). And if you aren&#x27;t willing to do that, then I have zero sympathy for your complaints in this regard. Car insurance is completely optional because no one is required to own a car.",1422827930

The reason is that they do not have enough regular, stable income.<p>Their rents are subsidized, but the same subsidy is not available for buying property. Which does make some sense, of course.<p>> Making housing affordable is easy: Subsidize the construction of high density housing<p>No. Generally, in European countries and areas with high demand for housing, subsidizing construction is not necessary, and could be counter-productive. Making land available for construction is enough.<p>In areas of high demand, housing is much more expensive than construction cost, and that is because there is more demand than there is supply. And in areas where there is shortage of housing, supply is limited not by inability to construct, but by unavailability of plots to build.<p>Give me some land, and I can build a house myself.",1422827699

For example comparing ack to grin, which are very similar projects in Perl and Python respectively...at the time, admittedly several years ago, ack was an order of magnitude faster than grin. I also wrote a few log parsers in both Perl and Python (at a time when I was working in a Python shop, so they preferred everything be done in Python). The Perl parsers were <i>much</i> faster than the Python variant, for exactly the same work (again, an order of magnitude difference). Perhaps this is just an example of Perl&#x27;s domain of expertise...processing text is a big part of its origin story, and has always been a big part of what people use it for. Or, perhaps Python has made remarkable performance improvements in those intervening years. I haven&#x27;t worked with Python in that time, so haven&#x27;t followed development.

The timing is certainly right and the causal mechanism seems to be there. The symbolic point would be the cancellation of the Apollo program.<p>One of the most elegant critiques of neoliberalism I&#x27;ve ever heard is but a few words: &quot;the cancellation of the long term&quot;.<p>Markets are great aggregators of localized information, localized in space, social networks, and time.  The downside is that this means they get stuck in local optima and don&#x27;t really use long-term information very well.  They&#x27;re really just massively parallel, distributed hill-climbing algorithms for economic production and allocation.<p>So when you&#x27;re looking to move from one hill to an entirely different hill, you need something less like a combinatorial hill-climber and more like an intelligent agent that enacts coherent long-term plans.  That&#x27;s where the state comes in, and in fact, where it never left, since states enforce the property, debt, and contract laws that keep markets functioning in the first place.<p>The counterpoint is that companies like Google (Google X and the like) or individuals like Thiel and Musk have managed to show that once you get <i>sufficiently</i> rich mega-rich people, who are <i>completely</i> secure in their wealth, <i>they</i> can afford to make long-term plans that might temporarily spite the market (like starting Calico instead of buying an Instagram competitor).  The problem is both that the public then has no control over the process, and that there&#x27;s no particular reason for the mega-rich to make these long-term plans other than as personal hobby-horses: these guys are techno-futurist nerds, nobody <i>made them</i> pour their money into radical life extension, space exploration, or artificial intelligence.",1422826744

The original code ran on the Ariane 4 rocket, and there the engineers had proved that the error could never happen with the first 80 seconds of the trajectory of that rocket, which was the period this code ran. The management of the Ariane program decided that the unit was going to be used in Ariane 5 as well, without certifying it for the new rocket. The Ariane 5 rocket is much more powerful, and will get much further in the trajectory than Ariane 4 in that time, so an angle big enough to get overflow will happen. This was never discovered, because the trajectory of the Ariane 5 was never tested with the code.

It is indeed inefficient, but an inefficient financier and generator of invention is superior to none.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been leaning toward the view that &quot;market fundamentalism&quot; is partly responsible for the collapse of deep revolutionary <i>invention</i> after around 1970 or so. The timing is certainly right and the causal mechanism seems to be there. The symbolic point would be the cancellation of the Apollo program. By contrast <i>anti-market</i> fundamentalism is probably why the USSR invented a lot but never followed through on most of it. The ideal is to combine the systems. Fundamentalist dogmas are idiotic.<p>Edit:<p>Governments probably aren&#x27;t that good at invention either. They just look great when compared against nothing.<p>That being said, governments are <i>terrible</i> at every step after fundamental invention. That&#x27;s why Engelbart/SRI had to be followed by PARC and Apple and such, otherwise what they invented would still be a lab curiosity. They just don&#x27;t have the mechanisms or institutional culture to &quot;ship&quot; or innovate.<p>Invention and innovation are not the same thing. Saying they are is arguing that all combinatorial fitness landscapes are smooth and &quot;well behaved,&quot; and if that were the case machine learning would be a lot easier. Examples:<p>Invention: discovery and harnessing of radio waves, an absolutely unprecedented step change in technology. First we had no ability to communicate both wirelessly and invisibly over great distances, and then we did. Inventions are <i>qualitative changes</i> that open vast new regions of the combinatorial space -- they&#x27;re analogous in evolutionary learning theory terms to journeys across physical space to land on a new planet.<p>Innovation: morse code radio -> voice -> high quality / FM voice -> television -> digital -> spread spectrum / TDMA digital -> ... Innovations are <i>quantitative changes</i> that are  more akin to gradient descent in learning theory terms.<p>The evolutionary analogy extends both ways. There are inventions in biology too, like the appearance of photosynthesis or eukaryotic cell structures. These are unlikely events and therefore do not occur very often in the fossil record. Innovation occurs constantly.<p>Biology could invent more if there were a god who intentionally biased the system in ways that facilitated it, but as far as we know no such thing exists. But for cultural evolution -- the evolution of extended phenotype -- we are the gods and can indeed do that.<p>Edit #2:<p>I&#x27;m sure people will cite cases where independents or small academic teams operating on only small amounts of funding have invented world-changing things. Two things about that. One is that it was more common back when science was in its earlier stages -- as science has developed we have kept raising the bar in terms of how much capital is required to keep going. Today the capital and labor requirements to make fundamental inventions are (in most fields) far outside the reach of small funding vehicles or individuals. Second is that this is just plain uncommon. Even back then most of these folks had deep pocketed benefactors or were themselves wealthy. There are always exceptions but you shouldn&#x27;t base policy on exceptions.",1422825856

But, as the prior post mentioned, Rakudo-JVM and Rakuda-Parrot are also getting closer to ready. All of them will likely &quot;ship&quot;, as long as the developers keep working on them, and Perl 6 code will likely run correctly on any of them.<p>Here is the current feature test statuses of the Perl 6 compilers/runtimes: <a href=""http://perl6.org/compilers/features"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perl6.org/compilers/features</a><p>Note that the Rakudo-MoarVM runtime is the closest to feature complete, with Rakudo-JVM close behind.<p>In short, you can expect you&#x27;ll get whichever runtime you install, and if that runtime is ready for production you can expect that Perl 6 will work on that runtime. MoarVM will likely be the first to be ready for production.<p>You may have other reasons for choosing a runtime; if you have a Java/Clojure/Scala shop and wanted a powerful scripting language to integrate into your systems, the JVM runtime might be just the thing. If you wanted the fastest Perl 6 for standalone Perl 6 applications, MoarVM will likely be it (I think, I haven&#x27;t looked at benchmarks, just guessing). The FFI may be easier to work with in MoarVM, if you need C or other compiled external libraries...but maybe not.

For example &quot;=&quot; not being an assignment, and pattern matching in general, starts making a lot of sense.

The laser gyros have firmware that can get funky and the onboard computer would kind of &quot;trust but verify&quot; the laser gyros on the A4.  Obviously the programmers of the laser gyros and the programmers of the nav system are not the same people and had conflicting views on what makes a decent variable type for horizontal velocity.  The A5 doesn&#x27;t technically need to verify the lasers alignment and its of no use after liftoff anyway (so whaddya intend to do if it gets misaligned anyway, land, fix it, and take off again?)  The A4 guys saw that pointlessness of it and stopped monitoring after 40 or so seconds (by then either its working great or you&#x27;ve already crashed...)<p>So the A4 being somewhat anemic never hit the limits of that size int for horiz velocity.  But the A5 which was kind of like the A4 after extensive steroids use was able to max out or roll over the conversion routine.<p>The nav computer wasn&#x27;t very well designed at yet another level and instead of going all RTOS and recovering in a few milliseconds it helpfully kernel panic&#x27;d.  And the kernel panic error message (probably something like &quot;Oh oh&quot; in French) was helpfully interpreted by the engine computer as if it were commands and slammed the engine nozzles over full hard one direction, which the airframe couldn&#x27;t survive (real big rockets can&#x27;t pinwheel in flight, at least not in one piece)<p>So the list of software design failures is epic and huge<p>1) Not every minor math exception NaN should kernel panic and fail the whole system (shouldn&#x27;t have to crash because one temp sensor got unplugged, etc)<p>2) Never do stuff you don&#x27;t have to.  If you don&#x27;t need to align your lasers due to technological advances, then stop doing it, because you can&#x27;t crash the whole system trying to do it if you never try to do it.  Or, if, 50 seconds into flight, you&#x27;re commanded to slam your engine nozzles to 90 degrees perpendicular to flight and you know the hardware can&#x27;t bend that far anyway, I think you can safely assume the nav computer has crashed and ignore it for awhile (maybe the watchdog timer would have eventually saved them?), or rephrased if you&#x27;re commanded to do something that&#x27;ll certainly blow the ship up, unless you&#x27;re a destruct charge, maybe you should ignore it and just keep on chugging along till you hear something saner.<p>3) Most epic system failures are at the border of subsystems.  Like where one machine talks 16 bit ints and the other 64 bit floats.  So minimize your borders.<p>4) Simulation could have saved half a billion bucks.  I&#x27;m actually kinda surprised nobody ever tried this.  I guess test driven development wasn&#x27;t so cool back then.<p>One way to look at the design failure is numerous times they failed when when handling protocol failures.  I&#x27;ve seen this in big bureaucracies time and time again, who cares if the overall mission fails as long as our little group did right by our own code and someone else can be blamed.  The nav guys never should have asked us laser gyro guys our horiz speed if it was over 15 bits signed so its all their fault for asking.  The nav guys never should have asked us engine computer guys to point my engine nozzle sideways thus snapping off the back of the rocket so its all their fault.  The OS guys never should have asked us math coprocessor guys to convert -40000.123 m/s into a 16 bit int so its all their fault.  The math guys should never have thrown a kernel panic on a mere numerical conversion crashing the OS so its all their fault not ours in OS land.  The OS guys should never have run our nav routines on a survivable recoverable non-RTOS system so its all their fault.  Management never let us software devs run a ground test to save money so its all their fault.  The blamestorming could go on for pages.",1422824824

8981655,comment,8979620,8979620,0,0,Animats,,,"Wow. I wrote that article on LtU last night, after going over there to see what the language theorists were saying about Rust.  (And after, for the third time in three weeks, having my Rust code fail to compile because the Rust crowd changed the language again, after the &quot;alpha release&quot; and its claims of stability: <a href=""http://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/12/12/1.0-Timeline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/12/12/1.0-Timeline.html</a>) I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be picked up on Hacker News.<p>Rust is going to be very important. The ownership system is a major step forward in language design.  It&#x27;s a huge improvement over C/C++.<p>It&#x27;s not easier to write than C++.  Rust may feel clunky for people coming from Javascript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.  Having to think about lifetime issues for mere strings is a new cognitive load. The big win with Rust is that most of the errors are caught at compile time.  This is Rust&#x27;s big advantage, but alien to scripting programmers. The Rust compiler report errors in three phases. First you get all the syntax errors, and until the syntax is perfect, that&#x27;s all you get. Then you get all the type errors, and until the type issues are perfect, that&#x27;s all you get. Then you get the ownership errors. Ownership is a global analysis; ownership problems involve at least two points in the program. The compiler produces good, but very wordy error messages. (Hint to Rust developers: put in a line length limit and word wrap for long compile time error messages.)  If your ownership design is faulty, the result is likely to be &quot;fighting with the borrow checker&quot;, because the problem isn&#x27;t local, and just fixing the compiler-reported error will make the problem pop up elsewhere.  The cleverness of the ownership system is impressive, but some programmers are going to feel like they&#x27;re being hammered by it. Successful C++ programmers won&#x27;t have a major problem with this.  It may be tough on the Javascript crowd.<p>Rust requires some advance planning, which may be incompatible with &quot;agile&quot; development.  It&#x27;s also difficult to port code from other languages to Rust without rethinking the ownership and bounds logic. There is a port of Doom to Rust. It has a lot of unsafe code, because Doom&#x27;s internal memory structures are not directly compatible with Rust&#x27;s.  Such problems will recur as big packages with delicate internals are ported over to Rust.<p>This is partly a documentation problem. The current tutorial (<a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/hello-cargo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/hello-cargo.html</a>) is relentlessly upbeat and glosses over too many of the hard problems.

I don&#x27;t have to worry about which indentation level is the right one for the code I&#x27;m writing and the bugs I&#x27;ll create if I get it wrong. I press tab and emacs places it where it must go, if it&#x27;s not already there, which is the case unless I&#x27;m doing copy and paste. At least this is my experience with languages that have block delimiters.",1422824608

Scholars from far-and-wide were invited and given a wage and services so that they could focus on scholastics. The rulers donated the [cost of] books initially but also it seems taxed all ships entering Alexandria; books being retained and copies produced and returned to the original owners.<p>Alexandria was apparently public access, eg <a href=""http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm</a>.<p>It seems pretty close to the modern conception of a public library to me - paid for by the state, directed towards scholarship, open to the public, run for non-fiscal profits.<p>A corporation to me says &#x27;a closed group seeking it&#x27;s own ends&#x27;, whilst these state sponsored institutions were probably primarily for the purposes of the rulers I&#x27;m not sure equating that to corporations is helpful. As part of the Mouseion it seems the library at Alexandria was much closer to a public work than a private enterprise.<p>I&#x27;m not a historian, just someone who&#x27;s read a few articles on this particular [first?] early library (there&#x27;s some good AskHistorian threads on it).",1422824603

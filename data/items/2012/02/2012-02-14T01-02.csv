3588274,comment,3586883,3586883,1,0,ilaksh,,,"To me its about trends as much as anything.  I noticed a few years ago that the kids on reddit were not interested in .NET but were interested in JavaScript etc.<p>So, honestly one of the main reasons I got out of .NET was because it seemed like it wasn't as cool as I thought it was anymore.<p>Another reason, although this is probably a secondary rationalization, is that open source isn't really that big in .NET, and open source seemed important (and cool).<p>Which isn't to say that there aren't lots of rational reasons to get out of Microsoft development, but I just think that we should acknowledge that people don't usually do things for rational reasons.  They mostly do what other people seem to think they should do.<p>Anyway, I don't see anything wrong with drag-and-drop components or intellisense or even compile time checks.  That stuff is really helpful.  I am working on composable drag-and-drop widgets for JavaScript/CoffeeScript web applications.  And I think that less code is better, and if you can accomplish the same thing with a GUI designer, drag and drop and some property editing, then that is better than writing source code to do it.  Its better engineering.<p>IDEs that are slow are not great, of course.  The biggest issues for me are that most everything is closed source and generally the language C# is much more verbose compared to CoffeeScript or JavaScript.  Also your software will only run on Windows desktops and not over the web.",1329184601

3588247,story,,,1,0,jackky,"Track An iPhone With iPhone Monitoring Software",http://omegaspy.com,"We all have our own reason for wanting to track an iPhone. Some of us want to keep an eye on our kids, and to have an easy way to locate them in an emergency.  Others might be in a position where you are an employer and would really like a way to monitor employee phone usage on company issued iPhones or as a convenient way to locate your staff who are remote sales reps. Regardless what your reasons are, iPhone monitoring software is a low cost, but highly effective way to track an iPhone.
WHY TRACK AN IPHONE?
Here are the two most common reasons why someone would buy iPhone spy software to track an iPhone.
	Track Your Children. Parents are always looking for a way to keep an eye on their kids.  Since the iPhone is one of the most sough after phones today, buying an iPhone for your kids and installing iPhone tracking software is convenient way to track your kids so youre able to locate them in an emergency, or if you just want to make sure they are at school, their friends house, etc.
	Track Employees. No longer do employers have to worry about installing bulky and expensive GPS tracking devices on employee issued cars.  Now employers can easily track their employees via iPhone tracking software. This could be to keep track of employees who are constantly out in the field, or for recovering lost or stolen employee owned iPhones.<p>HOW TO TRACK AN IPHONE?
Now that youre familiar with the most common reasons why someone would want to track an iPhone, here is how iPhone spy software works, and how its used to track iPhones.
The way iPhone monitoring software works, is you install the iPhone monitoring app directly on the iPhone you want to track. This is done via a download using the iPhones web browser. You essentially type in the URL of the software (youll get this URL when you purchase the iPhone spy software), and then the app will download directly into the iPhone. Once the download is complete, you then go through the set up and configuration steps.  Once installation is done, the iPhone will automatically start to records GPS locations of the iPhone, in addition to other iPhone activity such as text messages, call logs, photos, emails, and browser history.
As the GPS logs are recorded and sent to your account (this is set up at time of purchase), you can log into your account and youll see a list of GPS locations with date/time stamps.  Now you just click on any location you want more information on, and that specific location will then appear on a map. From here, you can zoom in, zoom out, get driving directions, and more.<p>Website : http://omegaspy.com",1329183879

I've tried doing that work using the included tools on all three platforms. I find the Mac platform the most efficient and trouble-free for that work.

I run a social network in a small niche, and I'm trying to figure out my next steps for this business.  Here's the situation:<p>THE GOOD:<p>* My team and I have been running this site for years and have successfully dominated our domain (more traffic than any other site in this space)<p>* Our business is profitable: we expect about $800K-$1M in revenue this year.<p>* We are bootstrapped and thus have no investor obligations.<p>* Costs can be controlled to under $250K each year--maybe much more.<p>* Only 1 or 2 people is needed to keep the business running.<p>* Finally, our business is VERY stable--unlikely for it to be disrupted in the next several years.<p>THE BAD:<p>* I've been working on the site for many years and I'm not emotionally excited about the business any more.  I'm proud of what we've achieved, but I want to move on to new projects and learn new stuff.<p>* My team doesn't think there is much growth left in our space (both traffic and revenue).  We could start to attack other verticals similar to our space, but I think our team doesn't have the intestinal fortitude to make it happen since we're a little tired of what we're doing.<p>THE CHOICES:<p>Scenario 1: Sell the business - An attractive option if we can get an offer.  Our team can get some liquidity for all our hard work.  With the right parent company, we may be able to more easily grow our business as well into adjacent verticals with a decent bankroll behind our efforts.  However, in this scenario, we may be tied to a retention term of 1-2 years, which keeps us in this domain even longer than desired--this may be okay though at the right price and right company.<p>Scenario 2: Cash cow the business - Since our business is stable, we could stop new development on our site (our biggest cost) and reduce expenses/headcount to a point where the business throws off a lot of cash.  Our business is quite stable and I think that we can go several years with decent profits and decent owner's draws.  However, in a cash cow scenario we still will need to put in some effort--at least on a part-time basis--to maintain the site; that may be tough for us later on if we're emotionally tired of the business.<p>A Scenario we don't want: continuing 'as is' is not an option for the team.

Here we are 8 years later seeing the approval. I attribute much of that delay to a requirement that Westinghouse prove it would never fail. Meeting such a standard has been, for many years, effectively impossible, even for designs with a known history.<p>Thorium reactors don't have any of the 'known' history to rely on and so they have to prove something which cannot be proven without building one. In order to get past that cognitive stall, one has to 'take the risk' of actually building one with the promise that should the risk pan out as being Ok, the reactor will be allowed to continue to exist. It has been politically impossible to do that with a new nuclear technology in the US for some time.<p>Some cynics have suggested that the <i>only</i> reason the NRC licensed it in the US is because China is going to build them and the US wanted a local copy so that they could use as a model should they want to take the Chinese reactors offline ""the hard way."" I don't subscribe to that level of cynicism.<p>So ultimately I believe that Thorium reactors are worth pursuing, however any work beyond theoretical requires a different political climate than the one we've existed in to this point. Fortunately that is changing. I would love to find ways to help people with their emotional response to nuclear power, that will be a necessary part of putting us back on to a path of a sustainable future.",1329181221

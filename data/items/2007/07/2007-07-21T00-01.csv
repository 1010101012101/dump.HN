Imperative programs tend to have a fairly straight and vertical left margin, programs in a functional style usually slope in (for lack of a better description; that's not the actual quote which from memory says ""blocky"" and ""fluid"" instead).",1184979574

35748,comment,35585,35650,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... Email interviews are boring, and worthless ...""</i><p>... but more accurate. It's hard to mis-quote someone in writing (a good reason to use email). Maybe the boring bit your talking about is the lack of <i>physical</i> contact between the interviewer & interviewee giving the writer less chance to interpret and make insights that can lead to writing a more entertaining piece.  <p>From the interviewee standpoint, fact is far more important than spin or fiction. From a reader point of view, facts mixed with entertainment (& possible spin) maybe what they expect. But I ask myself, <i>""what do I want to get when I read about something, I really want to know ""hard information"" about?""</i> - the facts? impressions or entertainment?  <p>I'll settle for the dry facts & any entertainment in the way of humour or language is nice, but secondary.",1184977867

35746,comment,35657,35722,0,0,Jd,,,"I think it would be very interesting to see Pg address some of the criticisms of Arc.  <p>I did notice the comments on the original reddit posting, of which several seemed well considered.  CL seems to generate so many branches that it does not seem worthwhile to study the specifics of each one.  Can anything really be that new?<p>What I would be really interested in is hearing who the next McCarthy might be.  CL is interesting, but wordiness does not seem to be its primary problem.  If Pg disagrees I'd be quite interested to hear his opinion.<p>Perhaps people have other thoughts about the primary shortcomings of Lisp?  ",1184977479

6427110,comment,6426630,6426898,5,0,rlpb,,,"I agree with you. The pain occurs when this breaks down. Take Vagrant, for example. Brilliant tool. Depends on gems that weren&#x27;t distro packaged for years.<p>This made Vagrant unusable for anyone not deploying a ruby-based application stack, unless sysadmins accepted that they were going to have to deal with the extra work associated with multiple vendors and update mechanisms for each language on the system. So those of us using other stacks could use Vagrant, but only if we adopted Ruby&#x27;s app-level packaging system. See <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2059964"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2059964</a> as an example of life being made difficult for distro packagers by the Ruby community. Since Rubyists tend to insist that distro packages are bad, so this is how it tends to stay.<p>Thankfully the packaging of Vagrant and dependencies has now happened (finally; after years), and I can &quot;apt-get install vagrant&quot; now. But I hope this illustrates the problem.<p>In the common use case, there is a dichotomy between distro and app-level dependencies, packaging and development. But in the grand scheme of things we all want to share our work across communities, and this dichotomy is a barrier to this ideal. Dependencies don&#x27;t just go in one direction with language module repositories like pypi and rubygems at the top. Sometimes we want parts of the system to depend on them, too.",1379869067

6427098,comment,6426947,6427078,2,0,mpasternacki,,,"I&#x27;ve seen both; Docker&#x27;s main registry provides some base images (the most used is named `ubuntu` and has base system for Precise and Raring), and I&#x27;ve seen many imaged descending from author&#x27;s own base - it&#x27;s quite easy to prepare a base image using debuild or other distros&#x27; equivalents. Can&#x27;t talk about not debian-ish distributions, but debuild does verify its downloads.<p>The place of trust here is the registry - usually, for convenience, tags are used rather than hashes (and I&#x27;m still quite not sure whether the long hex IDs are hashes, or just unique random names). The registry returns hex id for a given tag, and is trusted to deliver correct files for an ID.<p>I believe that the main index/registry runs over https and provides basic security, but it would be a huge issue if it was compromised. It&#x27;s quite easy to run your own registry, too. What I&#x27;d love to see on top of that is some kind of GPG-based verification of downloaded images (Debian got the problem basically solved in Apt).",1379868845

6427091,comment,6424280,6426376,1,0,mightybyte,,,"> the competitive culture pressures you into continuing<p>This was referring to CrossFit competitive pressure specifically, not general competitive pressure.  I&#x27;ve been involved with CrossFit since 2007 and I&#x27;ve never seen anything close to that level of pressure.  You invoked the legal definition of culpability, and if you can&#x27;t establish that, then my statement &quot;you have no one to blame but yourself&quot; is exactly what you have to come back to.  Even TFA doesn&#x27;t invoke that argument, because that would change the focus to individual trainers rather than CrossFit as an organization.  Are there trainers that would lose a culpability lawsuit?  Mayyyyyybe.  But those are going to be very rare and extreme cases that are impossible for CrossFit HQ to prevent.  \nAlso, that&#x27;s why gyms have you sign waivers.  The waiver informs you in no uncertain terms that this stuff is dangerous.<p>So, we agree that culpability is not the subject here.  That brings us to your new point: that it&#x27;s somehow a problem that CrossFit has a higher rate of rhabdo.  That&#x27;s like saying that surfers are more likely to be the victims of shark attacks.  No duh.  IOTTMCO.  Shark attacks are not healthy things for the body and are to be avoided, yes?  Of course.  Looking life with that view effectively paralyzes you.  Everything is risky, so it&#x27;s not about avoiding risky things.  It&#x27;s about making a tradeoff.<p>> Or is the presented data incorrect?<p>There is no presented data.  TFA was nothing but anecdotes.  Scary, sensationalist anecdotes.  And for every one of those, I&#x27;ve got thousands of overwhelmingly positive anecdotes.  In my case I got stronger and more fit.  My body fat, cholesterol, and blood pressure decreased and I have actual data to prove it.  I also noticed increased quickness, agility, and reaction time in everyday life.<p>So we agree there is a risk.  But I (and many others) believe that the rewards are more than worth the risk.  If you are one of the rare people who has gotten rhabdo while doing CrossFit, then you probably will be less comfortable with that tradeoff.  And that&#x27;s ok too.",1379868631

At most there are 3159 guesses (square root of number of pixels) before you hit one of the factors - and that&#x27;s starting at 1, rather than starting at sane minimum aspect ratio.<p>(It&#x27;s only when you start trying to factor really large numbers that the problem becomes intractable.  For example, the same trick just doesn&#x27;t apply to a composite number that&#x27;s 600 digits long.  We&#x27;re talking 6-9 digits, which a tight loop can crunch through faster than a disk read.)<p>The harder issue is after you do factor it into primes, you still have to combine those primes into a width and height.<p>For example, 640 x 480 is 307200.  Factor that and you get \n2^12 * 3 * 5^2.<p>There&#x27;s obviously quite a few ways to combine those into two groups (two factors)...<p>so you&#x27;re really not done.  Probably the best heuristic is to simply count pixels and then compare with common formats.<p>I suppose you could do your factorization trick, and then try combining the factors in every possible way into two groups, and for any combinations that result in a &quot;sane&quot; aspect ratio, run some kind of vision algorithm to see if there are connected color blobs or something.<p>it does seem to me that for truly arbitrary pixel counts, the factors help but don&#x27;t determine a unique choice.",1379866716

The other Western countries have maybe one each. Apparently, it required not only technical skills, but also a certain culture and discipline of the crew manning the carriers. As such, the Soviets were unable field effective carrier task force and ended up building a submarine fleet instead.<p>With the Soviets gone, that left the US Navy as the undisputed power on the high seas, at least, if you are going by numbers of carrier task force. It&#x27;s the primary offensive power of the US Navy.<p>... and if there is technology that renders it obsolete, it would be a major concern.<p>Note, in my original post, I was not talking just about carriers. I was talking about entire carrier task forces, where escort ships (like the cruisers fielding Aegis) are centered around the single carrier.",1379866167

Your reply amounts to a claim that w3schools outranks the higher quality sites in Google&#x27;s results because it has higher pagerank. Frankly, this is the expected reply. If that is the whole story, it confirms my earlier claim that there is a fundamental flaw in the Pagerank algorithm that conflates popularity with quality. The hypothesis that potential revenue is in fact a signal influencing search rankings is still very much a contender. Not to belabor this, but the protestations of Google employees should not be considered as evidence one way or the other in evaluating whether this hypothesis explains the data.",1379865760

This is not a sound argument, though, since very few of the 5 million students admitted to universities in the US would be competitive applicants at the Ivies. The pool of competitive applicants is much, much smaller.<p>&quot;To address most of the responses below.

9223318,comment,9220442,9222954,0,0,thedufer,,,"Excellent.  Yes, let&#x27;s go there.<p>Over the course of a year, $18 billion were lost to CC fraud.  Meanwhile, CC transactions totaled about $6 trillion [0] (that was 2010, the most recent I could come up with, but it&#x27;s been increasing every year for a long time so I&#x27;ll be generous and use it).  That&#x27;s .3% - clearly affordable on the 2-3% merchants typically pay.<p>Meanwhile, Mt. Gox defrauded users out of about 650,000 bitcoins [1].  This was a single instance of fraud, remember -  I&#x27;m trying to be generous.  Eyeballing this chart [2], I&#x27;m going to give bitcoin a clearly-exaggerated 200,000 BTC in daily transactions, or 73 million BTC in a year.  This comes out to .9%, or about 3 times higher than CC fraud.<p>But remember what I said earlier - CC companies essentially insure you against loss by paying out the fraud themselves and then forcing merchants to raise prices a bit to make up for it.  In bitcoin, a given person can easily lose thousands, tens of thousands, millions of dollars, all at once.  No recompense.  So not only is the rate 3 times higher, the outcome is _way_ worse per dollar lost fraudulently.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-card-data/credit-card-transaction-volume-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-card-data/credit-card-...</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://coinreport.net/99-of-mt-gox-bitcoin-losses-likely-fraud-suspect-police/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coinreport.net/99-of-mt-gox-bitcoin-losses-likely-fr...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume</a>",1426647148

I grab one of their products in its box and I immediately expect a quality product simply because of the box.<p>Even though we&#x27;re told from an early age to never judge a book by its cover, first impressions are hard to shake. And handling packaging is the first impression, not actually using whatever is inside the package. It&#x27;s the first time an end-user actually physically interacts with your company.<p>So I agree with you. If the customer is interacting with it, it&#x27;s a part of the customer experience and should be at least considered. Not everyone can have Apple&#x27;s resources, yes.

Or are you talking about the talented high school students who aren&#x27;t quite &quot;good&quot; enough to get accepted to one of these schools?  If it&#x27;s the latter then it&#x27;s not really fair to only include the number of students who get free tuition from the top 5 or so schools.  There are many other good private and public schools which provide partial or full scholarships for good students.  Some examples include Texas A&M, Duke, and Dartmouth[1].<p>Also, any high schooler in Georgia who graduates with at least a 3.0 GPA gets 4 years worth of tuition to an in-state university (including Georgia Tech) as long as they hold that GPA through college[2].  The University of Alabama has something similar as well.  There are other optiosn which base the tuition scholarships on ACT scores [3].  Here are 26 schools with achievement-based and 15 schools with need-based scholarships [4] (There&#x27;s starting to be some overlap in my lists)<p>These don&#x27;t all include the total cost (housing and food), but there are other grants and scholarships that could help with that.  I&#x27;m sure part of the problem is making kids aware of these opportunities.  I can see how, if they don&#x27;t have good guidance counselors, they may just assume nothing like them exists.  It would be interesting to see some statistics on how many students take advantage of these opportunities.

We have æ/Æ and ø/Ø (distinct, in theory, from the symbol for the empty set, btw), while å/Å used to be written aa/AA a long time ago (but is obviously not a result of combining two a&#x27;s). Swedish uses ö/Ö for essentially ø/Ø, ä/Ä for æ/Æ. And both of those I can only easily type by combining the dot-dot, with o/O, a/A because my Norwegian keyboard layout has key for/labelled øæå, not öäå.<p>For Japanese (and Chinese and a few others) things are even more complicated. It&#x27;s tricky to fit ~5000 symbols on a keyboard, so typically in Japan one types on either a phonetic layout, or a latin layout, and translate to Kanji as needed (eg: &quot;nihongo&quot; or &quot;にほんご&quot; is transformed to &quot;日本語&quot; -- note also that &quot;ご&quot; itself is a compound character, &quot;ko&quot; modified by two dots to become &quot;go&quot; -- which may or may not be entered as a compound, with a modifier key).<p>As I currently don&#x27;t have any Japanese input installed under xorg, that last bit I had to cut and paste.<p>It is entirely valid to view ø as a combination of o and a (short) slash, or å as a combination of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;°&quot; -- but if one does that while typing, it is important that software handles the compound correctly (and distinct from ligatures, as mentioned above). My brother&#x27;s name, &quot;Ståle&quot; is five letters/symbols long, if reversed it becomes &quot;elåtS&quot;, not &quot;el°atS&quot; (six symbols).<p>So, yeah, it&#x27;s complicated. Remember that we&#x27;ve spent many years fighting the hack that was ascii, extended ascii (which may be (part of) why eg: Norwegian gets to have å rather than a+°). You still can&#x27;t easily use utf8 with neither C nor, as I understand it C++ (almost, but not quite -- AFAIK one easy workaround is to use QT&#x27;s strings if one can have qt as a dependency -- and it&#x27;s still a mess on Windows, due to their botched wide char hacks... etc).<p>All in all, while it&#x27;s nice to think that one can take some modernized, English-centric ideas evolved from the Gutenberg press, and mash it together with what constitutes a &quot;letter&quot; (How hard is it to reverse a string!? How hard is it to count letters!? How hard is it to count words?!) -- that approach is simply wrong.<p>There will always be magic, and there&#x27;ll be very few things that can be said with confidence to be valid across all locales.

The sender can no longer access the referenced object; the compiler prevents that.  That&#x27;s the safe way to do it.  This is a significant advance in multi-thread programming.  The rules that make this work are strikingly simple. Somebody should have thought of this 20 or 30 years ago, but as far as I know, nobody did.  Rust pushes the single-owner model hard, and it seems to work.  The C++ crowd beat their head against the wall on this for decades, through three generations of auto_ptr, then unique_ptr.  Really getting it right requires something like the Rust borrow checker, which C++ does not have.<p>Go does not do anything to prevent sharing data between threads.  It&#x27;s very easy in Go to unwittingly create shared data, because slices are references. After you&#x27;ve sent a reference, the sender still has access to the shared data, as does the receiver, so there&#x27;s a potential race condition.   Go does nothing to prevent this. There&#x27;s a lot of dancing around this issue in &quot;(In)effective Go&quot;, and long discussions of &quot;is this a race condition&quot; in Go forums.

Please avoid UltraFire and TrustFire cells. Those are refurbished used cells with a new shrink wrap and an protection that likely does not work.<p>Please stick to proper brands: e.g. Samsung SDI is producing good affordable high drain cells. AW and Efest are also well known for good Chinese cells. Avoid Sony cells. Sony never sold to end customers. All so called Sony cells are either completely fake, or used cells e.g. from Makita screw drivers.<p>Next about protected vs unprotected. Thats a question of maximum drain vs maximum capacity. E.g. a good 18650 has a typical capacity around 2000mAh as a high drain unprotected IMR cell, or 3000mAh as a low drain protected ICR cell. IMR and ICR are different chemistries. And most important IMR only vents a bit, while ICR explodes. A rule of thump is therefore: Use a protected ICR in a lower power mechanical flashlight. The protection will kick in and save your battery and hands, in case of a short or voltage drops under 3V under drain. You can use unprotected IMR batteries in regulated devices because the regulation will protect your batteries. And you need to use unprotected IMR batteries for high power (>20 Watts) regulated devices, because protection kicks in to early thinks you have a short, and you need the high drain of IMR.",1426644360

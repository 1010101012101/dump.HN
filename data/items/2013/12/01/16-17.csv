It is a known concept in psychology.<p>It is achieved when skill level is high and challenge level is high.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29</a><p>Flow is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does. Proposed by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, this positive psychology concept has been widely referenced across a variety of fields.<p>Flow theory postulates three conditions that have to be met to achieve a flow state:<p><pre><code>    One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and progress. This adds direction and structure to the task.[11]\n    The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. This helps the person negotiate any changing demands and allows him or her to adjust his or her performance to maintain the flow state.[11]\n    One must have a good balance between the perceived challenges of the task at hand and his or her own perceived skills. One must have confidence that he or she is capable to do the task at hand.[11]\n</code></pre>\nHowever, it was argued that the antecedent factors of flow are interrelated, as a perceived balance between challenges and skills requires that one knows what he or she has to do (clear goals) and how successful he or she is in doing it (immediate feedback). Thus, a perceived fit of skills and task demands can be identified as the central precondition of flow experiences.[12]",1385916694

NSF and DARPA will read project\ndesigns on paper, but the VCs won&#x27;t.<p>What the VCs want for a Series A round is\nessentially in one word, <i>traction</i>.

Okay, consider 100,000\nuniques, on average:  Considering what my site does,\n100,000 uniques would mean about 500,000 visits;\neach visit sees 6 Web pages, with 4 ads per page;\nand I get paid, in effect, $2 per 1000 ads displayed\n(drawing from the Mary Meeker data at KPCB).  Then\nmy monthly revenue would be<p>500,000 * 6 * 4 * 2 / 1000 = 24,000<p>dollars at which time no thanks seed or series A and\nwelcome some new computers and a new car!  If the\nsite keeps growing, and once it gets to 100,000\nuniques it should, start hiring and grow just\norganically.<p>> Of course, you don&#x27;t always need VC to run a\ncompany.<p>Yup.  My first server might be an 8 core AMD\nprocessor at 4.0 GHz with maybe 32 GB of ECC main\nmemory and 12 TB of hard disk in a mid-tower case\nfor about $1500 and software, Windows Server and SQL\nServer, from the Microsoft BizSpark program.  From\nmy software timings, that server might be enough for\nthe $24,000 a month in revenue at which time I can\nget a $100 wire rack from Sam&#x27;s Club, put maybe 12\nsuch servers on it.<p>My software is written for such\n<i>scalability</i> now -- e.g., so far I&#x27;m using SQL\nServer essentially only as a key-value store so that\neach SQL Server table (there are only a few tables\nin the SQL Server schema) can be in its own running\ninstance of SQL Server with no communications among\nthe instances; for the various servers, there can be\na lot of parallelism via <i>sharding</i>, etc.<p>E.g., I wrote my own session state store; the\ntimings indicate that on a single core running at\n4.0 GHz I should be able to do the work needed to\nsend 2000 Web pages a second; such a store is easy\nto <i>parallelize</i> (partition the collection of\npossible keys and have one server for each\npartition); and a few racks of such servers could do\nenough for session state to serve the world and\nbuild a big company.<p>For a seed round, that now can be as high as a few\nmillion dollars and no longer limited just to, say,\n$200,000, the VCs want to see the running software\nand &quot;play with it&quot;.<p>So, soon, maybe later today, more likely before next\nSunday, my software should be ready to be <i>played\nwith</i> over the Internet.<p>This software development has taken a while as I\nlearned enough about essentially <i>system\nadministration</i> and Microsoft&#x27;s .NET Framework to\nget good with such <i>infrastructure</i>.  For the .NET\nFramework, I found, downloaded, indexed, and studied\nabout 5000 Web pages from Microsoft&#x27;s MSDN Web site.\nYes, my code is awash in comments with tree names on\nmy file system of such Web pages.  So, when I&#x27;m\nreviewing code and have a question, e.g., a TCP/IP\ntimeout parameter, one keystroke in my favorite\neditor pops up the relevant MSDN Web page.  In the\nend, I have found the .NET Framework to be nice, but\nthe 5000 pages took a while.<p>I actually studied all those 5000 pages; at 10 pages\na day, that&#x27;s 500 days just for the MSDN Web pages,\nand in the end I spent more than that.<p>Heck, I did the research for my Ph.D. dissertation\nindependently in my first summer in graduate school,\nabout 12 weeks, did a second pass later in about 2\nmonths, wrote and ran some illustrative software in\nabout 2 months, and did the final writing and typing\nin about six weeks.  Those 5000 Web pages from MSDN\nmean that at times I have been known to scream to\nthe point of a sore throat at what I regard as some\nreally poor technical writing at MSDN.<p>In the end, once understood, the .NET Framework is\nnice and not very difficult to use, but going from\nthe first day with .NET, through 5000 Web pages and\nmaybe a cubic foot of books to some good facility\ncan be a bit much.<p>My whole project is now a surprisingly large number\nof lines of code (maybe I will add them up\ntomorrow), but the work unique to my project was\neasy once the <i>system administration</i> independent of\nmy project was done.  E.g., SQL Server installation\nwas an unanesthetized root-canal procedure (once\nwiped out my boot partition).  My software\ninstallation got wiped out by a virus in an Akamai\ndownload manager I used to get a PDF file from an\nAsus Web site.  There were more such problems, all\nindependent of my work.<p>For my project, I created and derived the basic core\napplied math in a few days and typed it into Knuth&#x27;s\nTeX in a few more days; the software unique to my\nproject has been easy for me; but the <i>routine</i>\nsoftware part has been grim.<p>The last thing I did, as of last night, was finish\nthe code to have the code of a Web page communicate\nwith a server, in my architecture, a <i>Compute\nServer</i>, for the core work.  So, it&#x27;s a simple\nTCP/IP socket application.  .NET <i>streams</i> over\nTCP/IP might have been easier; maybe I rewrote some\nof that functionality.<p>I avoided such <i>streams</i> because the MSDN\ndocumentation seemed too sparse to give me good\nconfidence in what I really might encounter and have\nto consider, and I didn&#x27;t want to write and run test\ncases to clarify just what such streams would and\nwouldn&#x27;t do.  For what I did write, based just on\nthe basics of TCP/IP sockets, &quot;the workhorse of the\nInternet&quot;, that I&#x27;ve had experience with for a long\ntime, there was little question about how to write\nthe software or what it would do.  So, it was easier\njust to stand on basic TCP/IP than to make sense of\nMicrosoft&#x27;s documentation of the <i>streams</i> they\nwrote to use TCP/IP.<p>I put the data to be sent to/from the server code\nfor a Web page and one of my <i>compute servers</i> in an\ninstance of a class, <i>serialize</i> the instance to a\nbyte array, and send the byte array via TCP/IP.<p>> It was actually easier for me to get another\nwell-paid SysAdmin job than to get a job at wal-mart\nor the coffee shop, even at the depth of the dot-com\ncrash in 2001.<p>Wow, but I can believe it.",1385916468

Perhaps it is, but things are not quite as grim.<p>Here is what is likely to happen as a result of bitcoin: 1. The future of banking transaction fees is bleak - The current financial systems will get threatened and adapt. Here bitcoin will succeed. 2. Bitcoin is used as proof of concept and paves the way for a world currency, think euro but global.<p>The two points above are definitely wins. If you have any problems with those playing out, its likely you have the same concerns about bitcoin and just haven&#x27;t realized it yet.<p>Here is what would likely happen to bitcoin v1, it will fail to become a real currency.<p>Its currently morphing into a speculative store of value. I&#x27;d like to say its like tulips, but I&#x27;d be wrong, as it is definitely more useful than tulips. On the speculation front it may play out like the tulip mania/bubble, but I hope I&#x27;m wrong about that.<p>The reason for it to fail as a currency is the very reason for the spike in interest at the moment. Exchange rates seem to be soaring and may continue to soar which would make people vary of buying some thing worth $1000 USD for 1btc if there is a possibility that deferring a purchase by a couple of days could offer a notion discount of x% from the hope of the value of btc increasing. If you could wait a few days for the purchase and buy the $1000 item for 0.8btc, who wouldn&#x27;t wait?<p>On the flip-side, if you bought 1btc for $1000 to buy something but the value of btc suffered a temporary squeeze to the effect that 1btc = $800, hence the same item now costs you 1.25btc or 25% premium to what you were willing to pay. Hence who would be willing to pay extra if you were sure the value of btc would rise?<p>This applies to all commercial transactions. In 90%+ of cases people will likely defer spending btc unless the value was at the same level +/- 5% as their purchase price.<p>Bitcoin as a currency/for commerce will leave every consumer in a constant state of buyers remorse and THAT will be the real reason for its failure.",1385916407

It&#x27;s not like you can work double the hours and get double the salary. Even if you generate a great discovery, the salary increment, if any, is comparably modest --- orders of magnitude smaller than for example the bonuses one gets on Wall Street for a successful quarter of sales of shady investments to unsuspecting investors.<p>As an illustration: A colleague of mine who&#x27;s at the top of his field just negotiated a raise, (using a competing offer from an Ivy League school), and do you know what his raise was? ... He got an additional $15,000 per year to his salary of around $140k. After taxes he&#x27;ll get around $600 or $700 per month extra. Now tell me again about the riches of being a tenured prof?

Those stealing, bribing folks did quite well in the communism-to-capitalism transformation period but many well educated people could not adopt and moved to well established capitalist economies where the meritocracy existed(at least they were finding jobs based on their credentials). However, at least my parents, never grasped the idea of entrepreneurship. They just don&#x27;t have the basic instincts for doing a business and they failed miserably when they tried to start one. They are still working for other people.<p>If the North Korean government fails, probably the turmoil will last for generations, until new culture emerges through a new generation of young people who can have an idea about how a capitalist society works.<p>PS: We were from a discriminated minority, so maybe it was easier for the native Bulgarians however the North Korea seems to be much worse even than the last days of the communist Bulgaria.",1385915329

Anyone who&#x27;s integrated with a payment processor to run an online business will appreciate the value offered by crypto currencies.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think BTC is that currency, it&#x27;s built in limit is a terrible idea conceived from the mind of someone who doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between money and commodities.  BTC will never be a good currency, it&#x27;ll never be stable enough.  BTC is e-gold, not e-cash, and it&#x27;ll suffer the same fate as gold, that of a value holding commodity but not a currency.  However, that&#x27;s a petty flaw easily fixed and BTC paved the way for a whole market of crypto currencies by being open source with each trying slightly different approaches based on different ideas about how currencies work.  This is awesome.  Regardless of which few crypto currencies eventually dominate, it is the future.",1385913757

Using photographic techniques to make a painting does not guarantee a photographic &quot;look.&quot;  If you look at Warhol&#x27;s traced drawings, the only clue is an even, utilitarian line, he was clearly not interested in copying visual reality (or he gave up on it when he realized it wasn&#x27;t that easy to do from a projection). As counterpoint to that, you can look at Ingres&#x27; drawings, which are a world apart (it&#x27;s likely he used a camera lucida, judging from the small size of the drawings and type of line).  There is ample opportunity for the artist to bridge the &quot;technological&quot; gap with their own effort and ability, and it&#x27;s likely this would happen to different degrees.<p>If using unconventional tools is part of your assigning value to artwork/artists or not, is another question.",1385913619

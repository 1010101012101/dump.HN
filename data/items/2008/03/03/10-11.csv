127985,story,,,30,37,lyime,"Any hardware hackers here at YC?",,"Well here at YC I see a lot of startup talk surrounding software and the web, which I am totally down with. I do have a huge passion about hardware and electronic design. Any of you out there with passion in hardware? Perhaps a startup around hardware? \nPersonally I want to be involved with a software and hardware startup some-point in my life. I think we have many software/web startups and not enough startups in hardware. I might be wrong. Thoughts?",1204541902
127984,comment,127711,127921,0,0,Tichy,,,"Spanking is not telling what is wrong. If the 2 year old child can not yet understand the rules, how can it be fair to punish them? If it can't understand words, why should it magically understand being hit?<p>Just go out on the street and look at people walking their dogs. Do you think  it makes a lot of sense if those people get angry with their dogs, you know the kind who go ""bad doggy"" all the time and have full conversations with their dogs? I don't think it does, because dogs can not even understand what these people are saying. They are fooling themselves, and so apparently are you with your communication with kids (I mean it seems to be a human error). (I know the dog can probably understand it did something wrong, even if not WHAT it did wrong, but I hope you know what kind of people I am talking about - a lot of time the human-dog communication just doesn't make sense, but humans somehow fool themselves).",1204541901

127980,comment,127711,127865,0,0,Tichy,,,"Oh my god this thread is really shocking! So because you can not reason logically with a two year old, you somehow think that if you spank them, they will make the logical connection? That doesn't add up - either they are capable of understanding, then it shouldn't matter if you say ""no"" or hit them (in a logical sense, emotionally of course there is a difference). Or they are not capable of making the connection. In which case what you are trying to do is conditioning them, rooting ""being hit by daddy"" into their nervous system - maiming their soul! I can't believe this thread, really.",1204541545

After a while you might want to take a look under the hood and see just what .NET is generating and that might introduce you to some of the alternatives to just straight .NET - but you will be doing that with a lot more knowledge.",1204541226

I wish more webcast existed for Java, Groovy, Javascript, Perl, Grails, Catalyst, Spring framework!<p>The soup to nuts series covers everything, similarly other webcast series, the idea is simple and very effective, you will spend your first 10 or so hours looking as vidoes and presentations, next you can move to books and online forums and blogs<p>After he finishes these webcast, moving to RoR will be a much simpler road, even when RoR is a different framework",1204541006

127963,comment,127711,127794,0,0,tokipin,,,"i don't have any children of my own but i lived with my family while my younger brothers were growing up.  none of us ever had to hit them.  to me hitting a child is a dangerous shortcut to explaining things.  if they recognize you care about them, why shouldn't they listen?  that's what i saw in my brothers.  they listened because they respected, in a true sense, their elders. violence will destroy their respect for you and alienate them<p>they don't have to understand every word you say because they can hear compassion.  i think if violence has to be used in a relationship, it's a broken relationship.  but perhaps most parents don't see it as a relationship where respect has to go both ways.  if your child is having tantrums against you, and not listening to you, something went wrong long ago, and using that as evidence that children can't be reasoned with is fallacious",1204539278
127962,comment,127734,127734,0,0,sungam,,,"The limitation of SNP techniques is that the magnitude of association between a particular allele and a disease have turned out to be rather low - in the order of 1-2 times increased risk. This is virtually meaningless on an individual level - for example if there is a 1:1000 risk of a particular disease in the population and you have the risk allele you would still only have a 1:500 risk of getting the condition.<p>A possible explanation for this is that that all of the alleles that are tested in genome wide association studies are found relatively frequently in the population - it may be that rare alleles exist that confer far greater risk e.g. 10-100 increase and it is these that mediate the majority of the inherited risk of a condition. These rare alleles could not be detected by a microarray based approach but would be identified by massive resequencing. A preliminary resequencing effort is already underway: <a href=""http://www.1000genomes.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.1000genomes.org/</a> and within the next few years whole genome resequencing on an individual basis will become feasible with massively paralell techniques such as Selexa.",1204539230

It engages a different part of your mind, and is very valuable even when you do go back to computer-based work.<p>The best you can hope for when paying through the nose for college is that some prof you run into will have some subtle but deep insight that you couldn't, or wouldn't have stumbled on through self-directed learning.

If you've ever worked with a good interaction designer, the best thing you can do is let them write views in something as close to HTML as possible. Every attempt to auto-generate sections of the view is something that will need to be worked around at some point.
A lot of these frameworks seem to come from the mentality that design is just a programming problem that can be solved by pushing code out from the backend.
A lightweight templating language (smarty, velocity, etc etc) should be all you really need. Poking holes in the HTML and inserting data is precisely the right way to do it.",1233856226

However some people either can't get enough in government-backed loans or fail to qualify or are stupid.. or something.. and so they hit up the private lenders which prey on them something terrible. I never went private so I'm not really sure, but I suppose another reason to go with private loans is so you can spend the money on things much more disconnected from your education costs - like a car. I seem to remember the government loans being pretty tightly tied to the school and thus it wasn't like I could borrow more than the cost of school without going outside the government-backed loans.

The formal education (in the US) that is guaranteed to everyone ends with high school. Why should it extend indefinitely? And why must college be considered a possibility immediately after high school? IMO, we need to insert a cultural cue that hints that it is okay to graduation high school, work a bit, save up some money, and then hit up college in a couple years when you can pay for it. It'd be a decent compromise and might make the ones who take the leap appreciate it even more.",1233855983

A lot of effort is put into technologies that allow ""non-programmers"" to work with these tiers of app development, and I think they generally backfire.<p>The most common one is tag libraries in place of scripting.  The Java world is probably the biggest offender here.  The JSTL started out as a way to create cleaner looking pages - and maybe it has - but the spec got to the point where they were recreating the entire Java language as a separate set of tags.  Supposedly, these tags are easier for ""non-programmers"" to use, but by the time you're setting properties for objects and using conditionals and loops, you may as well admit you're a programmer.<p>I'm no big fan of long jsp pages, but I prefer Rails's approach to scripting: if a task requires programming logic, use a programming language.<p>Ultimately, I found the ""you're doing it wrong if you include scripting in a view"" to be very unconvincing, especially if the tags you replace it with end up recreating the programming language you're not supposed to be using in the first place.",1233855145

Including this one.<p>What I find interesting is the + and - votes often appear to be attempts to deny or affirm the truth of the post in opposition to its actual truth content.  Its as if mere expression of an opinion contains the expectation of being able to coerce reality to agree and that a counter opinion can cancel that effect. Its Postmodern philosophy in full flower.  Kant would be proud of his intellectual children.<p>Thankfully, there does seem to be much less adherence to Postmodern philosophy on this list compared to others which is why I bother with this list.  However, the philosophy lives deeply inside the Karma feature.<p>The fact remains, that throughout history, what most people believe to be true has little to do with what is actually true.  Any new truth that is discovered, is discovered first by a single individual.  If that truth is fundamental, it will be rejected by ""common sense"" and ""consensus"" until at least one generation has passed - likely several.  So also a crackpot notion of a crank will take at least a generation to pass or at least the death of the crank.  The age of a ""truth"" has a poor correspondence to what is actually true.<p>The net of this is each is responsible for filtering the noise coming at him and finding the few gems of truth it contains.  There is always the possibility of being wrong.  Karma scores are simply irrelevant accumulations of noise signals.  Sorry, that is the nature of the beast.",1233853608

Grading these competitions is hard, since it depends on taste and you can't always tell from a short example how something will perform in the field. haml may be a bit <i>too</i> terse (though I say that without being convinced that it's true; terse is generally good), and on first glance it will confuse the daylights out of an otherwise HTML-savvy person who has never seen it before.

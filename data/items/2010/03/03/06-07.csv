I use the emulator to make sure everything runs smoothly at higher resolutions and on newer releases of Android, but such details simply don't get as much attention since I don't interact with them day-to-day.  I'm sure that when my Nexus or Droid comes, I'll focus more on those little details.<p>So this is a way of ensuring that the most popular apps work beautifully on the flagship phones, as well as creating some positive publicity and developer goodwill.<p>And of course, I'm delighted.

That's to be expected; most of these guys will never leave .NET/Java and the blessed toolkits associated with each. They are corporate programmers and they don't really count.<p>A well-informed person might make some good social arguments against NoSQL adoption, like the lack of experienced available developers, or the relative immaturity of the respective codebase, or other issues that surround emerging platforms. These arguments will sometimes hold merit.<p>Otherwise, I don't know why one would be averse to the implementation of a ""NoSQL"" datastore for information like logs. I know that I've always having logs in the relational db.<p>I haven't met many experienced, decent developers who shun NoSQL when there is a good technical and environmental atmosphere for its implementation.

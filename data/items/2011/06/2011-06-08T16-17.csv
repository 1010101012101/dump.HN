I will not develop an app for Apple again and abandoned a ""startup"" based around app customization.<p>I developed an app with a partner, released it to App Store then took it down to upload it under a new account. Same app.<p>Apple rejected our app. They refused to explain by email why. They insisted on only dealing with me by phone. Over the phone they said the policies had changed in the last two weeks and my app would not be accepted. I asked which policy and they refused to say which one. I asked what I could do to get back in the app store and they said they couldn't tell me. I suggested some ideas and the Apple employee on the other end of the phone said that those would be ""helpful"" but they couldn't say that that would be enough to get my app listed again.<p>Time to cut and run. I cancelled both orders for customized versions of the app that I had taken from clients (and apologized profusely). I asked Apple for a refund on my developer account. They refused. I said that since the policies had changed then I was entitled to a refund because I bought the account under the old policies and if they'd like to change the terms and I don't agree then I'm entitled to have my money refunded. They said it was a ""one time exception"" but grudgingly refunded my developer account.",1307552391

2633942,comment,2633341,2633341,3,0,scythe,,,">I pulled up his video U.S. History Overview 3World War II to Vietnam<p>Well, there's your problem. If you concern yourself primarily with US History, as Khan does (and declares what he is doing), you're going to necessarily ignore a lot of non-US perspectives, like, y'know, Leningrad, Churchill, the rape of Nanking, Japan's lack of oil reserves, the whole bit. The real question is not whether Mr. Khan did a poor job of explaining US History, it is whether the idea of teaching ""$country history"", when we concern ourselves primarily with foreign affairs as Mr. Khan does, whether focusing on the actions of $country in an era of global politics gives a skewed and ultimately inaccurate perspective. The answer to that should be a rather obvious 'yes'...<p>I do doubt however that Mr. Khan truly hopes to achieve or at least does not really believe that he can achieve a monopoly in education. Perhaps his format will be copied but I doubt his lectures themselves will become the <i>status quo</i> especially if they are as lacking in depth as the example shown (I am not really familiar with the Khan Academy). The graver problem shown in the article does not really concern the Khan Academy but rather our method of consuming information from a general standpoint, and the dangers of the personalization of news; but this is a rather tired complaint, and the author does not suggest a novel approach for combatting it.",1307552338

In practice, you get into the situation where the designer doesn't encounter all those tags on a limited mockup page. Then when it comes time to build out the site, and the developer or author tries to format a list, or emphasize text with a <strong> element, neither has any effect at all. When it comes to visual style, any element not explicitly allowed by the CSS designer is denied.<p><strong> elements should generally show some kind of emphasis, probably boldface, but a full CSS reset sets them back to plain text. If all you've gained from the full reset is the opportunity to forget to set them back to boldface, what was the point?<p>This project looks like an attempt to retain the most useful properties of a CSS reset (like consistent default element margins) while forestalling the process of redefining each element piecemeal to look pretty much like what the browser would have shown in the first place.",1307552064

You are inspiring me to study maths.<p>I have a Ba in history and agree with the criticism raised in the article, however I also think it is a problem that many people dont even have a basic scaffold of world events.<p>History is about making choices, what to say and what not to say, and the way to say it, it is not merely about being familiar with major world events. What is a major world event? Lets go with WW2 , then when you dig into WW2, what would you say is a major event? Fall of France, D-Day, Fall of Yugoslavia,  or Stalingrad? Whatever you choose you exclude another event, your choices influences the further storytelling. You have to make choices.<p>The solution for this problem is very difficult, since you have to begin somewhere in your story-telling, and even when choosing where to begin you take a side. And that side is with you for the rest of the story telling.<p>History is not merely about events it is also about connecting dots, you can begin by choosing any event and really digging into it until you begin to see the wider picture. Going the other way around is far more difficult, when you attempt to give an overview of the wider picture. You get exactly what you would if you picked 2m wide brushes to draw on a wall.<p>My suggestion instead is to pick really small pencils and draw thinner lines, introduce the students to any event in world history and work out from there.  Only then the students could enjoy seeing (and make themselves) the wider connections.<p>A teacher in a classroom faces the same problems as you (and more, imagine 20 teenagers), so dont worry about it. :)",1307552033

Carbonite Support: With Carbonite's ""Remote File Access"" you can remotely download individual files to any internet enabled computer.<p>1. Log into your account at  https://account.carbonite.com
2. Click 'View Files' for the backup you wish to access remotely.
3. Navigate to the file you wish to restore by clicking on the folder names to display the contents and subfolders.
4. Once you have located the file you wish to restore, click on it and a dialog box will open.
5. Save the file on your computer to a location of your choosing.
6. Open the file and view or edit the contents.<p>Me: But if I wanted to write my own program to access them...do you have any sort of system that allows this?
Carbonite Support: Unfortunately, Carbonite does not backup the program files and system files. So, I do not think you would be able to access the files for a writing a program. However, if you can download the files and then try to write the program. This is definitely possible.

Of course some elites are brilliant thinkers but DC is not exactly a hotbed of intellectual curiosity these days, and governance suffers.<p>Historical study can reveal a lot about the contradictions of ideology, the gap between political rhetoric/narrative vs reality.

2633878,comment,2630867,2632448,5,0,gruseom,,,"For fun, I'm going to write my thoughts before reading what you said about it elsewhere in the thread.<p><i>What do you think of short methods?</i><p>I'm skeptical of them. I think it's a mistake to try to make functions short for the sake of making them short. It's a mistake because adding a new function also adds complexity (i.e. more code, plus opacity between the calling and called) - not a lot, but greater than zero - so introducing a function is not cost-free and its benefit needs to be greater than its cost. I found that once I started asking functions to justify themselves this way, I began creating fewer functions and the overall complexity of my code went down.<p>Factoring code into functions is one of the best tools we have, of course, but people commonly make the mistake of applying it mechanically. A function should exist when the program itself wants that concept, not because you had a block of code that was too big or some duplication and you wanted to rearrange the pieces. The way to address those symptoms is not by adding more code but by <i>thinking</i> until you see how you were looking at the problem wrongly. Then the new concepts, and finally the new functions, appear by themselves.<p>You only have so many conceptual cards to play and must play them sparingly if you don't want your program to succumb to runaway complexity. A good function is a logical construct that makes sense in the meaning of the program the way a good word makes sense and adds a unique meaning to a language, something you can't quite say as well any other way.<p>When all you're doing is shifting pieces around, you're missing the most important thing about functions, which is this conceptual payload. After you do that for a while, your program stops evolving as an expression of the problem being solved, because you've built it out of primitives that refer only to the internals of the program rather than to concepts drawn from the problem space.<p>Side note. I'm writing at such length here and in the GP because these questions are on my mind all the time. I've been working on a hard problem for over two years now in an utterly immersed way, the kind where you dream about it every night, where time itself begins to blur. Our approach has been to evolve the program many times until it converges on a solution. The only way to do this is if the program doesn't grow as you evolve it. How do you build a system such that you're constantly adding new information and behavior to it, and yet the overall code doesn't grow? We've had to figure this out just to stay alive.<p>One more thing about function length - Steve McConnell cites studies that suggest that short functions aren't easier to understand. IIRC the sweet spot was between 50 and 100 lines, depending of course on the language. I've posted references to this on HN before. One should be careful about believing these studies because the empirical literature on software development is so poor. But it's at least interesting that such experimental evidence as exists runs counter to the ""OO short methods"" school.",1307551631

It makes sense for Office-type apps to provide a PDF, or Office-compatible format, but I could imagine very specific apps that can lock you in since you don't get to (easily) reverse-engineer and convert their data because you don't get as easy of an access as you get on a desktop.",1307551625

They're either unreliable in connecting to my bank (Mint) or have an unfriendly user interface (Quicken). Personally, I'm after daily spending reports which are emailed out, a database of past transactions I can query easily, etc, etc.<p>Problem is, my current bank makes it a bit difficult to do this reliably. I manage to get my transactions today using Sikuli to log in to the account and download an OFX file, which is great. However, the OFX file itself often truncates the description of the transaction in such a way that you can't even tell who the money was paid to. It's pretty random in this way...for some vendors it prepends their address in the transaction description, for others, all it puts is their address. This may be the fault of the debit card/credit card processors themselves, not sure. Regardless, it is frustrating.<p>Plus, it shouldn't have to be this way. I'd really like to have a bank which: 
- Provides some sort of API to get access to transactions, or at least makes it very easy to download transactions in an automated fashion
- Reliably marks transactions which go to a particular vendor<p>Any of you know a bank that does this, or does similar things to make a hacker's life easier?<p>Thanks in advance.",1307550799

I wanted to respond directly on the author's page, but they seem to be having a problem taking comments.<p>The reason why I make history videos is that many people I know (many of whom are quite educated) don't even have a basic scaffold of world events in their minds (or the potential causality between events).  Most American high school and college students would find it difficult to give even a summary of the Vietnam War or the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Many of these people have sat through years of traditional history classes (taught through state-mandated books by ""experts"").  Even more worrying is many experts who have taken one side or another of a historical issue and view their viewpoints as facts (this is the tone of most history books).<p>If the author really watched my videos, he would see that I start most of them telling the listener to be skeptical of anything I tell them or anyone tells them; that no matter how footnoted something is, in the end it is dependent on people's accounts--the people who weren't killed--which are subject to bias (no matter how well-intentioned).  Very few history books or professors do this.  If anything, they create a false sense of certainty.<p>As for the ""one voice"" issue, I don't see how a guy making digestible videos that inform and encourage skepticism (on YouTube where anyone else can do the same) are more dangerous than state-mandated text books.  I don't see how lectures that are open for the world to scrutinize (and comment about on YouTube and our site) are more dangerous than a lone teacher or professor who can say whatever they like to their classrooms with no one there to correct or dispute them.<p>Finally, there is nothing I would like to see more than other teachers/professors/experts adding their voice to the mix.  Rather than wasting energy commenting on other people's work with pseudo-intellectual babble, why don't they produce their own videos and post them on YouTube?  If someone can produce 20 videos that seem decent and want to do more as part of the Khan Academy, we'll point our audience at them.  If our students respond, we'll figure out a way that they can potentially make it a career.<p>regards,
Sal",1307550667

Amazon has established that they would rather stop doing business with CA affiliates than (effectively) raise prices.<p>This should matter to you because affiliates are just the tip of the iceberg. One of the California proposals already contemplates that having subsidiaries, servers or _vendors_ in CA would establish a nexus. So let's say you're the entrepreneurs behind CloudKick (to use an already exited example from Y Combinator.) If these proposals had been law when they were looking for customers, they would have found many customers concerned that using CloudKick would obligate them to collect sales tax from their customers in California. Collecting the taxes would of course only be part of the issue - computing when and how much to collect in accordance with the latest version of the law in every state would be a significant burden.<p>The states of course are perfectly entitled to seek new revenue, especially in times of economic distress. However we believe lawmakers should stick to strategies that work. Historically these laws have resulted in _reduced_ tax revenue and job flight. (the merchants cut ties with affiliates in those states and the affiliates either move or cease operation.) They also make investment in these kinds of business models more challenging. For a state as dependent as California on innovation, we think this is just bad public policy. (Also the Performance Marketing Association has filed suit against the state of Illinois arguing that it's affiliate tax law is unconstitutional.) The correct place for this to be taken up is at the federal level since the federal government actually does have the right to impose taxes on interstate commerce. Senator Durbin of Illinois has announced he intends to introduce legislation to address this federally in the fall.<p>If you're still reading and you're motivated to do something, check out <a href=""http://25000businessesatrisk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://25000businessesatrisk.com/</a> for California or <a href=""http://performancemarketingassociation.com/nexus-tax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://performancemarketingassociation.com/nexus-tax</a> for the rest of the country.<p>Oliver Roup

Excerpts below from my series taking a critical view of Khan Academy: <a href=""http://bit.ly/khancritic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/khancritic</a> ...<p>Ironically, Khan's TED talk is in stark contrast to two previous TED talks:<p>* Dan Meyer - Math Curriculum Makeover <a href=""http://bit.ly/DanMeyerTED"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/DanMeyerTED</a>
* Sir Ken Robinson - Do Schools Kill Creativity? <a href=""http://bit.ly/SirKenTED"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/SirKenTED</a><p>According to Dan, todays math curriculum is teaching students to expect (and excel at) paint-by-numbers classwork, robbing kids of a skill more important than solving problems: formulating them. How does Khan Academy foster problem posing and creativity?<p>If your philosophy of education is sit-and-get, i.e., teaching is telling and learning is listening, then Khan Academy (and flipping) are more efficient than in-classroom lecturing.<p>But why lecture at all? TRUE progressive educators, TRUE education visionaries and revolutionaries dont want to do these things better. We want to DO BETTER THINGS.<p>Rather than instructing students with Khans videos, teachers should be inspiring them to figure things out on their own and learn how to create their own knowledge by working together. For example, instead of relying on lectures and textbooks, Modeling Instruction in Physics emphasizes active student construction of conceptual and mathematical models in an interactive learning community. Students are engaged with simple scenarios to learn to model the physical world. In comparison to traditional instruction, Modeling is extremely effective  under expert modeling instruction high school students average more than two standard deviations higher on a standard instrument for assessing conceptual understanding of physics.<p>Watch one Modeling class in action: <a href=""http://bit.ly/ModelingPhysics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/ModelingPhysics</a> . In the clip, the teacher says, I dont lecture at all. Instead, I create experiences for the students either in the lab or puzzles and problems for them to solve and its up to them to try to figure that out. Ive often wondered why this type of teaching hasnt gotten more attention in the media. Maybe because the teacher is using simple things like whiteboards and bowling balls rather than shiny iPads and SmartBoards?<p>While Khan argues that his videos now eliminate ""one-size-fits-all"" education, his videos are exactly that. I tried finding Khan Academy videos for my students to use as references for studying, or to use as a tutorial when theres a substitute teacher, but the physics ones aren't very good. They dont use a lot of the multiple representations that are so fundamental to learning. Concept development is minimal, and he unknowingly plays into student misconceptions. His videos do not align with proper Physics Education Research.  Teachers improve via reading up on pedagogy and getting feedback from mentors & students. Where is Sal's feedback? Where's the pedagogy?<p>The research that Khan chooses to ignore is summarized in this one book, now available as a free PDF: ""How Students Learn: History, Mathematics, and Science in the Classroom"" <a href=""http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10126"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10126</a>",1307549226

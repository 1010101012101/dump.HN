656897,comment,656174,656728,0,0,daeken,,,"Reversing and binary patching are two different but related arcane arts.  Reversing is the understanding, patching is the modification.  Many people do both, but just understanding one doesn't mean you can understand the other.  When it comes right down to it, binary patching can be done in a million different ways, regardless of how the reversing was done, and it doesn't get nearly the respect it deserves.  Most people tend to lump reversing and all related (binary patching, anti-anti-debugging magic, etc) arts together, but they all deserve separate discussions and explanations.<p>(Sorry for the extremely long winded, slightly off-topic reply.)",1244962259

656893,comment,656708,656726,0,0,Shooter,,,"Yep. I used to read any HN post from Posterous, because most of those early ones were from the actual Posterous founders and I was interested in what they had to say.  Most of the more recent ""Posterous.com"" links are just from people with Posterous blogs, so I've stopped reading them unless the title is very compelling.  Too many were a waste of time.  I wish people posted their blog's sub-domain information when they post on HN so that readers could make a more informed decision about whether or not to click through...",1244962035

656890,comment,656641,656874,0,0,zck,,,"I looked over Sterling's other posts before submitting a ""this guy's stealing from pg"" post, and came to a similar conclusion. I thought about it, and came to the conclusion that I don't like it, but it wasn't worth raising the alarm over. I still think this is a Bad Thing to do. His post didn't quote the whole thing, and links to the source, which are good. However, here are some of the things that bother me: He doesn't make it obvious that it is a quote -- the link doesn't have any helpful text; it's just a link. It doesn't say ""from pg"". He adds nothing of value. (This is arguably similar to reddit, boingboing, or, indeed, hacker news itself, but differs in that on those sites either a very small amount is quoted, or the quoting is obvious (see boingboing's quotes)).<p>So you're right -- this isn't plagarism, but I still think it's unethical, especially for someone at Wired.",1244961617

656882,comment,656713,656713,0,0,GavinB,,,"There's a common perception in the academic community that they face heavy resistance from those who think that ""death gives life meaning,"" and that ending aging would harm ""human dignity.""<p>These feelings may  be strong among philosophers and ethicists and the debate may rage in journals, but I don't think there's nearly so much resistance in the general population.<p>The challenge is proving that dramatic longevity extension is really possible.  Most of modern medicine is really treatment of symptoms, not cures. We don't understand or have effective treatments for the underlying causes of most conditions.",1244960698
656881,comment,656269,656440,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"Keep your eyes open -- basic office chairs seem to often be on sale at one place or another.  And sale prices often seem to knock a significant percentage off the normal price.  People can be rather particular about their chairs, though.  Make sure whatever you get is comfortable.  Some may want to pick or bring in their own.<p>You'll also want to make sure they roll ok on whatever you have as a floor.  It gets tiring quickly if every tuck in to and every pushing back and standing up is an effort.  Chair wheels are one factor.  But if the flooring is just uncooperative, there are plastic chair mats that can help.  They can also protect less durable flooring, if that is a concern.<p>With the Persbo table/desk, if you try that route, I would suggest getting just one at first and seeing what you think of it.  Tastes and performance needs vary, and I'd hate to steer you wrong if yours don't match mine.  You might also look at some of the other table tops, e.g. if you decide you need a harder (laminate) surface or something capable of a higher load.  Pay attention to the edges, though.  I find that sharp angles on the edges are significantly less comfortable.  I tend to lean on the table/desk edge at times, and they really dig in, then.<p>Good luck!<p>P.S.  Try typing on the Persbo top, as well, if you can.  I realize now that since it's lighter weight, it resonates a bit more with the typing and so makes the typing sound somewhat louder.  Especially in a shared workspace, this might bother some people (I know others' typing noise bothers me; however, the workspace I described is my own, private one, so this is not a factor for me in using the Persbo top).",1244960694

656878,comment,656641,656707,0,0,devin,,,"@Misuba -- I couldn't agree more.  This happens to be a common occurrence in closed communities, academic or otherwise.  No one writes within a vacuum, there is always a prior influence.<p>When someone within the community is dubbed a ""plagiarist"", that person is cast out to protect the false idea that everyone in the community is creating completely original work all the time.<p>Your point is apt; There are real spammers and plagiarists out there.  To nitpick over a clear quote within a blog post is just our antennas perking up and realizing that most of what we write isn't as ground breaking or original as we'd like to believe.  It's convenient for us to rally around how original we are, instead of coming to grips with how unoriginal it all really is.",1244960641
656877,comment,656380,656844,0,0,jibiki,,,"I don't know about that, I think it's good that someone is looking at the risks of runaway AI and similar things.  Progress relies upon a certain diversity of thought, and that means that some people (and nearly all scientists) will end up wasting their lives looking down blind alleys, and none of us knows whether EY is one of them.  Your Dostoyevsky quote could well apply to Einstein, for instance, in his later years.",1244960449

656875,comment,656595,656691,0,0,bismitch,,,"Sometimes I think there is always a cynical response to any sensational news story, regardless of its validity. I guess it is important to see a controversial position from all sides, but in this case I think there is a clear conclusion (that the voting process was tampered with), that still stands regardless of one faulty statistical analysis of the data. In this case I wonder if it is a way to internally differentiate ourselves from what we would consider blind ignorant sheep of the liberal media.",1244960299

Granted, usually it's a lot more commentary.<p>A lot of people lately are being prodigal with the P word (the other P word, I mean: ""plagiarism"") in referring to blogs that quote at length. The blogs in question almost always make it clear that the quote is a quote. Sterling is less good at this, but his regular readers have no trouble and PageRank is not his goal. Can we please reserve our ire for the real plagiarists, which are plentiful?",1244960063

Gone out of my way a bit to walk past a few.<p>My girlfriend lived near Angel station, I'd walk past the children saluting the Tesco flag every day on the way to the gym. Tesco is an English grocery store, and the piece is pretty marvelously weaved into the environment.<p>Closeup:

9628875,comment,9628682,9628682,0,0,JosephMama,,,"I got diagnosed with a lymphoma (Hodgkin&#x27;s) in my early thirties.  Otherwise healthy also.  With your age and lumps in the armpit, it sounds like lymphoma.  Luckily, lymphoma treatment has a pretty good success rate.
A few things I would recommend.<p>Get a biopsy.  Getting cut open sucks, but until they take a tissue sample, they really can only guess.  Get it as soon as possible.<p>If you decide to take &#x27;normal&#x27; western treatments (chemo/radiation), before you start, bank sperm or eggs, depending on your sex.  I had a difficult time beating mine, and the chemos I eventually took left me sterile.<p>If you are an American, get in contact with the American Cancer Society.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this organization.  They should be able to help with financial options for you, as well as alternative therapies and medical trials.  If you qualify for some of the trials, the cost may be reduced.<p>If you decide to go with chemo, it affects different people differently.  I personally had 5 different types, with effects ranging from nauseous for a couple of days to unable to move.  You may be able to work through it, you may not.  But your co-employees will generally have nothing but empathy for you.<p>Don&#x27;t delay treatments.  The success rate only goes down with time.",1432958285

That was literally a critical piece of evidence at the trial. The defense tried to claim that it wasn&#x27;t Ulbricht&#x27;s and failed.<p>Take a look at the post I&#x27;m responding to here. A <i>lot</i> of people in this thread are acting like the murder for hire thing is just some crazy rumor when there is a really compelling body of evidence behind it. Reasonable people can disagree on whether it should be a factor in the sentencing in the drug trial, but to act like there isn&#x27;t a very high probability of Ross having attempted murder is..

Does it use regular firmware for its hardware or firmware hardened against attack? Are the drivers isolated in user-mode? Is the trusted software verified by eye, tool, or both to avoid all known code injections? Was that verified by third parties? Does it avoid software with huge TCB and many vulnerabilities such as Linux? Does it avoid Web apps and tech such as Flash?<p>If yes to all of these, then it&#x27;s a start on strong security and definitely worth reviewing if only to help close remaining holes.

And my old employers&#x27; coverage ends on the 31st. I&#x27;m going to check out Cobra to tide me over.  Does anyone have an opinion on the prospect of sticking with Cobra and perhaps asking my new employer to help out with the premium versus being on their health insurance?
If I did need to eventually transfer to their insurance I think new Healthcare Laws would mean I couldn&#x27;t be denied coverage due to pre-existing condition.

9628845,comment,9625862,9626907,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"First part: name one high assurance system Google has ever produced or a low assurance system that top tier hackers gave up on? Did their mobile OS have a strong TCB with POLA on the apps and trusted path? Did their web services use native code (minimal attack surface) with checks manually or automatically built in to stop most attacks? Did they perform a covert channel analysis on their cryptographic stuff? Do they know what those are unlike many INFOSEC types I meet? Has anything they designed used an architecture that made leaks or code injection nearly impossible? If not, then my statement stands until Google demonstrates the ability to make a secure product or one that approximates that. They haven&#x27;t caught up to Daniel Bernsteins&#x27; Qmail claims much less top-tier work like KeyKOS [1] or Burroughs [2]. Ancient, top tier work...<p>Re third parties. There are numerous academic teams doing hardware or compiler work on making Linux-based systems immune to code injection or at least isolated. OK Labs did OKL4 with user-mode Android for isolation. Samsung leveraged INTERGITY microvisor in Knox. Perseus Security Framework did something similar with a Linux personality, modified by Sirrix or SYSGO I believe for mobile. Control-pointer integrity does this on hardware supporting segments (x86). DIFT catches when incoming data screws with pointers and such, also ported to Linux. Automated diversification and keyed hardware SOC&#x27;s to make Linux probabilistically secure. Several methods ported to Linux to stops leaks or injection with crypto tricks. Many things Google could&#x27;ve used for mobile and non-mobile. NSA did SEAndroid. Then there&#x27;s Tor, modders, and Android developers tools/tips to lock down Android and turn off Google&#x27;s leaks. About everyone but Google did great work in securing Android.<p>To test you on your own claims, would you trust a vanilla Android installation&#x27;s security out of the box or make some modifications first? I&#x27;d mod it or assume I&#x27;m game for whoever.<p>re unqualified in strong INFOSEC<p>Everything you mention they, like IT in general, built on foundations of quicksand: low assurance hardware, firmware, and software that has regularly been defeated by skilled hackers. So, sure they pushed some good security technologies that stop low to mid-grade hackers or solve pieces of the puzzle (see my use of &quot;exceptions&quot;). Yet, Google themselves and their Android users were hacked with quite vanilla techniques due to their system and software architecture. There are systems in EAL6/7 and under SPOCK program that NSA pentesters couldn&#x27;t breach despite having 2+ years to try. Matasano said something similar about Secure64&#x27;s SourceT OS, too. The things they have in common is bottom-up, end-to-end, medium-to-highly assured (EAL6+) lifecycle. That&#x27;s strong requirements, design, implementation, analysis, testing, build, configuration, and independent verification of that. Google hasn&#x27;t done (censored) in this area despite having the brains to do so. Matter of fact, their smartest work IIRC was Native Client and it was smashed because they intentionally weakened the security model for performance reasons.<p>Almost all their stuff has been knocked down by serious hackers or subversions. It&#x27;s why they needed the bug bounty. Smart idea if you&#x27;re pushing low to mid grade throughout your whole stack. Didn&#x27;t stop the Chinese and NSA from smashing them. They didn&#x27;t even need esoteric techniques. The definition of high assurance security is the level of rigorous security engineering needed to resist well-funded, sophisticated threats with time on their hands. They never came close, so why do you trust them to do it now without proof? Trust, but verify.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.smecc.org/The%20Architecture%20%20of%20the%20Burroughs%20B-5000.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smecc.org/The%20Architecture%20%20of%20the%20Burr...</a>",1432957471

9628830,comment,9626985,9627149,0,0,tzs,,,"> See: privately owned prisons that require a quota to be filled<p>That&#x27;s not quite correct. The contracts do not require that a certain number of prisoners be kept in the prison. They require that a certain number be paid for. The contracts are essentially of the form that the state will pay $X to house up to Y prisoners, and $Z/prisoner for any prisoners beyond Y prisoners.<p>Since private prisons are only a small fraction of the prisons, the people that should be most annoyed by this are the employees of state run prisons. If crime goes down in a state and they want to close a prison to save money they most likely will make sure to fill the private prison first (since they are already paying for it) and cut staff at the state prisons.<p>(NOTE: this does NOT mean I&#x27;m saying private prisons are fine--just that contracts that guarantee a minimal payment regardless of occupancy are not necessarily bad. Private organizations tend to have less oversight than state run organizations, so it would not at all surprise me if the private prisons have staff that are not as well trained or as accountable as state prison staff. If I were setting up a prison system and it was going to allow private prisons, I&#x27;d probably require that the warden be appointed by and employed by and answer to the state, not the prison owner, and has the ability to fire private prison employees who are in jobs that involve direct interaction with the prisoners. I&#x27;d also require penalty clauses in the contracts that reduce payments if conditions are not at least as good as those required of state prisons.<p>It would be interesting to look at the strength of whatever public employee union represents state prison employees in each state, and see if there is a significant correlation between that and state use of private prisons. I&#x27;d expect weaker unions would increase the chances of private prisons.",1432957120

I enjoyed them up until the last ~75% or so of my senior year when I was really sick of the whole high school business. I don&#x27;t think the Latin had outside utility of any sort until the 2nd or 3rd year simply because I didn&#x27;t have the vocabulary (and I, like the vast majority of people, was unaware of spaced repetition and hated non-spaced repetition flashcards). The study of French and Roman culture and history was more interesting (and also fun when done in the respective languages) but due to the lack of slow history (<a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2010/09/slow-history-and-mysterious-20th.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2010/09/slow-hi...</a>) in modern education I&#x27;d say its utility was limited. That utility I got from Latin the language was mainly in deciphering a few words (or contemplating a deeper meaning behind them) instead of reaching for Google&#x27;s &quot;define:word&quot; -- but my vocabulary has lapsed and I don&#x27;t care to refresh it. The other form of utility was minor because I had already studied French for two years, and that utility is contemplation of different grammatical forms and how language is structured, which can improve communication skills. I had a great English grammar class in 8th grade, and that was basically it for serious study of English grammar, but learning French allowed me to reflect more on language grammar in general so when Latin came along it was just another thing to reflect on rather than starting the reflection itself, very marginal utility.<p>But these utilities really don&#x27;t justify the classes and resources on their own... If we want high school to produce the greatest amount of utilons, we should be explicit about that, but then many many things will need to change. I believe English should be the world language, there&#x27;s no practical reason to teach anything else at the expense of other more practical things to teach (like programming), especially in English speaking countries. If we want high school to more approximate what Universities used to represent, such as encouraging more Intellectualism (which I don&#x27;t think is all that great, at least society-wide, from a utility perspective...), we should be explicit about that too, and again things will change. You might want to have students study French, Greek, Latin, Lojban, etc. for at least 2 years each because of Intellectualism -- but you may also want to balance that with more modern things like deeper computer science or math or physics, which won&#x27;t help most people in their future lives either but can at least be fun and intellectually interesting for people who want their Intellectualism a certain way. Or we can try for a mix, but I&#x27;d propose that our current system is a mix, and other mixes will inevitably resemble the current system by being one-size-fits-all and not work too well. So if we want both, separate. Bring back trade schools and let young teenagers wholly uninterested in purely intellectual pursuits get to doing more interesting things like building a house or building JavaEE applications, and let the intellectuals do their thing without constantly having to waste time and energy rationalizing some vague utility and relevance to their proof-carrying code research.",1432956231

That&#x27;s a pretty strong guarantee. That&#x27;s a strong type. When in a C program do you enjoy the guarantee that something you are manipulating will always for sure be a certain way no matter what? CPU designers enjoy that guarantee towards registers, program counters, caches, and all the &quot;state&quot; you defend to be so alike that of C. There&#x27;s a set number of registers and it never changes throughout execution. There&#x27;s a set number of bits in RAM and it never changes throughout execution. Whether these bits over here and those over there are 0s or 1s are immaterial to the CPU because guess what, the CPU does not care, it does not understand the semantics of my program, and so it can never take a &quot;wrong&quot; step - any &quot;error&quot; is my fault for coding the wrong instructions. (Except for the occasional CPU bug as I have been shown exist).<p>Please stop trying to talk about assembly. I know assembly. I&#x27;ve programmed Win32 assembly (you can make fun of me, it&#x27;s fine). I&#x27;m not talking about assembly here. I&#x27;m talking about the CPU designers or programmers and the guarantees they have when programming that we rarely do in HLLs.<p>Think of this another way: say you are designing/coding a CPU. Isn&#x27;t every possible error that can happen your fault? Is that the case in C? Whose fault is it if the computer runs out of memory? If memory gets corrupted? If a hacker pokes your memory to cheat in a game? It&#x27;s no one&#x27;s fault, those things can&#x27;t be predicted. But when designing a CPU you can be sure you have the power to predict every possible thing that can happen in your problem domain. Because you&#x27;re designing a dataflow grid and an adjunct list of booleans whose semantics are immaterial to you. But in C it&#x27;s just not possible (nor in any other language, C is just a stand-in here) because you are invested in the semantics.",1432955451

I&#x27;ve only read a handful of books in Esperanto so far, but it has been an excellent way to read first-hand accounts of people writing about their own cultures and experiences.<p>Last night I finished reading <i>Vikitmoj</i> (Victims) by Julio Baghy.  The book is a semi-autobiographical story of the author&#x27;s experiences in a Siberian prisoner of war camp after WWI.  It&#x27;s a fascinating glimpse into life in these camps and how the different populations (POWs, soldiers, peasants, Jews, bolsheviks, etc.) all interacted with each other.  As an example, one practice Baghy writes of is a kind of &quot;duel&quot; that the POWs would sometimes engage in between each other.  (In the book it came out that one of the POWs had been sleeping with the wife of another of the POWs back before they had been captured.)  They weren&#x27;t allowed weapons, so they had to be a little creative.  They would draw lots and the loser would have to provoke the soldiers on one of their marches so that the soldiers would beat him (sometimes to death).<p>If you learn any national language, you&#x27;ll be able to read people in a handful of cultures write about themselves in their own words.  But one of the unique features of Esperanto is that after you learn it, you can read the works of people in cultures all across the globe without the need of a translator as intermediary.  (Of course the subset of people in a culture who write in Esperanto is not representative of the general population, but it&#x27;s better than nothing!)  In particular, many of these works haven&#x27;t been translated into English (or any other language for that matter), so you would have no way to read them otherwise anyway!",1432955165

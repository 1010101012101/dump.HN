I don't regret it because I've kept up the self-learning (being an ACM member, reading lots of papers on a continual basis, not budgeting books on CS and engineering).<p>I think you can afford to drop out of college, but you cannot afford to drop out of learning. I've seen too many senior engineers wind up sidelined because they concentrated on just what they were good at in their job.<p>I don't mean be a butterfly, or attempt to learn every month's new cool stuff. But get exposure to lots of levels of many good systems. Read the Unix source code. Read a compiler or two. Learn Prolog or Haskell. Write a network stack. Learn about database implementation, and Self, and modern graphics, and build systems. Learn everything you can from the stuff around you that is of good quality.<p>I'm earning more money than I would have believed possible, at a job I think I would do for free, if I could.

2927163,comment,2927062,2927155,20,0,diogenescynic,,,"Francis Ford Coppola:<p>Q: How does an aspiring artist bridge the gap between distribution and commerce?<p>A: We have to be very clever about those things. You have to remember that it's only a few hundred years, if that much, that artists are working with money. Artists never got money. Artists had a patron, either the leader of the state or the duke of Weimar or somewhere, or the church, the pope. Or they had another job. I have another job. I make films. No one tells me what to do. But I make the money in the wine industry. You work another job and get up at five in the morning and write your script.
This idea of Metallica or some rock n' roll singer being rich, that's not necessarily going to happen anymore. Because, as we enter into a new age, maybe art will be free. Maybe the students are right. They should be able to download music and movies. I'm going to be shot for saying this. But who said art has to cost money? And therefore, who says artists have to make money?<p>In the old days, 200 years ago, if you were a composer, the only way you could make money was to travel with the orchestra and be the conductor, because then you'd be paid as a musician. There was no recording. There were no record royalties. So I would say, ""Try to disconnect the idea of cinema with the idea of making a living and money."" Because there are ways around it.<p><a href=""http://the99percent.com/articles/6973/Francis-Ford-Coppola-O.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://the99percent.com/articles/6973/Francis-Ford-Coppola-O...</a>.",1314326837

I am the cofounder of a start-up that is just starting to gain quite a bit of momentumall the hard work is finally starting to pay off. Our business involves sending payments via check to people, and we use Schwab to handle that side of the business.
This morning, I opened the bank account as usual to check the balance, only to get with this message: 'This account is now closed. If you feel this account was closed in error, please contact customer service at 800-435-4000.' We have tens of thousands of dollars of checks outstanding (this is usual), and an account closure would mean that anyone trying to cash a check would get a message saying the check had bounced along with a 'check bounced fee'.<p>To minimize the damage, I immediately got on the phone and started talking with someone (person #1); she put me on hold for half an hour, and I finally got to talk to (person #2). Person #2 was nice, but told me she couldn't do anything to help me, except forward me to the Client Advocacy Department. That's where things went sour.<p>The man (person #3) I talked to in the Client Advocacy Department was extremely rude. Finally, I asked him a question, to which he replied, ""Well, your account is closed!"" and straight-up laughed at me. I said ""Is there someone I could speak with will try to help me instead of laughing at me?"" He said ""No, there isn't.""
At that point, I decided to visit my local Schwabit's right up the street. I got the same storywe can't reopen your account or tell you why it was closed or help you in any way. The best we can do is give you a lump-sum check for the value. Finally, person #3's manager called mesupposedly the highest-level person in Schwab you can talk to. He was extremely rudeeven just remaining silent for long periods of time when I was done talking.<p>Anyway, the rudeness/bad customer service is okay, because that's the first time I've experienced it. What's not okay is that this move on the part of Schwab to unilaterally shut down the account without reason (no one will tell me) is ultimately going to destroy our start-up (and any traction it has along with it) as well as make it hard for thousands of people to get money that is theirs.
So, HNers, what can I do? I'm extremely frustrated, and I feel like I'm out of options.",1314326317

And this comes back to something I know has been discussed at least a few times before. Essentially that many good sites started with a high Signal to Noise ratio. Then more folks found out about them, and they added more signal, but variety started to creep in, and what is signal to me may be noise to you, and vice versa. Which means that there may actually be MORE signal to noise now, but for the average user/reader there appears to be less because the signal they are interested in is diluted.<p>There have been a number of answers to this, and each of them can be found to have evolved essentially from UseNet News and various simple BBS and/or FidoNet BBS programs. Not a one of them is perfect (obviously or the discussion would be unnecessary).<p>I ""personally"" think the best answer is to have a site where the ""main"" board is run by a benevolent dictator, who also has to monitor other boards off the main board but has no similar moderation on those boards. Allows the main board to develop a personality that you can rely on, while insuring that differing views get their day in the sun, and allow for the growth of new moderators over time.<p>I used to run a C64 BBS and wrote and ran an Amiga BBS, and so have at least some experience to validate my opinion. I suppose if I'm serious about this being the answer I should be willing to set such a place up and see if people would actually like it. One person below mentioned a Metafilter $5 to ""subscribe"" to post model, but I'm not sure how that would work as a long term model - though I suspect I would prefer that to having something overrun with ads.<p>Anyway, there's my .02 cents. <- Actually that might be an answer worth looking into too. The postal service once looked at offering e-stamps to give you guaranteed delivery and some level of authentication per message.

However, using the application cache like the author suggests means that you will never have to download the specified content, like jQuery, again. Additionally, since you have 5MB of storage, I really don't think the <i>31KB</i> of jQuery really matters.<p>I agree that client-side rendering is not optimal, but for different reasons. This isn't 2006 anymore, phones are more powerful now. Unless I absolutely have to, I'm not going to care about your Nokia from back in the Stone Age. My problem with client-side rendering is that it chokes on large data-sets. You also have to pay the penalty to download the dynamic content <i>after</i> you download the static content, but this can be mitigated by only updating the content, rather than using AJAX to load it all to begin with. That also kills the author's use of the plug-in that stores AJAX data locally, but that's a separate issue.<p>My advice:
Use jQuery, jQuery Mobile, and AppCache. When combined, jQuery and jQuery Mobile (including CSS) take up 58KB of space. Oh, and since you're storing it all locally from now on, there's no need to cry about the time (less than 1s on 3g) it takes to download all those fancy JS files.",1314324973

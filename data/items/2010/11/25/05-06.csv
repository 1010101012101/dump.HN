Imagine that the TSA and its European counterparts didn't engage in pointless airline-security measures like banning liquids. And imagine that the press didn't write about it endlessly, and that the politicians didn't use the event to remind us all how scared we should be. If we'd reacted that way, then the terrorists would have truly failed.""<p>Yes, the terrorists would have failed.  Then they would exploit our continued lack of vigilance and try again and again until we were scared and started to crack down.  These arguments that we should not respond to terrorism are a bunch of lovey dove hopeful hogwash.  Terrorists aren't going to give up because we ignored their destructive acts.  They will keep blowing more shit up until they are dead or get the attention they seek.",1290661435

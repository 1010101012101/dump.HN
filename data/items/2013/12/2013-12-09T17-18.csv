It&#x27;s not really debatable that the current court is heavily pro-corporation/government power, though some blips against this trend can be observed, as you pointed out.<p>In terms of sources: <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/susie-madrak/elizabeth-warren-warns-corporate-capt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://crooksandliars.com/susie-madrak/elizabeth-warren-warn...</a> ; the quoted remarks by Senator Warren indicate that judicial nominees are actually not easily confirmed, and are sometimes already &quot;captured&quot; by corporate interest. It&#x27;s very feasible that lobbyists could lobby the legislature in order to promote confirmation of judicial candidates who fit their agenda.<p>Aside from lobbying the legislature to affect the judiciary&#x27;s appointments, the judiciary can also be directly bought and sold: <a href=\"http://jonathanturley.org/2013/06/02/its-all-about-the-judges/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jonathanturley.org/2013/06/02/its-all-about-the-judge...</a> ; most relevantly: “According to a recent investigation by the Center for Public Integrity, “conservative foundations, multinational oil companies and a prescription drug maker were the most frequent sponsors of more than 100 expense-paid educational seminars attended by federal judges over a 4 1/2-year period.” About 185 federal judges participated in these “educational” events which were sponsored by multinational corporations such as ExxonMobil, Pfizer and BP.&quot;<p>I do not accept that the corruption that I outlined is a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;-- it is a well-documented reality.",1386611999

6875599,comment,6874838,6875102,1,0,digz,,,"A service company (i.e., a law firm) being acquired would almost exclusively depend on goodwill for the accounting of the transaction.  There are few fixed assets beyond desks and chairs and possibly a property lease to include as assets.  Accounts receivable and cash would of course play a role, but that is likely a fraction of the overall value paid.  The difference between book value and the price paid is accounted for through book value.<p>Even in a steady-state in which Snapchat is earning serious money, were it to be acquired, the acquirer would likely need to account for it predominantly through goodwill.  What tangible assets does snapchat have?  Data center/infrastructure is likely the only area where a company like snapchat could invest in a way that would increase its book value... but snapchat is more likely to stay on the cloud...<p>The typical tech startup has few tangible assets, hence the necessity to account through book value.",1386611968

More so, the arrangement of &quot;bike lanes&quot; as well as the laws themselves typically make it very, very difficult for bikelrs to get from point A to point B without at some point either putting themselves in excessive danger or effectively violating the law.<p>Rule makers typically just assume that bikers can either safely blend themselves into normal vehicular traffic or teleport across gaps in properly laid out bike access areas (which tend to be rare and never fully connected with each other). It&#x27;s a ridiculous and unsafe situation that we&#x27;ve become accostomed to existing merely because it&#x27;s the status quo.

I am not a sexist nor do I discriminate, nor am I guilty of putting women down in any way, shape, or form, especially since before my time so I fail to see how the burden is on my shoulders, and why I should hire someone purely based on their genitalia. I am in no way responsible for what happened before my time.<p>The reality is both men and women suffer from different things, and it&#x27;s ill to make blanket assumptions based entirely on gender.<p>What if the male I&#x27;m hiring is less experienced, but extremely poor and almost homeless. What if the the woman I&#x27;m interviewing right after is stable, but a woman? How do I evaluate this case?<p>I think the best we should do is treat both equally, as that&#x27;s equality and we should all strive to eliminate discrimination amongst each other, not specifically and artificially target one demography that has been oppressed, because there are tons of other causes better suited for awareness than women. What about black people? I very rarely see black people in the tech sector. Maybe we should stop hiring asians and hire blacks instead to level out that inequality? Where does it stop?<p>Discrimination in the face of equality doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it is still discrimination, even if it in favour of hiring women. Someone will always end up getting hurt, it&#x27;s always a trade off.<p>I have loads of developer friends who are female and they have absolutely no problem getting hired, because they are GOOD. Just statistically, there are less women in this field.<p>Instead of sacrificing someone else&#x27;s opportunities in the name of purely gender, offer everyone the same opportunities.<p>What I do think needs to be done is have more communities focused on the STEM fields to make women feel more comfortable ENTERING it, not EXITING it, they&#x27;ve already committed to the field.<p>----<p>See my other post as well: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6875633\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6875633</a>",1386611807

And this data didn’t just include the place where someone had checked in. It showed how strong the GPS signal was at the time, how strong each surrounding Wi-Fi hotspot signal was, what local cell towers were nearby, and so on. Leveraging this data meant that Foursquare could still grab a good current location even if users were underground, near a source of radio interference, or facing some other signal obstacle. Chances are, some prior Foursquare user had seen the world through the same flawed eyes and reported his or her location.<p>This sounds more valuable as a technology than the social network side of the business itself.<p>If another company wanted to build up a similar database of location information, they could send out a fleet of its own staff all over the world to collect it, à la Google&#x27;s Street View cars. But Foursquare has managed to sidestep all of this expense and infrastructure by harnessing its userbase as a massive, free source of data input.<p>Through badges, recommendations, and deals with local stores, they&#x27;ve created an incentive to provide the data they need. And through the mechanisms they have to prevent cheating in the game side of things, they&#x27;ve accidentally developed a way to ensure the accuracy of the location information their system can provide.<p>Licensing out this technology could become the long-sought-after profit engine for Foursquare, paying the bills for the flashy social network layer on top that keeps the data flowing in.",1386610885

In such a world where this equilibrium exists, there is no need for &quot;ideology and affirmative action&quot; because any <i>affirmative</i> actions to create inequality will be erased through the passage of time as the world returns to the equilibrium of equality.<p>The problem with this attitude is that it is utterly unwarranted, unsubstantiated, and totally Panglossian. It is irrefutable that for generations American society took &quot;affirmative action&quot; to suppress women, to pigeonhole them into an impoverished gender role concerned only with housekeeping and child rearing. You don&#x27;t even have to go back that far to see this &quot;affirmative action&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.boredpanda.com/vintage-ads\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.boredpanda.com/vintage-ads</a>). Even if you believe that there is no continuing discrimination,[1] what on earth makes you believe that past discrimination will simply be erased through the history of time?<p>The solution to gender inequality issues is to simply hire women. Hire women and promote women. Once your organization and industry isn&#x27;t perceived as male-dominated, once qualified and ambitious women don&#x27;t turn away from the field to pursue others where being a woman is less likely to be a career liability,[2] the qualified applications will materialize.<p>One of the greatest success stories of gender equality is, in my opinion, are professional services firms, law in particular but also accounting and consulting. The legal industry went from 95%+ male in the 1950&#x27;s and 1960&#x27;s to almost even today, even at large corporate law firms. While tech companies are scratching their heads trying to figure out how to get <i>any</i> women in the door, law firms are under fire because &quot;only&quot; 1/3 of new partners each year are women. &quot;Only&quot; 15% of Big 4 accounting firm partners are women and its a source of constant consternation for women.[3] While any discussion of trying to get women into tech is clouded by the specter of &quot;affirmative action&quot; law firms, at least at the lower levels, no longer even need to take explicit steps to recruit equal numbers of women. Professional services firms are proof that when you hire women and promote women, equalized gender ratios become self-perpetuating. There are still major challenges faced by women today in the professional services industry, but these firms are operating in a whole different century than the tech sector.<p>[1] Which is itself a ridiculous belief in the face of studies proving that older men are, say, less likely to mentor younger women than younger men, and that employers tend to treat similar resumes with male versus female names differently.<p>[2] Who wants to, as a woman, invest themselves in a career in tech when there is a decent chance your boss will be this guy: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6875311\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6875311</a> (&quot;there are differences in the way men and women think, with men more naturally drawn to STEM fields...&quot;)<p>[3] At what tech company are the most senior engineering roles even 15% women? Marissa Mayer estimated about 15-17% for women engineers in Silicon Valley across the board. For comparison, Big 4 accounting firms are 45-50% women across the board, with 15-20% at the partner level.",1386610863

Feminists are glad to let men do all the low-status shit jobs, like garbage collection or construction or working in oil fields, as long as such work remains low-status. 20 years ago, programming was low status and women were obsessed with becoming doctors and lawyers because medicine and law were very high status. 20 years from now there will be lots of women programmers just like there are lots of women doctors and lawyers today.",1386610640

They want to be the &#x27;cool kids&#x27; to the people who &#x27;pick winners.&#x27; That keeps the money coming in and the partners paid. Because of that, being an investor in a company that makes a positive, splashy, exit (not necessarily really profitable) helps keep that brand alive.<p>Given that, when there are already acquisition offers being turned down, VCs no doubt see an opportunity to buff their brand by having a piece of the action. And a weird feedback loop is that founders are quite flattered to hear their company referred to with such high valuations, and it might make their personal fortunes seem large (since they generally still have a large chunk of stock) even though an exit that doesn&#x27;t clear the preference hurdle will typically pay them little.<p>So we get this little dance.<p>Such dreams don&#x27;t always work out of course.

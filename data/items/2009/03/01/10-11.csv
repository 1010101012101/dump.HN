Node A and node A' sync their updates via an update log and can fail at any time and come back at any time without taking down the system.<p>Additionally, if high availability is really a big issue, then a node A''' can be introduced that can be in another data center.<p>If you add nodes to the storage ring, then some of the existing keys will be invalidated. To solve this issue and the issue of routing a lookup ring is created. Lookup ring holds a pair (key, storage_ring_location). The system will automatically update (key, storage_ring_location) if it's at some point invalidated (such as that key does not point to node A, but node D).<p>I have tried to find an easy solution for a rather complex problem. Keeping membership state, doing Paxos and keeping routing tables would have been much more time consuming to make - so I have tried to solve the problem from another angel (by using master-master replication for high availability).",1235904905

When the movies suck, people don't go to the movies.<p>Paul Blart is a pretty good movie. It's light hearted fun - perfect kost for a movie. Heavy stuff is easier to read than to watch - movies move at their own pace, and it's not possible to pack so much heavy stuff into movies.<p>The movie makers are learning to make what Americans want, and they are being rewarded for it.",1235903380

As I understand it, the OP is looking for something that will sync while already serving up the file, presumably giving priority to syncing the parts that are already being requested by clients. (which will be the beginning of the file most of the time unless clients will be using partial downloading)<p>I've never set one up myself, but a clustering file system might work, e.g. OCFS: <a href=""http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2/</a>",1235902475

Depressions are rather defined by sorrier things: Selling hard assets for food, becoming migrant workers for food, surrendering morals for food, etc.<p>Modern efficiency being what it is, real depressions are probably impossible.

It is either really cold or really hot. It is nothing like the Bay Area's year round temperate weather.<p>During the fall and winter, Atlanta is typically gloomy and overcast almost every day. It's cold enough to ice too... I still remember feeling stupid for not wearing ear muffs or a hood walking across Tech's campus; it felt like my ears were going to fall off. Gloves are good idea too unless you want your hands goin dead.<p>During the spring and summer, it is very sunny but it is also really hot. Though not as bad as Florida, there are days where you can just walk for a 1/2 hour outside and be drenched in sweat. Air conditioning is a must, and your electric bill will reflect that.",1235901637

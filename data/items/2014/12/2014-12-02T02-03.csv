8685283,comment,8682996,8685065,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"WebRTC is sort of a hack up of SIP-similar technologies, and is definitely VoIP.<p>SIP and SDP are also clusterfucks of protocols with some really, really, terrible design decisions. (Hey, let&#x27;s specify UDP _AND_ TCP, and require clients to flip between transport on a per-message level! Why not? It&#x27;s easy to spec idiotic stuff on paper...)<p>Anyways, SIP does not NAT well as it assumes, like it&#x27;s the 1980s, that you are on a public IP and can directly send to any port on anyone&#x27;s public IP. Then it goes and embeds your IP all over the place, because they were too cool for simple symmetric pipes. To make it more fun, all sorts of firewall and router vendors try to &quot;fix&quot; SIP and generally just screw things up even more.<p>As I understand, a lot of WebRTC effort went into dealing with NAT and some other niceties. (And apparently, arguing about codecs.) Otherwise, you&#x27;re right, there&#x27;s not a whole lot to be done. Despite the terribleness of SIP, it generally works, and VoIP engineers have figured out how to make it work pretty well.<p>However, it&#x27;s unlikely that re-using parts of SIP/SDP in WebRTC makes _any_ difference in adoption of things. Almost no one runs SIP openly, they lock it down like a traditional telephony system. Best is in fact to firewall it off, because you&#x27;re rather naive if you trust all this C/C++ code parsing strings like mad. Plus, since SIP systems are often connected to other telephone networks with billing, even protocol-level hackery can lead to a lot of financial loss.<p>So in short, it&#x27;d be super duper unlikely you&#x27;d ever be able to point your web browser at &quot;sip:someone@somebusiness.com&quot;, even if it had SIP built-in.",1417485731

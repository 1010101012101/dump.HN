The iOS browser, on the other hand, crashed 3 times in my first day with an Apple device.<p>But the primary reason I use Android is that it has features iOS doesn't; proper cross-app integration with intents, a replaceable launcher, a user accessible file system and best of all, I never have to deal with iTunes. I absolutely loathe iTunes.<p>I've never had problems with fragmentation (probably helps that I run Nexus devices - I've had more issues running older iOS on iPod Touches that hadn't been upgraded owing to upgrade fees); and I find UI more consistent - or at least did, before the menu button was deprecated (I happen to like menus for their discoverability). The back button is awesome. It's been some time since I was in the Apple app ecosystem, but I still don't think they let you have things like AIDE, Tasker or Locale.<p>I do think iOS devices have higher frame rates, fewer dropped frames and lower touch latency. ICS recent apps button latency is a joke - nearly a second on my galaxy nexus at times. The iOS text selection mechanism is better. And having switched from HTC to Samsung, I'm not impressed with the hardware (though the margin between iPhone 4 screen and Galaxy Nexus screen is quite small).

They'd drive each bridge over the bridge they had just put in place basically building their way as they went.

It's often hard to predict how important those things will be.  And all people had seen at that point was a demo from Steve Jobs.<p>But what the market research really failed to predict was that average consumers would start dumping their carriers and switch to AT&T just to get their hands on this new iPhone.  That led virtually all other major carriers to jump through whatever hoops necessary to get the iPhone on their networks to avoid being left out in the cold.  And the rest is history.<p>In an industry where it's the manufacturers who have to jump through all the hoops to get support from the carriers, this role reversal between Apple and carriers turned the industry on its head.  Nobody would have predicted that in January 2007.",1334730322

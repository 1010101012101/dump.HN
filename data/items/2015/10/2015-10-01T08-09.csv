If the orgasm were internal, it&#x27;d be hard to miss (though there&#x27;s an entire niche for that, of course). As to why it&#x27;s the face in particular: it&#x27;s the easiest way to directly show the recipient&#x27;s reaction at the same time, especially on low-resolution or small-scale displays (plus on those devices a close-up tends to be easier to recognize).<p>The psychological explanation has something to do with there being a long-standing trope of portraying cannibalism as the ultimate infatuation (e.g. the communion of the Holy Spirit in Christianity representing &quot;becoming one with Jesus&quot; by consuming his flesh and blood) and ejaculate representing the &quot;essence&quot; of the male orgasm (biologically speaking the entire &quot;point&quot; of sex is to put one person&#x27;s sperm in the other person&#x27;s body).<p>It may seem odd that there are people who are into the ejaculate itself but it&#x27;s far more straightforward than a lot of other things some people enjoy (including pretty much everything else that can come out of a person&#x27;s body, apparently non-sexual body parts and things that aren&#x27;t even related to persons, or even BDSM which is so much about psychology it can get away without any actual intercourse taking place).",1443688664

A continuant in a consonantal position is a consonant.  We see this in the opposite direction in English with word-initial &#x27;w&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27;, both are continuants that make a sound that could, in a vocalic position, likely be represented by one or more of the aforementioned vowels of the Roman alphabet.<p>Non-continuants cannot occupy vowel positions, and there are no examples of this in the article.<p>Even where, orthographically, a syllable is represented by a grapheme typically considered to represent a stop consonant (e.g. k in Slovak), this will normally represent the consonant and an unwritten vowel (e.g. a following schwa).",1443688323

People need to be able to find it by URL, cite it, and refer to it with an ID. The URL is no good because it could change. If you cite a URL and it 404s in a few years time, that&#x27;s link rot.<p>So a DOI is a link that points to the item. It &#x27;belongs&#x27; to the publisher who owns the article. They are obliged to update the link to point to the new location when it moves. Hence the DOI link always (in theory) works.<p>From a user&#x27;s perspective, a DOI is just a URL that you visit that redirects you to a different URL. From inside, it&#x27;s a link resolver system backed by a database that publishers keep updated through a registration agency (e.g. Crossref).<p>Different Registration Agencies do different things.

I last played on September 20 and made $51.02 per hour. My friends have encouraged me to write about my experiences onto Hacker News, but I never have.<p>You learn a lot about people and crowd dynamics. Donations come in clusters; if a person sees someone else donate, he/she is more likely to. In an attempt to teach empathy, mothers often give cash to their three-year old kid to put in the violin case. The few who drop a $10 or $20 are often over 40 years old.<p>Twice I&#x27;ve had money stolen, both by dudes in their late teens or early twenties.<p>Sound definitely matters; you can&#x27;t just &quot;look good&quot;. Busking at the Ferry Building was a bad idea; no one can hear you. I&#x27;ll never do that again.<p>High-density foot traffic is not always a good thing. In the evening rush hour, there are so many people obstructing view and making noise that I imagine it&#x27;s difficult to appreciate the music by the time you&#x27;ve reached the fare gates. I believe that a medium traffic density works best where the sound can travel and there is always a direct line of sight between pedestrian and performer.<p>Sometimes the &quot;great works&quot; make poor busking choices. The Bach Chaconne is a great example.<p>Unsurprisingly, an ensemble with more performers earns more than a soloist. On August 20, 2014, we played the Mendelssohn Octet in Powell Station and collectively made $461.64 over 90 minutes, or $307.76 per hour. However, that&#x27;s $38.47 per hour per person. I make $15-50 per hour solo. So I wonder where the diminishing returns begin, i.e. what ensemble size maximizes revenue per hour per person.<p>Is it scary? The scariest part was leaving the apartment that first day.  Exiting the apartment door was the point of no return. &quot;Okay, I have my jacket and shoes on and my violin, I might as well go on with it.&quot; That moment when, for the first time, alone, I plopped my music stand in the middle of Embarcadero Station was one of the most <i>uncomfortable</i> moments of my life. However, once you start playing, that&#x27;s easy. The music is the easy part.<p>If you want to busk but are scared, I recommend going at a less busy time, e.g. Saturday morning at 10 am. Get used to the surroundings; embrace your anxiety. Once you&#x27;re comfortable, try again next week at 2 pm.",1443686499

I believe Homebrew likes to have its path owned by you instead of root, so I think it makes more sense to have stuff that&#x27;s going to be owned by me to be in my home folder rather than /usr/local.",1443686400

That few being the intersection of those who rely on java applets for something they care about (already a tiny fraction) and those who lack the knowledge to solve the problem on their own (an even smaller fraction). Even losing that fraction of users is unlikely to affect firefox&#x27;s marketshare to any significant degree.<p>In the context of a company&#x27;s IT department, they should be competent enough to know how to set default browser configurations and to provide walk-through documentation. If an IT department thinks that user convenience is a good enough excuse to expose the company&#x27;s employees to some of the most serious and hard to prevent web-based exploits out there then I say fuck &#x27;em.

Then someone else changes that function to contain regex - s/he shouldn&#x27;t need to (and may not be able to) verify every single place where this function is used - introducing a hard to find bug.

But there are also a lot of cheap, readily available foods out there that are packed with sugar. Need to make a cheap tomato sauce tastier? Add a little HFCS. Doesn&#x27;t cost much, and makes it preferable to the next one.<p>I&#x27;m also constantly surprised at the number of people who drink soda on a daily basis. It&#x27;s carbonated sugar water, it&#x27;s terrible for you, but some people just can&#x27;t seem to stop drinking it. You wouldn&#x27;t think to claim that someone who drank two Cokes in a day was &quot;overeating&quot;, but that&#x27;s equivalent to eating an extra hamburger per day; if someone ordered another hamburger on top of their lunch, you&#x27;d think it a bit excessive.<p>Diet Soda doesn&#x27;t help as much as people think. It turns out that it still leaves you with a hell of a sweet tooth, and craving more sugar.<p>Then there are all of the food products out there that tout themselves as healthy options. Which one do you think is lower calorie, a burrito or a Caesar Salad? Well, it turns out due to all the glop they put in the dressing, a fairly loaded burrito with rice, beans, and sour cream can be lower calorie, lower saturated fat, and higher in fiber than a Caesar Salad.<p>So, there are a lot of things about modern diets that make it particularly prone to overeating. Between salty snacks that you compulsively eat, sugar levels in everything creeping up, food touted as healthy that&#x27;s anything but, and the like, coupled with (as you mention) overeating and a sedentary lifestyle, it&#x27;s no wonder people get fat.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that you shouldn&#x27;t be concerned about the HFCS. No, HFCS is not &quot;poison&quot; or &quot;toxic&quot;. But it is excessively cheap and overused. If you avoid HFCS (and aren&#x27;t stupid about it by simply substituting foods that have an equivalent amount of other sugars), you can avoid a lot of the foods that are bad for you that sort of sneak up on you.<p>I also blame a lot of this on the whole &quot;low fat&quot; fad. In efforts to reduce fat as much as possible, lots of food manufacturers looked to other things to enhance the flavor of their foods. Sugar is an easy way to do so.",1382436137

6310605,comment,6308652,6310102,0,0,asgard1024,,,"Ok, let me try to explain a bit better. The parent poster seems to say that women are somehow &quot;put off&quot; by nudity. That&#x27;s a perfectly valid hypothesis.<p>But then art (and I am talking primarily about art, not modelling) is a problem, which requires further explanation. Because artists seem to be, at least to me, totally obsessed with nudity (and I think sex, too, but feel free to disagree here). So why <i>that</i> attracts women, in droves in fact, if they are put off by it?<p>My answer is that the hypothesis is wrong. Females are not put off by computer scientists, that&#x27;s not the reason why they don&#x27;t do computer science. In particular, I doubt you would find CS people more sexist than other group of men, I actually believe they are mostly nicer (and also lot more honest about their views, which can strongly bias it).<p>The reason why women don&#x27;t do CS is they lack confidence and positive role models to do it. You can actually see the differentiation happening in high school, where no one really knows how it works on the workplace yet. And that&#x27;s where, or maybe even earlier, the problem needs to be addressed. It&#x27;s probably cultural and frankly, whether the cause is wrong beliefs of men or wrong beliefs of women is irrelevant for the solution (wrong here in the sense &quot;differing from reality&quot;).<p>Edit: You could argue (I think you do) that the cultural norms about nudity in art and computing should be different. I don&#x27;t disagree (in fact, they are, which makes it a moot point anyway). But then, isn&#x27;t this a case of someone projecting their own cultural norms to somebody else? Is that really a failure of some culture that it doesn&#x27;t respect your (rather arbitrary and harmless, compared to art) norms?",1378047577

6310598,comment,6309989,6309989,9,0,rcfox,,,"One thing the article doesn&#x27;t mention: getting a set of maximally visually distinct colours. The best algorithm I&#x27;m familiar with for this is to iteratively choose colours as far away as possible from each other in Lab space (while still being able to map into RGB). You can also make sure that the colours stand out against your background by pre-seeding the space with your background colour.<p>However, it&#x27;s not a fast algorithm. The more colours you choose, the slower each iteration gets, since you have to calculate the distances from a growing set of colours. Also, after ~10, the distinctness seems to drop off pretty quickly. Lastly, assuming you&#x27;re seeding with the same colours, you&#x27;ll always get the same result, so it&#x27;s really best to do the calculations once and then cache them.",1378047467

And we’re growing fast.<p>In just one week since its launch, over 1 million users installed Dots on Android. Dots was developed on iOS using the Objective-C cocos2d-iphone game engine.

One thing I&#x27;ve wondered about is why all five possibilities actually work.<p>As an example, consider the icosahedron.  You could imagine trying to build one as follows.  Take five equilateral triangles, and attach them together so that they meet at one vertex and the respective sides adjacent to the vertices are shared.  This gives you a sort of cap-like shape consisting of the five triangles.<p>How, attach more triangles to the cap as above.  This will create a strip of 10 triangles around the &quot;equator&quot;.<p>Then, keep adding more triangles.  This step will end up creating another cap at the bottom of the icosahedron.<p>The question is, why do things inevitably match up on the bottom if you fill things in this way?  You can do the same construction with 3, 4, or 5 triangles, 3 squares, or 3 pentagons, and in all cases things line up exactly to give you a complete polyhedron.",1378046018

Currently, yield on the 10-year is about 2.75% and US real effective exchange rate inflation is just over 3%.<p>Back in... 2003? I remember one bank offering credit cards with no annual fee and zero interest for the first year.  I got a credit card for $2,500, maxxed it out on tax-deductible charity donations I was going to make anyway, paid it off a year later, and never touched the card again.  One friend told me there was a loophole in the bank&#x27;s promotion for rolling debt from another credit card, where you could for free turn that credit limit into a one year interest-free personal loan.  Depending on one&#x27;s risk appetite, one would then either buy US treasuries, 6 month CDs, or some high grade commercial paper.  As long as one had enough savings to easily stomach a $2,500 loss if things went sour, it was perfectly rational to max out one of these credit cards for an arbitrage opportunity of about 200 bps. (* This should not be construed as investment advice or solicitation for any investment.)  Then again, that&#x27;s a fair amount of work for a free $50.<p>Now, it seems the US government doesn&#x27;t have a plan for dealing with this debt if the world stops charging the US insanely low interest rates on its debt.  That&#x27;s irresponsible spending.<p>Debt isn&#x27;t the problem.  The problem is the lack of a good plan to reduce debt when the world stops paying the US 25 bps for the privilege of holding US debt.",1378045494

The leverage &quot;threaten to resign&quot; only works once; if you don&#x27;t follow through it won&#x27;t be credible again; and it marks you as having one foot out the door, making it less appealing to invest in training you or give you new responsibilities.<p>3. Even if you use leverage other than threatening to resign, moving jobs is guaranteed to get you away from your toxic boss, whereas trying to fix things isn&#x27;t guaranteed to work. And at the same time you can probably learn some new technologies and get a salary bump. Once you&#x27;ve got another job lined up, you might as well take it.<p>4.

As with many public issues, if the state administers the program, the result will likely be a catastrophe. The evidence? The outcome for prior programs of this kind.<p>Warren Buffett has recently argued that he and other very wealthy people should pay more in taxes, a sentiment many other wealthy people share:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/opinion/buffett-a-minimum-tax-for-the-wealthy.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/opinion/buffett-a-minimum-...</a><p>Quote: &quot;... we need Congress, right now, to enact a minimum tax on high incomes.

Each individual developer may have their own, but some reasons are common among some (if not most) developers:<p>> *   Having complete control over the machine. When developing an application or other userspace program, the developer has to take the code written by others into consideration: the operating system, the libraries, other programs, etc. It is a powerful feeling for the only code to be running on a machine to be your own.<p>> *   Research. Quite a few operating system projects are started as homework or research projects. While starting an operating system as a homework assignment in a pre-tertiary or first-year environment is generally considered a bad idea (due to short deadlines), a long-term project is quite fine. Research projects are usually undertaken to improve on existing operating systems. A common beginner mistake, however, is to underestimate the time needed to write an operating system from scratch.<p>> *   To replace the currently available operating systems. Maybe they don&#x27;t have a particular feature that the developer wants. Maybe they just generally suck (Linux is bloated, Windows is unstable, etc). This may be for profit; although any returns are likely to be a long time away.<p>> *   Because it&#x27;s fun. Low level programming is a fun and exciting task, because you have to do everything. This may seem more difficult (it is, don&#x27;t worry) but by the same reasons more fun. You know how everything works, how it all fits, and the inner-most workings of your program.<p>If nothing else, building your own operating system teaches you a lot about the internals of the magic suite of programs that run on your machine and makes them less mystical. Nothing compares to writing your own syscall or scheduler, and I certainly have learnt far more from my experiments than I would have if I had simply read Linux source code.",1378045371

Three minor issues:<p>1) Both this article and reference #3 make claims about not using or needing adders to avoid self modifying code, although both implement indexed addressing where you take a base address and a offset and er... um... argh... ADD them together.  So you&#x27;re using an adder but playing word games.  Only reference #2 actually &quot;does it&quot; without an adder.  If you&#x27;re doing it for &quot;fun&quot; then self modifying code is plenty of &quot;fun&quot;.<p>2) The claim the compiler is going to be the icky part is not accurate.  To a crude approximation a compiler would do something about as hard as a FPGA synth of a microcode decoder for a soft CPU.  Not as simple as implementing a HTML BLINK tag but its just no big deal breaker.  The icky part is going to be performance.  Just adding a little cache isn&#x27;t going to help if your code stalls it inherently and you&#x27;re going to be pretty well memory starved.  Good luck doing a fast floating point multiply-add for a DSP with this architecture.<p>3) A minor issue but it should be possible to get instantaneous power very low with this design.  No one writes about this interesting issue (unless its in reference 3 which I don&#x27;t have access to)  Of course &quot;power per FLOP&quot; type of metrics are (Probably?  Inevitably?) going to suck, unless I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I&#x27;ve done a lot of daydreaming about actually implementing a system outta reference #1 for fun.  Its about the simplest hardware &quot;processor&quot; you can possibly build.  After all, you&#x27;re going to need (memory mapped) I/O anyway and who cares if one of the memory mapped I/O is a 32 bit wide full adder, or whatever other CPU-like functional module you&#x27;d like to entertain.  I have two amusing daydreams, one is a 256 bit wide move machine (why 256 bits wide?  Why the heck not?  Difficult, but barely inside the limit of buildability) the other strange daydream is vaguely like an old IBM1620 but why not try floating point instead of BCD?  Yes I&#x27;m no noob I know all about floating point rounding issues and I consider it a huge part of the &quot;fun&quot;.  Also I&#x27;m well aware a binary adder would be a wee bit quicker for the program counter than a floating point adder... that&#x27;s the whole point I think a pure float machine would be hilarious fun.  I&#x27;m not talking about merely sticking a floating point copro on a chip, but literally using IEEE 754 on the address bus (obviously with a bit of rounding)  Quad precision floating point should be enough digits for an address bus to have a heck of a lot of fun with some slack for rounding issues.",1378044952

Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun. In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one and the rest applies for the hassle-free Blue Card.<p>5. Berlin&#x27;s night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.<p>Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe.

How many Linux users are there, vs. how many developers contributed source to the Linux project? Only a tiny, tiniest fragment of the world developer population actually got off their butts and did something for Linux, and the rest of the world sat by and &quot;leeched&quot; off their work. And yet, Linux thrives. My argument is that we still don&#x27;t have real data about how many people in % need to be productive for the society to be sustainable and progressive.

Some of those people might turn to crime to get their jollies. I&#x27;m not sure there is any social system that can prevent this.<p>A guaranteed income that paid a basic subsistence would drive up the cost of goods. Some of that would be because people at the lowest end of the wage scale can now be picky about their working conditions, driving up the cost of delivering goods and services, and generally improving working conditions. Employers would have to make mundane, dirty, low-skill work a more palatable proposition. Garbage men&#x27;s wages would increase. Some of it would be because of opportunistic business practices seeking to maximize profit from goods and services and especially off of the people at the bottom. An equilibrium could be reached, but prices for goods and services wouldn&#x27;t look like the do now.<p>Why some action is necessary:<p>Whether you like the Basic Income or not, something has to change. Technology, especially automation, is currently and will continue to displace low-skilled labor. At some point it will also begin to eat some skilled labor. And why shouldn&#x27;t it? I can&#x27;t blame industry for automating labor away. I also can&#x27;t blame them for the effect that will have on the displaced labor; but, it <i>will</i> have a terrible effect if nothing is done. Nobody can expect those people to starve themselves. This is actually a great opportunity for humanity; if this &#x27;surplus&#x27; labor can be directed toward further advancing society (in a positive way).<p>What are the alternatives?<p>A fragmentation of society into: Aristocracy, Worker Class, and a Loafer Class.

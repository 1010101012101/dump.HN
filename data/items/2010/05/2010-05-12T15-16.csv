They manipulate as a means to an end, thinking themselves justified.<p>Unfortunately, everyone is using the same means (i.e. manipulation) leading to some pretty weird systems. Most politicians then fall victim to pursuing their ends relentlessly, even if the landscape has changed so much that an unbiased observer could see it is no longer of value.<p>To be fair, this happens to most ambitious people at some point.

I talked to someone at a lean startup meetup who was proud to have pivoted six times in under six months.  It sounded to me that they were looking for Twitter or Facebook-like growth in one of those ideas and, not finding it within a matter of days or weeks, moved on.  I told them that if we had pivoted that many times in our first six months, we wouldn't have survived a year.  In hindsight we maybe pivoted once in our first year, once in our third year, and now we're in year six.<p>Part of the problem is the word itself.  ""Pivot"" has a certain lightness, like dance -- just pivot!  There, you're off!<p>My mental picture of a pivot is turning a column of tanks in the middle of the desert.  Your tanks are hauling at full speed to an objective just over the horizon.  They're going to mow down anything in the way.  New intelligence comes in, is duly considered, found to be accurate, and on command your tanks hang a left to the new objective.  Their commitment to reaching the new objective is unwavering.<p>It wasn't hard to make the turn.  Radio in the order and they're off.  But you better be careful not to ask that column of tanks to go there -- wait, no, over there -- wait, back to the first place -- wait, just stay still for a little while while we figure things out.<p>Go ahead and pivot.  Do so when customer feedback, hard data, and your gut tell you this path is right and the previous path was wrong.  But know that you only get so many chances to pivot before you die in the desert.",1273679588

I participated in Paris Startup Weekend last december. It was amazing, I met very interesting and competent people that I still see today. And best of all I actually built a startup: <a href=""http://www.submate.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.submate.com</a> we just launched the MVP 2weeks ago and it's a tremendous experience.
I can assure you that we are now a real startup ! We have been selected at Plugg, The Next Web and Nonick and we are actually raising a seed round.<p>Startup Weekend is great !! And even better if you understand that everything actually start the next monday morning...<p>(in my experience, there were more marketing/biz guy than dev and very few designers)",1273676835

1341100,comment,1341097,1341097,0,0,nrj,,,"Hello HN,<p>In my limited spare time I have been working on a small side project, it is an application for Mac OS X called OneWay. To sum it up, it is a contextual FTP, SFTP uploader (upload only) that integrates into the Finder's Context Menu. It allows you to upload any files and folders in your Finder simply by selecting them and right-clicking. You can also easily add frequently used locations to your context menu for future use! <i>And You don't even need the application open!</i><p>Basically my goal was to create the easiest possible uploading solution that is light-weight and doesn't require me to open a Terminal. While applications like Cyberduck and Transmit are great, they really offer way more functionality than I need. I found that 90% of the time when I use FTP/SFTP I am only uploading, and secondly I find that I am often uploading to the same places (host, directory).<p>Of course, there are bugs... But how will I find them if I don't push it out the door already! With that said here are some helpful things to keep in mind.<p>#10.5 (Leopard) Users#<p>Unfortunately there are a few known issues for you. Firstly, it is out of my control but your contextual menu items will be added to your Finder under the ""More -> OneWay"" menu. If you do NOT see them there at all for some reason, please try restarting your Finder. You can do this by opening a Terminal, and typing `killall Finder`.<p>#10.6 (Snow Leopard) Users#<p>Your contextual menu items will live in the top level of your Finder menu! Though please note that in order to SEE the menu items you MUST have at least 1 file or folder selected. Also note, that if you add enough menu items, OSX will group them all under the ""Services"" menu instead of in the top level.<p>Thanks for checking out my app guys. Please post any feedback or bugs that you find.<p>Nick",1273676565

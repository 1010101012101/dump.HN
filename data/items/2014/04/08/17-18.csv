There are two general categories of solutions to this problem: technical increments (ie. a better constant factor), and fundamental cryptographic upgrades (eg. the stacktrace challenge-response concept we have been talking about on our blog). The first category we are not yet doing because we are following the well established advice of &quot;don&#x27;t prematurely optimize&quot;. The second category, well, that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re thinking of ideas like distributed blockchain storage, clever algorithms to force more people to be full nodes, and challenge-response protocols. There is also another idea I was thinking of, which I&#x27;ll have a post up over the next week or two.<p>In the long term, we are already beginning the development of a very widespread collaboration with academic groups to try to tackle the problems in cryptocurrency, and at this point we fully expect we&#x27;ll end up releasing Ethereum 2 at some point in 2016 which would take a lot of new cryptography into account.",1396979756

Every modern language, including C, restricts itself in some way in order to make programs more predictable and errors less likely. Some simply impose more restrictions than others, though these restrictions can actually make programs <i>more</i> efficient (see, for instance, alias analysis in Fortran vs. alias analysis in C).<p><pre><code>  > somebody has to deal with the pointers and raw memory \n  > because that&#x27;s the way computers work\n</code></pre>\nAll three of the languages listed previously (Rust, Ada, ATS) are systems programming languages with the capability of manipulating pointers and raw memory (though I don&#x27;t personally have any experience with the latter two). What they have in common is that they provide compile-time guarantees that certain aspects of your code are correct: for example, the guarantee that you never attempt to access freed memory. These are static checks that require no runtime to perform, and impose no overhead on running code.",1396979672

The article reports, &quot;But patients shouldn&#x27;t expect that the stimulator will help them walk -- at least not now and maybe not ever. The stimulator can only make one leg work at a time. Patients have to turn the stimulator off and then back on again to make the other leg work or to make another set of muscles such as their torsos work.&quot; That sounds like a rather significant practical limitation, so far. My dad had contemporary (2002-2008) physical therapy and other treatment, including electrical stimulation, after his injury, but he died having never walked and never scratched himself in the years after his injury.<p>I&#x27;m trying to find scientific publications about this now that I&#x27;ve read through the article. I see from 2011 the article &quot;Effect of epidural stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord on voluntary movement, standing, and assisted stepping after motor complete paraplegia: a case study&quot; The Lancet, Volume 377, Issue 9781, Pages 1938 - 1947, 4 June 2011 by  Susan Harkema (the doctor quoted in the news story) and several colleagues.<p>doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60547-3<p><a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60547-3/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-67...</a><p>The spinal cord injury reported in that single-patient case study was between the seventh cervical vertebra and first thoracic vertebra,[1] and that location further down from the brain makes for a more favorable prognosis than the second cervical vertebra injury my dad had. Those injuries can be quite devastating, and there are a lot of active research programs on how to treat them.<p>Spinal cord injuries vary in their severity according to where along the spinal cord the injury occurs and how severe the injury is. (A severed spinal cord is a rare outcome of most commonplace injuries, but there is so far no prospect of healing a severed spinal cord. The patient reported here, and my dad, had bruised but not severed spinal cords.) I imagine quite a few doctors at research hospitals are already attempting to reproduce the results reported by Dr. Harkema&#x27;s team. I hope they enjoy much success.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury</a><p>AFTER EDIT: The link to the current publication<p><a href=""http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/04/07/brain.awu038.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/04/07/bra...</a><p>kindly shared in another comment in this thread doesn&#x27;t seem to have a paywall for this article.

If you stimulate the correct nerves, you can have the correct muscles pull and create Ex. a fist, or a clenching motion. Implants right now don&#x27;t do a ton more then a simple &#x27;open-close&#x27; type motion for a hand (Since the intent is not so you can type on a computer, but so you can eat by yourself or pick-up a glass, etc.)",1396978254

Stimulation may have then allowed weaker signals to make it all the way though. This is definitely a big deal, but it won&#x27;t work for every patient. One of the biggest challenges in the area of brain-controlled movement is that brains are so unique to everybody, and stimulating the spinal-cord directly is hard to do without accidentally stimulating other parts of the body (In general, stimulators are past the spinal cord and closer to the appendage they&#x27;re going to move. Implants for the hand are usually located in the shoulder, and stimulate the nerve going off of the spinal-cord for example). If someone has a completely severed spinal cord, this technique won&#x27;t make a bridge for the signal so it&#x27;s not going to be a fix-all type of thing (Though, I&#x27;d be happy to be wrong!).",1396978248

PGP signing is a fairly standard mechanism by which somebody can prove that he packaged that software.<p>The interesting bit is ... if a web of trust can be established, this is far, far more secure than distributing binaries by HTTPS. That&#x27;s because the private keys with which those packages get signed DO NOT have to be distributed or installed on any public servers on this internet and thus this mechanism is invulnerable to exploits such as Heartbleed. And in the case of Linux distributions, this web of trust can easily be established, because the package maintainers and software authors know each other.<p>In the right context, the web of trust model can be much more secure than SSL/TLS, because SSL/TLS requires X.509 certificates that have to be issued by a central authority - and we&#x27;ll always have problems with central authorities that go rogue or have their root keys stolen. And you can&#x27;t rely on the central authority model if you want protection against the NSA. Too bad that PGP signing/encryption isn&#x27;t too popular, since the web of trust model only works if there are enough people vetting for each other.

Thus if you trust Packages you can verify the integrity of the .deb file.<p>Why should you trust the Packages file? Well, it&#x27;s checksums are listed in the Release file.<p>Why should you trust the Release file? Because there is a signature of it available in Release.gpg file. The signature is created by the distribution maintainers.<p>How can you trust this signature? Because your initial installation ISO, etc. came with the public key of the distribution maintainers which APT uses to verify all the packages. How can you trust the ISO you used to install it?

Typically you have  the following:<p>* Seed / angel funds. <$1M investment, 90-99% failure rate (failure rate is higher the less you invest). Astronomical returns because they buy equity when it is at its cheapest; a &quot;home run&quot; here can net you several thousand times your initial investment. Your founders are often very raw and you have to work with them on basic business fundamentals.<p>* Series A funds. ~$1-3M investment, 70-90% failure rate (though this is dropping as more funds move from Series A to seed funding.) Probably the riskiest of the bunch since you&#x27;re placing pretty big bets on a lot of companies; this is typically what people think of when they think &quot;VC&quot;. Returns for a &quot;home run&quot; are 10-100x initial investment. Your founders think they know what they&#x27;re doing but they don&#x27;t; good VCs will help the founders through their network and by letting them make enough mistakes to learn from.<p>* Growth funds. $10-25M investment, 50% failure rate. These guys go after companies that have proven a market exists and there&#x27;s an opportunity for huge growth if only they can scale. Still risky because scaling a business is hard. Returns for a &quot;home run&quot; are closer to 10x, but these guys can pull their funding if things are starting to circle the drain so a &quot;failure&quot; doesn&#x27;t always mean a loss. Good founders here are starting to realize they are in way over their head and ask their VCs for help.<p>* Pre-IPO funds. $25M+ investment, very low failure rate. Returns are relatively low but also much safer: investors here are basically funding you pending an inevitable IPO. This is basically your traditional private equity firms at this point. Founders here need guidance on how to take their company public (legal, cultural, etc.) -- hence why PE guys who are often ex-investment bankers play in this space.",1396976890

An employment or startup lawyer would be able to give you a good perspective on how such disputes actually play out in your state, as well as the probability of such a dispute. Since you say it has &#x27;nothing to do&#x27; with what your current employer does you&#x27;ll likely be OK; I would expect that after advising you a lawyer would then offer to write to your employer&#x27;s legal department to explain your position and ask for their OK. This would be better than making a casual inquiry yourself because it would create a proper legal record of communication from the outset and avoid arguments about who said what later on if a dispute should arise. Many lawyers would give you a short consultation for free or for a minimal fee, since the potential income from business development later on would be much more valuable. If you&#x27;re not sure where to find a lawyer, call your state bar. If you&#x27;re in Silicon Valley then then there&#x27;s no shortage of them.<p>Don&#x27;t DIY and put it in your wife&#x27;s name; in the event that a dispute does arise that&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> the sort of thing that a plaintiff would point to as a denial of honest services, and courts take a dim view of such legal &#x27;workarounds&#x27;. If you absolutely insist on DIY then do <i>everything</i> in writing, send emails from a personal rather than business email address etc. You can be circumspect (eg say you&#x27;d prefer not to say what your traffic is, should they ask) but don&#x27;t ever be dishonest - again, when a dispute arises the first person to lie is often the one that loses in the end.<p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer, and I repeat that you would be far better spending a few bucks getting a professional opinion than trying to wing it.",1396976700

It includes support for fairly advanced features like conditionals, scopes, and sub-configuration of 3rd party modules.  In some environments, for example, it may be quite sensible to include some bits of what might technically be considered &quot;business logic&quot; in something like URL rewrites.<p>Consider DNS records.  Not named.conf, but the actual zone data itself.  Is that configuration or is it data?  Do you check zone files into a configuration repository with your other files, or do you treat them more like a database to be modified on the fly and just back it up periodically?  It probably depends on how dynamic the records are expected to be.<p>Consider emacs: it uses lisp as its configuration language.<p>On the other end of the scale, you have very small single-purpose scripts that are easily hand-editable.  If you have a script that&#x27;s no more than 1K, maybe you simply put an &quot;options&quot; section at the top with some defaults that can be changed by modifying the code directly.  Or maybe your script is so small that even that amount of overhead is pointless.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that just because there is a grey area doesn&#x27;t mean that just because you might stuck there, everyone is.  But it doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be confusing sometimes.",1396976560

If you've come up with a neat technical trick, or had a bright spark of an idea, if you get too attached to it then you won't want to research it. There's this nagging fear at the back of your mind that if you do, you'll find that your glistening pearl of a retirement plan has been done to death by companies better positioned and funded than you can ever be, but you never heard about them because your bright idea wasn't on your home turf to begin with.<p>It's ironic, because finding that you have competition is one of the very best things that can happen to your idea: it forces it to morph and improve.",1297158712

2192426,comment,2191766,2191930,0,0,lsc,,,"Huh.  I had a government job in highschool;   I went to a poor school with a big 'occupational program'  where you get one or two periods off and some school credit to go to work, you know, to help the kids who are thinking of dropping out get a diploma.  It was pretty sad because there were mandatory class days where they showed you videos about how to be a better retail employee;   I can still tell you the steps they taught us to spot short-change scams and shoplifters.   It's sad because they could have just as easily spent some time talking about various trades one could learn by becoming an apprentice.  I had a job at the local computer repair shop the summer before[1]  where I obtained some contacts, so I became the IT guy for the local county health department.<p>It was a really great experience for me.   I was about 16, and I think 40 was pretty young for the office.  I don't know if I got much by way of mentoring as an IT guy (well, later on they hired another guy who was way better than I was and I did get some mentoring, but for most of the time I was there it was me and the office manager, who probably knew less than I did about most computer things)  but there was a lot of /very important/ social mentoring I got.     I learned how to (at least kind of) act like an adult, or at least how to interact with adults in a healthy manner.  On a social level, the semi-technical guy who hired me was one of the best people managers I've worked for.<p>I think it was an all around win/win;  I got treated like a human being (which feels /incredibly special/ to a high school kid.)  and I learned how to more productively deal with less-technical adults, and I got out of some school.  They got a reasonably skilled IT monkey for minimum wage.<p>After I got out of high school, of course, it was .com time, and I have not had reason to look back at government work since, just because I don't value stability that much and there's little chance I'd have the patience to wait it out long enough to get the pension.  I still look back somewhat fondly on my time working for the state.  (Or rather, the county.)<p>[1] my stepmother made me quit that job 'cause they had no workman's comp and I was being ""exploited"" for slightly under minimum wage.   I was 15!  it was far less dangerous than anything else a kid that age might reasonably do for fun, and they gave me discounts on used computer parts for the next three years, so I thought it was great.    Anyhow, it worked out okay, but it's another side to ""exploitation""",1297156174

""Aspirations to become a ""specific job title"" in order to propel myself in the professional career of software development.""<p>2) when writing points remember to answer the ""what"" the benefit was ex: ""Developed software for analyzing large sets of data""<p>- developed what type of software?
- analyzed what type of data?
- what was the benefit?<p>So your point could become: ""Developed an algorithm for the CS department which analyzed large sets of student record data in order to successfully predict student behavior""<p>3) remove this part: ""Various: Cashier, Stockboy, Waiter, Bartender, Valet""<p>You are telling HR that you like to work two jobs at once.
They only want you to be focused at one thing. Also this is not relevant to your profession thus it works against you.<p>4) Join a few meetup groups too, there are many free ones around your city. find them on meetup.com related to software development. Then include them in your resume replacing your interests section with it.<p>5) This line should be removed: ""I'm at home on the
command line and regularly write scripts or use crazy shell commands to automate work""<p>This whole section should be compiled into a chart consisting of languages, platforms, and OS thats it. 3 rows and two columns. (no fancy talk)<p>6) It seems you have took a portion of your cover letter and squeezed it under ""Expertise"" on your resume. This should be in your cover letter. (they are cool)<p>7) I would not use points which don't relate to programming such as: ""Fulfilled student and staff needs by working at my dormitory's front desk""<p>Think of working at a programming job which also got you to mop floors and wax shoes. Now when you apply for another job, you really wouldn't want to mention the violent mopping and aggressive shoe waxing, right? same thing. If you need points to replace those in your resume keep reading my points below.<p>8) I don't see any self management points such as estimations, work breakdown structures, checklists, tech release notes or even mention of process or best practices. Don't forget to mention these as you may have used some sort of deliverables or even sat with a manager to talk about the best way to proceed. Use it as best practice discussions and ongoing process improvement.<p>9) remove the work ""Hacker"". not every startup knows what this means. especially the HR rep who works at these startups. I'm in IT and it still pulls the word ""criminal"" in my mind.<p>10) also include some points on how you managed your career path within the organizations along with educational paths. Leverage the names of thought leaders in your specific industry.<p>other than that don't forget to expand on every related point as stated in #2.<p>Also don't forget to volunteer your programming efforts so that you can use some of it on your resume. join Odesk or Elance and get paid for small gigs. plus you can put these on your resume if your lacking experience.<p>good luck<p>PS.

Since you know which emails are being sent, automatically stop any emails from reaching the sellers that are obvious duplicates (eg. someone sending 100 emails from bob@bobscam.com would not be sent to the seller's email box).",1242349014

I was thinking along the line of social search/crowdsourcing, i.e. when  a request is made to the service via sms, that same sms is sent to the whole community and the responses is ranked and the highest ranked response from the community is sent to the requester via sms.
My question is, can this work? is it scalable? I know this is something that is useless without a community but becomes more useful exponentially as the community grows.",1242348419

Why do I work so hard for ~nothing?"" and then it dawned on me that if it isn't hard, it isn't worth anything. If it was easy, everyone else could do it. If everyone else can do it, why would they pay you to do it?  They won't.<p>It has to be hard.  You have to feel the pain. You have to lie awake at night wondering if you're crazy -- YOU ARE!

609808,comment,608675,609745,0,0,joe_bleau,,,"There are some nice things about the filter in question.  It's very memory efficient--you just need to keep an accumulator with the weighted sum of samples.  You get an output with each input sample, so it's a good fit for continuous signals.  You can pick the coefficients so that the math is shift and add, something handy with old and slow CPUs.<p>I don't know why they throw away so much of the ADC resolution.  I suspect that the sensors are the weak link, not the analog conditioning circuitry or the ADC.  Still, 4 bits is a pretty crummy sensor.<p>I see some irony in that if they'd written it in assembly language instead of C, the outside analysis probably wouldn't have found nearly as many of the bugs and other issues to complain about.",1242346187

Or (2) the data is transmitted securely, decrypted at the backup server, encrypted there with a key known to the backup service and saved; on restores, the data is decrypted at the backup server using the service's key, then returned securely to the user's machine (most other online backup services work this way).<p>The second model is, as you say, insecure--which is why it is a big competitive disadvantage.<p>The first model can be smart, of course, and employ the user's private encryption key which never leaves the client PC only for personal files, and use some other method on Windows system files, commercial application executables, and other files which are duplicated on millions of machines (identified on the client before encryption).<p>FWIW, Connected Online Backup does both incremental backups by changed file blocks and also does identification of files it already has seen and so doesn't need to send again (at all), while keeping the encryption key only on the client PC.  You're right about the current price--Connected wants $995/yr for 50GB.  Obviously that price level can't last much longer.",1242346135

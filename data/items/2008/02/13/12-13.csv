Rather than use this as an opportunity to debate the U.S. political process, I'd like to consider the ramifications for online communities, including this one. Should folks get a greater voice if they are more invested? Would they help to stem the influence of community drift that we've seen at places like reddit? Why shouldn't we listen to people we trust more by virtue of their involvement?",1202907172
114795,story,,,4,5,Electro,"What creative things do you do?",,"I'm not going to judge what is creative or not, if you believe it's creative then say it. For example: I'm a writer, which is clasical 'creative'; my brother is a coder, he developed my website in rails and talent required to do a good job (and the numerous other things he's made, like Skype extensions) I consider him talented - sadly our webserver is screwing up Rails, so we're looking for somewhere to transfer too (any suggestions?).<p>So, if you like say... oragami death cannon, please tell!",1202906478

114792,story,,,3,0,gizliajan,"Ask YC: Robust, lightweight load-balancing web server that does SCGI?",,"I am developing an application in a high-level language and want to interface it with an existing web server.  I have implemented the SCGI protocol in 15 minutes as it is really simple and I don't really need the extra complexity of FastCGI.<p>The web server will do load-balancing, compression, serving static stuff and and maybe some SSL.<p>I know of Apache, Cherokee and lighttpd.  Cherokee doesn't appear to load-balance SCGI and doesn't do SCGI over Unix domain sockets.  Lighttpd does all that and is fast but it unexpectedly fails (""no FastCGI handler found"") when stress-tested.  Also the 1.5 version is still very beta.  Cherokee doesn't do concurrent SCGI connections or load-balancing and seems to be stalled for a year (for instance, it's forums page points nowhere).  Apache, well, it's apache, doesn't do SCGI over Unix domain sockets, has low performance (about 50% less than lighttpd) and apparently you need to combine various unrelated modules in a funky way to get something similar to load-balancing.<p>Do you know of any other alternatives?  I've heard of nginx but it doesn't do scgi it seems.",1202905914

6078203,comment,6077395,6077395,2,0,shawnreilly,,,"I really identify with this project. This is actually a super hard problem to solve, and I commend you guys for taking it on. Here is some genuine feedback / constructive criticism; If you want to attract quality Idea Guys, you should probably address Intellectual Property (IP). I hate to generalize, but most of the Idea Guys I know are somewhat protective of their Ideas, because they don&#x27;t want them to be &quot;stolen&quot; (which may or may not be a misconception). If you can figure out how to solve this (perceived) problem, you&#x27;re probably going to end up with more quality Ideas. Another thing here is the potential for white noise. Most of the Developers I know are too busy to scroll through multiple pages of ideas, especially if the quality is inconsistent (great idea, fart app, great idea, fart app, etc). Maybe consider implementing an upvote / downvote system similar to what they do here at HN, or at StackOverflow. This would allow the community to dictate what ideas they think kick ass, which not only validates the ideas, but helps the Developers identify the good ideas. Keep up the good work!",1374393563

6078201,comment,6077803,6077954,3,0,PavlovsCat,,,"If you&#x27;re knowledgeable of something, you may not know what it&#x27;s like to be ignorant about it, but you do recognize the ignorance itself. But this doesn&#x27;t go both ways, it&#x27;s rather like a big circle contains the area of a smaller one, but not the other way around. You can see &quot;blind&quot; people, but they can&#x27;t really see you. They hear and feel some things, and think that&#x27;s all there is to it, but you know there is more. That is, after you found out about their blindness by them walking over paintings you made, maybe even made as a gift for them. Or even worse, you see them falling into manholes every day, and each time you tell them about it, especially in the blunt way of kids, they attack you for &quot;thinking you see something they don&#x27;t, thinking you&#x27;re better&quot;. This is even more true for adults being showed up by kids; the people who can deal with that are rare, most use their position or power to shut the kid up, or eave it at a stupid, patronizing, insulting response.<p>Needless to say, this can be very confusing and painful. It&#x27;s not like anyone ever tells you &quot;I&#x27;m acting this way because I feel threatened by you&quot;, it&#x27;s always some stupid mind fuck and always your fault. I still would never say it hurts more than being stupid, and let&#x27;s not forget the perks that come with being gifted, either... I don&#x27;t disagree with what you said, but still: &quot;just as dire&quot; does not mean &quot;exactly the same&quot;.<p>There are, by definition, more people who can understand the most stupid, than those who who can understand the most gifted, and the sadness of seeing how the world could be, and how it is, and how third-hand many of the excuses many people make are, that is not a feature of the other extreme. Ignorance is bliss, as they say. And just consider the likely very different reactions to &quot;I&#x27;m sad because I&#x27;m more stupid than the people around me&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m sad because the people around me are more stupid than me&quot;. Both are perfectly valid reasons to be sad, but only one of them tends to get a hissy-scratchy response, especially when it&#x27;s true.",1374393462
6078200,comment,6077803,6078006,23,0,dkural,,,"Just don&#x27;t get too used to thinking being gifted is particularly rare and requires a different system to thrive.  Many acquaintances of mine at a certain crimson ivy university grew up with similar notions, and got into a different kind of depression once being surrounded by other &#x27;gifted&#x27; individuals - due to having the &#x27;world view&#x27; they&#x27;ve internalized so far, around the notion of them being special, getting totally crushed. Many also got used to explaining away their flaws as somehow being related to them being brilliant. This notion of specialness being crushed, they also saw those thing for what they are - failings, i.e. that they fail to connect with young people their age due to poor social skills, and not due to them gifts; and this becomes obvious now that others around them are also smart, etc. They realized that even if you&#x27;re 1/1000 this means Facebook could staff the entire company with even more gifted Americans, and you&#x27;d still not make it, and so on.<p>These people are also crushed to learn upon graduation that people don&#x27;t automatically revel in their obvious greatness, and that they need to earn their place by actually delivering / &#x27;executing&#x27; on some of that potential.<p>TL;DR: Smart teenagers tend to not realize they are still 99% teenager, 1% smart. That itself is a teenager like habit.<p>Humans have roughly similar meta-emotional makeups and thrive in environments that cater to this. Gifted or not, children and teenagers thrive where they can expand their social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual boundaries and capabilities in a trusting, safe, encouraging environment.  Thus the &#x27;system&#x27; is the same, the gifted merely require a different mix of &#x27;content&#x27;. They may be advanced in certain ways but normal or behind in others.",1374393422

These questions are somehow comming up &quot;too early&quot; in life wrt to their capacity to cope with them.

Try to learn to enjoy them as crazy as that sounds - focus on how amazing it is that your body can do all that stuff just from an adrenaline response.

6078161,comment,6076381,6078105,2,0,ReidZB,,,"Sure. The purpose of a salt in password storage is to prevent the pre-computation of a gigantic rainbow table, which essentially acts as a lookup table. (Rainbow tables use less disk space in exchange for more time per lookup.)<p>Here, the salt only needs to be sufficiently long to make the rainbow table huge enough that it can&#x27;t be computed in a timely or efficient fashion. So, a salt that&#x27;s only a single printable ASCII character in length is rather short and probably insufficient; an attacker could build a rainbow table of the top X most common passwords (taken from previous leaked password lists) with every possible character as a salt and then use this against a leaked DB.<p>On the other hand, a massive salt doesn&#x27;t help much in this phase either. A salt of fifteen characters is more than sufficient to prevent a rainbow table from including all possible salts, so there&#x27;s not much of a point in using something ridiculous like a 100-char salt.<p>But once the DB is leaked, assuming a rainbow table is not feasible, an attacker instead will swap over to brute-force attacks (usually trying dictionary lookups first to find the very weakest passwords, then doing other techniques like trying common words with letters replaced with 1337 digits, and so on). Here, the attacker knows the salt (by virtue of the DB being leaked) and so the most important factor is how fast the attacker can try potential passwords. This is where MD5 breaks, of course; it&#x27;s far too fast. An attacker with virtually no funding can test billions of passwords per seconds (on a GPU), and so a large Bitcoin GPU farm could be repurposed to crack salted MD5&#x27;d passwords at an extremely scary rate.<p>In fact, the block size of MD5 is 512 bits (64 bytes), so all strings with less than 64 bytes should take about the same time to hash. Thus, even a 40-byte salt with MD5 won&#x27;t affect password cracking rates until the passwords hit 20 characters long, and a password that long is rarely cracked anyway. Even a 64-byte salt would only make the hashing take about twice as long, and when you&#x27;re testing billions of passwords per second anyways, twice as long doesn&#x27;t sound like much. (Actually, if you prepend the salt to the password, I can think of an attack where only the partial blocks at the end of the salt affect the brute-force attempt, which would make the salt&#x27;s length not affect the cracking rate at all.)<p>So in sum, before the DB is leaked, the salt needs to have enough entropy to prevent pre-computing all possible salt values. Once the DB is leaked, the attacker doesn&#x27;t much care about the salt length anymore because they know now all the salts used.",1374391922

These people break away from an automatic, rote, socialized view of life (which Dbrowski called negative adjustment) and move into and through a series of personal disintegrations. Dbrowski saw these disintegrations as a key element in the overall developmental process. Crises challenge our status quo and cause us to review our self, ideas, values, thoughts, ideals, etc. If development continues, one goes on to develop an individualized, conscious and critically evaluated hierarchical value structure (called positive adjustment). This hierarchy of values acts as a benchmark by which all things are now seen, and the higher values in our internal hierarchy come to direct our behavior (no longer based on external social mores). These higher, individual values characterize an eventual second integration reflecting individual autonomy and for Dbrowski, mark the arrival of true human personality. At this level, each person develops his or her own vision of how life ought to be and lives it. This higher level is associated with strong individual approaches to problem solving and creativity. One&#x27;s talents and creativity are applied in the service of these higher individual values and visions of how life could be - how the world ought to be. The person expresses his or her &quot;new&quot; autonomous personality energetically through action, art, social change and so on.</i>",1374391372

Scientists are too-often not trained well enough in how to evaluate the model they are using to see if it is appropriate for the task, and peer review boards often do not include statisticians.<p>A simple summary of how this can apply to vitamin supplements: suppose you do a trial where you give different groups different doses of a vitamins and then monitor their health. Most vitamins are detrimental to have too little of, helpful to have the right amount of, and then increasingly detrimental to have too much of. The graph of their benefit/harm would be a curve starting at a low number, curving up to a high peak, and then dropping down to lower and lower numbers off to infinity. If you fit this graph to a line, you&#x27;ll see a downward slope, giving an indication like &quot;multivitamins increase mortality rates&quot;.",1374390529

His assertion was that you would be protected if your home project was not in conflict with your duties at the company, even if the company has other branches or departments working on something similar. He referenced some case law which involved an employee at either DEC SRC or DEC WRL who was working on his own thing, started a company and DEC tried to claim ownership based on the &#x27;we do that&#x27; variant. Except he wasn&#x27;t part of the group that did the conflicting work or involved with it.

After all nobody who is suing their employer for ownership of their work stays an employee (at will work clauses).

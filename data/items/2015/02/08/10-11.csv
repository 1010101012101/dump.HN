(never saw this (Java) on aircraft thankfully, only ships)<p>A certain UK system also had code for controlling the HUD in ADA, but the main flight control system in C++, again via CORBA interfaces..<p>This wasn&#x27;t always the case - some Solaris stuff on submarines was all C++ (with Sun&#x27;s compiler), but it was frightening the complexity of it.",1423393178

Dachshund--huge appetite, genetic problems from over breeding.  Fearless!  As a child I had to pull her off the >100 German Shepard.  She ran out and grabbed his neck until I got her to realease.<p>2.  Bullmastiff--Big sweet, but with genetic problems due to \nover breading.<p>3.  American Bulldog/Pit mixes.  The two had no obvious genetic problems, but for brothers from the same litter they had \nvastly different personalities.(One was so aggressive, and \nneurotic a vet put him on Prozac--didn&#x27;t do anything, like my experience on SSRI&#x27;s.)   The one thing that I never expected was both would Only urinate and deficate in my backyard.  I \ntook them on vacation and they held it for two days.  I took them on walk and for 14 years they never once relieved themselves until they got home?  I never used negative reinforcement?  Actually, they were potty trained in a few day.  One other thing, they were both males, but never lifted their leg to urinate?  Neither of them would \nover eat, even when given something really good?<p>4.  One thing about all the dogs in my life;  they seemed to \nhave more common sense than a lot of by buddies at the time?\nI never saw my dogs eat shit, but if I did see them eat grass\nwhen they were not feeling well--which makes sense?  I never saw one eat shit, but their might be something good about about it(reintroduce good bacteria?)<p>5.  They were my best friends!",1423393035

What an incredibly <i>short-sighted</i> thing to say from someone who&#x27;s apparently admired by many for his ideas.<p>The people there get malaria because they are the Dark Ages in terms of living conditions. Bringing Internet there, allowing them to at least educate themselves, giving them the opportunity to find jobs online, or to create a local market is what will give them the chance to get out of poverty and afford better living conditions.<p>The Internet will also help them live in more democratic societies where abuses by the government or criminal groups are exposed and dealt with.<p>There are usually two schools of thought for dealing with Africa&#x27;s poverty. One deals with the now, and it&#x27;s about giving Africans free food, free cloths and free medicine - forever and ever, and yet it never seems to be enough. It merely helps some <i>survive</i>.<p>And the other is about the <i>future</i>, and about trying to help people help themselves out of poverty. It&#x27;s much more sustainable and it&#x27;s about much more than just helping Africans survive. It&#x27;s about getting them to catch-up to other countries in terms of living conditions, income and of course <i>healthcare</i>.

9016934,comment,9015092,9015092,0,0,arvinjoar,,,"While I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment I think a lot of the economic thinking is a bit too simplistic, especially in our current age. For example, whether you invest in your government or not, your government will still be able to find funds for the war chest, by printing money if nothing else (or as it works nowadays, the central bank buying government securities). Another problem I can identify is that some <i>hard work</i> requires a lot education, we need nurses for example. What would happen if nurses only worked 20 hour weeks? Maybe there&#x27;s a clever answer for this too, but I think we really need to think hard about this before we advocate anything politically.

I was born in Greece to Greek parents and feel extremely unlucky about this, sort of being born in a completely third world country.<p>The level that the Greeks (not all of them, but to an extraordinary extend) fail to comprehend reality is astonishing. The modus operandi here is &quot;do whatever other people do around you&quot;. And what is that? Slowing drag your feet through education, which is laughable and teaches almost nothing of practical value, go out as much as you can, drink coffee for hours on end talking about crap every day, study &quot;whatever you like&quot; failing to understand that some (most!) university departments are terribly anachronistic and will lead to unemployment with certainty, etc, etc. It&#x27;s a failure from top to bottom: parents and especially teachers are freeloader lazy people and this is exactly what they teach to the young, by every aspect of social interaction.<p>I lost too many years of my life, trying to find out what&#x27;s wrong with me, and eventually found out about Paul Graham, and startups, and ambition, dammit!<p>I read a comment somewhere about the US/western Europe just nuking the place and felt so in tune with it.<p>In fact, the people here are just unlucky, like me. They don&#x27;t even comprehend what it means to work. They say stuff like &quot;Greeks work more than Germans!&quot; and they go to work 1 or 2 hours late and talk for hours about last night&#x27;s football match.<p>Empirical data towards a proof of what I&#x27;m saying: I was saying those stuff to a sibling of mine, and they were hating me, as most people do here. But then, they moved to a Western European country, and after several years of trying to adjust, they now tell me that they themselves regard the Greeks to be lazy whining freeloaders.<p>I apologize for the rant. My question is this:<p>Why the German government, and Western European countries more advanced and with better &quot;culture&quot; in general, doesn&#x27;t try to help Greeks become more like them, starting from education?

I think what he&#x27;s done is pretty heroic, at least in modern terms, and something that very few, possibly none, of us would be willing to pull the trigger on.<p>Wether he&#x27;s made, or is still making, a fortune is besides the point. He made the hard choice and has made it clear to everyone who&#x27;s asked that he is all the better for it. This more than anything else is a powerful and important example that we may or may not see again. If nothing else he has highlighted the need for more empathy in software. His focus seems to be in bringing joy and entertainment to people and doesn&#x27;t appear to have any ulterior motive. This is rare and we should be celebrating it rather than dismiss it by the fact that he has been fortunate enough to actually be successful from it (something that is also extremely rare).",1394564313

The offer lets me work from home where ever I want (with some restrictions). So home cost isn&#x27;t relevant to me.<p>And on the college tuition front: While I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily advise it of today&#x27;s high school graduates, by the time my kids are ready for college I don&#x27;t expect college to look like it does today.<p>Or rather, I expect companies to be more concerned with <i>what you know</i> instead of how you learned it, and with the huge movement toward making effectively entire college educations free online, I think that the face of college will be transformed -- and made correspondingly less expensive -- by then.<p>It&#x27;s already true to some extent, and if the question is between going into serious debt or getting a college degree, I think the prudent choice might be to use free or inexpensive online courses to get a degree rather than piling up serious debt for a questionable advantage in getting a job. It seems like &quot;free internships&quot; are already the way to get on-the-job experience, and that&#x27;s a lot harder to accomplish if you&#x27;ve got a huge debt that&#x27;s demanding to be paid.<p>In addition, politically speaking I think we&#x27;re at the extreme right end of the pendulum swing right now, and once things swing back a bit to the left, state schools will become more affordable again. A lot of the rise in costs has been correlated with the fall in state funding. Though the rest of the rise in costs can be attributed to the rise in administration salaries; almost a half million/year for a UC Regent?

The movie industry is nice an healthy, they make more money each year then the previous. The reason they fight against piracy is simple - they want more money. If there&#x27;s a chance to get more money, why not try? In reality, piracy is negligible and is not worth the policing effort. More importantly, eliminating piracy altogether will not convert all pirates to movie goers. That&#x27;s absurd! A pirate is a person who will either steal a movie or not watch it. Either way they are not paying for it. Only a small percentage of pirates will switch to paying customers in a perfect scenario. So in reality, the industry will enjoy a negligible profit increase - that&#x27;s all. Considering their current ever increasing profits from year to year, the industry is booming. They only reason they are chasing after pirates is because they are driven by they greed and incorrect perception of &#x27;opportunity cost&#x27;. They see a huge chunk of potential pie because they imagine that once they are able to police movie watching completely, then every pirate will be paying them royalties. This is of course far from the truth. Greedy and dimwitted they persist to believe that illusion. I wonder what positive effects move piracy has on the industry that the industry is benefiting from but are not aware of? Perhaps free word of mouth advertising on an enormous scale? I think more people pirate movies than pay which means that a immense audience is functioning as free word of mouth advertisers. What impact would eliminating this group have on the industry? Worth to think about.",1394563604

Poorer people are reverse-migrating from the denser parts of the country to the Sun Belt.<p>And it&#x27;s a problem. The high cost of living in many of the &quot;desirable&quot; parts of the country is artificially created by government regulation of housing (as well as other markets, thanks to the propensity of densely populated municipalities to be run by liberals). But with the services sector growing, it makes more sense for poorer people to live near the wealthy people (who are going to be in the desirable parts of the country), since those are the people who can and will buy services.

That&#x27;s what the group think tells us, but in ones personal reality it&#x27;s not that easy to shrug off. Over the decades I&#x27;ve been on the teams of high profile games and films with medium levels of violence. After each title is released, I&#x27;d receive a half dozen or so &quot;fan&quot; emails from people who obviously researched the dev team and was reaching out. On the games with medium levels of violence, of the half dozen fan emails only one would be praise, the others would be serious hate mail.

So where do you direct your limited resources?<p>Some candidate strategies: minimax with AB, exhaustive, MC sampling.<p>Even with any of these strategies, we can usually only search the game state tree to a given depth. (This is the tree of &#x27;If I go here, then the game goes there, then I go here etc&#x27;.)  When we reach our depth limit (if we haven&#x27;t reached a terminal state - i.e. a win or loss), we use a heuristic (maybe &#x27;number of free tiles&#x27;) which approximates the value of the state to us at that point.<p>>Meanwhile, the computer has only a few possible moves, increasing the probability of doing something accidentally optimal.<p>If the computer only has a few possible moves, then, yes, it might randomly choose the best one.  But if it only has a few possible moves, chances are that any tree search technique, even stochastic, will start to expand all of them.<p>The question is, though, how will you know how good each of these moves is when you start examining are?  I.e. Which of the moves available to you right now should you make?  With Minimax/AB, you&#x27;ll get a sense the move is optimal, because you&#x27;ll look at the consequences of the move, (if the game makes the worst response to me (if I make the best move for me (if the game makes the worst response for me ... (heuristic evaluation)))).<p>With (sensible) MC search, you&#x27;ll instead get a sense of which move is optimal by looking at more like what happens (if I make the best move for me (for each of a bunch of random moves the game could make (then if I make the best move for me (for each of a bunch of random moves the game could make ... (heuristic evaluation)))).<p>My point is that the latter is more suitable for this domain.<p>>As you approach the end, needing over half the board just for unbuilt path up to 1024 and thereby not having as much scratch space, the probability of it hitting a problematic (even if not &quot;devastating&quot;, one that suddenly requires you to reorganize things to &quot;clean up the mess&quot;) move seems more more of a problem than when playing chess.<p>Well, then, if the probability of it randomly hitting a problematic move is high in a certain state, your MC search will be highly likely to come across that move, and thus you&#x27;ll be likely to avoid moves that bring you to that state.  So, no problem.<p>In summary:  1) If the game is highly likely to make a devastating move by random chance, then you are highly likely to come across that move in your stochastic search, so that&#x27;s not really an objection.  2) In this game, just as in chess, there are always more states you&#x27;d like to search and expand than you have the resources to.  Even if the computer only has a handful of &#x27;moves&#x27; at any time, in order to tell how good these moves around, you&#x27;ve still got to expand out a lot of states.  Choosing to use minimax instead of MC doesn&#x27;t save you from that.",1394562727

I&#x27;ve never actually been bitten by that. In general though, I think this pattern scales poorly - the more complicated your task is, the more like the &quot;force it&quot; mode is going to be more and more dangerous.<p>---<p>On the subject of what to do when something goes wrong:\nSometimes retrying installing a package <i>does</i> fix the problem: if there was a network error, for example, and you downloaded an incomplete set of files, the next time you run it it will be fine.<p>If your package manager goes off the rails and gets your system into an inconsistent state, then you have a decision to make. Is this going to happen again? If not, just fix the stupid thing manually: there&#x27;s no point in automating a one-time task. If it is probably recurring, then, you need to write some code to fix it (and file a bug report to your distro!). I do not believe that there is a safe, sane way to pre-engineer your automation to fix problems you haven&#x27;t seen yet!<p>In the meantime maybe your automation framework stupidly tries to run the install script every 20 minutes and reports recurring failure. The cost of that is low.<p>Docker is awesome, for sure, and I&#x27;ll definitely use it on my next server-side project. It isn&#x27;t a magic bullet, though - you still have to configure things, they still have dependencies. Just, hopefully, failures are more constrained.<p>---<p>and on the point of upgrading for security fixes: the sad reality is that even critical fixes for security holes must be tested on a staging environment. No upgrade is ever really, truly guaranteed to be safe.

In general, we have to distinguish submissions to Hacker News based on press releases (there are way too many of those) from review articles by experienced researchers that digest the primary research done by a variety of researchers around the world. The latter kind of submission (a review article from a peer-reviewed journal or a book chapter from a practitioner&#x27;s handbook) would be an excellent submission to Hacker News if it has a link that lives online for free reading, but it would also mean reading something longer than something that can be summed up with a one-line lt;dr summary. Otherwise, a thoughtful article by a science journalist who interviews scientists besides the scientists hyping a new discovery can be much better than a new &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; preliminary research finding. All too often, in our haste for &quot;news&quot; here about medical research, all the hackers here can be led astray about what is really established knowledge in medicine.",1394561930

In case someone here isn&#x27;t familiar with minimax, the OP wrote some very elegant and well-commented code that would be a great primer.<p>The less computationally-intensive approach we came up with was to model the game state as a graph G(V, E), where V is the set of active tiles and E is a set of edges connecting adjacent tiles, weighted by the function c(v1, v2), which returns the absolute value of the difference between two tiles. For each decision, the AI picks the move that minimizes the sum of all edge weights in the new game state.<p>The reasoning behind this is that the only way to progress in the game is to have tiles of equal values adjacent to each other, for which the weight in G would be 0. Thus, the AI should try to minimize total weight. Eventually there will be large numbers on the boards with large edge weights to adjacent tiles, so the AI would try to keep these tiles next to other large tiles to minimize the difference.<p>Since the game is stochastic the approach I described may not work in a worst case scenario, but it could also be applied to the existing minimax solution as the weight function for each node in the tree.",1394561844

What was interesting was that between when I started that job in 2005 and when I left for the final time in 2010, my coworkers went from being mostly high school and college kids to all sorts of folks of varying ages and backgrounds. That was the most telling sign of the recession to me. I strolled in to pick up my job where I&#x27;d left off in 2010 and I remember every single day people asking for job applications. I had thoughts like, why would <i>you</i> want to work <i>here</i>? This is a job for kids! But we even had a PhD biologist for a while.<p>Conditions have been deteriorating for a while now. Extended hours on holidays, terrible scheduling, and peculiar &quot;performance measurement&quot; tools. At my particular store, they adopted a system of tracking how many transactions a cashier performed per hour and then penalizing them when those transactions exceeded a certain number. The thought was that if a cashier rang up so many customers an hour, then some of them had had to <i>wait in line</i> and the cashier was at fault for not calling backup. (What backup? And what if they were just a really fast cashier?) Another was the obsession with collecting customers&#x27; email addresses. Cashiers were expected to collect so many email addresses a day or week or whatever or be <i>threatened with losing their job</i>.<p>My silly, between school semesters little retail gig had become very stressful towards the end because of the obsession with these metrics and a general attitude of &quot;I could fire you today and have someone cheaper by tomorrow&quot;.",1394561553

The highest number on the board is always in the upper left. Make the top row descend left to right.<p>3. Before combining values on the top row, keep hitting up until one of the lower rows will not combine from a left.<p>4. Often, the slot you are filling (eg, top right or one below top right) will have a two. Alternate pressing left and right until a two appears, allowing you to combine<p>5. Keep the second row locked as soon as possible with unique values ASCENDING left to right.

Unfreeze the second row by combining squares & hope that a two appears in the new opening<p>* only 2&#x27;s or 4&#x27;s will appear.

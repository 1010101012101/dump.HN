9405586,comment,9397979,9401898,0,0,nostrademons,,,"FWIW, that narrative you hold for SnapChat doesn&#x27;t actually match up with the facts.  They first floated the idea in April 2011, and launched the product in June 2011.  [1] It was not funded until May 2012, with the first meeting with VCs in March 2012.  At the time of funding, they had about 100,000 users and served roughly 25 images/sec [2].<p>Now, I&#x27;m not personally a SnapChat user/employee/investor, and I think some of the other information that has come to light about Evan Spiegel and SnapChat&#x27;s business practices is pretty reprehensible.  But the narrative that actually fits the facts is a much more straightforward one: a driven entrepreneur builds a product with the help of his buddies, convinces a critical mass of people to use it, gets it growing fast, and <i>then</i> VC piles in hoping to get a piece of the next big thing.  No sinister conspiracies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Snapchat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Snapchat</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/12/snapchat-not-sexting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/12/snapchat-not-sexting/</a>",1429491475

Some comments later in this thread have mentioned that this might be an upcoming feature in the near future, which is great.<p>Without server-side rendering?

Basic HTML Gmail is also a ton faster than the normal version ...<p>You can however use CSS transitions effectively to make the user <i>think</i> the page is faster. Just have some action flying around (it&#x27;s offloaded to the GPU if you&#x27;re doing it &quot;right&quot;) while things are being processed and it won&#x27;t &quot;count&quot; towards the user&#x27;s perception of page load speed.<p>e.g. Your HTML-only page loads in 200ms, your XHR-/Angular/jQueryified version loads in 1000ms, but you want the user to use and like the latter. Make the page dance around for the first 900 ms, and the user will &quot;feel&quot; that your new version loads in 100 ms. You don&#x27;t want to push this &quot;effective loading speed&quot; all the way to 0 or else the user will become aware of your trick.

Granted, it&#x27;s debatable how much worse but Bing / Duck Duck go are viewed as competitive search engines not <i>better</i> search engines.

After a while the &#x27;better&#x27; engine generally becomes their dealt.<p>Windows on the other hand has a lot of inertia due to third part integration.  For example there is a much smaller selection of games on OS X than windows which creates a feedback loop.  There is no way OS X could hit 50% market share in 3 years let alone a brand new OS starting from scratch, but search has seen massive swings in market share fairly recently.<p>PS: The g! feature is also great for fine tuning their search engine.

9405456,comment,9402397,9405023,0,0,mikekchar,,,"To be honest, I don&#x27;t see how you could possibly do fractional reserve with Bitcoin.  By definition fractional reserve is lending more currency than you have.  Banks can do this because they are allowed to create the money that they lend.  So if I am allowed a 10:1 ratio of lending and reserve, as long as I maintain $1 in my reserve, I&#x27;m allowed to lend $10.  Those $10 are poofed into existence when the loan is created, though.<p>As another person mentioned, I think you are confusing lending with reserve banking.  A bank (or any entity) is allowed to lend as much money as they want to someone if they are actually lending money that they have.  That&#x27;s not fractional reserve.  Fractional reserve creates money.  The fraction limits how much money you are allowed to create.<p>You can&#x27;t do that with Bitcoin by design.  Of course, you can lend money (that you have) with Bitcoin.  There is currently no automated way to record that the transaction was a loan as opposed to a payment, but that&#x27;s true of all currencies.  In fact Bitcoin had some plans to implement contracts in the protocol, but I don&#x27;t think anyone has done it yet.<p>If I am to opine slightly, I think that Bitcoin&#x27;s lack of ability to do fractional reserve is probably a mistake.  I think it relegates it to a payment method as opposed to a viable currency.  The problem with Bitcoin as a currency is the lack of availability.  Although it often doesn&#x27;t look like it, I think the purpose of a currency is to get resources into the hands of people who need resources, but don&#x27;t have it.  With Bitcoin, the currency is a limited resource and those that have it have no particular reason to spread it around.  With a more traditional currency, the money supply can grow to match demand.  The banks which create the currency have an incentive to loan money because the money that they are loaning is springing into existence at that time -- they aren&#x27;t loaning their own money.  The only thing the banks need to worry about is that on average, the growth produced by the loan is greater than the interest charged.  Having a fluid money supply like this allows people who do not have money to get it and reduces inefficiencies (i.e. people being idle because they don&#x27;t have the resources to produce something).<p>Having said all that, I have no idea how you could implement fractional reserve in a distributed system and have any protection for horrible abuses.  Until that problem is solved, I can&#x27;t really see a way for this kind of currency to act as a true currency (as opposed to a payment method).  If I remember correctly, there was a review of Bitcoin by a prominent economist a few years ago that pointed out this problem.",1429489005

I am excited for the possibility of an S3-like storage system under the same roof as Slicehost.

Just finished putting together the new support system, which is still email-based, but also logs everything in a private ticket system and texts if there's an emergency.<p>Response time: it varies, but it's definitely good to send a ""hey we're looking into it"" canned response so their issue is acknowledged.

340480,comment,339897,339897,0,0,manmanic,,,"My answer seems to differ from most people here.<p>I do all sales and support once per day, first thing in the morning, getting the mailboxes to completely empty. I then glance at the mailboxes a few more times during the day, but don't send any more replies till the next morning. The only exception is if there's an urgent issue or serious bug.<p>This works for me because:<p>* I can concentrate on productive work (building new features) most of the day without serious distraction. If I were to reply to emails all day long, I'd get far less done.<p>* In my experience, users put that little bit more effort into solving problems themselves, if they're given the motivation to do so. They read documentation and FAQs. If you reply to emails within half an hour, you'll often find yourself in a lengthy back-and-forth that takes up a lot of time.<p>This second point might sound like heresy in a world where the customer is always right. But it's not so bad to lose customers whose opportunity cost in time is greater than their revenue is ever going to be worth.<p>While a small minority of users are unhappy to wait more than an hour or two for a reply, a guaranteed 24 hour turnaround is still pretty good compared to large companies.",1224705293

I just finished university, and have been in 3 startup situations so far, none of which have gone anywhere. That's not to say I didn't learn some very valuable lessons. In fact, I learned things in these failed startups that I might not have learned any other way. In addition, I am still alive, and stronger for having walked through the fire a few times.<p>I think the most important thing for someone like you is to start generating momentum. Let me explain how you might go about this.<p>1. There is no mistake, only make.<p>Build stuff. Fail. Just make sure you fail quickly and cheaply. If you actually bring an idea to life you have succeeded no matter what happens. You will have seperated yourself from everyone else who has ideas but never acts. Ideas are just ideas if no one does the tough, painful work required to actually execute them. Like a young piano prodigy the more you can practice actually building stuff the better you will get.<p>2. Go to events.<p>Talk to other entrepreneurs/programmers/designers about what they are doing. Ask lots of questions and learn. It's tough to learn anything if you never keep your mouth shut.<p>3. Learn about business.<p>I realize some people on this site are code-centric, but in reality it's only one piece of the pie. You will be better off if you read and understand what makes good businesses tick. Everything from branding, copy, and positioning to pricing, business models, and marketing. It helps to learn all of it. I would be happy to recommend some great books if you contact me.<p>4. Start learning about what people want.<p>Try and understand what makes people use particular web sites. Is it speed? ease of use? unique design? Copywriting? Branding? Or did the site take an old idea and put a unique spin on it? Perhaps you can take elements of certain ideas and combine, bundle, or package them in new ways.<p>This is getting way too long, but I hope anyone who reads this gets some value from this post. Feel free to contact me anytime. I would be glad to share any of the information or resources I have gained from years spent learning from advisors, mentors, books, blogs, and anyone at anytime.<p>Best wishes.<p>Dan H.",1224702796

The industry doesn't appear to have ""caught up"" yet.<p>Mac OS X turned seven in March, although perhaps it didn't really start taking over the world until 10.2 or 10.3, in the 2002-2003 timeframe. The ""shine"" has not faded. Market share is growing. Microsoft tried to ""catch up"" in the shininess battle with Vista, but they swung and missed. The Linux desktop has a core audience but is conspicuously lacking in ""shine"" and has so far posed little threat to the Mac's market.<p>So my best guess is that the iPhone platform has at least five years of life in it, maybe more. Maybe much more -- based on what we've seen with Apple's other products, iPhone has a very good chance of being a <i>dominant</i> platform in its niche for five years or more. It even has a finite chance of becoming the basis of a Microsoft-like multi-decade monopoly.<p>You can, of course, argue that the <i>hype</i> around the phone will never last that long, just as the hype around Macs and iPods is now over: The ""special and new"" has become the ""standard and expected"".

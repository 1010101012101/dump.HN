It's not as if you have 'more secure' and 'less secure' when you add up the mistakes on both sides.  What you're really comparing is one insecure operating system to another insecure operating system and there is no solid reason to believe that computer software can or will _ever_ be secure (whatever being secure means).\n",1193781574

74379,comment,74350,74350,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The Virgin Airlines story is probably apocryphal.  According to Branson's autobiography, Virgin Airlines was the idea of Randolph Fields, an American lawyer with no background in the airline industry.  He got a couple pilot friends to help him out with it and then approached Branson for funding.  Branson liked the idea (mostly because ""it'd be <i>fun</i>""), and funded it over the objections of the other Virgin Group executives.<p>It's similar to Steve Jobs' role in Pixar: he had little to do with the initial idea or execution, but put up nearly all of the cash and so ended up with majority ownership.",1193780002

Turns out this customer was from SV and worked for Apple, although he never mentioned what he really did. He suggested that if I ""want to make money"" to learn AppleScript. I taught myself by just reading tutorials online, and learned you can do some pretty cool stuff with AppleScript. However, I personally would say one should put more focus on Objective-C and Cocoa. I began doing that (many tutorials online), but soon after got into web apps and put my focus elsewhere.<p>So, in my opinion, get a feel for AppleScript, then move on to Objective-C and Cocoa.",1193779282

Most likely, anything you engage in (including too much sport) that is supposed to help you live longer will ultimately shrink your lifetime. Just live. We are  programmed to live as long as we want to (unless a car runs us over). The trick here is to not fight nature, not follow society, and definitely master the differences between ""need"" and ""want"". ",1193779248

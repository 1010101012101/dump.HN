Now Yosemite is free, but is absolute abonimation on 2/4GB machines. On top of that, you have to run XCode. Not to mention the <i>time debt</i> required to upgrade.<p>Now, for indie developer setting, these issues might not be huge. But the problem here is - Apple puts <i>businesses</i> in awkward positions, when they have to bulk buy RAMs and upgrade all the systems just to <i>compile</i> on the newest minor release of iOS. Then, they started soldering RAM, so now to compile on 8.3, buy 25 new Macs or fuck off.<p>Apple&#x27;s actions that screws us - solder RAM, make only latest XCode work with latest SDK, make OS impossible to run on low RAM, make XCode run only on newest OS.",1433851111

Now that they&#x27;re finally offering devices in sizes people want (literally 80% of the new iPhones I see are the 6+), people who wanted the bigger devices but went to Android, are finally seeing a reason to switch back. Furthermore, iOS is finally in good shape compared to Android w/r to features like notifications, multitasking, etc. making the idea of migration parity simpler.<p>I don&#x27;t think this will have a huge impact in conversions, I think the path Apple is on is already doing that, but it&#x27;s not a terrible idea.",1433851105

If the answer is that the apps are 100% web standards compliant then users already have web browsers that can run those apps without needing to use FirefoxOS, so what is the point of FirefoxOS for users?<p>>Recall that Google can decide to revoke Android license from any vendor on arbitrary grounds, and if you lose your Android license, you pretty much lose everything (no AGPS, no Google Maps, no Google Play, etc.)<p>While this is shitty, it still just leaves you pretty much in the same place as FirefoxOS (being able to access (some of) those services through a web browser rather than a native app). If a hardware vendor is worried about losing the licence to use the native google maps app, why would they move to FirefoxOS - a platform without a native google maps app?<p>The entire project seems more about politics and religion than an actual business case.

They also state: &quot;Availability of sources, interaction with Apple representatives, difficulty building and tracking sources, and a lack of interest from the community have all contributed to this.&quot;[24] &quot;<p>Darwin is open source, but to compare that to linux is laughable.

To say Apple and Google are about the same when it comes to Open Source is a joke.

9685263,comment,9685022,9685022,0,0,cjslep,,,"Qt&#x27;s Contributor Summit just ended, and one of the topics was C++11 support [0]. The key takeaway is Qt 5.6 will start the move away from C++98 towards C++11 support, though not fully C++11 mainly due to the MSVC compiler&#x27;s limitations. The joy of being cross-platform.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t immediately see the value of using CS over Qt. Binary size alone is not generally worth jumping ship from an established community. I&#x27;m also not sure why you would replace moc with template magic - moc will generally not fail (or will tell you if, say, you forgot to inherit from QObject), whereas template errors are midæval latin on a good day. The source files generated by moc have a lower bar to read through its generated code (making the Qt framework more accessible and seem less like magic), whereas templates require a very good understanding of metaprogramming (which is a less common skill).<p>Also the 4.8 pick was an odd choice. Many significant changes that happened to 5.0 were made from a maintenance standpoint. Or &quot;lowering technical debt&quot; if you are playing buzzword bingo. Of all the issues, this is the biggest one in my opinion.<p>[0] <a href=""http://wiki.qt.io/QtCS2015_ModernCpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.qt.io/QtCS2015_ModernCpp</a>",1433850293

Now you don&#x27;t have to think about those weird bracketed capital letters. Just take care to check where you have <i>comments</i>[2] that happens to include directives to some external tool.<p>With how Go programming seems to work for some people, I can perfectly well imagine a system with commands that do code generation as a hook for other commands, or by &#x27;listening to the file system&#x27; for changes in certain files. That could get out of hand pretty easily. And yeah, one can say &quot;anything can be taken too far&quot;. Just like you said about generics. The difference might between having well-encapsulated and behaving mechanisms that does most of what you normally would need. As opposed to a &quot;simple&quot; system that just pushes the problem to another level, in more ad-hoc ways.<p>[1] I honestly don&#x27;t know if the code generation typically is pre-, post-compile or a mix of those two.

one liner eval-ing expressions on the command line.  My favorite feature is that 
if symlinked as &quot;hex&quot;, &quot;oct&quot;, or &quot;bin&quot;, it prints the output in hexadecimal,
octal, or binary.  And, because the evaluation is done by perl, hexadecimal,
octal, and binary numbers can be entered using &quot;0x&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, and &quot;0b&quot; prefixes.
A minor improvement was the substitution of commas with underscores, which perl allows in numbers for easier readability.  Entering &quot;1,000,000&quot;
is much nicer on the eyes than carefully counting the number of trailing
zeros.<p>Two weeks ago, after becoming fed up with having to copy and paste
results from one line to the next, I wrapped it in a repl and added
bc(1)-like support for &quot;.&quot; expanding to the last value.  Rather embarrassingly, I

The way to hook me on a get rich quick scheme is to tell me that I&#x27;m slipping through the cracks and need only make one small change.<p>I didn&#x27;t come to this conclusion without lots of attempts over the last decade, though. If I had genuinely wanted to pursue a popular, practical approach, I had many chances to do so. I convinced myself, like many a confused young person, that I did want this, and I took some of them, and the experience was worthwhile, but not enough to stick around for. Successes tended to feel empty; failures felt delusional. The biggest satisfactions usually came when I walked away after getting bored with the idea - yes, bored. Not after a definite, final, concrete answer, but after simply being unwilling to take the next step forward and drifting off. I know that some of those things I walked away from could work, could still work now. I don&#x27;t care.<p>This is a step that my parents stop short of acknowledging. They still live with the burden of &quot;being successful&quot; as a universal, and their struggle as one measured against that universal, tearing themselves apart a day at a time as their behavior mismatches their expectations.<p>What do I actually do? Today I met someone I&#x27;ve only known for an hour or two outside of the internet. We had coffee, and I met some of their relatives. They were on vacation. We had no business together. We just sat and talked, with luxurious pauses and lulls in the conversation. For three hours. It was fine, and now I have a closer friend.<p>And that is <i>me</i>, that is the type of thing I do and like doing. But it&#x27;s not rational thought. I felt and did, and rationalized after. As such the way forward for me is to fuck off with planning my professional career in any more than a broad &quot;make a little, save a lot&quot; conservative generality. If I do anything more risky or ambitious, it&#x27;ll happen suddenly, because it always has, but in most respects I value inner life more.<p>And that is not you, dear reader. Maybe you&#x27;re similar to me. Maybe you&#x27;re more like a founder. Maybe take some personality tests(that are not Myers-Briggs).",1433849563

On the surface, relationships in the US seem very transactional (not making the judgment that they are really transactional). For example, in the US a son would thank his parents for paying his college tuition. In my culture, this would be insulting because it would suggest being distant from family, in the sense that the son ought to believe his parents wealth is his also, and later willingly contribute his earnings when his parents need anything. It is a difference in the degree to which individualism is the norm.<p>Reminds of the book &quot;Debt&quot; by David Graeber. He talks about how many cultures have systems where everyone is indebted to their family and community, and this debt is never to be settled. To want to settle a debt (or to even calculate it) would indicate that a relationship has ended. So it is a huge culture shock to see the degree to which calculation plays a part in US relationships (like Sheryl Sandberg precisely splitting domestic chores with her husband 50:50).<p>I have a feeling that the non-American system is better because it fosters closer family ties, but that might just be because that&#x27;s the system I&#x27;m familiar with.",1433848960

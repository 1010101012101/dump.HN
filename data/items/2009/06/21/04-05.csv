Personally, I find extroverts in general to be a little irritating.   Frankly, I'd rather have you try to explain to me what a fourier transform is than tell me how great your ren faire experience was.<p>the worst are those guys who won't shut up about contrails or jesus or organic food or the democrats or the republicans or corn syrup or whatever.

Maybe not even call centers. Maybe employees are just perpetually on call, forced to ""goggle in"" periodically throughout the day to snake a drain in Brisbane or Bangladesh or Boise.

Break the standard TOS, but get written assurances from Apple in advance (they didn't)\n3. Avoid the market (they didn't)\n4. Take the big risk and hope things work out OK. (they did)<p>Obviously, #4 is a valid option...I just think it's a stupid one for a small company that can't afford to blow a year on something like this, but maybe they can.  Regardless, how can you feel sorry for them?<p>Also, it may seem that Apple approved apps which violate the TOS, but does this developer <i>know</i> that those other app developers didn't arrange this in advance with Apple?  I have a hard time believing that a company like Sega would risk so much time and money developing apps without first talking to Apple and getting some clear assurance that they'd be allowed to sell it when they were done.  Why couldn't this company have done the same?",1245558925

That doesn't mean they couldn't incorporate some protocol patch or use asynchronous I/O or some other crap, but the reliance shouldn't be on Apache to block this.

667117,comment,666440,666771,0,0,apu,,,"<i>I don't think that building a successful start-up is less of an intellectual achievement than doing scientific research.</i><p>I strongly disagree. I have the utmost respect for those who have built successful startups, but virtually none are a very significant <i>intellectual achievement</i>. It takes ambition, dedication, determination, courage, talent, skill, tact, vision, luck, and a hundred other attributes to achieve success in building a startup, but very rarely does it require an intense <i>intellectual</i> effort, and almost never is there any fundamental advancement of scientific thought.<p>Also, having spent time studying computer science, physics, and aeronautical engineering, one major difference I see is the relative maturity and depth of various fields. Computer science is so much newer than physics that there is simply much more unexplored territory at a shallower level -- which doesn't require as much studying to get to -- that it is easier to come up with new ideas there than in physics.",1245558646

Even better, that single encode is the best possible encode you can get, since Flash supports practically unrestricted H.264 playback.<p>HTML5 is going to be a compatibility nightmare.  Of course, this has nothing to do with W3C, but rather the fact that nobody involved can make any agreement on what the standardized format should be, so there just isn't any (and not enough browser vendors have the cajones to do what Google is doing and bundle ffmpeg).",1245558472

But I've always wondered about Amazon.com's UI strategy in the context of choice - they always show me much more crap than I am interested in: on the home page, on search result pages, on product detail pages, pretty much everywhere on their site.

The thing that still rings in my mind is the argument that presentation and content are not really separable.  Still chewing on that one.<p>There were many minor bits of analysis that he did to code, taking up challenges about performance, for example.  I remember one example where he clearly spent hours on one performance claim, rewrote the proposed code within an inch of its life and gave an irrefutable argument about what the performance was.<p>His deep knowledge of SGML (I suspect deeper than all but a handful of folks) was a great source of insight on comp.text.sgml for what seems like a long time.  His many rants about C++ were informative as well as confrontational.  He told of working in C++ and generating very nice looking code, to the satisfaction of the client.  He cheated a bit, however, as he used Lisp to generate the code.<p>There have always been reactions to his blunt, confrontational style.  There are subjects, however, for which there are a right and a wrong.  Erik wouldn't hesitate.

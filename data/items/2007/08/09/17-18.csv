40961,comment,40847,40847,0,0,tyohn,,,"When I finished high school I spent a few years working then I started my own business.  I ran the business for 10 years before selling it two years ago.  Recently I joined the worker bees/cubicle side of things ~ from my perspective working as a cubicle slave sucks! I can't wait till my new business can support my life!  At any rate the other slaves (almost all college educated) really do live their lives for that two week vacation.  But I know the unedamkaed bees (like me) live for that vacation too.  So was it college or just a case of the pareto principle in action ~ 80% of the people are worker bees and 20% are entrepreneurs?",1186681846

Maybe you could start a new search engine and just partner with Google:  <p>""Yo, Larry & Serg, we SO need to work together!""",1186679987
40951,comment,40863,40863,0,0,marrone,,,"Good points. Actually I did the same thing with ""Da Vinci Code"". After like 3 years of avoiding reading it, I finally broke down to read just because it stuck around so long.<p>""How To Get Rich"" by Felix Dennis is another good read related to what Godin is saying. He is in the magazine business, and recommends anyone looking to start something to start it in a growing industry not already entrenched with leaders. ""Ride the wave"" is his suggestion ",1186679847

Facebook is next to meaningless to me... it's cute, a cool way to share photos and waste time, but the connections have no real value, they either existed before or will remain confined to the medium. I'd imagine this is not true for those in college, but accurate for an older user such as myself.<p>2. There is already a perfectly acceptable and available medium for tv - TV! The market of people who have access to  the internet but not TV is rather small - again, an idea that might play better with a college crowd who exist in a world exactly as I described.<p>3. The key to the holy grail of news sites in my mind is the dunbar number (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number</a>), as Davidw points out in his comment. I think if you can find a way to create a site that can harness the strength of this principle, you'll win here.",1186679790

Take for example Google which is valued by the outstanding shares value (market cap) which is driven mostly by public perception of market growth and Google's operation with respect to real and perceived growth..<p>So apply this to your startup.. get VCs to bid on it.. If you have revenues then you can go to a bank and\nsee what type of credit line your business qualifies for.\nBut since most startups don't have revenue then you really don't know. <p>Essentially your initial idea is worth $0... this is why angel investors are nice to have. They make the first real\nvaluation. ",1186679760

The point is to do it better than them. Reading pg's book has great (and funny) commentary on dealing with the competition...",1186679642

No question - that'll do good things for your entrepreneurial spirit.<p>However, I agree with the idea in two situations:<p>1. It does not really FOSTER entrepreneurial spirit - you must cultivate a seed of that elsewhere, and<p>2. Only a very limited set of colleges do NOT completely kill it.\n",1186679557

40943,comment,40888,40934,0,0,parker,,,"So, the secret is a high bohemian ratio?? Man, I've gotta start eating organic. :P<p>But I totally agree, you've got to be a certain personality type to start a startup, and that kind of eccentricity usually finds a way of conglomerating together.  That culture certainly does propagate itself; I know where I live, it's almost a taboo to start something yourself.  I've never been to SF yet, but I get the feeling that it espouses a completely different kind of philosophy?",1186679330

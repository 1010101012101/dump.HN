When I said 20,000 protein-coding genes are not enough, I was referring specifically to the traditional view that one gene codes for one protein.  It's pretty well understood now that this is not the case, and my point was moreso that 20,000 genes in and of themselves fail to code for every different trait/behavior in a reductive model. I think epigenetics provides the powerful toolbox to illuminating on the unlimited # of interactions/permutations of genes that you describe.<p>But what I find most fascinating about epigenetics is its ability to explain environmental vs biological effects on our traits/behavior, not intrinsically described by our genes. As the DNA-methylation described in epigenetics determines which genes are on/off, it is external stimuli that often affect the methylation of epigenetics in the first place.

3009140,comment,3008469,3008469,6,0,jrockway,,,"How does using an object database exclude transactions?  Transactions make as much sense for rows in a database as they do for objects in a database or even objects in memory.  Atomic object graph mutations are an essential feature of any concurrent system.  It just won't work any other way.<p>The reason to use an ORM instead of an object database is twofold.  One, it's safer to use a working database and put some libraries on top of it than it is to write your own database.  Do <i>you</i> want to write unit tests for the deadlock detection algorithm?  Two, sometimes you're writing an online transaction processing application (99% of web applications) with fixed domain objects, but you want the flexibility to slice-and-dice the data in the future.  In that case, an ORM makes your relational database look like an object store to the application (which is exactly what it wants), but it also lets you play with the data in Excel if you want to.  The key is not that the data is relational, but that it's in a standard format that other software understands.<p>Ultimately, there are three kinds of applications that you can write.  One is what most software is; the user interacts with the application and generates state along the way and you want to record that state and act upon it.  In that case, an object database is perfect; the state is meaningless without the application, so there's no reason to encode the state so as to be meaningful to other applications.  The next case is something like this but where the data might be useful outside the application (auditing, reporting, other features).  In that case, ORM is exactly what you need.  Your application wants objects, but the other things that need the data want it in a database.  So you compromise and store it in a database, using an ORM to make the relational database look like an object store to your application.  The third case is an application that is not particularly interactive (think credit-card processing network), and you don't need any app-specific state to be preserved.  In that case, raw database access is perfect; if all you are doing is INSERT INTO transactions VALUES ('jrockway', 'amazon.com', '19.95'), the ORM is just going to waste your time.",1316304619
3009139,comment,2982256,2991770,1,0,Andi,,,"I explicitly support Brendan's arguments. Programming languages are a STANDARD to help people COMMUNICATE units of functionality. If we frequently invent new languages that just mainly give us a new ""style"" to do things (and of course some will do this better, and others will do that better), we get an unnecessary chaos of different codebases that will be incompatible to each other but yet do basically the same. (1)
Language design implies even more responsibility in versioning and adaptation to new programming paradigms than API design.
Let me again cite Atwood's Law: ""Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript."" (see <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/08/all-programming-is-web-programming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/08/all-programming-is-...</a> )
It doesn't matter that much in which language a program is written, as long as the language level fits the level of your module / application and portabiliy (1) is high.
I would even vote against a separate module type and other experiments that complicate JS sytax. But this is, of course, another discussion. What I like and heavily use is CoffeeScript. 
Thank you Brandon for keeping things in order!",1316304593

Because the definition is tied to CPI, which is tied to housing costs, which are more likely to include the cost of a full kitchen now than in the past <i>especially</i> for people near the bottom.  I would argue that for someone in that position, having a full kitchen is better than not.  Yet the CPI-based measure treats the <i>cost</i> of having a full kitchen as a negative (inflation), without treating the <i>benefit</i> of the full kitchen as a positive!<p>You keep misrepresenting my position (and asking questions that depend on your misrepresentation).  I'm not saying that people now are not poor.  I'm not saying the CPI-adjusted threshold is ""wrong"" for defining who is poor.  What I'm saying is that people who are poor now and people who were poor in the past are not directly, numbers-to-numbers comparable.  It's meaningless to say that 1.2% more people are poor now than then, because there are <i>meaningful, relevant differences</i> in conditions between now and then that account for far more than a 1.2% difference.  The noise washes out the signal.",1316304459

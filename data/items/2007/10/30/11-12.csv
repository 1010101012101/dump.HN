It's a classic example of why so many people are heading off to do their own thing.  Nice, eh?  ""8 million for me...  10K for you.""<p>Imagine it's your company, your idea, your co-founder and you stay up late for weeks, you incorporate, you structure 8M shares each, and 2M aside to ""dole out"" to hire in people.<p>How much do you give your employees as you hire them?<p>Do you give them a bunch of equity ""out of the goodness of your heart""?<p>Or do you do the Socratic thing and ask them, ""what would it take?""  Or make your best guess at what it would take?<p>Or do you believe in ensuring long-term motivation of strong employees, and give them a worthy amount?  What if they turn out to be an underperformer?<p>On one hand, you could argue that ideas are cheap -- execution is hard.  On the other, plenty of people don't have many ideas, and need a leader to show them the way and press them to excel.  I claim that the real challenge is to both have a great idea, and to execute well, and even if you do that, chances of failure are still very high.<p>If you're not happy with the level of equity, look elsewhere.<p>If you don't have confidence and respect and faith in the founders, look elsewhere.<p>If you're surprised that the founders are doing a poker-table-style ""8M for me, 10K for you..."", pulling a huge pile toward themselves and giving you the small peanut pile...  get used to it, buddy.",1193743650

I was interested in a particular type of technology, and ended up with company to sell/train/install/etc in that industry.<p>Another time, a friend asked me to build them a POS system.  Then they recommended me to another friend, and then again.  Soon I realized that most affordable POS software for small businesses sucked, so I put several elements together into an affordable networked POS package of my own.<p>One of the things I'm developing now is along the lines of an XaaS (X as a Service) play to an industry that is another hobby of mine.",1193743387

74158,comment,73967,73971,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""The advantage is that you would have complete freedom in what you do.""<p>Unless what you want the freedom to do is make a reasonable amount of money.  I'm not saying don't do it, if you want to be able to work a bit more on projects you love--I've done it several times, and don't regret the time spent or the low figures earned.<p>""It's not like you are working for anyone.""<p>Here you're wrong.  You're working for everyone that sends you a dime, and they will let you know it, too.  Open Source users who've been asked to pay are among the most entitled software users on the planet--more even than Open Source users, in general--I'm a (happy) Open Source developer of 8 years, and I've done several ransomware projects and I think it's a great way to get things done...but don't imagine that your users will be particularly nice when you ignore them.<p>So, by the definitions of many of the folks here at news.yc, it's not a viable business model.  Actually, by almost anyones definition, it's not a viable business model.  But, it is a fun way to work on projects and make a little pocket money.  If you can make the project profitable in other ways simultaneously, like writing a book about it, writing articles for magazines or a popular blog, providing high end services to deep-pocketed corporate customers, etc. you can make a living...I know many people who've done just that, including myself for several years.  But you won't get rich and you won't be without a boss--you'll have dozens of bosses.",1193742779

We made about $10000 total over the span of about a year...and a big part of that was due to my existing relationships with ISPs and hosting providers that desperately wanted a non-cPanel solution to the problem.  Very little of it came from people I wasn't already doing thousands of dollars a year in business with.",1193742215

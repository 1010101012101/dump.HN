I love that I can whip out a 2-file application in Sinatra --- one file for the Ruby and templates, and another for the jQ js that'll run on the client.""<p>Yeah, I love that about Ramaze as well. :)<p>""What does Ramaze do better than Sinatra for me?""<p>Appears to be faster (at least in some simple benchmarks I ran). Choice of templating language may be key.<p>Has a better-sized set of robust standard helpers, should you want to load them.<p>More built-in adapters for a wide variety of template engines (Haml, Ezamar, Liquid, Markaby, others)<p>Unbeatable community on irc (#ramaze on freenode)<p>Way cooler shirts and coffee cups: <a href=""http://www.cafepress.com/rubystuff/4904578"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cafepress.com/rubystuff/4904578</a>  ;)<p>Whether or not any of this works out as ""better"" for anyone is hard to say.    I like that Sinatra doesn't dump a ton of must-load crap on you just to get started, but neither does rolling a plain Rack app.    Or Ramaze, for that matter.<p>It's also nice to have a reliable set of built-in libs to pull from, and as best I can see there's a stronger choice in Ramaze.<p>But, to be honest, Sinatra just never showed enough value to me to  dig into all it's possibilities, so I may be wrong in my observations.",1253077089

Not all bars are 21 y/o and over only, usually only the ones that are strictly bars or nightclubs have that restriction.

If it's so innovation-free, why does a service like RedBeacon not exist yet?<p>And if it's not so simple, then wouldn't it require innovation to build the platform and the marketing to make it all gel?<p>I don't know if these guys can pull it off. But if they do, they <i>will</i> need a lot of <unsexy> innovation.",1253076573

And you have to have special licenses to play the song online vs on a radio, etc. Its all insane.

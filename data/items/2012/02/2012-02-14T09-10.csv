Embedded systems wanting to use Linux have mostly had to do their own solution (Android, qtopia before that) because X11 was to heavy.<p>Changing Screen resolutions on the fly (think: ""projector being connected"") still is a lottery, mutli-monitor support usually requires a lot of manual intervention, bad drivers still can cause X11 to crash and take everything else with it, there are still graphical glitches when the system is busy.<p>For years - heck - decades, Linux distributions have tried to make this work, but I think that we are now at a point where everybody agrees that it can't be fixed within the framework of X11.<p>So the question is: ""is clunky behavior good enough? Is being forced to use completely different technology on mobile devices (= less code sharing) good enough?""<p>While the answer was yes 5 years ago, it's not longer true and that's why I'd give Wayland more chances now.",1329213336

But I trust Chris Okasaki on this one, and to me, his experiment counts as strong evidence against semicolons and brackets.  (Specifically, semicolons and brackets are error-prone, especially for beginners.)<p>Now for Javascript, I'd probably write the semicolons.  Because there <i>is</i> some ambiguity in the way we humans would parse Javascript without semicolons.  But really, the root of the problem is that Javascript's syntax is suboptimal.  Sure, Dennis Ritchie didn't know better at the time he wrote C, but this is no longer an excuse.<p>If I had a say, I'd simply write an alternative syntax with mandatory indentation.  It's not hard[1].  If Bootsrap's maintainer dislike semicolons so much, he probably should do so as well.

3589363,comment,3589029,3589261,4,0,newhouseb,,,"> the variation of first having everyone brainstorm alone, then combining and grouping the outcomes<p>This. A thousand times this.<p>I find the biggest common issue with brainstorming is that you end up with an incoherent amalgamation of things that people think are individually important.  People have a hard time evaluating options unless they are part of a coherent whole.  Brainstorming beforehand, alone, allows them to figure out what's important and then imagine a coherent story around that thought.  Otherwise you end up with solutions that technically contain individual important details but make no coherent sense as a whole.  It's like saying ""well, Suzie like dragons and Jimmy like potatoes so we put them together in a story.""  If Suzie had brainstormed before she could propose a backstory and context that the group finds more compelling than Jimmy's context about potatoes and they could have a more fruitful discussion than ""I don't like potatoes,"" or ""Dragons are dangerous.""<p>Edit: Now that I think about it, this might be at the core of what the article describes as the optimum collaborative environment for innovating - people who exist separately and have their own coherent problems and solutions to worry about such that when combined they lead to even more innovative solutions for problems they didn't initially realize had any overlap.",1329212863

There was a brief period, roughly coincident with the Apollo space program, when rockets were cool and so were rocket scientists. Since then, the public image of science and scientists in America has been in decline.<p>I believe that religion plays a strong role here. Religious dogma is threatened by scientific knowledge, and nowhere in the developed Western world has the backlash been as strong as in the US, which also happens to be the most religious of Western prosperous democracies. What's worse, the anti-science campaign of the religious is smashingly successful: only 40% of Americans give credence to biology's strongest and most useful theory, that of Evolution.

It really depends what you consider: wages / welfare / freedom of expression / perceived happiness, etc... It's hard to compare two different countries unless you take a look at a bunch of criteria.<p>One thing I would add, though: you cannot judge a country's current success by the politicians currently in charge. For all you know, they may not be the ones responsible for the current situation and may just benefit from what was done years ago. Economics trends are very much happening on the long term, you would not see a net difference in a few years of policy (unless something very drastic is done).

The music industry handed, well, the music industry to Apple on a plate.  The wider media watched, learned and face slapped.<p>Apple and Google are far too powerful for the media to hand any more of that kind of control to.  Watch how Google really is struggling to get industry partnership with Google Music.<p>With Hulu we saw major players (NBC, ABC and Fox) come together and build out a solution themselves.<p>My guess is that any future internet-based ""TV subscription service"" will come from a similar joint venture.

I spent most of my weekend getting it on its feet again.<p>the thing is:  I spend perhaps 1/10 as much time dicking around with my system now as I did when I was running Ubuntu on a Thinkpad.  and more of the system works more of the time.  I think most of this is down to Macs and OSX being a much less diverse environment.  the hardware is well defined, the OS releases are far fewer and thus more defined etc.<p>that being said:  when things go wrong on a Mac it is much more of a pain to sort things out.  it is much easier to find solutions online for Linux problems -- and Linux is much easier to diagnose.

But the following pictures are really not offensive at all. The next  picture is of a woman molesting <i>me</i> (in a pretty PG way). Then there is a picture of a man kissing me. The last picture is of a monkey. That seems pretty harmless by most standards.

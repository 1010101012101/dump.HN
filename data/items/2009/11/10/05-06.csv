932536,comment,931894,932523,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I don't think the problem with software patents exists solely in the fundamental difference between hardware and software. I think the problem arises from a number of things including the number of software inventors (nearly every programmer at one time or another) and the abstract nature of software. These things tend to mean that inventions are far more likely to coinvented than copied in the world of software.<p>An enforcement of the level of nonobviousness needed in software patents to make them useful for society would just about ban them outright anyway.",1257832568

932523,comment,931894,931894,0,0,hristov,,,"Here is one of those rare stories in hacker news where I can claim special expertise. But yeah, I am a patent lawyer, so everyone listen to me :)<p>I should point out that this case does not directly concern software patents. The patent at question is not a software patent but a business method patent. It was a patent for a commodity trading strategy that as claimed did not require a computer or software to execute (i.e., it could have been executed by a human without the aid of a computer).<p>Now why does everyone say that software patents are on trial? Well, many people, especially those that want to see software patents invalidated, hope that either (i) the supreme court will make an anti-patent ruling that is broad enough to cover software patents or (ii) even if they do not invalidate software patents, the supreme court will recite some kind of reasoning that will be used thereafter to attack software patents.<p>But any effect on software patents from this case will be indirect. The supreme court usually does not like to rule on things that are not properly in front of it. So their decision here will not stray from the matter at hand which is business method patents.<p>In my opinion, the supreme court should affirm the federal circuit in rejecting business method patents. I think it is common sense that patents should be limited to technology one way or another. But regarding to software -- I agree with pg that there really isn't anything special about software that is not applicable to hardware, and there is no reason to single software out. When people complain about software patents, they usually complain about obvious patents, and that is an issue sometimes. But the way to solve this is make sure the patent office applies the obviousness laws better and not by wholesale invalidation of all software patents.",1257831778

It doesn't mention a pilot, let alone an order of six episodes. It says there's a writer, a co-writer, a producer, and a press release. That's all just paper, and precious little paper so far. The sunk cost of this for the network could literally range all the way down to: The cost of printing out that press release.<p>(Because, believe me, if you're an aspiring screenwriter and a studio calls and offers to read your spec script, put out a press release, introduce you to a producer whose name you've actually <i>heard</i>, and pay you as little as <i>one nickel</i>, you <i>take</i> that call. Because having a studio on the other end of a phone line may be all you need to get an <i>agent</i>, who will not only help you negotiate your way up to <i>fifty whole bucks</i> above union scale, but will also probably shop your next script or two around.

6357602,comment,6357317,6357519,2,0,Achshar,,,"Not only is it easier to get neat results in JS but it has a very low barrier to entry. Everyone uses the internet and is just a shortcut away from executing javascript code in console of their favorite browser on a live page. That and the language itself is very &quot;loose&quot; when it comes to rules and strictness. It just gets the work done. Nothing like cpp for example. Now it can be both good thing because the results are easy and instantaneous and a bad thing because this gives a false notion to newcomers of how programing is done (but then again js is pretty ubiquitous on any modern computer, so it is as &quot;real world&quot; as it gets.)",1378778308

It was the network/IT guy that taught the class. He was really cool and a pretty damn good teacher, but I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;d be able to spot harassment like this or do anything about it.

Surely a lot of people would take the government up on that offer, and instead of being productive taxpayers, contributing to the economy and to the treasury, they&#x27;ll sit around playing XBox.

Why should the teacher have any notice of her?<p>The extent of the problem is that some people said things like &quot;go make me a sammich&quot; etc to her daughter. I would suggest that this is actually not a huge problem. I recall my days in high school, when I was beaten up on a regular basis for the sin of being good at Math and Science. I mean hard punches to the head and body, possessions destroyed, etc. I spite of my complaints to parents and teachers alike, nothing was done until I managed to create some bad publicity for the school. But it seems it only hatters if it happens to a girl (TM).<p>Bear in mind also that the salary of the teacher is probably around 60% of the salary that a production programmer can earn. So unless the teacher is a very idealistic soul, it is likely the teacher is struggling and knows little about programming. Which makes the teacher&#x27;s job all the more difficult.<p>Finally, there is no proof any of this actually happened. Given past feminist false claims, it is quite on the cards that it didn&#x27;t happen or is exaggerated... particularly given the acknowledgement that she did nothing about the problem when it counted.",1378777825

6357561,comment,6355936,6357065,6,0,msandford,,,"Yeah that&#x27;s a really good point!<p>I&#x27;ve heard plenty of people talk about working their way through school by having a summer job to pay for room and board and tuition and that it was possible to do it that way, even if it was uncomfortable.  That really sounds great but maybe a little bit too great: it&#x27;s a good narrative about how things were better back in the olden days when things were still good and not fucked up.  I WANT to believe it but I&#x27;m not sure that I should.  And it&#x27;s all anecdote, no data.<p>I did some searching for pricing and I found this: <a href=""http://www.collegeview.com/admit/?p=1858"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegeview.com/admit/?p=1858</a>  It looks like a decent summary.  In 1960 the minimum wage was $1.00/hr and the cheapest tuition I&#x27;m seeing is $960 for the University of Texas.  If you made minimum wage for three months of summer that&#x27;s a total of 40 * 4 * 3 * $1 = $480 pre-tax.  So definitely not enough to pay for a whole year of school from just the summer job.  At an Ivy League school you&#x27;re at about 1/4 of your yearly total.<p>Today if you work a minimum wage job for a whole summer you&#x27;d get 40 * 4 * 3 * $7.25 = $3480 (pre-tax of course) which wouldn&#x27;t even pay for your tuition (nevermind room and board and other expenses, that&#x27;s another $5k per year at least) at the University of Florida, arguably the best deal in college tuition in the last decade.  Comparing it to an Ivy League these days, it&#x27;s not the 25% it used to be but rather about 10% if you go to one of the cheaper schools.",1378777764

I think that makes up, at least a little, of the time lost in not having as mature of a curriculum.<p>But I think the big win with JS is opportunity. Whatever crappy program they might come up with, they can immediately show it to their classmates and also to any friends or family with a simple link...it&#x27;s not quite as easy to distribute a VB or other compiled executable. This kind of sharing makes programming...I would think...much more dynamic and lively.<p>And in addition to that, they get some web development experience...which is handy now and likely to be useful in 5 years.

6357491,comment,6357317,6357424,24,0,spamizbad,,,"My Programming I class was taught by a math teacher (who  was an excellent <i>algebra</i> instructor). Unfortunately he was only a chapter ahead of the class in computer programming. But that wasn&#x27;t the worst part. For guidance, he turned to his brother-in-law, who was a manager of developers at Motorola. He stated as much the first day of class, boasting &quot;You&#x27;re going to have the rare treat of learning how programming is done in the <i>real world</i>!&quot;<p>All the joy of programming was quickly sucked out as we had to meticulously document our code. Sub routines needed 2-3 paragraph plain-English explanations of what they were doing. Each variable&#x27;s purpose needed to be stated. And before you could write a single line of code, you first had to write it out in a form of &quot;pseudo code&quot; which had its own syntax rules that we had to follow. Lots of emphasis was placed on the <i>process</i> of what we should be doing instead of the <i>how</i> and <i>why</i>. Students struggled.<p>I understand what he was trying to do: having us write everything out gave him a window into how our minds were breaking down the problem. But in the process, he turned what should have been a fun, exploratory class into a grind.<p>The notion that programming could be a <i>fun</i> activity, and not just mindless, process-driven office work was completely foreign to him, and I suspect the same is true for many teachers who are stuck teaching Programming classes in both public and private schools.<p>Edit:\nAnd on the issue of gender, my class had 25 students, 11 of whom were girls. I remember being amazed at how a programming class could have a 50/50 ratio. I didn&#x27;t notice anyone being bullied or teased. I imagine once women reach &quot;critical mass&quot; women won&#x27;t be singled-out to the same degree. A few bad apples or even a sexist teacher can&#x27;t &quot;single out&quot; 44% of their class. Why were there so girls enrolled? I don&#x27;t know, but the class did have a reputation for being an easy A, so perhaps it was viewed as less intimidating.",1378776928

Not in a public way to name a few kids, but work with the teacher in a very constructive way (such as bringing in more women to talk about tech industry. That&#x27;s better than bringing a man in.... if you want to show women can do the job too).<p>We don&#x27;t know much about how the kid actually behaved in the classroom so we really shouldn&#x27;t blame the teacher too much at the moment. What we need to realize is poor communication among the kid, the mother and the teacher. It&#x27;s tough because half of the parents don&#x27;t use email or they don&#x27;t have time to talk to the kids or speak with the teacher reguarly. PTA is usually dead with a couple parents from time to time.<p>So the mother should learn her mistake, help reconstruct her daughter&#x27;s confident and stop making her rants public now. It&#x27;s not helping. It is sort of one-side if I had to be really harsh (you can downvote me if you want), but that&#x27;s how I feel as I read through the post again and again.<p>Also, please, please, be careful when your daughter adds people she is still not very familiar with to her FB.",1378776260

A man can make an agreement with another man or perhaps even with an organization that is capable of coherent action, but Google is neither.  No &quot;agreement&quot; with Google is valid if only because Google is not a collective that one can actually negotiate with, never mind that it&#x27;s proven time and time again willing to discard agreements and promises in the name of profit.<p>Finally, the statement is often made that if one chooses not to consider Google as an entity with which one can negotiate, one should simply not utilize their resources.

The more binaries you have to be able to subvert for it to work, the harder the attack becomes. There are lots of binary diff tools out there, lots of compilers, lots of assemblers, etc. Writing an attack that could detect them all and defeat them all would be so hard as to be impractical; being able to generically recognize something like &quot;this is a compiler&quot; or &quot;this is an implementation of AES&quot; would probably involve solving the halting problem. And if you can&#x27;t solve it generically, you have to start adding bigger and bigger suspicious binary blobs in which encode all of the patterns for all of the programs you&#x27;re looking to subvert.<p>Remember, the NSA does not have infinite resources, nor can they solve unsolveable problems. There is a practical limit to how paranoid you need to be.<p>Practically, subverting general purpose computation, like subverting a compiler or subverting general purpose instructions on a CPU, is likely to be too easy to detect and too hard to implement to be worth it.<p>Much easier is subverting a random number generator. That&#x27;s incredibly hard to detect, and easy to implement. AES encrypting an incrementing counter with a key known only to the NSA looks an awful lot like a random stream, but with that key they can trivially figure out where it is in the stream and what will come next.<p>That&#x27;s why Intel&#x27;s insistence on getting the Linux kernel to blindly trust the RdRand instruction was quite worrying[1], while applying only a bit of paranoia and using David A Wheeler&#x27;s approach to defeat the trusting trust attack[2] is likely sufficient to have faith in things like your compiler.<p>1: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RdRand"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RdRand</a>\n2: <a href=""http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/</a>",1378775489

I consider myself pretty open minded about gender diversity...but as I was reading the OP&#x27;s post, I completely assumed it was written by a programmer-father, until I got to the part where the OP describes being harassed.

Unfortunately, I think women in tech still have the much more difficult task of fighting pervasive, subconscious stereotyping and assumptions in the industry.<p>edit: 3.

What makes Lisp so powerful is that these data structures are lists and lists are used all the time; this enables a large amount of code sharing between macros and regular functions.<p>Now this makes it very straightforward to evaluate the usefulness of Julia&#x27;s claim of homoiconicity: how often would you expect to use the data structures Julia uses to represent its expression trees?

I don&#x27;t think any article is going to change an individual&#x27;s preference though collectively enough of these could sway an industry&#x27;s management attitude. The fact that we see mostly articles opposing remote work tells me that they aren&#x27;t written objectively.<p>I&#x27;m with the Woz quote. My preference has always been to be completely async other than perhaps one pre-scheduled meeting per day if necessary. It&#x27;s not always practical but it&#x27;s an ideal.",1378774889

I suppose I viewed it like an old school hardcore/punk fanzine in which the purpose is not to blow minds or push boundaries necessarily but to express and share an affinity for something you are passionate about.

We didn&#x27;t approve this update and its not in the qualified release notes that were distributed.<p>Unfortunately with a complete system app that requires dedicated workstations, you can&#x27;t keep up with the latest and greatest right away.<p>We skipped windows 8 and are evaluating windows 8.1<p>If you are making a massive system app, customers shouldn&#x27;t have expectation it would work on versions/updates not specified as per a contractual obligation.<p>If you are simply making addons, you should be in constant communication with the vendor so you support X if they are going to support X. Otherwise you gonna lose business... \nWe have 3rd party vendors that are being dropped in our new release because they don&#x27;t support it yet.\nFor the big players we are working with them so we are going live with them<p>I&#x27;m not sure I could complain, but we are a super vendor with all the privileges, we are still about 6-12months behind MS releases at least.<p>Its all about setting expectations.

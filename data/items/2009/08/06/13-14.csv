745445,comment,743607,744381,0,0,warfangle,,,"Well, if the jQuery library is loaded (file-wise), and nothing is used from it - well, nothing should init.<p>What I profiled as taking that long was the jQuery init functions, which I assumed were required (and called by) the plugin.<p>Then again, I'm not as familiar with jQuery as I once was. All I know is that I don't like method chaining (impossible to set mid-line breakpoints and try/catch blocks), the extended element (if it's anything like prototype) is extremely heavy and not needed a majority of the time, and if you use massive amounts of it (see: slashdot) the user experience is deleteriously affected.<p>And really, 500ms initialization (even if it's jQuery and not the plugin initializing, that's a long time) for a user-experience-worsening toy like this.. I don't see the point.",1249567096

Only this time it won't work, there are 100's of little side roads now, and you no longer have to use the 'main' road to get the news you are looking for.<p>People used to be 'loyal' to their newspapers, that's why the payments rolled in. That loyalty is very low, as long as the writing is good I really don't care whether I'm reading my stuff in German, French, English or Dutch and from what newspaper or other outlet it comes. So many choices, it's a delight. The AP feed relaying to fill the newspapers was a clever idea to save some money at the time but in the long term it backfired, it meant that there was less reporting in general, not that the reporters that were freed up were used to go digging.<p>It's only a matter of time before google or some other large party will hire a bunch of reporters directly and gets them to make the missing element (quality editorial content) and with the trouble at the regular newspapers I'm thinking that it will be a buyers market when they do.",1249567091

I'm not going to suggest what is next, but I know it won't have annoying profile pages where users can list endless and pointless information about favorite TV shows, movies, books, etc.  I have noticed that a lot of people have stopped filling in static profile data, or greatly shortened what they had - Gen-y moves fast and is too dynamic to be labeled/pigeonholed with static data.<p>Another idea that I have for the future of social networking is that it will open up again, or become less private. The problem with facebook is that it has become a glorified rolodex where you can list and keep track of everyone you know, but you don't find or meet anyone new, anymore, because everyone has private profiles.  Thus, the only people you friend are old classmates, relatives, or people you meet in the ""real-world"".  It used to be the opposite, I used to friend new people all the time by searching networks with like interests or by stumbling onto people through friends of friends. People will either need to loosen up, or use virtual aliases so that people can actually network and find other like-minded friends on ""social"" networks, again.",1249566384

Ritual removed all the power plugs. Four Barrel purposely does not have wifi. Same with the newer Blue Bottle in Mint Plaza. Certain cafes like Sugarlump and that one in Bernal which I forgot the name have very bad wifi that they do not fix, on purpose, to limit the number of laptop users. Mami Tobi's in Hayes Valley also does not have wifi, on purpose.<p>All the coffee shops in the Inner Richmond charge for Wifi, except for Martha Bros, which doesn't have any reasonable seating.<p>Reverie in Cole Valley removed the wifi years ago. Oddly enough the wifi removal was initiated by Craig Newmark.<p>Unfortunately in cities like SF or ""college towns"" the free wifi in cafes is severely abused. People will buy the cheapest cup of coffee and then sit there for 8 hours. When I lived in Cambridge, it was impossible to sit at the 1369 coffee shop at any time during the day because the seating was completely taken up by laptop lurkers. They ended up moving to paid wifi to fix the situation. Ritual in SF is crowded enough even with no power plugs. When they had the power plugs, the laptop usage there was ridiculous.<p>At this point in time the only draw of many of the coffee shops with wifi in SF is actually the wifi itself. For instance, Mission Creek Cafe has awful coffee, food and service. The only reason anyone goes there is because there are power outlets and wifi.<p><i>Any coffee shop that limits or bans internet usage will quickly loose trade to those that embrace it</i><p>Coffee shops lose money on heavy wifi users. Laptop lurkers are usually students and freelancers - people who take up space and don't spend much money. Coffee shops make money by... selling coffee. The coffee shop that has done the best financially in San Francisco is Blue Bottle, which not only didn't have wifi, it didn't have a physical space.

Then in doing so, you'll search the web and come across predictive modeling, which will lead to machine learning techniques, which will lead to good resources.  Within those machine learning sources, search for chapters on prediction and classification, and you'll come across regression techniques, support vector machines, relevance vector machines, etc.  Then you'll wonder, ""ok, how do I actually solve this problem"" so you may search for ""SVM implementations"" and find Steve Gunn's for Matlab for example.  Then after much codebanging, you'll realize that inorder to solve this problem, you need a good dataset, so you go to Yahoo finance and see if you can download some data for IBM.<p>This is usually the process one needs to follow, albeit with some intermediate steps switched out for others here and there.",1249564998

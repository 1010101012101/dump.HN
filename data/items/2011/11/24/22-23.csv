This happens on practically every page of Hacker News: there's some five-word blurb describing a piece of software that might be interesting, but the link just dumps you into the repo view on Github. Gee, thanks. No, I'm not going to spend half an hour digging through your code trying to figure out what it does! I wish people would link to a page that actually explains what they are trying to do and why it is interesting.",1322175580

3275645,comment,3275014,3275183,8,0,GHFigs,,,"I think the issue here is the language used. The research usually describes things in such a way that ""rational = maximizing"" and and the phenomena cataloged are ""errors"" or ""biases"" that make human behavior fall short of maximizing. So, you could easily come away with the impression that ""irrational = always wrong"" or ""irrational = bad"", but what is really meant is that ""irrational = not maximizing"".<p>Temporal discounting is just something we do. It's a heuristic[1] sometimes gives good results, sometimes doesn't. <i>When</i> it doesn't, the redditor suggests, that's what we call procrastination. When it works well, we generally don't even notice, because it seems so natural.<p><i>Procrastination often has no reward at all. If it has a reward, why call it procrastionation? You actually do something useful, if it has a reward.</i><p>That's setting a higher bar for ""reward"" than what is meant. Pleasurable activities like watching television or playing video games are ""rewarding"". That's why people do them. That's why people continue doing them even when they ""have more important things to do"". Yes, in the end, you might not get anything material out of them, but if it truly had ""no reward at all"", nobody would do them.<p><i>losing $100 might feel as bad, as winning $200 might feel good</i><p>That's known as ""loss aversion"", another cut from Kahneman & Tversky's Greatest Hits.<p><i>But if you think about that risk again for this point in time + one year it is not that unlikely anymore.</i><p>Notice that you say <i>if you think about...</i>. When people procrastinate, are they really <i>thinking</i> of those sorts of things. Suppose you're a student that has a paper due soon and opt to play video games instead. You'd probably be thinking something like ""I'll play games now and do the paper later."" rather than something like ""I might die before the end of term, so why bother with the paper?""<p>That's not to say you're wrong: only to bring it back to the original context.<p>[1]: A heuristic, in other words, being a way of ""avoiding cost"" of doing the rational (maximizing) computation. So it's not really different from what you're saying.",1322175413

At the time, HSBC's online banking had the following flow: Enter your user ID as the first step, enter your DOB as the second, and finally enter three specified digits from your 6-figure security PIN.<p>It all seemed OK to me, nothing out of the ordinary, but he was telling me that when he was prompted to enter his security PIN, the site asked for the full number. This was a big no-no.<p>""So I thought I'd better call you before I do that, because it doesn't sound right and you know about this stuff.""<p>I went to their house the next weekend to check it out. He fired up the ol' IE7, went to the HSBC page, completed the first step of logging in, and there it was, clear as day. A mysterious third box prompting the user to enter their full PIN.<p>I don't know exactly what put that input box there, and successive Googling has yielded nothing specific. I assumed the damn thing had picked up some nasty spyware, or some other malicious code with the potential to cost a lot of people an awful lot of money. I installed Chrome, deleted the ""Internet"" icon from the desktop, imported old bookmarks and the like, and let him have a go on his new browser.<p>I really think we, as the more technically-minded people in our families, have an obligation to do this for the people we care about, in a way that extends far beyond those clever CSS animations or native video support. I'm lucky enough that my folks know to keep their eyes open to anything fishy online, but I had no idea he was still using IE7.

I've paid lots of money for proprietary applications. I've released source under a variety of licenses (including GPL, proprietary and BSDish) and feel that they each have their place. I <i>do</i> feel much better using open source stuff because I know the rug is never going to be pulled out from under me (which happened recently with some proprietary scanner software I bought a few years ago).<p><i>BUT</i>, I do think you can objectively measure ""freedom"" as it relates to software. The people who tend to complain about the GPL being ""restrictive"" are people that want to take code and release something proprietary. From their perspective the license is forbidding them to do what they want to do and is therefore restricive. But that's only considering themselves and not the people they are releasing the program to which is why I characterized it as ""selfish"". I think if you step back and look at <i>why</i> the GPL requires you to distribute the source with your binaries it is obvious that they are trying to give your customers the same freedoms you had. That objectively increases the amount of freedom in the whole software ecosystem.<p>> If you don't understand that's fine, but I am absolutely not restricted by the proprietary software that I choose to use.<p>Yeah, you are restricted--You are not allowed to compile up the source to your legitimately purchased Photoshop.

I also bought them for full price on the recommendations of friends.<p>I don't have a vacuum of time that I'm trying to fill with more games. The reason that Indie Button Masher isn't worth $15 to me anymore is because I have so many other high-quality games to spend my time on. There are occasional shining examples (like Magicka) are were well-worth the full $20 + whatever else I spent on DLC for them, but I bought them because my friends recommended them and assured me that they were worth my time and money, not because it was on a Steam sale.<p>If there's a game I kinda want, I'll wait on a Steam sale for it, but not because I'm being cheap, but because I have plenty of other games to play in the meantime. If there's a title that I <i>really</i> want, I'll buy it outright for full price.

They work very differently.<p>If you have heat from friction you expect the heat along the length of the ship.<p>If you have heat from compression you expect it at any point where the ship is not parallel to the air - but not along the length of it.<p>Heat from friction can be aided by a low friction surface material.<p>Heat from compression can be aided by not having any surface very perpendicular to the air (spread out the change in angle over a distance).<p>With heat from friction you want a short ship - so just have the angled surface and be done with it.<p>Heat from compression would benefit from a longer ship so you have space to gradually change the angle of a surface.",1322172368

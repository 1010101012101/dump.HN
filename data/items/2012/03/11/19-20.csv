They abuse their power and treat their marketplace sellers like crap.<p>If you have any major problems with your Amazon marketplace seller account, you have no phone support and can't really talk to anyone besides someone that emails you automated cookie-cutter responses and signs it with a name.<p>I think this is because they are hiring workers from India at a cheaper rate (The little phone support they do have for customers is from India).<p>Customers can also scam you very easily.  As an example, if they have any problems with the item that you sold them and they file an A-Z claim, 9/10 times, Amazon will just give them their money back and not require the customer to actually return the item.  You have no option to ban scammers and once they place an order with you (even if you cancel it), they can leave you negative feedback (which can and will get you kicked off).<p>The only reason they are getting away with this is because they know they are one of only two marketplaces with the most traffic.<p>If you are thinking about doing business with Amazon, think again.",1331495437

Did, at some point, scientists calculate when the sun was exactly overhead Greenwich and call that noon? Because I would think that that calculation would have a multi-second error, so setting your clock to the second would be pointless.<p>Or maybe there is no such thing as ""actual physical time"" and there is only what people have agreed to call the standard. But in that case why do time sources, such as time.gov and time.windows.com, still give different times? I would think Microsoft would have fixed any bugs in their NTP implementation by now, so it's not that. If it's just politics about nobody wanting to move to someone else's time, then there's no way to tell which source is the real standard, so your most practical choice is to synchronize your clock to the times you deal with. That is, set your clock to your clock at work, or an average of your friends clocks, or whatever source they get their time from. I don't mind the existence of central time sources, because they are better than having to go out and find someone else's clock, but they shouldn't call themselves official if they aren't actually official.<p>So, does anybody know how the starting time for central time sources is chosen, and if any source is worthy of being called ""the real time""?",1331493746

3690995,comment,3689676,3689676,1,0,moldbug,,,"Great comment from the Slashdot thread (direct link: <a href=""http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=557384&cid=23464230"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=557384&ci...</a>):<p>My experience has been that while in the hands of people who know what they're doing, they're a nice tool to have, well, beware managers using their output as metrics. And beware even more a consultant with such a tool that he doesn't even understand.<p>The thing is, these tools produce<p>A) a lot of ""false positives"", code which is really OK and everyone understand why it's ok, but the tool will still complain, and<p>B) usually includes some metrics of dubious quality at best, to be taken only as a signal for a human to look at it and understand why it's ok or not ok.<p>E.g., ne such tool, which I had the misfortune of sitting through a salesman hype session of, seemed to be really little more than a glorified grep. It really just looked at the source text, not at what's happening. So for example if you got a database connection and a statement in a ""try"" block, it wanted to see the close statements in the ""finally"" block.<p>Well, applied to an actual project, there was a method which just closed the connection and the statements supplied as an array. Just because, you know, it's freaking stupid to copy-and-paste cute little ""if (connection != null) { try { connection.close(); } catch (SQLException e) { // ignore }}"" blocks a thousand times over in each ""finally"" block, when you can write it once and just call the method in your finally block. This tool had a trouble understanding that it _is_ all right. Unless it saw the ""connection.close()"" right there, in the finally block, it didn't count.<p>Other examples include more mundane stuff like the tools recommending that you synchronize or un-synchronize a getter, even when everyone understands why it's OK for it to be as it is.<p>E.g., a _stateless_ class as a singleton is just an (arguably premature and unneded) speed optimization, because some people think they're saving so much by a singleton instead of the couple of cycles it takes to do a new on a class with no members and no state. It doesn't really freaking matter if there's exactly one of it, or someone gets a copy of it. But invariably the tools will make an ""OMG, unsynchronized singleton"" fuss, because they don't look deep enough to see if there's actually some state that must be unique.<p>Etc.<p>Now taken as something that each developper understands, runs on his own when he needs it, and uses his judgment of each point, it's a damn good thing anyway.<p>Enter the clueless PHB with a metric and chart fetish, stage left. This guy doesn't understand what those things are, but might make it his personal duty to chart some progress by showing how much fewer warnings he's got from the team this week than last week. So useless man-hours are spent on useless morphing perfectly good code, into something that games the tool. For each 1 real bug found, there'll be 100 harmless warnings that he makes it his personal mission to get out of the code.<p>Enter the snake-oil vendor's salesman, stage right. This guy only cares about selling some extra copies to justify his salary. He'll hype to the boss exactly the possibility to generate such charts (out of mostly false positives) and manage by such charts. If the boss wasn't already in a mind to do that management anti-pattern, the salesman will try to teach him to. 'Cause that's usually the only advantage that his expensive tool has over those open source tools that you mention.<p>I'm not kidding. I actually tried to corner one into;<p>Me: ""ok, but you said not everything it flags there is a bug, right?""<p>Him: ""Yes, you need to actually look at them and see if they're bugs or not.""<p>Me: ""Then what sense does it make to generate charts based on wholesale counting entities which may, or may not be bugs?""<p>Him: ""Well, you can use the charts to see, say, a trend that you have less of them over time, so the project is getting better.""<p>Me: ""But they may or may not be actual bugs. How do you know if this week's mix has more or less actual bugs than last weeks, regardless of what the total there is?""<p>Him: ""Well, yes, you need to actually look at them in turn to see which are actual bugs.""<p>Me: ""But that's not what the tool counts. It counts a total which includes an unknown, and likely majority, number of false positives.""<p>Him: ""Well, yes.""<p>Me: ""So what use is that kind of a chart then?""<p>Him: ""Well, you can get a line or bar graph that shows how much progress is made in removing them.""<p>Lather, rinse, repeat, give up.<p>Or enter the consultant with a tool. Now while I'll be the first to say that a lot of projects do end up needing a good consultant to get the code to perform right, I'll also warn about the thousands of parasites posing as one. There are more than enough guys who don't actually have any clue, and all they do is run the code through such a tool, and expect miracles to happen. They don't see the big fat SQL query that causes the delay, or the needless loop it's in, but they'll advise blind compliance to the 1 microsecond saving tips of their tool. And of course, again, try to justify his fee by reducing such a total of harmless warnings.<p>And I guess the moral of the story is that you also need to train the people to understand those tools, and understand what they can ignore and what not. It might mean a bit more expense than just downloading the tools. Especially training some managers what _not_ to do with them.",1331493235

The best is to ask your prospective customers.<p>2- That's a good question. Can you make something better than SEOMoz by specializing? Your initial Unique Value Proposition is that it's easier because the domain and keywords are known. However I don't see that as being much work.

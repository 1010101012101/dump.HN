No one is saying that it _can&#x27;t_ handle howevermany txs / second. But do you want it to? That is the real question.<p>Right now the network has <7000 nodes, a number that has dropped from almost 30K in the past few years. [0] The blockchain is <30GB and a node can expect to handle ~15GB/day of bandwidth. [1] You will also need at least a gig of RAM, preferably more. The UTXO is 500MB (which needs to be stored in memory).<p>So what we know is that despite the relatively low requirements of running a node, we are bleeding them faster than we can get new ones. People claim that storage space and bandwidth getting cheaper will solve the problem. Given past performance of the node landscape, that statement does not hold weight.<p>So what are the consequences of all this? Well, the node landscape will centralize very quickly as the bandwidth and storage requirements far outpace what most would be willing to provide the network gratis. Universities and large payment processors will be the only ones who can afford to run full (archival) nodes. Pruning and all that will help, sure. But in order for Bitcoin to remain true to its decentralized roots, a distributed node landscape is vital.

While this presents a danger of boring readers (such as myself) who are already familiar with DNA and meiosis, the colorful metaphors Dawkins uses throughout the book do much to keep the reading engrossing and entertaining.\nAfter a lengthy exploration of basic biology, covering topics such as DNA and the origin of life, Dawkins introduces the gene-centered view of evolution that has long been textbook orthodoxy. Dawkins uses the remainder of the book to look at various types of animal behavior in an effort to convey some general conclusions and tools to help the reader understand evolution and natural selection. Much of his effort is devoted to explaining behavior in terms of the &#x27;selfish gene&#x27; - especially social behavior that has long been held to have evolved &#x27;for the good of the species.&#x27; Dawkins shows that how fundamental axiom of natural selection (that the genes best at surviving and reproducing will eventually spread through the gene pool) leads directly to the selfish gene and the behavior exhibited by nearly all animals (humans being the prime exception).\nI should warn that conservatives would probably not enjoy the book nearly as much as I did. Dawkins is an open secular humanist with socialist leanings, and is not worried about offending the delicate sensibilities of creationists and fundamentalists. This book should only be read by those willing to &#x27;accept&#x27; the validity of natural selection and evolution; others would only waste their time. I would direct readers seeking a more scientific discussion of these issues to G. C. Williams&#x27;s &quot;Adaptation and Natural Selection.&quot; All others will most likely enjoy &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; a great deal and finish the book with a new appreciation for and understanding of evolution and biology.",1418487522

All drives I had to change because even ZFS couldn&#x27;t cope with read errors anymore had a health below 10%.<p>I&#x27;m using this for Nagios checks instead of other SMART checks as it&#x27;s more reliable and the health reporting is all you need to inspect the drive further. Never got reliable performance values out of the drives we use through. But that&#x27;s a SMART problem for certain vendors.<p>I have nothing to do with them, I just think it&#x27;s a great tool that allows watching the values named in the article quite elegant.",1418486919
8745443,comment,8742719,8743657,0,0,SharpSightLabs,,,"I also highly recommend R.<p>Dplyr and ggplot2 (noted by baldfat) are exceptional.<p>I recently wrote a tutorial on dplyr here: <a href=""http://www.sharpsightlabs.com/dplyr-intro-data-manipulation-with-r/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sharpsightlabs.com/dplyr-intro-data-manipulation-...</a><p>To put this simply, dplyr&#x27;s syntax is set up to create streamlined workflows.  All of the major data management tasks (sort, subset, group, summarize) are easy to do.  And they can be &quot;chained&quot; together (much like using pipes in Unix).<p>Ggplot (another R package) is an amazing data visualization tool.   The syntax has a deep underlying structure, based on the Grammar of Graphics theoretical framework. I won’t go into that too much, but suffice it to say, when you learn the ggplot2 syntax, you’re actually learning how to think about data visualization in a very deep way. You’ll eventually understand how to create complex visualizations without much effort.<p>GGplot and dplyr are the reason I settled on R (instead of Python).  When you use them together (again, using &quot;chaining&quot;) you can explore your data rapidly and also create really high quality analyses.",1418486916

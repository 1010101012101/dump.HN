I'm not even arguing that they are <i>wrong</i>, although I think they are. My point was perhaps unclear, but I think ESR has a philosophical problem with the idea of a society governed by an ethos of mutual responsibility and obligations. He sees that as a road to tyranny or stagnation, consistent with Ayn Rand and her intellectual descendants.<p>The GPL is about building a web of such responsibilities, explicitly to force closed-source firms to abandon their tactics and become part of a community. I get the sense that ESR finds such tactics distasteful because of his political beliefs. Which is fine! He's not alone in that.<p>The problem is that he's still claiming the GPL has held us all back by alluding to economic studies, which I'm not sure even exist. The GPL seems to have done really well by every empirical measure I know of, and it shows no signs of strangling capitalism or anything.",1237996635

531939,comment,531850,531850,0,0,jawngee,,,"Great article.<p>I suffer from PTSD, GAD and mild depression.  Having been involved in a fairly violent street gang in high school, I had seen a lot of violence and just plain f*cked up stuff.  People getting shot in front of me, a lot of situations that forced me to confront my own mortality, etc.<p>It really didn't hit me until about 10 years ago.  I was getting off the F train at 23rd street and had an overwhelming feeling I was going to pass out, which I then interpreted as my imminent death.  It was frightening because it was so out of the blue and so intense.  Who wants to pass out on a subway platform?  Or worse, die on a subway platform?<p>For the next two years I tried to find a medical reason behind that first massive panic attack, but never found one despite spending several tens of thousands of dollars on medical bills.  I finally had to accept that I had these certain mental conditions.<p>I used to reign it in through a variety of meds; anti-depressants, klonopin, ativan, xanax.  I went to a cognitive behavioral therapist to figure out how to change my thinking and learn to control it.<p>These days I don't take any meds and though I still have massive panic attacks now and again, they mostly don't phase me as they're so common place now and you sort of grow to accept that these things aren't going away and it's your lot in life.<p>The most damning aspects of anxiety disorder aren't the panic attacks, by the way.  It's all the passive shit that comes with it.  Hyper-vigilance and derealization have to be the worst.  Hyper-vigilance means that you are so focused on your physical well being that the slightest pain, discomfort, etc. gets misinterpreted as a major medical calamity.  A cough becomes lung cancer, a mild pain in your armpit becomes non-hodgkin's lymphoma, etc.  With derealization, you'll have entire spans of time where nothing seems real to you at all, familiar things become unfamiliar, etc.  If you've read anything by Camus, you'll have some understanding what derealization is all about.  It's pretty scary shit.<p>But despite all of that, I have what I consider a fairly successful career.  I believe that is partially due to the CBT therapy, and part to my stubbornness to not be a victim.<p>I do think depression and anxiety are endemic to this current generation of technologists (late 20's and up).  This new generation, seems more balanced though, so maybe it's a generational thing?  Not sure.<p>One controversial thing that has helped me, as well as hurt me, is marijuana.  Most times it helps me to get out of my head, specifically on days when the anxiety is thickest.  On the flip side, sometimes imbuing too much brings the anxiety like nothing else.  But most times, it's been more helpful than harmful.",1237996093
531938,comment,531734,531734,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I just watched the video.  Here's my summary:<p>1.  Within Eclipse, you can do a subset of the stuff that ElasticFox does.<p>2.  It can N instances of a Tomcat AMI along with an instance of a load balancer AMI automagically.<p>3.  It can deploy a war file to all N instances simultaneously.<p>4.  It can set-up remote debugging on all N instances so you don't have to worry about which machine the load balancer sent you to.<p>For me, I would find it convenient to have ElasticFox-like features inside Eclipse, but it's not a huge benefit.  The ""bring up lots of instances"" stuff is nice, but most corporate operations groups would prefer to script such things rather than have ops people clicking buttons. And, the cases where I would want to debug in a cluster are rather limited -- cross machine concurrency issues (distributed cache invalidation/replication, session replication, etc.).",1237996091

Instead of trying to determine a value for your company at the seed stage they give you money and call it a loan.  When you raise money at the A round the loan converts to a stock purchase at the amount they loaned you plus some percentage - 20% in this case, a little high but they are a brand name not some random angel.<p>For example they loan you $100k to get started.  6-9 months later you get a VC to invest $1MM at a $1MM pre-money valuation.

The scaling is especially hard since the whole web-platform is built around the request-response model.""<p>I disagree about this. There's nothing hacky/quirky about comet, and it can scale really well.
Some numbers from a Mibbit backend:<p><pre><code>  Peak connected users: 4,000
  Peak HTTP Req/s: 1,500

  HTTP requests per day: 44 million
  Packets sent per day: 42 million
  Packets recv per day: 51 million

  (On a single 1.4GB VPS). Using *OMG* java!
</code></pre>
If you're not using comet, that HTTP req figure would be way higher, as a far larger number of HTTP requests would be unuseful (no data available). Wasting time, bandwidth, etc As well as obviously adding latency. With comet, the data is available in most instances as soon as the server has it ready. With standard polling, the user has to wait for the next poll.<p>Comet is pretty easy to scale once you understand exactly what is going on, and how best to organize things. Mibbit uses a keep-alive long polling XHR setup which works really well. The keep-alive ensures that most of the time, you just have a tcp/ip connection open from server to client, with some HTTP request/response spam every so often, and the actual packets.<p>Having said that, I wouldn't use any of the open source comet things I've seen out there.<p>(I do plan to open source Mibbit at some point, which might be useful for people).",1237994264

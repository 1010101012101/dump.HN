I&#x27;m glad they settled on a syntax that wasn&#x27;t too far out of the norm from what you would expect, given PHP&#x27;s roots (i.e. Perl).  I seem to recall the RFC at some point had a different syntax, but I could be remembering incorrectly.<p><i>I&#x27;d think the mixing of associative and sequential arrays are one of the key things that lowers the barrier to entry though.</i><p>For me it fails the &quot;similar things should look similar, different things should look different&quot; test.  Then again, they aren&#x27;t really all that different in PHP.  I guess it comes down to me preferring my sequential and associative data structures to be separate, which is a fairly fundamental difference to how PHP thinks it should be.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the complexity this data structure tries to hide leaks out through the numerous functions used to interact with it[1], which just shifts the pain slightly farther down the line, and possibly from a one-time event (when learning the fundamentals) to a regular occurrence as it causes problems continually later.<p>1: <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WaterbedTheory\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WaterbedTheory</a>",1387267192

But <i>extortion</i> is more accurate.<p>>> Government = the Monopoly on Violence<p>Yes, and thoroughly immoral.<p>>> Capitalism (which is separate from the free market) = Wage Slavery and too much power<p>This is where we disagree, it seems. You seem to be referring to Crony-Capitalism, or &quot;Crapitalism&quot;. Corporations buy State power and using it to their own benefit, and of course, that will continue for as long as there is power to be bought. If there&#x27;s nothing to bribe, then <i>you can&#x27;t bribe</i>.<p>But in reality, Capitalism is just what people do in their pursuit of personal gain: voluntary exchanges, contracts, agreements, and investments, etc. All backed by respect for property rights, of course. Without property rights, there would be just about no wealth in the world, because no one could expect to benefit from any value they might produce.<p>The absence of coercion ~ a free market ~ freedom ~ Capitalism.

From a sample of their employees we have: <i>Information Theory</i>, karnaugh maps, the transistor, laser, photovoltaics, CCDs, C,R, Unix and for kicks - stumbling upon CMB hence enriching our understanding of the universe, it&#x27;s age and size. It&#x27;s mind boggling. No company today comes anywhere near that in terms of fundamentally rearranging knowledge and society.<p>I would argue that if Bell Labs was 8 or 9 on the Richter Scale then Microsoft Research, at a 4 or 5, is the closest we have today in terms of independence and diversity of research unfettered by profit concerns.<p>One guess for why Bell Labs was able to achieve so much is that on one hand they had decades of fundamental new insights by Brilliant physicists and mathematicians ripe for the picking (as evinced by multiple cases of identical independent inventions) and on the other hand they had the backing of a monopoly of incredible proportions. The planets don&#x27;t often align like that.<p>Monopolies and excess profit are almost always a sign of market failure. However, some have argued that one of the benefits of a monopoly is it allows firms to reinvest some of that beyond normal profits and reduced costs on R&D (also typically argue monopolies are temporary because creative destruction). If you consider that only those like Google, Samsung, GE, IBM and Microsoft can even consider such broad-based research then it seems there is merit to the idea.

The system is more efficient, but there is a base-line which is impermeable. The only way to go below that is to train many more doctors, and start paying them something closer to an average wage, but, firstly, they&#x27;d just move abroad, and secondly, you would not be able to persuade the candidates to train for ten years if they didn&#x27;t earn a decent professional wage.

In case it helps, consider the following two ways of thinking about land as property.<p>1) Any land covered by something valuable that you &quot;produced&quot; yourself is your property. A house, a corn field, a copper mine, etc. But land in a state of nature is not. For example, 10 acres of forest in a state of nature would not be your property, because you haven&#x27;t &quot;mixed your labour&quot; with it.<p>2) Even that 10 acres of forest can be your property, and you get to control (access to) it, because you need to know that <i>you</i> will get to benefit from any value you produce with that forest, even if it takes some time to get started, let alone &quot;materialize&quot; that value. Maybe you&#x27;re planning to build an amusement park, but need to figure stuff out first, and make sure you&#x27;ll have everything you need before starting the project. Maybe that will turn sour, and then you&#x27;ll switch to some other goal with the forest. But if you don&#x27;t have the right to control (access to) the forest <i>before</i> you do something with it, then you just won&#x27;t <i>do anything</i> with it because you have no guarantee of getting to benefit from the value you produce. The latter case would be a loss to other people too, because something they&#x27;d benefit from (even if in exchange for a fee) would not come to be.<p>I think both 1 and 2 make sense.",1387266515

It&#x27;s automation to analyse blood tests in combination, and look for profiles for diagnosis.

Bell Labs was the first to leave the Multics project.<p>It took several years for Thompson, Ritchie, McIlroy and Ossanna to get funding.<p>They did it under the radar with a PDP-7 garbage picked by Thompson while sending letter after letter to get funding for a DEC PDP-10 or Sigma7 which they would use to create the OS and play games/simulations (i.e. Space Travel). Mind you computer time in the late 60&#x27;s was upwards to $75 and hour.<p>After all is said and done Bell Labs at the time was a government regulated national telecommunications monopoly and was not allowed to sell it. They could licenses it though and did. Berkeley only had to pay for the tapes since they where a school.<p>FWIW they didn&#x27;t get the funding based on asking to program an unspecified OS but to create system specifically designed for editing and formatting text. The big buzzword back then was &quot;word processing&quot;. Also the higher ups already knew by then that they had something which Ken and Dennis had done on their own. AT&T bought them a PDP-11 and the first end user applications where for AT&T patent dept. to be used by secretaries.<p><i>Thus, during 1969, we began trying to find an alternative to Multics. The search took several forms. Throughout 1969 we (mainly Ossanna, Thompson, Ritchie) lobbied intensively for the purchase of a medium-scale machine for which we promised to write an operating system; the machines we suggested were the DEC PDP-10 and the SDS (later Xerox) Sigma 7. The effort was frustrating, because our proposals were never clearly and finally turned down, but yet were certainly never accepted. Several times it seemed we were very near success. The final blow to this effort came when we presented an exquisitely complicated proposal, designed to minimize financial outlay, that involved some outright purchase, some third-party lease, and a plan to turn in a DEC KA-10 processor on the soon-to-be-announced and more capable KI-10. The proposal was rejected, and rumor soon had it that W. O. Baker (then vice-president of Research) had reacted to it with the comment `Bell Laboratories just doesn&#x27;t do business this way!&#x27;</i> --Ritchie 1979 <a href=\"http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/hist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/hist.html</a><p>Towards the end of the 80&#x27;s Berkeley students took a nod from Richard Stallman and put their distribution on the net (which was mostly rewritten at that point (It was Keith Bostic who proposed removal of non-AT&T code)).<p>ATT UNIX was licensed at about $200k while the BSD patchset was just a piece of software you added if for anything the TCP/IP stack, vi, job control, curses, mail services and csh.<p>I don&#x27;t for a minute believe that Google or ATT are in any way for the greater good of society and research any more than I would believe that apple or microsoft care about education and/or removing vender lock-in.

Every field is disrupted by software in the same fashion: massive resistance where practitioners claim the human element is crucial, then of gradual swapping out of manual for automated where it helps, to in the long run largely automated.<p>I see a big parallel here with education: I am related to teachers and of course they will swear up and down that hand-crafted, personalized lesson plans are key, and teacher-student interaction invalidates the need entirely for automation. I&#x27;d imagine in the long run 80% of these &quot;only humans can do it&quot; tasks will be shown to be performed better by expert systems and data-driven algorithms.<p>Of course the catch is that nobody wants to be told that a large part of the skills they&#x27;ve developed over a lifetime have been made obsolete or relatively worthless through some code and electrons. Software engineers, and many engineering fields in general are used to the idea that every 5 or 10 years most practical knowledge is obsolete, that computers are relentlessly automating things done manually just a few years previous, and to not fight it but embrace it and try to leverage it. I don&#x27;t think this is a common mentality for most professions. Even physicians for the most part, unless they work in an academic institution, let their reading fall by the wayside and develop habits and ritual around what they were doing when they finished residency.",1387264295

Technology definitely has helped us to live longer and diagnose more accurately.<p>I don&#x27;t have any source to backup my arguments and claims, but for many older medical practitioners, including my family (we have been a medical practitioner for several generations), we feel that the younger doctors lack of confident and knee knowledge because they rely on machines. I have a hard time to put my family&#x27;s words into English because they are Chinese (they are Western medicine practitioner btw), but the basic idea is that they learn to use their fingers and their sensory inputs to gather empirical information about the patients. I won&#x27;t say they can diagnose a tumor at a precise location or detect the type of cancer precisely, but experts can diagnose to a very good estimate. Back then they didn&#x27;t have x-ray in every hospital. Only the major one has x-ray in China and my grandma and my father had to use their fingers to determine the location of the tumor, or the type of tumor. When my dad first saw the x-ray machine back in the 70s when he was still in China, it was amazing to him what he could do with him, but he said practical experiences and hands-on experience matter.<p>Ask how many new practitioners can do that with confident? I supposed few. Because most of them rely on machines.<p>What if machine is down? What if the machine is not capable of telling the truth? It has limitation.<p>I am arguing that machines can&#x27;t help, but doctors should never rely on machine. They need to rely on their experience and knowledge and this is what distinguish an expert from an average practitioner.<p>To be honest, getting people x-ray all the time is largely because of suing medical mistreatment and then good part of just being efficient (or lazy if you want to be harsh). Hospitals are scared of getting sued so they&#x27;d put everyone through an x-ray machine.",1387263654

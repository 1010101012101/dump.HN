Name of work: <i>al-Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wa'l-muqabala</i> (""A Handbook of Calculation by Completion and Reduction"").<p>John Derbyshire examines al-Khwarizmi's work in chapter 3 of <i>Unknown Quantity: A Real and Imaginary History of Algebra</i> [ISBN 978-0-452-28853-9], which I just finished reading a few days ago.<p>The first part of al-Khwarizmi's book concerns finding the roots of first- and second-order polynomials of one unknown. He classified the polynomials into 6 fundamental types, with all positive coefficients. Keep in mind, that negative numbers did not exist at the time, though subtraction did. He showed how to manipulate polynomials into a suitable one of the 6 types by adding a term (al-jabr, completing) or subtracting a term (al-muqabala, reducing).<p>Says Derbyshire, ""al-Khwarizmi has no literal symbolism--no way to lay out equations in letters and numbers, no sign for the unknown quantity and its powers."" The problems, the fundamental types, the procedures are all presented in words.<p>Interestingly, Diophantus 600 years earlier did addition and subtraction of polynomial terms using ""a rich literal symbolism to aid the manipulations.""",1233464398

I don't fully understand the process, but I believe it works like this:<p>You can't read the atoms in DNA one after the other and make a list. You chop the DNA into pieces and pattern match sections (fragments) against markers. Then you try to put fragments together by matching overlaps.<p>But if you have sections that repeat, or have a lot of the same atom over and over, you can't directly read those.<p>Usually when they say: ""we published the DNA"" they mean the ""coding section"" - those are the sections that can make proteins. But there is a lot more to DNA, non-coding, or junk DNA that can not be easily (or at all?) read.<p>So for the comment above yours, I think what they have is fragments, but no overlapping sections, so that can't put it together into a whole.

I have no idea how many are unable and how many merely unwilling; I'm not even sure the distinction matters or how you go about deciding it. (By the way, where did you get that phraseology? It sounds like NLP.)<p><i>Same goes for actors and boxers and cops. This seems, almost tautologically, true of any industry.

Obviously the mediocre outnumber the competent at any activity, but that usually doesn't become the dominant fact about that activity. For example, there are many more bad musicians than good ones, but the demand for music doesn't vastly exceed the supply of good musicians.

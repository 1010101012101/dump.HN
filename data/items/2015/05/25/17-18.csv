I think the author makes a valid point.<p>When I choose my iPhone, my MacBook Air, my Martin acoustic guitar, etc, I didn&#x27;t need a salesman to explain to me how great these products were. I went into the store and tried them out for myself. No one ever had to convince me to purchase the product. The product did that by itself.<p>On the other hand, if someone has to convince me to purchase a product I was never looking to purchase, or over a competitors, the product probably wasn&#x27;t that great in the first place.",1432576746

Offices are expensive, compared to the alternative.<p>I agree with the article about placement, but I strongly disagree with this constant sentiment that open offices suck.

It explains why we may moan about surveillance but continue to use Gmail and Facebook; why we shudder in distaste at what goes on in the Chinese factories that make Apple products yet continue to enjoy our iPhones; and why we are horrified by lethal fires we read about in Bangladeshi sweatshops and yet pounce gleefully on T-shirt bargains in retail outlets whenever we can find them.<p>Interestingly, our addiction to convenience has recently received a powerful boost from another regrettable human failing – our craving for instant gratification .

Setting up a development environment for a new hire is just a matter of cloning the repository and running nix-build. (Though for some apps, there&#x27;s also a third step: run a script to set up the database.) Once an app works in the dev environment, it just works in staging or production.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that we never have configuration issues, but mostly they come from weirdness in 3-party packages. For example, recent versions of `node-pg` (postgresql bindings for node) have an implicit dependency:  if you want to use the native library instead of the pure-Javascript implementation, you must also install `pg-native` alongside pg. That&#x27;s just in the README, though, there&#x27;s no peerDependency declared in pg&#x27;s package.json file, so npm2nix can&#x27;t generate the appropriate nix expressions.<p>Using nix definitely gives you the sense of swimming upstream, because the rest of the world doesn&#x27;t understand this stuff and doesn&#x27;t care.

I used the company online form to do this: http://www.zyxel.com/us/en/form/gpl_oss_form.shtml<p>I asked for the source code of the latest version of the firmware which is: 3.10(VBH.0)C0\nThis version is from Oct 9, 2011 which is more than 3 years old.<p>ZyXEL response was this:<p>Dear Sir/Madam:<p>Thank you for choosing ZyXEL products, and Sorry for inform you below messages.\nAccording to GPLv2 license terms (below black frame ) and ZyXEL policy that we will keep each firmware’s Open Source Code at least three years.\nHowever, we released 3.10(VBH.0)C0 over three years , so we don’t have open source code can provide for you.<p>Sorry for any inconvenience.<p>From my understanding, according to GPLv2 and GPLv3, you have to provide the source code if asked for at least 3 years since the last binary release.<p>The point is, are three years time enough to provide modifications from GPL´d code?\nThey still provide the firmware, I don´t know if they still support the router.\nBut I think that the GPL license should be updated in this regards. Source code should be provided over the Internet and as long as they provide the binary, they should provide the source code as well.\nAnd no body releases source code on a physical support...<p>Am I right?",1432576398

9600951,comment,9600803,9600880,0,0,emidln,,,"When I built this a couple companies ago for a charting/dashboarding app, we used components simply had channels to receive events and send events. When a component was to be loaded, it provided a map of its data dependencies so that we could ensure efficient batching and appropriately updated queries. Unloading was resolving that in reverse. Clojurescript + core.async and some macros made this very very easy to implement, use, and extend, but you could easily do it on top of whatever random messaging system and virtual-dom you wanted.<p>In my app&#x27;s scenario, we made a render decision based on the input and output for the component render functions. Prior to rendering the view, if the data was identical to what already existed, no updates occurred. cljs made this cheap. After constructing the template (hiccup-style, more cljs data), if it wasn&#x27;t different, we&#x27;d also skip the DOM update.<p>For methods on the component (handling various events and such), they all take a channel where they could send whatever events it was that they needed to send.<p>The data service managing a query for one or more components just blocked its goroutine until it received an update to its query data structure, resolved it, and if it was different than the existing query data structure, would debounce for more changes before sending off the request. Requests back to the server were ordered by an atomic counter (atom 0) such that out of order responses could be processed sanely. Everything was one-way.<p>Additionally, while we could dynamically render everything, pages were a layout data structure containing 0 or more components with associated data services. These were all described in EDN and thus could be serialized, queried, and rendered server side if necessary.<p>All of this machinery was pretty small, no more than about 1800 LOC building on top of some excellent cljs libraries.",1432576370

9600949,comment,9598210,9599669,0,0,FungalRaincloud,,,"It is, I believe, still used, but the lack of development is certainly a concern. I believe it&#x27;s every bit as common to create disposable accounts on other chat clients and just enable OTR[0] for whatever protocol you use. Traffic is typically still routed through Tor, and since the account is disposable, you shouldn&#x27;t need to worry about it being linked to you. Only true concern is that the protocol you pick might not be running on a hidden server, so the records of that server could be subpoenaed. However, for example, you can pick hidden xmpp services, which means you only have to trust that the service itself is being run by entities who have no reason to compromise your endpoint or manipulate your chat experience. It means you have to be on the same server as the person you&#x27;re looking to contact, and it means that you need a way of establishing the identity of the person you&#x27;re trying to talk to. OTR does this by having secret questions and answers, which have to match at least the first time you talk to someone. I would personally combine this with PGP key verification, if the person has a known public key. It&#x27;s easy to see someone type in the answer to the secret question, or even guess it if the person doesn&#x27;t think far enough ahead to make that unlikely, but (hopefully) much more difficult to grab the person&#x27;s private key and passphrase.<p>[0] <a href=""https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/</a>",1432576354

This can further be seen by considering the definition of &quot;Installation Information&quot;: “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.<p>In short, the User Product is the thing you install the covered work (the GPLv3&#x27;d thing) on and run it on, which for an App Store would be the iPhone or iPad. Unless GPLv3 is not using &quot;possession&quot; and/or &quot;transaction&quot; in their normal meanings, there is no way to characterize purchasing and downloading an app from the App Store as being a transaction in which the right of possession of the iPhone is transferred. Since no definitions of possession or transaction are given in the license, we can assume their normal meaning.<p>I haven&#x27;t raised this issue with the FSF because I don&#x27;t see it as an issue. They are the ones that specifically put in the limitation that Tivoization only occurs for GPLv3 object code conveyed as part of a transaction where the right of possession of the User Product is transferred to the person receiving the object code. In general, considering how much time they spent on drafting this thing, I generally assume it means what it says and it says what they intended.<p>If they somehow botched the drafting and that is not what they meant, it doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway because if it ends up in court and the parties disagree on how they interpret those parts, the court will go with what it says, not what the drafter claims they meant. So, my general policy (with all licenses, not just GPL) is to go with what they say, unless they are too ambiguous and then I avoid the covered software. (Actually, before I get to that point I first see if I can limit my use of the work to only those uses that do not require the permission of the copyright holder. If I can limit me needs thusly then I can ignore the license).",1432575750

Get this:<p><pre><code>    int get_prime (int a) /* vector-using function */\n    (   /* the second pair of parentheses in a\n         * function definition is for its actual\n         * context (and likewise for the rest (of\n         * the content (blocks)))\n         */\n\n        int vector(100);\n\n        vector(0) = 2;\n        for (int i = 1; i < a; i++)\n        (\n            for (unsigned int j = vector(i-1) + 1;\n                j != ~0;\n                j++)\n            (\n                int k = 0;\n                for (; k < i; k++)\n                (\n                    if (j % vector(k) == 0)\n                    (\n                        break;\n                    )\n                )\n\n                if (k == i)\n                (\n                    vector(i) = j;\n                    break;\n                )\n            )\n        )\n\n        return vector(a);\n    )\n</code></pre>\nNow it&#x27;s almost as annoying to read as it would have been if written in Lisp, isn&#x27;t it?",1432574448

The net result is there are too many of them. And since they are far away from schools/hospitals/markets and other amenities, nobody really opts for rent in these places. Eventually as the cities grow this may change, but note as time goes your apartment ages too(and so does its value). There is a huge debate whether as to buying an apartment is a better idea or a buying a plot given these circumstances. Every one wants a rent income, very few want the struggle of buying the land, protecting it from encroachers and build it later[which is an circus in itself], most want a ready made flat. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Like in all cases good investments are a lot of hardwork and stressful.<p>Inside the cities houses are always in epic demand.

Both procedurally and in scope of effect there will be differences of course (commissioners are much more powerful, and therfore should be held to a higher level of scrutiny).<p>In any case, similarity of jobs is orthogonal to the narrow question - who has the stronger mandate?<p>Take Person A who via an elected representative would like to effect legislative change in their nation. Who has the stronger mandate to take action?<p>In other words, which representative would be closer to the truth in saying that &quot;they were acting in Person A&#x27;s name&quot;?<p>1. For the sake of argument, let&#x27;s take the UK Prime Minister. He is voted for by a party consisting of members of the public via an open process to represent a specific platform; is elected directly by a constituency numbering in the low tens of thousands of people who happen to live in a geographical area of the nation under representation.<p>Furthermore, the representative is a widely known public figurehead with a well-known platform meaning that although members of the public in other constituencies cannot affect his election to parliament directly, they can affect the amount of power he wields. The election covers 70 million people.<p>2. For an EU Commissioner a shortlist of representatives are chosen <i>in secret</i> by a team of people, each of whom is a proxy, elected via a process similar to (1). One of the shortlist is chosen by a vote from members of a directly elected parliament. The election takes into consideration the views of 3/4 billion people.<p>The EU commissioner shortlist process is secret (and thus open to nefarious influence - go on: tell me this will not happen), the final vote is diluted by the views of an order of magnitude more people, spread over a much greater geographic area (meaning a much wider range of concerns need be taken into consideration), and the commissioner need not have been elected directly by anyone from the population he represents (other than via proxy).<p>Based on this, it is clear that the representative in scenario (1) has a stronger claim to be said to be acting in the name of Person A than the person elected via process (2).<p>The EU is hence less democratic than the institutions is is replacing, and is in some sense democratically regressive.<p>(And this is before any discussion about the differences in the legislative path between Westminster and the EU).",1432573987

I rate the chances of the NSA deciding that these are not &quot;phone calls&quot; for the purposes of the expiry at 100% likely.<p>That&#x27;s assuming they can&#x27;t simply stop collecting call metadata, but then keep collecting tower signalling metadata or something like that, thus allowing them to tell themselves that&#x27;s not what Congress cared about ..... and then extract call metadata on demand from it.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that the NSA cannot be controlled by anything at this point. The DoJ would need to jail Clapper to get their attention and that won&#x27;t happen short of some ridiculous sex-related personal scandal.",1432573718

Instead, find 3 or 4 hours to finish some introductory tutorials to actually get to know the thing.<p>This 3 hour work will relieve you from weeks, even months, of uncertainty/lurking, not to mention the possible anxiety due to not understanding people&#x27;s conversations. By the end of the 3 or 4 hour studying, you actually learned something, and can decide confidently on your next moves.<p>For example, as a Vim user, I always wanted to learn Emacs, and god know how much time I have wasted in reading those fun editor war threads. Last month in one evening I finally installed it, finished the built-in tutorial in 2 hours. Then I installed Spacemacs which has been hot recently, I spent another 2 hours playing around, learning how to configure it. In 4 hours I gained a pretty solid idea about Emacs&#x27; setup, how to do common tasks, some useful packages, including the annoyingly frequently mentioned Org-mode (ok, it is indeed powerful, e.x., the calendar thing is pretty rad). Emacs is extensible for sure, but I know I don&#x27;t have time to learn it now. I also know in the future I will start with default Emacs, not Spacemacs, if I renew my learning.<p>Anyway, I have this problem of waiting and lurking. IMO spending a few hours finishing one or two tutorials _today_ is a much better approach than weeks/months of evaluating through reading Reddit/HN posts. For example, even if you apply this method conservatively -- once every 15 days, you will accumulate _hands-on_ knowledge on more than 20 new technologies in a year.",1432573333

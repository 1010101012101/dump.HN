345042,comment,343693,344671,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"By use of the phrase ""public service"" I think your question misses the point. Education was considered a national necessity as part of our ability to fight wars (once again, as I was told, it gets more complicated) City governments pick up the trash as a service. Services are optional, nice-to-have things. Education was deemed a requirement, and local schools were left to handle that in any way they wanted (until relatively recently)<p>There is a large section of the population which believes that education is being done so poorly as to need re-vamping completely -- getting back to the days where the goals were set but the methods were left open to each school. I'm one of these people. I'm all for the national goal of education as being required for war-fighting and citizenship. The current system, however, looks to have quite a few flaws. I'm all for iterating and re-factoring.<p>Healthcare, or taking care of the sick, has traditionally been seen as a church-related activity in the States. This began to change in the 1930s when FDR enacted legislation to help people in their retirement (although the initial age of benefits was also the average death age, so on average nobody saw these benefits unless they lived longer than most)<p>You have to remember that in the States, multiple religions and cultures each took care of things like healthcare locally with hundreds of different solutions. There are hundreds of charity hospitals, for instance. In that manner, healthcare is considered a personal moral responsibility, not a public repsonsibility. Public responsibilities are those I owe the state -- voting, armed service, jury duty, etc. Moral responsibilities are those I owe a particular person based on my moral compass -- gifts to the homeless, charities (the U.S. leads the world in charities), etc.<p>The U.S. is beginning to believe that all of these moral responsibilities must/should be delivered by government. That takes away any personal involvement or critical thinking of mine and lets the government simply ""write the check"" for whatever moral ills we all agree on. I'm against this and view it as a step backwards -- replacing a distributed, intelligent, self-optimizing system with a rigid centralized one. But this is clearly the direction we've been going over the last 70 years and I would expect it to continue.",1225108502

345037,comment,344864,344957,0,0,greyman,,,"I agree with you.<p>During my career I worked for 3 companies and technically my job was always the same - software developer, including both design and implementation. But the overall situation was different because every company has different culture, software development processes, etc.<p>Having been 10 years in this industry, I am not a young developer anymore, but if I would have to look for a new job now, I would focus on two points:<p>1) Whether the company has good software development processes and experts in software engineeering I can learn from, in other words if they know ""how to do software"". It looks obvious, but you would be shocked how haphazardly some companies develop their software. If you end up in such a company, your grow as a developer will be slower.<p>2) Good paycheck. I don't say this is most crucial, but it just feels better if you have a feeling to be appropriately rewarded, money wise. ;-)",1225107533

Also, if you dig around through public data, you find that the top 10% of Americans make about 70% of the income and pay about 70% of the personal taxes. Sounds fair right?<p>However, the top 1% make about 47% and pay only 39%, meaning the next 9% make about 23% but pay 31%. Is it just at all that the top 1% of America has a lower tax burden than the next 9%? Thank capital gains taxes for that.<p>I can't find the data, but if you were to break this down even further by 10th of a percent, you'd probably find that even more exaggerated.",1225106184
345028,comment,343693,344828,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I think even in the case of rape, practical grounds matter. If making it illegal didn't decrease the amount of rapes but increased violence and furthered the profits of organized crime families, why would one make it illegal? You'd simply have to attack the problem from another angle, as we should be doing (but aren't) with drugs.<p>Of course there are gray areas. What if rape laws decreased rape by 10%, but increased other forms of violent crime double that?<p>But in general, if a law's overwhelming result is negative, like our drug and gambling prohibitions, there's no point to them no matter how moral they may be. The money and effort would be much better spent on prevention and rehabilitation.<p>Unless your communities that are so afflicted are much different than ours, I expect prohibition won't work much better for you than it does for us. People are going to get what they want. Demand for vices seems to be inelastic the world over.",1225106002

Hell, every time someone drops a cigarette in California hundreds lose their homes. That's not true of health insurance.<p>Tort reform and caps on payouts for malpractice suits are necessary.

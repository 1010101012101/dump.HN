I think a policy of intra-company transparency, or a policy to openly discuss everything, as you put it, is instrumental to avoiding co-founder problems.",1187711890

44808,comment,44511,44769,0,0,chaostheory,,,"Why are we even talking about IQ, like it's even important?<p>I could be wrong, but in my opinion the only thing that IQ has really proven is its ability to predict how well a person will do in school. I doubt it really does much for predicting titans of industry (or some other area) and success in general. <p>I think its main flaw is that in general, life isn't constrained to a limited set of multiple choice answers; it's a lot more open ended and chaotic. Not to mention that some of the questions used to administer these tests are biased... and o yeah, there are also different types of intelligence...<p>(Yes I have a high IQ, and high scores of other major ancient traditional testing methods.)<p>IQ or the way it's currently administered is just too archaic, limited, and just outdated. It needs to change.",1187711547

In real life, even managers have a hard time forcing tools on people--there are various good and bad reasons for this. For a co-worker to say--for instance--""We need to replace this Java code with Lisp"", is definitely the short road to ridicule. <p>
Throwing away working systems, processes, technologies, well...not usually wise.",1187709905
44802,story,,,5,21,drm237,"Search without Google Tracking You (My 'pseudo' Startup)",,"There's been a lot in the news lately about search engine privacy, so I thought for a quick project it might be interesting to make a site that doesn't allow the search engines to track you.  It's still alpha quality, but please take a look and give me some feedback.  Thanks.

The government wanted to take back that piece of spectrum, but the courts said that the bankrupt company had title to the spectrum and the government would just have to get in line behind all the other creditors for a piece of its debt.<p>Presumably the FCC is trying to make sure this doesn't happen again.",1187709820

44797,comment,44743,44743,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"The issue is that individuals are forced (by family, school or the system) to work at things they do not enjoy, therefore the value they produce is not proportional to the amount of energy spent THINKing or DOing. The main cause of all these problems is the system. 95% of people are brainwashed and asked to follow a path that someone else designed. It is not always a bad thing to follow another path, but at least know who the heck designed it. The consequences are people make money and are not happy, people go to work and count down the hours before they can live. To them work is going from 9 to 5 ( or any schedule) instead of  accomplishing ""step n today"". Now most of those 95% won't get it. If they did, forums like this one would not exist. Sometimes the  beauty of  life lies in "" some of us not getting IT"" (where IT could be anything). ",1187708460

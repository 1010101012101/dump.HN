153374,comment,153253,153253,0,0,andr,,,"I rather like the feel of the site. However, I think you should order trends by the percent of users that like them, not total number of users. Otherwise, every trend's popularity would be going up as your user count increases.<p>Plus trendcasting is rather trendy in itself, so your data would be somewhat skewed. It will be interesting to analyze the developments of trade compared to total market share data (easy to get for public companies) as a time series problem. Then you get into the business forecasting area and your data would be worth some serious cheddar.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1207173479
153373,comment,153334,153361,0,0,parker,,,"Also, I read somewhere that launching at a conference means that you're one of dozens of launches over a short period of time, and you have to compete even harder for coverage from press/bloggers.  Whereas, if you launch on a non-descript day, you may be the only interesting thing happening all day, and get a copious amount of coveage.",1207173429

What he is looking for is likely more than just exceptional skill and high dedication. The Denver-based Java expert he's looking for should also have a sense of ownership, which is most easily accomplished by actually giving him ownership (equity). Owners don't walk away from projects as readily as employees, and they usually work a lot harder (at least in the early stages).",1207172451

The same can be said of YouTube: there is tons of copyrighted stuff, a few short ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" style stuff, and then there is some excellent user-produced made-to-entertain content.

153361,comment,153334,153334,0,0,pg,,,"Conferences to show off new startups are a good thing, but it seems like a bad plan to make the startups launch <i>at</i> the conference.   Unless the date happens to be exactly when the startup would have launched anyway, this constraint is going to force them to launch either too early, or too late.<p>Launching late is very dangerous.  Someone else is probably doing what you're doing, and if you launch even a couple weeks later your company could for the rest of its life be described as an X-like site, where X is your competitor's name.<p>Launching too early is even more dangerous.  The right time to launch is as soon as you have something (a) useful and (b) not totally broken.  Which means that launching early = launching something useless or broken.",1207172129

Let me try and address some of your points.<p>""I think if you place social suggestions at the heart of the service it just becomes another social news site.""<p>I agree. We focused on this first because having user input is important to us. We strongly want to avoid becoming a digg or reddit clone, but at the same time we want to avoid being based only on science and mining the data from other sources.<p>“When you're talking about trend identification and forecasting, most customers want some degree of editorial analysis (Springwise, Teentracking focus groups, etc.) and/or some type of meta-analysis based on aggregate data, such as search data (Yahoo Buzz, Google Trends)”<p>I totally agree.  Our system balances our users opinions with data from outside sources (we call this the X-factor.)  By combining the two data streams we are able to get (imho) the best of both worlds. As I said, the front end for the users took up a lot of time; however, we are working hard on refining our algorithm and adding more sources.
We want to combine the data driven resources of a Nielsen with the forward thinking early adopters of a “look-look’ (<a href=""http://www.look-look.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.look-look.com/</a>)<p>“How do you plan to make money?”<p>We want to connect our users with businesses.  Users can trade points for products and opportunities from the right sponsors. Someone who is into sports could have an opportunity to try out the newest snowboard. We are working on this part of the site, but expect it to be up with in a month.

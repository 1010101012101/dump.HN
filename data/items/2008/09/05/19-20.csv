A managing partner's performance is directly linked to how many bad deals they avoid - avoiding ""true negatives"", minimizing ""false positives"".  Because of this performance metric, investors are risk-adverse and I can't blame them for it.  If we want innovation to be funded, the LP's need to tweak how the managing partners are measured.  Managing partners are paid for their ""insight"" into emerging industries.  Well, then penalize them for great deals that they passed on - the ""false negatives"".  They should be accountable for the ""false negatives"" as much as the ""false positives"".  That's what they are paid to do.",1220643673

And, in fact, I was wrong to call the consequences of the 3G redesign ""bad"". They're arguably bad for <i>me</i>, because what I want isn't necessarily the same as what the majority wants. But lots of people are very happy! Because they criticized the product, and Apple listened!<p>Whether or not the 2G-to-3G design changes are bad or good isn't my main point. The point is that these changes were made in response to <i>intense</i> customer feedback -- Apple customers are scarcely apathetic -- and that just about all of the problems highlighted in the original article are side effects of this attempt to give customers <i>what they asked for</i> as quickly as possible.<p><i>Wish AT&T would let people purchase the edge plan with the 3G phone though</i><p>That would indeed be great -- although in my case the real stumbling block was the fact that I scored a spectacular own goal: back in January I switched to AT&T <i>without buying an iPhone at the same time</i> and locked myself out of the subsidy. In retrospect, that was foolish -- I assumed that the second-gen iPhone would be sold on the same terms as the first one, without a carrier subsidy. Until AT&T announced their subsidy policy, months later, I planned to buy a 3G phone, higher monthly price and all -- the cost differential isn't <i>that</i> big once the subsidy is included.

However, the real reason that corporates don't upgrade is the cost of rollout.<p>In a big corporate you'll have literally 1,000s or 10,000s of desktops. This is compounded by the fact that a browser isn't a single application - it could be hundreds of applications.<p>Something like a bank is generally going to be very conservative, so they'll only attempt that if it's properly regressed and tested... The cost and risk of this (let alone if something does break) is generally not enough.<p>Only a couple of years ago I was at large bank that was still on Windows NT. They only migrated when the risk of being out of support outweighed the migration risk.<p>Even then, corporates have a fair bit of muscle and very often arrange extended support. A lot is of made of when products come out of support, but the reality is they are supported on these kinds of specific deals well beyond those timelines (and generally for a very tidy profit for the vendors).",1220642103

296188,comment,296082,296180,0,0,raganwald,,,"PD is not the only game in the family, there are four games that differ in the relationship between the payoffs. Which game it might resemble depends on how you evaluate the payoff matrix.<p>For example, in ""Chicken,"" coöperating means turning aside and defecting means driving straight. The payoff is very big for the person who defects while the other player coöperates, but there is a big penalty if both players defect simultaneously. Same game mechanics, different payoff table.<p>But all of the games have the property of having two basic choices: coöperate and defect. In this case, coöperating is dropping IE support and defecting is maintaining IE support.<p>Of course, these are n-player games and the matrixes are more complex because the payoffs depend on how many ""players"" defect.<p>I don't think communication matters for these games. It's always explained that you can't communicate, but teh really essential deal here is that you have to make your decisions simultaneously, no player sees the other player's decisions before making their own decision.<p>In that respect, real life is different: there can be early stage players like 37 signals that get ""opinionated"" and laggards can watch what they do before deciding.",1220641996

A really good strategy in the prisoner's dilemma is Tit-for-Tat. So the logic goes that if your competitor drops IE6 support then you should too. But here's the trick. Since you may have multiple competitors and (I think I'm right about this) only one iteration of play, there's no really good strategy to follow; so it's not really quite the prisoner's dilemma.<p>Most importantly, unlike the prisoners' dilemma, you can communicate with your competitors. Perhaps what you can do is collude with them to drop the support simultaneously since it would save you both money and aggravation. You might want to keep a backup site that does have support enabled in case they don't all hold up to their promise so that you don't get burned. I don't imagine that anyone would agree to a contract on something like this, so plan B is essential.",1220641439

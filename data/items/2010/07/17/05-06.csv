What if you're not the user of Cassandra, Redis, Lucene or a specialized analytics engine but its creator?<p>For request/response type of scenarios (unlike batch processing) you basically have two options: (a) Use a multi-process shared memory design (or even just the file cache), which is very cumbersome to implement because you cannot use pointers and hence none of the data structures in your favorite language's library. (b) Use shared in-process state with powerful concurrency primitives. That's what clojure helps you do.<p>You cannot avoid to choose between these two architectures by using distribution across machines. Distribution is built on top of whatever you do on a single machine.",1279345469

Those might not come up a lot for you, but <i>some</i> people need to do them, and would love to be able to speed that up by throwing several processor cores at the problem. Solving them on a cluster is a lot harder, and often unnecessary.<p>(On k-means clustering, in particular, Clojure-style transactional memory gives an almost linear speedup with the number of processor cores, without significantly changing the code.

1523353,comment,1522396,1522396,0,0,mindcrime,,,"My big problem with Wikipedia's notability guidelines is that they're too general.  I don't accept that ""notability"" has to mean ""known worldwide"" or ""known by a large number of people regardless of their domain.""  I believe that notability within a given domain (say, programming) should be enough.  And I don't think there's much - if any - question that Steve is ""notable"" within programming circles.<p>Same with open-source projects... when the Wikipedia page for a F/OSS project is afd'd, the argument is always ""it hasn't been covered in the NY Time"" versus ""but every geek knows about it, uses it, considers it notable, etc.""<p>Ok, to be fair, there's some grey area here... make the domain small enough and <i>everybodY</i> is notable.  (To themselves, for example).  But I still think the WP policy needs adjusting...  it's just not working for the way people expect and want to use Wikipedia.",1279344638

To solve it, you need to either use an algorithm like Paxos, or use some central synchronization point like a Redis or memcached server. Yes, node.js fails compared to Clojure when it comes to taking advantage of multiple cores on this example. Clojure's concurrency primitives are really slick.

Before that it was just a job that barely kept his expenses going. And I am pretty sure that was not the kind of world we live in. Becoming famous enough took time back in his time.<p>I am pretty damn sure there must have been days he would have hated his ""job"" as a comedian, because it didn't look like it was going anywhere.\nAnd remember, this was the era when fighter pilots and airforce people were considered the coolest ones, and he was kicked out before even completing his Air Force enlistment.<p>So, I guess it would be safe to say, he had doubts about himself, and he was trying to explore what he was meant to do. And I think we can agree, there must have been days when he hated his ""job"" as a comedian, but just HAD to keep going.<p>Just because you love your job, doesn't mean you are not going to hate/ don't care about it anytime in future. \nI don't think Love/Hate are mutually exclusive. \nAt some point, there must be days when they occur intermittently.",1279343690

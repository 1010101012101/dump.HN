Ideally, your communication stream will seem perfectly innocuous to all observers.<p>Of course, in real life nothing is perfect.  So there's always a chance your use of encryption will be detected.  But using steganography properly should still reduce that chance to well below that of obviously encrypted systems like TOR, Freenet, etc.<p>Also, just as importantly, the more people use steganography, the greater the cost of widespread monitoring will become.<p>As pointed out in other replies in this thread, when you use regular encryption or systems like TOR, you're effectively raising a big red flag for anyone who cares to monitor your communication.  So detection is really easy.<p>But if you use steganography, the snoopers will have to work much harder to even stand a chance of detecting that there's anything unusual about your communication.  Multiply this by thousands or millions of people using steganography (especially if it's embedded in huge data transfers, like video streams) and the resource drain for effective, widespread monitoring could become unsustainable.<p>Right now the snoopers can go after the low-hanging fruit of obviously encrypted communications, and then maybe use rubber hose cryptanalysis to decrypt it, or simply block it.

2045918,comment,2042684,2043046,0,0,ebrenes,,,"Having been through similar bouts of depression in my teens and early twenties I also adopted some of daekan's techniques.<p>Personally, another thing that has helped me greatly is to preempt situations that have caused me to become depressed in the past. Because at least for me, it's incredibly hard to get past the hopelessness and despair without hitting rock bottom, and there's a lot of damage done before that happens. For me it's more economical to spend extra effort avoiding the depressive moments altogether than digging myself out of them.<p>So nowadays I just avoid things that trigger or resonate with those depressive emotions. So, I'll eschew watching movies that people describe as sad or depressing, no matter how good they might be. I don't fill my reading list with tragedies or existential dramas. I'm more picky in the type of music I listen to and purposely reduce the frequency with which I listen to melancholic songs.<p>I noticed talking about my negative emotions empowered them and gave them more substance. So now I only allow myself a limited number of instances to talk about my problems. Going to a therapist helped with this as it isolated those moments to a specific place, time and person. Thus reducing the desire to wallow in those negative thoughts with friends and acquaintances.<p>I've also removed people in my life who were extremely focused on their problems and misfortunes and replaced them with more active and happier people. Basically I've made an effort to befriend people that compliment my weaknesses (staying active and upbeat) instead of reinforcing them.<p>Being involved in periodic activities with others has also helped greatly. Like meeting with my old DnD group, despite being idle entertainment, was incredibly useful in getting me out of the house during weekends when I would be most tempted to stay in and be left alone with my thoughts.<p>The final thing was recognizing what situations, places and events are depressive triggers and avoid them like the plague. For example, I can't travel alone for extended periods: being isolated in a foreign country is an instant depressant. So now I always try to travel with friends or companions and that ends up being more enjoyable to boot.<p>Anyways, thanks to all who shared their experiences.",1293555260

When I worked on it, the code was running in Tcl 8.3 or 8.4, and I was able to reproduce the round trip through the string reliably with exactly the operations I described.  I may have printed the list to the console as part of the test, and if that qualifies as ""treating the list as a non-list"" it pretty well proves the need to assume the worst.  (It's also possible I was using older interfaces, even 10+ year old interfaces, since I kept my code consistent with the existing style in our software, but it's pretty harsh to say ""your fault"" if the interfaces for the most basic type in the language changed between versions 7 and 8, just saying.)",1293555179

2045910,comment,2045465,2045465,0,0,Lagged2Death,,,"I think one issue is the length of the bets. Ten years is a very long time for a human bet, but it's not very long in terms of history, in terms of heavy industrial technology, or in terms of Hubbert's ideas about resource peaks.<p>It was obvious that oil was a finite resource from the start, but it took the better part of 100 years of exploitation for US oil production to peak. Five or ten years doesn't seem long enough to reliably spot a trend on that scale.<p>I'm surprised Simmons expected such high prices. As the shock in 2008 illustrated, above a certain price, oil users cut back as much as they can, which lowers the price again. A sustained price of 200 2005-era dollars per barrel is a really high; that price would surely kill a lot of demand, which would probably prevent it from being sustained. Eventually, we may see $200/bbl, but it will probably be quite a while.<p>I know hindsight is 20/20, but still, I would have thought a better bet would be something about the average price of oil over (say) a five year period always being higher than the average price over the previous five year period. Then again, maybe Tierney wouldn't have taken that bet.",1293555082

Reason (3) has driven some otherwise cash rich companies with somewhat patient VC money to go public, and I expect it is what the SEC is looking at here. If pools try to buy, the SEC may look through the pool structure and count each of the pool investors as a separate investor, making it hard to keep under the 500 holder limit.

For all that it shares with Lisp, it definitely has never shared even a fraction of the popularity. They have two entirely different approaches and purposes though, so this isn't terribly surprising. Even if someone does create a new Prolog ala Clojure, it would probably still remain in academia.<p>I think a better question to ask is what direction is declarative programming headed in? Prolog is just one language in this field, as are some of the Prolog-alternatives listed by the OP. Remembering that SQL is also a declarative programming language, I believe that declarative languages are far from dead; it's a common paradigm, just not one we hear a lot of buzz about.<p>So all this said, it may be that Prolog doesn't necessarily need a successor. It does it's job well, but logic-based declarative languages are inherently too specialized to expect anything causing a surge of popularity.<p>One interesting variant of declarative programming is called Answer Set Programming. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming</a>). It's particularly good at modeling and solving NP-hard search problems, usually has Prolog-esque syntax, but does well on programs where Prolog would infinite loop (e.g. p :- not q. q :- not p.).

As a nice side-effect, there has been a rise in the number of organizations willing to take a chance on using Lisp for their products and services.<p>I see some parallels between Lisp and Prolog as families of programming languages.  There are likely as many hobby implementations of Prolog as Lisp.  Likewise, there is a gross misunderstanding of Prolog and Lisp among the general programmer population.  Also, it's unclear how to get started with Prolog and Lisp concerning: implementations, IDEs, documentation, and gurus.  To varying degrees, Clojure provides a solid answer to these common misunderstandings for Lisp, but what about Prolog?<p>Where is the logical successor to Prolog?<p>Some potential candidates are: Oz, Mercury, some sub-Prolog implementation embedded in another language, some other logic language altogether (e.g. Datalog).<p>Thoughts?",1293552562

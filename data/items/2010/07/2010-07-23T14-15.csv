It should come as a surprise that most researchers/scholars view their private libraries not in this way, they view it as a <i>source of information</i> of mostly unread books.<p>You should definitely read Eco's essay titled 'How to Justify a Private Library' in his collection <i>How to Travel with a Salmon</i>. In it, he discusses his answer to precisely the same question that you have put forth. Here's how he fantasizes answering the question ""Oh, what a large number of books you have! Have you read them all?""<p>""In the past I adopted a tone of contemptuous sarcasm. ’I haven’t read any of them; otherwise, why would I keep them here?’ But this is a dangerous answer because it invites the obvious follow-up: ’And where do you put them after you’ve read them?’ The best answer is the one always used by Roberto Leydi: ’And more, dear sir, many more,’ which freezes the adversary and plunges him into a state of awed admiration. But I find it merciless and angst-generating. Now I have falled back upon the riposte: ’No, these are the ones I have to read by the end of the month. I keep the others in my office,’ a reply that on the one hand suggests a sublime ergonomic strategy, and on the other hand leads the visitor to hasten the moment of his departure.""",1279896942

This set is second order which means it isn't computable.  Hilbert and others wanted a computable set of axioms so that one could, in theory, remove humans from the discovery of mathematical truth.<p>So the first order axioms were invented.  Godel showed that the first order axioms are not strong enough to prove all true statements about the integers.  There are infinitely distinct models of the first order integers.  There is only one model of the second order integers.<p>In the proof of the Incompleteness Theorem Godel proves a statement about an integer which is not provable in the first order system.<p>Humans can work in the second order system but not computers.  So, from my perspective there is something different about human thought patterns.  I'm not an expert and would like to know what is wrong with my reasoning.",1279896897

I emphasized the <i>typically</i> because this is a key idea: you are fallible -- <i>deal with it</i>!<p>I visited a local hacker-space with a friend of mine to talk about a project of ours.  A bunch of those guys are NASA and they know quite a bit about how to engineer for reliability.  Since our project involved a lot of soldering, he suggested that we estimate our average solder join failure rate and use that as the number of expected failures to look for.  That's what he does in his personal projects.<p>I exclaimed that was brilliant, then was a little embarrassed.  Of course!  Duh!  I know I'm not perfect and I'm smart enough to have deduced that I have something like an average failure rate for solder joins.  So why have I been proceeding for years and years as if I could just do everything perfectly if I just tried hard enough?<p>Every new function you write is a risk.  Minimize your risks.  Maximize the cost/benefit.  Every routine you optimize is a risk.  Minimize your risks.  Maximize cost/benefit.<p>One's problems as a programmer are more likely the result of excess hubris and not insufficient smarts.<p>EDIT: Fear is as big a problem as hubris.  Walk the middle path.

That was silly.<p>What makes it weird and different from physical phenomena is the fact that it is not generally observable, even though it is posited to exist for all people.<p>Or do you disagree even with that? If you do: I <i>don't</i> just mean that it doesn't emit visible light. I mean it doesn't emit <i>anything</i>. Consciousness is just the fact that the universe exists from a perspective. It is not an object, ""out there"", ""in the world"", but something <i>only experienced</i> by <i>each consciousness for itself</i>. The mere fact that we could create a perfectly convincing AI and then still have doubts about whether there really is ""anything in there"" is a result of the fact that consciousness is unobservable. Does that explain well enough what I mean?",1279896000

On all Apple phones up to now the black frame around the screen (or at least parts of it) lets light through for the proper functioning of the ambient light and proximity sensors. At the same time these sensors are invisible for the user - it's a flat black frame. The iPhone 4 is the first one with white front and it seem that Apple and the manufacturer of the screen glass are having hard time achieving the same effect.",1279894004

Facebook will stagnate only if the company loses it's enormous drive to dominate social and give people what they want.<p>Facebook is essentially a communication tool. There are two things in my mind that could become the ""next Facebook"". First is that centralized social networks fall out of favor and people use multiple ones to handle family separately from friends, etc. Second would be that a simpler, more effective alternative comes up. I see Twitter as that. Communication is more direct, simpler and much better tied in across all kinds of devices. Plus there is less stuff (groups, events, pages, games, privacy controls, public/private profiles, etc).<p>I really like Moots comment (guy who runs 4chan.org) that Facebook is like ""training wheels for the internet"". It's a secluded, safe garden for the masses. Yahoo is similar, as it's a directory for the internet.",1279893741

All these stupid problems moving off IE6 have been because of people using, then relying on, proprietary, non-standard additions to the browser. It seems like a good idea at the time; a few years later it's an albatross around your neck.<p>So here we are, a few years later - lesson learnt? Hardly. The ""solution"" to losing IE6's proprietary, non-standard additions to the browser is to use another proprietary, non-standard addition to the browser. Wonderful. In 6 years time they'll be going through the whole process again - <i>finally we can dump silverlight!</i>. Perfect for MS, of course, they couldn't care less as long as you're still using Windows.<p>Anyway, luckily consumer web developers did learn the lesson, which is why Silverlight will never achieve any real penetration in the consumer market.",1250146118

1. To read an article later as you have no time now.
2. To save a read article for later reference.<p>I use google reader, so:<p>For 1. I just keep items unread (key 'm'). This means I keep all my 'unread' and 'read-for-later' items in the same list in the same view in the reader.<p>For 2. I do not flag/star anything for reference as I trust Google Reader's search options to find stuff in the feeds. Google will find things way more easily than any scheme I think of to keep stuff referenced.<p>For your question: Why use 'star' or 'flag' at all as they have inherent semantic meaning depending on the person.<p>Why not leverage that to its fullest and just say 'marked/unmarked' and leave it up to the user to define what it means.",1250145887

Neither type needs or inspires great engineers.<p>Indian companies aren't (by and large)  startups  and/or doing technically sophisticated things, which is what would need <i>great</i> (vs just decent, or worse) engineers.). When you have an industry dominated by outsourcing/ODC it is hard to find a engineering focussed organizations.<p>Even the India centres of great companies like Google or Yahoo  do  (comparatively) uninteresting work - I have friends in both Google Bangalore and Yahoo Bangalore and they confirm this. Yahoo Blr does mostly operations , the ""Yahoo Research"" division in Bangalore is a joke. Google Bangalore  is not much better, though it has a couple of US returned engineers who are decent but by and large no really great projects happen here. Goog blr doesn't have much of a reputation within  Google either.<p>To get the kind of jobs advertised here, one of two things needs to happen (1) India develops its own rich ecosystem of technically sophisticated startups (except a couple of very small unfunded startups, most are just trying to copy existing ideas and don't need any skills beyond pretty generic php mysql etc) or (2)  great engineers in India should be able to telecommute for the startups advertised here.<p>Neither situation exists today, which is a tragedy. I know seriously good people who don't want to go through the visa/greencard  grind and so are stuck in awful jobs.<p>All that said, I'll be glad to be proved wrong. If there are any Indian startups which are (1) funded (enough to apay a decent salary) (2) doing  (technically) interesting things and (3) looking for great engineers, I hope they add a job listing here.",1250145410

(Dropping a class could trigger a check of who's watching the class and notify recipients that way.)<p>Writing in that line or two of code would also take care of the school's strange DoS concerns.<p>Of course, if profit is the goal, this isn't an option (though it doesn't look like you're trying to monetize this... kudos for that).<p>Also, this removes the exclusivity from classhunt (as any student would see this while browsing the schedule online).

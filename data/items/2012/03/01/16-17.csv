Read the first paragraph or two at your normal reading pace. Get a handle on what the chapter is going to be about. Then, skip to the last paragraph of that chapter. Consume it at your normal reading pace. Go back to the beginning of the chapter and read the first sentence of each paragraph in the chapter at your normal reading pace. Now, you have a great outline in your head on what this chapter is about. Now go back through it a third time, and speed read the crap out of it :) Try and read it as fast as you can. Because of the first 2 reads you'll have much better control on what paragraphs can be skipped, which need a little attention, and which need to be memorized.<p>It's not perfect, and you probably wouldn't read your best fiction this way, but it's helped me a ton.",1330620362

Those of us working on technical areas often struggle to explain our ideas to others not as technical, in a way that avoids oversimplification and losing essential meaning. Sometimes you'll discover an analogy or metaphor or phrase that does both. Seize those chances, they're powerful.<p>2. Coming up with a name is more important than you might think. If a good name will make your idea or product even 5% stickier, it follows that it may be worthwhile to spend 5% of your time just coming up with the name. One way to do it is to be constantly on the lookout for a good name while you're working on the product.<p>3. If you're writing about something that has policy implications, and want it to be read in Washington, it's hard but not impossible. Two important requirements are to network and build up an audience  they aren't going to read your blog just because it ranks high in Google searches  and to use language that non-technical people can understand.<p>Happy to answer any questions!",1330619019

We don't get salesmen calling us and pushing new releases; we maybe purchase every second or third new version.<p>Joel writes ""You need purchasing managers and CEO approval and competitive bids and paperwork.""<p>I think this is a bit over-reaching. Sure, you need manager approval, but that's been pretty easy to obtain in any engineering environment I've been in. Most of the time the software vendors come up with a new file format that's incompatible with the past, so you're practically forced to upgrade.

I think this has something to do with the fact that programming is not about the objects on screen themselves, it's about the interaction that occurs between those objects and the mind of the person looking at them. The objects are not real, but mere representations.<p>Therefore, the interaction I have with a block of code is defined by my experience wrestling with the problem at hand in the language of that block, during which my brain has ""mapped"" from the text to a sort of abstract visualization of its value (or ""serialized"", as you put it).<p>I don't think a tool that makes a ""picture-block"" for me will ever help. My brain has to do the work of understanding those blocks by compressing each text block into a form (block? graph node? neither?) that I can hold in my head.<p>Strangely enough, if the above is correct, that means that there is more value in implementing a tool like this (for the implementor) in $LANGUAGE than there is for a potential user. Perhaps this is why programmers keep writing them, and users keep on not using them.<p>As the user, I need to learn something either way, and learning is usually hard/expensive. Therefore, why learn the (imperfectly-mapped) ""picture-block"" abstraction at all?<p>It'd be interesting to see if programmers feel the need to keep using these sorts of tools them once they've written them.

3652607,comment,3652106,3652447,3,0,tomp,,,"> Dart appears to be reasonably competent and technically sound<p>Really? I got exactly the opposite impression.<p>All types are nullable (lack of null safety). Why are they using a type (String) for a constant (''final'' variable)? Mixing up <i>lists</i> and <i>arrays</i>. There is a separate string builder class ''StringBuffer'' (which does not share the interface with ''String'', I don't know why not, while ''int'' and ''double'' are unified under the interface ''num'') that doesn't really work. You can't iterate over maps using the ''for...in'' syntax (at least the overview does not mention it).<p>This document, to me, screams of technical incompetency, or at least of language design from 10 years ago.<p>There are also some other weird design choices, like optional non-typing (i.e. there are no safety guarantees, types are not enforced), all values but ''true'' are ''false'' (this feature might turn out to actually be useful, but as far as I understand, they want to force people to write proper boolean tests in if statements - why then even allow non-boolean values in boolean contexts?). The ''[x = 1]'' syntax for parameters with default value is really weird, I guess its purpose is to be consistent with the optional argument syntax, but why not just copy what Python does, with all parameters with default values be optional, and you can always set it to ''null'' yourself, if you want...<p>Julia, for me, is a recent language that is <i>really</i> well designed!",1330617774

They always come from your current customers, submitted via email, phone or social channels.  They need to be curated, often by more than one person in support or product management, and then dumped into a central repository.  After that, the product team has to go in and prioritize features based on criteria that links back to ROI: 1) how many of our existing paying customers will continue to pay us because of this feature, 2) how many new customers could we acquire if we included this feature, 3) how much time and effort does it cost to implement this feature<p>Why hasn't anyone built a Kickstarter tool that essentially funds new features based on customer demand?  In essence, a secure web portal that uses the Kickstarter model to crowd-fund new features.<p>This solves the problem discussed in the old adage: ""Always ask the customer if they are willing to pay for it [new features] when considering before developing them.""",1330617721

Unlike Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft appear to have rejected it out of pragmatism rather than principle. Specifically, Apple's Webkit engineers appear to object to the complexity and overhead a new virtual machine would add[1], and Microsoft has publicly stated that Dart doesn't solve any problems that can't be fixed in future iterations of Javascript[2].<p>For a more detailed technical and political perspective of why Mozilla won't implement Dart natively, see Brandon Eich's comments on the original Dart announcement[3] (it's actually quite an interesting read).<p>[1] <a href=""https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/018822.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/11/22/evolving-ecmascript.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/11/22/evolving-ecmas...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2982497"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2982497</a>",1330617673

After you're done doubling the length, ask yourself if anybody would actually have read the end result.<p>Having gone through a phase where I tried to write like that, I can tell you two things: First, ""no"". Second, it's <i>a complete waste of time</i>. Add in the caveat that you don't literally mean that there are 0 software packages sold in that price range, and you will <i>still get flamed</i> for the claim you just disclaimed. A lot of people are sloppy readers and putting in that level of detail is like putting fine detail in your painting for a farsighted person without their glasses.<p>I've come to view this sort of misunderstanding as an unavoidable tax for trying to communicate with humans.

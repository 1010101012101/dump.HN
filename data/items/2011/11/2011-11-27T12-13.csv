Also no longer the case.<p>Honestly I think Australia is choking on it's property prices which has fuelled massive debts.  It's why your chicken sandwich costs $15, because the rents are out of control because of the price the owner paid for the shop.<p>W/regards to not having access to Australian healthcare, I already knew that because I met a NZ guy ages ago who explained the whole deal.

(2) is a generalisation, but Chinese people tend to be quite speculative - I guess a few years ago the average Brit would be happy with a 4.5% return on a 2year bank bond, whereas many Chinese people are more willing to take much riskier investments with possibly much higher returns.<p>As for ignoring laws, the whole-country model (not just Wenzhou) is that many laws are ignored until the government decides to crack down on something.

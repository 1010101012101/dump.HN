You realize that in most western, patriarchal societies women were not <i>allowed</i> to participate?<p>Not to mention, many Native American cultures were matriarchal, and had absolutely no compunction about slaughtering each other <i>there</i>, either.<p>I find it somewhat ironic that your justification for saying that women are better than men is that they are more docile and empathetic - the very same reasons that were trotted about to try and deny women the vote (i.e., too docile and easily led by the nose politically, too emotional to vote rationally, etc). It's hard to consider you pro-female when you seem to riding the same train of thought as anti-female folk.<p>I do mean this in the most sincere, respectful way possible: have you considered taking a course in anthropology at your local university? I studied anthropology in a limited way during my time college, it was very eye-opening, and IMHO your viewpoint wouldn't stand up to a simple gut check against even introductory undergrad-level anthro. I know this may sound like I'm bashing you, but I'm really not trying to - IMHO you seem like you have a lot of misconceptions about culture and history which can be rectified by formal education on this subject.",1267955928
1173156,comment,1165623,1165623,0,0,blogdog,,,"A very interesting observation.. I tend to agree that the sheer number of frameworks and libraries makes programming into coping with flaws or badly documented ""features"". The other thing is that the programming world is much like an archipelago, where different islands develop their own programming culture, like .NET or JEE or PHP. And the islands are floating apart: It will become increasingly difficult to establish the better choice because of long learning curves. It is important to admit there are other cultures out there, that even might do a better job in particular areas. However, as much as frameworks get more sophisticated and cater to the programmers ideal of elegant and abstract formulation of the code, Managed Code, Reflection and even OO have a overhead cost in cycles and bytes, particularly when scaling up. As a 45+ programmer I sometimes weep about ""elegant"" code that drives your machine to the edge but only does a fairly simple job. Stacking API's and frameworks does certainly not always contribute to efficient and simple executables. Sometimes we just need to get back to the root, or at least understand what happens in the machine when we use a certain framework or library. For programmers that will remain a challenge, and fortunately will force us to reflect occasionally...",1267955610

It's also very scalable since you don't have to fill your memory with separate stacks for each thread and other overhead.<p>I recently wrote some server software around the Linux epoll() system call and found it simple and effective to use.

But each yellow ball determines exactly two blue balls (the ones in the bottom row): they're the ones you get by travelling left and right from the yellow ball in a straight line until the bottom. You can visually confirm it to be a 1-1 correspondence: different yellow balls will determine different pairs, and each pair is determined by some yellow ball.

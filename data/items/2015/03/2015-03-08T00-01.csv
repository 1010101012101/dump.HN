Why couldn&#x27;t you deal with it at the time?<p>Its a shame perhaps that men and women are not typically given the same upbringing, or have the same natural tendencies, when it comes to confrontation.<p>Not doing anything about it at the time, then moaning about it after the fact, as a man, is social suicide - its cowardly and makes you look weak.<p>As a woman these same behaviours are lauded as self control and intelligence - and the opposite, as being reactionary and thoughtless. You may be labelled as bossy, a control freak or worse...<p>Neither of these attitudes is quite right... however I do think that people need to stick up for themselves. Don&#x27;t expect any back up and fight your own corner... but then I am a man, and this is our default attitude. &#x27;being a man&#x27; very much means being strong, independent, self-reliant and unassailable... without asking for attention or rewards for doing so.

9163907,comment,9161777,9163074,0,0,potatote,,,"As someone who will be graduating in less than a year of PhD in comp sci., I would like to encourage you to not give up on all PhDs with such assumption. Like you, I am not impressed with the prospect of academia and research in general. But I honestly don&#x27;t think a majority of CS phd students at decent (top 50) universities will fail fizzbuzz test as long as they have had undergraduate CS background. Some of us may fail to implement BFS/DFS/merge/quicksort during a 45 minute interview, but I think this is due to the interviewing process for tech jobs being somewhat broken (I saw my peers studying 3 or more months with interview prep books/sites and thought it&#x27;s becoming ridiculous). A much better way to test a candidate would be to assign him/her a take-home assignment/project and let him/her work on it independently or along with your team, and judge his/her candidacy based on it (if your company can afford the extra time/resource for such process). I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll notice those PhD folks from CS would not be as bad as you think they are.<p>In any case, I&#x27;d (for selfish reason) encourage you to be open-minded and give applicants with PhD background at least an equal chance. Personally, I never wanted a PhD, but I went for it because I needed to keep my immigrant status legal, and I couldn&#x27;t pay for a master&#x27;s degree out of pocket (if I enroll for a PhD program, I get a master&#x27;s degree for free on the way). The downside of being a PhD student is that it is significantly more difficult for me to find my way back into software positions, which is something I wanted to do eventually; the HR usually throws away my resume with the assumption(s) that I am either only interested in research or am &quot;overqualified&quot; (or that I&#x27;d ask for more money), all of which are incorrect for a lot of PhD students, like me, stuck in academia for now. For all HR or recruiters reading this, I&#x27;d encourage you all to give PhD students a fair shot for the programming positions at your firms. You might find that these PhD students are more motivated or have more persistence/endurance (as most who survive the PhD experience usually have) or if you&#x27;re lucky, are better prepared and thoughtful programmers.",1425776111

However, strategic decisions are within his purview.  This is a endemic human resources issue that affects the well-being of the company.  It would be entirely and justifiably within his discretionary power to react however he saw fit, unlike a more junior office holder who would have a specific job description, a clear set of powers and responsibility, and less political power within the organization.<p>I am not arguing that speaking out would be the correct decision at this time.  In fact, as angry as the incident may make him, it might well be counter-productive to address it directly.

The routine and self respect of getting up and going to a job every morning is something people trying to re-integrate back into society really need. Not to mention money to buy things.<p>But I do have a story to relate. I was a construction project manager in my early 30&#x27;s. We did land reclamation in disturbed areas like mines. We had a large project reclaiming a mine in Arizona. The company I worked for hired lots of former convicts without discrimination, and fired them just about as quickly and also without discrimination. One of the water truck drivers had a cousin who had killed some people in his teens and had just gotten out of prison. The guy was I think late 20&#x27;s. He was living with his aunt and uncle. We had him out on the job staying at a motel with the rest of the crew for a few months. He was a bit odd, but he did OK work. When the job was over, we didn&#x27;t need the big crew anymore and he was laid off. About a month later he killed the aunt and uncle he was staying with and went right back to prison.<p>So even though this is a good program and I fully approve and think we need more programs like this.... there are qualifiers. Recently violent people may need more help or supervision after release, before they are ready to enter a workforce.",1425776054

Or gather data on the history of trade routes like the Silk Road by observing the growth of towns along them.  We might track the history of the Black Plague by observing the shrinkage of cultivated land, and the pause in the growth of urban centers.<p>We might learn a lot of climate science by gathering data on the explosion of Krakatoa and the subsequent effects on the polar ice caps.<p>We might gather data on the emergence and spread of agriculture from pre-history by observing transformation of forest land into farmland, and the appearance of greenery in places supportable only by irrigation.  You might tell the story of the Tigris and the Euphrates that way.<p>Of course, all of that depends on spectacular levels of resolution.  And those would have to grow as we looked back further in time, because the lensed light would appear that much further away.  I suppose most of what I&#x27;ve listed here could easily be outside any plausible resolution.

It&#x27;s especially amazing when compared to the other audio programs that try to mimic the hardware, literally, down to having a physics engine drive the UI and making users drag cables around. Ableton&#x27;s UI is a wonderful, straightforward, usable system. It reminds me a bit of the discreet logic software like combustion and inferno - doesn&#x27;t look like a &quot;native&quot; UI, but once you start using it you realise holy shit, this is totally optimized for workflow and pixels aren&#x27;t wasted on pointless chrome.<p>Ableton&#x27;s automation system is slick too, making it trivial to hookup any key/MIDI input to anything. I got coded up an Xbox360 controller to work with it and it took under 2 hours flat.<p>I&#x27;m just a bit concerned for Ableton, because Live 8 seemed to be the big release (almost 6 years ago?), and Live 9 was not <i>that</i> huge of a leap and 9.1 was mainly bugfixes?

OTOH I guess it&#x27;s good if they cede their massive headstart a bit as it&#x27;ll drive more competition :).<p>Ableton&#x27;s hardware controller is cool, but without actual pixel screens it seems rather weak compared to the Maschine stuff.

And I really preferred the Acid UI. It didn&#x27;t look as nice, being unapologetically Windows. But it never forced me to stop and think about how to do something, which Live certainly did.<p>In Acid you could just draw loops directly into an arrangement. This always seems complicated in Live, because of the switching between Session and Arrangement modes.<p>9 is mostly okay. I still think a lot of UI assumptions feel alien and not quite elegantly minimal. But having an open API is a big deal for users who want to do more than Mondrian-with-loops.

Since the service we provide is visual testing, we work with <i>a lot</i> of web development teams and automation teams. I&#x27;ve encountered different levels of unit tests and e2e tests and I can&#x27;t say there&#x27;s a single methodology to &quot;rule them all&quot;. Some test only specific pages, some browse the entire website, some load specific components to a separate page for unit testing, and some don&#x27;t. Some have their R&D team provide &quot;id&quot; to each element (which is set &quot;forever&quot;) so the automation team has a very easy time locating elements, and some have to &quot;make do&quot;. So on that matter, I think you should go with whatever gives you the best ROI.<p>The questions &quot;which elements to check?&quot; and &quot;how many things to validate?&quot; are exactly the questions for which there&#x27;s a really good and simple answer: use visual testing and validate everything with a single call. Got a signup page with multiple options and inputs? awesome. use visual testing on the page and voila, all the elements and data in the page are validated, no element-specific validation code required. In fact, you can flow through your application, use visual test on every page (or major event), and boom! You got dozens if not hundreds or more elements validated in a single swoop.<p>Applitools ( <a href=""https://www.applitools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.applitools.com</a> ) does an extremely good work in making visual testing trivial, so you can have full blown E2E validation on your website/webapp with almost no validation code actually written.

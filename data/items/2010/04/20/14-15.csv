If you don't ""get"" too many of the reasons why, then you probably aren't (yet) an abstractionist.<p>This also applies to languages and idioms in them.  If you grok SICP, you're probably an abstractionist (if you don't, I wouldn't say you necessarily aren't one).<p>The best self-test, and it's eerie when it happens, is that you design a greenfield (new) architecture and start building it, and then discover that it solves problems you didn't realize you had.  I suspect this requires a fair degree of experience: it happened to me in the mid-90s, having stared programming in 1978 ... although maybe I got a taste of it in 1992.  But it might have happened earlier if I'd had a chance to do a greenfields project earlier.<p>Some facility with abstract math is a good sign, e.g. can you do pure algebraic manipulation, especially outside the context of solving a real world problem?",1271775317

It doesn't ""have"" macros, it's <i>made</i> of macros. The whole language is made of macros and you are nearly begged to extend it with more grammar. Or you can throw theirs away and write your own for something. Or you can throw theirs away, take some of it as a base, and extend it.<p>It's a wild, wacky experiment that needs to be done. Whatever happens, we'll learn a lot.

For example, the theft and sale to a newspaper of UK MPs expenses details was illegal but not widely considered immoral.<p>I'd like to quote from [1] before continuing:<p>""Last year, an employee at Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that is one of Apple's biggest suppliers, committed suicide after being accused of stealing a prototype for the iPhone.<p>Sun Danyong, 25, was a university graduate working in the logistics department when the prototype went missing. An investigation revealed that the factory's security staff had beaten him, and he subsequently jumped to his death from the 12th floor of his apartment building.""<p>If you want to talk about the legality and morality of Apple trying its damnedest to keep trade secrets, then what is your opinion of Apple using a supplier which beats an employee suspected of theft/loss and pushes him to suicide?<p>Because, (morally speaking) that is far more reprehensible than a journalist getting a scoop by acquiring a trade secret through theft.<p>As to the way Gizmodo treated Gary, well, it sucks that he lost it but that's life, Apple should accept that in-field testing will lead to some losses.

It was the syntax of doing things the python way that allowed me to grok polymorphism and MVC despite programming in an OO language for .Net for years.  I find that if I want to learn a concept, the syntax is extremely helpful.  I also find that if I have to program quickly, syntax being close to how I think is also helpful, and will get frustrated having to make yet another translation of my thought into a syntax that wasn't well thought out.  I would also bet that a lot of people find a different syntax to intuitive, and others counter-intuitive than I do.  And I'm fine w/ that!  Just because there is difference doesn't mean there has to be division!",1271772763

The Repo 105 meant Lehman temporarily swapped assets (such as bonds) for cash. A Repo, or repurchasing agreement, is a way to borrow money. But an accounting rule allowed Lehman to book the transaction as a sale and reduce its reported borrowings, according to a report by the court-appointed Lehman bankruptcy examiner, a former federal prosecutor, last month.""",1271772234

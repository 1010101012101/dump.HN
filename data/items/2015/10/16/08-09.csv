Maybe the profoundly rightward shift in Fandango’s bell curve is just a moviegoer’s version of Stockholm syndrome.<p>This is called the Endowment Effect[1]. I suspect it happens when you spend a considerable amount of time picking the &quot;right&quot; movie.<p>Admitting to yourself that you made the wrong pick is harder than consoling yourself that it wasn&#x27;t so bad after all.<p>Often times the bias will manifest itself in the subtlest of ways--for example a survey of &quot;How would you rate the movie you picked?&quot; versus &quot;How would you rate the movie?&quot; can skew ratings positively in the case of the former.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect</a>",1444985994

10398187,comment,10396064,10398072,0,0,saiya-jin,,,"before I bought my D750, I was shooting with my bridge cameras (panasonic fz series), purely JPG. for this kind of work, irfan view is LIGHTING fast, miles and miles and miles ahead of anything else I&#x27;ve encountered. Autopano giga for panoramas (again, faster than anything else I saw on the market, including photoshop, and tons of options).<p>after this, started with RAWs, and I started using Lightroom. There are things I like a lot (quick interface for stuff intended, ie lens corrections, playing around with sliders). the thing is - I am not buying into Adobe&#x27;s workflow totally. I don&#x27;t want to load and edit all the files I take, meaning easily 100-300 from a weekend. First step is selecting interestin gones, maybe 20%.<p>I select few interesting quickly (irfan is still MUCH faster than doing it through lightroom), separate panoramas (Lightroom/Photoshop has very primitive interface without much control, plus their alghoritms are archaic and don&#x27;t work so well compared to what Autopano brings on), and then work in Lightroom on selected ones. I HATE the way Lightroom&#x27;s process is done - no flexibility outside of a narrow path.<p>You don&#x27;t want to use Catalog and manage things on your own? Don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ll keep annoying you every single time you start it.<p>You want to just export result into a normal format that doesn&#x27;t lose so much quality (ie PNG)? well get an external plugin, because who supports exotic formats like PNG in 2015, right? Are you effin&#x27; kidding me? this is THE software to process photos, and I cannot export a photo into most of the formats?<p>You actually want to join panorama, ie the most basic functionality expected from expensive software? well till now some versions just pointed you to expensive photoshop, if you had it. if not, bad luck, pay more! panorama joining feature is still pathetic in 2015, cropping out parts of photos without good reasons. Autopano just works, all the time.<p>Picture management is a joke, rotation, crop etc don&#x27;t feel like a primary tool. again, freeware tool brings much more productivity, not only because I am so used to it. It seems to me marketing guys were the ones designing this product.<p>Did I find something better for processing RAWs photo by photo (or in batch?). Nope. But for many other steps necessary for the process of shooting -> final ordered set of photos from the event, there are better, faster tools out there. And yes, LR is SLOW, on fast i5, 16 gigs or RAm and fast SSD. Irfan is so much faster when working with RAWs, it&#x27;s shameful.",1444985797

I get it, you have a job to do and no precious time to spend on learning new tools or deal with bugs. But even if you put in an hour every now and then, or check out how has Gimp/Darktable/Blender progressed in the year or two since you last touched it, you can help.<p>The guys who are working on these software most likely are not professional photographers or digital artists, they are programmers with a keen interest on the topic. They have limited time on their hands and they primarily target their own use cases. They don&#x27;t have big budgets like Adobe and other companies do.<p>I applaud OP taking the time and the effort to get comfortable with open source tools. He has contributed a few excellent blog posts on moving from proprietary pro software (I particularly liked the one where he describes what he did in Gimp to get comfortable coming from a Photoshop background). He&#x27;ll probably get in touch with the developers in one way or another, to give feedback or submit bug reports, perhaps even patches. This is valuable work!<p>Free software is a team effort, you need to chip in if you want to see things improve.",1444985772

Let&#x27;s say a coin flip right after the investors have put their money in determines if the company will continue as is or get shut down; if so the present value of the company is at most half what it will be after the coin flip, probably less. And the reality is that startup risks are massive.<p>Now add the time element, and your growth also need to reflect returns the investors could have gotten elsewhere.<p>The net result is that if your startup is valued at $1.7M today, then they&#x27;re saying they think it&#x27;ll be worth <i>far</i> more than that <i>assuming you succeed</i>.

10398067,comment,10392731,10396772,0,0,paulojreis,,,"I can tell we&#x27;re aligned regarding CSS architecture - and also regarding Angular. :)<p>The style guide you linked is very clear and concise in explaining why BEM is great without being a panacea - it&#x27;s ugly, but it&#x27;s simple, predictable and solves many of the issues which arise with CSS nature (e.g. everything in CSS is global). I also liked the emphasis on having BEM as a naming convention, no more.<p>Regarding how you introduce BEM, I would only:<p>* Reinforce the idea that a BEM compliant worflow would typically allow developers to change mark-up without having to look up stylesheets and vice-versa;<p>* Reinforce how much it would typically reduce side-effects!<p>I&#x27;d also give a few words on the topic of using the preprocessor (mixins, extends and, obviously, variables) to achieve DRYness.<p>* My argument to my team was to have readable semantic and obvious classnames (without style references in the name, e.g. no .blue-widget) which are &quot;composed&quot; via SASS (and SASS constructs might have style references in the name e.g. my-button @extends %blue-button);<p>* The other argument, and the one I actually believe `<i>philosophically</i> is that this allows you <i>transfer the object-composition duty from the browser to the build process</i>. It just makes sense to me: why have thousands of clients composing styles (e.g. button class=&quot;btn btn-lg btn-primary&quot;) when this is predictable ahead-of-time (button class=&quot;my-btn&quot;, where .my-btn = @make-btn(lg, primary)). This gives you performance and, as I said above, the possibility to have readable class names - I don&#x27;t exactly know what &quot;btn btn-lg btn-primary&quot; might be, but &quot;btn-login&quot; is quite obvious.<p>In your contributing guidelines I noticed you have @extends with classes (e.g.  @extend .mint-list). I use placeholders instead of classes to avoid side effects which are difficult to predict (even more so when you have a team with different levels of expertise). Here&#x27;s why: <a href=""http://csswizardry.com/2014/01/extending-silent-classes-in-sass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csswizardry.com/2014/01/extending-silent-classes-in-s...</a>.<p>I&#x27;d also reinforce the notion - as less experienced developers do this quite often - of the different concerns of HTML (structure) and CSS (style). Newcomers to HTML seem to believe that HTML is a GUI mark-up language and, ergo, it shouldn&#x27;t be problematic to use it as a presentational layer. As a practical example, &quot;newcomers&quot; usually have HTML elements only for presentational purposes, such as <div class=&quot;shadow&quot;> or a list item used as a divider between other list items. I usually spend a few minutes of my time explaining how to avoid this using e.g. :before and/or :after.",1444983100

10398063,comment,10397424,10397929,0,0,chipsy,,,"If you expand capacity in one mode but hold the other ones steady, you&#x27;re still running into Braess&#x27; paradox. It doesn&#x27;t matter that there is more bus capacity if people were tolerating the existing car congestion before. People will not switch until the roads are jam-packed.<p>The paradox still applies when we consider the Tokyo rail network. There&#x27;s lots of rail in Tokyo - it transports most of the commuters. Major lines are quite literally packed during rush hour. [0] Adding more rail will make the system even more popular, so the problem won&#x27;t get better.<p>OTOH consider congestion charges. When interviewed[1], individuals do not believe they were significantly affected by the introduction of a charge, even though overall traffic levels go down substantially, by one fifth in the example used of Stockholm.<p>What we are changing when we change capacities is not speed or comfort, but a preference for what kind of congestion we get and how cheaply it will be filled. If our only goal is congestion reduction we should not be looking at the roads at all.<p>The San Francisco area has plenty of car traffic, but more recently, within the past decade or so, the public transit has become extremely popular. This is not because the transit has gotten substantially better by quality or speed metrics. It is because the population is making more trips and longer ones, and the public transit systems were the last resort for capacity. Demand for new trips is in turn caused by available housing being located distantly from workplaces. If newcomers were able to live where they worked, congestion would drop significantly.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRBLnth4oSg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRBLnth4oSg</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC33HAq--x8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC33HAq--x8</a>",1444983056

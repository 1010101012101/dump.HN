Pushing a new language to all major browsers is hard, like you said. Maybe even impossible, several huge corporations with complex politics are involved.<p>Google is trying this approach with Dart, and I personally don't think it's the panacea, nor do I expect all major browsers to support it.<p>So the only alternative I see is to have a very flexible VM that can run pretty much any language. asm.js proves that JS is actually quite good at that. I'd still prefer something like native client, but asm.js is highly promising: It's downwards compatible and has some potential for optimisation at the same time.",1369292056

This is a technical community and it loves to propose technical solutions, but negative comments are a people problem first and foremost. If you wish to see this improve, be the change you wish to see. Exercise self discipline. Choose to not comment if it is trivial and negative. If you do say something trivial and negative, you have about an hour in which to change your mind and delete. Exercise that option if you think it does not add value. Set the example.",1369289412

5755557,comment,5755068,5755349,11,0,jckt,,,"I'm probably slightly biased here, having quite a few good friends that themselves are very involved with the manufacturing scene in China. From what I know and have seen, the apparently widespread cheating you mentioned is much rarer than you say. In many areas there is serious friction between (corrupt) government and business, and it is mostly under such situations where I've known about ""non-standard business practices"".<p>That said, if you're white, then I would be more inclined to believe the incidences of fraud you've experienced. I still don't believe it's a majority, but the incidences of foreigner-exploitation in China is significant enough to turn away a lot of potential business. I don't think it's really racism per se, as I think amongst many Chinese, especially the less well-educated, they believe that for reasons of history, foreigners, especially Caucasians, owe them something -- ""after all, didn't you guys plunder our country's treasures 100, 200 years ago?"" (8 nation alliance, Opium Wars, World War II, etc). It's irrational and this is no excuse or justification of their disgusting behaviour, but I think this is what's happening in many cases.<p>Still, there seems to be a slightly Sinophobic slant to these articles. Stuxnet (I think most people believe it's American/Israeli?) is just evidence of how far the Pentagon has gone with hacking. Its sophistication is actually amazing, and I while most may claim that ""hacking Iran is beneficial for the rest of the world"", I don't think the consequent fear of American hacking prowess is irrational at all. Is China's decision to ramp up their own cyber-espionage the right thing to do? I don't know. But I believe that any look at the history of international politics will show that nobody really gives a shit about international law whenever it becomes inconvenient. China is hardly a ""victim"", as they claim, but the narrative of ""Chinese hackers rising"" that's so popular these days distracts us from the much-more formidable power that our Pentagon already has.",1369288869

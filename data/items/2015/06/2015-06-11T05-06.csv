9697875,comment,9692499,9694952,0,0,jlarocco,,,"I posted a response to a similar comment somewhere else a while back, which I&#x27;m copy/pasting here:<p>It could just be my experience, but from what I’ve seen, a lot of Lisp coders treat advanced macro programming like magic. It’s one of those things you “can” do, but rarely “should,” precisely because it’s so easy to misuse and potentially difficult to understand. There are some popular libraries (like Iterate) that use macros to do far out stuff, but most people write macros themselves pretty infrequently. Even Paul Graham, in “On Lisp” suggests writing macros, “when nothing else will do,” like when conditional evaluation is required.<p>On the other hand, my experience with Ruby was that everybody wanted to do meta-programming everywhere because it was the hot new thing and made Ruby like Lisp, and made you look smart and clever. The more a person could abuse meta-programming to twist the language, the better.<p>For example, here’s a Ruby tutorial explaining how to use method_missing to auto-generate methods that match a regular expression, and at the end: “we’ve created an extremely expressive and beautiful API that is DRY and easy to maintain.”",1434002341

I started on an HP3000 mainframe in 1976, if you want to go back to the very beginning, writing BASIC programs on a teletype or one of the two early CRTs, and storing my programs on paper tape.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve worked in DOS, 16-bit Windows, 32-bit Windows, 64-bit Windows, Ubuntu, iOS, and Android, using Pascal, 8086 assembler, C, C++, C#, javascript, Python, and Java. I&#x27;ve worked on applications in multimedia, telephony, banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, health care, and I&#x27;m sure a few other things I&#x27;ve forgotten.<p>All of which will mean jack squat if, tomorrow morning, the most important thing I have to do is invert a binary tree. But I&#x27;m fairly certain I would be able to figure out what I needed to do, and I am fairly certain I could manage to implement it well. It&#x27;s what we&#x27;re supposed to be able to do, and if you think that having studied up on it so that you could pass a Google interview means that, a few years down the road when you actually need it you&#x27;ll just whip it off the top of your head, then I think life may hold some surprises for you.",1434002287

To get a standard, you have to have a situation where the value of cooperation is higher than the cost.<p>There are plenty of people <i>now</i> who need to solve the container problem, but Googlers been working on this shit for years, before it was really on anyone else&#x27;s horizon. Google employees incepted the cgroup feature way back in 2006, to solve problems that were already being felt acutely at that time within Google. Folks have been working on this stuff a long time before it mattered to anyone else, and that&#x27;s why what&#x27;s coming out is software rather than standards. There is no way a big company is going to delay solutions to an urgent strategic problem in order to be part of a democratic process for the sake of a few people&#x27;s ideals. Maybe if they&#x27;d seen it coming five or ten years in advance, to give enough time for the standardization process to occur, but Google was far too small and the future far too uncertain in 2001 to predict what might be needed in 2006.",1434002136

9697862,comment,9696397,9696947,0,0,sytelus,,,"There are some infrastructure Governments must do because it provides equal opportunity setting the level playing field for all. For instance, Govt must fund schools otherwise all the great schools would eventually set their prices according to supply/demand so that bottom population can&#x27;t afford them. This translates to situation where you can realize your potential only if you were lucky enough to be born to right parents.<p>Consider another scenario: A country has cities A, B and C. Assume that the govt doesn&#x27;t do infrastructure like building roads. So a private company comes in and builds road between A and B because there is a net profit for them. One problem is obviously, now everyone must pay to use this road. If you are poor and can&#x27;t pay then you can&#x27;t use that road even if you need it go to hospital or send your kids to school or start your new business. Again, the result is that lack of infrastructure puts poor people at the severe disadvantage from making progress.<p>Further, private companies may decide never to build any road between B and C because their analysis shows C only has 1000 people and they can never recover their cost. Now, you can argue that 1000 people needs to suffer for making a bad choice about where to live and should not expect other people to pay up. However if you go in that line of thought, I bet most of the cities would never could have been connected. The crux of the issue is we as humans are only good at finding &quot;local optimums&quot; and it&#x27;s impossible to see for us what could be &quot;global optimum&quot;. What that means in nutshell is that we need to <i>allow</i> possibilities even though it may look venture of loss and foolishness because sometime those possibilities are what leads to huge outcomes.",1434002093

9697858,comment,9697130,9697676,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> <i>What I really don&#x27;t get is that they choose these 5 subreddits to ban, reddit has at least 50 (and probably more) subreddits that are arguably a lot more offensive than the ones they just blocked.</i><p>I think this is the key thing that&#x27;s really got everyone all in a tizzy. There are a pile of subreddits that the vast majority of Reddit users would <i>like</i> to see gone: topics that aren&#x27;t just politically divisive, but are offensive for the sake of being offensive. Instead, the only thing that&#x27;s consistent about Reddit&#x27;s decisions to police subreddits is that it&#x27;s inconsistent. Reddit&#x27;s administration looks like they&#x27;re generally OK with whatever&#x27;s on the site up until it gets some kind of exposure elsewhere and only then does it get banned, and then the reasons given for it don&#x27;t make any sense given the site as a whole.<p>I think Reddit is actually in a unique position to start cleaning up their site. They don&#x27;t have any real competition at the moment and they have a huge userbase. They could probably institute and enforce new <i>consistent</i> site-wide policies and actually get away with it. But this blindfolded &quot;pin the ban on the subreddit&quot; game is only succeeding in irritating their users and making the admins look ham-handed.<p>On a side note, I was a little disappointed to see kn0thing&#x27;s name prominently on the announcement. He&#x27;s always seemed like a smart, level-headed guy. I&#x27;d genuinely love to hear from him how the subreddit banning policy makes any kind of sense. (Alexis, are you lurking here?)",1434002043

And suburban life brings with it the long commute, the length of which is a better predictor of happiness (negatively, of course) than almost any other demographic factor, including income, marital status, house size, or any of the other things people think make their hour and change in a car every day worth it.",1434001953

An organization hiring those individuals should be set up to mitigate that damage and gently steer them in the right direction, not crucify them publicly.

That becomes harder under concurrency.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about a gen_server, the state is per process, and once the process has switched to the new code, it won&#x27;t go back, so there&#x27;s no problem with old code and new state. In non gen_server code, you do need to be careful about when you hit a boundary that gets you into new code; you&#x27;d typically want it to be your process&#x27;s main loop, since that usually tail recurses and doesn&#x27;t leave a stack in the old code. It is difficult to reason about a situation where you call into new code, and that returns to old code; it&#x27;s much better to avoid it.<p>The concurrent case is OK too, each process manages its own state, and upgrades it when it switches to new code.  Are you thinking about changes to messages that are being passed and/or global state? In that case, like with any distributed system, you need to load in stages: first load code that can handle old and new messages, then trigger sending new messages (code load or config setting), then load code that only handles new messages.",1434001139

Unlike real programming languages, you can get a lot of value out of R without really coding. Its a great statistical calculator and has good graphics. Then you can move relatively easily into scripting a few repetitive tasks, and then on into writing simple programs.<p>One consequence of that is that R has a lot of &#x27;non-programmer programmers&#x27;, statisticians and domain experts. Some of them write libraries that encode their domain knowledge. Then over time that adds up to having library support for more different types of analysis than any other language. I personally dislike R as a language, but I often end up using it because it has a library for some task that just doesn&#x27;t exist in Python.",1434000231

Likewise, being able to deal with an issue isn&#x27;t a binary either, as there are many levels of dealing with something. You&#x27;re misreading me totally if you think I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s impossible to have a seminar without political volatility (and frankly, putting words in my mouth).<p>> <i>No, you were defending the rights of conference organizers...</i><p>Once again, for the cheap seats: there&#x27;s no such thing as a talk free of politics. Just because the seminar content itself is not political doesn&#x27;t mean that there&#x27;s no politics involved. If the conference organisers don&#x27;t want to be associated with a technically proficient but politically bigoted speaker, why should they be shamed into accepting the speaker? Why does the freedom of expression of the speaker trump the freedom of expression of the conference organisers? As I said, conferences are not public services.<p>Put another way: If I was to organise a conference (and all the work that entails), it&#x27;d be a cold fucking day in hell before I would be shamed by stealth bigots who try to cow me into taking a speaker who I found repulsive, personally or politically. It&#x27;s my damn conference, and I&#x27;m trying to present a certain theme in a certain context. Random speakers don&#x27;t have the right to have their freedom of expression exerted over my freedom of expression - at <i>my</i> conference, <i>I</i> am the big dog. Other people are free to hold their own conferences. If potential speakers want to be bigot in a way I have a problem with, well, that&#x27;s one of the social costs they pay for having those opinions. Diddums.<p>Inviting speakers also carries a professional association with that speaker - again, the idea that politics doesn&#x27;t matter for a seminar is false. There are a ton of speakers out there; who you choose does have an affect on your own reputation.<p>And keep in mind that most conference talks are <i>not</i> locked-in when the speaker is invited. The organisers frequently don&#x27;t even have a title for a speaker&#x27;s talk when the invites go out, let alone the content. How, then, are organisers meant to invite on seminar-merit-free-of-reputation?<p>> <i>Examples, please?</i><p>You&#x27;ve been on HN for four years now, surely you can remember some.

But then maybe people thought the same thing leading up to the French revolution &#x27;only&#x27; 200 years ago?  From my limited knowledge, the French had a stable aristocracy with a controlled populace.  And then just a few years later the new powers were executing tens of thousands of citizens.

The defaults are representative of the userbase of the site, and their values seep into every crevice. Furthermore, Reddit has never actually been about &quot;free speech&quot;. The vast, vast majority of people who browse Reddit don&#x27;t do it because they can say whatever they want; they do it because it&#x27;s an esay way to aggregate and consume light content. I mean, this should be obvious to anyone who uses Reddit with any frequency. The people who trot out the free speech defense — at least from what I routinely see on the site itself — are often exactly the ones who enjoy reading vile subs like /r/fatpeoplehate.<p>If Reddit can&#x27;t survive this cleanup, then good fucking riddance.",1433999035

Roads are a primary part of that infrastructure. If I could see how fast and conveniently goods and people are moving within a country, state, I could tell you how developed it is. I believe this has always been true. The old nations which had better ways of moving goods also had great power to some extent.<p>Other parts of this basic infrastructure the government should provide include: a legal system, protection, education and healthcare. Perhaps beyond this the government can keep clear and let private markets handle.",1433999005

A degree from one university, for all intents and purposes, is equal to another.<p>I go to a fairly good school for Software Engineering with a good reputation, but definitely not the best (by some standards). A lot of people consider Waterloo to be the ""best"" CS/Software Eng. school in Canada, but I end up getting the exact same degree. I've done the same courses, with some brilliant minds behind the podium.<p>Mind you, my choice was also on the environment surrounding the program. The impression I had when I visited Waterloo was fairly bad. The campus is a huge sprawl, and not too many people on campus looked like they were having a good time. My tour guide, a software engineer, told us that Waterloo was the only place to go if I wanted to get a good job when I graduated. As well, beyond residences on campus, there wasn't a whole lot of housing surrounding the campus. Students are sprawled out around, leading to (in my opinion) not the true university experience.<p>I'm currently a tour guide for my program, and I usually get the question: ""Why would I go here when I can go to Waterloo?"". First of all, I know this guy/girl is probably being forced to look at other schools as a backup plan, and I also know that I have about 60 seconds to state my case before he/she loses interest.<p>My university was one of the first in Canada to have a Software Eng. program, and had several interesting ""sub""-degrees with Software Eng & Game Design and Software Eng & Embedded Systems. The campus is beautiful and fairly compact--you can get from the furthest point in the campus to the other side in less than 10 minutes. People are socializing outside. In the spring, the field in the middle of campus is full of people having picnics and playing pick-up soccer, football, and cricket.<p>I tell the student that it's not so much about where you'll be in 4-5 years, but how you get there that's important. University was my first taste of the world, and I'd much rather have a good experience transitioning to the working world than asking myself about what I actually did in the past few years.",1296431749

Time and again I've found that people I work with from $BIG_NAME tend to <i>not</i> be the best performers.<p>Often they operate with presumption that they should be in top positions, but rarely do the kinds of crap work that would actually earn them that slot. This can cause tons of friction in a team and I've personally found it better to try and not have people from $BIG_NAME on the team if I can help it.<p>I've also found that they are rarely innovators or out-of-the-box thinkers. They tend to be conformists and try to execute within the given rule set to the best of their ability.<p>However, I think perhaps my anecdotal experience runs contrary to the fact of how many SV types come from $BIG_NAME.<p>Perhaps it's the circles I tend to work in, selecting less from $BIG_NAME and more from $LOCAL_STATE_SCHOOL...perhaps all the folks from $BIG_NAME are people I'm seeing who have slid quite down the ladder with respect to their peers and aren't star performers no matter what.<p>Back in my college days at $LOCAL_STATE_SCHOOL I did notice that there were very few SV companies recruiting there and many more of the huge defense contractor type. It was alarmingly easy to get an internship at one of those huge companies and disappear into a long, but often reasonably rewarding career in the government. Some of the problems the government works on are impressively hard (see SV darling Palantir for an example) and there's no shortage of incredible people I've met who decidedly didn't go to $BIG_NAME and do fantastic, mind-blowing stuff.<p>I think early in your career it can mean something.

It only works if all the upstream equipment has infinite capacity.  If you (and others like you) use 275GB instead of 10GB then it absolutely does cause more equipment to have to be installed upstream, which I don't think is an insignificant cost.<p>I'm like the GP - I wish every connection was metered, the problem is not metering, but the rate which invariably seems to be way above what is reasonable.  Metering seems to always just be a cynical strategy to exploit naive users who don't know how much bandwidth they consume (bill shock, etc) rather than a rational economic way of sharing a limited resource.",1296429437

Wealthy to me might be $100,000/year if I'm living in the mid-west.

There are opportunities all around us every day.  If you aren't educated enough to act on it, it will pass you by/you won't even be able to recognize it as an opportunity.<p>With Internet the being so prevalent, you could easily learn a new skill online, without ever having to pay exorbitant education fees. (MIT has free coursework available).  Every city I've lived in has had free Internet access through the library.  There are no more excuses.  If you aren't physically or mentally incapable, you can succeed if you put in the effort.<p>""so let me give you a counter example: you work very hard in your company as a senior developer. Once day the boss comes and tells you you're fired because he's hired his son to do your job.""<p>The boss owns the company.  If he wants to hire his son, it's his freedom.  If I was a senior developer, I probably would have the skills to easily find a job somewhere else.  In a few months, when the boss realizes his son can't do the job, it will be too late.  If it isn't, I will need a much higher salary to come back.<p>""Now you're on unemployment for months due to an economic downturn, but because there are no income taxes you get no unemployment benefits.""<p>So when did I say we should have no taxes?

The good news is, it's curable. The bad news is the treatment is prohibitively expensive""<p>Treatment is expensive no matter what.  The difference is that either the government pays the cost (IE: the tax payers) pr your insurance company pays for it.  My problem with all of the current universal health care advocates is that they propose plans that assume medical care is an infinite resource.  There needs to be some way to limit doctor visits or people will be coming into the office many more times than they should (because hey, it's free I'm paying for it).  There needs to be overall limits in place and after those limits are hit (maybe a yearly visit limit), you need to pay out of pocket.  If we got rid of the insurance companies altogether, the hospitals wouldn't be able to charge $100 for a bottle of aspirin.<p>Another point I would like to make is that in pretty much all countries with socialized medicine, there are long waiting lines for things like cancer treatments.  I have many older relatives that live in Canada that have had to come over to the US because they weren't able to get treatments in time.<p>""so like all of the losers in society's Randian economic game, we're going to expect you to simply die gracefully in a cardboard box somewhere out of sight.

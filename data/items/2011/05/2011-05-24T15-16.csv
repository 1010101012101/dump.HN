2580350,comment,2577095,2578952,1,0,kenjackson,,,"I think the media didn't understand this based on that article.  See: <a href=""http://girtby.net/archives/2005/08/17/microsoft-patents-ipod-or-something-else-entirely/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://girtby.net/archives/2005/08/17/microsoft-patents-ipod...</a><p>Apple couldn't file for a patent after it released the iPod.  You have to do it before public disclosure.  And of course MS couldn't have gotten the patent if Apple had released the iPod.<p>To bring in the Groklaw quote mentioned:<p>""The rejected Apple application is not exactly a critical one. It also doesn't appear that the Microsoft patent covers the subject matter of the Apple application, rather it was used as an example to deny the Apple application because it isn't an original idea.<p>Platt's application covers a way to automatically generate playlists from songs similar to one or more song manually chosen by the user. As an example of usage, Platt described a portable music player that uses a menu hierarchy for navigation. The menus aren't really the invention though.<p>The Apple application, on the other hand, is all about hierarchical menus. Yes, seriously, that's what they were trying to patent, the idea of using a tree of menus to operate a portable music player. Can you believe it? (I knew you could.) I'd chalk this rejection up to an example of the USPTO doing some good.<p>The rejected Apple application is 10/282,861 - Graphical user interface and methods of use thereof in a multimedia player<p>The Platt application is 10/158,674 - Auto playlist generation with multiple seed songs""<p>This makes a LOT more sense.  The Apple patent was rejected because it wasn't an invention.  And the MS patent went through because it was actually patenting something that wasn't in the iPod.",1306252772

2580340,comment,2579744,2579744,4,0,vbtemp,,,"For me, at least, once I understand it, the notation makes perfect sense and I find it far more expeditious and precise to express my idea in the domain language of the field.  The problem is that getting to the point of becoming proficient in the formalism of a field can take an extremely long time (for me), and has the unfortunate side effect of making me feel like a total idiot for not understanding it sooner, once I understand it.<p>The fact is, mathematics deals with constructs with extremely specific properties. These properties can be completely and soundly stated without ambiguity quite succinctly in the formalism of the field. Once I'm comfortable with the formalism, trying to express it in English is awkward, imprecise, and generally just extremely verbose.  It can then be a frustrating experience going back and convey the idea to colleagues or others in prose.<p>When I come across some academic mathematics paper, even if I'm somewhat familiar with the field, I generally find other things far more interesting, like the coffee stain on the floor. Effectively reading a mathematics paper requires a print out and a pencil to work through some of the definitions and take notes for yourself, and maintaining laser-like focus for a sustained period of time (more intense than programming a rather difficult problem, imo).",1306252660

I don't disagree with either class of posts, but they are, strictly speaking, quite political.<p>I think making ""no politics ever"" a rule can hamper discussions quite a lot. I can understand why it's not productive to talk about, say, the merits of Obama's health care bill, which evokes really partisan gut reactions and makes people more likely to start posting pithy political slogans that sound good and make for horrible discussion. But talking about a reduced crime rate without crediting/blaming any particular politician or party can be pretty interesting to talk about.<p>On the other hand, I don't think any of the anti-DRM or anti-anti-piracy posts are very productive.

Then the mathematician has to relentlessly practice communicating those results first to other professional mathematicians, helping them to see the connections between their research and the new research results. Mathematicians who work hard at communicating with other mathematicians, Thurston says, can help greatly with the progress of mathematical research.<p>After edit: Paul Halmos, quite a well regarded mathematician who by his own self-evaluation was not in the same league as Fields medalists, wrote in his ""automathography""<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/I-Want-Be-Mathematician-Automathography/dp/0387960783/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/I-Want-Be-Mathematician-Automathograph...</a><p>that he learned a lot of mathematics as he continued his career after his Ph.D. degree by ""reading the first ten pages of a lot of mathematics books."" Sometimes he could only get ten pages into a book by another mathematician before he was lost, but by reading dozens and dozens of books, ten pages each, he gained more conceptual foundations in more areas of mathematical research and could gradually apply what he self-learned to advance his own research. I strongly encourage students I know to follow that same strategy of reading at least the introductory portion of many books on subjects they desire to know. Don't just read what your professor assigns you to read. Go to the library and read widely. Read as far as you can before you get stuck, and then find another book and start reading it from the beginning until you get stuck again.

In Nottingham a 2-bedroom terraced house in a good area can be rented for 500 a month and in a bad area 300, a whole year's bus travel is 350, or 199 for 100 days of your choosing, and there are extensive cycle lanes. There' s lots of fun stuff going on , varied nightlife. Its under 2 hours on the train to London when you need to go. To me this is the sort of place people should be doing startups, not London. 18k salary here would get you a reasonable existence for a few years while in a startup company.
It seems to me to start a startup one has to have some basic business sense which means one understands balancing ingoings and outgoings. Therefore it seems a bit flawed to try to start a company somewhere so insanely expensive that, like you say, its employees spend 70%-80% on accommodation. Its rather important to retain key early technical staff. Not very easy for that to happen in London.",1306251980

2580096,comment,2579468,2579584,2,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>It is literally the largest collection of human knowledge ever assembled.</i><p>I think that's called Google. And one of the big weaknesses of Wikipedia, at least in English[0], is that few Wikipedia editors go beyond Google or their own personal experience in sourcing articles. There is a huge amount of well curated information that still exists only in research libraries. Even though Google has made efforts to digitize that information, various technical and legal barriers make it hard to make that information generally available, and anyway most Wikipedia editors don't look up most of that information.<p>[0]The problem that Wikipedia has in many other languages (but less so in German than in most languages) is that the articles are mostly cribbed from the English articles, and the English articles are not very well sourced. I read several other languages, and two others besides English well enough to use those languages for professional research, and I often trace Wikipedia interwiki links to see what articles in other languages say about the subject I have researched most thoroughly over the last two decades. The English version of Wikipedia tends to set the tone and provide most of the references for many other language versions of Wikipedia.<p>Another problem that Wikipedia has, as Wikipedia reports, is an ""unsustainable"" decline in the number of administrators willing to help the project actively.<p><a href=""http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Wikimedia_Editors#Chapter_Three:_The_future_.282007-present.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Wikimedia_Editor...</a><p>The Wikimedia Foundation points out that if the number of articles grows while the number of administrators shrinks, it will be very hard for Wikipedia to meet the foundation's stated goal of improving article quality.<p>All of the above being said, I am a Wikipedian because I thought the original vision of Wikipedia made sense, and I have liked using Wikipedia as a reference resource from time to time. But in my efforts to volunteer to the project and give back to the editing community, I have discovered the problems I just mentioned above. Those problems need to be fixed for Wikipedia truly to rise to world heritage status.<p>After edit: I might as well edit here, after taking a look at the other comments. Maybe my point of view is old-fashioned, having been educated for two postsecondary degrees at a large research university, but to date, for sure, any large university library has much more total information inside than ALL of Wikipedia, in all languages combined. (One quick way to verify this would be to do something that German Wikipedia has attempted to do, namely to make its complete content available to a print publisher.) Wikipedia as a whole still contains a lot less information, and rather more poorly curated information, than any research university's library. So if there is a claim just on the basis of aggregate information collection size for regarding Wikipedia as a world heritage site, there is a much stronger claim for that for any well administered university library.<p>One thing each of you can do to get a reality check on Wikipedia is to look up several articles on some subject that you know very well, a subject that you have taken care to research thoroughly in other sources, and see how long it takes to find something to fix in the Wikipedia articles. That Wikipedia is an online resource ""anyone can edit"" was a bold social experiment, and it has proven to be a largely successful experiment, but when I want do serious research on any subject related to my occupation or to my family's health or well-being, I still turn to sources beyond Wikipedia, because Wikipedia today is nowhere near inclusive enough of the best information in the world to be relied on without double-checking other sources.<p>P.P.S. Last edit to this post (I think): Wikipedia is user-editable over long time spans, as several commenters here have mentioned. HN threads are not as long-lasting, and each post has a short edit window. Does anyone have any reliable sources<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS</a><p>that suggest that any of the factual statements I have made in this post are untrue?

The precise details of what happened are a bit fuzzy at this point, as is often the case with very painful events in life. It may have merely ""forgotten"" where to find all the music and emptied the library. And, it may be that the actual file deletions happened on the iPod rather than the PC (I'm still pretty sure it deleted files on the PC, though). I remember being furious and confused by the behavior of the software...and I remember having to re-rip several albums that I hadn't backed up lately, and I lost a few mixtapes that someone had made for me.<p>That reminds me of another thing I <i>hated</i> about iTunes...it was always re-indexing its library. All the damned time. Every time I would start it, it would go galloping all over my PC (this was back in the days when I had three or four hard disks, plus a file server) for like 30 minutes.<p>Regardless of the specifics, iTunes made an enemy for life out of me by being so damned confusing, and so hostile to my existing workflow. I'd been using digital music for a decade before iTunes came along, and iTunes just did not fit into how I'd been using it.",1306249343

I'm especially impressed by the size of it.  I want to know more, so I go to <a href=""http://bn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bn.com</a> and I'm greeted with the equivalent of chirping crickets.  Nowhere on their main page is this new Nook mentioned.  The Nook Color is displayed front and center though.<p>So I click on the Nook link from the side menu.  You get the Nook Color and the old Nook side by side.  Not even a link to a press release suggesting a new version even exists.  I scoured their site and couldn't find word one about the new Nook.<p>If this were Amazon, the new Nook would be plastered front and center on their main page with a personal letter from Jeff Bezos about how excited he is.  They'd prominently display the price, availability dates and be taking pre-orders right this second.  Apple does the same thing with new product: front and center and (usually) available now.<p>But I have no idea when the new Nook will be available, or the full details on weight and measurements.  And I'm probably not going to keep checking back to see when they eventually update the site.  BN basically just lost an impulse sale.",1306249280

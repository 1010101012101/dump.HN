In my town the city tried a neat rule for garbage men: finish your route and you can go home, but we'll pay you the full-time wage.

285375,comment,285303,285303,0,0,webwright,,,"Amen to the ""don't outsource UI"" concept.  However, I'd disagree with the common misconception that you can sprinkle magical UI dust once the project is largely done.<p>For most projects, I think you need a user-experience designer/advocate on the team from day 1...  Which, incidentally, is when the best UI guys are looking for jobs-- the idea of coming in and playing design/UX cleanup on an existing app is a helluva lot less fun than being involved from the get-go.",1219607561

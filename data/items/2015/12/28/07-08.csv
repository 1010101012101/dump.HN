10800330,comment,10798408,10798408,0,0,MartinRogalla,,,"Have been doing iOS programming with Swift 2.5 days per week for a bit less than a year now. The first step I took was to read through Apple&#x27;s Official Swift Language Guide[0]. After completing this I followed the Stanford course on iOS Development with Swift[1]. I didn&#x27;t spend much time on this, I did this in a Friday afternoon(language guide) and full weekend(watching lectures), since I believe more in learning by practicing.<p>I&#x27;ve really come to like Swift as a language, since it&#x27;s concise and simple. The iOS SDK however is not so much fun. Learning the iOS SDK will take a lot of time before you develop routines to approach your problems. I&#x27;m still learning about strange behaviour from the SDK and getting frustrated by it every time I use it. It&#x27;s important to keep things fun, look through the trending Swift repositories on GitHub, follow #iosdev on Twitter and /r/iosprogramming, you will learn a lot if you keep up to date with these sources.<p>Some of the habits I&#x27;ve created, which might be handy to other people:<p>- I manage dependencies with CocoaPods, with no dependencies residing in my repository.<p>- I don&#x27;t use storyboards or xib&#x27;s at all. Everything I do is with SnapKit[2]. This takes some time to learn, but it greatly improves the diffs and overview on how the ui elements are constrained and set up.<p>- I use API endpoint enums which get called by an API Handler, which uses Alamofire[3] to execute the api requests.<p>- I try to use as many tools provided by Fastlane[4]. Especially if you&#x27;re developing many Apps, or incrementally building an App, releasing a new version every two weeks: automate all the things. Otherwise you will waste so much time simply waiting for a process to complete.<p>Side note(if you&#x27;re interested):<p>I&#x27;m currently developing a tool called Evans(will write a blog post as soon as it&#x27;s reasonably finished), which performs all kinds of routines automatically. It for example listens to GitHub comments like &#x27;@evans screenshots&#x27; on a pull request. Evans then emits a request to one of the build slaves, which retrieves the branch, builds the project and runs the screenshot routine, puts the screenshots in an s3 bucket and posts a link as a response in the pull request.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID309"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/...</a><p>[1] - <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swi...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire</a><p>[4] - <a href=""https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane</a>",1451289215

So I eschewed all the Flux stuff and just used a single nested record of app state updated with the simple built-in immutability helper. We put everything in just two or three files so we didn&#x27;t need any complex build tooling. We did routing by just listening to hash change events. We got up and running very quickly and fleshed out the app in a couple of months with no major problems. Later we&#x27;ve started using some stuff, but we did it gradually according to real needs.<p>So when I see people starting their projects by configuring dozens of tools and technologies that they don&#x27;t really need up front, I wonder why they don&#x27;t just start simple.",1451289182

The first project which ended up (finally) with a pretty sorry excuse for a light rail system between downtown Seattle and the airport, was constructed only after intense lobbying against which was, for a time, a much more popular (and extensive) monorail project. Several referendums were conducted over the course of about seven or eight years starting in the mid-nineties, and they went something like this:<p>1. Referendum for light rail - passes.<p>(much faffing about)<p>2. Referendum for monorail instead - passes.<p>(faffing about)<p>3. Another referendum for monorail - passes.<p>(faffing about)<p>4. Yet another fucking referendum for monorail - barely passes.<p>(faffing about)<p>5. One last referendum to actually go ahead and, you know, build the damn thing, amidst heavy lobbying against - fails.<p>And then Seattle gets a shitty light rail system that no one uses and hardly goes anywhere. Strangely, the moneyed interests that lobbied most against the monorail, become even more moneyed. And meanwhile, <i>of course</i>, other forms of public transportation i.e. buses have been allowed to rot.<p>And then right at the tail end of that mess came the earthquake, and the pressing need to overhaul/replace the AWV, and pretty much all the same political fuckery came out and made a total mess of that process in pretty much the same fashion as it had public transport.<p>I think, at the end of the day, there is a perception - and it is not totally incorrect - that there are a lot of registered voters in other parts of Washington State, particularly the eastern half of the state, who hate the Seattle metro area and the people who live there, and that this is reflected in the state government, and that when it comes time for infrastructure projects which will help to grow that part of the state which contributes most to Washington&#x27;s economy, there is little political will in the state government to do the right thing. And so the success of Seattle is often in spite of the apathy, and occasionally even the active antipathy, of the rest of the state.",1451288621

Coming from Angular previously ($watch? isolate scope?? transclusion???), it was a breath of fresh air. It might also be due to my avoidance of certain rabbit holes that are prevalent around React.<p>One of those being the React community&#x27;s love affair with immutability (immutable.js, Redux, etc). JavaScript is not itself designed around the concept of immutability. Mixing the concepts has only led me to fight with the language and the existing ecosystem. Immutable patterns work best in a world where most things are immutable to begin with, not when you&#x27;re trying to coerce a world of mutable tools to be immutable.<p>I&#x27;ll admit, walking on some of these landmines initially was pretty painful, but I&#x27;ve been working with large codebases in React (SPAs and projects with tens of thousands lines of code) that I feel I&#x27;ve discovered the right paths to take. Here&#x27;s my takeaways for modern frontend projects using React:<p>- Keep code organized in modules (a la CommonJS) so code doesn&#x27;t become a big ball of mud.<p>- Use React Router to enforce that organization.<p>- Stick to vanilla JS- ES5/ES6/ES7--it&#x27;s better documented.<p>- Use Grunt, and then add in Gulp when needed, otherwise you&#x27;ll be writing a lot more boilerplate.<p>- Use Browserify, not Webpack--it doesn&#x27;t try to do everything.<p>- Use a reactive data paradigm to keep data flow simple (observables, e.g. Mobservable works really well) instead of Flux/Redux/*ux.<p>- Stick to real CSS and use namespaces (or web components), not React&#x27;s hijacked inlined version of it.<p>These practices have helped the teams I&#x27;ve worked in get stuff done and have scaled quite well.",1451288261

One of the things that constantly frustrates me on my desktop computer is my inability to run untrusted third-party code outside my browser.  The desktop was simply not built to do that, and I wish it was.  I&#x27;m currently judging games made for the 34th Ludum Dare game jam, and the way I do it safely is by creating a completely separate user account in Windows, and playing the games there.  This is inconvenient.  I&#x27;m not going to play the games under my normal account, because I simply don&#x27;t trust the code, but Windows gives me no other option.  I know my paranoia puts me in the minority, because after the jam is over, I uninstall Java and Flash and the other &quot;high-risk&quot; pieces of software, and I&#x27;m pretty sure most other people don&#x27;t do that.<p>On the other hand, the recent SIP lockdown on OS X and the way it&#x27;s affected dtrace is not something to be ignored either.

There is some amount of power that flows from just making tons of money, as Apple/Facebook/Google all do, and some amount of power that flows from having information and exploiting it (above the money that you made from that information).<p>A good example of the latter is using social graphs for very targeted campaigns to sway voters, which only appeared in the 2008 and 2012 elections. [1]<p>Apple does have all that personal data too -- your device usage patterns, location, app installs, browsing habits, e-mail, calendar, etc.  It just seems like they use it less (for the time being).  They have the potential to capitalize on that, but haven&#x27;t done it to a great extent.<p>Your point is taken -- Apple has a more lucrative business in selling devices than Google or Facebook have in pure information.  Although, I don&#x27;t necessarily think this is fundamental, and it could  easily change in the next 5-10 years.  I expect information to continue to become more important and more lucrative.<p>I don&#x27;t think the fact that Apple makes more money from devices necessarily refutes the idea that information is the new oil.  I guess you could say that computer hardware is fundamental too, in that basically everybody needs it, but I don&#x27;t really think it is as fundamental as information or oil.<p>I guess what happened with both information and oil is that a small group of companies monopolized them.  If you choose not to use Facebook, there is not a great alternative, because your friends aren&#x27;t there.  Similarly, there are few alternatives to many of Google&#x27;s services.  In the case of oil, control was through mechanisms like OPEC and Western military power.<p>Apple has had tremendous success with computer hardware, but they don&#x27;t have a monopoly.  I don&#x27;t think the computer hardware business is as prone to monopolies as software and information.<p>[1] Not sure if these are the best articles, but voter targeting as a new and advancing technology is pretty well documented:<p><a href=""http://bigthink.com/age-of-engagement/obama-2012-the-most-micro-targeted-campaign-in-history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigthink.com/age-of-engagement/obama-2012-the-most-mi...</a><p><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-obama-campaign-won-the-race-for-voter-data/2013/07/28/ad32c7b4-ee4e-11e2-a1f9-ea873b7e0424_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-obama-campai...</a><p>Also see : <a href=""http://www.dailydot.com/politics/search-engine-manipulation-effect-election/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailydot.com/politics/search-engine-manipulation-...</a>",1451287734

(The non-novel parts should become libraries, frameworks, services, etc.) Building novel things requires a lot of exploratory work. And exploratory work goes best when your cost of change is low, which means keeping your batch size as small as possible. Anything that forces you to know more means larger batch sizes and higher risks of failure.<p>Most of the improvements in software methods over the last 20 years are related to smaller batch sizes and easier exploration of a problem domain.

405920,comment,405814,405814,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"I would say agile is neither pure snake oil nor pure panacea. The fundamental idea of agile is to empower each programmer to start <i>doing something</i> without having to be held back by the complex dependencies of ""big up front design"".<p>Test Drive Development and typeless languages are at the heart of this. They let each programmer ""start in the middle"" so that the team is no longer working according to the situation where most of the team is hemmed in by the one guy working on the ""critical path"" and you no longer have to construct a whole, working system to see if your code works.<p>Now, the assumption of agile is that writing tests, refactoring and working at a constant, unhurried speed, a team is enough to allow the team to avoid ""technical debt"" - being hobbled by a design which the application has outgrown.<p>My experience, however, is that if Water Fall over-estimates the upfront design an application, agile underestimates it. It is quite possible to have serious design flaws in applications which have been developed via TDD. Architecture is a many-layered thing. For example, typeless languages are great for doing duck-type-based tests but they defining and reimplementing a documented interface hard. Typed languages are the opposite. Also, it is easy to write tests which assume a given architecture so that refactoring an architecture can thus suddenly becomes something everyone avoids - just the old situation where no one fixed structural bugs but instead worked around them.<p>Overall, there is no easy solution.",1229906853

And it took me a while to figure out what was going on. My new computer which i bought 2 month ago was thus brought to a crawl every time I started up.<p>3.

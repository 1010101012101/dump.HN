The same could be claimed of capitalism (or probably any other ..ism), see the banking sector and American healthcare for good examples.<p>In the rather socialist Denmark (where I happen to be from) when you break a leg you go to the doctor to get it fixed for free, and then you call your employer and tell him you won't be working for the next week, but you'll receive your paycheck nonetheless. When you get a child you take 9 months off work with full pay so that your offspring can get a good introduction to life. When you're out of a job the state will take care of you indefinitely.<p>Despite of this denmark has a consistently strong economy, is one of the richest countries in the world, and has for many years been in the top three of both the happiest country and the least corrupt country in the world.",1340459762

4150844,comment,4150053,4150730,4,0,polyfractal,,,"Well, there are both retrograde and anterograde tracers.  So you can trace from either target->source or source->target depending on your choice of tracer.<p>These tracers are used to map circuits because they are passed from one neuron to the next via functional synapses...which means that any neuron that is stained must have been in contact with a previous neuron, etc etc.<p>The ""connectome"" is built up by injecting a limited amount of tracer in a single region, in multiple animals, to provide a mapping of that region.  To get the entire brain you need lots and lots of injections in a very large number of mice (and a lot of technicians slaving away over cryostats).<p>To your point about not labeling synapses and gap junctions:  those are relatively unimportant when considering wiring diagrams of the brain.  What is more important is knowing which partners a neuron synapses onto.  You don't really care how many synapses are involved unless you are looking at single or clusters of neurons, nor can you really measure it without some other method (e.g. electrophysiology).<p>Caveat about tracers which often goes unannounced: the staining of a tracer in a secondary neuron is only as strong as the connection between the primary and the secondary.  Which means that a neuron who synapses strongly will be much brighter than a neuron that synapses weakly.  Similarly, tertiary (and quaternary, etc) neurons become progressively weaker stained as the exponential dilution of the tracer kicks in.",1340459585

At least that's how I remember it, so in that light, everything on your article is true but setuptool had to be ""rebooted"" as pip.<p>I think that pip + distribute intended to be a pragmatic approach you're calling for and that distutil2 is the cleanup/rewrite/redesign you said should happen after. Except it's not as clean cut as ""repair setuptools with as much hacks as necessary and then rewrite the implementation once all design decisions have been finalized"".<p>That said, you're completely right, use cases were forgotten and distutils2 might have started too soon.

The good parts are where he sticks to his core strength of anthropology -- it's filled with fascinating descriptions of how commerce and law worked in various societies, ancient and modern, from the Irish monks who sat down and figured out the precise compensation that you need to pay if one of your bee stings another man [the regular price of the sting minus the cost of the bee] to the spear/cloth bartering festival slash orgies of some Aboriginal tribe. Lots of fascinating stuff there.<p>He is on much shakier territory when he starts to enter into the economists' domain. He's probably correct when he declares that the inefficient pre-money ""barter economy"" has never actually existed, but then he breaks his arm patting himself on the back to say he's smarter than all the economists who always use this as an example when explaining why we have money.<p>When it comes time to actually try to explain debt itself, he's really lost. He starts the book by posing a question: how is it that the language of debt got so wound up in the language of morality; by extension, why do we think it's immoral to not pay our debts? He never seems to come around to the obvious answer: that a debt is a promise, a promise of money later in exchange for money now, and that breaking your promises is seen as immoral because it breaks the reciprocity that underlies almost all human interactions. He seems to have a mental image of ""debt"" as something that a loan shark puts you in so that he can break your legs afterwards, rather than the vast majority of the world's responsible debt arrangements which wind up beneficial to both parties.<p>Anyway, I'd say Graeber's ""Debt: The First 5000 Years"" has some interesting bits but a bunch of flaws.

I'm pretty sure the Ancient Greeks and Romans would find <i>that</i> repulsive.<p>Now, I'm a child of my time, so I think homosexuality is OK, and I think paedophilia is a crime. But were I a child of, say, the thirties or forties, where in my youth fascist regimes burned homosexuals by the thousands, what would I say? Would I have the empathy, or the courage to understand and express <i>against the strong sentiment of society</i> my understanding for the gay cause?<p>I also want to note that ""chemical castration"" is a harsh term, and I find the treatment to be an interesting, indeed even acceptable, alternative to just straight incarceration. In the face of a force society considers dangerous to itself, it is a good thing that we can use medication to combat it  and we still do when applicable, for example also with psychopaths and other severe mental illnesses. That homosexuality was viewed as dangerous to society back then is certainly sad, even terrible. But how will people fifty years hence look onto our debates about whether to allow people to marry? How will they look onto our treatment of socially <i>not</i> accepted sexual deviants. Social ousting, sex offenders list, incarceration, the eroding of free speech in the name of reducing just the <i>chances</i> of sexually ""deviant"" activity?<p>People back then did what they did because they thought it right. It is not <i>what</i> they did that we should find repulsive, because their methods are by and large the same we employ today when faced with similar value judgements. It is the <i>why</i>. Homosexuality is not a mental illness. We have finally learned this, and I hope it won't take more than the dying out of the current generation of politicians for society at large to accept this.<p>(I'm sorry to have drawn a parallel between homosexuality and paedophilia  I'm not meaning to suggest any similarity between the two on a biological or indeed conceptual level. I wanted to explain my view that the concept of homosexuality in the society of the 50s was indeed a similar one to the concept of paedophilia today.)",1340457208

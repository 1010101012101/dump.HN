However, one problem is when you study a subject and get a bit stuck (currently taking Pricing Options [2], and there are a few tricky parts so far). Ideally I would like to ask questions and based on the answers continue to ask questions until I understand. As it is now, it is pretty painful to try to use the forums, and maybe get an answer. In person (or live video) with a professor or TA would help a lot. But of course that doesn&#x27;t scale well.<p>Also, the fact that the completion rate for MOOCs is very low doesn&#x27;t mean much. It is free to sign up, so many (including me) sign up only to check out a course, or to just watch the lectures.<p>[1] <a href=""http://henrikwarne.com/2012/05/08/coursera-algorithms-course/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://henrikwarne.com/2012/05/08/coursera-algorithms-course...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.edx.org/course/v2/pricing-options-mathematical-models-caltechx-bem1105x"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.edx.org/course/v2/pricing-options-mathematical-m...</a>",1427806718

I work at a giant multinational and yes yes I know all about the stereotype that innovation only comes from the tiny little startups on HN, but innovation flows both ways, like it or not, and over the last decade one megacorp major cultural shift I&#x27;ve seen is collaboration only happens in email because its documented and highly accountable.  If you really want to share opinions or idea or requirements or demands in a verifiable documented backed up permanent fashion then you put it in email.  You don&#x27;t have a &quot;real&quot; opinion until its written down and sent in email.<p>If you just want to talk about sports or the weather or gossip about colleagues or lie to someones face about a due date or product change or a spec, you exclusively do that verbally on the phone or in a meeting or text.  Non email based collaboration is seen as a fake waste of time, because, lets face it, it is.  If you&#x27;re too much of a coward or crook to put your name to a statement, then its not worth reading.  If someone refuses to document what they&#x27;re saying in email or a bug ticket they are pretty much treated as liars or ignored.  Its an interesting cultural shift.  I have one older boss (yeah office space style I have a couple bosses, informally) who is all about the &quot;personal&quot; nature of a phone call or meeting, but its always super ineffective.  He&#x27;s still a nice guy and overall a good manager, but &quot;old people thinking&quot; is holding him back compared to the other mgmt who have moved on with the times.<p>It seems to work extremely well, especially with multi-office, multi-timezone, multi-national, multi-company teams. (edited to add, and this factors into the &quot;scalability&quot; mantra heard so often on HN... don&#x27;t set yourself up to fail, operate like a big company from the start)  And violating the &quot;new way&quot; by only communicating verbally or in meetings seems to dismally fail fairly often.<p>This large company innovation will probably spread to the smaller companies sooner or later.",1427806208

In a Daniel Day-Lewis <i>There Will Be Blood</i> voice, &quot;Aaaaagggge discrimination, Eli, you boy!&quot;<p>Companies use these horrible office layouts for a number of reasons, and not all are so distasteful: everyone else is doing it, they&#x27;re cheap, and they take good pictures for marketing because they &quot;look busy&quot;. But, when you get to the core of it and the leadership behind this open-plan fetishism, it&#x27;s all about age discrimination.<p>Life changes make people less able to handle the chronic visibility (especially from behind) that these offices inflict. For women, pregnancy will do the trick. Men tend to like open-plan offices less after having children as well, because when you have kids you no longer perceive the world as free of danger, due to having a biological imperative to protect another creature, and you stop believing in the &quot;nothing to hide&quot; bullshit that convinces people to accept such invasions into their privacy. But even in childless people, the ability to handle the needless stress inflicted by open-plan offices seems to decline around age 30.<p>There&#x27;s also a stress that comes from incoherent noise when it comes from all angles. This is something that scuba divers are aware of, because of the way water plays with sound. It can exacerbate the &quot;blue orb phenomenon&quot; that can cause an open-water freak-out (which sounds, presumably unintentionally, similar to an open-office panic attack).<p>This is especially bad for technology. The cruelty of software&#x27;s age discrimination is that it takes 10-20 years just to be good at this stuff. People are pressured to leave the industry long before their prime.<p>Oh, and there&#x27;s a 1 to 2 percent per year chance, even in healthy people, that you get a life-altering anxiety or panic disorder if you do knowledge work in an open-plan office. (They aren&#x27;t as bad for less cognitively intense tasks.) That doesn&#x27;t show up in the marketing materials, and the casualty rate is low enough that few people talk about it, but it&#x27;s a factor as well.",1427806025

Likewise for scale invariance. Translation invariance is already introduced by the convolution operation itself.<p>Just to be clear (and I&#x27;m sorry if I&#x27;m being pedantic), you&#x27;re talking about invariance of two separate things. In the first case, you&#x27;re talking about the invariance of the overall network, F(x), i.e. if R is a rotation operator, F(Rx) = F(x). The network&#x27;s prediction does not change for a suitable set of R&#x27;s.<p>On the other hand, convolution is a shift invariant <i>operator</i>, meaning it acts the same no matter its location. If Cx is the output of a convolutional layer and Sx is a shifted signal, then C(Sx) = S(Cx). This is not shift invariance of the output.<p>The shift invariance of the operator means the convolutional will detect features that resonate well with its kernel irrespective of the location of their location in the signal. However, this does not automatically guarantee that the network&#x27;s prediction will be shift invariant, i.e. F(Sx) = F(x).",1427805702

Which is useful, but I&#x27;m guessing doesn&#x27;t do a good job of capturing <i>structural</i> changes to the legal code. Is this fair?<p>So I&#x27;m curious: how do legal scholars and practising lawyers track changes to legal systems over time? Do they use trees, DAGs, or something else? Do they have concepts similar to change dependencies and regressions? What special concepts or techniques does the domain require?<p>The UK has legislation.gov.uk [1], which seems to treat acts of the UK parliament as some kind of structured objects. Amendments can be accessed, and there is a timeline feature (for example [2]) that shows changes over time. It does have the feeling of being incomplete, though, and lagging behind changes as they happen. So is there some other, canonical, data source that this site tracks? What is it?<p>Anyone knowledgeable care to comment?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legislation.gov.uk/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/39/section/21?timeline=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/39/section/21?timel...</a>",1427804025

It actually replaced PBRUSH.EXE and WRITE.EXE with dummy EXE:s that would just launch MSPAINT.EXE and WORDPAD.EXE instead. These dummy files are still in recent Windows versions for compatibility with stuff like ancient apps that create shortcuts to launch Write with their docs.<p>It was trivial to retrieve PBRUSH.EXE from Windows 3.1 install media, however, and it works fine on Windows 95 as well as every subsequent 32-bit Windows.",1427804017

And if you do fall, falling on your head only happens if you make a bad or unfortunate fall.<p>(I&#x27;ve had... about three serious bike accidents - fell on my head once (ow), broke my arm (ow), and drove into a rock I didn&#x27;t see, causing a cut on my arm (pain. And plenty of blood).<p>But, three accidents, of which only one would&#x27;ve warranted a helmet, none of which happened in the past 15 years, are not nearly enough reason for me to wear a helmet on my bicycle.

We were used to pedestrians giving way to us, unless there was a proper zebra style crossing, and even then that was somewhat voluntary.

In Amsterdam though, as you can see from the pictures, there&#x27;s simply not enough room for extra lanes (unless they get rid of the canals). There&#x27;s barely room for a sidewalk, and those are barely walkable because of the parked bicycles. There&#x27;s plenty of space (and space used) in North America, on the other hand - in fact the sprawl is the reason why people use cars all the time.<p>That&#x27;s also why businesses in Amsterdam have no problems with having bike lanes - they know that only very few cars are physically able to park in front of their store, and that their customers either generally live close by, or are tourists walking through town.<p>Re: Parking, yes it is available everywhere, but Amsterdam has one of the highest parking costs of any city in the Netherlands - also again to reduce the amount of cars in the city center and discourage their use.<p>Bike lanes don&#x27;t prevent crucial business deliveries because said trucks will just park on the bike lanes, street, or sidewalk - cyclists are agile, they can go around.",1427803486

10013188,comment,10012328,10012562,0,0,dbs,,,"Securities and exchanges professional here, although based in Europe (no affiliation with T0 or any related platform).<p>Settlement is the process by which securities are delivered against payment, from one counter-party to another (the seller delivers the securities, the buyer delivers the cash).<p>What happens today is that both clearing and settlement are necessary because the speed of trading is much faster than the cycle time for completing an underlying transaction (delivery versus payment), usually in T+2 or T+3 days.<p>At the middle is the CSD - Central Securities Counterparty - that intermediates the delivery versus payment transactions and guarantees that when shit hits the fan (when one of the parties fails to deliver) the money is on the table for the other.<p>Settlement is costly: the CSD charges both parties for this &quot;matching & insurance&quot; service; sometimes the settlement operation represents the largest share of the costs involved in a transaction (trading + clearing + settlement; and after that you have also custody costs).<p>And usually settlement is only available for very liquid, exchange traded securities. Because the CSD my have to put money on the table they can do it only in securities they know they can get their money back. If you are a broker and there is no CSD you have to trust in the counterparties you deal with to minimize fail-to-deliver risk. Which brings a lot of inefficiency to these markets.<p>With smart contracts, if &quot;the trade is the settlement&quot; (which is a very neat way of expressing it!) it seems you no longer need to use traditional settlement services. The trade only occurs when you deliver the securities. And you have no limitation in the number of securities you can trade. Less costs, less time to deliver, same level of risks as in with a CSD.(EDIT: broader, unfulfilled markets). Seems like a wining proposition to me.",1438811964

(Thread memory use is kind of independent of 1:1 vs. M:N, honestly; the thing that <i>can</i> improve scalability is relocatable stacks, which is really not the same thing.)<p>It&#x27;s instructive to look at the history of M:N versus 1:1 in the days of NPTL and LinuxThreads and compare that to the history of programming languages. In that world it was received wisdom that M:N would be superior for the reasons always cited today, but at the end of the day 1:1 was found to be better in practice, because the Linux kernel is pretty darn good at scheduling and pretty darn fast at syscalls. Nobody advocates M:N anymore in the Linux world; it&#x27;s universally agreed to be a dead end. Now, to be fair to Golang, relocatable stacks <i>do</i> change the equation somewhat, but (a) as argued above, I think that&#x27;s really independent of 1:1 vs. M:N; (b) any sort of userspace threading won&#x27;t get you to the performance of, say, nginx, as once you have any sort of stack per &quot;thread&quot; you&#x27;ve already lost.",1438811501

The most basic &quot;smart contract&quot; is a Bitcoin payment, the contract says &quot;pay this to anyone who can produce a signature corresponding to the public key I have hashed in this contract&quot;[1].<p>The less used smart contract involving cryptography can be &quot;pay this amount to anyone who can find any sha256 collision&quot;[2], or &quot;flip a trustless N-sided coin and pay someone based on the outcome&quot;[3], or in the future we could play more complex games and trustlessly pay the winner as long as we can create a trustless proof that the winner is in fact the winner.<p>There are also possible smart contracts that may allow individuals to move their money to another system, be they trustless like a sidechain or lightning hub, or trusty like Open Transactions, which has federated trust between a set of individuals.<p>Another form of trusty transaction is multisig escrow, where you can have individuals vote on who gets the money. Unlike giving an intermediary money they can run off with, you give an intermediary or set of intermediaries a vote on where the money ends up[4]. With multisig combined with nlocktime you can have money spendable by you if you verify your identity (usually through email) to an authority. If the authority refuses to let you spend, then you can get your funds back when your nlocktime transaction expires. They cannot spend your money though[5].<p>In short, when you have programmable money you can create a smart contract that allows funds to be redeemed by getting information from trusted external sources or internal trustless cryptography.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Standard_Transaction_to_Bitcoin_address_.28pay-to-pubkey-hash.29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Standard_Transaction_to_Bi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2013-September/005301.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2013-Septe...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3698v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3698v1.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contract#Trust_minimization:_multiple_independent_oracles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contract#Trust_minimization:_mult...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/GreenAddress"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/GreenAddress</a>",1438809647

I too don&#x27;t like that Arkadium (developers given the license from Microsoft) have been allowed to make them increasingly naggy Adware/Freemium, but sadly that is a lot more to do with the current state of the videogame industry than the current state of Windows.<p>Solitaire was removed because they wanted universal apps and someone else (Arkadium) to foot the bill for development. Given that Solitaire was a hobby project thrown in for free, it&#x27;s kind of amazing it was distributed in as many versions of Windows as it was (and that it survived for so long with very little needed in maintenance/bug fixes). Enterprises kept asking for it not to be included in Windows, and now it is not and an enterprise has easy ways to stop people from installing it now... Consumers &quot;win&quot; in that it&#x27;s now a product from an actual game company with actual monetization goals in a culture that has allowed ad-ware and freemium to become atrociously obnoxious...

In this metric, a chip 90% as fast as state of the art might be 1/10 the cost to develop by then. Or even less.<p>But even if Intel isn&#x27;t seeing much progress in terms of single core performance, they&#x27;re beating the crap out of AMD in terms of performance per watt, and by extension, absolute performance of the high end multi core parts.<p>Taking a look at the absolute insanity that are the 18 core Haswell-EP parts, and comparing them to the 8 module Piledriver parts, and the die size of each (i.e. the cost to make them), the gap is widening, not shrinking.<p>I think everyone here has known for a while that the free lunch is over with respect to writing single core programs and speeding up their execution on future hardware. That&#x27;s going to take a while to filter down to building programs that take advantage of large amounts of parallelism, but it&#x27;s going to happen. And when it does, consumer CPUs are going to look more like server parts.<p>With the programs of today, you&#x27;d rather a 4.0ghz quad core.

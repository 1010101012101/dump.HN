Sure, training people in Latex will eventually make them churn out better looking documents than Word, but the initial training costs and learning curve are going to be really high for the average office worker for who Word with the ribbon is overkill.<p>I am all for being against conventional wisdom, but surely someone would have done some experiments on these lines to unlock the creative expression of their employees? There are even a bunch of companies who allow and provide facilities for napping since they believe it helps be more productive. What's stopping them from switching to CLIs exclusively?<p>Also, he ignores the power of macros(VBScript is very powerful) and keyboard shortcuts in GUIs. Watch an occasional user of Office vs. a pro user and you can see the difference clearly. How many here can profess to know about <i>every</i> feature or shortcut in Word or Excel?

You only hit a wall in the most simplest of applications(same as CLI), for complicated applications, there's a ton of room to explore.<p>It makes more sense to rant against programs/devices(browsers, pdf readers, watching movies) that encourage consumption versus the programs/devices that encourage creation(photoshop, IDEs, writing HTML in notepad). That's the only way the analogy of driving a car vs. playing a guitar makes any sense.<p>I can't fathom why the author is trying to turn that argument into a CLI vs. GUI argument that superficially sounds plausible but just falls apart with a little scrutiny.<p>Since the author has mastered the car UI, I am looking forward for him to execute this move <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CK94zCXsKI&feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CK94zCXsKI&feature=relat...</a>",1319554773

3154271,comment,3153828,3153828,4,0,Cushman,,,"Not to overstretch the metaphor, but it's not that black and white. Something as simple-seeming as manual shifting on your car can change your experience of driving completely, making you much more aware and attentive of what's really going on between your ass and the road. It makes you a real part of the vehicle's decision making process. (The description I like is ""It's like having a conversation with your car."")<p>And that from what seems like a trivial change, just a single extra degree of freedom; one that most find just an annoyance. To bring it back around, it's possible to bridge the gap, providing a powerful <i>and</i> easy-to-use interface. But it will probably mean a lot of your users asking rightly, ""But couldn't you just do that for me?""<p>The appropriate answer is something like, ""Yeah. I could also just go to the store and get your groceries for you, and you'd never have to leave the house. Do you want to be cargo, or do you want to <i>drive</i>?""",1319554741

3154263,comment,3153828,3153956,1,0,vidarh,,,"I think part of the resistance you'd meet to labeling piano keys is that you're highly unlikely to be able to play well if you depend on looking at the keys, as it slows you down too much to be able to play anything but the slowest pieces, whereas you can write well (though arguably not type well) on a keyboard while still looking at the keys.<p>As a teaching tool, labeling can work for both, but as a crutch for people who are less than proficient, labeling does not work well for someone trying to play the piano. There's a greater need for getting to a certain level of proficiency if you wish to play the piano than if you wish to use a keyboard.",1319554503

Switching languages just because there are pain points is not a solution, because you'll simply be exchanging one problem for another.<p>""or modify the front-end of your compiler""<p>This is most definitely pie-in-the-sky. In the real world of real business, you can't do this.<p>""I mean it, the cost of boilerplate is really high.""<p>Oh, I agree wholeheartedly. But you need to work in the languages that programmers understand today. I'm not going to have nearly as much success hiring smalltalk programmers as I would have hiring Python programmers, for example.<p>""Unrolling loops: I never saw an instance where that was necessary.""<p>I have, but then again I've been at this for 20 years.<p>""Plus, the compiler can often do it for you.""<p>You can't be sure until you look at the disassembly. Often, it does it wrong.<p>""Switch statement: the syntax of the construct is heavy, we should lighten it.""<p>That's not going to happen within the next decade. Meanwhile cut & paste is my tool of choice to cut through the boilerplate.<p>""Goto: your example shows exceptions (trycatch finally here). Goto makes much less sense when you have them.""<p>But it makes LOTS of sense when you don't have them. And it's still useful in C++ and Objective-C, where you still end up interfacing with C libraries. If you don't know about the goto ""poor man's exception"", you'll either end up with repeated and buggy deallocation code, or a monstrosity of nested scopes, or a bunch of check-return-and-throw constructs, which in the case of Objective-C will slow your program way down because it implements try/catch using longjmp.<p>Goto is also useful for breaking out of inner loops when the language doesn't support that (some languages support ""break [label], to make it seem less like a goto).<p>I don't consider these to be last resorts; I consider them specialized tools. Much like design patterns, they're for mitigating some deficiencies in a programming language, but they're only effective if you know how to use them.",1319554001

3154218,comment,3151233,3151780,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I disagree, here's why:<p>First, the software engineering field is still very immature. The tools and terminology in use are still very primitive. Studies seeking to identify best practices via evidence are still few and far between. Worse yet, known best practices with substantial evidence behind them are widely ignored in the industry on average. I believe there is still a lot of room for new techniques, and new models of software engineering, which will serve to guide developers for generations.<p>Second, we are at a critical juncture in programming languages. There are a lot of new languages gaining popularity, and a lot of older languages seeing substantial change. The fundamental paradigms in use by the average programmer are changing (becoming increasingly more functional, generally). Meanwhile, there are even more advanced concepts on the horizon (monads, for example) which are still not accessible to most programmers. There's a huge opportunity there for the next generation of languages to increase the accessibility of those advanced techniques. Additionally, we're in the midst of a revolution in terms of compiler technology. We are seeing things like modular compilers, very advanced run-times capable of incredible speed improvements, cutting edge garbage collectors, and the potential for massive parallelization on the desktop. Again, there's a huge potential there for some very fundamental innovations.<p>Third, we are no where near the end of the line in computing hardware. Over the next few decades we could see some very crazy things. 3D micro-chips putting trillions of transistors into every cpu. Even more massive parallelization than what we've seen today. RSFQ processors that could put petaflops computing power on a single chip. MRAM married to processor cores leading to breakthroughs in performance. Non-Von Neumann architectures enabled by memory and processing power being mixed together. FPGAs with billions of gates with the capability to operate and reconfigure at multi-gigahertz speed.

But none of them pretend to be produced by hand in Gmail.<p>Sending personal emails to the first 1,000 customers is great, and switching to automated lead nurturing after that is great.

But also because customers don't think it's appropriate to get a personal email once you grow to a certain size.<p>Anecdote: I've been heavily involved in our sales process at Zencoder since the beginning (as CEO), including writing personal emails to 500-1000 signups early on. (We've stopped that by now, but it was the right thing to do early on.) A few months ago, our sales director and I went to meet with a high-value prospect. At that point, their financial value wasn't huge (hundreds per month), but we knew they would grow, and that they'd be a good reference customer. So we pitched them and everything went well.<p>I ended up meeting with them a second time, and they asked me point-blank: ""How is your business viable, if we're only paying you $X00/month?""<p>The subtext was this: ""If we're only paying you $X00/month, and we get the CEO in for two in-person meetings, then you must be small, and we must be a critical customer for you to win."" Customers should feel important, but never critical.<p>This came to a head when we sent them a final proposal. They asked for a price break and concessions, and said explicitly that because they were an important customer for us, we'd give them these things concessions. In reality, they were no more important than 20 other prospects we were working with.

I'm afraid I gave the book to my brother after I read it, so I can't give you an authoritative summary of the arguments in the book. As best as I can recall, the argument was renewables generally have such low power density (W/m^2) and high energy cost ($/J) that they are unlikely to be an effective solution to climate change, should climate change be as severe as we fear it might be. (Ridley is not a climate change denier, but he does think scientists' worst fears are exaggerated.<p>Here's an audio interview with Ridley that might cover some of the same stuff in the book: <a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2010/10/ridley_on_trade.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2010/10/ridley_on_trade.htm...</a>",1319551643

Historically I've been rather reluctant to do this since I can learn on my own, and have. However, I think the structure and the environment provided by school is worth the 25k a total cost. Having money on the barrel head provides a real sense of focus. Having a peer group that wants to really pursue the same topic is valuable and worth a portion of the 25k. Finally, it gets me to focus on a topic. Currently I'm flitting around from technology to technology, fueled by HN. I look at Node.js, then Mongo, then a plethora of JS libraries.

Loading a single byte should still be fast (in the absolute worst case, it's a single shift and a mask on top of the cost of loading 4 or 8 bytes) and using less memory means it's much more likely for the table to remain in cache (and evict less other stuff). In fact, I'd go so far as to wager that a uint8_t[16] (or uint64_t[4] or whatever) with one bit per character, manually extracted, would be the fastest way to do it.

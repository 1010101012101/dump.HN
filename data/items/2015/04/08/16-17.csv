I detested dealing with the package manager.<p>I wrote so much stuff to get around apt when dealing with software packages. I wrote a Maven-based update system (with user-friendly wrappers) for pulling down updates on customer units, and my boss wrote an SVN-based solution for internal dev work. I wrote our own validation system to determine if a package can be safely installed, and if it passed, it&#x27;d get shoved in with dpkg -i --force-all, because I didn&#x27;t trust dpkg to do it itself. I wrote a meta-package system (basically a tarball of debs + a manifest file) so I could guarantee atomic installation (read the manifest, verify every deb in the metapackage, and abort before installing anything if even a single package fails verification).<p>> pacman also has far less switches, at least I know only of -Q -Qs -S -Ss -Sy -U and -Ql | grep for something Im looking for.

The imbalance of trade between Germany and other Eurozone partners does indeed create winners and looser. How different is this from states within the US. Since when did the US care about similar imbalances created between Alabama and say California? I&#x27;m sure there are arguments against this comparison. I&#x27;d be interested to hear them.<p>That aside, I &quot;feel&quot; (based on living in Germany) that Bernanke is correct with his suggestions of where Germany could move. I don&#x27;t think it will have much impact on the trade deficit but it will help Germany avoid more drastic emergencies in the future. The pay for workers is out of balance. The investment in infrastructure is not required now but important for its future. Currently it&#x27;s infrastructure is far better off than other EU zone countries of similar size (and many times better than the US). But if it wants to retain it&#x27;s significance 20 years from now it will need to innovate in infrastructure or be satisfied with being that country known for making old-world things at good quality. Germany definitely needs policies that encourage investment. Ideally though I&#x27;d prefer that not be in housing as stable housing is probably one of the primary social benefits in Germany. But as it stands with its undervalued assets it&#x27;s becoming a place to be bought by others. Politically this creates interdependence which is NOT a bad thing but ultimately as the undervaluing continues Germans are just throwing away that value as value lost. In a globalized economy if they do not capitalize on it someone else will. Still, none of this will do much for the trade deficit. Because while it may take 20 years for Germany to push some of these changes, change within other EU countries to take advantage of it will take significantly longer.

I&#x27;m not the kind of person who will come up with a project idea and build an app from nothing. That&#x27;s not me.

I&#x27;m the grunt whose hard work in the background enables the superstars to go out and do their thing. And I&#x27;ve found that I _enjoy_ that. It gives me a lot of personal pleasure to help and support people, especially people who I feel deserve my support. I&#x27;ve realized that I&#x27;d be much happier being the kingmaker than being the king. I guess this is why I&#x27;m more drawn to systems programming: it&#x27;s behind-the-scenes supporting work, suitable for a behind-the-scenes supporting person.<p>I could also get into Myers-Briggs typology here.

Swipe-to-scroll is so natural, particularly at this point, that moving back to an indirect method of scrolling seems just <i>wrong</i>.  And doing so on a device that&#x27;s already touch, and already using swipe-to-scroll, feels twice and wrong and unnecessarily confusing.<p>I understand the intent and the goal, but the inconsistent use of the crown -- if it&#x27;s so great, why can I still swipe to scroll at all? -- is a tell.  It would have been better to simply detect swipe-to-scroll along the right edge of the bezel (if not along the right side of the frame itself) to effect &quot;scrolling without obscuring&quot;.<p>Four-ways-to-click (crown-click vs tap vs force tap vs tap-and-hold) is an eyebrow-raise-er all its own.<p>Also: displays should be wider.

That does not look like fortitude to me.  It looks like walking your very first tightrope, never having had the benefit of even seeing another person cross one, over a pit of starving grizzly bears, as the people who have already crossed laugh at you and throw rocks at your head.<p>Those who already fell into the pit and managed to climb back out for another try have fortitude.

Perhaps they simply have an aversion to being chased down and eaten by ravenous bears.

If we accept that not everyone can do every type of job, that IQ does separate people in their abilities to do or even learn to do a job, etc. then that means we will see mass displacement of the workforce when the only jobs available to many are one&#x27;s that are out of their educational or intellectual reach.<p>This is just the beginning, by the way, as AI and automation gets better then the skills and jobs it can replace will grow and increasingly sap up jobs requiring higher levels of intellect or education. So while low-skilled job replacement is the primary short-term challenge, overall job replacement is a medium-longer term challenge.<p>This challenge has been on my mind quite a lot recently, as have the challenges posed by the development of AGI/AI which are pretty well linked, although AGI has its own challenges in terms of what it might mean for humanity as a whole.<p>If we accept the above then we accept that not just large scale unemployment, but large scale human redundancy, is inevitable then we have very large questions to ask, and thus very large answers or solutions to provide, regarding how we structure society.<p>If the low skilled jobs are the first to go, which are tended to by people of lower IQ / intellect or who aren&#x27;t strong academically, then not only will we have large scale unemployment/human redundancy but I believe it would be coupled with comparatively low entrepreneurship. That&#x27;s not to say that people of lower intellect can&#x27;t be entrepreneurs, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find easy problems to solve and will only become more so. It would also be significantly more difficult for such people to, for example, open a franchise of a chain due to the financial and experience backgrounds levied by most franchise owners.<p>The conclusion I&#x27;ve come to is that socialism is inevitable in the medium-long term whereby the machines do the work and the ownership/profits of the methods of production are shared by everyone.<p>I&#x27;m not a proponent of socialism, I will say, but I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s inevitable given the technologies and changes that are coming our way.<p>On solutions:<p>- Without changing the ownership of that which produces, a basic living income for all would come at a very high cost to those who still have jobs in the form of higher taxes.<p>- If the current situation remains, whereby few people control the vast bulk of the production in the economy, and large scale unemployment comes around, even with a basic living income we will see unparalleled inequality. Even if ALL jobs were replaced by machines, if the ownership of these machines and the decisions regarding their profit remains in the hands of few, there will not only be unparalleled inequality but a system of inequality more sustainable than ever before.<p>- Regardless of how a solution is implemented, it will be gradual as automation takes time to take up increasingly more intelligent work, which will place an enormous burden on those intelligent enough to do the work. It will inherently become even more less unequal, as those who &quot;cannot&quot; do the work will not work but would be supported by those who can, those who can will do so and pay large taxes while doing so, and those who own that which produces can further relax.<p>- We live in a society that is increasingly &quot;no man left behind&quot; in terms of resources. The obvious solution to an issue whereby society shifts toward more intelligent work and automation of less skilled work would be to produce more intelligent babies.<p>-- Eugenics will never be looked upon kindly, so the only other solution is to make embryonic selection for intelligence en vogue.<p>-- Despite grand increases in intelligence and knowledge, many of the population are still highly religious. I don&#x27;t believe this will fare well for embryonic selection in the short term.<p>-- Therefore in the short term we would see more of what we currently see - higher reproduction rates in the unemployed or those doing low skilled work, increasingly lower rates amongst those in higher skilled work as having a child becomes even more expensive/stressful due to higher taxes.<p>-- This makes all the above challenges even more difficult than they already are.<p>So the solution lies in something like:<p>- Changing the ownership of production<p>- Putting in place support systems to support the lives of those whose jobs are replaced and who have not the skills or intelligence to take higher skilled work<p>- Putting in place support systems to enable those in higher skilled work/higher education/etc. to have as many children as they want. Free childcare for working parents is one of the most important parts of that.<p>- Increasing emphasis on education for all.

Critically, basic necessities are part of this economy, so food, water, shelter etc... are traded in the same markets as t-shirts, toys and printer paper.<p>What basic income proposes at it&#x27;s root is attempting to decouple basic necessities from the larger market economy. The mechanism that this works through attempts to retain the structure of the &quot;market economy&quot; and in general terms would set the basic wage at the market basket rate for necessities. Previous experiments on this have been either limited in duration or scope and would be argued could not be extrapolated to an entire national or world economy.<p>I think however that fundamentally we will need to change our moral attitudes broadly to actually embrace the &quot;post scarcity&quot; world.

Normally your team wouldn&#x27;t work contracts like this, but you thought it would be a good challenge and a way to test your skills. You had to work late nights for a few days, but you managed to get the site done in time and on budget. Sounds pretty nice, it&#x27;s good that you were selfless and spent some of your personal time to help the client on such a tricky project.<p>What actually happened was you just sat there browsing reddit until the deadline had almost arrived, then worked like crazy trying to get the site finished. Normally your team wouldn&#x27;t work contracts like that (which means normally your team would do their job properly). And it was a challenge and a test of your skills, because normally you don&#x27;t do jack squat at work. In fact, the reason you&#x27;re looking for a new job is because if you don&#x27;t quit your current employer will fire you.<p>Now you have a great story to tell an interviewer about how you completely fail to do your job properly. But by dressing up the words a little bit and using some creative euphemisms, you can make it sound like you went above and beyond. And it&#x27;s not really a lie, because you did go above and beyond... eventually. You just didn&#x27;t have to do that if you had worked properly. All you have to do is leave out the fact that you&#x27;re a massive slacker.<p>So you get the job because you told an awesome story of how devoted you are, and all you had to do was leave out one single fact (that the deadline was only tight because you procrastinated). Meanwhile your really awesome coworker tells every single fact 100% true and you get the job instead of him, because your story sounds better.",1428509157

In Postgres for example:<p>* A - you have the ability to not use transactions (technically it still implicitly uses transactions per statement, but that&#x27;s kind of expected behavior of the NoSQL databases).<p>* C - simply don&#x27;t use rules such as constraints, triggers etc.<p>* I - reduce isolation level of the transaction. Postgres due to its design doesn&#x27;t allow you to have dirty reads (ability to read from concurrent uncommitted transaction)<p>* D - there are several settings (e.g. disable sync, wal etc, create an unlogged table) which increase performance at the cost of potentially losing your data. You will also reduce it when you use asynchronous replication.<p>The ACID is a feature that is generally desired when your data is important to you and you also want to be certain that the data is always consistent at any point in time. It&#x27;s quite hard to implement it right, so it should not be treated like a bug.<p>Generally you should think of RDBMS as general purpose databases that have strong consistency guarantees, and the NoSQL as a specialized databases which no longer provide ACID guarantees in order to tackle specific domain.<p>There are also NoSQL databases which try to be general purpose, such as MongoDB. Those are joke. MongoDB for example currently not only is much slower than Postgres[1] it also doesn&#x27;t horizontally scale[2] on top of that you don&#x27;t even have ACID guarantees so you&#x27;re getting the worst out of both worlds.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-plus-edb-blog/marc-linster/postgres-outperforms-mongodb-and-ushers-new-developer-reality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-plus-edb-blog/marc-lins...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/WP-Benchmarking-Top-NoSQL-Databases.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/WP-Bench...</a>",1428509117

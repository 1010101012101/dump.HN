It took 2 professional dev/designers working on it for about a week (came together in a day, then spent a few days tweaking it to run faster and work on lots of screen sizes and devices).

Word order doesn't matter as slashcom says.<p>For example, if you take the score from the Oracle Pricing blurb posted by BitMistro, and change 'strategies' to 'goals', you drop down to 0.8 or so. If you add an extra random 'strategy' somewhere, it bumps up to 1.4 or something.<p>I actually suspect a bug on their pair for strategies... probably a decimal error when building to BS level tables.<p>But similar things happen with other 'bullshity' words, just to a lesser degree.",1346335158

Extra information for not-yet-crypto-nerds:<p>The ""modes"" i'm referring to are cipher block modes. Cipher block modes allow repeated application of a block cipher to long messages (because a block cipher's input must be a fixed length - that's what makes it a ""block"" cipher rather than a ""stream"" cipher).<p>Using a block cipher only gives you confidentiality; it does not verify the inegrity or the source of the message. For those, a message authentication code (MAC) is needed. There are several MAC algorithms.<p>There are some block cipher modes (including GCM) that provide both authentication and encryption because they include a MAC algorithm.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code</a>",1346334313

A sufficient number of bad programmers seem to fall in these trap often enough that the result is a mess.<p>Design pattern: I wouldn't be surprised if they <i>are</i> used too much.<p>Love towards getters/setters.  Not the fault of the language, that's just bad practice.  And no, you don't have encapsulation.  Rarely, getters and setters do some verifications or filtering, but most of the time they don't, in which case you just have raw access to the object's mutable state.  Be honest and make your variable public,  that's less code.  If you ever need to put checks or filters (almost never), then just refactor.<p>Long names: my jury is out for this one.  In your example, I'd say the overly long name comes from an overly narrow functionality.  For something that specific, you should use a description string.<p>Try/Catch: If your QA section tells you to check all exceptions, you may have quite a bit of those statements. (Also, maybe he included the body of the try/catch statements?)<p>Code that requires an advanced IDE to approach: a good IDE let you manage and tolerate higher levels of complexity.  You'll also be less encouraged to simplify your code.  You may not even notice when it becomes too complex for a humble vi user.<p>Verbose code: People tend to stop as soon as it works, without simplify their code further.  It's not the language's fault, nor is it done on purpose.  I hate when I see code like that.

It seems like the authors made some unfortunate choices in the configuration and usage of VoltDB.<p>A limited number of synchronous loads are always going to present scalability problems and will do a poor job measureing the throughput achievable. Even if it takes 500usecs to round-trip a transaction from the client, that means each synchronous client can only do 2000 per second. To scale linearly to 12 nodes might require hundreds of these synchronous clients.<p>VoltDB is commonly used with many parallel synchronous clients, such as web front-ends, or asynchronous workloads, such as event feeds. Both of these workload scale very well, so long as there is enough parallelism.<p>They also used global, consistent, multi-partition transactions for the YCSB scan. I'm not sure if that is necessary, and it would also limit scalability.<p>I can't speak too directly to the work because the code and configuration doesn't seem to be public. Perhaps I'm mistaken.<p>It would have been nice if they had reached out to us at VoltDB to verify their configuration and client. They also could have contacted Andy Pavlo at the H-Store who has some experience with YCSB on H-Store.<p>Still, we can always learn from something like this. One thing we're working on in VoltDB is better performance for workloads that aren't designed to be parallel. This means more performance for synchronous clients and for clients that do global consistent reads. Another area we could improve is more prominent diagnostics to show you why your cluster isn't running faster. That information is all available in our system tables and management tools, but we could probably boil it down to a single status field telling you whether your cluster is starved on client requests, intercluster-transaction-agreement or slow procedures. In our experience, it's usually the first one. I'll go file a ticket now.",1346332496

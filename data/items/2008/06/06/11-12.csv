Do GW people as a rule compare AGW people with creationists? And even if they would, what bearing would it have on the debate?<p>I have found McIntyre's blog, he seems to be a busy individual. At the moment he is discussing something about prehistoric buckets. That might be too much detail for my entry level... Also, I wonder what he would dig up if he spent the same energy on finding evidence FOR global warming.<p>Didn't find suitable articles at the Cramer link. Anyway, I will do my own searching.",1212753533

At some point, the company will have to grab that nettle firmly, and it’s not going to get any easier — if anything, it’s only going to get harder.""<p>I don't think Microsoft CAN catch up.",1212753484

I also find it silly that everyone jumps in and claims this and that about twitter. If there's a lesson to be learned here it's that PR and spin control is equally as important as your engineers.",1212753378
210758,comment,210714,210714,0,0,goodkarma,,,"Seems like a lose-lose situation for Twitter.  Before they just had errors saying ""oops, try again"".. but they had so much downtime that people wanted more transparency.  Now they have errors that say ""we lost a database"" and people are saying that's too much information. (I probably would not have made that an error message, but that's just me.)<p>I think Twitter should stop caring what everyone (especially TechCrunch) thinks and just fix the technical issues. And please fix it soon, because users are getting tired of the same problems!",1212753271

But if the 3G was intended to be obsolete less than a year after I bought it, it was a dick move to sell it with a 2 year contract. I don't think it's too much to ask that a phone not be obsolete before the contract runs out.<p>But I have learned my lesson. I'm only buying top-of-the-line from now on. I need to switch to Verizon because I moved to an area where they have the only decent network, and I'm holding out for the Rezound or Nexus Prime (Nov 10th).<p>But this also favors Android over the iPhone. New iPhones only come out every so often. Suppose your iPhone broke/got lost/got stolen at a time when the current iPhone is 8 months into its lifecycle. Your choices are to sign a 2 year contract for a phone that will be likely be obsolete before the contract runs out, pay an exorbitant cash price, go without a phone until the next release, or buy a cheap phone with no contract and wait for the next release. Or you could buy Android. There's always a latest and greatest Android phone that's not more than a month or so old.",1319720184

When you're outside the 5% margin at the end of the year, are you going to say, ""Oh, I screwed up"" or ""It was that 3.5% tax increase!""  I know which you'll pick.<p>Rich people generally don't get rich by throwing money away.  They aren't going to vote for higher taxes because that takes money directly from their pockets.<p>And if those taxes get passed, they'll find a way around them, like moving to another country, or at least moving their operations there.  It's already happening, and we don't need to make it any worse.<p>I'm not 'defending the rich', I'm defending our country.  I don't want to see the 1% leave.  It will not be pretty.<p>I'm not even close to being in the 1%, but I live comfortably.  I actually rather resent being included in their 99% statistic.  I haven't been tricked into owing a bank more than I earn in a year.  I haven't had a problem finding a job because I picked a career (and skillset) with a future.  Anyone that doesn't pick a skill and work towards it, then complains that there are no skill-less jobs left...  Well, I'm having trouble having sympathy.

The Katrina gun confiscations, some caught on video, also had an impact.  For that matter, as more and more excesses of the police get caught on video ... you'll note that in the US Google got a lot of takedown requires for those and refused ... well, those don't make people feel more secure.<p>Take your pick of the Great Recession and/or the election of Obama, who's history <i>prior</i> to 2008 was relentlessly anti-gun except for HR 5441 in 2007, that both outlawed Katrina style confiscations and critically provided a private right of action against those violating it.  Non-hunting gun and ammo sales went way up <i>and are still higher than before then</i>, even after we've seen that Obama in action is no more anti-gun than George W. Bush.  (Note that ""W"", like Obama, was in favor of a renewal of the ""assault weapons"" ban, which lapsed while he was in office, and again, no blood in the streets.)<p>The fact that despite these hard times people are still, 3 years later, buying more guns and ammo is pretty amazing.<p>I'll close with two factoids:<p>The last time I checked we buy 9 <i>billion</i> rounds of ammo per year.<p>Economically, the shooting sports are bigger than golf.",1319719750
3162760,comment,3162415,3162415,4,0,jonnathanson,,,"Perhaps the biggest lesson here: never give someone a gut-level estimate of <i>anything</i>. The challenge is that a lot of clients/bosses/whatever will press you for one. Some people just need to hear a spot-estimate in order to feel comfortable.<p>In those cases, I've found a fairly effective verbal counter. It goes something like this: ""Listen, Bob [assuming the client's name is Bob]. I don't want to mislead you here. I'd rather work up a proper estimate than throw out some number on the spot that might be incorrect. I want to do this the right way, for your benefit and mine.""<p>If Bob presses you further, respond with ""I've worked on similar projects in the past. Some have taken 2 days, and some have taken 10 days. It really depends on X, Y, and Z. I want to take a proper accounting of X, Y, and Z in this case, so that I'm not misleading you up front.""<p>If pressed further: ""Bob, obviously time is of the essence for you and for this project. I understand that, and I will do everything I can to ensure that I complete the project as quickly as possible. In the end, this will be much quicker if we get it right the first time. Give me a little bit of time to do some planning, and it'll save us a lot of time in the long run.""<p>All of this is true, of course. It's better to aim twice and shoot once, as the saying goes. However, there will be clients or bosses who just won't accept this sort of conversation up front. It'll piss them off. So be it. FAR better to have a little bit of confrontation at the outset than a lot of confrontation later on (i.e., if you toss out a gut estimate and then have to crawl back and amend or delay it).",1319719742

The goal is to see what you would actually do or believe, not to get your opinion why the situation would never happen or why the situation is Forbidden. I agree with you completely on the notion that killing people is wrong, I find it sick how he was killed and how his body was treated, however I recognize that, in the following toy scenario, killing is the optimal choice from the set of available choices {kill, do nothing}: an Oracle reveals to you that if you don't kill Mr. Bob within the next five minutes, 5 billion people are going to die; do you kill him?<p>Even Gandhi recognized the right outcome here, but I agree with him that in most real cases the set of choices usually contains something else, such as maiming or more generally ""disabling"" to include relatively harmless things like tackling. (Hence I still criticize soldiers who shoot-to-kill brainwashed and/or insane kids coming at them with a machete for not shooting them in the knees or somewhere easier to hit but less likely to kill.)<p>My original question is dependent on you believing that there exists some real situation where killing one or more people makes the world better, the classic (sorry to Godwin the topic) being to kill Hitler to save who knows how many lives (regardless of if the war still happened). Since you've said you don't believe that, I guess I got what I really wanted to know. I should have just framed it that way to begin with.

Not only does that include testing, that includes coding as well. That's right, startups avoid even writing bad code, much less good or great code. Every little thing you do has to be tested first -- and the only test that matters is ""do people want this?"" Not some kind of unit or mock test.<p>It's a totally different situation from corporate or normal small team programming where you already know somebody is paying you, you're only supposed to make them happy. Bob gets away with this because his market is those guys, the guys that are 95% of the market for his books and such. But since this is HN, I have to point out the differences between those guys and the average startup team. In the startup world <i>most of the time you don't even get paid</i>. Which means that all these discussions about languages, testing, craftsmanship, and the rest of it? It's just bullshit for some other folks. The guys who get a steady paycheck. If 19 times out of 20 the code you write for a startup will never be seen again, much less maintained, <i>there is no maintenance programmer</i>. There is no project. There is no customer. ""Craftmanship"" or ""Quality"" have no meaning. There may be some guy making 12-legged chairs from jello somewhere in the world, but no matter how great he is at doing that, and no matter what a wonderful job and hard work he puts into the product, he's not a craftsman. He's just some guy with mild Aspergers who is spending too much time with jello.<p>I think we do a great disservice when we talk about programming as something that can exist in a vacuum. It does not. Each programming team exists inside a certain economic reality, and that reality needs to be considered with each decision that is made. There is no universal standard of craftsmanship for programming because programming is a form of thinking, and there is no universal standard for that, either. To defend Uncle Robert, you <i>can</i> make broad generalizations, and for most business programmers I'm there with him, but it's important to know where the limits are to these things. Bob has a tendency to speak in overly broad generalizations.<p></rant>",1319719411

Back in the '50s ""juvenile delinquency"" was the big issue and we did have some tools that tried to deal with it, but those were largely discarded, plus they don't apply beyond age 18 or so.  ADDED: Also note the deinstitutionalization of the dangerously insane which started in the '60s and '70s, they're now dumped on the streets or into jails and prisons.<p>A national sweep of ""shall issue"" concealed carry licensing regimes started by Florida in 1987 such that we went from 10% of the population being able to carry concealed to 65% today (not sure if that includes Wisconsin, which flips from no issue to shall issue November 1st).

As you get older, the reality and perception of your ability to defend yourself and your loved ones without a gun (America's martial art, after all) goes down.

1633605,comment,1632689,1632689,0,0,hasenj,,,"Linux may never be a factor on the desktop, but I think Ubuntu has a good chance.<p>Wait. Isn't Ubuntu just a Linux distro? Well, that depends on how you look at it.<p>Is FreeBSD a factor on the desktop? OS X is based on FreeBSD, but no one thinks of FreeBSD as ""a competitor to windows"", or ""a user friendly OS"".<p>Of course, Ubuntu to Linux is <i>not really</i> like OS X is to FreeBSD. Ubuntu didn't invent a new desktop, it's based on Debian and it uses GNOME (or Xfce or KDE). But there's still a point to make here.<p>While the open source community as a whole might fail at designing a great desktop experience, this limitation doesn't necessarily apply to Ubuntu. The design efforts there are lead by Canonical, and it's not horribly fragmented. It has so far produced some pretty decent results. See <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter</a> and <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD</a> as examples.<p>The desktop as a whole is not quite there yet, but it does stand a good chance, and it's already making a lot of strides.",1282759117

1633591,comment,1632878,1633457,0,0,Xurinos,,,"> what do you feel like is the alternative to free will? predestination?<p>I would propose that the alternative is manipulation, and the most extreme form of manipulation is predestination.  Less extreme forms are environmental manipulation, our bacterial collective, and so forth.<p>Was it predestined by God or by some initial atomic movement or potential energy?  We do not have evidence either way, but it is fair to point out the possibilities.  I have my personal belief, which is compatible with both and leaves space for the truth.  I see the topic of free will orthogonal to the topic of gods.<p>We have to be careful here; there are religious beliefs that we humans were granted free will by God.  Within that context, if we learn conclusively that free will does not exist, then there was no gift, and it is a blow towards God, although not necessarily disproving God.  After all, if we are capable of deceit, isn't it possible that God is also capable of deceit?  So what we think we understand from Him might only be what He wants us to see.  We also may not be capable of understanding His reasons.  In the same vein, HE may simply be a purely creative force with no reasoning other than to make a bunch of stuff and let what sticks stick.<p>So I think we can erode belief systems -- and our minds are generally frail enough to sway -- but it will be pretty difficult to disprove a god.  On the other hand, opportunity may arise where a god can be proven.  Perhaps He did reveal himself (several times), and time gave us an easy excuse to forget and deny, to beg for fresh evidence.  Today, what could God possibly do that we cannot do that would conclusively prove His existence?  And why should He bother?",1282758866

1633576,comment,1632629,1632629,0,0,leot,,,"The major difference financially between the stock market and real estate seems to stem from the fact that real estate is costly to manage, and <i>doesn't</i> scale, and thus investment banks and major market players are unable to participate in a big way.<p>My knowledge of the stock market, even if I get a fancy MBA and specialize in finance, still won't be able to compete profitably with institutional investors that have massive pools of capital, inside knowledge, aggregated expertise, and highly optimized trading algorithms.  As an individual investor I have no competitive advantage, even if I'm savvier than 99% of other individuals, because all the spread will be grabbed en masse by the big players.<p>By contrast, the number of non-experts buying and selling real estate, along with its relatively high transaction costs and necessarily local nature, means that even if I were only smarter than, say, 90% of people, I'd be able to do quite well because the spread wouldn't be gobbled up by the  99.999999th percentile financier.<p>As soon as electronically-managed liquidity is thrown in, and transaction costs become substantially lower for an elite subset, then it becomes much less ""worth it"" to participate.  Thus, even REITs, by their very nature, are going to yield a lower return (pre-fees) than clever, well-managed individual real estate investments.",1282758671

Possibly, but in controlling that factor you can attempt to tease out the extent at which it really is the educational attainment rather than simply the IQ.<p>A better way to put is that if IQ was in itself the key to life success then it wouldn't matter if you went to college or not.  Rather, what the data seems to show is that those with high IQs seem to at least have the wisdom to know that educational attainment will be the key their life success.  Quite possibly being tracked into by virtue of a higher IQ.<p>BUT the data should show that regardless of credential, higher IQ yields more success.  But it doesn't show that.<p>Now there are a lot of factors that potentially come into play.  And that was my original point.

So I skimmed and then jumped to the conclusion.<p>Backstory: do most companies suffer their worst exposure from outside attackers hitting them from the Internet, or inside attackers to whom they've given access?<p>While most of our business is software security, our backgrounds are all in general/network security and, when schedules allow, for clients we have good relationships with, we'll do the annual penetration test as well as applications. So: we do a fair number of internal and external network pentests every year.<p>Here's the deal: most large companies do O.K. --- often not great, but not horrific --- on the external pen. But the internal is always a bloodbath.<p>Add to that virtually ever major criminal case or incident report, where, whether or not external attackers were involved, the initial compromise was abetted by an insider.<p>People have been questioning these ""insider threat"" numbers for over a decade now. I'm sure the numbers are broken. Numbers always are. But the notion that the threat is somehow less ""real"" than the external threat is naive, at best.<p>I think people like questioning the severity of insider exposure for two reasons:<p>(1) Security vendors and service providers make most of their money on services that address external threats (PCI assessments, network pentests, scanning, perimeter security devices).<p>(2) Enterprise security personnel know they have no grip whatsoever on internal controls; the most basic defenses and controls would cost tens of millions of dollars to deploy correctly at an F-1000 company; so instead of coming to grips with the risk, they'd much prefer to recast internal incidents as ""black swan"" events outside of their purview.",1282756591

It should be no big deal -- she should have over a $100,000 saved away to smooth out a rough patch like this one.<p>Instead, she lost her house. Instead of keeping the nice, affordable big home she had three minutes from her shop, she increased her commute by 20 minutes in a bigger, more expensive house (with a pool!) she ended up unable to afford.

A few friends have suggested otherwise:<p>http://backtrackapp.com is my app. It's a location tracking app with a web front end and social features. I only built this for the realtime web component, which hasn't been implemented yet. You'll read about this (and why) below.<p>http://glympse.com is the app filing for the patent.<p>====<p>Dear HN,<p>A few weeks ago, I launched my first iPhone app. I am new to the mobile space and to ObjC, so I figured this would be good, fun exercise in building something I wanted to use myself and turning into a product. With ios4 out, the main premise behind the app seemed like a good idea, and nobody else was doing it yet. So I found a trusted friend, and we built the app and companion website in just under three weeks, part time. We waited the standard two weeks to get approved by Apple, and since then, the app has been chugging along for the past couple of weeks with a few sales here and there. We're about to start marketing the app, and we expect sales to increase.<p>We're also planning on updating the app with a few new substantial features. One of these features is the actual killer feature I dreamed the app up for. We decided to scrap it from the first release because the app was full featured enough, we were suffering from mild feature creep, and life was about to get in the way (I had conferences and work deadlines, and we were both moving soon).<p>So what's the problem? A new app has come out that does exactly what our killer feature does. Read: This app does exactly what I built my app for, except my app doesn't even do it yet. Imagine how I feel. It's getting tons of great press, with publications raving about how amazing that feature is, how nothing even comes close, how it's revolutionary in its place, and blah blah blah. That's fine, I'm disappointed at my failure to execute fast enough and be first to market, and as such losing out on press and sales, etc etc; but that's just the life of an entrepreneur: learn and move on.<p>I can live with all of that. The problem is that the new app's website claims they're actually patenting this feature. This I can't get over. My first instinct was to go to uspto.gov and start searching for the application so I could submit an attack on it, somehow. However.. I can't even find it.<p>So I'm at a loss of what to do. \nMy gut says to just get the update with the new feature out as soon as possible, so there's a competitor out, and just let the patent process run its course. I'm sure this is not the best thing to do. I'm not sure if it's appropriate to spend tons of time searching the patent applications for something that may or may not even be patented. I don't want to pivot away from this feature, I think my implementation of it will be much better and more attractive than this competitor. And I'm definitely nowhere near ready to roll over and play dead.<p>So, if you were in my shoes, how would you approach this? Is this even a problem? Or if it becomes one, should I just deal with it as it comes?",1282756318

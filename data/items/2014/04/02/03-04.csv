7513459,comment,7501676,7510354,2,0,shykes,,,"> <i>why in the world are there so many &quot;slight&quot; variations of a build?</i><p>That&#x27;s what happens if you tell all your developers to stop using capistrano, fabric, ftp and heroku, and tell them to create .debs out of EVERYTHING instead. They&#x27;re going to (unhappily) build and install dozens of packages per hour, because that&#x27;s how developers increasingly work: by deploying their stuff very, very frequently.<p>In our case it was the combination of 1) rapid development and staging, 2) different environments for different customers, and 3) numerous, fast-moving  and precise dependencies.<p>1) Rapid development and staging: there are several developers, building from their respective branches. They want to deploy and test their work, sometimes in isolation (dev), sometimes as a team before releasing (staging). The overhead of deploying a new machine every time (virtual or not, in this particular case bare metal was part of the equation) is considered overkill. But that&#x27;s OK, debian package can be named, flavored and versioned, so deployment in parallel should work out, right? Wrong, as it turns out... having to manually &quot;scope&quot; each deployment by generating different package names, flavors and versions basically breaks every assumption of system packaging. And if you want to get a little fancy and, say map particular versions/flavors to particular git commits... Forget it.<p>2) Different environments for different customers. All of the above was multiplied by the fact that this was appliance software - each customer got its own build, which on a good day was stock, and when dealing with more demanding customers, involved various customizations, build options etc. This is business as usual in many &quot;vertical&quot; software markets where the most valuable customers always have some legacy crap software and workflows they need to integrate with.<p>3) Numerous, fast-moving and precise dependencies. This software had lots of dependencies, which exact version of those dependencies, and even how they were built (and the exact build environment) mattered immensely, and the whole thing was a moving target because we frequently patched those dependencies. In this particular company the dependencies had mostly to do with video processing (custom ffmpeg builds etc), but this is also business as usual in many software-intensive organizations. The project rarely fits in a neat Rails or Spring app. There&#x27;s all sorts of libraries, binaries and rpc services floating around - and deb packaging forces you to break all of those down into dependencies, further multiplying the dependency hell that your life already is. It&#x27;s also increasingly typical (and good!) for developers to be very specific about the exact version and build of all their dependencies (from mysql to libssl) because it affects the behavior of their application. So you can&#x27;t just wing it by swapping out their particular postgres setup with something &quot;kind of the same thing&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s the same version, what else do you want?&quot; --> not good enough.<p>> <i>And if they&#x27;re so slight, why do they break things?</i><p>I meant that they break traditional system packaging. Simply put, system packaging is not well designed for applications which A) are made of many components, B) are updated and shipped several times per hour, C) on a large set of heterogeneous machines.<p>... And I didn&#x27;t even mention the case where sales come back saying &quot;the customer wants RPMs...&quot;.<p>Good times.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m sticking to containers and not looking back :)",1396410646

Had he fired or refused to hire someone over their orientation, it would be discriminatory action. That being said, as the CEO of Mozilla, he is the face and voice of Mozilla. So it is natural that people are looking into how he has exercised his speech, not just actions in the past, to see how he will shape Mozilla in the future.<p>I make my living coding in JavaScript/CoffeeScript and my personal hobbies include hacking 3D UIs in the browser. To say that my life was directly and positively impacted by Eich&#x27;s past actions is an understatement. On the other hand, there are many people, more than a few in this very community, who were indirectly and negatively impacted by the small part he played when exercising his right to free speech.<p>To me the bigger question is, can you officially act &#x27;for&#x27; when you personally speak &#x27;against&#x27; something?",1396410227

Doing so can be extremely dangerous to your future career, not least because potentially it will no longer be safe for you to work in certain fields, and you don&#x27;t even know in advance what those fields are. At the same time, it has basically no upside for the person committing not to disclose. It&#x27;s not unusual for employment or freelance contracts to include some clauses about not disclosing trade secrets learned during the gig, but even then there ought to be explicit limits on the scope of any restrictions, as well as other safeguards for the employee/freelancer.<p>If you&#x27;re dealing with a really big player, and you&#x27;re a little player trying to break into a market where you need access to their technology, then accepting their NDA terms <i>might</i> be an unavoidable price of admission where you have no real alternative if you want to play the game. I struggle to imagine why you&#x27;d consider signing one under less demanding conditions, though.<p>The situation described here is not even close to that kind of relationship. It seems more akin to the situation where Idea Guy thinks his idea is so amazing that Technical Guy should be willing to sign anything just to know about it. But try that on any veteran Technical Guy, or any serious investor, and Idea Guy will get laughed out of the room. In this case, it makes even less sense, because it sounds like any relevant information has already been shared anyway and there is literally no upside at all to signing anything like this.<p>There also seems to be some sort of presumption that OP would be the subordinate in any relationship and the other person would be senior. It&#x27;s not clear why that would make sense from what we&#x27;ve been told so far, because it sounds like the OP has been the one doing most/all of the work so far. However, business people sometimes forget that good technical people aren&#x27;t under any obligation to work for peanuts, and then they make unfounded assumptions about how they should obviously be the senior player in any deal. A counter-offer where they only get to have a minority share of the equity in a new company owned by both people, or even where they are reduced to being an employee of a company founded by the technical person, may provide an effective reality check in such situations, because without the technical person&#x27;s work it&#x27;s entirely possible that the business person has nothing of value to build a company around.<p>On the bright side, there is at least one useful lesson here, because it has provided an excellent demonstration of one of the most reliable indicators that you you don&#x27;t want to engage in any sort of business relationship with someone. :-)",1396410143

There&#x27;s just a guild that where the academy was still debating the utility of CAD in the year 2000 - I know, I was there. It&#x27;s still not sold on Building information modeling - aka &quot;using a database.&quot;<p>In so far as architecture is a science, actual buildings are its experiments [an idea stolen from E. H. Gombrich] Unlike a program, there&#x27;s one shot at the artifact - the building gets built and the budget spent and there&#x27;s no way to do test driven development or serious integration testing, let alone refactoring or versioning.  The plans are like code and the construction process is their one and only pass through the compiler.<p>Anyway, you might find something in an architectural school library on office layout, but in practice a few pages from something like Time Saver Standards for Building Types is about as much reading as a practicing architect is going to do. The big drivers of schema are soft - the psychology of clients and the architect&#x27;s empathy for those who have to inhabit the space...that&#x27;s the whole of whether offices in the core and serfs by the windows gets built or not [and that&#x27;s not the way to bet].<p>With a specific open office space, bringing in the modular systems vendor is how the actual layout of cubicles is done. The reason is that architecture is commoditized to the point that chasing through endless swaps of Suzy and Joe and Clay among the cubicles [and whose name goes where is an O(n^3) PITA] and only the person actually selling systems furniture  can afford the handholding (unless you&#x27;re Frank Gehrey and explicitly getting paid to do it and able to assign a $15 an hour intern with an March from Harvard&#x27;s GSA).<p>If I were inclined to argumentation I&#x27;d point out that architecture was a couple of thousand years old when Vitrivuvious dedicated his 10 books to Augustus Caesar and thus you can pretty much be assured that any proposition that links software and architecture is grounded in all that history and floating free upon the mere sixty years that the concept of software has existed.<p>Habraken&#x27;s <i>Structure of the Ordinary</i> is the way territoriality and control express themselves spatially and I find it informative for the sort of problems upon whose solution good office design depends. It&#x27;s not rules for layout but the effects that various configurations create.<p><a href=""http://www.habraken.com/html/structure_of_the_ordinary.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.habraken.com/html/structure_of_the_ordinary.htm</a><p>Anyway, if there ever was a field of obsolescence ripe for disruption, it would be architecture here and now - and of course it&#x27;s already happening. The infrastructure needed to provide many services ain&#x27;t no building any more. The guild thinks technological progress is faster horses to speed up the production of drawings - or to anchor the analogy better pens. The idea of providing better solutions is inconsistent with the model of architecture as craft because a better solution might not require a building and with a business model that couples fees to a percentage of construction cost, there&#x27;s no money in it.<p>Gosh, that was fun.",1396409769

In the case of the latter, that world needs to die, and I&#x27;m all about progress and moving past such suffocating, stagnating, backward nonsense.<p>Also, when it comes to programming, after about 5 years everyone evens out (with regards to gains unique/specific to years of experience) and there isn&#x27;t really much difference. Everything past that is mostly inside knowledge or factual knowledge that you get from happening to work at one company or another (or with some person that happens to know said things). And since the technological landscape (past whatever the latest buzzwords or fads are) changes at least every 5 years, all that specific knowledge loses relevance with time.",1396409750

7513329,comment,7511979,7511979,11,0,hibikir,,,"We do not have a general purpose tree editor because trees are quite the complicated structure, and most valuable operations on trees require quite a bit of knowledge of what the tree represents.<p>Look at, for instance, source code. In many languages, we represent code in a tree-like structure, just with text and braces/parenthesis/tabs as indentations. But we all know that there are major limitations on how to represent a class. If you have 200 methods in a class, said class is unwieldy. If your methods are very deep, the whole thing also becomes unwieldy, so we make them smaller. We&#x27;d still do that with huge monitors that could show lots and lots of code at once: Without abstraction, any nested structure is hard to manage.<p>Many text editors will collapse levels for you, but really, how often do you all use them? Whenever you need to use them, it&#x27;s a smell, because it means that the structure is getting too complex for a mind to handle.<p>This is not an issue that is unique to code. Any tree structure has the same issue of abstraction: We are not designed to handle more than one layer at a time, unless we are dealing with a tiny number of nodes. We have trouble seeing trees and navigating trees, so of course we can&#x27;t have good general tree editors. I&#x27;ve seen four attempts at just general tree visualizers at work in the last year. The most successful barely pay lip service to regular tree &#x27;views&#x27;, and instead try to answer secondary questions that would help us know how we want to explore the tree.<p>And, as others here have already said, there&#x27;s always non graphical representations. find, awk and grep can go very far when you are trying to find things on a tree.

7513327,comment,7508350,7513076,1,0,JoeAltmaier,,,"It works; its just far more complicated. Because its not about the IP stack at all. Its about the routers/firewalls and NAT. It goes something like this.<p>Something called &#x27;pinholes&#x27; are created in your router - a map between an internal address-triplet (IP:Port:Protocol) and an external address-triplet. Messages arriving from one are mapped to the other and forwarded.<p>In addition, a third address-triplet can be used to guard against port-scanning and malicious bots etc. It&#x27;s used on external (public) packets to test the Source of the packet. Its built from the 1st packet send out that created the NAT entry, from the public address target of that packet.<p>In other words, incoming traffic is only translated and forwarded to your computer/port if it came from somebody you previously SENT a packet to, such that your NAT entry has that address as its &#x27;filter&#x27; triplet.<p>UDP can send arbitrary packets to anybody. TCP MUST start with a connection exchange where a client first tries to contact a server. But in our case we want them to be peers; both &#x27;clients&#x27;.<p>So, TCP &#x27;pinhole&#x27; creation involves both clients simultaneously attempting to open a socket to each other. Both clients must be prepared to accept (listen) for that attempt. Initially each outgoing client connection attempt may be rejected by the peer&#x27;s router - if it hasn&#x27;t previously attempted to talk back to that peer yet, there is no NAT entry with a matching filter triplet.<p>It has to be nearly simultaneous because TCP connection retry can be large, and it takes a minimum of 2 tries (one to create the NAT entry but fail arriving at the peer, the 2nd MAY succeed if the peer has also created a NAT entry at exactly the same time).<p>Add to that, learning your public address Requires contacting some STUN/ICE style public server, which creates your NAT entry but marks it with the STUN server filter triplet. So the peer connection is actually a 2nd attempt to create a pinhole. If your router doesn&#x27;t overwrite that NAT entry&#x27;s STUN triplet with the peer triplet, or create a multi-way associative table entry, or incompletely updates the triplet (IP but not port or IP/Port but not protocol) then the peer&#x27;s incoming client-connect will be rejected anyway.<p>Since port-scanning and malicious bots are not in any way an official protocol, every router manufacturer invents their own algorithm for defending against them. There is no guarantee that any particular NAT-pinhole-creation technique will work every time with any particular router.<p>So no, TCP isn&#x27;t really a superset; in a real way its a much more restricted set, and p2p TCP works far less often in practice than UDP. Because for UDP you control every packet, and send to exactly the addresses in exactly the order you wish. So you have far more control over the initial exchange content and timing, and thus have more control over pinhole creation.",1396408637

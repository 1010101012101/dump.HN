Here's one (slightly dated) meta-analysis that does find some association with aggression, especially following watching porn that involves violence: <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1995.tb00368.x/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1995....</a>",1322773149

More balance.<p>Iron Man Helmet - Manditory for all company events, I'm assuming.

3301350,comment,3299940,3299940,2,0,earbitscom,,,"> <i>Think really hard about whether you actually need that business cofounder.  Consider investing the time you'll spend looking for someone with improving your own sales/marketing/product skills.  Join a community like Y Combinator and they'll help you learn all the mysterious business stuff that isn't actually that hard.  In the end, if you make something people want, everything else will fall into place.</i><p>Honestly, the attitude toward ""non-technical co-founders"" needs to change in this community and the fact that anyone would say you don't really need one is just naive.  Build it and they will come is a Silicon Valley pipe dream that happens to .1% of companies.  Talking to customers, exploring competitive products, negotiating service contracts, firing up potential employment candidates, getting press, lining up distribution partners, selling clients, exploring new markets for potential leads, managing non-technical resources, fund raising, pitch writing, and more are just a handful of the things that a ""non-technical co-founder"" can be doing.  Doing them yourself when you can find someone more experienced or focused on this is poor management of resources and speaks to an inability to delegate or manage limited company time and resources.<p>Having been through YC, I can tell you right now that not only will they not teach you ""all the mysterious business stuff"", but if you think ""business stuff"" isn't actually that hard, you work with shitty business people and aren't aggressive enough in your initiatives.<p>Everybody likes to downplay the importance of business people in startups.  My first co-founder and I in Earbits were both non-technical.  While we looked for a technical co-founder we lined up an advisory board from Google and EMI Music, raised friends and family money, recruited a designer for equity only to mock up our site and design our logo/brand, and had record labels sending us boxes of CDs for a radio platform that didn't even exist yet.  During that time, three technical people flaked on our project, one of them after signing the paperwork to join.  Do you see me talking about the lack of importance or reliability of technical people?  No.  Your bad experience or rumors about shitty business people are unfounded.  Most successful companies have a solid business-oriented co-founder.  For every crappy ""idea guy"" there is a flaky developer.",1322772822

The danger in a solution like sink.js is it becomes ""good enough"" until people need more than it can provide.  Then they turn to the APIs and end up dealing with fragmentation.<p>If you think about it that's exactly what happened with IE circa Version 5.  The one good thing IE did was make it possible to develop for one browser.  What the industry should have done then was what they're doing with HTML5 now.  Define a standard so other competitors could enter the market without creating fragmentation.  But that's not what happened and now everyone has to write for 3 browsers (if not more thanks to IE7,8,and 9)<p>Same with sink.js.  For all the bad in Flash almost everyone has it and it's a consistent thing you can write to.  If people use sink.js now and don't pay attention to the fragmented APIs underneath we'll end up having to write to 3 different APIs down the line.<p>So again I'm not against sink.js.

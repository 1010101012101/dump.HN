9483598,comment,9482483,9483486,0,0,jlouis,,,"Hmm, thinking some more on this, this holds locally in Erlang, but not in the distributed communication. If we have m1: A1 -> A2, m2: A1 -> A3 and then in m3: A3 -> A2, then the message ordering will always be that m1 comes before m3 in A2 (locally).<p>Locally, a message pass never fails and always delivers the message directly. It can&#x27;t be in-flight, so m1 is placed in the mailbox before m2 happens, and thus m3 will always come later.<p>In the distributed setting, A1, A2 and A3 might be living on three different nodes, and then m1 might get delayed on the TCP socket while m2 and m3 goes through quickly. Thus we observe the reverse ordering, m3 followed by m1. This is probably why the causal ordering constraint is dropped in Erlang. Is pony distributed?",1430697530

People that consent to polygraphs despite their obvious flaws and interact well with people willing to conduct them despite those same flaws are more likely to continue or encourage the use of polygraphs than others. It doesn&#x27;t require conspiracy. At the same time, the continued use of polygraphs for so long given how public and documented their flaws are allows us to ask what actual selective function they are serving in the system. Besides institutional inertia, the only two compelling explanations are as a proxy for biases of the polygraph operators (which must play a part given that polygraphs are not deterministic, robust detection mechanisms) and as a selective pressure for people who don&#x27;t have qualms with these types of systemic dysfunction.",1430696211

Especially when it&#x27;s in an AST, which, even if it&#x27;s the sort of compiler that mutably updates its AST, probably isn&#x27;t going to have surprise updates to source-position-tied attributes at macro-expansion time.  Especially not when you have some basic const correctness to convince you of this in C++ (the equivalent of what we&#x27;re seeing in this Rust code), but even in C and without const safety, and with a compiler that practices mutating an AST (with metadata) in-place, this would be a comfortable thing to do.  (In C there&#x27;d be a clearly named function that adds &quot;internal&quot; attributes and you&#x27;d see its existence and where it&#x27;s getting called, while in C++ if you didn&#x27;t have type safety you&#x27;d make the field private, give the functions modifying it funny names, and grep for them.)",1430696141

The post is talking about automatically figuring out that nobody knows the Pid of a process and hence that process can be reclaimed. This is a transitive notion: If a group of processes can&#x27;t be &quot;reached&quot; from another group and the latter group is the &quot;important&quot; one, then you can just kill off the first group of proceses. This is why it is GC-like behaviour. Like in a GC, processes can &quot;leak&quot; if you forget to throw the Pid away.<p>Erlang&#x27;s method is to form linked webs of processes and then the death of a process &quot;poisons the web&quot; and kills off all processes in the web. By trapping exits, you can put in stopgaps for this behaviour, which is what supervisors do, among other things.<p>Process handling in Erlang is more akin to &quot;manual memory management&quot; or ARC/RAII style memory management here.",1430694377

I&#x27;ve traveled the US a bit, but I&#x27;ve had little chance to leave the country. While I&#x27;m young and mobile I&#x27;d like to make the move across the ocean, so that I can cut the biggest hurdle to traveling to far off countries. In particular I was looking into London, so that I could have a home base with a familiar language and culture, but within a few hours flight of most places I want to see.<p>The issue is that I have no idea how to find a job without moving there first. Unfortunately, I have no contacts overseas to reach out to. I would not be going alone, and we are not in a financial situation to handle move overseas, and handle unemployment for months before finding a job.<p>Some of the questions that I have, that I have not seen any quick answers to:<p>1. Do I need a visa or any other special paperwork before applying for a foreign job?<p>2. Is the cost of relocating from the US too high of a cost for companies to consider me?<p>3. How do I even go about finding jobs in a specific city like London?<p>4. Most of my work has been for the government and naturally closed off. I do small side projects when I can, but I don&#x27;t have any sort of jaw dropping set of open-source contributions. I feel like this has been a hinderance for other jobs that I have applied to, and could amplify the perceived risk as I noted in number 2.<p>5. I have an additional complication of security clearance, sponsored by my current company. Before traveling overseas I must get it cleared with our security officer. I&#x27;m not sure if there are any extra steps I have to take before applying to a foreign company. Obviously I&#x27;m a little hesitant to just go and ask him, letting him know that I&#x27;m looking to leave the company.<p>I know that many people on here have gone through similar situations, so any advice or leads would be appreciate, thanks.",1430694184

People used to refer to them as ""beige boxes.""<p>After his return, Jobs managed to turn Macs into fashion accessories, first with the iMac. This put the Mac into a category where it wasn't competing directly with PCs, where it's been ever sense.<p>But let's not kid ourselves. Apple lost the battle for the desktop computer in the 80s, and it never regained it. Jobs returned Apple to profitability by giving up on that market and positioned the company into a new one.<p>One difference that the OP failed to mention, between desktop computers and cellphones, is that cellphones are worn and therefore have always had an element of fashion to them.

What is a bigger deal is how fast the <i>latest</i> OS/API gets adopted. iOS can push out the new version in <i>days</i> to at least 50%-75% of the users, while for Android it takes about a year to be on 75% of the devices (that's how long it took for Gingerbread).<p>And the issue with that is that users don't get to take advantage too much of the most cutting edge software, until months after release, when (or if) they get their upgrade, while on iOS they can do that just days later.",1333183925

3779852,comment,3778958,3779283,23,0,suby,,,"I'm going to school right now to become a court reporter / stenographer.  Basically, I type on a funny looking keyboard (<a href=""http://www.acculaw.com/images/products/display/stenograph%20diamante%20pink%20g.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acculaw.com/images/products/display/stenograph%20...</a>) where you're not so much typing letters as much as you're typing sounds.  So the word ""talk"", for example would be written ""tauk"", with each letter of the word pressed at the same time (if possible.  Some words you need to come back for a second, third, or god forbid forth stroke).<p>You have to write at 225 words a minute in order to graduate, but some people are able to write at speeds of 300+ words a minute.  If you look at the keyboard, the machine is separated into two halves.  On the left half there are only 9 keys, but each letter of the alphabet can be written with those 9 keys because it's context sensitive.  The letter ""t"" by itself would be the letter t, but if it's next to a ""k"", it might become the letter d.  You mentioned that we can knock out certain letters such as c, and that's indeed what is done with stenography.  The word ""car"" is written ""kar"".  There are sometimes conflicts, like ""sell"" and ""cell"", so you still need a way to write a c, but that's the gist of it.<p>Worth mentioning is that there are only 4 vowel keys on the machine (the vowels are the keys that are on the bottom), but you can write a lot of different sounds with these four keys.  A, O, E, and U are the vowels that are on there, and if you press one of those keys individually, you'd write a short vowel of that key.  If you wanted to write a short I, you'd press E and U together.  You would write long vowel sounds by combining different vowels together.  So for example, if you wanted to write a long e sound, you'd write aoe, long U sound would be aou, long a sound would be ai (or aeu depending on how you look at it), long o is oe, and long i is all the vowels together at once.<p>It can be hard to read what you've written if you're not extremely good at it.  The word dime, for example, you would see as ""TKAOEUPL"".  There are a few different theories out there, and even if everyone learns the same theory, everyone puts their own little spin on it, so if you wanted to read what someone else wrote, it might be tough.<p>This is the layout of the keyboard if anyone is interested (<a href=""http://dmc122011.delmar.edu/ba/crtrgallery/images/steno_keyboard_chart_jpg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dmc122011.delmar.edu/ba/crtrgallery/images/steno_keyb...</a>)",1333183839

3779839,comment,3779672,3779672,11,0,ericd,,,"I really, really hate supporting an app on Android. This is a big part of the reason for that.<p>As an example, at one point it apparently would simply refuse to start on the Droid X, despite running great on the original Droid I had to test it with, and the VM I set up to emulate the X. Without access to a physical Droid X, it couldn't be debugged. The app doesn't require anything from the hardware besides a GPS, so I was at a loss for what would cause this.<p>Because it's a huge pain to properly test new versions, I tend not to keep the Android version up to speed with the iOS version of the same app. As a result of that, I get a lot of complaints from Android users that feel short changed and bad reviews from people who feel like the app isn't keeping pace with the alternative apps (mostly they use the web app as reference).<p>It's just a really crappy situation. I've thought about dropping Android support, but then they would just complain that the iOS crowd get an app and they don't, so that wouldn't be much better.

We build apps for carriers (account management apps), brands, etc.<p>From my own personal experience, which having built apps since the first iOS SDK and Android 1.6 is hopefully fairly reliable, the QA and testing burden on Android apps is <i>considerably higher</i> than iOS.<p>That in itself isn't totally surprising, because there are far more handsets on the market. But that's not the real issue: say I'm writing an app for a network carrier. Carriers typically want their apps to run on all hardware they've sold for the past two years (ie, everyone who's still under contract).<p>On iOS, that's iOS 3-5. Very soon, it'll be iOS 4-5 - 4 was released in June 2010.<p>On Android, that's 1.6, 2.0, 2.2, 2.3, 3.0, and 4.0. Because the <i>key difference</i> is when Apple release a new version of iOS, they stop selling the old one. But that's not the case with Android. Even today there are still phones on the market running 2.1.<p>When you say ""the same fragmentation exists on iPhone but smaller in quantities"" - I don't really think you know what you're talking about. If you're developing an app now you can pretty easily support iOS 4.3 upwards, which would cover all handsets being actively sold by Apple for the past 21 months or so (the 3GS onwards, or three phone models and two tablets)). How many Android phones running how many versions have been released in the past 21 months? Far, far more.<p>This doesn't inherently make Android a bad platform: lots of people choose to develop PC games even though there's a much higher testing burden that consoles (in terms of the varying environments and OS versions). I think Android is great: I'm not arguing against developing for it. But I think you'd be very hard pressed to find someone experienced with both the iOS and Android platforms who'd disagree with the notion that fragmentation on Android takes up a lot more time to deal with than iOS.",1333182429

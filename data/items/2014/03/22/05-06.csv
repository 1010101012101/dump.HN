It would have to be equal to work and that would only last for a while, hence my comment that it would have to re-adjust frequently.<p>Just like salaries have gone up over time yet the value of a dollar has shrunk, there would only be a momentary boom from the extra money and then the market, as markets purpose is, will find the value and adjust.  It would keep things in more of a wave though like when minimum wage goes up, there is a temporary boom to low end markets but it always makes it back to the current distribution (I think minimum wage is a good thing).  The money given would always find the way back up through pricing with a basic income though. Apartments suddenly would be x% higher and price increases because there is more money out there and if more actual printed then pricing has to come up.  It is a forever balance and the only way to break it I can see is to ramp up the ladder individually.<p>Markets run everything and they are good, we would still all be farming and dumb if there weren&#x27;t markets to trade goods for services. Markets and exchanges created conditions for the need for mathematics and allowed people have more free time as they could make products and sell them. This led to more time to think and create/innovate and the reason we have mathematics and technology today.  But markets do find fair product to market/user value. Markets are as key to innovation and the evolution of human intelligence as anything. But they will always normalize after infusion, just recently we infused it from the top to banks, which may have kept us from the brink of destruction but only to get it back to &#x27;balanced&#x27;. Why didn&#x27;t they instead just give everyone 6k? Monetary distribution, unless we go away from markets/currency as value, will be pretty close to what we have now always (doesn&#x27;t mean individuals can&#x27;t climb it).<p>It could be proven that we all think like the wealthy on this, once a human gets ahead, they don&#x27;t want to lose that ground or progress.  Case in point the US, if you live in the US like I do, we might have a higher quality of life and currency status than many parts of the world.  Would you give that up to allow all countries in the world to be equal in monetary value? If you aren&#x27;t in the US how about where you live? The people above the fold want to keep it that way, the people below will want it another way, the people above the fold create the game rules, repeat until entropy.",1395467986
7447919,comment,7445761,7447697,4,0,comex,,,"I have 4663 karma after 958 comments and 21 submissions in a bit under 4 years.  Out of that:<p>- 2908 is comment karma; 1804 is post karma.  (The total adds up to a bit too much; I&#x27;m probably miscalculating.)<p>Out of the post karma, <i>1634</i> was gained by 5 submissions which made it onto the front page and acquired hundreds of karma.  None of the posts I submitted, including those, were written by me.  (I&#x27;d like to start a blog, but I&#x27;m too lazy and shy for now.)  And in my opinion, the value I contributed to the community simply by submitting them is rather low; considering that I&#x27;ve frequently tried to submit a story I found especially likely to generate interesting HN discussion only to find it already submitted, it&#x27;s more likely that I won a race.  On the other end, it&#x27;s well accepted that whether a post manages to get a few points to bring it out of /new before it gets buried is somewhat random - IMHO some of my other submissions were just as good, but they didn&#x27;t bite for whatever reason - making the correlation between value and post karma even more skewed.<p>- The comment karma histogram is a bit less lopsided: my top 100 comments (i.e. the top 3%) are responsible for about half of it (1469).  But on the other end, 48% of my comments ended up with 1 or 2 points; while many of my comments are bad, I suspect that the difference is more about being seen than the top rated comments being that much better than the 1 pointers.<p>Also, if you sort by <i>comment length</i>, which is to some extent a reasonable proxy for quality, only 537 karma was earned by the top 100.  Many of my top rated comments are relatively simple rebuttals to (in my opinion) bad comments; in my opinion, these can be valuable (since articulating why a comment is wrong is much more useful than simply downvoting it, and most comments never get responded to), but aren&#x27;t as valuable as the long ones.<p>It probably doesn&#x27;t help that (I think) I&#x27;m much more likely to respond to other comments (and try to have a discussion, the very thing that this change makes difficult :() than to comment on the post itself.<p>In my not-so-humble opinion, if you have the time and volubility to constantly make long, good comments on popular posts, you&#x27;ll be rewarded.  But if you don&#x27;t, because the vast majority of comments will net you nothing, you&#x27;ll get more by optimizing for quantity and being first to the scene, hoping for a small number of posts and comments to semi-randomly get a large fraction of the karma, than pre-selecting for quality.<p>Which, come to think of it, sounds a lot like how Y Combinator makes its money.<p>Oh, and submit a lot of posts.",1395467945

Communism didn&#x27;t work because it <i>destroyed every incentive for industrious, honest labour, supplanting healthy competitive free-market economics with a landscape of scheming and parasitism as people scrambled to exploit one another.</i><p>Communism failed (and will fail every single time another stupid generation which hasn&#x27;t even bothered to pay attention to the past implements its ideas again) because, under Communism, <i>there is no economy.</i><p>Communism is a terrible, terrible idea. Just like all coercive redistribution, which, proportional to the degree of redistribution, destroys economic growth. It&#x27;s no accident that, other than a handful of tight-knit low-population nation cum communities with large oil stakes, the number of socialist policies enacted by a legislature correlates directly with poor economic performance.<p>The tragedy is that populations suffering from the negative effects of these policies delude themselves into thinking that an expansion of the policies will fix their woes, rather than hard work and smart investment.

I like to think of HN as the one online community where the comments are usually on point and there&#x27;s no &quot;power user&quot; bullshit going on.<p>Slashdot devolved into irrelevant memes by their moderation point system. Every Subreddit eventually becomes an echo chamber. Only on hacker news can you find very divergent opinions expressed side by side without banning, censoring, downvoting or trolling. I&#x27;m not saying that pending comments will destroy that, but I already while writing this comment I&#x27;m worried about being liked by the big guys. New people with valid opinions who might not know how to appeal to the site&#x27;s group-think will have a bad time. People with poor language skills will have a bad time.

Is an artist who works night and day and gets pennies in return lazy? There&#x27;s a lot of overhead in deciding this. A lot.<p>You get money if someone agrees to pay you for goods or services rendered.  Period.  No overhead.<p>There will always be unfortunately situations.  Charity and family can help.  Knowing there will be consequences for your actions and that you can&#x27;t ask people to bail you out is another.<p>They definitely aren&#x27;t lazy.  I greatly respect those people.  I&#x27;m still not going to pay for their lifestyle though.<p>In the case of the artist, I was in that situation.  Minimum wage would have been an order of magnitude more than I was making.  When it didn&#x27;t work out, I took responsibility for my situation and changed what I was doing to something that society would pay for.<p>I got a day job and it sucked.  I hated it.  I moved into a warehouse with a friend to save money and so I could pay off my $30K of credit card debt faster, I built myself a room with lumber purchased on credit card, built in the evenings after I got off of work, hands numb from all the hammering I was doing when framing (which I had to teach myself how to do), getting woken up at 6 AM every morning to the sound of industrial saws and compressors from the unit next door, trying to work on the weekends when it was 100 degrees in my room because there was no AC, paying $500/mo in credit card interest, buying food on credit card, having my friend pay down my credit card with checks I would endorse to him because any checks I deposited in my bank account would be seized by the IRS because I didn&#x27;t have enough money to pay my taxes.  Then to make matters worse my friend and I got laid off.  So, we decided to try to make our own startup and worked our asses off.  When the finances couldn&#x27;t bare I decided to give in and find a normal day job again.<p>Yeah, it sucked.  But I didn&#x27;t whine about how I&#x27;m a victim and how others need to give me their hard earned money.  I manned up, took responsibility, changed what I was doing, and slowly over the course of many years dug myself out of the situation.  I wasn&#x27;t doing what I wanted to but I was digging myself out of the hole I dug from my failed ventures.  Eventually I completely paid off my credit cards, and car loan.  I even got a motorcycle to make the commute easier and paid that off completely as well.  Now I&#x27;m making decent money at a place I enjoy doing programming, saving up and trying to figure out how to invest in real estate.  I had to go through some lousy programming jobs before I found the good ones.<p>I went from a really horrible situation, deeply in debt, no college degree, and now I&#x27;m doing well for myself.  I don&#x27;t see why I should be forced to pay so others don&#x27;t have to work as hard and/or make the hard decisions to grind through what needs to be done.<p>So yeah, people may be in some really crappy situations.  So what?  They need to stop whining, stop expecting handouts, and do something about it.<p>> So, my point that art is only worth it&#x27;s value to the general population stands. That makes it more entertainment than art. Please note the distinction.<p>Noted.  I see the difference.  But that begs the question, what is the value of something that society doesn&#x27;t value?  lol<p>I&#x27;m not changing my mind that people should get to do whatever they find interesting at other people&#x27;s expense though.<p>> However, I do think there&#x27;s something to be said for giving people more of an opportunity to do what they like. After all, we all tend to do better work when we&#x27;re doing something we want to be doing.<p>Ideally yes.  As technology grows people need to work less and less and they will have more time to pursue their own interests.  Also, if you want to pursue your own interests, go through the grind first.  Once you have resources you will have more time and money to pursue your interests.  It&#x27;s much easier to work hard first and then enjoy things, than to dig yourself into a hole because you don&#x27;t have the resources.  Trust me.  I know.  lol<p>I actually saved up for years at a job I hated before I felt I had enough money to do the photography.  I failed miserably, but then I did what any toddler would do.

That is removed by the ACA, and that costs extra too.<p>Also, there is extra cost because insurers now need to cover existing conditions - allowing you to change providers if you are already sick.<p>All of these extra things make it more expensive for some, but a better overall coverage - if you have catastrophic illness, you may have not been covered at the top end for all of these costs on your old plan.<p>Younger people tend not to think about catastrophic issues like 3+ years of cancer treatment, because new treatments are a) expensive and b) may extend your life significantly, so you may actually hit your $2M lifetime maximum, and then you are on your own, until you&#x27;re bankrupt, and then the state (i.e. taxpayers) would help you out.<p>So, taken over 50+ years (not just this year&#x27;s numbers) these new plans actually provide much better coverage, and may even take pressure off the Taxpayers for those that are under covered for their medical issues.",1395464646

There has be better way to rank the comments considering you have so much information, specifically, graph of people with karma values upvoting/downvoting each other. Can&#x27;t we just do simple variant of PageRank to rank comments? You can even simplify thing by having child comments inherit rank of parent (or may be adjusted rank). Individual users can set the noise level that they find acceptable in their profile. I strongly believe this is a ranking issue and shouldn&#x27;t be left to humans with all of their potential to bias things.<p>Proposed system might work ok on head posts but there are lot of tail posts which have smaller audiences but interesting topics nonetheless. On those posts, minority opinions or &quot;ridiculous ideas&quot; would have lower probability of getting endorsed.",1395464628

I posted then deleted this in the old thread.<p>As a long time lurker and reader of HN I really hope that you reconsider this change. I made an account just to explain why I dread the impact of this change on the quality, openness, and character of discourse at HN.<p>Put bluntly this change inspires a visceral feeling of loss and disappointment in me. I have viewed HN as a community where anyone can participate fully if they have something useful to say. This change feels like it will destroy this character of HN and turn it into a system where elites will have all the knowledge of a discussion and the rest of us will not. They will be able to incorporate ideas into their own posts before others can and can choose which ideas get general airtime. Particularly in low traffic stories this feels unjust and noninclusive.<p>I really enjoy reading the comment threads at HN and some of the best comments come as replies to comments that are unlikely to get endorsed in this system. This is because this system contains powerful disincentives for approving anything other than comments that will universally be viewed as high quality. If you approve enough comments that are viewed as low quality by moderators you will lose your ability to even view non approved comments and therefore your ability as an elite to fully participate in discourse at HN.<p>When this goes live hopefully people will be very very liberal with approving comments and people will do the public service of approving most comments in a pending global queue quickly. For me it will be very sad that I cannot read the lone, often very informative, comment to a story that will never make it to the front page but that nonetheless I and other lurkers want to see any response at all to the story. I am willing to read the trolls if I am allowed to read those who will be neglected by +1000 karma users.",1395464414

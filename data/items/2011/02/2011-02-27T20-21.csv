Several developers can work on the same project at the same time and not step on each others' toes (esp. thanks to modern version control). This works great with the open source model.<p>Design, on the other hand, benefits from being unified and consistent. The best-designed projects have one designer, or a small group of designers working together closely.

Philips thought they were working on a 14 bit system, until Sony changed the spec to be 16 bits. That wasn't because Sony changed their minds about 'the limits of human hearing', it was because they thought they could implement the technology. 30 years later we can implement a bit depth of 24 bits with no problems.<p>According to the Wikipedia article on the history of the Compact Disc (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc</a>) the sampling rate was defined for the following reason:<p>""the exact sampling rate of 44.1 kHz was inherited from a method of converting digital audio into an analog video signal for storage on U-matic video tape, which was the most affordable way to transfer data from the recording studio to the CD manufacturer at the time the CD specification was being developed.""<p>So again this has absolutely nothing to do with 'the limits of human hearing'.<p>Recording engineers, such as Barry Diament of Soundkeeper Recordings, think that the sound of 24/192 digital matches the output of the live microphone input of their recording desk. Barry Diament doesn't think 16/44.1 is nearly as good.<p>If you buy a recording at a high resolution you can always encode it as an MP3 or ACC so that it fits on your portable player. On the other hand if you buy an MP3 or AAC recording you can't bring back the lost resolution. So if I can fit my entire CD collection onto a cheap 1 TB hard drive, why do we care about how much disk space high resolution 24/96 or 24/192 audio will take up? When you don't have physical media it is trivial for a site to offer a range of resolutions according to the needs of the buyer. If I want 24/96 and someone else is only interested in 128 kps MP3s, then we can both download from the same site and only pay for the quality we need.",1298837890

I've used it a LOT to install various Oracle software over the years.  Fire up a VNC server session as an Oracle user, connect into it at the client site or office and start the installation.  You can then disconnect, go home, do whatever, and connect in again remotely from another location (tunnelled over SSH usually), and the install will still be there running.  It might have paused waiting for a dialogue to be answered, but it hasn't killed the install like logging out of the main desktop would have done.<p>You can also set the colour depth to be used by the client, thereby increasing performance over crappy SSH connections.  8-bit colour takes WAY less data than 32-bit, especially when installers have stupid meaningless animated gifs that run all the time.",1298837733

But what he really wanted to know was whether unrehearsed tosses -- by ordinary folk who flip coins with unpredictable speeds and heights and catch them at different angles -- would show that the outcome of the act was, in fact, random.<p>...Diaconis first approached statistics Associate Professor Susan Holmes, who is also his wife, and asked if he could try her computer's camera.<p>...""What that means is, when I'm stuck on a problem, I feel free to call somebody who's an expert and try to talk them into helping.""<p>While he and Holmes were analyzing the coin toss images, for instance, coffee-shop conversations with physics professors Kapitulnik and Stephen Shenker spurred them to consider the effects of air resistance, an important factor they had neglected in previous analyses.<p>...Several months ago, Diaconis recognized that Andersen's work in the statistical mechanics of fluids sounded similar to a mathematical theory being developed by of one of his colleagues, mathematics Professor Horng-Tzer Yau, who came to Stanford last fall.<p>...Mathematics doctoral student Joe Blitzstein agrees, noting that the most important thing he's learned from Diaconis, his thesis adviser, is ""how to recognize that one problem is really the same as another, in a different guise.""<p>...Though Diaconis had made a key conceptual leap by connecting falling cats and flipped coins, he still hadn't found a camera that could adequately capture the complex motion of a split-second coin toss.   Without these images, it would be impossible to derive the quantitative model needed to calculate the size of a coin flip's predicted bias. ...  Over a latte at Bytes CafÃ© in the Packard Electrical Engineering Building a year ago, Diaconis asked Wandell, an expert in human vision and color perception, if he knew anything about slow-motion photography. ...

Convincing another to take on the work on their behalf is always a possibility, but it should not be hard to see why design changes proposed through such a channel will often be pushed to the back of the queue, unless for some dire need.<p>Designer or coder, there is no excuse for not doing due diligence in making sure a contribution is a good contribution.<p>Looking at the discussion so far, there appears to be at least some consensus that non-trivial effort above and beyond the (hopefully) expected hand-holding must be dedicated to designers in order for them to become good contributors. And, in corollary, the natural conclusion is that it's unrealistic to expect designers to put in the necessary effort to become good contributors on their own.<p>Following from the above, the more crucial questions, I think, are ""How do we convince projects that they should go out of their way to attract designers"", and, ""Do you really need designers?

The same answer does <i>not</i> apply to everyone.<p>* Many small companies don&#x27;t have a large wage bill (outside SV), and don&#x27;t have lots of devs or a sysadmin, instead they tend to have devs who do the sysadmin too.<p>* Heroku can be significantly more expensive than other options like VPS which also don&#x27;t require managing hardware (your RAID example) - for some businesses not burning VC money, that makes a big difference. In your example of $1000, you could probably serve the same customers with $100 a month using VPS servers.<p>* Dynos are not the only cost, you&#x27;ll be charged for storage too, and $1000/month is not a rounding error for many businesses starting out<p>* As your business scales Heroku would become more and more costly - there have been reports of clients being charged things like $20000 a month when they start to hit scale.<p>* They&#x27;ve had more than a few major incidents in this year alone: <a href=""https://status.heroku.com/uptime"" rel=""nofollow"">https://status.heroku.com/uptime</a> - no service is perfect, but that&#x27;s not once every couple of years<p>Heroku can look like a bad deal for all sorts of reasons, not least of which cost, and it is not comparable to hiring your own sysadmin, more like having a freelance sysadmin on call who is also responsible for thousands of other sites which are liable to be down at the same time. If you are medium/high traffic website with few other tech costs, heroku can be very expensive compared to the alternatives. Additionally, as documented by some of their customers, they are an extra level of indirection between your app and the user and that make troubleshooting issues or optimising harder -<p><a href=""http://news.genius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-annotated"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.genius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-anno...</a><p>I would disagree anyway though that Docker (in its current form) is going go to kill services like heroku, because it requires significant expertise and setup time to get right, and doesn&#x27;t fully address the same concerns.",1411728852

You can think in terms of it being a Dirichlet (fixed but flexible) vs. Cauchy (fixed and unflexible) boundary condition.

In an abstract sense, it&#x27;s obviously true that any listener is going to have a listener-relationship with a podcast. But beyond the most abstract of senses I suppose it entails things like loyalty to a certain show.<p>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nonsense. Podcasting is -- not per se, but currently and for the most part -- a serial, subscription medium. The loyalty is currently built in, because like a newspaper or magazine, you subscribe to it and get it delivered -- often directly to your ears, without further interaction. Loyalties are much more fleeting for other kinds of online content delivery. (Some YouTube and streaming channels are an exception and the same is true for them. They&#x27;re a very similar medium.)<p>Beyond mere loyalty, many podcasts I listen to feature recurring speakers, and are very focused on pure voice content, with no music, no audio clips, etc. You basically listen to the same people talk for hours. I also subscribe to a couple of radio news programs that don&#x27;t do this to the same degree. At this point I&#x27;m very used to Marc Maron&#x27;s entire way of speaking (on his podcast, obviously I can&#x27;t know how he talks in real life).

E.g. I dig up some resource, and rather than consuming it I invest it in building some device that increases my ability to dig up resources in future. Wealth comes from productivity improvements.<p>Developed countries are wealthier because it takes a tiny fraction of human effort to produce e.g. a car or a loaf of bread compared to in a developed country, because through investing in technology/capital we&#x27;re much more productive at making cars and bread.",1411726115

Engineers cost more than line cooks or lawn mowers. Can you think of a software company that reached $1.5 mil in year two?<p>2) While running this small business, in the Valley you&#x27;re competing with rocketships, which are Square and Uber at the moment. A rational engineer considering your company versus one of the rocketships is going to sense there&#x27;s more upside for him at a rocketship company than a company with small business vision.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there&#x27;s a bunch of software-based small businesses (consulting shops, hosting companies, Web design firms) that are successful, but employees know that very rarely anybody outside the founding team will hit it big money-wise.",1411725726

To add to cygx&#x27;s point, a quick break even sum:<p>A 60W equivalent costs around $1.50, and using ~12W of energy. Even if we use the lowest electricity cost for the US ($0.08/kWh), and assume the incandescent bulb was free:<p>cost of bulb  / power difference * cost per Wh = break even time<p>1.50 / (60-12) * (0.08 / 1000) = 390 hours<p>So you only need to use a bulb for 390h to recover the total purchase cost. You can argue all you want about lifetimes, equivalence etc, but these are not marginal figures, especially when you factor in that real EU electricity prices tend to be 2-5x the figures I used-- with German or Danish electricity you&#x27;ll have pay back times well under 100h.<p>Those like you and ekianjo make a good case for regulation.

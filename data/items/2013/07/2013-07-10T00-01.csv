There aren&#x27;t a lot of games or Instagram apps written in JS, what there are, are lots of content oriented and form processing based mobile web sites, like your Bank, or your insurance company, or Slate or HuffingtonPost, and it is these sites which are prompting you to download native versions, and it is people&#x27;s experience of these lightweight (non-CPU dependent) sites as being slow which I think needs addressing.<p>I would break it down into three effects:
1) startup latency<p>2) excessive repaints/not leveraging compositor/jank<p>3) &#x27;uncanny valley&#x27; issues where web emulations of native widgets don&#x27;t match 100% with the feel of system widgets.<p>The basic documented-oriented part of the mobile web is a lot slower than something like UIKit/TextKit in iOS, so the time to launch even a basic form to display some data, or a few paragraphs, and smoothly scroll it, with all rendering effects, and without layout or repaint jank, is just more work on the mobile web to optimize for, and therefore, many developers don&#x27;t do it, or aren&#x27;t aware of how to do it, leading to enduser perception that &quot;mobile web is slow&quot;<p>I&#x27;d summarize my point of view as: NaCl/PNaCL won&#x27;t solve our problems (although it is still a good idea to do them)",1373417747

Look at Pokemon, for example: in western markets, it was seen as a &quot;you mean I have to buy two versions to 100% the game!?&quot; cash-grab; in Japan--which is much denser, geographically--you were actually reasonably likely to have <i>multiple</i> people to trade with for <i>any</i> game with such features.<p>To put it another way: Nintendo basically expects people to want to play with their &quot;real friends&quot; over the net--as an extension of their older &quot;sit around a console in the living room together&quot; dynamic--and sees no benefit in letting people play with/against strangers. They assume that if a kid wants badly to find someone to play a game with, they&#x27;ll go and find someone in the real world, convince them [to convince their parents] to buy the game, and play it with them. This also, as a side-benefit (from Nintendo&#x27;s perspective), shunts the work of &quot;moderation&quot; in these games to the parents: deciding whether to let your child hang around with some other child is already a well-established thing that parents do, and making it a prerequisite to establishing a game-play link means that parents can&#x27;t complain to Nintendo for exposing their children to &quot;the wrong sorts&quot;--the responsibility was effectively passed back to them.",1373417714

At least in the case of larger classes, an experienced professor has enough different exams and papers to grade so he can get a good statistical distribution, determine who earned what grade, and assign based on some predetermined center and max/min.<p>So, for example, a 98-100% might mean &quot;top student in the class that year&quot;, a 55% might mean &quot;lowest scoring student who deserved to pass the class&quot;, and 75% might mean &quot;right on the average that year&quot;. (YMMV, these numbers are illustrative and different colleges and programs will have their own conventions).<p>The <i>&quot;actual&quot;</i> or unadjusted scores might be quite different with no curve - for example, in the freshman calculus class I took, correctly answering 4 problems out of 10 on the exam was enough to earn a grade among the top few students of the year and a curved grade in the 90s, even if the &quot;raw&quot; score might be something like 35-37%.",1373416424

Also, in terms of use, maybe has another major advantage over null.

Say you have a Java class with five fields, three of them are nullable (i.e. have a sensible notion of being null) and two are not (have to be non-null unless there is a programming error). There are tons of places where you can mess up: assign null to an invalid variable, assign &quot;x = f()&quot; not noticing f can return null, call &quot;y.f()&quot; forgetting that y can be null etc. However, if your type system handles nullability, you will get a compile-time error on each of them. More: if you change nullability of a field, compiler errors will point out places that have to be changed.<p>By throwing an exception when you &quot;know&quot; an element in the hashmap has to be there, you resign from safety offered by the compiler.

I would still argue that Valve, as a company, should not have strung her project along if they were not really interested in committing to AR. The problem I see here is that they brought on people to do hardware projects, and then resisted making any compromises that might be required to see the project to completion. Its easy to understand why said employees would be bitter in such a case, and I would say that there should have been some more introspection on whether they were really committed to the project or not. The one-sided story we&#x27;re getting indicates that the introspection never occurred and it was brushed off as the employee&#x27;s problem when it really was Valve&#x27;s.<p>Edit: That being said, the resolution of the situation was impressive.

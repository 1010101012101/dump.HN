(And thanks for pointing it out. If my needs get fancier, I might well decide to use it.)<p>But, for the moment, we ARE talking about simplicity. I'd like to simply encrypt a plaintext file. Then I'd have a decrypting version of cat (call it ""dcat"") that asks me for a password, doesn't echo it, and applies it to the file before cat'ing. It doesn't know if the password is right or wrong; it just passes the file through it before cat'ing. If I give it the wrong password, gibberish comes out.<p>I could then view a whole file (dcat my_secret_pancake_recipe.txt) or pipe it to grep (dcat my_logins.txt | grep -A 2 Netflix) to get just the lines I want---exactly what you'd do with any text file except that it starts with a decryption that asks for a password (which it doesn't echo).<p>What's the best way to do something this simple?<p>UPDATE: openssl essentially does this and comes already installed on Mac OS X.

4493628,comment,4493302,4493504,7,0,derleth,,,"You can achieve the some of the same results with less -R and you also get searching and scrolling. (It colorizes ls's output, but it doesn't do the scrolling or screen-clearing stuff.)<p>To get a handle on <i>why</i> this happens, think of it this way: Back in 1983 using Unix (and I mean a full-size Serious Unix, not Xenix for the 8088 or anything) meant hooking a text terminal (like the brand-new VT-220!) to a minicomputer (like a PDP-11 or a VAX) over a serial line, possibly also involving a modem.<p>Now you only have one communication channel between your text terminal and the computer. That's a bidirectional link that ships characters at, say, 120 characters per second, a good speed for the time. Given that there is only one channel to work with, if you want to make some text underlined, for example, you have to tell the terminal to do it using in-band signalling. The VT-220 has a complex set of such commands, or control codes, prefixed with the ESC character (0x1b in ASCII). In-band means everything is done using the same line, so there is fundamentally no difference between the characters in the ""Hello, world!"" your application prints and the control codes that make some of ls's output bold.<p>And that's it: If an application sends a sequence of characters that's a control code recognized by the terminal, the terminal will interpret it and do something special, like make the following text yellow-on-red and blinking. (The VT-220 might not have been able to do color, but other terminals could, including terminal emulation software for the IBM PC, say.)<p>The catch is, there was very little standardization about what control codes did what. ANSI tried to standardize, and was successful to the extent the popular VT-100 family followed the standard at least partway, but it was too complex a standard to succeed completely. These days, of course, pretty much everyone uses xterms and they're pretty close to the ANSI standard as well. On the other hand, back when ADM-3As and Wyse 60s roamed the Earth, just about all you could assume was that all of the printable ASCII characters (plus space) would make the appropriate characters on the screen and that CR (0x0d) would be a carriage return.<p>That lack of standardization is why termcap and terminfo exist: They map 'what the terminal can do' with 'how to do it' in terms of control codes. It's also why curses and ncurses were written (as APIs to abstract 'what' from 'how'), and why terminal handling code has largely been done via an API of some kind for the past three decades or so. ncurses is like Xlib for text terminals, right down to the network transparency.<p>Here's an interesting article on modem speeds because it's Saturday: <a href=""http://www.textfiles.com/computers/bitsbaud.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.textfiles.com/computers/bitsbaud.txt</a><p>Here's a page where you can download massive termcap and terminfo files, if you ever need to know how to make an ADM-3A clear its screen: <a href=""http://www.catb.org/terminfo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/terminfo/</a>",1347129934

people with increasingly lower amounts of technical acumen. At one
point, ""on the system"" was understood to mean something is stored on the
time-sharing mainframe, simply because everyone used dumb terminals to
access the infamous ""system"". As technology progressed and computers
became smaller, more affordable, and more capable, the lingo changed to
""on the server"" since you actually had the capacity to store something
on your ""system"". The odd part is we still expected the ""server"" to be
located locally (in building, on campus, &c.), When a server wasn't
located (implied) ""locally"", it was called an ""off site"" server and was
typically accessed over private, dedicated lines/connections. This lingo
survived for a while when access methods changed to using connections
over the public Internet -- TYPICALLY DRAWN AS A CLOUD IN DIAGRAMS!<p>Some marketing person who didn't really understand technical diagrams of
networks saw the amorphous ""cloud"" representing the Internet in the
drawings and started referring to ""the Internet"" as ""the cloud.""
Needless to say, this lingo caught on with the non-technical folks, and
has been used ever since. I sincerely doubt we'll get rid of the phrase
any time soon since the majority of people on this planet are
non-technical and they tend to use the simple ""hype"" names they have
leaned.<p>The most interesting bit to all this linguistic history is you can
accurately profile people with it. For example, ""Did he capitalize

The explicit self, as currently implemented, carries no information: yes, you get to pick ""self"" as the instance name, but <i>everyone</i> picks ""self"" for that and There's One Way To Do It in Python anyway.  If you could declare a class method like this:<p><pre><code>    class Foo(object):
      def class_method(Foo):
        pass
</code></pre>
then suddenly explicit self gains a meaning (Hey! Instance method!) and class method declaration doesn't go through a completely unrelated mechanism.<p>>>  methods only become class methods when a decorator is used<p>> That's because the decorator is basically a flag to tell the attribute-resolution process to handle this method differently from the normal method-resolution process.<p>Do you see how that's just special-casing method declaration in a similar way to Ruby's mechanism, just relying on the programmer to drive the mechanism himself?  To a not-so-casual observer it looks like Guido wasn't willing or able to change enough semantics to make a syntactic fix work for class method declaration, despite there being an obvious space in the syntax for it to fit in, so lent on a convenient implementation detail - a hack - to get the same effect with more work for the programmer.<p>Of course, it's equally possible that he believes that class methods are a code smell and should be explicitly made ugly, which I could have a certain sympathy for, but to me the current situation just looks really inelegant.",1347128630

You'll want them to have similar keys, so they don't clash when you hear them (my mashup suffers from this in a few places), which can be tough, and pitch-shifting won't necessarily get you there. You also have to beat match everything, which means adjusting the tempos of the a capellas so they match your music track. Easiest way to do this is to find a BPM tapper and tap out the BPM for your song and your a capella, and plug those numbers into your DAW's tempo changer. If it's not perfect, you'll just have to slice the track during gaps so that major vocal cues land on specific beats.<p>After that, you just have to sequence everything together so it sounds good. In a mashup, this means making the lyrics and the music mesh well, and having hooks that throw your audience off guard. For example, in my mashup, my favorite part is the transition into the Offspring song because it just flows so well (""uno dos tres quatro cinco cinco seis"" ""let's go"" ""you know it's kind of..."") and it's unexpected. Balance the lyrics so that one thing is being said/sung at a time.<p>Overall, just make it fun. A mashup is supposed to be a unique spin on other songs.

to accurately predict the stagnation and decline of complex systems, or
more accurately, growth-decay cycles. It's a bit like knowing the sun
regularly rises somewhere over there (<i>jcr points vaguely towards the
""East-ish"" direction</i>) but having no idea <i>why</i> it does, and hence,
having no way to accurately predict where it will rise. Trying to figure
it out can be both fascinating and frustrating.<p>There was a mathematician or scientist who said, ""To measure something
is to know it,"" but unfortunately, I can't remember his name. Anyhow, I
agree our inability to accurately measure and model (or even notice) a
lot of the factors involved in complex systems results in our inability
to describe or predict them.<p>BTW, I kind of look at ""measuring value"" and ""modeling ways to screw up
the network"" to be mostly the same thing. In one case you're
identifying, measuring, and modeling the beneficial (value-increasing)
factors, and in other, you're identifying, measuring, and modeling the
harmful (value-decreasing) factors. --I have a funny feeling that I've
missed some thing obvious, so did I misunderstand your statement?",1347127670

I mean, people that will lose thousands of dollars every minute you are down have... rather different hosting expectations from people that are making a thousand dollars a month.<p>I mean, which would you rather have, assuming they were paying you the same money (and using the same capital resources, e.g. both of them use a full low-power dedicated server that costs $1,200 up front in parts and $20/month in power.  Both use about as much bandwidth.)<p>Customer A. who is hosting email, web and ftp for his family, and maybe has a dev setup so she can test out the new webapp she's developing.<p>or<p>Customer B. who is running a website with $10,000 per day worth of sales.<p>Assuming they both have my phone number and can wake me up at 4am and yell at me, I can tell you that I am going to want a lot more money to give customer B the same service as customer A, because first, customer A isn't going to call me at 4am very often, and if I do flub something up, I can give customer A a free month, an apology and an explanation of what happened, and she is going to think I'm okay.<p>Customer B?  man, customer B is going to wake me up every time there is even a little networking blip.  And if I screw it up?  they are going to have reason to be really angry, and possibly sue me for a bunch of money.  a free month is unlikely to mollify them.<p>(also note, insurance might cover the payout if I get sued, but they certainly won't cover the time and aggravation, even in the best case.)<p>So yeah, I can see how hosting customer B would be exciting, but I'd want a whole hell of a lot more money to deal with those increased expectations.<p>If we want to go to the car wash example, when I was driving my maxima with unrepaired body damage?  my neighbour caved in the rear passenger door with her land rover.  ""Don't worry about it,"" I said, ""You did not significantly lower the utility or value of my car.""   -  I mean, the whole thing was probably worth about as much as the bumper on her land rover.<p>If she had done the same to the new M3 in the next space over?  you can bet her insurance would be making it just perfect, for a price that could have bought my jalopy several times over.<p>That's the thing.  Nobody reads the legal bullshit until the knives are fully out and the lawyers are at the table.  When you think about it, it doesn't make sense to spend the effort until then.  I mean, you're talking about thousands of dollars of effort to understand a contract, and that doesn't make any sense on a contract that is worth two hundred bucks.  Setting expectations is an important part of avoiding the situation where the lawyers need to come out and understand the contracts.<p>(Of course, this is why most contracts are as one sided as legally possible;  there is no advantage to giving quarter, as the counterparty won't really read it until the relationship has soured and they are actively hostile.)",1347127547

4493516,comment,4492899,4492899,1,0,16s,,,"I would say that Python has a feeling of inconsistency at times compared to other scripting languages. I don't mean this as a criticism. I like and use Python a lot for work and personal projects. Here's an example of what I mean by inconsistent:<p><i></i><i>len(a_string)</i><i></i><p><i></i><i>a_string.lower()</i><i></i><p><i></i><i>a_string.upper()</i><i></i><p>So here, there's a global, generic function len() that returns the length of the string while in the other examples, the string has methods such as .lower() .upper() etc. Why not have a_string.length()? I understand that generic functions are more efficient and even proper in OO. It just causes the feeling of inconsistency when you use the language a lot or when you are teaching a child how to program and have to explain the difference and why some things are methods while others are not.<p>Also, some python idioms (such as slicing) are not intuitive for many use cases. Here's an example of the traditional way in which to reverse a string in Python by slicing:<p><i></i><i>a_string[::-1]</i><i></i><p>In Ruby, you type <i></i><i>a_string.reverse()</i><i></i> and that is much more intuitive to a child when compared to the slicing in Python.<p>Having said all of that, I love Python and use it daily and encourage others to do so as well.

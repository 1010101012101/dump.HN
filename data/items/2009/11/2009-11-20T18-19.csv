At that time the trojan sends me all your personal information. There is no way Apple's drones will be able to find this.<p>And yes, before you say that maybe the App reviewers change systems clock etc., I'm can be more creative to fool that too.

  Can you also email Gene and get him to do the same? I

952952,comment,952745,952745,0,0,sofal,,,"Typing is an asset for those who use a command line interface as well. It's more than just a simple reduction of latency. If you are a slow typist, it's likely that your horizon of possibilities for leveraging the power of quick and easy shell commands is so small that you'd be better off using a mouse and an IDE.<p>If you've ever witnessed an extremely fast command line whiz in action, you realize just how effective of a weapon their typing speed is. When the latency between knowing what you want to do and getting it done disappears, the depth at which you search a tree of possible commands and experiments increases.<p>In coding there are situations in which typing fast lets you experiment faster. For example, when you're trying to narrow down a bug to a few different possibilities, if you can type fast then you can quickly open up a new window and code up a little test application that isolates the problem. The thinking/typing ratio of these kinds of debugging experiments is low, and it has been my experience that most people are loathe to go and actually code up an <i>entirely different program</i> to do a quick test, simply because they don't want to do the typing.<p>In a nutshell, being able to type fast can remove mental barriers and change your approach to programming. Just look at how your approach to using a computer or browsing the Web changes when latency is reduced. Just because your CPU is idle 97% of the time doesn't mean that CPU speed is not important. Just because you spend more time reading a web page than loading it doesn't mean that latency isn't important.",1258741945

952910,comment,952745,952745,0,0,hy3lxs,,,"Agreed; if you're truly horrible at typing, then you're probably not a good programmer. I did some pair programming with several of my interview candidates and here's what I saw.<p>(1) There's something important you can tell about a person's relationship to computers just by watching them type. The <i>terrible</i> typists were also the worst programmers. How can I take you seriously if you aren't comfortable at the keyboard? I can't believe that somebody who loves to code hasn't spent enough hours at a computer to figure out how where all the keys are, even if they aren't touch typists. Several observations: (a) staring down at the keyboard instead of having eyes on screen results in typos missed until several characters later, requiring extra navigation time, or simply missed until the compiler yells at you, if you've even got a compiler to save you; (b) programming makes use of a lot of symbolic characters, so people who can't even find alphabetic characters on the keyboard are even worse writing code. The most frustrating typist I encountered would occasionally hold down enter instead of shift for several seconds while hunting for '(', only to look up several seconds later and notice they had inserted a huge amount of blank space in the file, followed by a '9'. Did not hire.<p>(2) Once above a certain minimal threshold of typing competence, there didn't seem to be much correlation between typing skill and programming skill. The person we ended up hiring was also (gently) asked to take an online typing course. Their speed quickly increased from a two-finger 30 wpm to full touch-typing 60 wpm. A noticeable increase in productivity was also observable just by watching them type, especially as typo corrections happened quickly with eyes focused on the insertion point and not on the keyboard. Once you have in mind the code you want to write, then your fingers and text editor can either get out of the way or be a limiting factor.<p>From a cognitive standpoint: if you're a great programmer but a horrible typist, then how can you not want to increase the data transfer bandwidth between your mind and the editor?",1258740757

When you start making energy even more expensive, the economics are going to shift for the remaining factories and we're going to ship pretty much every one left in this country to somewhere they don't have cap and trade. That is going to cost a lot of blue collar jobs.<p>Then food will be significantly more expensive because of the increased energy costs - and not to mention they produce a lot of CO2. Who gets hit most by the cost of food? Those at the bottom or those at the top?<p>Everything about this is really really regressive. You are willing to ""make sacrifices now"", because frankly you don't have to make any sacrifices. ""I'm willing to pay more tax"". Wow, what a sacrifice. Might have to pass up on the next iPhone. Taxes take away discretionary income from the upper classes. Big deal. Regressionary laws that destroy blue collar jobs and make the cost of living higher for those at the bottom cause real, true, heartbreaking hardship. Get off Hacker News and go into an area like Detroit that has been hit by these problems and see what I mean. If you can't afford food and can't afford your rent and lost your job and are trying to raise kids, those are more than just little sacrifices. Honestly that is way worse than the alternative. What is going to happen if climate change comes? Sea levels will rise and some houses will be lost in most areas on the coast, and cities will have to have levies built. Is that better or worse than destroying the lives of millions of people today?<p>Not to mention, if you pass cap and trade you won't actually do a damn thing to help the climate. Every factory that moves offshore will be going somewhere they don't enforce these kind of laws. In fact a lot of countries you offshore to have incentives to reduce automation and increase job supply, so something that might take 1 guy here takes 4 there. Generally that is related to reduced automation and reduced technology. Which is also related to lower efficiency and higher emissions. The power plants in the US are a heck of a lot cleaner than the equivalent in a lot of the countries we are outsourcing to. And then you have the transportation emissions getting it here.<p>So you are talking about definitely hurting a lot of people today, and hoping that just maybe you might be able to make tomorrow better than it could turn out to be if these computer models are correct, or it might make tomorrow just as bad or worse if compliance isn't 100% globally - which it won't be.",1258740630

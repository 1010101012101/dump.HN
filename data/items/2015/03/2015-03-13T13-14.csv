9197091,comment,9196231,9196786,0,0,tomp,,,"But as soon as you generalize the situation, the objection is much less relevant.<p>Assange is obviously not trying to evade justice, or &quot;on the run&quot;. He reported to the Swedish authorities when he was first accused and wanted for questioning and then only left Sweden after they allowed him to. When he was in house arrest in the UK, he was reporting to the police every week and was being totally cooperative with the authorities. He has also repeatedly suggested that the questioning be done over Skype or by having the prosecutor visit him in the UK, which is standard practice for crimes of similar graveness in Sweden. Only after he was supposed to be extradited did he become a &quot;fugitive&quot; and hid in the embassy.<p>Furthermore, the women that could be the victims don&#x27;t even want him to be persecuted, although the situation here is not clear-cut, as they could just say that to escape some retributive online justice, and since rape and similar crimes are considered crimes against the state and are persecuted by the state regardless of whether the victim wants that or not.<p>In a generalized rape or another similar crime, you would probably have a crime that is more obvious and has more proof, a victim that wants justice, and a criminal that is actively avoiding justice from the very beginning. You have none of that here.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t know if that applies to all crimes or just to rape, but I find it rather funny that he cannot by persecuted &quot;in absentia&quot;.",1426255183

9197083,comment,9193521,9194237,0,0,thechao,,,"> Many years ago, I briefly worked at NVIDIA on the DirectX driver team (internship).<p>I&#x27;ve been a full-time GPU engineer at a couple of major companies for about 6 years now. My colleagues at my current company have all been GPU engineers (and video, prior to that) in the 20--30 year range.<p>While a lot of the technical details are correct, there are a lot of red-flags in this guy&#x27;s essay. For instance:<p>> Although AMD and NV have the resources to do it, the smaller IHVs (Intel, PowerVR, Qualcomm, etc)<p>Intel owns, what? 60? 70 percent of the desktop market? More? PVR, Qualcomm, etc. own 90% of the mobile market? Intel has an enormous number of GPU engineers---far more than AMD, and easily comparable to (or more than) NV.<p>Now, to OP&#x27;s statement about DX12 & Metal: <i>obviously</i> they were developed cojointly with AAA game developers. The major title developers are in <i>constant</i> contact with every major IHV and OS vendor (less so for open-source) at all stages with respect to driver- and API- development.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s not like the major architects and engineers of these driver teams are total tools; these guys live and breathe GPU architecture (and uarch), and are intimately familiar with what <i>would</i> make a good driver.<p>The impetus for these low level APIs is differentiation and performance. When those couldn&#x27;t be had from GPU HW, the next place to look is &quot;one up the stack&quot;: driver & API. It surprised <i>no one</i> in the industry that Mantle/Vulkan/Metal/DX12 all came out at about the same time: we&#x27;ve all been pushing for this for years.",1426255107

9197062,comment,9196467,9196788,0,0,gsb,,,"Relating to #3, if you expect to be overseas long term and you are in a situation where foreign tax credit will cover your US tax liability, it can be advantageous to use the foreign tax credit instead of the FEIE even if your income is less than the ~100k FEIE limit.  This is because the unused credit can be rolled forward and used as a buffer for cases where you do something tax-advantaged in your country of residence which is not honoured by the IRS.  Most commonly this could be capital gains on the sale of a primary residence which is tax-free in many countries but only partially so in the US.  But there are many other such possibilities, like retirement savings not covered by totalization agreements, special treatment for redundancy payouts, lump sum retirement payments, etc. There is this general idea that tax agreements eliminate double taxation, but they only do so imperfectly because the legislation is tailored for people temporarily working overseas, not people who make their home overseas.<p>These cases are perhaps not relevant to the typical digital nomad when they set out, but things happen and you may choose not to return to the US.  In those cases, it is good to have chosen to file your taxes in a way that maximises future choices.<p>In my view the FEIE should only be used if you KNOW you will go back to the US soon and want the easier filing it provides, or if your foreign tax credit is simply not enough.",1426254791

If that&#x27;s the case, how do people not get charged with rape all the time?<p>Girl gets drunk, wakes up the morning after, looks over and would rather chew her own arm off than wake him up before escaping...<p>This kind of scenario has played out in countless movies and every university dorm since the beginning of time. Usually it&#x27;s the guy who gets drunk and tries to escape, but the plot is the same.<p>So he woke her up with sex... something many millions of partners the world over have done countless times... and enjoyed. She appeared willing, consensual, into it - at least that&#x27;s how it allegedly looked at the time, and then she cries foul after the fact...<p>Sounds an awful lot like she had sex with this guy, then she was jealous about him having sex with another girl, they both found out he was double dipping (as it were), were pissed that they weren&#x27;t the center of his attention and thus decided to have him slapped with a rape charge.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s just what one can glean from the various hyperbolic media reports. I&#x27;m quite sure it&#x27;s more nuanced than that. But even with the hyperbole, that doesn&#x27;t sound like rape, that sounds like a revenge tactic for jealousy. The fact that this could also play favour for a U.S. rendition really just compounds how suspicious this whole situation sounds.<p>If you were in the shoes of Assange, with 2 girls throwing themselves at you for sex (which is how it comes across in the media) and then in the midst of you leaking the largest trove of politically embarrassing documents that have ever been leaked, having them come forward with allegations of rape, in a country that until you start digging you had no idea they have a history of conspiracy to perform illegal rendition to the U.S...<p>It seems to me that the worst thing that happened here was poor judgment.

The motivation of hospital administration comes down to a bunch of numbers on paper.  If you can _prove_ that they will have _significant_ gains by implementing one of these standards they will move.  However, most of them have been around long enough to see the standards come and go and are aware that HL7v2 is still in use 99% of the time.  To them it is truly a case of, &quot;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t waste the money fixing it.&quot;  My hope is that FHIR and its approach to solving the problem of a bloated unwieldy standard with extensions will gain ground.  If hospital administrations can be convinced to implement a simpler and cheaper standard to start, which has the potential for extension in the long-term. It will go over far better than the current approach of, &quot;We&#x27;ll implement this new standard for you that will take nearly 2 years, cause budget overruns, and never really see adoption.&quot;  (The only people that end up benefiting are the consultants implementing the spec.)<p>Additionally, there&#x27;s still an emotional component of &quot;You&#x27;re not getting our data because we don&#x27;t trust you know how to secure it properly.&quot;  From the personal experience of having worked with the IT staff at various medical institutions there is often a level of paranoia around their data.  Which, in some regards is fully justified given the regulations (HIPPA, HITECH, etc) they are required to meet.  The issue is that it often moves beyond meeting the regulations into a place of attempting to exceed the regulations.  Which, seems like a smart move until it is too late and you&#x27;ve only succeeded in adding extra bureaucracy into your internal processes.  These added burdens are then foisted upon external parties who are attempting to integrate with the system and therefore, by the nature of the regulations, the processes which have been previously set forth by the implementing institution.<p>All of that said, I agree with your statement, &quot;I know people on HN have fire in their breast to change the world but the rock is harder to move then many think.&quot;.  However my take is that we are attempting to move the wrong rock.  Healthcare institutions need to learn the correct way to introduce and enforce secure yet flexible processes and policies in regards to technology.  After that occurs then the technology rock will be much easier to move.<p>I&#x27;m going to add that I&#x27;ve been a Medical Software Engineer for just shy of 10 years and it has been both an extremely frustrating and also extremely rewarding ride.",1426254194

The plot is extremely predictable from its beginning to its end, it felt like a collection of the most popular cyberpunk tropes.

9196956,comment,9196467,9196467,0,0,kephra,,,"> If I had an accountant I wouldn&#x27;t be searching for this info!<p>Most accountants only know B&M, M&D, and SBOs. Accountants who know international tax laws, are seldom seen in the wild, but mostly employed as specialist in big companies.<p>In Germany tax office is required to answer every question. They wont tell you how to reduce your taxes, so you need to ask the right questions. But you have a signed paper afterwards, that you can show, if your books are checked 10 years later, telling that a tax officer claimed you did it right.<p>I can only tell the other way round:<p>If you are a German, and have an LLC in Tennessee, then this LLC is a path through taxed company, so you have to pay US income tax on it. Germany and US has a double tax agreement, so I do not need to pay taxes on the US income, but the US income is added to my German income to calculate the percentage of my Germany income that I have to pay as taxes.<p>Its now a bit more complex for US citizen in Germany. You have to file your US taxes till 15. Juni, if living outside US at IRS Center, Austin, TX, 73301-0215, USA. And your German taxes 10th of Mai. I advise to file the German taxes as early as possible, if self employed. You dont need to worry about this, if you are employed in your own company with payroll tax. Just ensure that your German tax return is ready, before you need to file your US tax. The double tax agreement between US and Germany will cause IRS to look at German taxes, whine and laugh, because German taxes are higher, and tell you that you need not to pay additional taxes in US.<p>My advise is to ask IRS.Frankfurt@irs.gov to confirm this!<p>Coming back to paying low taxes, and getting good health care same time with an US/Germany combi: Regardless if you are German or US citizen, imho the best combination is being employed at your own uGmbH in Germany, for only €1000/month. The uGmbH is not funded and owned by yourself but by your LLC in US that owns the intellectual property of your business. File invoices from your LLC to your uGmbH regulary. Your LLC will have nearly no costs. File US taxes as early, and German as late as possible in this case. So you benefit from low US income taxes, and an incredible low health care and unemployement insurance based on your low German income. Add a PLC in Estonia if you need a tax free money sink.<p>Optimizing Spain/US might be totally different. But you likely will be paying US tax as happy as I do - even if I&#x27;m not a US citizen ;-)",1426252937

(see five flag theory: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_traveler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_traveler</a>) Or if not completely avoiding tax residency, you can at least minimise your exposure for the taxes you do need to pay.<p>Also, tax and healthcare mostly have nothing to do with each other...

You can be resident in a country for tax purposes, but still not be eligible for Heath care or other social services...<p>Hope that helps somewhat.",1426252935

I&#x27;m talking third major version mature. My biggest pain point in using an ORM isn&#x27;t a lack of features, but the inability to easily drop-down a level, and skip the abstraction in order to get something unique done.<p>Entity Framework has been around a long time, and is the standard in the .NET world, probably in the same way ActiveRecord is for Rails. EF not only provides well thought out and proven abstractions, but also makes it easy to just write a complex SQL query when necessary. Bookshelf.JS lacks that maturity. It was helpful at the prototyping stage, but has gotten in the way as things became more complex.<p>Unless there is a clear best practice for your stack, I would stick with a simple library to build parameterized SQL queries (we use Knex for NodeJS), and build a data access layer. If you layer and abstract things well, you can always start with an ORM and move away from it if/when it gets in the way.<p>All that said, if you&#x27;re just doing CRUD, an ORM will save you time.

Its been mired in committee for years and makes a ton of compromises. If you look at the demo code, it isn&#x27;t terrible per se[1], but ordering back to the EHR through FHIR is locked into order sets. Order sets for those not in the industry amount to pre set lists of procedure/medication/whatever orders defined on a per hospital basis. Trying to order a specific thing off order set for an individual patient is a be messier.<p>And honestly, the APIs at Allscripts, EPIC, et al are getting a lot better. The APIs avoid a lot of the free text nonsense that floatrock mentioned.

You basically have to treat the remote workers same as a remotely-managed multi-site team, except a site has only 1 worker. You have to worry about any resulting politics and the remote worker(s) getting marginalized and upper management thinking &quot;If they&#x27;re not present they must not be important to the payroll&quot;.

That means more written artifacts about decisions and design.<p>From my own experiences, similar timezones work best. If you&#x27;re in the US and your coworkers 12-13 hour different from you, it&#x27;s going to be difficult if you&#x27;re the only person holding everything together without some working hour modifications from either side.<p>For the technical issues, you need a realtime and asynchronous communication component.

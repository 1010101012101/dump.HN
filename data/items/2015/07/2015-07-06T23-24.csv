Heck, I agree with pretty much everything shkyes said.<p>I didn&#x27;t know labelling Randi Harper a harasser was a gamergate tactic. I know almost nothing about this whole gamergate business. I just visited the OAPI&#x27;s site and recognized the name Randi Harper from my acquaintance&#x27;s experience. He had a very rough time because of her emails, Facebook messages, and tweets. For that reason and that reason alone, I voiced my concern. I don&#x27;t have any other motive.<p>Digging deeper, I see that Harper herself has been on the receiving end of some outright egregious behavior. I can only express my condolences for her and condemnation for her attackers.<p>Still, it seems to me that her organization will likely cause more harm than good in curbing online abuse. One can feel sympathy for another human being while also doubting their fit for a position.<p>But honestly, this whole topic is radioactive.

This is a process that can and does take thousands of years, and if it is happening you are probably not going to expect to see a transformation in morphology (Speciation) during a human lifetime.

9842819,comment,9842692,9842692,0,0,dalke,,,"It&#x27;s a difficult question. Here are other factors to consider.<p>For example, &quot;Time and again, students tell me of three common ways in which most high school and college classes kill their interest in novels&quot;. The author then describes those ways, but doesn&#x27;t describe <i>why</i> there has been an increasing emphasis &quot;now than in those proverbial eras of backwardness, the 1950s and 1980s&quot;.<p>There are at least three that I can think of. The author writes about students who study Russian literature, among others. Those decades were the Cold War, and many Americans studied aspects of the Soviet Union and Russian culture. For example, Condoleezza Rice studied Russian at Moscow State University and her PhD thesis was on military policy and politics in Czechoslovakia. From my own youth, I remember the TV show &quot;Head of the Class&quot;, when it was filmed in Moscow. One of the characters loved Russian short stories.<p>I do not think there&#x27;s the same interest now that the Soviet Union no longer exists, and Russian is not a superpower balancing the US. Thus, the sample population of students has changed.<p>The second thing I can think of is the rise of high stakes testing, which is all that incoming college students have ever experienced. These tests don&#x27;t use novel-length reading passages. From what I gather, students are more tested on the <i>technical</i> aspects of the reading excerpt, rather than the reader’s <i>experience</i> - exactly what this essayist does not want.<p>The third is that the GI bill after WWII opened up college to a lot more people than previously, and until the start of the all-volunteer force in 1973 it offered a way to delay conscription. However, that is only the first 1/2 of &quot;the 1950s and 1980s.&quot;",1436226234

It requires constant maintenance and has to comply with ever-changing FAA rules and regulations. It has to adapt to changing routes and distances -- it might be retrofitted to hold more fuel, or redesigned to burn less. During its lifetime, it will undergo several cabin reconfigurations, and will likely be completely rebranded more than once as it changes ownership. It will live through various versions of seat-back cell phones, overhead entertainment systems, seat-back entertainment systems, WiFi, foot rests, tray tables, and power outlets. And after decades of constant changes, it will be forcibly retired. Like software, it won&#x27;t be retired because it no longer works -- it will just be EOLed because it&#x27;s old, and something newer and shinier has come along.",1436224241

I&#x27;m pretty sure there aren&#x27;t any non-exceptional examples of high school <i>Computer Science</i> courses (e.g., the AP CS course is better described as an Intro to Computer Programming course).<p>And in any case this is a nice exposition.<p>But aside from that, I&#x27;m not sure I see any new insights here about CS/verification, nor any suggestions for research directions that aren&#x27;t already extensively explored. Perhaps I&#x27;m missing something, though.<p>(Edit: There&#x27;s a list of suggested future work at the end of the paper. I guess I get it now; although all of these things have been done in verification/PL -- and even by non-type-theorists -- they almost always involve the development of a new logic, and aren&#x27;t done in pure set theory. So certainly there&#x27;s a lot of work to do if you want to do things in this style. But I&#x27;m still trying to see the benefit of this style, aside from pedagogic or philosophical benefits.

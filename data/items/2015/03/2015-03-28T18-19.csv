Or even go a step further and have browsers manage private keys (client certs) which identify the user? Some Linuxes already do this with SSH: if you have a private SSH key, an SSH agent will remember its decrypted form on first use, and use it for SSH auth.<p>The client certs can be exchanged in a standard format throughout browsers and devices, and mobile phone-based two-factor-authentication can be used to increase security.<p>So - bam, good enough MITM protection (sure, let the banks retain the PKI system), no passwords, and a completely ready implementation requiring no new standards.

do a continuous time, discrete

at all well was just my

I checked (I&#x27;d left for my Ph.D.),

enough that 
one of Fred&#x27;s ideas became the
solution:  At noon, have all the 
planes at distant cities.
Then, in the evening, loaded up, 
all the planes fly to Memphis.
Nearly all the flights are
non-stop -- one plane, one flight,
one city served.  So, net, first

considerations for remote sort

This is the power of &quot;preserving language as reference&quot;: I can look up the meaning and cultural context of &quot;namaste,&quot; gain that information, and then I can use the word &quot;namaste&quot; as a loanword if there&#x27;s not a suitable short word in English that conveys the same idea. That&#x27;s how loanwords happen.<p>Words aren&#x27;t these indivisible blocks that exist in the universe outside of us. When we first learn what, for example, a &quot;fish&quot; is, we don&#x27;t do a lookup in a mental dictionary for the brain-word that means &quot;fish.&quot; We learn that whole paragraph about how fish are animals that swim in water and have gills and fins, etc. Then we come up with a name for that swimmy-water-animal-thing, and move on.<p>If a foreign word or concept is not sufficiently similar to anything readily available in a language, that language grabs the foreign word as a loanword and moves on. That&#x27;s what languages do. This means it&#x27;s valuable to have this as a reference, but perpetual storage -- redundancies and all -- in the brains of generation after generation seems inefficient and burdensome to the brains who actually have to expend effort to store it and also compete in a global society. If they want to, more power to them, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the best mandated investment of resources/time.",1427567698

got a Dassault DA-20 Fanjet Falcon,
popular executive jet, 28,660 pound

turbo jet engines (originally designed
for drones; used in the F-5; but with
an <i>aft-fan</i>), a relatively rugged

some crucial equity funding,
pleased the Board, &quot;Solved the

9282233,comment,9281615,9282179,0,0,shredprez,,,"That makes sense, especially when it comes to production. I&#x27;m curious how the distinction you noted applies to non-physical services? Many services seem to qualify as rent-seeking: you pay a one-time fee to obtain information or a connection others will need and the costs to maintain this information are usually minimal. I assumed selling access to that information would qualify as a form of rent-seeking since information retrieval is incredibly low-cost for whoever owns that information. And it seems like competition, even hypothetically, would never drive such services down toward cost without eradicating the industry entirely. So all info-centric services are built on economic rent. Am I off the mark?<p>Edited to add: The more I think about it, the more it seems all business is really about rent on information: profits are extracted by discovering a cost-effective source and repackaging that information at a higher price to an ignorant market. Innovation as a source of profit seems like rent-seeking on initially exclusive knowledge. Even production is a cascade of information bundled with profit margin and sold to the next party who lacks access you have. The physical product is only the end-game of that information chain. The profit all comes from privileged information, ie charging for something that, once obtained, costs nothing to continue profiting from. Which is economic rent, no? I feel like I must be missing something.<p>Edited once again: Looked into normal profit, which reframes my question slightly: is the phrase &quot;economic rent&quot; used to describe an objective behavior or a behavior relative to the local market (where average profits and opportunity costs vary)?",1427566536

The reviews and comments are useful, the related items and &quot;what people bought&quot; sidebars are handy.<p>By contrast, retailers have lost their edge.  They hire low wage non-specialists, often high school students or other non-professionals who would rather be doing something else for a living.<p>So when you go to a store to purchase a gadget or article of clothing or book, your chief human interaction experience is distressingly often with a bored, under-motivated person who hates his job and hates you too.<p>I treasure the exceptions to the above rule, the dedicated doing-it-for-love guy or gal who really knows their stuff, like the extremely knowledgeable handyman guys and gals at the local hardware store--which is why I still patronize my local Ace whenever I can.  Except they sometimes have a teenager who doesn&#x27;t know where anything is, who doesn&#x27;t scan my frequent buyer card, who can&#x27;t offer me any advice whatsoever, who screws up the price.  That kind of morbidly useless experience drives me (and millions of others) to redirect my money to smart, helpful businesses like Amazon.<p>The way of the world, I suppose.",1382461193

It seems to be a discussion like: Lets work remote but keep everything else the same. Lets keep the company, lets keep bosses, lets collegues, lets keep meetings lets keep the chat at the coffee machine.<p>Working remotely, as I understand it, means, that you have to transform the company employer relationship in a way that it works using rather abstract or technical infrastructure or interface. The company has to know or to learn, and define, what kind of services or deliverable it can expect from its employees. Also the employee has to learn how to present his service or deliverables in a way that they get noticed and impress someone very far away.<p>It is sort of an bidirectional API that both have to serve and use.<p>My question now is, what is the reason for a company to have employees if the service they need is so well defined and could be offered by anyone capeable of serving that API? Why have employes if you can have contractors? The same question holds for the employees, if capable of offering that service in such a well defined way, why not turn into a company themselves and offer that service to anyone willing to pay?",1382461166

We use GitHub for code, Google Docs/Drive for document storage, and email, IM or Google Hangouts for communication - haven&#x27;t found a need for anything else. There is a small office in the company&#x27;s &quot;base city&quot; where a handful of employees work full-time (by choice), but the rest are remote throughout the region.  Most of us are within a 1 to 2 hour drive. We gather at our space once or twice a month to catch up, show off new ideas, and hangout over a few beers - it&#x27;s not a mandate, just whoever can make it. I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a 95% participation rate. We&#x27;ve found it takes the right employee to handle this environment - someone with a lot of drive and accountability. Bad apples shake down pretty quickly. A new hire will drive (or fly) to the office and spend 2 - 3 days in town getting his machine set up, filling out paperwork, training, meeting the rest of the team, etc., then head back out and work from whenever and wherever he/she likes.<p>We have a policy that unless you declare you&#x27;re &quot;out of the office&quot; (i.e., vacation), you should be generally available between the hours of 9-to-5, should someone need to contact you. In practice, though, to avoid being disturbed like that, we&#x27;ve found that we&#x27;ve all become excellent communicators and will set expectations appropriately for our co-workers.

I would compare the &quot;Life Expectancy from Age X&quot; graph for the U.S. against the same graphs for other countries.<p>The article itself notes:
<i>In 2011, the National Institutes of Health issued a report that tried to make sense of it all. Right away, they found our weak spot. &quot;U.S. women have relatively high mortality rates at the younger older ages,&quot; they said, which means when women hit their 55th birthdays, for the next almost 20 years, roughly 55 to 75, they will die more often than women in comparable countries. Americans get more lung disease, more heart disease, more diabetes. If Americans reach 75, they get competitive again, but that early old age is where we lose ground. American men showed pretty much the same weakness at roughly the same times.</i><p>And the NIH study [1] <i>linked</i> in the article actually has the kind of charts that you suggest should be done comparing life expectancy at various ages.<p>It would maybe help if instead of reciting canned arguments based assumptions generated by the <i>title</i>, people would actually read the linked articles.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62373/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62373/</a>",1382458787

Its their way of allowing visitors to get proper wifi access anywhere in the building (plus they trust VPN encryption more than Wifi security).<p>As far as leaking data: anyone with a laptop can leak data.  You should have good IT practices to prevent this type of thing.  All laptops should have their harddisks encrypted and password protected.  Now if the employee is being malicious, a local employee could steal data just as easily (see NSA and Snowden).<p>Good IT practices when you have a lot of computers on your network: (1) don&#x27;t trust any device on your network, so you should have an IDS/IPS for tracking activity.  (2) for VPN people, you want all traffic going through your network, so you can monitor the users network traffic with your IDS/IPS. (3) try to log as much activity as you can in-case you need to do post-mortem analysis once you&#x27;ve been hacked.

Since these common APIs are used by lots of applications, this would ensure the Play Services process never gets booted from memory.<p>It also has the added benefit that applications using push notifications like Gmail don&#x27;t need to maintain a background service because they can rely on Google Play Services to activate them as needed.  Location based apps like Yelp can determine your location more quickly because Google Play Services is constantly monitoring it.  All while reducing the over all memory foot print of applications because they&#x27;re all deferring to Google Play Services.<p>Google can also change their APIs for services, upgrade to new protocols like SPDY, and developers don&#x27;t need to update their applications because Google just needs to maintain the interface to Google Play Services.

6592845,comment,6591412,6591412,9,0,michael_nielsen,,,"A little research (sources at end) shows that the many commenters pointing to vehicular accidents, homicide, infant mortality, and suicide as the &quot;reason&quot; for lower US life expectancy are flat-out wrong:<p>Each year the chance of someone dying in a vehicular accident is about 1 in 10,000 in the US.  Over 80 years that means a citizen has roughly a 1 / 125 chance of dying in a vehicular accident.  The total reduction in life expectancy from vehicular accidents is thus well under 1.0 years.  Assume, for example that such an accident cuts an average of 60 years off a person&#x27;s life -- they would have lived to 80, say, but their life was cut short at just 20 years old.   That works out as a 0.5 year reduction in life expectancy due to accidents.<p>This is without taking into account the vehicular fatality rates in other countries.  When you do that for, e.g., Japan (1 in 20,000 per year), the difference in life expectancy is likely around 0.25 years.<p>The homicide rate in the US is about 1 in 20,000 people per year, or about half the vehicular fatality rate, so perhaps a further 0.25 year reduction, without factoring in homicides in other countries.<p>For infant mortality, the chance of dying at birth is a little over 1 in 200 in the US.  That translates to a reduction in life expectancy of about 0.4 years, without factoring in infant mortality in other countries.<p>A similar analysis shows suicide rates are probably not a factor -- in fact, in some countries, such as Japan, the rate is higher than in the US, while in countries such as the UK it is comparable to the US.<p>So the contributions from all four of these sources is very unlikely to be more than a 1 year difference in life expectancy.  It&#x27;s probably quite a bit less, since I&#x27;ve ignored (e.g.) infant mortality in other countries.  Certainly, the contribution from all four of these is nowhere near the dominant effect to explain differences in life expectancy.<p>A caveat: some people pointing to infant mortality are claiming that what&#x27;s going on is that a large number of stillbirths simply aren&#x27;t being reported in some countries outside the US, and this is skewing the results.  That possibility isn&#x27;t accounted for in my analysis above.  I doubt it&#x27;s true - in my many years living in Canada and Australia I&#x27;ve known quite a few people who died in car accidents, and none of whom had a stillbirth (to my knowledge).  But while this suggests to me that this effect isn&#x27;t large, it&#x27;s of course only anecdotal evidence.<p>Sources for rates:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentiona...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-re...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mor...</a><p>And if you want to look at the details of the suicide statistics:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_ra...</a>",1382458109

Unless you're using it as a simple IFrame embed, it will fall over on xss errors.<p>In Twiddla, for example, we'd like to include a bit of custom script to detect when you click the ""next page"" button so that we can keep everybody synced up.  That means we have to proxy it through our server and mess with the markup a bit.  That's easy to do in Scribd's viewer, and it actually worked fine in Gdocs' view before October last year.<p>Then they changed things & got all fancy.  Shame.",1298123856

2238995,comment,2238872,2238990,0,0,wzdd,,,"Like pascal_cuoq, I was bothered by the apparent lack of rigour here. The problem is a mismatch of expectations. The post is presented like a paper (references, novel algorithm, comparisons, future work), but it isn't a paper. Viewed as a blog post or work-in-progress, it's very cool. Viewed as a paper (which are available on the Web nowadays), it has some misleading statements in it. There is nothing anti-wonder or anti-knowledge about pointing that out.",1298123606

I don't want only to read about studies that are exhaustive, complete, and answer all the questions.  I think there is value in seeing descriptions of algorithms, along with a simple comparison to known algorithms largely for the purpose of understanding the detail and the potential.<p>This is an invitation to explore, not a closed and completed ""job done.""  This is an invitation to Google for other heuristics to enhance my understanding of the field.  This is an invitation to wonder if my unique range of experience and skills might find a better heuristic.<p>Full analysis is the work of a Ph.D. and more.

- issue a public warning to UberMedia & its users and allow 72 hours

It was probably all automatic through content fingerprints.<p>It works like this: Content providers, e.g. Constantin Films, create fingerprints for their catalogue with a fingerprinting service, e.g. Audible Magic. Sites with user generated content e.g. YouTube check any uploaded content 
for a matching fingerprint. If anything gets identified as copyrighted content it gets blocked. I work at a video platform, and this is how we deal with copyrighted content.<p>Usually, this happens during upload, my guess is that YouTube started to use such a service at some point and now cleans their content, which takes some time.<p>I think the parodies are only collateral damage. One more reason to reform copyright.<p><a href=""http://openvideoalliance.org/2010/04/hitler-downfall-meme-gets-dmcad/?l=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openvideoalliance.org/2010/04/hitler-downfall-meme-ge...</a>",1271966329

1286210,comment,1285897,1285897,0,0,sophacles,,,"A big reason I don't do much for python core is that I find it good enough for most of my needs. I do like to contribute to ecosystem stuff tho. Here are reasons I've stopped contributing, or never contributed to some projects:<p>1. They work good enough for me: a big reason for my contributing is me needing it to work a certain way. I have a tendency to whirlwind into a project, dump lots of source, suggestions and whatnot, then not not come back. There is frequently little incentive for me to continue participation. The ones I stick with have a good little community -- this is important. Even solo authors that respond frequently and quickly are community enough for me.<p>2. Non-attribution/recognition -- There are at least 2 projects out there that don't attribute my code, despite it being in the ""trunk"". Another project that factored my code out, took my name off the contributors list. Another never used my code, but took lots of ideas (with email exchanges explaining my intentions with my code), but never recognized my help.  In all of those cases I have moved on. I don't like to complain and won't point fingers here, but it does negatively motivate me. Similarly there are a few projects that I would like to participate in, but am very wary based on individual's connections with the above projects.<p>3. Fear of what I call rabbit-hole-itis.  Sometimes it is safer for me not to delve into the code well enough to make it better, because I will spend a week on it instead of being ""for-real"" productive. This is prolly not fixable as it's about me not the community (of course it wouldn't be a problem if y'all stopped with the neat projects).<p>4. A lot of times it seems like more hassle than it's worth to try and contribute. I think the article hits those on the head  -- mostly the part about ""convincing others my patch actually helps"". It is frustrating to deal with project core devs that don't want to look at your code because of silly reasons that are not technical -- e.g. ""why would you ever need to do that"" or ""it works 'just fine' already"".<p>HTH",1271965050

I doubt this will either.  Its a <i>super</i> clever hack and mighty amusing.  But I'd assume that, much like the FrankenMac's, it'll be too awkward and unstable for most people to even consider using long term.  (I know I gave up on running a frankenmac under VMWare, and all the people I know who were running frankenmac netbooks have gone back running either Windows or Linux on them.  A few of them keep an OSX partition around just to show off that they <i>can</i> do it.  :-) )",1271963193
1286122,comment,1285737,1285965,0,0,andreyf,,,"I wonder that myself. It has something to do with a feeling that people aren't understanding Apple in tech circles, and that we have a lot to learn from them as a company. In this case, I think people are underestimating the damage to Apple from this leak. It's not a coincidence that Steve was CEO of Pixar: Apple doesn't just sell gadgets, but the entire narrative - about the company, about Steve, and about their devices. It's inherent in their secrecy, in their packaging, in their stores, in their presentation, and in the unveiling. Preserving this ""Willy Wonka"" narrative is why they go to such lengths to avoid leaks, not because of some manic control issues.<p>Also, I hate to find myself disagreeing with the ""stream of thought"" around here: for example, I think 3.3.1 is good for startups because it's unenforceable (hence, hackers and founders get to ignore it and get a competitive advantage against risk-averse competitors). Another example: I think one can easily paint Android as evil (Google is clearly developing it at a loss to commoditize complementary markets). It's the equivalent of Microsoft funding extensive open hardware design at a loss. As a heuristic, open is good, but reality isn't that simple: had Microsoft done that, IBM and Intel would never had a reason to invest the billions into chip development they did.<p>I love Google and think they do many great things for the world, but I easily see a different perspective in the case of Android. I can see how what Apple is doing could be about Steve's ego issues, but also about making the best devices possible.",1271963178

Poking at an integer on a querystring and discovering that you can freely change it and get other people's results shouldn't be a crime, misdemeanor, felony, or otherwise. It's so easy that one can literally perform this ""hack"" by accidentally failing to copy and paste the last character of a URL somebody sent to you. If we're going to make that a felony every computer owner might as well just give up and report to the nearest prison forthwith, because you're all but doomed to commit crimes in the course of normal usage.<p>However, scripting that to do it many thousands of times and then collecting the information that results is a qualitative change of behavior. That's not proving a point, or being a responsible security researcher, that's something else.<p>I agree with the rest of his analysis, but a sufficiently large quantitative change can become a qualitative change just by sheer size.",1363917586

In fact, the odds of a given film turning a profit are about 1 in 30. For a detailed examination of the economics of the film industry, I recommend the book <i>Open Wide</i>. For a brief introduction, try this: <a href=""http://www.baselineintel.com/research-wrap?detail/C8/what_are_the_odds_of_making_a_profitable_u.s._indie_film"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.baselineintel.com/research-wrap?detail/C8/what_ar...</a> and other articles on this site.<p>Now, part of this is skewed by the fact that many films are just bad. Not so bad they're good, so bad they're bad - incomprehensible dialog, blurry photography, murky lighting. Let's dismiss 2/3 of films as bad - that's excessive, but let's be harsh. So about 1/10 of the remaining films can make money. Half of those lack commercial elements, they're competent but terribly dull and hard to sell. Of the 5 films you have left that are competently made and have potential commercial appeal, one will sell. There's a <1% chance it will be a hit; more likely it will eventually recoup its costs via foreign sales (as a sweetener in a package) or from rental income via Netflix or the like. That takes about 5 years.<p>That's indie films. Big studio films tend to lose money more often than not as well. I am on first name terms with one billionaire who writes a single check to pay for all the costs of a big famous film you probably saw 4 or 5 times a year (I would prefer not to mention names). 4/5 of those films lose money despite stars, critical acclaim, excellent technical elements, and a great story. Eventually, most of them will break even - that's why you cast stars, you can extrapolate sales with reasonable accuracy once you know the opening data. But the financial destiny of most films is to offset tax liability for the small number of films that do make bank.<p>I own a financial interest in a number of the films I've worked on. I keep the documentation mainly for souvenir value, but I have zero expectation of ever seeing a penny from them. I find it amusing but also frustrating when you roll in here and tell me how profitable it is.",1363917378

But my naive reading of the EEOC Compliance manual, at <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/retal.html#IIpartB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/retal.html#IIpartB</a>:<p>> Public criticism of alleged discrimination may be a reasonable form of opposition.  Courts have protected an employee's right to inform an employer's customers about the employer's alleged discrimination, as well as the right to engage in peaceful picketing to oppose allegedly discriminatory employment practices.<p>suggests that posting those pictures is likely a protected action. If so, then while you may think it's ""unprofessional"", it's not a valid reason for firing someone.<p>(The laws are made even more complicated by a balancing act between what a ""reasonable person"" would expect, the understanding that an employee don't know all of the details of the law, and more factors. Like, Richards's job requires going to conferences, hence PyCon is part of the workplace, but SendGrid doesn't have control over what happens at the conference, so discrimination claims filed to SendGrid are useless.)<p>I'm pretty sure you don't know how the EEOC would handle this case either, since your #2 does not reflect at least my limited understanding of the relevant laws. Protected opposition can include doing things that are ""unprofessional"" and things that cost others money (the EEOC's example is a production slow-down).<p>Also, you brought up an account of how ""she has frequently sidestepped the right channels"", but unless they were related to her job, I suspect that they cannot be used to fire someone. Specifically, Colorado law C.R.S 24-34-402.5 (""Unlawful prohibition of legal activities as a condition of employment"")<p><pre><code>    (1) It shall be a discriminatory or unfair employment practice for an employer to
    terminate the employment of any employee due to that employee's engaging in any
    lawful activity off the premises of the employer during nonworking hours unless
    such a restriction:

      (a) Relates to a bona fide occupational requirement or is reasonably and rationally
      related to the employment activities and responsibilities of a particular employee
      or a particular group of employees, rather than to all employees of the employer; or
      (b) Is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest with any responsibilities to the
      employer or the appearance of such a conflict of interest.
</code></pre>
(SendGrid appears to be a Colorado company, but other states have similar laws. See also the note 'This section applies to lawful, off-duty conduct, even if it is work-related. Insofar as the section refers to ""any lawful activity"", it can be presumed that the general assembly meant all activity without limitation. Accordingly, damages could be awarded to person who was terminated for making a complaint off the premises of the employer during nonworking hours about the safety of a work site. Watson v. Pub. Serv. Co., 207 P.3d 860 (Colo. App. 2008).')<p>Thus, it really does read that if Richards is fired because of any of the reasons you gave in #2, then it's likely an unfair and illegal employment practice, and Richards can sue and win.",1363915565

Doesn't matter if she ""should"" or ""shouldn't"". It happened. OK so far, different people have different opinions on acceptable behavior. This particular one is explicitly unacceptable in the rules of the conference.<p>3) Adria texts PyCon staff, and they act <i>exactly as they did in this sitution.</i><p>4) Adria writes a blog post relaying the event. Basically even starting the same. Her comments even about maybe being frazzled from a rough travel schedule stay in. So do the parts where she decides she's not ok with it and decides it should stop. That is an OK position - I might not feel the same overhearing that conversation, but if she doesn't want to, she should not have to - it is off-topic for the conference (and honestly a freaking repost... forking and dongle jokes were old in the 90s when I first heard them). However instead of going to the hyperbolic bits, where she is saving women from developers[1], she instead writes about how the rules in place helped diffuse an uncomfortable situation, and how there are now two more people who have a better understanding of what is acceptable public behavior in a professional setting.<p>5) There would still be much internet hate. But now everyone involved could maintain jobs, the much needed [2] cause of sane gender policies would be advanced a lot.<p>6) The worst fears of people who are strongly apposed to gender politics would not have been confirmed in the crazy shitstorm, and rather than being a divisive event that caused near everyone (it seems) to polarize, it could have been a great example of meeting in the middle.<p>Unfortunately thats not the story. Instead we have this crazy mess.<p>I think SendGrid wrote the right piece. Under no circumstances is the correct action on their part to comment on a situation they were not present for. Taking sides in that is a terrible move - they need to support their employees rights to respond sanely without taking sides. They should in fact defer to the organizers/governance of the conference when it comes to everything that happened there. The do however have a right and responsibility to make sure their name is not associated with inappropriate behavior. The only inappropriate behavior they are associated with is an overreaction by Adria Richards. That is what they address. End of story.<p>[1] There is a time and place for articles on the scale of ""seriously fuck this creeper"". Unfortunately, those times and places are not uncommon - people act creepy at these conferences a lot. This was not one of them. It was at worst a medium offensive statement.<p>[2] There are a lot of people who oppose the idea of harassment policies. There are a lot of people who cry foul every time a woman mentions anything bad, uncomfortable, or inappropriate that happens around them. This attitude needs to go away, and the opposition to decent policies needs to stop.

Why is it that when a woman does something wrong, the hacker/tech community's first reaction is to throw around gendered slurs? Don't give me this crap about how every other community does it. That's not an excuse. We have to start somewhere, and we should be better than this, but we're not.<p>WRT her not apologizing for posting his photograph: What do you think would happen if she did? She's been fired, she's been threatened with rape and with death, she's been harassed on a constant basis since this began. Do you think her apology will have any effect? Look at how her (rather benign and polite) comment was received: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5399047"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5399047</a> Scroll down and look at all those dead comments. Do you think her coming out now and saying, ""I'm so sorry for publishing your photograph"" would do anything?<p>I'd like to add, where is the lynch mob against these guys that their photograph was supposed to cause? I see a lot of people saying ""you're publicly shaming them!"" and ""you tried to get a witch hunt going!"" but... there wasn't one. She was just posting their photograph, and nothing in the public sphere happened to them. Only one guy was fired, and no one knew about that until he went and made an account on HN himself and said it.",1363914198

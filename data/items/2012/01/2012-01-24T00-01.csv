I've got a backup of it as well.<p>If you have a hard drive full of torrented content or DVD rips that look like torrented content just make 2 TrueCrypt volumes, one that is visible (put some porn on it to simulate a ""this is all I have hidden"" excuse) and the other volume hidden (with all of your pirated content).

Releasing those DVDs doesn't give you <i>that</i> much rights over the still-public-domain content.<p>Look, it's not as if copyright isn't being abused rampantly by all sorts of parties from the top to the bottom, but let's not get stupid about it. There's no copyright doctrine that lets you own the <i>entire idea</i> of a particular list of six movies. Even to the extent you can have a collection copyright [1], that merely limits someone from releasing two DVDs with the exact same movies, if indeed it would even limit that as you'd at least face a bit of a challenge in convincing a judge that meets a minimum creativity bar.

3502911,comment,3502079,3502718,9,0,grellas,,,"Jerf is correct in this. Public domain materials remain so except as modified or improved by the creative work of others and, in that case, only the creative improvements fall under copyright, not the original materials.<p>The recent case of <i>Golan v. Holder</i> held that Congress has the constitutional power to revive the copyright on foreign works that had fallen into the U.S. public domain as part of its treaty-based efforts to promote the arts through reciprocal arrangements with foreign countries. It further held that such ""re-copyrighting"" doesn't violate the first amendment rights of persons who had relied on the prior public domain status of the works that had been removed from public-domain status.<p>The <i>Golan</i> case is, to me, a really absurd outcome and reflects a weird mix of liberals on the Court (e.g., Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who wrote the opinion) upholding sharp encroachments on free speech and conservatives (who joined in a 6-2 ruling) upholding rather large assertions of constitutional legislative power where a strict construction of the constitutional language (""limited times,"" etc.) would seem to point in the opposite direction. I think it is a bad decision. But it by no means empowers any private party to try to claim that anything in the public domain somehow shifts back to copyright status by virtue of what that private party does. The case is irrelevant to that issue.",1327366357

3502893,comment,3502223,3502223,12,0,ZephyrP,,,"""For over a decade prophets have voiced the contention that the organization of a single computer has reached its limits and that truly significant advances can be made only by interconnection of a multiplicity of computers in such a manner as to permit cooperative solution.""<p>This now pithy statement was written by the famous Gene Amdahl in the year 1968; A time when computers ran at speeds that are dwarfed by today's digital clocks, but also it gives us insight into a time when people were still dealing with the same problems that we deal with today in developing faster and faster CPUs.<p>The truth of statement may be something that functionalism or parallelism advocates don't want to hear - the so called Parallelism Revolution will never come, at least not in it's current incarnation.<p>The end of serial advancement, and thus the parallelization revolution was ""supposed"" to happen in the 80s, and despite the considerable advances in methodologies of parallelization, it did not come. The 90s brought us standards and technologies like MPI which standardized procedures in developing cooperative computing solutions, but still, it did not come. The 2000s sought to simplify the very act of programming by reappropriating the ideas of programming back to the realm of pure mathematics - by representing programs as a mathematical description of time and work itself, with languages like Haskell and ML we sought to build machines which model math, and thus, the parallel nature of computation within universe itself.<p>I feel it myself, the sublime glitter of gold that is locked in the idea of parallel computation - It is irresistible for a curious individual. To feel as if all the power of the world is in your hands in this moment (as opposed to 20 years from now), to wipe away the frailty that underlies all of computation today; We all would like to be able to lift a trillion billion bytes into the heavens.<p>Theres only two problems.<p>The first problem lies squarely within our own human inadequacies, and it could be argued that this is where parallelism fails deepest. It is certainly true that parallelization is complex, but like all things, abstractions of complexity are nessasary, and designing the abstractions in such a way they are understandable to 'mere mortals' is a greatly undervalued aspect of technology today. So, I would posit as a result of insufficient desire to establish simplified abstractions of parallelization, to most programmers, ideas like parallelism remains in the domain of machine learning and condensed solids analysis - A kind of electronic black art, only used by those with sufficient training to know what horrors they may wrought upon the world if they're to make some trivial programming mistake. As a result (ceteris paribus!) serial power will always be valued greater than parallel computational capacity, which many have claimed to be the predominant driver of commercial development of scientific ideas.<p>The second problem is more controversial, but I think time will prove it so -- Computer have managed and will continue to manage getting faster at an alarming rate. Regardless of our preconceptions about the mechanics of computation, I believe it is reasonable to say that computers will continue to get faster at exponential rates, even after the so called quantum limits of computation come into play. This is reasonable for the same reason the Normal distribution manifests itself in disparate natural phenomenon - Central Limit Theorem. Sutter himself admits that people have been using the exact same logic to claim the beginning of the end for the past 60-70 years (Before 'real' computers even), I fail to see where he justifies his reasoning after giving this enlightened point.",1327366030

My wife is a recruiter - and I have been both sides of the technical side of the hiring table - so I have a pretty good idea of how it works.<p>I just disagree that refusing to give the first is really either all that effective a tool.<p>First - I think the two best things you can to as a candidate are to (1) do your homework so you're not at a knowledge disadvantage and (2) do the extra work to have several competing offers.<p>With your example, it sounded like the candidate had a solid understanding of what they were worth. What would have really changed if they had simply named their number first? The candidate clearly had confidence in the number (since they walked away from your best offer) It might have saved both of you some time if they had been up-front about it.<p>Anyway - I think I was making two primary points:<p>1) The best way to improve your negotiating position is to do your homework so you have knowledge and options. Knowledge and options will give you <i>way</i> more power in the negotiation than any trick will.<p>2) Negotiating for salary is fundamentally different than other types of business negotiations. A salary negotiation is (hopefully!) the beginning of a lasting relationship. I think it needs to be approached - from both - sides with more focus on ""win-win"" than would be appropriate for other negotiations where a more hard-nosed approach would be appropriate. Personally, I am wary of both potential employers and potential hires that don't approach it this way.<p>Sorry - one last point from talking with my wife...<p>A recruiter is not simply trying to get you in the door at the cheapest salary possible (neither, really, is a good company). There are definitely companies and recruiters that work that way. A good recruiter/employer is trying to get great developers in the door for a salary that will make them <i>happy</i>. A good recruiter/employer will know that having to re-hire someone in a year because they left for a better offer or because you low-balled them at the beginning and didn't adjust is <i>much</i> more expensive in the long run.<p>When negotiating with the recruiter - don't think in terms of convincing the recruiter. Think is terms of given them the ammunition they need to convince the person who will approve the offer. Give them facts, data. information - help them build the narrative that will convince the hiring manager/director/etc that has to approve the offer that they need to hire you for the amount you want.<p>To me, going in with knowledge about what you need and what you are worth and being prepared to help the recruiter sell you to the decision makers is a much better strategy than anything as simple as ""clamming up"" :-)",1327365871

3502887,comment,3502067,3502305,5,0,mdasen,,,"So, I brought up something similar to a third year law student last week.  As he explained it, when the police arrest a drug dealer, the drugs are seized and tested for evidence.  They don't get to keep the drugs, possibly destroy or sell them, etc. while the trial is pending.  Likewise, in this case, the servers are going to be seized as evidence pending trial.<p>He also noted that a grand jury had been impaneled and indicted Megaupload (along with six individuals) and a judge had issued a warrant.<p>So, it wasn't just someone at the FBI or DOJ.  It was a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia that indicted them.  It is being prosecuted by a US Attorney.  More than 20 search warrants were issued in nine countries.  It was investigated by the FBI, the New Zealand Police, Hong Kong Customs, the Public Prosecutor's Office in the Netherlands, London's Metropolitan Police, the German Public Prosecutor, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and others.  Megaupload and the named individuals will have a public trial.<p>I'm not saying that you should like it, but it is different from ""feeling a lot like Russia"".  There's a certain amount of secrecy that happens in a criminal investigation to prevent those being investigated from being able to hide what they're doing (if they're doing something wrong).<p>I definitely had your reaction when I found out that the site was down and they hadn't had a chance to defend themselves.  I think most of us see this as a civil offense - in which case, the seizure might not be justified (I use ""might"" because I'm not a lawyer).  However, if you look at criminal offenses (bank robbery, drugs, gun running, art theft, etc.) you wouldn't expect the accused to keep that property pending trial.<p>We'll see how this plays out.  If you don't believe what they did should be a criminal offense, even if they're ""guilty"" of it, you're not going to agree with any of what the governments are doing.  You're going to think that they should be sued similar to what happened to YouTube and have the chance to defend themselves while operating.  That's an argument to change the law and you won't be satisfied by the process no matter how above board it is.  And I'm not saying that you're wrong - Megaupload does seem a lot more innocuous (even if wrong) than what we generally consider racketeering or conspiracy.  I mean, if Megaupload continued, you're not going to have some kid getting addicted to crack on the street or gangs getting guns and causing violence in the community - some rich media company <i>potentially</i> loses a little profit.  And I think that reality makes a strong argument that maybe seizure wasn't necessary.  However, it's also important to know that there was a lot of due process in a lot of jurisdictions with a lot of different law enforcement working together on this one.  It wasn't just seized because some unanswerable someone in a random agency decided they wanted to.  Likewise, there will be a trial.",1327365833

It would have been more believable and everyone knows that coders love symmetry.<p>Except I just couldn't resist, because... truth is stranger than fiction, and I really <i>have</i> been offered 40% less than my desired salary.<p>(Remember, to a nonprogrammer, programmers look like clerks. When you tell them how much you expect to earn, and they flinch, they may not even be play-acting: Why, for that kind of money they could have hired <i>three</i> clerks! People will generally not hesitate to offer you the median salary for white-collar workers of your age range, either because they're actually clueless or as an opening feint in negotiations; you need to be prepared for that.)<p>Anyway, now that I've led us here, your scenario: You think you can earn $130k. A company opens with an offer of $70k. Do you really counter with $180k?<p>Well, maybe you do! If you're negotiating with an experienced software engineer at a mainstream software company, you could certainly try it. The message you'd be sending is <i>I recognize that you have just thrown me an embarrassing lowball, and I know you know how low that ball was, but I'm going to take it in good faith by assuming it was an obvious joke, and play along by lobbing an obvious highball right back at you.</i> You should probably open with a hearty laugh, though, and make your counteroffer with a sly smile and maybe even a wink.<p>But I, being excessively polite and fairly bad at broad back-slapping humor and pretty much a coward, would probably not do that. Instead I'd play it safe and assume that my counterparty is a babe in the woods - if they've just lowballed you by 45% they're certainly signaling that - and move them up more gently. I'd flinch (<i>Dawson: ""always flinch at the first proposal. Practice flinching. A wince, a cough, a pregnant pause, a slight chuckle, but flinch""</i>) and say something like ""you know, the <i>average</i> starting salary for a Google programmer is far higher than that."" Then talk about that for a while.<p>[EDIT: In my first draft of this I named a number at this point. A number which was <i>lower</i> than my target. A rookie mistake! I really <i>am</i> bad at this. Perhaps it would be better to try and coach them closer to your target number before naming any number of your own.]<p>But it will be hard to salvage a negotiation that starts so low. Give up and take it as a sign: You'll need to start marketing yourself to a higher class of employer, because you've made a mistake. Either you're ridiculously overestimating your earning potential or you're targeting the wrong market with the wrong message. See: patio11's other essay.",1327364922

This was at a huge, very bureaucratic, very political company. This made me the youngest Senior Analyst ever at the company. Here's how I did it:<p><i>Work portion</i>: I focused my work on what provided value, not what was difficult or what was in my job description. One of my big achievements was saving the company roughly $1.2MM with a week of work.<p>I also found out who would be responsible for approving my raise/promotion (my boss and his boss) and what they valued. My boss pretty much just valued results and didn't care how long you worked, where you worked from, etc. But his boss cared a lot about office presence, face time, filling out mandatory reports that no one read, work hours, etc. So I made sure to satisfy both of them, even though I could easily accomplish all my work in just a few hours a day.<p><i>Negotiation portion</i>: first, I found out when budgets were set, which was in September. Since performance reviews were done in December, that meant that by the time a performance review came about, your raise would have already been decided.<p>Then in May, I had a meeting with my boss where I told him something like ""I'd like to have a meeting to discuss compensation sometime next month."" So he knew it was coming-there was no surprise. Also note the timeline, the actual discussion was in June, giving my boss and his boss plenty of time before budgets would be fixed in September.<p>Then I made two write-ups: one presenting the value I'd contributed in terms my boss would value, and one presenting the value I'd contributed in terms <i>his</i> boss would value. I  then made my case to my boss, focusing on the value I'd provided, and asked for the double promotion so that I could fall back down to a single promotion if that didn't fly.<p>This was not a perfect approach, but even this much was enough to put me in probably the top 95% of engineers trying to negotiate a raise.<p>I should mention that pretty much the entire approach above came from Ramit Sethi's book <i>I Will Teach You To Be Rich</i>.",1327364384

When you say ""works can be retrieved into private possession,"" that makes it sound like you can pick out a public-domain work and claim it for your own, which is not at all a fair summary of what the court said. It's like hearing that locking somebody up without food or water counts as torture and false imprisonment, and then proceeding to tell everyone, ""It's an open question whether you can legally refuse to give someone your food when he asks."" I do not believe the question is all that open.<p>As anybody who takes the time to read the ruling will see, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the power to make laws that retroactively extend the copyright of certain works that had fallen into the public domain, and specifically said that Congress was empowered to do so if a treaty required it. I do think it's a bad ruling, but it is a far cry from a private party being able to swoop in and snatch works out of the public domain.",1327363470

Even though I love love love indie films, I can't help but pirate some of them out of several reasons:<p>- If I can choose between watching them <i></i>now<i></i> illegal and buying a DVD which will be released in half a year, guess which option I'll eventually choose? If the dvdrip is already going its rounds, why not release the movie online? If you are indie productions, you are not bound to all those country-releasing restrictions, are you?<p>- Say if I'm interested in a movie from Iceland. I am so not willing to pay 30-40 for a single movie DVD just because of shipping/handling costs etc. I, however, would happily pay around 15 bucks for watching it online or dl it somewhere digitally but LEGAL. The motto should be if YOU want to watch it, no matter where, you can do it NOW, LEGALLY, for say 10 bucks. That I'd do without any second thought. But seems like the idea of that hasn't gripped on within the indie movie world. I don't want their DVDs no more, if I really would want that physical medium I could easily burn that disc myself (if the movie is available in high enough definition), I don't wanna pay 10+ more bucks for that. Plus, If I like a movie, I will most likely buy their poster or something, so they even get around 50 bucks more for that.<p>As for cinemas: I frequently (about 1x a week, depending on which movies are in cinemas) visit our local arthouse cinema, and while the selection here in Switzerland is incredibly good (yet sometimes about 2 years after the releases.. but better late than never I guess), the tickets costs about 10-15 which is hell-a lot, especially comparing to Germany where I've been to cinemas for 3 bucks. I don't mind though, I like the cinema atmosphere with the comfy seats and the big screen.",1327363433

I think it would be valuable for other languages. Other languages can probably even do it better (imagining better type systems around units), but I&#x27;ve never seen an API that feels as right for manipulating time as Go&#x27;s time stdlib.<p>Then you might be interested in Joda-Time[1] and Boost.Date_time[2].  I&#x27;m not saying they are better or worse than Go&#x27;s time library.  They are quite powerful in their own right however.<p>Taking the example you presented:<p><pre><code>  take the more generic problem of: I have\n  a time, I have a duration, how do I tell\n  if that duration has passed?\n</code></pre>\nIn Joda-Time, it could look like (all types are in org.joda.time):<p><pre><code>  new Interval (yourStartDate, theDuration).contains (\n    candidate\n    );\n</code></pre>\nAnd in Boost.Date_Time (loosely based on this example[3]):<p><pre><code>  date d = day_clock::local_day ();\n  time_period allDay (ptime (d), ptime (d, hours (24)));\n\n  if (allDay.contains (someTimeInstance)) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n1 - <a href=""http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/userguide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/userguide.html</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/doc/html/date_time.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/doc/html/date_time.html</a><p>3 - <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/doc/html/date_time/examples.html#date_time.examples.time_periods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/doc/html/date_time/exam...</a>",1441864392

10196295,comment,10191668,10196166,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"If one alternative is larger than the others and it has an enum tag or pointer inside of it, such that you can squeeze the other alternatives before/after that tag word, you&#x27;re good to go.  If you had multiple alternatives of maximum size, they&#x27;d need some word in them, at the same offset/size, such that they don&#x27;t have conflicting representations.  An enum tag could overlap with a non-null pointer, and two enum tags with user-declared tag values (such that they do not overlap) could work too.  Or if you&#x27;re crazy you could discard having each type&#x27;s representation be computed solely as a function of what the type is made of, choosing their representations based on how well they pack into other types.  (Or worse yet, if you&#x27;ve got a borrow checker and your types are memcpyable, you could pack things and rejigger bytes however you wanted and then unfurl them into a temporary whenever something uses the interior value, <i>unless</i> I&#x27;m overlooking something.  So if you had Either<Either<u32, u32>, Either<u32, u32>>, you could represent that with a single tag whose value is 0, 1, 2, or 3, and when if the tag&#x27;s 2 or 3 and you make a reference to the interior value, either fix the tag in-place and fix it back when you&#x27;re done (if you&#x27;re the sole owner of the Either<Either...>), or copy the value out and let the borrower borrow that (and copy it back in when it&#x27;s done, if it was a mutable borrow).)",1441864010

10196280,comment,10180277,10190487,0,0,wfo,,,"Okay, if you define a required short limited period of service for public good as slavery then sure most civilized and uncivilized countries implement it and many people support it. I&#x27;ll concede this point, though I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s very many people in this universe who would use the word &#x27;slavery&#x27; to describe this so you may be a unique snowflake in this regard.<p>I think the reason multinationals treat employees better is because that since they are multinational, they are a single company subject to the laws of every nation: it is more efficient for them to treat EVERYONE by the same rights as the most stringent (Europe) whereas companies local to India or the US can abuse the lack of rights these countries give workers since they only deal with local workers.<p>And I would agree with you about consent being the big bright line. Except I think consent is very complicated. If you allowed people to sign themselves into slavery, people would consent to slavery. No matter how awful something is, if it&#x27;s allowed, people will &quot;consent&quot; to it -- the most desperate in society are forced by circumstances to consent to it. I think the word consent only has meaning when there are other meaningful options available. Which I think is the fundamental difference: the definition of consent. We all agree if someone puts a gun to your head and demands consent it&#x27;s not consent: but what if a faceless nameless system forces you to die or consent to whatever some collection of business owners demand and you agree: is this consent or not?

I love it.<p>The &quot;time&quot; library is to Go what the &quot;requests&quot; [non-standard] library is to Python, in terms of a great API and simplicity. For some reason in every other language I&#x27;ve used (important, I don&#x27;t know every time library! :P) the time library has always been adequate, but not much else.<p>I think Python&#x27;s &quot;datetime&quot; is a great example of a not great time library. At one point I was writing Python every day for a couple years. During that time, I could never ever remember the API for datetime, despite it being able to do what I needed to do well enough. I always had to open the docs. I think this is an example of an adequate library that just doesn&#x27;t have a great API.<p>Or, take the more generic problem of: I have a time, I have a duration, how do I tell if that duration has passed? Most developers I know (including myself) stumble on this for some period of time (see what I did there?), remembering what do I add to what and is it a greater than or a less than or do I subtract, etc. It is an easy problem, but always seems to require a little bit of thinking.<p>Go&#x27;s &quot;time&quot; library is nothing like this.<p>Go&#x27;s &quot;time&quot; library you will remember the API, it is intuitive. You can even guess it after writing Go for some period of time. It is that easy (ignoring the constants and non-standard printf-like function in it).<p>Go&#x27;s &quot;time&quot; comparison/arithmetic is incredible. Comparing times? Determining expiration? You&#x27;ll almost never get this wrong the first time. (But write tests anyways)<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is: even if you don&#x27;t like Go, take a look at how Go&#x27;s &quot;time&quot; library works. I think it would be valuable for other languages. Other languages can probably even do it better (imagining better type systems around units), but I&#x27;ve never seen an API that feels as right for manipulating time as Go&#x27;s time stdlib.",1441862241

Rational capitalists, on the other hand, use their assets in a way that maximizes gain and minimizes risk.<p>In an inflationary economy, the best investments are profitable businesses, or derivatives/aggregates thereof. Your capital is put to use buying means of production that makes more money than it costs and employs people along the way. Every year, the prices of the products you sell rise higher, but you&#x27;ve already paid for the factory! And you&#x27;re incentivized to fund that factory <i>now</i>, because factories are only going to get more expensive.<p>In a deflationary economy, cash is a low-risk/high-reward investment. Business, meanwhile, is <i>hard</i> - high-risk, aggregate low reward. Yes, consumers have more buying power, but production capacity is created and scaled by going into debt to buy capital equipment. In a deflationary economy, the real value of debt is increasing while prices are falling. So every day, the output of your assembly line is worth less, but what you owe on the line itself hasn&#x27;t changed. You just have to hope that you can pay off the factory and make some profit faster than the price of the widget it makes approaches zero.<p>Why isn&#x27;t this the case with technology? Because with technology, the rate of descent of the price people will pay for, say, smartphones still leaves room for a profit margin compared to the rate at which production is getting cheaper, and last year&#x27;s high-end production lines are still useful for making what&#x27;s now a third-world phone.<p>When you eventually get to a point of losing money on your factory, you lay off your employees, who now have less money to buy things from other factories, and if the economy gets on the wrong side of that snowball you&#x27;re looking at hell. The more this happens, the more likely investors are to stop investing in businesses and park their wealth in cash. The same checking account balance will always be able to buy a bigger factory tomorrow. You effectively stop the pump of economic activity, causing recession.<p>In the crudest terms, the central bank printing currency like crazy can make sitting on cash an even worse option than investing in business again, so you opt for the latter.<p>tl;dr deflation makes it more rational to own money and less rational to own things that try to make money by employing people.",1441861799

Deadlocks and other problems are, by default, much more controlled in their failure modes.<p>Rust focuses on truly outlawing large classes of horrible problems: dangling pointers, iterator invalidation, data races (and all without requiring a garbage collector, although a GC barely helps with the latter two). It also tries to help with other problems with fewer guarantees, but even just being memory safe is a huge step up from widely used low-level languages (i.e. C/C++).<p>All the languages you mention are quite opinionated in their concurrency, imposing costs that Rust doesn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t, for its target space. (And, Go certainly doesn&#x27;t provide any guarantees at all, not even data race freedom.)<p><i>> in addition to providing massive performance benefits vs. naive native threading</i><p>Important qualification: for IO bound tasks.

Why is this particular pet feature any more important than everyone else&#x27;s pet feature? (There have been so many requests: &quot;why couldn&#x27;t <i>X</i> make it into 1.0?&quot;)<p>If you&#x27;re concerned about theoretical fragmentation of the ecosystem... that&#x27;s not a problem in practice: mio is the standard.<p><i>> And judging by this thread, concurrent IO isn&#x27;t even on the core team&#x27;s roadmap</i><p>Wrong, it&#x27;s very much on the roadmap, e.g. Alex Crichton (core team member) has been adding windows support to mio himself.<p><i>> Look at the situation 10 months ago.

And humans have used them ever since.<p>Steve Jobs was right that &quot;If you see a stylus [as a requirement for basic input and manipulation of the device], they blew it [if they meant their device to be a mainstream consumer product].&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a corollary, though: If a tablet meant to be directly manipulated <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> support a stylus, it is going to be worse than a simple piece of paper and a pen for a wide variety of everyday tasks. (Meeting notes, class notes, sketches, etc.)<p>The iPad has sucked at all of those things, forever. (Despite the amazing (truly!) software enhancements that have made fingerpainting pretty expressive.)<p>I cannot think of a more fundamental advance Apple could have bestowed upon the iPad.<p>They are indeed playing catchup -- I have all the iPad generations at work and have never used them for much. I do use the Microsoft Surface Pro 3; it has a lot of shortcomings but is hugely, objectively superior to any iPad for taking notes (in just about any setting one would take free-form notes in). But it&#x27;s heavy, fans, Windows, etc.<p>I am a refugee from the end of the Newton days. In college, I took all my notes on an MP2000 and it was amazing. It totally worked, for text and diagrams, on balance better than paper. And nothing since then has been both highly portable and as good at note taking. The iPad is better than the Newton at lots of things -- movies and <i>media consumption</i> come to mind (</troll>) -- but even almost two decades later, no iPad has never been even close to as good as the MP2100 is at taking notes.<p>So, $1050 for the new iPad Pro plus the stylus? Funny coincidence, that&#x27;s exactly what I paid for my last Newton. Sign me the fuck up; I&#x27;ll take a couple.",1441861208

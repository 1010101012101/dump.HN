What I've found is past entries are there eg: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=63249"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=63249</a><p>So maybe the data collected in user?id=foo is currupted and could be rebuilt.

63834,comment,63009,63695,0,0,gcheong,,,"I lived in Japan for 6 years and found that it's quite an easy place to live in (and I lived in both a rural/industrial backwater as well as the Tokyo megapolis - Tokyo was much more fun). Yes, you do always feel like a foreigner but you also do not feel the pressure to conform to every norm like a typical Japanese person would. There are some signs that Japan is opening up more. For example, when I started working there you had to have your visa renewed every year, by the time I left it was possible to renew for 3 years.",1191627731

Often.  It may rain a bunch in a day somewhere else, but in the NW, it will drizzle for a week.\n",1191626309

Great design, the kind of work that people obsess over Apple for (at its best), cannot be made that way. Great design is art; it is expression; it is fundamentally opinionated.<p>It's not the only way to design a user interface, to be certain. But Doug isn't interested in working in that environment, because he thinks of himself as an artist, not a statistician.",1237708462

Population growth only occurs when the technology can support it.<p>If we were starting over without any of the knowledge we have now, then it seems reasonable to assume that it would take roughly the same amount of time.<p>If we had history to look back on, then maybe we would be looking at a few hundred years instead of a few thousand.<p>I think the more interesting question is, if we had the knowledge of our past history to look back on, what would we do differently? Would we be more green from the start, for instance? A lot of the problems with adapting to green tech today isn't that the technology is necessarily so knew and unknown, it's that well-established infrastructures and systems are in place that are implemented on vastly different technologies and the cost/logistics of replacing them is prohibitive.",1237706267

One quota was for below-average-income borrowers and that was a requirement that 56 percent of the loans bought by Freddie and Fannie had to conform to that guideline.  The second quota had to do with the low-income individuals.  These were individuals with 60 percent of the income of the census tract in which they lived, and by the time the bubble broke, that quota was 27 percent of all mortgages held by Freddie and Fannie had to fit within that quota.  And the final quota that was set in proportional terms was geographically targeted principally at inner cities and depressed areas, and that was a quota that said 35 percent of all the loans held by Freddie and Fannie or purchased by them had to fall into that category.""<p>Then there's Countrywide (not a bank and hence not covered by CRA), which originated something like 20% of America's subprime mortgages (Countrywide did not hold on to these mortgages but sold them to banks).

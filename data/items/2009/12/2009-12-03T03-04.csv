973663,comment,973490,973621,0,0,leelin,,,"I won't defend all of finance / trading, but maybe this analogy will satisfy you.<p>Think of sports tickets.  There is massive inefficiency in the primary market, meaning tickets you buy directly from the arena or on TicketMaster.  One inefficiency comes from all the season ticket holders who skip the majority of the games and only go to the ones they actually want to see.<p>We can fix this inefficiency on a secondary market (the scalpers, StubHub, etc).  A scalper might make a decent take by finding season ticket holders and buying the unused tickets.  Then, the scalper sells the tickets to fans who waited too late to buy (or won't pay full price).<p>Now we think the scalper is evil, because he just made money without ""adding value.""  Except he did add value... the season ticket holder and the last-minute-fan wouldn't have found each other without great effort.  Both ended up happier than if the scalper didn't exist.  Also, the scalper takes on some risk... he guaranteed the price he paid to the season ticket holder, had to hold the ticket, and then determine the correct time to sell.  If he held the ticket too late (or got too greedy), the game would begin and he'd have a worthless ticket!<p>We also need to somewhat regulate scalpers because if they have too much of an impact, they can seriously distort and manipulate prices (a very wealthy scalper can buy all the tickets to a popular game and sell them all at 10x the price).<p>This analogy isn't perfect for high-frequency trading or all market making, but I hope it shows why arbitragers both add value and reduce risk yet seem evil to all the participants.",1259812715

Yeah, they were technically coders, but most had little experience outside of their CS courses and maybe a little bit of extra hackery on the side. Someone who was fluent in HTML, CSS, JS, and, say, PHP, was practically non-existent... and the ones who were there were the aforementioned ""alphas"", who were more interested in shopping for cofounders on <i>their</i> project than joining someone else's. In short, Velocity was 10% seasoned coders looking for partners (and not finding any), and 90% dreamers with no significant talent or experience to contribute to anyone's project. I'm making this sound very harsh, but I was very disappointed in the calibre of people they were able to recruit.<p>In a startup environment, especially one that's operating purely as a small team of founders, you cannot have ""the Java guy"", everyone has to wear a large number of hats - and this talent pool simply did not exist in Velocity.<p>I can't help but think the whole concept a dormitory-as-incubator is somewhat misguided. IMHO it would be much better served for everyone to simply have a streamlined collaboration system where entrepreneurially-minded people can find each other, and to provide basic resources (how 'bout some servers instead of flashy phones?) to help them get there. Think JobMine, but for student projects.<p>Oh, and one more thing: Waterloo is a town filled with tech startups, yet Velocity's only backers seem to be large corporations.

I can think of only three reasons to prefer Ruby over it: (1) you want Rails etc.; (2) you don't like Lisp; (3) you really like Ruby. The latter two are matters of taste, which leaves #1.<p>[~] I haven't tried Clojure yet. Then again, I don't need to: the JVM is a drawback for me, and I don't need all those Java libraries right now.",1259809519

I'm pissed that I'm forced to use the mouse in Firefox (losing focus bug for many years) and Mac OS (why can't I tab to the button I want to press in a dialog), and I have to dig around the manual to learn the arcana of vim.<p>IMO the best interface is one where I can point and grunt to do arbitrary things, and while doing so the interface teaches me its own language with prompts and contextual help.",1259809349

With text-mode interfaces I have the feeling of telling the application what I want it to do in verbal terms, which I find easier to remember than which button or menu selection does what I want.<p>The author states: <i>The disadvantage I feel most keenly when using a terminal is the cognitive load. I have to keep more in my head when using a terminal/command-line-based interface.</i>  Again I find the opposite to be the case.  When I use Visual Studio I feel overwhelmed by the GUI.  Panels and scroll bars everywhere, buttons, menus, etc.  Contrast to Emacs, where I have, very simply, one large area for editing text.  I can focus on what I'm doing.<p>It's sort of a Feng Shui thing: the busy GUI is the cluttered room that drains your positive energy and causes constant low-level stress.  The text interface is the well-organized room that has everything you need but it's out of the way until you actually use it.",1259809224

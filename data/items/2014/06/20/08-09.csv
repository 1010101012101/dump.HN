Act accordingly.<p>That said, defense attorneys really need to be on the lookout for cases like this, where only vague references to confidential sources of information are disclosed.  If they know the tell-tale signs, they can ask the judge to issue orders during discovery that will put the prosecutor in the position of either being held in contempt of court or disclosing to the defense the specific illegal tactics the police used.",1403252011

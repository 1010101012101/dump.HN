But it was just slow.<p>The <i>secretly</i> not-working search was really annoying.<p>""App ideas"" - wow that's just annoying, but is so because you must know by now about how HN feels about <i>ideas</i>.<p>Overall good start, and a good problem to tackle but I don't realistically see how this would be any different from those ""hire a freelancer"" type sites. Don't mistake that for me ""hating"", rather it would just seem to me that the <i>more</i> users using your site, the more noise you are going to have to deal with. Whether that be ""biz-devs"" with million dollar ideas or designers straight outta devry, or lowball $20hr programmers.",1259985504
977715,comment,977623,977697,0,0,tdavis,,,"Interesting. Whenever I hear discussions of these sorts of things they're made out as basically swapping plugins -- Site X will now use Site Y's search algorithms, index, etc. instead of their own. If it truly is a melding that could result in better search results in aggregate, I like the idea that someone (or someones) could actually compete with Google.",1259985459

977707,comment,977461,977564,0,0,dmoney,,,"Here's an idea for an open source search engine:  If you could make the search index small enough, only the crawler would have to be hosted.  The actual search engine would run on each user's machine and download the diffs to the index regularly, and big brother would never see your queries.<p>This might be a pipe dream, as modern search indexes are probably much larger than the plaintext of the whole of the web.  Maybe it could be divided by subject..  I guess that would have the same privacy problem: the server would see which subjects you were requesting.  Maybe you could download the whole thing and only decompress locally the subjects and languages you wanted.",1259984957

977697,comment,977623,977682,0,0,rgrove,,,"The tech press hasn't done a very good job of being clear about the details of the deal, which is unfortunate, since it's left many people with an inaccurate picture of what it entails.<p>A modern search ""engine"" is really many, many engines. There are countless backend systems layered on top of and alongside the core algorithmic search system that most people think of when they think of a search engine (and that Microsoft will soon be running for Yahoo! as part of this deal). None of those other systems are going away as a result of this deal, nor is Yahoo! Search itself going away.<p>Yahoo! isn't just going to flip a switch and start using Bing's algorithmic search. As part of the deal, Microsoft has licensed the core algo search technology that currently powers Yahoo! Search, so you're likely to see more of a melding of the two.<p>Disclaimer: I work for Yahoo! Search (on the frontend, not the backend), but I speak for myself, not for Yahoo!.",1259984269

977683,comment,977642,977642,0,0,tdavis,,,"Two biggest problems with this:<p>1. The interface is awful and terribly slow. I don't feel like you can have filtering as a ""coming soon"" feature when the entire service is based around filtering. Also, I don't know what sort of awful JS is used to power the site but it really needs to go. It feels extremely sluggish (which after browsing Drew's other sites seems to be a theme).<p>2. It's built entirely on trust and very limited amounts of information. I feel like one could waste a lot of time contacting and vetting prospective collaborators.<p>I really want to like services like this; finding fellow designers/developers is difficult whether you have a project in mind or not and is really stodgy outside the comfort of referrals. Sadly, this isn't looking like a great fix to the problem (though it is a start).",1259983165

I met you at the first Rails conference in Chicago, I've used your well written CMS, so, I'm expecting addendum's to the related RFC's and an implementation into the major MUA's with all due haste :)<p>Seriously though, you make a great point.  There is a definite distinction between ""mail"" and ""notifications"".  When I went to go get my mail today, there were a bunch of actual letters, and, a bunch of postcard like notifications.    Most were SPAM of course (""use our maid service!"", ""you need new gutters, ours are the best!"", etc)... but some were legitimate reminders (""your XXX runs out in a week"", ""remember, we're coming by your house tomorrow"").<p>I'm all for it, seeing that the amount of online notification-like emails are getting more and more frequent (at least in my case).",1259982515

Can we show that priests had a disproportionate amount of the intelligence genes of the Christian population to begin with? Can we show that converted Jews (like my ancestors) didn't skew the results? Can we show, even, that priest didn't actually reproduce quite freely through the behind-the-scenes-hanky-panky they were famous for? The list could go on and on. Jeesh!",1259982152

Countermeasures were developed and applied.<p>➋ This exploit consumes connections similarly, but does so by trickling out data in the content section of a POST request. Countermeasures targeting <i>slowloris</i> are ineffective.<p>➌ Countermeasures for this will include HTTP request timeouts, but to support distant users operating over potentially saturated links you will have to set the timeout high enough that any well connected attacker will still be able to kill your server. (That has some extrapolation from me.)<p>§ Discussion<p>The real solution will be to not consume a process or other expensive resource until the entire POST request has been received by the server. (Expand to PUT and any other method with content in the request.)<p>This becomes difficult in HTTP/1.1. To really support 1.1 you have to give the request the option to reject before the content is sent. (Yes you other old farts, the client doesn't necessarily blindly send the content, but waits for your server to say ""ok, the method, resource, and headers look good, send me the content"".) I suppose you could force all those decisions to be made by the HTTP server, but that would be sad.",1290441479

Believe you me India takes Office politics to a whole new level that Americans can only dream of :-).<p>Partly this comes from the fact that the Indian managers  of ""offshore dev centres"" don't have any real power to  make decisions(as compared to their American counterparts).

1930106,comment,1929247,1929247,0,0,mcantor,,,"This blog post touches on so much!<p>First off, I think it's very interesting that the blogger characterized the assumption of promotion to be a very Indian/Asian thing, because it's absolutely something that, in America, is considered a very American thing!  The whole ""Peter Principle"" concept of being ""promoted to incompetence"" is lamentably American, and it certainly shows itself in things like <i>The Office</i>, which began in the UK, too.<p>The part about being ""just a developer"" at ThoughtWorks also seems very, very similar to the corporate culture at W. L. Gore and Associates[1], which Malcolm Gladwell discussed in <i>The Tipping Point</i>.  At W. L. Gore, everyone is assigned the title of ""Associate,"" and that's it.  Same deal!<p>The developer/manager transition has always fascinated and confused me.  I feel like the term ""manager"" is overloaded.  To the extent that a manager's responsibilities are to shield his team from corporate politics, to make sure the code they're working on is solving the <i>right</i> problem, and to keep the dev team happy, I would say that going from developer to manager should <i>not</i> be a vertical move, but a <i>lateral</i> one.  Writing code and managing a team of coders have <i>nothing</i> to do with each other.<p>On the other hand, the managerial position that I would describe as <i>lead developer</i> feels like a more appropriate ""next step.""  A lead developer might not write much code (which is similar to a ""manager""), and a lead developer might be called upon to evaluate and discuss business requirements (which is similar to a ""manager""), but his concern is the technical repercussions of the decisions made in that space, <i>not</i> the political ones.<p>I'm sure that many people with far more experience have written much clearer explanations of this pattern, but it's what I have seen so far.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._L._Gore_and_Associates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._L._Gore_and_Associates</a>",1290440808

If it wasn't CMOs it would have been something else.<p>The fundamental problem here is systematic risk, a bank should be able to fail without bring down other banks, unfortunately the system wasn't able to cope with the failure of a large number of banks who were all exposed to the same risk.<p>If a bunch of the big US car companies failed we may well have seen the same thing, because a lot of the US banks are heavily exposed to that sector. It just so happened it was mortgages that happened to be the tipping point this time.<p>Imagine your a bank and you have a bunch of other banks you deal with, you assign them all individually a ""credit risk score"" so you know how much extra to charge them to protect you against the risk of them failing before they have a chance to pay you what they owe you (much the same way as credit scores work for people).<p>But you have no-way of understanding the correlation between the risks, if all the banks your dealing with are actually exposed to the same underlying risk (i.e the CMO market) then the risk your exposed to is actually far higher than the sum of the individual risks. But obviously the banks you're dealing with can't tell you what their underlying risks are because that's propriety information, so all you have to go on is the risk rating given by ratings agencies.<p>This is a fundamentally hard problem to solve.

Maybe it can't be done, and maybe <i>we wouldn't really like it</i> if we got it.<p>In Raghuram Rajam's book (Fault Lines) there is something about half of what a country needs to develop is capital, and part is the human organization that can turn this capital into development. As in sane institutions and sane business procedures and people. I would say such a thing is mostly lacking in Brazil, for example: We do have lots of very very intelligent, educated people but it is not critical mass --- also, it is not enough to be seen by society as a driver of lifestyle enhancement (or something like it).<p>It's easy to see how Americans can buy more Snickers with their salaries and assume that their society is better, but technology has changed all the rules, maybe it changed the rule that ""more money is better"" too.<p>Which also turns out to be a derisive doubt: In wanting to ""make a Philippine Silicon Valley"" are you not really trying to get a better pay for the same job you currently get?"" It is a totally valid goal, mind you, but also a goal that means you lack a socially contextual mode of analysis.<p>So i would say: Be very good at what you do, and then do something with it.<p>Which in turn means: I only think a ""Silicon Valley"" thing can happen with real people doing things that they are personally enthusiastic about.

If they like your service, they buy you and provide the needed addresses.<p>If not, you are screwed.<p>Or you get one of those IPv6 addresses which will be unreachable for a majority of internet users because it's totally not in the interest of ISPs to provide V6 connectivity.<p>I'm telling you.

That's an emotionally charged interpretation of a company trying to increase conversion rates.

Once you enter your data into one of these services, you cannot easily use them on another site. Each site is a silo, walled off from the others""<p>This has been pretty much every ecommerce site since the 90s.  I didn't hear anyone clamoring that pets.com, drugstore.com or 1800flowers.com was going to threaten the future of the web.  There's more to it than just that ""data is siloed"" issue.  Most ecommerce sites don't have a network effect built-in - they deliver value to me regardless of how many other people use them.<p>There's the threat of inertia - people won't re-enter their information in to new systems as those systems are introduced.  That's certainly a concern, but I really don't see it as a threat.  AOL was king for years, and people were scared of them.  Then MySpace.  Now Facebook.  I suspect as people grow up, the focus may move to something that's not yet developed.  Certainly the game is Facebook's to lose right now, but I don't think they'll hold on forever.<p>Granted, I think Tim's point is not specifically <i>facebook</i> but the walled/siloed data sites in general.

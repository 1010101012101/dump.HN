Programmers should be able to concentrate on producing the right code and not to answer support requests, report individually about progress to sales people, write documentation, worry about testbeds, etc.
Another important point: the project manager should make very clear on what needs to be done - clear specifications, clear communication, clear tasks. Everybody should know what the others work on and what the progress and difficulties are.",1214819546

I don't know whether your question is/should be about a payment processor though; using PayPal as an invoicing system is fine but is the real question, ""Should I be using PayPal?""",1214819342
231854,comment,231783,231783,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I would think there are pyschological differences b/w angels and VCs: a VC is a business and you are expected to shop around whereas an angel could be anyone from a family member, friend, referral from a friend, or a member of an angel group. I don't know - I just think that there is a percentage of angels who will get a bit miffed if you try to play them against someone else. I don't know that it makes it wrong to do so; I just point it out.",1214819148

231851,comment,231783,231783,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If you're taking the other piece of advice that YC generally gives, you aren't stopping to deal with funding--you're focusing one person on funding, the other(s) on continuing to build the product.  You can afford to talk to three or four sources of funding.  The fire of competition will allow you to close faster, most likely, because the investor cannot sit on their hands thinking about it--they're either in or the next investor will be.",1214818797
231850,comment,231678,231813,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We only hire people who have Open Source code we can spend some time with.  How else are we going to know they're worth a damn?  I don't have faith in my interview abilities to suss out the good ones (and Yegge's articles on the subject make me even less confident in that area).  But, I can look at a developers past achievements and know whether they can produce good code fast.<p>Then again, my co-founder and I have both been Open Source developers for at least a decade, and consider it the ""normal"" way to build software.  And it's definitely good for your employment possibilities...I've turned down several quite awesome jobs and recruitment attempts over the years (I turned them down because I don't enjoy working for others, generally, not because they weren't very fine jobs with very fine companies).  Google among them (my co-founder was unable to resist the allure of Google).",1214818641

This is a recurring argument.<p>But the article warns about the low birthrates in Europe. This is a contradiction, because europeans birthrates include the babies of everybody, including the recently immigrated people, wich means that if the muslims were making as much babies as they say, then our birthrates would not be so low.<p>There is a logical fallacy in this argument. Wich is confirmed by the fact that nearly all muslims societies are experiencing a decline in their birthrate, and some have even ""catastrophic"" (it's their word, not mine) low birthrates (Iran for example).<p>I hope it was clear.",1214818618

I'm not advocating a 56 hour sleep week but I can't go more than 3 days w/o having 8 hrs of sleep one night or I am not at my best. Maybe that works for him but I firmly believe everyone is different; we all have specific sleep needs that allow us to reach our peak.",1214818286
231844,comment,231678,231707,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Our business (Virtualmin) is about 90% Open Source.  There are only a few components of our products that aren't Open, and those primarily because they simply require <i>so much</i> tedious maintenance and are related to security.  There are a few other features that are included in the proprietary version and not the GPL version because they are pretty much only useful for people making money with the software.  It's probably not wholly the kind of thing the author of the article would approve of, since it does involve closing off some of the code...but the popularity of our Open Source projects have gone up notably since we started the company, so I think we're walking the fine line effectively.",1214818114

PHP definitely tries to perform a numeric comparison on two strings if it thinks they are both numerical strings, but this behaviour changed in PHP 5.4 [0]. heron87&#x27;s scenario was reported as a bug [1], changed in PHP 5.4 and caused new problems [2].<p>See the string comparison routine in 5.3 [3] and 5.4 [4]. The new implementation <i>still</i> inspects the strings to see if they are numeric and then tries to do a numeric equality check rather than string equality check, leading to amusing tricks like<p><pre><code>     var_dump(&quot;0xFF&quot; == &quot;255.0&quot;); // true!\n</code></pre>\nBut if both values overflow the long type and their double representations are equal, the new implementation falls back to actual string equality. A quick check at [5] shows that both values heron87 compared have identical double representations, assuming (sizeof double == 8), so the new representation detects the long overflow, then it sees that double representations are also identical, and then it returns to string equality rather than numeric equality. The old implementation did not consider long overflow and ended up comparing the numeric values.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://3v4l.org/a0nKq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://3v4l.org/a0nKq</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=54547\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=54547</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=62097\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=62097</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-5.3/Zend/zend_operators.c#L1992\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-5.3/Zend/zend_operat...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/5.4/Zend/zend_operators.c#L2039\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/5.4/Zend/zend_operators....</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754/index.xhtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754/index.xhtml</a>",1387966373

And in a year of running experiments (therapy, going on retreat, writing from the gut, being more honest than I&#x27;m comfortable with) it seemed like an interesting experiment to end the year with. The less Christmas-y things I did this month, the more I noticed how people around me were only doing things because they felt they had no choice not to. Christmas parties, getting pissed up for 5 or 6 days on the trot with work colleagues they didn&#x27;t even like that much, etc etc.<p>2. Although I love them very much, my family are a pain in the ass to spend time with. And the pressure for everyone to &quot;just get along&quot; on Christmas Day makes things even worse. If I had my own family it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if I wanted to spend it with them — so why should that change because I&#x27;m single?<p>3. After a month of 7 day weeks, I need some quality me time. Just been on a solo bike ride around London. Not sure what I&#x27;ll be doing with the rest of the day. But solitude is a fine gift to give yourself.<p>4. Christmas Jumpers. Is it just me or have they reached a new low this year? More moronic than ironic. For me they are seem to be symbolic of the hollowness of Christmas.<p>5. I&#x27;m £6,000 in debt and have boxes of unused items all over my bedroom. I don&#x27;t need more stuff, nor do I have money to buy any. By opting out of Christmas I won&#x27;t be receiving another stack of things I don&#x27;t need.<p>6.

What he says about the culture of rote memorization and lack of outside box thinking holds some merit before we all cry about how this has nothing to do with East Asian culture. I don&#x27;t give a damn about culture but if it&#x27;s preventing you from being able to pass a flying simulation test that is standard, it pretty much makes me NOT want to fly with that airline.<p>I don&#x27;t care if American airlines offer crappy inflight customer service compared to Asiana airlines, I DEMAND a pilot that have the qualification to fly and land the airplane in all possible scenarios. If Asiana pilots can&#x27;t even pass the flight sims, no way in hell I&#x27;m letting them fly the plane.<p>I&#x27;m just so angry after reading the article. How fucking hard can it be? I played Microsoft Flight Simulator since 4.5 since the DOS version. Of course the flight simulation is more difficult than a simulator on the computer but I am trying to illustrate how ridiculous the Korean pilots attitude is. It&#x27;s like they treat it as some demeaning labor (Korean society judges a person a lot by their occupation if it&#x27;s not a traditionally Confucius approved position like scholar, professor, lawyer, doctor, prosecutor). You are responsible for hundreds of peoples lives and you can&#x27;t even land the fucking plane on a flight simulator via visual approach because you are afraid of screwing up or looking bad in front of your superior officer? You can&#x27;t even say that the emperor is naked because someone above you says he isn&#x27;t?<p>And why the hell did that Korean American pilot for Asiana or KAL get arrested and JAILED, for starting a union? Was he suspected of being a communist for wanting to be paid by the flight hour time?",1387965793

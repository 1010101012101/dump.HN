8912730,comment,8912332,8912332,0,0,kcorbitt,,,"This isn&#x27;t exactly an answer to your question, but a general piece of advice: you might have more luck if you take your &quot;very technical&quot; product and explain it in a way that others can relate to more easily. Something like &quot;We&#x27;ve built a service that allows programmers to create Android apps from their iOS applications automatically.&quot; And then follow that up by explaining that typically building an Android app takes a full-time engineer 6 months at £XXXX/month, while your product makes that unnecessary, so you think you can charge developers £XXX to use it.<p>When you give a bit of context to what you&#x27;ve accomplished, it shouldn&#x27;t take someone with a BSc in CS to understand what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>All that said, sometimes the best way to find good investors is to just go where they are, as others have mentioned.<p>EDIT: sibling comment by mseebach beat me to this point by about 5 minutes",1421686749

8912726,comment,8912078,8912654,0,0,dalke,,,"&quot;if you take code, you must give back code.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not the intention. It&#x27;s a forward mechanism, not a backwards one. If you distribute code to person/company/entity X then you must also distribute the source code, or provide a way for X to get the source code.<p>If you make changes but never distribute the code then you don&#x27;t need to distribute your modified code to anyone. If you only provide a service then you don&#x27;t need distribute the code to anyone. Even if you modify gcc, sell me a copy, and distribute the changed source code to me, that doesn&#x27;t mean you or I need to give the changes back to the gcc project.<p>The &quot;fear&quot;, as I understand it, is that the Linux kernel and gcc are the two biggest GPL-based projects. If gcc is diminished, then fewer people will be aware of, much less agree with or advance, the ideals of software freedom. The technical advantages of gcc are used as marketing for software freedom.<p>Hiding GNU projects behind commercial and proprietary solutions front-ends reduces the marketing. Hence also the issue about &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; as &quot;Linux&quot; diminishes the marketing of the GNU project.",1421686676

8912723,comment,8908462,8909374,0,0,virmundi,,,"My question is what do you mean by 2TB? At my current client, we have 5 TBs of data sitting (that&#x27;s relatively recent). Before we had 2-ish. However, we had over 30 applications doing complex fraud calculations on that. &quot;Moving data&quot; (data being read and then worked) is about 40 TB daily. Even with SSD and 256 GB of RAM, a single machine would get overwhelmed on this.<p>If you&#x27;re only working one app on less than 1 TB, maybe you don&#x27;t need something as complex as Hadoop. But given that a cluster is easy to setup (I made a really simple NameNode + Two Data nodes in 45 minutes, going cold), it might not be a bad idea.<p>I&#x27;ll take this further and say that some tools for Hadoop that are not from  Apache are really nice to work with even in a for non-Hadoop work. For example, I&#x27;ve got to join several 1 GB files together to go from a relational, CSV model into a Document store model. Can I do this with command line tools? Maybe. Cascading makes this really easy. Each file family is a tap. I get tuple joins naturally. I wrote an ArangoDB tap to auto load into ArangoDB. It was fun, testable and easy. All of this runs sans-hadoop on my little MBP.<p>Fun fact about the Cascading tool set is that I can take my little app from my desktop and plop it onto a Hadoop cluster with little change (taps from local to hadoop). Will I do that in my present example? No. Can I think of places where that&#x27;s really useful? Yes, daily 35 fraud models&#x27; regression tests executed with each build. That&#x27;s somewhere around 500 full model executions over limited, but meaningful data. All easily done courtesy of a framework that targets Hadoop.",1421686636

Which I can attest is no fun (I worked for UniPress on the EMACS that he illicitly forked GNU Emacs from, I went from a LMI Lisp Machine ally, and later roommate when he started GNU, to a &quot;Software Hoarder&quot; (note UniPress shipped their Emacs with undistributeble source)).  It&#x27;s a very big thing to split one or more communities like that, a potentially fatal thing, and this discussion has brought out that GNU Emacs is already losing a lot of mind share in the otherwise sort of natural for it C and C++ communities.<p>One problem here is that RMS is not a C++ programmer (not an entirely unwise decision!), the languages he programs in, to the extent he does anymore, don&#x27;t require this sort of thing, and apparently doesn&#x27;t appreciate how this is a deal breaker for modern C++ programming.  Or doesn&#x27;t care, and how that&#x27;s decreasing GCC mindshare as well.<p>Because of this policy with GCC, 99.999% plus of the the academic mind share is with LLVM, and the only thing keeping it from taking over is it&#x27;s relative paucity of backends.",1421686495

Haskell says nothing about how lists are implemented, so with respect to &quot;true&quot;ness (I&#x27;m not really sure what this means), we can cannot generalize. A sufficiently optimized Haskell compiler implemented in silicon would have the liberty of using the memory in-place.<p>&quot;Trueness&quot; means &quot;doing the real QuickSort&quot;. The one you posted doesn&#x27;t. You can get the real QuickSort, but not with one line. A better compiler might identify useful invariants; you were not using such a compiler.<p>But if you had such a compiler, you wouldn&#x27;t need to write I that way; you could just specify what conditions the final sort would obey, and that would be enough. You wouldn&#x27;t need to tell it to filter explicitly.",1421686129

Account should be understood as user account, not bank account.<p>Forget about Bitcoin for the moment. We build a new distributed currency. You can sign up for an account and with that account you get one vote to vote for (blocks of) transactions you consider valid. But because there is no central authority performing identity checks the bad guys can just create a million accounts and use them to vote for bad (blocks of) transactions. This is what I previously called fake accounts - several accounts by one person to vote for bad (blocks of) transactions.<p>And now back to Bitcoin. Bitcoin&#x27;s solution to this problem is mining. A vote in the Bitcoin network is a mined block and because mining is expensive this prevents users from casting arbitrarily many votes which is the logical equivalent of a fake account prevention mechanism. It is not perfect because with enough money for hardware and electricity you can still obtain more votes than others but it is no longer as easy as signing up for a million accounts with a million different email addresses.<p>I hope this helps clarifying my point.",1421684839

Review queues are weeks or months long. The article makes a good point about the necessary man hours to work on OpenStack. I&#x27;ve seen code removed not because it didn&#x27;t have a maintainer, but because 200 lines of code didn&#x27;t have 3-5 full time developers. Insanity persists and money talks.<p>Looking back, I&#x27;d say that OpenStack Nova in the beginning was never this bad. It may not have been the best thing ever, because it wasn&#x27;t, but no code needs to be terribly great in the beginning. The beginning of a project needs good process more than it needs good code, and OpenStack didn&#x27;t establish this well enough, early enough.<p>OpenStack never had a solid, centralized architectural vision. Anyone that attempted to contribute architecturally was essentially ejected. Those that flushed millions into controlling the process and millions more into building adhoc features got their way. I mistakenly advocated early for wrangling control from Rackspace. The increased influence gained by individual contributors was quickly dwarfed by large corporate influences.<p>I&#x27;m still involved with OpenStack, but far less than I had been in the past. Mostly, I prefer to see myself peripherally involved where I might improve the lives of those trapped in that ecosystem, either to help them deal with the pains they&#x27;ve inflicted upon themselves, or to escape them entirely.",1421684306

Here&#x27;s a great tidbit about why all the original functions have ridiculous, inconsistent naming schemes:<p>> &quot;Well, there were other factors in play there. htmlspecialchars was a very early function. Back when PHP had less than 100 functions and the function hashing mechanism was strlen(). In order to get a nice hash distribution of function names across the various function name lengths names were picked specifically to make them fit into a specific length bucket. This was circa late 1994 when PHP was a tool just for my own personal use and I wasn&#x27;t too worried about not being able to remember the few function names.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s right: Every one of the original function names has a different character length because length was used as a lookup. There are a lot of clowny things like this that have never been stamped out of the language.<p>Add to that its history of being a beginner language that most of its early adopters sprinkled into HTML and where many people who mayyybe have no business being professional programmers started making a career out of it. This severely undermined PHP&#x27;s credibility as a language for professionals even though good software can be created in PHP in the right hands.<p>That all said, I spent about year coding in Hack, and while the parts that still feel like PHP are annoying, it is awesome in so many other ways. Hopefully it either starts to unseat PHP or PHP turns into Hack at some point.",1421683579

As a freelancer, the author likely spends much of his time working on small business blogs and brochure sites.<p>These are frequently set up on a single server, containing code, database, and any file storage necessary.  They&#x27;re frequently written by cloning and modifying a framework, making reinstalling from a known good copy difficult to impossible.  They often have no version control and are frequently configured to allow the webserver to modify code, so there is rarely a known good copy of the site code.  In short, what&#x27;s running on the compromised server is often the only usable iteration of the site&#x27;s code available.<p>I hope nobody on HN would willingly set up a site like this, but the fact remains that they exist and need to be maintained.

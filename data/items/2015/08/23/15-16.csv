Sure, there are differences, but they&#x27;re rather superficial. One such difference is in how you, as a human, categorize commits in that dag - what git calls a branch isn&#x27;t what hg calls a branch.  But so what?<p>In day-to-day use I can&#x27;t imagine that the vast majority of git users would really notice a ifference if they used hg instead; and I suspect the same thing holds for bzr too.  There&#x27;s no meaningful performance difference.  But the point is also that reverse is mostly true too - why not choose git it it&#x27;s good enough?<p>And then git&#x27;s real advantage shines through - it&#x27;s by far the most common, and that lets you cooperate with a large number of other developers simply because lots of people know git.  Oh, and github is popular too and git-only.  Then there&#x27;s the fact that bzr seems dead, as does monotone.  The advantage is largely social - though if the currect pace of development continues it way well become technical.",1440345488

10105801,comment,10105345,10105424,0,0,someguydave,,,"&quot;I ... wonder how there are so many people making so much more money than I do.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this a great deal, and there are at least four responses:<p>1.) As pointed out by others, I suspect a majority of households living in these expensive areas could not actually afford to &#x27;rebuy&#x27; their house on the basis of current income.<p>2.) As a corollary, the prices you are seeing are only paid by marginal actors who happen to have the income or savings needed to get a mortgage.   Thus only a minority of people living in the expensive area can actually &#x27;afford&#x27; it.<p>3.) Lots of people are willing to commit to paying 50% or more of their gross income to a mortgage.  They win (at the margin) and drive up housing prices.<p>4.) The money lent for residential housing is &#x27;backed&#x27; by the government, which essentially means it is printed (not in the sense that it is printed at origination time, but it is instead printed when then entire housing market goes south and the Fed needs to bail out the Treasury/GSEs.).  I would note that printing a dollar is the same as thieving a dollar from the sum of all dollars held.<p>So in conclusion, the reason housing is expensive is because people are willing to take risks with other people&#x27;s money.  If you aren&#x27;t that kind of person, you probably don&#x27;t belong in one of these expensive housing markets.",1440345461

The object pipeline does not exist outside of the PowerShell/.NET runtime.<p>Pipelines in Unix shells use OS-level functionality to connect standard streams of data, often encoded as text, between arbitrary executables written in any language.<p>The reason this is confusing is because one of the main tactics used in PowerShell promotion is to disingenuously compare PowerShell&#x27;s &quot;object pipeline&quot; to Unix pipelines in order to try to make it appear to be more novel than it is, when they should be comparing it to what it&#x27;s functionally equivalent to, which is function chaining within a single runtime.",1440345387

I&#x27;ve commented before at work that if this is all I was able to do in the time I&#x27;ve had at most smaller companies we&#x27;d either have gone bankrupt or I&#x27;d have been fired.

Slack isn&#x27;t allowed in most places in the F500 as shadow IT goes, for example, but they hit the billion dollar club within months practically because they approached chat in a small manner that Salesforce did.

The latter resulted in the same books (with English spelling conventions) appearing in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc.<p>There have been attempts to change this. To quote from a Guardian article from 2008:<p>&quot;We are all struggling to free ourselves from the proprietorial attitudes of the US and UK that continue to dominate the publishing world,&quot; said Juliet Rogers, chief of one of Australia&#x27;s largest independent publishers Murdoch Books, and former president of the Australian Publishers Association. &quot;The UK fails to grasp that the Empire is dead and that Commonwealth markets are no longer theirs by right [and] the US views Canadian rights as an automatic extension of their territory, even though they frequently have no intention of responsibly exercising those rights.&quot;<p>&quot;Because British or American publishers get first dibs and insist on British Commonwealth rights, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are not getting a look in,&quot; added Andrew Wilkins, director of Australian publisher Wilkins Farago. This is to the disadvantage of authors, he explained, as exported copies of books are sold at reduced royalty rates, &quot;so in theory the author could be making three to four times more money by having a local publisher – it makes no sense.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/17/canada-australia-commonwealth-frankfurt-publishers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/17/canada-australi...</a>",1440344399

And my concern could be a red herring.  I, personally, have no doubt that the field of biology is enormously diverse, and in most academic settings I&#x27;d consider this pretty much a non-issue.  I think the over-arching fear is the US has nominated 9 people, none of whom are likely to know a significant amount about genetic engineering, to decide (in essence) the fate of genetic engineering and the &quot;patentability&quot; of specific inventions / discoveries.<p>What I think the field of genetic engineering may need in its future, is the equivalent of a Linus Torvalds in their field.

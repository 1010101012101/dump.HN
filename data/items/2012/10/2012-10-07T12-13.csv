She was doing a PhD in a subject that was important to me (diabetes) and that I got to know quite a bit about.<p>Being a curious person I then started to read more about it and found a published study that was done at a different university on the <i>exact same subject</i>. There was no difference between experimental set-up, the parameters and the results achieved to that date matched.<p>When confronted with this she responded that she already knew that, her PhD advisor had selected the study and had presented it to the grant givers as a novel approach. He clearly already knew what the outcome would be, and the fact that it would be positive and that the grant gatekeepers would not find out about the other study until it was either too late (which would mean they'd keep quiet because they had not done their jobs properly) or at all (because nobody really cared). She didn't want to rock the boat just wanted her PhD over and done with, confronting the advisor would have been the end of her career for sure, whereas duplicating a bunch of work that you already know the outcome of is ok.<p>This study was quite extensive and burned through a whole pile of resources.<p>At the time I was quite shocked by all this, that in academia there would be such cynical misconduct. According to the lady this was perfectly normal and par for the course in her field.<p>It's one thing for a group to openly try to duplicate the results of another, it is a different thing to use the vastness of the scientific body as a means to re-do success stories found elsewhere to increase your local standing.<p>There is a Samwer Brothers parallel in there somewhere.",1349613785
4623202,comment,4622142,4622819,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The difference is extreme. In the Space Shuttle case NASA signed off on every little detail of the design and manufacture of the vehicle and told Rockwell to go build it, deliver it to them, and then they undertook operations with the vehicle. This is very comparable to, say, the US military procuring and operating a fighter jet such as the F-22.<p>Now let's look at SpaceX's Falcon/Dragon. SpaceX financed, designed, and proved the Falcon-9 launch vehicle on its own. To its own specs. To its own design. And to its own internal budget. Similarly, SpaceX began designing the Dragon pressurized spacecraft on its own. NASA came along and offered up the potential for a contract for resupply of the ISS, they did not specify the design or method of construction of the launch vehicle and spacecraft to achieve this goal, nor did they fund the complete development costs of such a system. Instead, SpaceX stepped up and said ""hey, we have something that we think could fit your needs"" (as did Orbital Sciences Corp.) and then NASA provided some moderate funding to help with specialized development costs for ISS resupply and then extended the opportunity for ISS resupply contracts after a successful demonstration. This is comparable to buying a plane ticket.<p>SpaceX's NASA contracts are quite lucrative for them (because they can provide a service at a lower price than the competition but it is a very highly priced service) but even without them they are poised to reap massive profits from bog-standard commercial launch services. They have a contract with Orbcomm to launch 18 satellites, and contracts with MDA Corp., SES, Thaicom, NSPO, Asiasat, SS/Loral, Argentina, Israel, and others to launch commercial satellites over the coming years. Because SpaceX is able to set the retail price of its launches at the current market floor (somewhere around the per kg price of the Long March, Soyuz, or Proton) despite their underlying costs being much lower they are able to pocket a healthy profit per launch, which should fatten their wallets mightily even over the next few years let alone the next decade or so.",1349613691

You're essentially a part-time cofounder in some ways because the product/business model can rapidly change depending on who you're working with, and you have essentially zero guarantee as to how you will know about the success of the business later on.<p>I also saw someone at a startup weekend earlier this year do the same idea, although he came off as a shady businessperson in the process, and had a very hard time explaining how it all worked.<p>Overall, I'm tired of business folks making this idea. Unless someone else outside the business does an official valuation, this doesn't really make sense. Also, business folks tend to think ""hey, i'll rent a coder as 'hours for equity' then build just enough to pitch to investors, then find 'real people' while i have tons of leverage"".

Depends: there are some terrible vendors, and there are some very shoddy open source security projects. Open source software, with a couple of exceptions, are rarely audited professionally. Widely used open source projects get shaken out for memory corruption and XSS. They do <i>not</i> as a rule get thoroughly evaluated for cryptographic flaws.<p>A more precise way to state my preferences:<p>I trust _crypto_ from Microsoft, Apple, or (especially) Google more than I trust _crypto_ from a developer I&#x27;ve never heard of before. I do not as a rule trust rando closed-source projects.",1434524377

9730378,comment,9727448,9727448,0,0,PhilWright,,,"I spent four years as a contractor between 1997-2001 and all my work was sourced from recruitment agencies. Remember that the recruiters have no idea about anything technical. They match the buzzwords from your CV against a company and if they look close enough will forward it to the company. I once had a recruiter call me up to ask what &#x27;API&#x27; was. Not sure he was capable of understanding it was a generic term and not a specific technology.<p>Use them to find companies to work for but apart from that you should ignore their advice. Be willing to work for a lower than standard rate for the first job in order to get some experience on the CV. If you work somewhere and you really impress them, become indispensable then you can up your rate when the contract is renewed. Make sure you keep contact details for other contractors so when looking for a new contract you can ring around to find out who is hiring.",1434524320

By going big-endian, you&#x27;d be both forced to eat a byte-swapping performance hit on every load or store to these formats, and you&#x27;d break a tremendous amount of software that assumes it is running on a little-endian architecture. Dealing with those headaches would absolutely not be worth the trouble for the almost insignificant benefit of slightly easier to read hex dumps, or the slightly more useful benefit of string comparison via memcmp that could be better performed by dedicated SIMD instructions anyway.",1434523945

I never had a client pull a contract on me, I always left on my terms. On average I lasted two years until I moved on. Major Retail, Funds management, Investment banking was my progression.<p>My background was Java (I work almost exclusively with Clojure now, and love it). Java was the language of business in London and I presume it still is. If you want to get a well paid gig in a smart office for a bank or funds management firm then Ruby is not your friend. Why was I motivated to move towards Investment Banking? Well, I&#x27;m competitive and it&#x27;s the hardest market to crack, and it pays a premium. That&#x27;s it. If you want to stay pure to one language or another and not use your rare skills for the best economic result for yourself that&#x27;s another choice.<p>The market is huge, once you&#x27;ve got a recruiter who likes you you&#x27;ll be offered work fairly continuously.<p>My contractor rate was roughly double what I would have earned permanent. The contractors I worked with were no better or worse than the permanent staff I worked with, they just had the confidence to strap on their contractor pants and go to work.

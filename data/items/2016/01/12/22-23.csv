Okay, that part is simple: we can have an entire space of these generated by a rule, like gmail&#x27;s addr+whatever@gmail.com.<p>But then how does alice <i>invalidate</i> such an address that is misused?<p>I want it so that any address that is not valid generates an SMTP bounce; I don&#x27;t want an infinite space of aliases  that map to an address to all be considered valid, but a specific set, controlled by the user. When an element is removed from that set, then further attempts to send to it generate SMTP bounces.<p>Furthermore, I want it to be <i>completely</i> anonymized, just like Throttle are doing, as in:<p><pre><code>   <random-chars>@mydomain -> alice@mydomain\n</code></pre>\nThe text &quot;alice&quot; doesn&#x27;t appear in the plaintext anywhere, and cannot be reversed out of the local part.<p>EDIT:<p>To solve one of these problems, what we can do is assign to each user some random identifier of fixed length, from which further addresses can be generated. For instance alice@mydomain also gets &quot;xZa3f@mydomain&quot; when the account is created. To this local part, arbitrary characters can be appended: &quot;xZa3f4abPspamming.dickheads.com@mydomain&quot; such that this still routes to alice@mydomain.  Doesn&#x27;t handle the SMTP-level invalidation requirement though.",1452639487

Klarna in Europe has a similar system called SOFORT in a lot of countries processing millions of transactions [0].

Hopefully it will not, given that some of those regressions involved soundness issues and other things (integer fallback) that were &quot;clearly wrong&quot;, which ought to be mostly weeded out before long.  That said, the rate of new features in the language and especially libraries seems likely to <i>increase</i> a bit in the nearish features, given the size of the feature request backlog (or not - you&#x27;d know better than I).<p>But even at a rate of significantly less than 4%, there&#x27;s still trouble.  That figure is based on the number of <i>root</i> regressions, right?  (If I&#x27;m wrong, disregard the rest of this paragraph, but I don&#x27;t think so...)  That is, the number of crates that break on their own accord, rather than those that won&#x27;t compile because one of their dependencies is broken.  If one application depends on dozens of crates (or is just really large), the chances of it breaking somewhere are much higher.<p>This can be partially mitigated by the crates themselves releasing upgrades, but look at Python 3 - there will eventually be a <i>lot</i> of code out there that&#x27;s completely unmaintained, especially within the &quot;dark matter&quot; of internal or closed source applications.  Also, a fix in the latest version of a crate will probably not be backported to long deprecated major versions of it - which means that if I dust off a crate that hasn&#x27;t been touched in years and uses such a version, I&#x27;d have to either upgrade the dependency or do the backport manually.<p>And the ancestor post did say <i>five</i> years: last I checked on the lists, there was no real consensus as to when Rust 2.0 should be released, on a scale from &quot;in a year&quot; to &quot;never&quot;.  Maybe there is more consensus internally, but I&#x27;d be surprised if it didn&#x27;t happen in that long...<p>edit: It&#x27;s not an entirely fair comparison, but for what my ideal stability promise for a programming language would look like, one need not look very far - only as far as Mozilla&#x27;s <i>other</i> programming language.",1452638752

I have certainly never seen a way to get acceptable quality out of NVENC in common consumer game streaming software like OBS, and I&#x27;ve tried at length including adjusting profiles and tuning settings. It doesn&#x27;t help that NVENC&#x27;s documentation is atrocious.<p>NVENC also mishandles color spaces considerably (full vs limited range), which is a big handicap to begin with.<p>SSIM and PSNR aren&#x27;t really the question here either, the issue is totally perceptual. I do not doubt that on a speed basis NVENC is competitive or outperforms, the question is simply whether you can deliver something watchable that hits under the user&#x27;s upstream cap. If you look at average twitch streams of even mundane video games, many of them are borderline unwatchable - this is a pervasive problem :-) Kicking butt on image-wide SSIM and PSNR won&#x27;t be much use if all the text in a story-driven game is unreadable due to artifacts.",1452638075

If you were a Roman citizen out on the town with your buddies, you wouldn&#x27;t peel off one at a time to use a washroom.  You&#x27;d all sit down together on a public urinal and keep the conversation going as you dropped your deuces.  Many Roman houses did have toilets, but they were usually in the <i>kitchen</i>, of all places!  This flies in the face of modern notions about sanitary food preparation, but also in the face of privacy. If you were Roman, taking a dump was, more often than not, done in full view of others.<p>One thing that really is mind-bending about the ancient Romans is their total lack of privacy.  You went to toilet in public, with friends.  You went to the toilet in your home as your slaves prepared food around you.  You had sex with a slave standing over you in case you got thirsty and needed to send for water.  Being alone for any reason was a totally foreign concept.  Slaves talk.  Anything you did was public knowledge in fairly short order.  For this reason, Romans also really didn&#x27;t have the concept of the self-defined man.  For example, donating anonymously to feel good about yourself was simply not done.  Who you were was what people thought of you.",1452638059

Compression isn&#x27;t just the mathematical accuracy of a signal when it comes to lossy algorithms as you know.

It doesn&#x27;t appear to provide any detail on why it thought something was fraud.<p>So it seems to leave two choices:<p>- Allow stripe to decline things, and try to address false positives manually. There is no &quot;go ahead and charge this button&quot;, by the way...you would have to contact the customer.<p>- Set stripe not to decline things, but lose even the limited visibility to &quot;stripe would have declined this&quot;.<p>The real problem, in my mind, is that fraud risk for both the banks and providers like Stripe is really small.  You risk very little.<p>The vast majority of the cost goes back the individual merchants/sellers, who have the least visibility into what the risk of an individual transaction is.<p>Thus, there&#x27;s very little incentive for the banks, or stripe, to provide decent tools.

But we&#x27;ll table the discussion of whether or not I should be required to build my own CMDB from scratch or not for now...<p>The Chef Server stack is somewhat complicated, though with an omnibus install you will rarely have to interact with it  at that level. These days, it scales well up to thousands of client nodes with no meaningful effort.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by the server using its own versioning.  Cookbooks are versioned, as they are deployable artifacts.  Environments then define which versions of all the cookbooks exist, so you have an easy promotion strategy.  The challenge with Chef Server and DVCS is that you have to centralize the uploading of Chef artifacts (roles, environments, data bags, cookbooks) to Chef Server if you have a team with more than 1 person.  That challenge is not unique to Chef, however.  Hopefully, a team of Ansible users are not running Ansible playbooks directly from their workstations.  If you try to upload a version of a cookbook that is older than the current version, it yells at you, so it makes certain bad behaviors more difficult.<p>There is plenty I don&#x27;t like about Chef.

The blog entry felt very religious in proving someone defined as ""deflationists"" wrong, so I didn't think much of it.<p>I am very much interested in open government data so I wondered how much of the financial data is actually available from the Fed in its raw form.<p>It started as me wondering how full of shit this guys is and turned into five to six hours of trying to understand the raw data that is readily available from the Fed online. Their website is surprisingly good.<p>What I saw did not make me happy. The Feds actions resulted in an EXPONENTIAL increase in monetary base of our economy: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_base"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_base</a> Note that all I did is plot the numbers that the Fed supplies: <a href=""http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/2792/44768686.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/2792/44768686.png</a><p>It seems that all those ""bad mortgages"" that the Fed bought were not bought with ""debt."" The Fed bought them with freshly printed bills. Go on the Fed's website and download the data for yourself, don't take my word for it. Regardless, I dismissed my findings as ""I don't actually know what I'm doing"" and forgot about it.<p>This article however is absolutely in line with what I saw happening from the raw economic data, so it makes me wonder. We _did_ print exponentially more money than we have ever done before.

I can't imagine the Fed being able to take that much money out of circulation in nothing less than years. I also can't image how that could not be a very bad thing.<p>Another thing that I saw is a rather sharp increase in how much banks are keeping in reserves since the Fed now guarantees interest on reserves. <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081006a.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/2008...</a><p>All this money in reserves has nowhere to go but into the economy once banks start spending it. It also pisses me off that our banks were essentially given a lot of money (when you see a doubling of money in the economy, thats a lot) for them to sit on and for us to pay interest on it!<p>I am failing to understand the Feds plan.

Unfortunately, few nonprofits do that.""<p>Oh really?  So he can cite research that says, for example, that only x% (where x < 50%) of nonprofits with an annual budget of $500k have ever done any sort of evaluation, either comprehensive or more basic?<p>His assertion may be true. But just throwing this out there with absolutely nothing to back it up, in a blog post titled ""The Trouble With Nonprofits"", is frankly insulting to me.<p>I spent > 4 years working in a technical role for a nonprofit, and I can assure people that measurement and evaluation were very much on the minds of staffers.  Everyone (funders, management) was becoming more data-driven, so our organization got a grant to conduct a multi-year evaluation. It was a very positive and necessary process, and the results were very positive.  Like Aaron, I definitely recommend some sort of measurable goals for most every nonprofit out there.<p>I don't take issue with his opinion. What I take issue with is the tone of the article.<p>For example: ""...but an actual attempt to measure how much they’re improving people’s lives.

I should know; it's the attitude I had before I started working at a nonprofit.<p>Truth is, running a nonprofit can be a hell of a lot harder than running a for-profit.  At any stage, you have all the issues that for-profits have - hiring, firing, managing employees, management issues, getting money in the door, technological problems - PLUS a whole other layer.<p>A lot of this other layer comes because of the weak link between financial health and results.  Am I accomplishing my mission?  How do I measure success?  How do I maximize success based on dollar spent?  How do I judge where to allocate capital or resources - when maximizing revenue isn't a goal?<p>Why am I wasting my time writing this?

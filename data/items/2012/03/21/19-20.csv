What I think he misses though is the long game and how I think Elop is thinking about this business:<p>- Windows 8 is adopting elements of Metro, the UI interface in Windows Phone.  People will start being exposed to it and reports from Windows phone users suggest if people give it a try, they tend to rate it well so maybe people will be more open to Windows Phone in their consideration set.<p>- Imagine Windows Phone integrations with the PC or laptop in a much more seamless fashion, maybe there's some synergies there.<p>- How about the easiest way that MS knows to gain immediate market share in new territory: bundling.  Package every Windows 8 upgrade with a certificate redeemable for a free Windows Phone.  This market share boost will charge their app marketplace and they should further juice this with higher margins and lower commissions than Apple because right now, profitability can take a backseat to market share and growth.",1332359974

The right to pursue a profit exists as long as the law of the land allows it.<p>Markets already provide a ""pay-what-you-want"" model, it just happens that not everyone is willing to accept what you want to pay.<p>Selling capital goods is very different than selling digital copies of something.  There is a limited amount of corn in the world, you can purchase it at the going rate generally set by the supply and demand.  In digital goods, the supply is unlimited, there are no natural market forces.<p>Apple heavily protects its products with patents and copyright where it can.  You cannot take an ipad design and improve upon that design without cutting a deal with Apple.  I think that strongly supports the case that the few (Apple) benefit from the current system while the many (anyone who thinks they could enhance the design of ipad) do not.<p>There are, however, a few open and free items of software, Linux, MySQL, Apache, Firefox to name a few.  Arguably, depending on what you want to do, there isn't even a better closed alternative (yes, yes, substitute whatever SQL package you prefer for MySQL).<p>I personally have a cable provider (so I pay for the minimal tv package to get internet), a netflix account, Amazon Prime, see the occasional movie in the theater, etc.<p>When people talk about copyright though, I generally see some stuffed suit making a bonus, not a bunch of creative people.",1332359942

3736278,story,,,3,10,loeschg,"Ask HN: Is this a normal developer hiring/recruitment process?",,"I am a software developer about a year out of college, and I'm not exactly experienced in the realm of ""technical"" interviews (I wasn't overly picky about my first job...). I'm hoping somebody can help me figure out whether what I experienced is typical or not. This may very well categorize me as ""ignorant""... hopefully not.<p>I was recently contacted by a small startup company in the Bay Area (found me via LinkedIn) looking to hire a web application developer. I'm currently employed at a reputable big company, but the idea of joining a startup and playing a bigger role in the creation/creative process was (and still is) pretty appealing. I figured there was no harm in at least continuing with the process.<p>The first thing they wanted me to do was send them some source code. I understand that to be completely normal. I sent them a few domain, controller, and service classes from a web app I had created. They said it looked good and wanted to move forward.<p>Next they asked me to complete a coding challenge that required creating a web app (in a week's time period) that has functionality similar to Twitter's primary services... user creation, message posting, user following, displaying all the messages from users being followed, etc. They required some portions of Ajax as well. They asked for the app to be hosted on a server, and they wanted to see the source code. They requested Java, Spring MVC, and mySQL. Pretty typical. I asked if Grails would suffice. They said yes. Cool.<p>I thought the ""challenge"" was interesting and went about working on it during my free time outside of the day job. Upon finishing it up, I deployed to a home server and sent them my github link.<p>A few days later I got a response asking if I could have completed the challenge ""without using any ruby code"" which was weird since there's no ruby in Grails. Maybe a common misunderstanding... Rails... Grails... sounds similar. I emailed them hoping to clarify things, and I have yet to hear back from them (been a couple weeks).<p>So is that sort of coding challenge common for software interviews? I feel like I may have been conned into doing some free work... having just thrown them the source code and all. I mean it wasn't a ridiculously complicated application, but it definitely would take some know-how to get it done.<p>So am I stupid for just sending them the source code? Am I stupid for thinking they'd use what I created (ego check)?",1332359719

Anything you can't force people to pay for has no market value. Making a normative statement about whether people should have to pay for something based on market value is begging the question.<p>It's more important to think about utility, because that can help us answer the question of whether the government and laws should be used to create market value where there is none by trying to make a good excludable.",1332359697

3736266,comment,3735874,3735874,2,0,instakill,,,"<i>So what's the future for Rails? If you talk to the likes of 37Signals and GitHub, it's pjax and server side rendering. This involves fetching a partial of HTML from the server with Ajax, updating the page and changing the URL with HTML5 pushState.</i><p>I really hope not. Rails is awesome and I love it to bits, but I will hate to have to use a framework that is massively invested in Ajax/Pjax. The reason for this is simple: UX. Companies don't seem to understand that there's more to the world than just America and America's top-notch Internet [1]. A lot of web traffic comes from places where the connectivity is simply shit and interfaces like Quora, GMail, Twitter et al that have so much functionality with server-side JavaScript as a prerequisite make it seriously difficult to have an enjoyable experience more often than not. If you've ever tried to access Google Analytics on a 1mbps shared connection in a relatively populated office, you'll know what I mean.<p>Yes of course Ajax and the interactivity and convenience it offers are awesome, but they come at a massive expense, and this is something that will be very saddening if Rails starts considering it as a major part of its core sooner rather than later.<p>[1] Alright so it's not just America, but my point stands.",1332359559

However, as I showed in my video example, iTunes (and many other companies) have already addressed this issue, they have solved the convenience part and people still pirate, which shows (to me at least and I would hope everyone else) the issue is NOT acquisition of content or convenience, it's saving money.<p>Also no I don't think people should be punished more harshly for media piracy, I don't ever want to try and comment on the proper legal approach because I don't understand enough about the law to do it properly, but my basic thoughts on media piracy have been previously outlined here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3694764"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3694764</a><p>Piracy happens in most cases because it's FREE, this is the #1 reason, the fact that Spotify etc. are finding success should be the absolute proof: Spotify is free (or cheaper, if you pay for a subscription) than purchasing music, that's why people use it. Convenience is not a valid or relevant reason for (most) media piracy any more. There are <i>some</i> cases (such as acquiring the entire discography of an artist or group, which can't be done easily through any pre-existing product) which makes piracy more convenient, but the common use case of media acquisition (a single song or an artists latest album) is not part of the convenience.",1332357968

Perhaps there is only a right to pursue profit by live performance. But what happens if <i>that</i> becomes copyable? We already have at least one instance of a holographic singer (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku</a>). What if holographic recorders and projectors become as cheap as cameras and microphones and screens and speakers? Live performance could be copied about as effectively as live sound is now (recorded music is not a perfect reproduction of what was played in studio or on stage). What then?<p>Is there no right to pursue profit by live performance either? Decreasing costs of production seem likely to make copying merchandise reasonably possible (you can already just draw a design and have someone print a T-shirt or such for you). So is there no right to pursue profit by merchandise either?<p>If there is no right to pursue profit by distribution, live performance, or merchandise, I think it is safe to say there is no right to pursue profit at all.

Why won't we pay $129 for Kickstarter projects that sound interesting to us if pay-what-you-will really works?<p>Similarly, the most advanced synthesizers, digital mixers, even music software are all produced to be sold.

They trained readers to be shallow and emotional, to skim for the high level details and ignore deeper analysis, to be easily swayed by cheap ""human interest"" reporting. They sold themselves out to national chains and ignored the interests of their community.<p>And now we are supposed to feel sorry for them?<p>Newspapers have always been sort of a sham. Propped up by the fact that for centuries it was an enormous challenge just to get any sort of information from beyond the horizon, let alone accurate or timely information. The bar has always been low, and it has always been easiest to skate by on doing little more than repeating what someone else has said but putting it in a nice little easily consumed package (length, writing style, format, etc.) But the barriers to information dissemination have fallen, fast and decisively. And now all of the access, publishing infrastructure, and tricks of the trade that kept the newspapers rich in the past are useless.<p>In the end it's not a bad thing. There has always been a very profound and wide reaching problem in that journalists have as a rule, and especially toward the last half of the 20th century, been trained in that abstract subject of ""journalism"". A reporter is a journalist first and then has some specialty as a minor side note to their core competency of generic journalism. The big problem with that is that journalism is not actually that hard. But elevating it to such a high level diminished the importance of ""secondary"" knowledge in a reporter, such as expertise in the subject they are covering. We've all been witness to the problems this creates. The ""science"" reporter can barely understand the subject their covering and they routinely make errors which significantly damage the quality of their reporting. That problem has been endemic to journalism for decades.<p>Journalists who know a lot about the business, how to format a story, how to write a hook to get people interested, but who are as ignorant of the subject matter as a high school sophomore tasked to do a surprise report on a country they've never heard of. Yes there have been exceptions, in rare cases there have been reporters who were experts or who had a strong knowledge of the material they covered, but outside of sports reporting this has always been the exception. Because the difficulty of getting the story out to people in a format that was accessible was primary.<p>The value of the specialty skill of ""journalism"" is far, far less important today due to modern communications technology, making the very significant and real short-comings of traditional journalism all the more glaring.<p>Sorry reporters but I think your days are ultimately numbered. The ideal future I see is one where experts learn how to communicate, not where communicators learn how to fake looking like experts. If you want to be a part of that future I suggest going back to school or otherwise spending a lot of time becoming an expert on something important other than how to arrange letters into a 2 inch wide column.<p>P.S. Another enormous problem is that the media has become part of the establishment, and has blatantly fallen down on its job to challenge the establishment and report on the key issues of the day instead of merely serving up infotainment and pablum.",1332357397

Heck, many restaurants strategically vent exhaust from the kitchen to get more people to notice them. They are paying to distribute the smells for free yet not charging for them! (A fact the author asserts would strictly result in a reasonable charge for the aroma).<p>Similarly, the recording people have regularly paid big bux to radio station to freely distribute the music. The exposure gets a song popular, hence more sales. Yet, instead of looking at an even greater chance for big exposure, the industry is looking to clamp down on it.

3736009,comment,3735039,3735252,64,0,trevelyan,,,"The reason there are two passages through what seem to be limbo is that Inception is Christian allegory. If you look at the structure of the film you can see Nolan using the opening and closing heist sequences as allegorical bookends to demonstrate Cobb's character development. In the first Cobb is a faithless and money-oriented thief who embraces violence and selfishly abandons his team when this fails (""every man for himself""). At the end Cobb takes a ""leap of faith"" when he rejects Mal, whose seduction of him is framed as a temptation of faith (""you don't believe in one reality anymore.... so choose to be here""). Cobb reaffirms his faith in his children ""up there"", rejects violence even when he is attacked and then sacrifices his own life to save Saito.<p>So you're not supposed to worry too much about the logic of the dream levels, since all dreams are basically metaphors for life: mazes where people ""get lost"" and from which they need to ""die to wake up"". The only thing that makes limbo <i>special</i> is that it is particularly symbolic. Nolan is presenting a metaphor of life itself as a Penrose staircase, and portraying faith as the way out. When Ariadne shatters the mirrors that trap Cobb in a recursive chain, the image is symbolic: she is a gift from Cobb's father (""ask and ye shall receive"") and her role in the film is to guide him out of the maze that is the mortal world. This is presumably why she is the character who accompanies him to immigration.<p>For more evidence that this is intentional, look at the overwhelming creation imagery and the narrative emphasis on father-son alienation and reconciliation (with Fischer as with Cobb). Look at the curious way Michael Caine seems to be playing God when he shows up in Paris. And then look closely at the ending, which shows us neither a dream nor reality. What Nolan presents is symbolic: we see Cobb's judgment and forgiveness of sins at immigration, and then his reunion with his family in the heavenly garden. The film closes with Cobb ignoring his totem (as a crutch of faithlessness it is no longer needed) and then his son James (who represents faith and like his sister shares an apostolic name) telling him that they are building a castle on a cliff.<p>A what? That last bit circles back to the opening shot of the children on the beach. It is a bookend reference to Matthew 7.24 and the parable of the wise and foolish builders. The contrast (beach -> cliff) reinforces Cobb's character journey while telling us that the ending is NOT a dream (something reinforced by the lack of the water imagery associated with the other dream levels). It also reinforces the parallels Inception creates between the buildings of limbo and the sandcastles on the beach, and explains why all are ultimately washed away by water just as death washes away life in the Christian parable.<p>Brilliant movie.",1332357054

3735946,comment,3735388,3735388,2,0,wisty,,,"I'll just recycle my comment I made on the PG's article:<p><i>PG seems to be advocating a pragmatic approach, based on the difficulty of enforcement. Goods can be excludable or non-excludable. Excludable goods are anything that can be effectively locked down (like most physical goods, or movie tickets). Non-excludable goods can't (like air, fish in the sea, and IP). You can make a non-excludable good excludable by creating laws (like Carbon Taxes or IP laws), but it's not always practical.<p>But he kind of misses the other half - rivalry.<p>Goods can also be rivalrous or non-rivalrous. Ideas are non-rivalrous as you don't lose anything (except a competitive advantage) if other people also have it. In fact, IP may be the opposite to rivalrous (which is a rare enough thing to not have a name, though I like the name ""network goods""), because it's worth more if everyone has it. If more people can speak a language, it's more useful to everyone. The Lord of the Rings is more interesting if you can talk to your friends about it.<p>While there's a good reason to try to make common goods (rivalrous but non-excludable) goods more excludable (by introducing laws which prevent over-exploitation), it's perverse to make non-rivalrous excludable. You don't tax breathing if there's plenty of air.<p>The main reason you want to make a public (non-rivalrous non-excludable) good more excludable is to incentize its creation (another reason might be because it's judged to be a ""de-merit"" (bad) good - such as a porn or a method of manufacturing weapons). But since IP is an input to creating IP, there's very good reasons why you want to make copyright and patents expire in a short time - bringing down the cost of creating new IP may outweigh the lost incentive. Also, the anti-rivalrous nature of IP may even encourage people to make more, simply because it's so useful have more people using it - Linus got his own private kernel debugged and extended at a lower cost by sharing it.</i><p>If a good cannot be easily made excludable, then it's all very sad (assuming that the lost incentive to create more of it outweights the loss from more people having access to the existing stuff, and the stuff that's made voluntarily) but there's not much you can do without heavy regulation.<p>Music will still be made. Musicians will make money on gigs. Advertisers will pay musicians for annoying jingles. It's not the 1700s, there's literally millions of talented musicians who will eke out a living actually connecting with the community (concerts, teaching, playing in pubs) who should be able to produce far more (in aggregate) than Mozart, Beethoven and the like. Without copyright, many of those musicians may make a <i>better</i> living, as they can draw on other people's material more easily.<p>The fat distribution pipe (distributors, promoters, producers, broadcasters) will mostly die, but no-one really cares - they don't create much value. OK, the definition of value is rubbery, but if you make money by convincing people that they need something (i.e. tell them that folk music is daggy, and you have to buy the latest pop hit to be cool) then you're really <i>destroying</i> value, then offering a band-aid.",1332356490

The only reason that music is pirated now (when it used to be purchased) is because it's easy and without consequence.

Of course it doesn't.

I don't want a government sufficiently powerful (per the RIAA) to stop it, such powers would would themselves be a serious danger to society.<p>I suppose that amounts to a freedom to piracy.  But that doesn't mean piracy is somehow right, or even intended.  It's an injustice, of individuals, persisting in the space needed to maintain a free society.<p>Nor am I much impressed by the argument that with so many people pirating, it must actually be moral.  Probably most of them think it's moral, given that they take their norms from the people around them.  And the offenses are largely minor.  But I think the steps from principle to copyright are pretty clear, and I don't see how anyone concludes that it's actually right.<p>It's like littering: no one actually thinks it's okay, but they do it because it's convenient, they won't get caught and it isn't a big deal.  The consequences of those calculations are obvious.",1332356421

In the case of OMGPOP, which had received a ton of VC funding and struggled for years until finally finding some success, I can definitely see why VCs would want to force a sale. (In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if VCs generally think that ""make games for iOS"" is not a business model that is capable of the kind of returns they need anymore, and they want to avoid taking further risk on that modelhence they forced the sale.)",1332356413

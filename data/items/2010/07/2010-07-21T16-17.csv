(The Little Schemer, too, but CAE doesn't get much attention.)<p>Sterling and Shapiro's _The Art of Prolog_ is also excellent, though you'll probably be better off reading _Clause and Effect_ first if you've never used Prolog. CAE is all about getting a feel for how Prolog operates, step-by-step* , while TAoP is about the logic programming paradigm, interspersed with project case studies and comparisons between Prolog (as an LP implementation with various compromises) and ""pure"" LP.<p>* This is the main thing it has in common with The Little Schemer: both begin by stepping through their respective languages' evaluation at a micro-level, until the semantics feel totally clear. This is especially helpful since Scheme and Prolog are both very different from the typical imperative/OO languages people know.<p>FWIW, <i>The Little MLer</i> is written in the same style as TLS, and is a good, lightweight introduction to ML's type system / static typing.",1279731523

1535737,comment,1535681,1535681,0,0,mindcrime,,,"From what I've seen/heard, I think the lack of cheap hosting was one of the biggest things that kept Java from catching on as a preferred platform for the kinds of webapps that you see people building with PHP and/or RoR.  That problem has, IMO, been mitigated somewhat by the emergence of cheap VPS providers...  now hosting is hosting, and what you run on your server is entirely up to you.  But by the time cheap VPS's became commonplace, it had become ""cool"" to hate Java.  And, to be fair, there is a little more of a learning curve to get started with Java and most of the Java based webapp stacks, compared to, say, RoR or whatever.<p>Also, to be fair, other platforms have ""caught up"" to what were some of the early advantages of Java.  For example, at one time I would have cited JMS and the easy accessibility of async messaging from Java as a big advantage.  But now there are a bazillion messaging systems and most (if not all) of the major ones have easy to use client libraries in Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.<p>OTOH, Groovy/Grails brings a lot of the advantages of a RoR type framework to a JVM based ecosystem, as does Rails on JRuby, so more and more things are evolving to where the various platforms are approaching parity.",1279731445

He only touches on some of the problems with the site.<p>Let's take the bright orange banner at the top of the screen that appears only to new users.<p>Obviously, it's not just new users that see it. It's anyone who hasn't got a cookie on their browser indicating they haven't closed the ugly bright orange banner before, so it's hitting plenty of people who know this information already.<p>But let's ignore that, and ask whether it does the job: how useful is the information contained in the big ugly bright orange banner to new users? Not very, I suspect. For most users, the purpose of the site will be implicit - from context (because they did a search for their problem and were linked to it), from the design (it looks like a Q&A site), and from the content (questions and answers). If it's not implicit, then the exact same information is explicitly stated in a box on the right-hand-side of the site. No other popular modern site on the web does these sort of popups anymore, so I don't see why the creators of Stack Overflow thought they were a good idea. In addition, why does the big ugly annoying bright orange banner link to the FAQ? What pecentage of new users will ever want, need, or read the FAQ? Users don't read <i>anything</i>. If the idea is to encourage sign-ups, then create a sign-up link, not a link to something nobody will read.<p>Then there's the functionality of the big ugly annoying intrusive bright orange banner. It loads after the rest of the page loads, then shifts all the elements of the DOM down. Just in case you'd missed the bright orange banner that distracts you while using the site, it scrolls with you, displaying on all Stack Overflow pages until you're forced to go out of your way to move your mouse to close it (with their weird 'close' icon), when finally (if you're near the top) it shifts the DOM up again, just to ensure it can be maximally irritating.<p>I don't see how ""youâ€™re seeing the one-time new user screen layout"" should be regarded as any sort of defence for the big ugly annoying intrusive distracting irritating bright orange banner. Do new users somehow deserve bad design and bad functionality?<p>In my eyes, Stack Overflow has firmly been a success <i>despite</i> its poor design. It's not as though Experts Exchange set a very high bar to beat usability-wise.",1279731162

The article was very light on details.  What they're claiming is already facilitated by libraries in many existing languages (including Perl 5)<p>Generally, the barrier to entry for designing and implementing your own language is not the difficulty of understanding how lex and yacc work, it's the need for a thorough and precise understanding of the DSL and every step of the compilation process.  Error checking, for example... It's understanding what the compiler knows about your program, and what you can do to figure out things about the program, and how expensive that figuring is going to be.

At 500 iterations it runs smoothly.  At 50,000 iterations, it becomes non-functional.

I'm wondering why there seem to be only a small minority of webapps (at least not enterprise ones) being built using JSP technology.
Most articles and posts I see on HN seem to be webapps built with other technologies but Java.<p>JSP web apps can be built quickly as well. Eg. you have the JSTL tag library, and orm frameworks such as MyBatis or Hibernate. And there are also other things for simplifying, decoupling and modularizing a webapp like the Tiles framework, Struts, Spring MVC frameworks etc.<p>Now, I know for a fact that there are some other advantages php or rails apps have, particularly the lower price of hosting and possibly smaller memory requirements, but I'm wondering if there are any other reasons that JSP/Servlets/Java based small webapps are such a small minority and why adoption seems to be rather low for small to medium web 2.0 apps.",1279730498

I was pleasantly surprised how fast I could find question that was asked and after confirming that the asker has similar problem to mine how fast I could browse through responses. Also I could get to know reservations other user had to responses (stated in comments to those responses). I shouldn't probably be surprised by my amazement because the thing that recurrently cropped up in my search result in old days was experts-exchange.<p>After multiple visits I finally got curious what is that site that helps me so often and I clicked link in the orange banner on the top that drew my attention. Up to this moment the only parts of the page that I've noticed were, questions, answers, comments and banner on the top.<p>After I registered and answered few questions I picked tags that interest me. They are visible on the right. Tags are for answerers not for askers. Tags visible to unregistered users are just cool unimportant bonus info similar to pageviews and they are placed in the bottom right when nobody even looks if he's not bored and exploring.<p>There are maybe some features that are not necessary, and some missing but what is important for me, no unnecessary feature ever got in my face while using this site.<p>As for the proposed redesign I think it's horrible.<p>You can barely see votes and up/downvote buttons that are very important for this site to work. If people can't find them and hit them less often more bad answers would be mixed with good ones.<p>User info is in prominent place and it is almost of no importance ~8k rep guy can give you bad answer. Votes on answer matter, not the rep of answerer. Also insane spacing around it immediately kills aesthetics of the whole design it might have possessed. I rarely see something that awful outside of works of beginner designers (and yes, also developers).<p>Putting main menu in the right top corner where are all the things that you don't usually care about until you want to search for something or log in is a bad idea. But I don't use this main menu all that much so probably it wouldn't hurt too much. ... Besides if you see input box in the top right corner what do you expect it to be? A spot where you can place your pizza order? Even if that box was empty as long as it looked as input box I'd have thought that this is serchbox and when I put some stuff there and hit enter site will be searched for occurrences of it.<p>Questions are just barely discernible from answers. Stackoverflow does this better but I'm not sure why. Maybe with spacing? Maybe by not discouraging you from reading it by putting it somewhere in the middle of gray background?<p>Only thing I think might be good in the redesign is exposing ""Ask a Question"". But I think SO does almost as good by surrounding this option with plenty of whitespace.<p>As a footnote:<p>Don't try to redesign how thing looks until you understand what it does.<p>""By developers for developers"" sometimes works.",1279730493

Lets not delude ourselves that we're at the cutting edge of new discovery.<p>And:<p>>Building companies, developing products, increasing revenue are all far more interesting to everyone.<p>But really, when was the last revolutionary product made? The last revolutionary way to increase revenue that was sustainable in the long run?<p>I've seen many revolutions in software, distributed version control for instance ie git, LLVM, gaming and visualization software, and hybrid synchronization systems such as unison. In OSS the 'As Seen on TV' type products generally don't see the light of day, they get buried and forgotten, it's only incorporate environments I've seen crappy interfaces using decrepit languages from the 90's, because those programmers have stopped, or never even started caring about programming. If they did they might take the initiative to fix up the program themselves.<p>As for the factory worker analogy, I think it's dead wrong. It's like saying anyone who ever designed a product is a factory worker. Programmers have to do a lot of design decisions, interop systems etc. Yeah if you're programming in Java, or making corporate program in programing lanaguage du jour you're probably not really innovating, like any part of life programming is self driven, for every Google there's a struggling business and for every git, there's a Java webapp for accessing an Access database.<p>Also if you think AI is going to obsoltete us in 50 years you're kinda pushing reality there. MS tried to make programming easy and accessible, look at every <LANGUAGE> in 24 hours book. They download MSVS and run through a bunch of wizards, that's about as much control and innovation as you get with a Java webapp that accesses an access database. Not only that but who's going to program all the new features into the the automation AI? When Intel releases a new architecture or something happens there's always gonna be a need for programmers to translate and incorporate data.<p>Essentially if what you said was true SIGGRAPH wouldn't exist. There's plenty of innovation going on in the software field, and plenty of talent, like every field there's a bunch of idiots, and plenty of talent.  If anything you made a great social commentary, people care only about money, the easiest way to get money is working in middle management.

I'm normally a PHP programmer, but have been playing with some RoR with MongoDB stuff.<p>My take on it coming from a regular LAMP is that RoR has lots of gems (packages) that are easy to install and use.<p>The code generators get you up and running really quickly, though I'm not actually a fan of most generators.<p>RoR applications have a rather specific structure. I think it is deeper than MVC, as there are naming conventions for functions, variables/collections, etc.<p>The structure is good because it is fairly easy to back-trace through somebody else's code to see what they've done.<p>What I'm finding really challenging is that there are so many small details that are hidden from the code.<p>For instance, in RoR, 'render'  is like an include file, but you don't actually have to type the name of the file or where it exists. Based on the naming schemes and structure of RoR it gets the variable/collection and file name because everything has the same name.<p>What I haven't found is a place where it explains what RoR is doing, so you know that when you have an error, this is why.<p>I think we are just supposed to blindly follow the 'it just works' mantra, which has never really worked for me with Apple, and I'm barely holding it together with RoR.<p>As far as documentation goes, it is tough to beat PHP. The documentation is really good, and the language/framework doesn't do the work for you, so you build a page, put something into the db, get it out, put it on this page, call it from that page, etc. You build your own structure so you know where things are and how things work.<p>The tutorials I've seen keep going through the very same basic stuff of getting RoR to build crud operations for you, or how to change a view. But getting into the meat of RoR is proving to be much more difficult.",1279729263

1535551,story,,,2,0,unwantedLetters,"Ask HN: Data Archive of Hacker News",,"I was wondering if anyone had prepared some sort of data archive for Hacker News. Something fairly simple, having the attributes id, title, url, user, score, last time score changed etc.?<p>I was thinking it would be an extremely interesting and valuable dataset.<p>I had some sample idea that I would like to try:<p>1. Is there a best time to post on HN? (I know this is very SEO, but I think it's an interesting question nonetheless)<p>2. It might be fun to cluster the data (perhaps all articles with score > 5), and see the top X articles in every cluster. I think that'll give you a wide variety of extremely good articles to read.<p>I know that this isn't the most enlightening or groundbreaking work, but I'm sure if we had the dataset, we would be able to come up with some interesting ways to analyze the data and come up with some nice results. (In fact, if anyone can think of some other interesting ways to analyze the dataset, can you post anyway, I'd like to hear them).<p>I was actually putting together a little script that scrapes HN and puts the data into a MySQL database, but that doesn't seem to be a good idea since it would hit the servers unnecessarily. Also, I'm not sure people would like me doing that.",1279728071

Thus new students who start by C, C++ dont have proper exposure to the concepts of writting multi threaded applications.
I guess it is single biggest argument against C++",1279728043

Ruby code is generally readable even to someone who doesn't know Ruby (there are some exceptions of course, as Ruby can be very terse in the right hands).<p>There are also a ridiculous number of gems that are easy to install and use. Need to do document classification? There's a gem for that (classifier). Need to access a database and want to do it through Ruby objects? There's a gem for that (sequel).",1279728017

I like the top flash bar - it's informative, but not when you're logged off, duh. I also usually search and view questions via tags, which are missing. It looks like a forum - I don't care WHO posted the answers, I don't need it in big ugly phpBB layout in front of me. In contrast, the points each answer has allow me to easily skim through the garbage to find good answers, for ""old"" content.<p>Nice try, but he needs to have a clue of <i>what</i> he's trying to design.",1279728010

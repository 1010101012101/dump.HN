10743939,comment,10736600,10742934,0,0,talideon,,,"> You can&#x27;t use tones to communicate things like irony, anger or doubt. You have to play on volume. You&#x27;re losing a lot of expressiveness and subtlety in the process.<p>That&#x27;s not unusual even in languages <i>without</i> tones. For instance, in Irish, you can&#x27;t use vocal stress to emphasise particular words like you can in English. Instead, you use a combination of changes in word order and emphatic affixes to convey the same meaning. No expressiveness is lost, it&#x27;s just that Irish uses as different mechanism to convey the same meaning.<p>My understanding of Mandarin and the other Sinitic languages is similar: they might not use the same mechanisms to convey such information as in English, but they certainly can convey them.<p>> Moreover, combining one character before (or after) another can change the meaning entirely. Adding a third one can again change things.<p>vent\ncon-vent\ncon-vent-tion<p>Mandarin is no different than any other language in this regard. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s writing system masks what we&#x27;d consider words in languages with alphabet-like scripts. Also keep in mind that the Chinese characters make use of punning, so sometimes those weird character combinations are simply very, very old visual or phonological puns.<p>[There&#x27;s a little bit of cheating in there, because the &#x27;vent&#x27; in &#x27;convent&#x27; is more like &#x27;ven-t&#x27;, but the principle still applies, and with some though I could find better examples. However, as mentioned, Chinese characters do rely on punning like this in places, it&#x27;s not a huge flaw in the example.]<p>> You can&#x27;t apply a Porter stemming algorithm for example; there&#x27;s no concept of stem or etymology (no apparently logical one at least).<p>There are a few reasons for that, but the main one is that Mandarin is a largely isolating language. However, to apply some equivalent of Porter stemming, you need to rely on there being a concept similar to a word in the language and its writing system, whereas Chinese characters are more akin to morphemes, so the concept of &#x27;stemming&#x27; makes no sense. Pinyin is another matter though.<p>> there&#x27;s no concept of [...] etymology (no apparently logical one at least).<p>There is, it&#x27;s just obscured by how divorced the written language is from the spoken language, which isn&#x27;t the case for languages with alphabets, syllabaries, &c.",1450270728

It took me a long time to understand Searle&#x27;s argument, because Searle conflates consciousness and intelligence and this confuses matters.   Understanding Chinese is a difficult problem requiring intelligence, but I don&#x27;t think it requires consciousness.<p>It is important to distinguish between &quot;understanding Chinese&quot; and &quot;knowing what it&#x27;s like to understand Chinese&quot;.    We immediately have a problem: knowing what it&#x27;s like to understand Chinese involves various qualia, none of which is unique to Chinese speakers.<p>So I&#x27;ll simplify the argument.   Instead of having a room with a book containing rules about Chinese, and a person inside who doesn&#x27;t Chinese, we have a room, with some coloured filters, and a person who can&#x27;t see any colours at all (i.e. who has achromatopsia).   Such people (e.g. <a href=""http://www.achromatopsia.info/knut-nordby-achromatopsia-p/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.achromatopsia.info/knut-nordby-achromatopsia-p/</a>) will confirm they have no idea what it&#x27;s like to see colours.   If you shove a sheet of coloured paper under the door, the person in the room will place the different filters on top of the sheet in turn, and by seeing how dark the paper then looks, be able to determine its colour, which he&#x27;ll write on the paper, and pass it back to the person outside.\nThe person outside thinks the person inside can distinguish colours, but the person inside will confirm that not only can he not, but he doesn&#x27;t even know what it&#x27;s like.   Nothing else in the room is obviously conscious.<p>A propos of the dog, this is the other minds problem.   It&#x27;s entirely possible that I&#x27;m the only conscious being in the universe and everyone else (and their pets) are zombies.   But we think that people, dogs, etc. are conscious because they are similar to us in important ways.   Kurzweil presumably considers computers to be conscious too.   Computers can be intelligent, and maybe in a few years or decades will be able to pass themselves off over the Internet as Chinese speakers, but there&#x27;s no reason to believe computers have qualia (i.e. know what anything is like), and given the above argument, every reason to believe that they don&#x27;t.",1450270050

Reading faster than people speak is a factor (much faster) and being able to skim and dive in where I&#x27;m interested, ability to bookmark, to cut-and-paste bits for my notes files and so on. Besides reading is a lot easier for me to stay concentrated on the content rather than listening to someone talking. Podcasting just isn&#x27;t for me, but I totally understand that there are people for who they are very useful.

10743810,comment,10739730,10743433,0,0,tommyd,,,"It is a shame that so few React-based libraries are on DefinitelyTyped. As the project I&#x27;ve been building had quite a short timeline, I&#x27;ve just been creating &quot;any&quot; type definitions for libraries which don&#x27;t have definitions (in an ideal world, I&#x27;d like to create and share a proper definition), which works but you lose type safety and auto-complete for these libraries. Not the end of the world but it allows more runtime errors to creep in.<p>On the Flow vs Typescript thing, I evaluated both for this project, and almost went with Flow primarily because at the time, I liked that Flow felt lighter weight (it is truly &quot;opt in&quot; unlike TS, and getting the TS setup right was quite hard work), and I was also put off by the overhead of having to write .d.ts files (now I can create an &quot;any&quot; definition for a library in a few seconds, but at the time found it all quite time consuming).<p>However, I persevered with Typescript in the end, as I felt that some of the features it offered over Flow were worth the extra effort - specifically, the editor/IDE support (Atom with Nuclide for Flow was really unstable for me and the autocomplete still didn&#x27;t compare to TS) and the fact that Typescript does a full compile of your code, so will pick up on things like mis-spelled imports, which Flow didn&#x27;t seem to.<p>Also, I found documentation for Flow (beyond the basics) to be quite lacking, and there didn&#x27;t seem to be as much community around it - for example, I just couldn&#x27;t work out how to get it to check React propTypes, which was a pretty important feature for me. Bit of a shame, as its type system actually seems more fully featured than Typescript&#x27;s (e.g. types are non-nullable by default), but TS&#x27;s type system is certainly good enough.<p>I&#x27;d say go Typescript at the minute if it&#x27;s a reasonably large greenfield project, but Flow might suit your needs if it&#x27;s something smaller (whether that&#x27;s in amount of code or in team size), or if you prefer the lighter touch/opt-in approach - for example, if you want to introduce it to an existing JS code base. I would definitely say it is worth the effort to go with one or the other, I&#x27;m not looking forward to going back to writing plain JS - having the compile stage makes refactoring in particular trivial, without the overhead of having to write loads of unit tests. In TS I&#x27;ll refactor constantly as I go whereas in a large JS app, it&#x27;s tempting to put off refactoring as you might miss somewhere and not know until it is QA tested (or the customer spots it is broken...).",1450268960

Their size and ergonomics call out for precision manufacturing, but the materials must be cheap and plentiful. The measure of a good pen is often its durability, which is difficult to test for in production. The purchasing chain is incentivised for cost not quality - most pens are not bought by their users.<p>I think this is an almost unbeatable combination - I think we&#x27;ll be shaking and scribbling cheap giveaway ballpoints for the forseeable future.

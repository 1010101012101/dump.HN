8815059,comment,8813373,8813373,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"Some comments as a fellow garage experimenter and physicist:<p>There are two experimental results which are presented.  The first is the generation of fringe patterns with the laser beam sent through the crossed fields.  The second is the force generated which is measured using a weight scale.<p>There is not enough detail available on the fringe patterns, which is too bad because it is the more interesting of the two results. First, there is no &#x27;before and after&#x27; picture, to see how much change in fringing occurred.  Second, nothing is mentioned about verification that the fringing effect was not coming from mechanical distortion of the display screen. It is not so easy to alter light beams using EM fields in free space, so if it could be shown that the light is actually being affected (with a better designed experiment), that would be cool.<p>The force effect is a mess, both in presentation and experimental design.  First of all, it appears that they are mixing experimental values with modeled values in their graphs and tabulated forces, and they don&#x27;t say which is which.  I don&#x27;t believe that they actually delivered 305 watts with their antennas and measured 559607.4 Newtons of force. That much force could lift a Abrahms battle tank, and is unlikely to be measured down to the tenth of a Newton. That appears to come from their exponential model. I do believe the 1.25 g up and 1.30 g down points at 5 watts were actually measured.<p>Static force measurement can be notoriously misleading. It is very easy to do (all you need is a scale) and it can be easily done wrong; wrong in the sense that the result may not be indicative of what you are trying to measure.  It is just too easy in a world filled with small forces to end up measuring something other than what you think you are.  I see no indication that they are not just measuring normal electromagnetic interactions, instead of a warp bubble. One way to fix this problem is to measure dynamic forces, where your effect must transfer a goodly amount of energy.  With static forces, you can easily turn 0.0001 J into a large force.<p>There are significant issues with the exponential model of the force.  Force x velocity = power, so if you find a way to generate exponential force from a power, at some velocity you will be generating more power than you use. Now, if you believe that your power is coming from the fabric of space, this might not be a problem, but it also means that your experiment should show this by operating at or above that velocity.  Velocity relative to what, you ask? Hey, it&#x27;s not my inconsistent hypothesis.<p>The biggest issue of course, is that the experiments are showing &#x27;something&#x27;, but there is no direct link to show that what they are showing is coming from the hypothesized warp bubble.  More control experiments are needed.  That is where you really learn where you are wrong, and hopefully where you are right.<p>I will say that for those of you who are focusing on the style of the presentation or how jury-rigged the experiments appear, you might see those things in poor science, but you also see that when someone doesn&#x27;t focus on presentation.  I doubt Pares expected this to end up on HN. I&#x27;ve done work that looked just as bad, and while I would want to clean it up before presenting it to the world, sometimes that is what simple experiments look like. When my friends ask me why I don&#x27;t share more of my experiments on the web, I can point to this discussion.",1419955027

I&#x27;m not sure if he would disagree with me, but I think a lot of it depends on the kind of person you are and the kind of problem you are solving. Some problems can&#x27;t really be solved well iteratively (voice-recognition and DSP for example), while others can. Similarly some people work better iteratively while others do not.<p>I think it&#x27;s similar to writing an essay in some ways. Some people sit down and think for a while, then write the essay in one sitting. They then make some minor grammar corrections and otherwise polish the essay before submitting it. Others (like me), sit down and write whatever comes to mind. Then they rewrite everything, and then they rewrite everything again, etc. Finally they have an essay that they are happy with, make some small polishing changes and submit it.<p>In the end, both approaches work fine for writing an essay, just like both approaches work fine for writing code. The key, when talking about speed and iterative development, is that the code isn&#x27;t finished when you have something that appears to work. You have to go back through and rewrite things, refactor, add additional tests and clean the code up.",1419954944

The author of the blog does have a point, and it&#x27;s not really wrong much, but I&#x27;ve come to the fairly strong opinion it&#x27;s an unhelpful thing to complain about publically. (Which is a slightly ironic stance, I admit.)<p>As a plant engineer, you&#x27;re going to have to part out and understand a system in its entirety at some point. And you&#x27;ll be rating bolts and nuts and greases and such to meet the specification you need. There are a <i>lot</i> of bolts to choose from. It&#x27;s the same for chips or components when designing a circuit: there are <i>lots</i> of transistors to choose from. For many tasks, many will effectively be interchangable. Sometimes you&#x27;ll need to be careful, and other times you&#x27;ll be working on a system where you&#x27;ll need to research the manufacturer to make sure they&#x27;re likely to be still in business in ten years.<p>But you&#x27;d never reasonably complain about the choice. Nor about all the regular folk just building a porch out of some wood and screws from Home Depot. You wouldn&#x27;t complain about a kid learning circuitry by plopping some random components from Radio Shack into a breadboard (which they&#x27;ll <i>never</i> move to a proper PCB). And I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d complain about millions of people interacting with software the same way. Learning to deal with the glut is as simple as going to a curated aggregator (Home Depot/Radio Shack) or becoming an engineer.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the sort of stuff non-programmers inflict on systems.  I&#x27;m not even talking about JS on the web, but like simple relay-equivalent ladder logic on heavy machinery.  It&#x27;s just as bad there. <i>But</i>. Work needs to get done, production needs to move forward, and craftsmanship is expensive and time consuming.

He was clearly a remarkable man and a great salesman, described by his colleague Henry Blackburn (whom I’ve had the privilege to meet) as “possessing a very quick, bright intelligence” but also “direct to the point of bluntness, and critical to the point of skewering.”8<p>> Keys launched his “diet-heart hypothesis” at a meeting in New York in 1952, when the United States was at the peak of its epidemic of heart disease, with his study showing a close correlation between deaths from heart disease and proportion of fat in the diet in men in six countries (Japan, Italy, England and Wales, Australia, Canada, and the United States).9 Keys studied few men and did not have a reliable way of measuring diets, and in the case of the Japanese and Italians he studied them soon after the second world war, when there were food shortages. Keys could have gathered data from many more countries and people (women as well as men) and used more careful methods, but, suggests Teicholz, he found what he wanted to find. A subsequent study by other researchers of 22 countries found little correlation between death rates from heart disease and fat consumption, and these authors suggested that there could be other causes, including tobacco and sugar consumption.",1419954653

The &quot;horrible hit&quot; is one you&#x27;ll have to eat either way. And if you&#x27;re baking the implementation details of your internal strings into your IO… god help your soul.<p>That aside, there&#x27;s not much of a horrible hit unless you&#x27;re preallocating the whole output string every time. Swift has iterators/iterables built in and I may be mistaken but I believe Swift does the sane thing and exposes noalloc iterable views, you&#x27;re paying for some bit-twiddling (for the transcoding itself) and stack-allocated int8/int16/int32. Not sure how good Swift&#x27;s compiler is, but I know Rust&#x27;s can turn such iterations into the equivalent of the corresponding C loop, there&#x27;s little to no overhead.<p>> In practice it feels much better to define a encoding for the platform<p>Why? What does that give you, aside from exposing broken implementation details as the type&#x27;s public interface and having unfixable string for a decade (see: Java and everything Microsoft, because they exposed strings as being O(1)-indexed UCS2 code units early on).<p>> Ideally, the encoding would be specified in the type - e.g. String<UTF16><p>That&#x27;s crazy talk, why would you encode the implementation detail of the string&#x27;s internal encoding in the type interface?

It&#x27;s about the culture of speed, and the whole notion that getting something working as fast as possible is the primary virtue to be encouraged. I see this viewpoint engrained in lots of the younger developers I work with today, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s their fault, and I don&#x27;t think it is something whose DNA we can trace back to the dot-com bubble.

That goes back at least to the early 90&#x27;s and maybe the late 80&#x27;s. I believe the reasons for this are more fundamental than these articles hint at.<p>The problem arises, imo, when you have management in a position of relying totally on people whose work they don&#x27;t understand at all.

8814938,comment,8813208,8813208,0,0,alblue,,,"I&#x27;ve been working with Cocoa for 20 years, back from the NeXT days. I certainly see where Swift is going, and there&#x27;s a possibility that it will surpass Objective-C in the future, but for the time being they will live together in relative peace.<p>Objective-C provides a number of patterns that aren&#x27;t available in Swift due to the dynamic nature. For example, transparent network proxies are possible in Objective-C using message forwarding techniques. Similarly, it&#x27;s possible to swizzle method implementations under the covers so that a replacement mechanism can be called instead. These don&#x27;t sound like much but they are used to implement some powerful mechanisms, like the observable patterns and key value binding that is built upon it.<p>Swift is really a much better C++ than a better Objective-C. The language is terser and the underlying compilation mechanism can perform more optimisations than C++ (or Objective-C!) can. For example, Swift has the concept of a module (aka framework) and the Swift compilation can provide module-visible functions that can be called between different classes but still be optimised at the module level (e.g. in-lined).<p>There are a lot of compromises in the language at present; it can fallback to generate an Objective-C class which then means that the Swift optimisations aren&#x27;t effective; and when data is passed from one layer to another it may have different performance characteristics (a built-in Dictionary will perform differently than an equivalent NSDictionary, even if they can be used in the same way).<p>A lot of the problems stem from the fact that Objective-C has grown over time, and itself has had new mechanisms added. Blocks were only added relatively recently, and so some APIs have support for callbacks with blocks, whilst older APIs don&#x27;t have block support. Those that do support blocks work particularly well with Swift, because you can have a trailing lambda(closure) and pass that in as a block; if it doesn&#x27;t then it involves writing a separate Swift/NSObject class that implements a callback interface, which increases the size of the codebase.<p>I would imagine that Apple will focus on the important things - like fixing the compiler/xcode bugs (they&#x27;ve got a lot of work to do there still) and introducing newer features/fixes (class members can&#x27;t be that hard...) before there&#x27;s an exhaustive overview of the APIs. That said, I think the existing APIs will largely do their own things (being looked after by different teams), perhaps adopting blocks where they are not yet present, but there would have to be a big shift away from things like UIKit in order to make a change.<p>Close observers will note the UI layer is already being abstracted with CoreGraphics (a C library) and Metal (a lower layer C library) so it&#x27;s not too much of a stretch to imagine a new UI layer written in Swift -- but Apple will keep that under wraps for a long time until it is baked.<p>Disclaimer: I published Swift Essentials (<a href=""http://swiftessentials.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swiftessentials.org</a>) and expect Swift to only grow from here, even though Objective-C was my first love.",1419953493

It&#x27;s perfectly practical - I know people working at big investment banks writing large scale software in Haskell, and they don&#x27;t have any issue with it. What it comes down to is whether the people you work with will understand or want to invest the amount of time required to learn those abstractions. If you&#x27;re working with very talented programmers, that might be yes. With the majority of programmers it is probably no.<p>But we&#x27;re not talking about the I/O Monad. We&#x27;re talking about generics, which are not difficult to understand, and that Go lacks them is a shame, as it means that whole layers of abstraction are not available to the programmer, so they end up having to spend more time writing boilerplate.",1419951948

But it&#x27;s a one-off both in terms of the company and your position and your other options.<p>Generally speaking, my opinion is that 1% equity is entirely worthless: not in the sense that to a first approximation all startup equity is worthless, but that it signals an unwillingness to share the value your employment adds to the company. A first employee, even a receptionist adds more than 2% to the value of the company, otherwise the person wouldn&#x27;t be hired.<p>To me, 1% equity is a symptom of finite-pie thinking; a symptom of Owners who believe that employees are costing them money. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s ok to work for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to make you rich. Just be aware that they are actively going about not making you rich.<p>To put it another way, the difference between 1% and 7% is nickels not 100 dollar bills. If the company exits at $100 million or more the large shareholders get rich either way. But until the exit approaches $1 billion, 1% doesn&#x27;t let you walk away with &quot;Fuck You&quot; money while 7% gets you close at the lower number.<p>Of course, 1% of $100 million is a nice payday. But 1% means that you don&#x27;t really have a seat at the table, and deliberately so. You will always be the hired help and less equity means you are cheaper to replace and it is easier to reduce the value of your equity to zero if the company is successful.<p>Good luck.",1419951890

From a technology perspective, I think a lot of people are greatly underestimating the gap between autonomous vehicles operating under relatively controlled conditions with a human available to take over control within a modest period of time and the general case. I.e., it&#x27;s easy for me to imagine autonomous cars being possible for highway driving in good weather in the relatively near term. But, unfortunately, I suspect robo-taxis are decades away.<p>And regulations will be slow to change as well, especially to the degree that autonomous vehicles are seen as toys for rich people. One of the issues will be that, even if they really are statistically safer overall than human-driven cars, they will tend to fail in ways that are different.

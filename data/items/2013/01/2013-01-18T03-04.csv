5077012,comment,5076866,5076866,6,0,orangethirty,,,"This is kind of scientific from an evolutionary stand point. The company is allowing males to setup a mating ritual display to appear more desirable. I don't know if its scientific, but my fisrt hand <i>experience</i> always had me being more desirable to the opposite sex when I was in a relationship. Now that I wear a wedding band around my finger, I could swear that the effect has increased. Which is quite funny at some times, but very uncomfortable at others.<p>But I wonder what purpose in the evolutionary side of things does the company play? Are they doing like some species that help others mate through their own mechanisms? Or am I just too tired from programming all day and writing endless babble?",1358481546

""If this script is unchanged as HBO begins production, it will be one of the worst pilots HBO has ever aired. The draft I read is dated mid October, so God willing Mike Judge (and other writers John Altschuler & Dave Krinsky) get their act together. Frankly, I had to re-read this twice to really take in just how God awful it is.<p>Even shorter review: Mike Judge drives through Silicon Valley. Once. He then fills a script with uninteresting stereotypes. It is not funny. At all.""<p>""This isn't Office Space humor of reality/biting sarcasm. This isn't Idiocracy humor of the absurd. It's like a drive by concept, that in execution lacks any semblance of humor, because the world they've created isn't believable and the characters they've populated in it lack any semblance of reality.""<p>link to full review: <a href=""http://www.aintitcool.com/node/60283"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aintitcool.com/node/60283</a>",1358481537

How do you discriminate between the two?<p>I've got a hard time trying to come up with something ""right"" because it doesn't feel like Aaron's access should really be a crime at all, and JSTOR can go for civil damages or criminal copyright infringement. And it also doesn't feel like we need a law to punish someone for using a computer while defrauding a bank, because we've already got a law for defrauding a bank that even gets applied when you do it in person. And to the extent that one can cause purely virtual destruction (and hence not have any physical world laws apply), <i>that</i> should be the thing that is addressed as the primary crime, instead of having a lone charge of something that is usually bundled on top of other crimes to punish harder.<p>What about punishment of cracking applying solely to damage done to the cracked systems (either categorically or monetarily, and possibly including something like your tests)? This would also put someone who successfully tries an sshd exploit and then emails the administrator <i>completely in the right</i> - something we've <i>never</i> had.

I think that was kind of the point of the original root comment and the supporting response by the parent, and seems perfectly valid to me comic notwithstanding.<p>On your second point, there's an enormous difference between saying ""I can't continue with the project, someone else want's it?"" and ""I can't continue, because of A, B, C...Z, someone wants?"". When you add the personal touch to a question it's inevitable that someone is going to answer with a personal experience. The same rhetoric you use can easily apply on the inverse case. Making unsolicited comments about you marriage life to a crowd of technologists/geeks/whatever should not be noble (whatever this means in this context anyways) either then. If the project developer didn't want advice about his married life, he should have kept his marriage troubles out of the spotlight.<p>In any case, there's one important distinction to make: Giving such marriage advice is worth it if at least one person that needs it reads it. The original poster probably didn't give marriage advice because of the odd chance the developer will read it; I mean lets be realistic here, the poster/blog-author is not the developer with marriage troubles, so there's no reason to believe the developer will read this. He most certainly did because maybe someone here in HN could be going through a phase in his/her marriage/relationship that could use the couples therapy, and publicly acknowledging the benefit it had for him <i>can</i> have an positive impact on someone that actually needs that advice and is browsing Hacker News instead of attending to his significant other.",1358481397

5076920,comment,5075609,5076052,1,0,wwweston,,,"> This will have about as much protective effect against the criminally-motivated as putting up ""gun-free school zone"" signs.<p>Even if what you're saying is true, one could argue that means ""some protective effect.""<p>Yes, it's probably true that someone who intends to ignore the law and most moral codes and commit a crime with a firearm will almost certainly ignore a sign and the associated additional legal penalties.<p>""Gun-free"" school zones are not really meant to address that problem. They're an attempt to address the problem of crimes/accidents committed with firearms brought into a zone <i>without</i> intent to commit a crime, but that end up being used criminally anyway in a confrontation or when they end up out of original hands, etc. Given that these things happen, restricting access to firearms in a place like a school probably has some marginal positive effect (you can credibly argue there may be a negative effect too -- not having <i>anyone</i> armed in a school represents a targeting opportunity -- but the intelligent response to this is probably to figure out what reasonable exceptions might be rather than throwing up your hands and letting any student or visitor carry).<p>Similarly, I think it's possible that making attempts to restrict the legal manufacture of high-capacity clips will have some positive impact -- probably a greater one, since the larger scope makes leaks through neighboring less-restricted zones less likely. It will remain true that where ""criminally-motivated"" means someone with resources and strong resolve, they will be able to acquire not only high-capacity clips but probably just about any form of contraband they'd like. It's also true that by placing restrictions on the process of making of high-capacity clips, the bar for sufficient resources and resolve will be at least somewhat higher: there will be fewer made, fewer people making/distributing 3D printable designs, introducing scarcity, making it harder to do.<p>Would this be an absolute deterrent? No. Some people will still do that. Is the lock on a door an absolute deterrent? No. It raises the bar: you need to be more determined and you face additional risk of being conspicuous while breaking in. Seat belts don't protect you from many risks of driving. Sometimes, making improvements in the margins is how you get things better.<p>Now, that's not to say that there might not be other problems with any given measure. Personally, I think if you're going to ban manufacture of something, focusing on the method is probably a bad choice. There's also the question of tradeoffs -- what does it mean to ""ban"" 3D printing something? Does it mean every 3D printer gets a regulator or a monitor? That might be too big a cost for the benefit.",1358479800

Usually you won't need to peek under the hood, but at some point when developing nontrivial services, you always need to.  Basically my philosophy is that you should always understand at least 1 abstraction level below what you program in.  With either Go or Python, that's C.",1358478927

It is also my opinion that Aaron should not have been facing prison time. We have prisons overflowing with bad people that have caused far greater chaos and pain than Aaron. Aaron probably should have had a lengthy house arrest and a hefty fine. Maybe restricted use of computers, etc. And that very well might have been what he would have ended up with if he'd stuck it out.</i><p>Much of my vehemence in these discussions of the last week stems from the sheer magnitude of the onslaught that is standard practice for prosecutors.  If the law and its enforcers were more reasonable in this case, I'd find it much easier to be reasonable in response.  Instead, prosecutors seem to see fit to alienate a huge chunk of the population, spreading disrespect for the law (and, I guess, giving them more defendants to prosecute in the future).<p>I'd be perfectly happy myself, if I were Aaron, to publicly apologize, do some community service, and go on my way never to interact with JSTOR or MIT again, as this prevents the alleged harm that would have come to JSTOR with the minimum necessary imposition from the law.  But I would not be happy about being bullied by prosecutors.  I don't even see why house arrest should be ""lengthy,"" or a fine ""hefty,"" because in reality his actions had a minimal effect on MIT or JSTOR (bandwidth is cheap).<p>[0]<a href=""http://pastebin.com/cefxMVAy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/cefxMVAy</a>",1358478193

The likelihood that your business was going to die before you could pay all your debts was priced into your contracts. If you have employees, pay them and get them off your books first; employee wages are, depending on the state you&#x27;re in, the one likely exception to that rule.<p>* If they were in your name, well, that sucks, but still nobody is coming for your house. Your credit rating will probably absorb all the damage. I&#x27;ve had shitty credit all my life, so much so that it used to make it hard to get checking accounts (I&#x27;m not a deadbeat, I just don&#x27;t have revolving credit, and do have billing disputes that I don&#x27;t have time to resolve). Shitty credit is not that big of a deal. Just don&#x27;t use credit.<p>* It sounds like your wife is right. The existence of startups isn&#x27;t a guarantee that you&#x27;ll never need to work for someone else again. The normal life cycle of a startup founder is, (1) work for someone else, (2) start company, (3) run company into ground, (4) goto 1. Think of it this way: had your company been successful, it almost certainly would have left you in a state where you&#x27;d be working for someone else for a couple years during your earnout. &quot;Not working for someone else&quot; was never really on the table.<p>* Getting a company funded and then running it is a resume plus. You won&#x27;t have more trouble getting another job than you did getting the one you left to start this company.<p>* Your investors expected you to fail. The odds were always overwhelmingly that you would. The whole startup investment model is, put money into 10 companies, hope 1 succeeds. Your investors are professionals. Let their problems remain their problems.<p>* Are you going to get ridiculed for failing? Obviously, you&#x27;re not an HN reader. You&#x27;d have gotten ridiculed for succeeding. Ridicule is the air we breathe. Why do you care?<p>* Most small companies start from nothing. That&#x27;s good news, because &quot;nothing&quot; is an easy state to achieve.

7140418,comment,7139869,7139869,8,0,inconshreveable,,,"The thing that&#x27;s missing from this article (which is relevant to this crowd) is the incredible focus on simplicity of Keen&#x27;s API. Keen&#x27;s API for reporting metrics is the right one. Any Keen SDK has essentially one API call for reporting metrics:<p><pre><code>    keen.add_event(&quot;collection_name&quot;, {\n        &quot;arbitrary&quot;: &quot;dictionary properties&quot;,\n        &quot;with_any_type&quot;: -11.23\n    })\n</code></pre>\nFor developers accustomed to instrumenting their applications with various metrics libraries, this is akin to finding the holy grail. Most APIs for metrics collection require you to decide up front what metrics you want, whether it is a time series or a count or a gauge or a ratio. And even after you&#x27;ve figured _that_ out, there is a combinatorial explosion of different metric collections you have to create for every combination of filters that interest you.<p>For the developer, Keen&#x27;s API is so powerful because it lets you defer almost all of your &quot;question-asking&quot; until later (which is when you want to think about it anyways because you can never predict up front all of the questions you want to ask about your data).<p>When I began to evaluate options for monitoring ngrok&#x27;s usage and performance, Keen struck me both for getting the abstraction right, and because I have watched company after company dump countless amounts of money and developer time into homegrown analytics systems that materialize either too late or far over budget.<p>Disclaimers:<p>- I am Keen customer for ngrok.com (<a href=""https://ngrok.com/status"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ngrok.com/status</a>)<p>- Compelled by the power of their product, and the competence of their team, I now work for Keen.",1390949504

Adding two floats requires (at least) the larger of the two magnitudes because larger values are more important than smaller ones. So the smaller float essentially gets converted to a small quantity and a large magnitude. In an extreme case, this small quantity becomes zero. So when adding a very large number and a very small number, the result will be the same as adding zero to the very large number.<p>If you add numbers largest to smallest, then thanks to this, at a certain point you are simply doing $SUM = $SUM + 0 over and over.<p>But if you start with the smallest numbers, they have a chance to add up to a value with a magnitude high enough to survive being added to the largest numbers.",1390949457

Trust me, even if it really seems that way, it&#x27;s not.<p>For now, grit your teeth and go through the bad stuff. Tell your wife. Be honest with her. No matter what, she&#x27;s your wife for a reason- she&#x27;ll support you through all of this. If you neglected your relationship with her a bit because of the startup thing, then she comes first now. Then tell your investors. Tell your employees. Tell whoever else you need to tell. Be honest, genuine and straightforward. The next few weeks are going to suck big time, but you&#x27;ll get through them.<p>Once the big stuff is behind you, take a few weeks to breathe, if possible financially. You&#x27;re coming to the end of a long, arduous journey, and that&#x27;s always something hard to process. Try to find joy in the little things that you didn&#x27;t have the time for during your founder mode. Have brunch with your wife. Go take a walk alone in the forest. Read a book. Take time to recover.<p>You will find another job. You don&#x27;t realize this right now, but having run a startup for 2 years gives you more skills and experience than others have developed in a lifetime. If you have to take a job right away because of financial hardships, take something low stress (consulting/freelance could be a good choice, for the flexibility, although it can be hard to get started with no leads). Now is probably a bad time to do another startup. Also, you probably want to use this as a lesson to remember that you should always have ~6 months of expenditures in the bank that you NEVER touch precisely for situations like this one.<p>Don&#x27;t worry about the investors. It&#x27;s part of their job - you&#x27;re not the first startup that they funded that failed, and you&#x27;re not the last either. Be professional with them- if you want to do a startup again in the future they will remember your honesty and ethics more than the fact that your startup failed.<p>You ran a startup for 2 years. Solely by doing that, you&#x27;ve gone further on the path of entrepreneurship than 99.999% of people who call themselves &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; have. Take time to grieve, but also take time to see all that you have accomplished.<p>If you still feel depressed after a month or two, go talk to a professional therapist/psychiatrist.

7140385,comment,7139935,7140214,11,0,toufka,,,"As a researcher in the field, it&#x27;s a big question.  There are lots of answers.  Most of the time, the answer will be, &#x27;maybe, and maybe more if we can get it to the right place at the right time - but it&#x27;s often hard to know where/when that is&#x27;.<p>More specifically, and more concretely, there are certain kinds of cancers (and diseases/disorders) that this will be very effective against.  And some advanced iteration of this technology will be curative - entirely.  This is of an entirely different kind of medicine than bathing trillions of cells in a potent chemical in the hopes that one of those molecules might slow another molecule - somewhere.  This kind of genetic engineering would enable a biological feature to be entirely restored, changed, or removed.<p>Those cancers this will be effective against are those where a particular, knowable, and targetable gene has a known and particular mutation.  And this is actually a large class of cancers.  Cancers often initiate as mutations that destroy the elaborate series of &#x27;checkpoints&#x27; your body has instituted to prevent runaway growth. If one of those proteins that guards against runaway growth gets damaged, then there are far more ways to get cancer.  If you can repair that checkpoint (via (genetic) therapies), you can halt, slow, or even destroy what caused that (particular) cancer. The analogy of the cells in your body as a society is not a bad one.  And cancer, as a &#x27;criminal&#x27; is not particularly dangerous to the whole.  It only becomes dangerous when the police, the courts, and the military are also crippled.  And we have learned <i>a lot</i> about how those regulatory objects function in the past two decades. However being able to restore them or affect them in a living being has been orders of magnitude more difficult than simply watching to see what they do. It would be fair to say we know understand most of the key elements, and many of the details of their roles of what&#x27;s happening in the society of your body.  However making direct changes to that society in a living being is still tricky, and our tools blunt.  What you see here is the sharpening of these new tools - tools that offer the opportunity to restore (or improve) those regulatory objects to a broken system.<p>To say it another way - there is no way I could imagine a cancer to be &#x27;cured&#x27; by small molecules (alone).  Small molecules work great against &#x27;the different&#x27; - but by definition, cancer is not different from its host.  I think this is why the drugs of the 20th century were so ineffective against cancer while simultaneously so effective against parasites, bacteria and even viruses for the most part.  The only way I could (from first principles) expect to prevent or alter a process like cancer is using tools like the ones talked about here.",1390949223

So, why let them off the hook?</i><p>How does encouraging people to start competing businesses that treat employees better count as letting existing corporations off the hook?<p>Also, what alternative remedies would you propose? As far as I can tell from other comments in this thread (not yours), the main remedy appears to be to complain really loudly. If it&#x27;s not realistic to expect lots of people to start new businesses, it&#x27;s even less realistic, IMO, to expect complaining really loudly to make a significant difference.<p><i>I read at least a tinge of disdain for workers implied in your comment</i><p>Not disdain, just a reality check. I completely agree that workers at a lot of existing corporations should be dissatisfied with the way they are being treated. But I don&#x27;t see much potential for change in just complaining about it. What these corporations need is competition.<p><i>here we have to distinguish between small businesses and major corporations.</i><p>Yes, this is a good point. However, I would offer a slightly different take on it. Small businesses, in my experience (a friend of mine runs one), just want to do business; they don&#x27;t have the time or the resources or the inclination to expend effort in non-productive activities like playing political games. (That&#x27;s one reason I think society as a whole would be better off if the average size of a business were considerably smaller than it is now.) The major corporations are the ones buying the regulations. But that means that much of the &quot;protection&quot; that we as consumers are supposedly getting from those regulations is illusory.<p>For example, lots of people claim that the financial crisis in 2008 was the result of lack of regulation of the financial markets. But if you look at what actually went on, there was plenty of regulation; it was just regulation that the major investment banks had written to favor themselves, rather than regulation that was written to actually protect the average person from having their retirement savings invested in junk securities that were made to look like AAA securities. As far as I can tell, that situation has not improved at all.<p>So when I say there should be less regulation, part of the reason is that the regulations we have are useless anyway. Small businesses are too busy doing business to engage in the kinds of shenanigans the regulations are supposed to protect us from; and major corporations can manipulate the regulations so someone else pays the price for the shenanigans anyway. If it were possible to have regulations that really did protect us as they&#x27;re supposed to, I would be in favor of it; but I don&#x27;t think we can, at least, not the way our political system currently does it.",1390949055

And again, many Ukrainians would like closer ties to Russia.<p>>Moreover, any cultural identity does not exist in a vacuum. By your logic we can argue that the US has no identity of its own and is still just a breakaway British colony that is due to join the UK any day now.<p>The similarity is that the US and the UK have very strong relations, and a difference is that many hundreds of years have elapsed since the American revolution. But, similarly, during the American revolution, there were royalists, and a foreign power (the French) did intervene to defeat the British. The point is that many Ukrainians would like closer ties to Russia, particularly those in the East.<p>Also, why pick the US when you can pick Canada- the Queen still comes by to visit, we have a governor-general, we are part of the commonwealth, and so on.

The idea would be to build a sphere whose mass is very precisely known and place one clock near the mass and one clock far away.  By measuring the gravitational time dilation you could infer G.  As I recall from my order of magnitude calculations, atomic clocks would have to improve in accuracy by four orders of magnitude or so before this would be feasible.

Yes, SF&#x27;s housing market is crap, which is a combination of absurd laws and regulations plus demand.  Tech workers wanting to live there are helping on the demand side, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>As for disruptive industries, cherrypicking AirBnb and Uber isn&#x27;t representative of the vast majority of the industry.  Airbnb enables about 1/2 of its users to illegally sublet their apartments in cities like NYC.  And its annoying a lot of the folks out here.  But does that make other tech companies bad?  Uber, from various anecdotal insider reports, seems like a pretty shady company that tried to operate illegally in multiple cities but is being reigned in.  Does that make other tech companies bad?  King.com got absurd trademarks for their game designed to extract money from unsuspecting players and is now using those trademarks to inhibit competition.  But does that make other tech companies bad?  Yes, Apple price fixed the whole book publishing industry and Google bought and killed off multiple products people liked and Adobe costs too much and all three of them conspired to keep tech wages down.  And Facebook is an immense privacy-gobbling behemoth that won&#x27;t let you install their Android app unless you let them read your SMS messages.  But does that make ALL other tech companies bad?<p>Realistically, it&#x27;s a combination of the fact that some companies are now big enough to actually throw their weight around money/size wise the way other industries do --  Industries that get kickbacks, govt handouts, etc on things like corn and oil that most of America hates -- and the fact that the bad actors are getting a decent amount of press for their bad actions.  But that doesn&#x27;t make all tech companies bad.  Nor does it make the actors engaging in these actions all bad.  And it certainly doesn&#x27;t make the average wage earner at a company working for a living worthy of harassment.",1390946681

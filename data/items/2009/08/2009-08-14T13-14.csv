When I look at the web applications I use on a regular basis (Amazon, craigslist, LinkedIn...) I cannot think of a desktop app they have displaced. I cannot say, for example, that ""I stopped using desktop application X because Amazon is so much better"". On the other hand, my trips to the book store are less frequent because of Amazon. So I would argue that web applications are popular today because they are a convenient way for people to use a range of services traditionally offered by brick and mortar businesses.<p>Edit: I also don't understand why people bother building Photoshop ""clones"" for the web. If the goal is to clone an existing application and just move it to the web, what actual problem is being solved?",1250258162

I could go on line by line and show an incorrect assumption or just plain FUD (on <i>both</i> languages btw):<p><i>LISP's most-used datatype is the list, but strings are also a basic type, and dictionaries are supported to some degree through association lists.</i><p>FUD. Lists are not the most used datatype, at least by this Lisper, classes are. Dictionaries are supported <i>fully</i> as hash-tables. Association lists are usually written when testing stuff in the shell, but quickly made into a more robust datatype.<p><i>Documentation String .. Python has apparently copied this straight from LISP, as it has the same feature (also at the module and class levels)</i><p>Yes, same in Lisp. Classs and packages also take docstrings. I can't think of any top-level definition form in Lisp that <i>doesn't</i> take docstrings.<p><i>Exception Handling .. LISP can achieve a limited sort of exception handling through ""catch"" and related operators</i><p>Lisp has the condition system that inspired Aspect Oriented Programming. Lisp condition system is still the envy of everything else out there. People should really start learning things before they write authoritative texts on them.<p><i>Multiple Namespaces .. Multiple namespaces are central to Python; every Python module gets its own namespace, with a simple syntax (module.varname or module.funcname) for referring to objects therein. LISP packages are essentially equivalent to Python modules in this respect.</i><p>And he misses his chance to bitch about the one thing that's imperfect about Common Lisp :-P<p><i>LISP uses CLOS, which is a fairly (but not completely) standard object extension to LISP.</i><p>Was this written before 1994?

Of course there are many bad programmers who develop websites juts by reading a few ASP or PHP tutorials. But that cannot be generalized to say that all web programmers are bad.

Just remember that this is not a sign that all good programmers are in the desktop.  It just means that smart people tend to cluster around in places where other smart people are.

762988,comment,761767,762581,0,0,grellas,,,"Usually it is 2x.<p>Tax gets complicated in these areas but the general principle is that, any time founders or others need to vest shares, the IRS regards the value of those shares as <i>service income</i>, i.e., taxable income. That is why trivial valuations are used up front even though founders may in fact believe the value of their stock to be significant even right out the gate. Once founders permit any form of ""measurable event"" to occur - that is, any event (usually involving a funding but also can involve paying people in stock measured by the value of services performed) that gives the IRS a way of putting an objective value on the stock at a time when its value would otherwise be nebulous - then that measure begins to define potential taxable income to those who receive the stock after that event occurs.<p>So, if a founder gets 1M shares at $.001, and has to vest shares over 4 years, any taxable service income attributable to that effort is negligible ($1K) (assuming an 83(b) election is timely filed - <a href=""http://www.grellas.com/faq_business_startup_004.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grellas.com/faq_business_startup_004.html</a>). But, if the company takes in bridge funding in such a way that the common stock has to be repriced, say, up to $0.20/sh, any later recipient of 1M shares of such stock would be dealing with potential service income of $200K.<p>This issue can also arise if founders do a $.001/sh capitalization, and then do a funding that bumps up too close in time to their own capitalization. In some scenarios, the IRS can treat these as one event and attribute significantly more income to the founders than might appear from their own $.001/sh pricing.<p>As I said, the issues get complicated but that gives you an idea of the general principles.<p>A convertible bridge note avoids these tax issues by letting founders get funding without having to price the stock in any way - in essence, the terms of the note say it is a loan, repayable at x date, and forced to convert into preferred stock on the same terms (except for price discount) as those used in any qualified funding occurring within y period. In effect, re-pricing of the shares is deferred until the qualifying round. This lets the company defer the ""measurable event"" to the date of the qualifying preferred-stock round and lets them keep pricing nebulous (and hence ""cheap"") until then.",1250257815
762987,comment,762858,762858,0,0,gizmo,,,"Even for Adwood standards this article is really incoherent. It's also a bit of a troll.<p>The original claim (that web developers do web development because they're too dumb to do real programming) is of course silly. However, building web apps is to a large extend about memorizing quirks, testing code in a dozen different browsers and dealing with broken libraries and lousy debuggers. Maybe 2% of the time you deal with interesting problems, the other 98% of the time you're dealing with mundane problems. Not exactly intellectually challenging.<p>I think that to a large extend web applications are all about interface, and interface programming is almost inherently mundane. After you've worked out how everything is supposed to work on a whiteboard the rest is ""just the implementation"". If you're working on desktop applications, it's very different, because the interface is mostly composed of standard controls. Back in the 80ies every console application designed its own ascii interface. Arrow key navigation? Let's build that from scratch! Essentially, web development is in the same stage. Most of the JS code is mundane boilerplate. jQuery/prototype is a leap in the right direction, but we're still in the middle ages here.<p>On the desktop it's different. MS Paint? Algorithms, and lots of them! Memory management. Flicker free drawing. Bézier-approximations for line drawings. MS-paint, which is a relatively trivial desktop app, has more interesting problems than blog engines, CMS engines, hackernews (the app), photo sharing sites and so on.<p>Other apps I have open right now? VMWare. PDF reader. Text editors. IM client. Browsers. Putty. All these apps had to solve a lot of interesting problems.<p>With web development you don't get to design your application (your web framework connects a method to an url), you don't get to pick an architecture (MVC is always the right solution), there are no algorithms to develop, there is no memory to manage, there is no state space to design.<p>Web development is about giving people what they want. People want inane things, and the web is the best medium to deliver this inanity. Good business? Occasionally. Difficult computer science? Hardly.",1250257810

Google and many other websites make for a greatly reduced effort in finding relevant information. The web has fostered communities of 'true' hackers all over the globe, working on niches so obscure that 20 years ago you'd have never met someone that even understood what it was that you were trying to achieve. It's the democratization of hacking, the barrier to entry has been lowered.<p>And understandably that has some folks pining for old times.<p>Sure, some web programming is not as exciting as finding a really elegant solution to some problem with a two page algorithm that will have everybody think ('why didn't I come up with that?').<p>But on that level almost all of us became 'application programmers' long ago.<p>The toolbox is now so filled with great instruments that we can go and make some music. There is real programming to be found on all levels of the game, more on some than on others but still. And the tools are so easy to use that plenty of people that would never dream of a programming career a decade ago are getting in on the game, and they find that they can do useful stuff.<p>The 'real' hackers of today build the tools that the rest of us use, and I don't think it was ever any different, just some illusion. Mostly due to the fact that you used to be able to understand everything about some branch of computing.<p>The big issue here is that the 'browser' really is an intelligent terminal and that sooner or later you'll see the analogue between the way we work today and the way we worked in the early 70's to 80's, before the advent of the PC.<p>The PC revolution is slowly being reversed by the web, more and more data is migrating 'online', more and more code is server side. The only thing that works against that trend is 'ajax', where some code migrates the other way.<p>So, hacking is far from dead, web programmers are 'real' programmers, there is a lot of work to do and if you want to hack to your hearts content without feeling frustrated by all the layers I have a stack of 68000 manuals here that are looking for a new home. Then you can unplug your internet connection and pretend the revolution never happened.<p>Programming will never be 'just web programming' or any other form of it, software is so pervasive it is scary. If you are on the frontiers of computer vision, AI research or some other field that seems to have no impact on the web today then I'm sure that your technology + the web some day in the future will be a more powerful combination than without.<p>Technology is a means to an end.

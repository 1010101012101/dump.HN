If you want an example of the benefits allocated to wealthy, here is one - opportunities. I believe billionaire kids have a lot more opportunities in life compared to middle class kids, let alone poor ones.<p>Edit: tptacek, since I cannot reply to you, I will reply here - one example of what poor people won&#x27;t have access to &quot;tomorrow&quot; compared to rich people : ability to be rich. And I already explained the advantages of being rich over being poor are already (food/health/shelter/education/...). And yes, your questions certainly helped clarify my thoughts, so thanks :)",1398056391

7619852,comment,7619457,7619457,1,0,lancewiggs,,,"Congratulations - once you are accepted the rest is easy - after the decision that is.<p>It&#x27;s time for some deep thinking - each case is very personal and you need to decide what&#x27;s important to you and determine what you will get from going to a great school.<p>For me I saw Positives:\n- Learning: although in theory I could learn as much from books or by just doing it, I was going to be in a learning environment where I would have great teachers and peers - and the focus was learning. I learned a huge amount, and I recommend over-loading, getting beyond the business school and picking your subjects by professor as well as by what you want to learn. \n- Rubber stamping: My background before MBA school was hard to describe to people, but having an MBA from X made it easy to describe what I was and what I could do. \n- Opportunity: It certainly opens doors that sometimes I didn&#x27;t even know existed, in my case PE and McKinsey, and in other peoples&#x27; cases start-ups and so on. The net present value of your future income certainly rises, but you&#x27;ll also take more control of your future.\n- USA: If you are from offshore then you get the right to work in the USA after you finish. It&#x27;s not that simple but the USA is where a vast amount of business gets done and so you get to deal with big numbers.\n- Change: It&#x27;s a definitive move (and market signal) that you want to change what you do, either to switch careers or to upgrade the path that you are on.\n- People: You get to meet and hang out with a group of highly vetted amazing people for two years, and longer.\n- Fun. This was the deciding factor for me. It was a legitimate two years away from work and doing stuff that was enjoyable.<p>and Negatives:<p>Cash flow: You simultaneously stop working and start spending a large amount of money, and that&#x27;s going to set you back for a few years. But I focussed on net present value and it all worked out alright. For some the payoff may be negative, but with an MBA you should forever be able to find decent paying work.\nOptions: Going to school means you can&#x27;t do something else in that time. While most things can be put off for a couple of years, if your mate Bill has invited you to join him at his start-up called Micro-soft* then maybe you should do that instead.  \nUSA: If you are not from the USA then the food, politics,  police and poverty may be difficult to live with. It all depends on where you are coming from, and which school you are going too. Some schools are in or near upsettingly poor and violent areas. Meanwhile that right to work post degree isn&#x27;t necessarily a right to stay and do a start-up - so watch out.<p>Overall if you can get into a top school it&#x27;s generally a sign that you don&#x27;t really need to go. If you do go, I generally recommend you should, then embrace it by experimenting with subjects and activities, treating it as a collaborative rather than competitive situation and making sure you are having fun.<p>(*Steve Ballmer didn&#x27;t do the second year of his Stanford MBA for this reason)",1398056104

7619843,comment,7618125,7619192,6,0,avmich,,,"SpaceX claims that Falcon-9 first stage has a pretty good mass ratio - meaning that the fuel weights many times more than the tanks and engines (and everything else).<p>However, even if we assume 30 as the ratio of loaded vs. dry mass, which is better, for example, than Titan II first stage, which has pretty good mass ratio, we need to add the mass of landing legs - something unique for the Falcon. Suppose legs halve the mass ratio, making it 15.<p>9 engines are capable of lifting the dry first stage, the fuel in it, and the second stage plus payload. That means 9 engines can lift much more than 15 times the dry mass of the first stage. Dividing the thrust by 9 makes the thrust much more than necessary to support the dry stage.<p>In other words, even the thrust of a single Merlin engine is more than enough to brake the dry weight of the first stage. That means when first stage lands the engine is throttled - spending less mass of fuel per second than it does when Falcon lifts off. The better mass ratio of the first stage, the smaller flow of fuel is needed to decelerate it - so less fuel is needed to brake. It&#x27;s not enough to count seconds of thrust - how big the thrust is should also be taken into account.",1398055855

Corn seems to be the only crop that fills the gaps that is also compatible with the equipment we use to grow other grains. The market doesn&#x27;t give us incentive to shell out millions more for equipment to grow crops that are a radical departure from what we&#x27;re already growing (grains and oilseeds for human and animal consumption).<p>It&#x27;s far from perfect and is really a stopgap measure, but I&#x27;m not sure what the alternative to growing corn is.

7619831,story,,,7,6,ycskyspeak,"Ask HN: Interview Saturdays instead of interviews during work hours?",,"As I know people and as I have myself interviewed in places, it becomes pretty clear that the process itself is pretty awful. You have to take off from work and then meet the prospective employers - there is the obvious aspect of lying to your current employer as to where you are really going. Then the whole process becomes even more difficult when you want to evaluate multiple opportunities. Most startups want you to meet the team, and when I say team I mean the actual team, the CEO, the office manager, the spouse, the resident dog and the delivery man. The whole thing becomes this massive time sink which, although completely necessary, starts intruding on the day to day operations of the current job. Some folks dont have the luxury of quitting before looking and I was wondering if the concept of Interview Saturdays make sense? The prospective employers and interviewers can get through their day jobs without constant interview interruptions. The prospective interviewee doesnt have to lie or get behind on work. Everyone wins! Except Saturday, but then if you are in a hot startup, then tough shit. The time spent interviewing folks during the week will carry over to your nights and weekend anyway. This Interview Saturday will help you figure out people who are willing to make the sacrifices (Saturday gone) and will lead to less drawn out interview loops - also more efficient tracking of time spent on interviews if you silo the time.<p>What do you think?",1398055636

The value was in the other people in the program: a) class discussion is between students who all have work experience and come from different backgrounds and b) networking. \nNot all MBA programs are created equally, investigate the curriculum and talk to some current students.  Find out how many classes are taught by faculty vs. adjunct professors.  Adjunct professors aren&#x27;t always bad, especially if they are currently working in the industry they are teaching classes about and are willing to help you with networking after graduation.  Find out what style of program is it.  Mine was more entrepreneurial focused and less &quot;big management&quot; focused, so it largely avoided the issue of cranking out a bunch of group think clones that think they can solve any issue by applying some classroom theories.  With all of the reading, writing and presenting, I can see how easily it would be to fall into that trap after you&#x27;ve cleverly navigated so many various case studies by applying various popular management strategies.<p>If you want to start a business, some MBA programs can be helpful because of the networking and because you&#x27;ll have enough knowledge of various business topics to better engage accountants, lawyers and other professionals.  If you have a corporate job, it can be a good tool to help climb the management ladder - some companies require it to rise to certain levels in management.  If this is true, see if they&#x27;ll pay for part of it.\nI personally think all of the programs are overpriced.  I also think the actual value of the MBA has decreased as more universities crank out more MBAs semester after semester.  If you can two or three immediate benefits, if you can find a style of program that meets your needs and if you can afford it, go for it.  You won&#x27;t be worse off coming out of the program, but you might not be as better off as you hoped to be.",1398055313

The UK went through some of that at the start of the century where the country used to be owned by lord whatever in his stately home and then 80-90% taxes caused then to lose that and the places are now mostly owned by the National Trust and open to the public as historical exhibits. I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s going to play out this time. The world economy is growing quite well. The political will to even things up only seems to get strong enough to make a big upheaval with things like World War 1 in the above case so I imagine not much will change in the short term.",1398053858

In 1982 the industry-funded International Lead Zinc Research Organization (ILZRO) went to the Environmental Protection Agency to accuse Needleman of scientific misconduct. The EPA convened a committee of experts, which concluded that Needleman’s study had not proved a connection between lead exposure and a child’s mental development. Needleman countered that the committee report contained serious mistakes. The EPA agreed, reversed the committee’s findings, and lauded Needleman’s “pioneering study,” saying it confirmed a “significant association” between lead exposure and childhood intelligence.</i><p><i>The ILZRO hired the public-relations firm Hill & Knowlton to publicize the original committee’s criticisms of Needleman.</i><p><i>Two scientists led the next attack on Needleman.

The second was Claire Ernhart, a developmental psychologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, who called Needleman’s study “slipshod.” Beginning in 1983, Ernhart, who had conducted lead research, received about $50,000 a year from ILZRO for research support but denies being beholden to the lead industry or speaking on its behalf.

You can&#x27;t take it but complain they&#x27;re not doing something different, just like Google Search users can&#x27;t complain about a lack of phone support.  (And Google is a $363B company.)<p>I actually didn&#x27;t mean &quot;self-entitled&quot; in a general way (like, about your personality), or anything - rather just entitlement about something in this particular relationship.  For example, the same level of entitlement that you show might be absolutely fine when you deal with Starbucks, for example.  (If I read correctly that you&#x27;re a starbucks franchise owner).  It&#x27;s just that you&#x27;re showing this particular entitlement about airbnb, and there is nothing to justify it, as they don&#x27;t operate the same way or make the same sort of promises about their relationship with you.<p>Anyway it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to ask nicely, saying, pretty-please, wouldn&#x27;t you consider doing something different/ more explicit, better business support than what you&#x27;re doing now, for this and this reason.  They might not want to do that - then don&#x27;t use their business.  I wouldn&#x27;t operate an eBay store for example, because of the terrible things some eBay store operators say about eBay and their policies.  I just wouldn&#x27;t use it as a business front.<p>I think if you don&#x27;t want airbnb to just ignore you, you should consider playing at their level, with constructive feedback about what to do and how to do it, and if they <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to do that - then to make a hard decision about whether you want to do business on their terms, or make a living somewhere else.<p>You can&#x27;t get them to change their behavior by starting to behave as though they already promised to do that or set the relationship up like that.  They aren&#x27;t DoubleTree opening a franchise program.  It&#x27;s just a different sort of organization.",1398052927

So having sustainability was militaristic more so than anything else.<p>The Roman Empire spent a heck of a lot of money and effort on their people though. Don&#x27;t forget that in those times you could give a f*ck less about being royalty. If you were in the protected zones of the Romans you were already winning.<p>To Romans living inside the protected lands, the &#x27;outside world&#x27; looked cold, harsh, and barbaric. So, you could put up with inequality as long as those aristocrats were making sure that there were roads, aquifers, and soldiers! :P<p>Also, slaves could eventually attain freedom and citizenship. So, while it was not a good life it still had potential to become a decent one.<p>Now, there were uprisings against the Romans by people who benefited from years of Roman protection and decided later on &#x27;to plot their own course&#x27;. But that story is old/new. Happened to the Brits, Persians, Mongolians, etc.",1398052915

But the standard set of arguments for open source and &#x27;all bugs being shallow&#x27; would have expected it to be caught and fixed almost immediately.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that open source isn&#x27;t a better system, just that it&#x27;s not a guarantee of safety when compared to closed source in this regard - both systems have to have competent people actually caring enough to pore over the code and provide fixes. Consumers cannot be expected to manually review and audit every line of code in their networked devices, nor (apparently) can they reliably depend on someone else to do it for them.",1398052872

Everything except the hardware Wifi on/off switch works out of the box (the Wifi can be comfortably turned on/off via the Cinnamon network applet). Considering that this is new hardware (Haswell i7, 8GB DDR3 RAM and dual 256 GB SSD), I absolutely wouldn&#x27;t have any issues recommending Dell for Linux to anyone.<p>Finally, the above system can also be ordered with 12.04 LTS which means Dell is officially supporting Linux.

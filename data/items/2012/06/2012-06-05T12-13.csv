The bubble, to the extent that there was one, burst while we weren't looking.<p>Facebook's IPO is not really a huge issue in and of itself, and as Wilson points out the numbers they have are staggering. Other IPOs, like GroupOn's, have had similar issues and FB will probably look pretty awful by the time they reach the end of their lock-up period too. But this stuff is largely all indicative of market sentiment, and that's the issue.<p>People aren't necessarily disappointed with the performance of any of these companies, but they are getting very twitchy as investors. When people stop investing, and sentiment becomes increasingly bearish, it's like the tide going out and inevitably some boats will end up getting beached.<p>I know from companies attempting to raise capital in London right now that things have been difficult for a while now, and look set to get even more difficult (not that London is necessarily the greatest place for doing this, or a good barometer) - so those companies that have done decent rounds recently (HailO, BagThat, etc) will probably need to baton down the hatches somewhat, and those who were expecting to raise later this year / early next are probably in for a shock - a nasty one, if they can't operate without a raise (I know at least a couple of companies in that exact position).",1338900742

Write how you want to write. In other words write in your own style. If you are funny, that's fantastic, but if you prefer to present things in a straight-forward methodical fashion then do that. You will be spending a ton of time writing and re-writing: It will come much easier if it is in your own voice.<p>2. Don't be afraid to jump around. You do not need to start writing with chapter 1, then on to chapter 2, etc. Write whatever you are inspired to write at the moment. You can always go back and fill in the hard stuff later. You should do everything you can to make the process enjoyable, so, with that in mind, procrastinating frustrating parts is OK.<p>3. Write on a schedule and stick to it. If you don't feel like writing but it is the time you've scheduled, do it. I found on a number of occasions that even if I didn't feel like writing, once I started my mood shifted. Although sometimes I just failed to produce anything.<p>That's just off the top of my head. I'll come back and add more if I can think of worthwhile stuff to add.

As far as I can tell, our high-school CS curriculum in Queensland hasn't changed much since the early 90s. It consists of:<p>- One and a half semesters of ""conceptual schema design procedure"", backed up by a mundane textbook written in 1989 by a ""big wheel"" type from a local university. What makes this particularly strange is the amount of conceptual work you do on relational database schema design without <i>actually using</i> a relational database.<p>- Two and a half semesters of Visual Basic 6. I asked my teacher why he was still teaching it and his response was more-or-less ""...because it's the only language I know"". CS4HS could be a real help here.<p>- A smattering of lessons on ""social and ethical issues in IT"", which are about as insightful as they sound.<p>Of course, the HS curriculum is just one of the issues. The mining boom has meant that newly minted EEs can get up to $120k straight out of university by joining the fly in/fly out workforce in central QLD and WA, so the mathematically inclined students tend to choose civil, electrical, mechanical or chemical engineering courses.

For instance, yaourt (the one I've used for a while now) prompts you to edit the PKGBUILD on every package you try to install... and it displays the most recent comments on that package, so I'd notice that nodejs was a requirement.<p>But if you're not comfortable with PKGBUILDs and the like, I can see trying some alternate route when you notice that the AUR is out of date.",1338897605

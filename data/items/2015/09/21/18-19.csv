So it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re in a position to reasonably judge the reaction.<p>Suppose he did just take apart an old clock and piece it back together for fun, and didn&#x27;t specifically try to make it look like a bomb.  What was the purpose?<p>If it had been me, I would have been eager to explain why I chose that particular case.  Like maybe-- look &quot;how portable this is&quot; or &quot;look how you can hang this on the wall now&quot; or something like that.  Or maybe even just-- &quot;well I was messing around and just happened to have the case so that&#x27;s why I chose it.&quot;  I also would have been up front about the fact that all I&#x27;d done was dismantled and re-assembled an old clock.  I wouldn&#x27;t have tried to pass it off as an original circuit-board project of my own.<p>There&#x27;s nothing like that in this interview: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mW4w0Y1OXE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mW4w0Y1OXE</a><p>Also, as the OP notes, Ahmed makes a comment about using a cable to fasten it shut to make it look less suspicious.  OP wonders why would he have been thinking something like that, if he did not know that a suitcase would in fact be suspicious?  Sure, such a comment might have been made as some sort of back-rationalization after the whole thing blew up, but along with the other red flags it&#x27;s a suspicious statement.<p>And if he did deliberately try to make it look like a bomb and did nothing to assure his teacher and fellow classmates that it was not real, then it&#x27;s perfectly fair to call it a hoax.",1442861960

The core of GamerGate is the same bunch of misogynistic tools who have been around for years, occasionally manifesting into a herpetic flare-up somewhere or other before going away again for a while.

The notion that it has is fictional at its core.<p>The reason GamerGate functionally evaporated as quickly as it showed up, aside from particularly die-hard members of the useful-idiot troupe, is because most of your fellows went away once Stephen Colbert made fun of you.

The articles laid it all out in enormous detail - how the Iranians had paid a Palestinian terrorist group based in Syria to plant the bomb in a Toshiba cassette player. And that this had been done with the help of the Syrian authorities.</i><p><i>The terrorists were named and &quot;intelligence sources&quot; were quoted with absolute certainty saying that they knew this is what had happened. There was no mention at all of Libya.</i><p><i>But then suddenly in December 1990 there was there was a complete switch.</i><p><i>&quot;Intelligence sources&quot; in America began to tell journalists that they had found evidence that showed that it was Libya who had masterminded the bombing.</i><p><i>Then in June 1991 the British and American governments formally announced that Libya had been behind the bombing. Here is the first TV report, it includes a conservative MP called Teddy Taylor who had been to see Colonel Gaddafi. He raises the question that was going to lie at the heart of this puzzle.</i><p><i>Isn&#x27;t it a bit odd, he says, that at the very moment in 1990 when Syria became America&#x27;s ally in the first Gulf War, that America suddenly stopped accusing it of Lockerbie? And at the very same moment America and Britain suddenly find evidence proving it was Libya.</i><p><i>Suddenly the media was deluged with reports that said that the Lockerbie bombing had been carried out by Libya.</i><p><i>And many of the investigative journalists who had previously said that it was definitely Iran also changed their tune as well. Even the journalists who had written the Sunday Times articles saying there was concrete proof it was Iran and Syria now said it was the mad dog of terrorism - Colonel Gaddafi. And what&#x27;s more their &quot;intelligence sources&quot; were absolutely sure too.</i><p><i>But a few old-school investigative journalists held out against this sudden swerve. The main one was Paul Foot from Private Eye. He wrote a devastating pamphlet that tears part the whole American and British case against Libya.</i><p><i>Foot showed that much of it rested on the evidence of one extremely dubious witness called Mr Giaka who claimed to be high up in Libyan intelligence. In fact he was a mechanic in a garage who serviced the vehicles for Libyan intelligence - and he had been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the Americans.</i><p><i>Even his CIA handlers were very suspicious of him - and after two years of getting nothing from Mr Giaka they told him they would stop paying him unless he came up with some incriminating evidence for the US Department of Justice. The next day Giaka did just that - describing a samsonite suitcase that was loaded onto a plane in Malta by Libyan intelligence. Something he had forgotten to mention for two years.</i>",1442861781

Proposals like this one are very frequent but none of them address the issue of how exactly are the animals living in the wild protected against poaching. The assumption seems to be that as long as there are ranchers raising these animals for profit, the species should be protected. It does not address the issue of what will happen to the species once the demand for rhino horn plummets.<p>These legalized sales are very unpredictable. For example, the current ivory poaching crisis is attributed to the 2008 CITES reclassification of ivory that let some African countries sell their ivory stockpiles to China and Japan. This event caused an increase in demand for ivory products in China and Japan and the demand for ivory has been increasing year over year since then. As a result, poaching has skyrocketed to meet the demand.<p>If you live in Washington state, please support Initiative 1401 (<a href=""http://saveanimalsfacingextinction.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://saveanimalsfacingextinction.org</a>) on the November state ballot. This initiative will help with reducing the amount of illegal wildlife products coming to the US. Most of these products come to the US from China so ports in Washington state are a prime destination for the ships smuggling these products. California has recently passed a similar law.<p>I&#x27;ve recently started volunteering with the campaign and we are looking for more volunteers who would help out with the campaign efforts.

The standard stack for a jailbreak is usually something that requires the device to be pincode unlocked and plugged into a computer that the device has been told to &quot;trust&quot;, in order to take advantage of the attack surface provided by the protocols iTunes and Xcode use to talk to the device over USB, which often will touch the filesystem in complex ways, at least indirectly if not directly as part of something like &quot;restore a backup&quot;.

I was hoping for something about actually improving health using data.<p>A few random thoughts:<p>Genetics is probably the wrong place to look for explanations of the dramatic increase in premature births. Environment and lifestyle changes are probably a better place to look. If it were genetic, it should not be a sudden new thing -- unless it involves genetic damage, which can happen from envirinmental issues, which brings is back to environmental causes.<p>Genetic information can be amazingly empowering, but it is like a blueprint for how to build the body. Ignoring how throughputs interact with that information misses a big piece of the puzzle. Genetics are not destiny. They are code and how that code behaves depends on what it is given to work with.<p>Insurance companies will have to change how they work. Insurance is about risk management -- i.e. betting the odds. When the information you have about risks changes dramatically, you have to bet differently. The current model cannot survive in the face of emerging data of this sort.

I mean, this same argument can be said about the individual components of JailbreakMe 2.0 and 3.0: the initial exploit in FreeType only just barely got you the ability to run code as Safari within its even-at-the-time relatively restricted sandbox: it was then paired with a kernel exploit to finish the jailbreak.

At my 1 year review, I later found out that other developers on my team were making $70-80k, so I used some of the techniques described in the pastebin post to get another offer for $65k, get my employer to match, then I got the other company to beat my employer&#x27;s match with $70k. I stayed at that company for 3 months and then left to go to a better company for $80k. In this case I was completely honest about my salary, but my company flat out lied about what they could pay. After a year at $80k I switched companies and was able to jump to $110k by exaggerating my salary. I didn&#x27;t lie about it, but I reported my $80k plus 20% bonus (that I had a good chance of getting), perks such as 401k match, free concert tickets, etc as a &quot;total compensation&quot; of $100k.",1442858584

Mistakes take time to surface. Certain kinds of mistakes are worth avoiding, even if it slows down a process.<p>What are the solutions to this problem? A: Use a slow, tool that does not allow quick, possibly dangerous changes. B: Continue using fast, easily configurable solutions but build technology and process around them to provide the guarantees your business needs.<p>The problem with the problem A, as described, is you lose the benefits of the fast, nimble system because you want to slow things down.<p>It seems to me that (B) is worth considering.

By getting 10mpg better, do you produce fewer total emissions than if you had the emissions controls in place, but burned more fuel?<p>I imagine than there are many possible solutions where it makes sense to use strict emissions controls at the cost of fuel consumption, but there are also others where the increase in mileage would reduce total emissions further than the emissions controls would.<p>rough estimate. on a 25 gallon tank of diesel, with emissions controls in place, the truck goes 350 miles. on that same tank, the truck goes 625 miles with the emissions removed. so, to go 625 miles with the exhaust controls in place would use ~44 gallons of fuel vs 25. Is that actually a net environmental benefit? My gut tells me that the environmental costs of refining, transporting and burning the extra fuel are higher than the marginally higher emissions in the unrestricted truck. I don&#x27;t expect those numbers would work out the same in all vehicles or cases though.<p>I think public health and fuel economy go hand in hand. the total environmental costs of petroleum are much higher than the emissions that come out of cars. reducing demand through greater fuel economy should be factored in to the overall emissions equations.",1442858521

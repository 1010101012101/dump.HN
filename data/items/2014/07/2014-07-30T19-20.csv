Less dependencies lead to fewer problems caused by external/upstream changes.<p>> <i>OCaml isn&#x27;t all that much slower than C++. To use the Programming Language Shootout as a rough esimation[^1], it can even come close to matching C++ in certain programs, and is rarely more than three times as slow.</i><p>I wasn&#x27;t only referring to raw execution performance but also to GC pauses and GC overhead which I think are the bigger issue. The benchmark you linked tests for compute load so this doesn&#x27;t really show up. Anecdotal point; in most real world apps I have worked on the GC was a limiting factor.<p>> <i>Finally: the article didn&#x27;t say, &quot;the Linux kernel&quot;—it said, &quot;Ubuntu.&quot; The kernel itself might be secure and reliable, but a running Linux system is much, much more than just the kernel.</i><p>That&#x27;s the beauty of having a kernel though. If one of those userland processes is broken it won&#x27;t affect the whole system.<p>> <i>an arbitrary piece of C code might not segfault given certain input, but a given piece of OCaml code definitely won&#x27;t.</i><p>This assumes that the OCaml compiler/interpreter and the hardware are free of bugs...",1406750389

And while C can be security-audited, many of the properties that are important to verify in a C program come <i>entirely for free</i> from something like OCaml—e.g., an arbitrary piece of C code <i>might not</i> segfault given certain input, but a given piece of OCaml code <i>definitely won&#x27;t</i>. So maybe a running Linux system is &quot;secure enough&quot;, but a unikernel like this will have a much smaller attack surface and stronger inherent security properties with basically no extra work.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not the original author, I&#x27;m just speaking generally.<p>[^1]: <a href=""http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=ocaml&lang2=gpp&data=u64"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64/benchmark.php?te...</a>",1406749739

I was not making any point about the novelty or other quality metrics of the patent.<p>However, now that you&#x27;ve brought it up, possibly outside of material science, <i>every</i> invention in the history of engineering falls under the description of &quot;old elements doing old things producing expected results&quot;. Taking that quote out of context misses a very important question: was it obvious <i>beforehand</i>  that such a result was desirable enough to put those elements together?<p>The answer to your question of &quot;what&#x27;s novel&quot; is, literally, the combination of elements and the difference it presents over prior art. However, at a higher level, what this quantitative approach misses is this: slide-to-unlock provides a convenient, usable and visually appealing way to unlock a phone. You&#x27;ll note that these adjectives are some that Apple users regularly attribute to Apple products (since before the iPhone!). These qualities are arguably a primary reason for their success.<p>Sure, when boiled down to their implementation, they don&#x27;t look so impressive, yet few others are said to match Apple&#x27;s level of polish.

Psychotherapy is a process that is designed to help quiet these menacing internal voices (harmful parent voices, self-doubt etc.). There are different therapy orientations: cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, psychodynamic therapy, etc. They approach these outdated programs in different ways. CBT tries to kill them by applying logic (e.g., My startup is going to fail! [what rational evidence do you have for that belief?]) Relational approaches try to better understand the threatening feeling or impulse that triggers the harmful programs. It focuses on the defense used to keep the threatening feeling in check and anxiety at bay (e.g., I&#x27;m really afraid of failing [emotion = fear of failing], so I become a driven workaholic to try to avoid this outcome and feel less anxiety [defense]). A relatively recent innovation in the therapy space is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. The key insight is that often the attempt to control, diminish, or avoid pain is what keeps you entangled in the pain. Simply making space for the pain, sinking into it, observing it, and feeling it, is what allows it to become disentangled. This, however, is very hard to do, b/c the natural impulse is to avoid pain and the issues that cause pain.<p>Here is a helpful short video that metaphorically captures the ACT disentanglement process (Demons on a Boat): <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-wyaP6xXwE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-wyaP6xXwE</a>.<p>Okay, one last point, I&#x27;m game for doing my small part to help reach the impossible goal.

At one time, merely owning a Bible printed in the King&#x27;s English was the vilest of offenses. Yet I doubt one could find many modern Christians who would condemn their ability to read their own Bibles as a clear heresy, and submit themselves to the stake forthwith for a proper burning.<p>I would even go so far as to submit that blasphemy is a part of the natural evolutionary process of any religion, as each generation comes to terms with the outdated assumptions and propaganda of the prior order. What did Jesus mean when he (supposedly) said the Sabbath was meant to serve man, instead of man to serve the Sabbath?

Highway traffic is easier to navigate with an algorithm - nearly trivial if you could compel a retrofit of all vehicles with a low power radio broadcasting its position, so that any autonomous vehicles around it can perceive it via its own sensors, any external gps radar, and the cars pings. Even without that, it is easier to juggle the variables of a high way (multiple lanes, moving in a direction, consider merge traffic, maintain safe stop distances, etc) than to try to navigate intersections and pedestrian traffic. Also, 18 wheelers don&#x27;t need human interfacing, whereas self driving taxis require that licensed, but non-owners, sit in the drivers seat of the taxi since nobody will let self driving cars pilot themselves without someone to take manual control if necessary for a while. Albeit, that remains a problem with the 18 wheeler, but I see letting self driving tractor trailers without pilots come much sooner than self driving taxis without the passenger in the drivers seat.",1406748451

That&#x27;s an investment on the order of $6-8 million dollars.<p>Why should I choose to do that? 5 is a moving target, and the island of stability (Perl 6) seems to be just around the corner forever. Except 6 will be an early, unoptimized version of whatever it will eventually become so I won&#x27;t want to use it till it&#x27;s well tested in real environments. Okay so I wait another year after 6 comes out, now I have even more legacy code to deal with.<p>So what are the metrics to port Perl 5 to 6? I have no idea, nobody really does. What does it cost to move 2 million lines of Perl 5 to Perl 6? The syntax is <i>just</i> different enough that I&#x27;ll have to add another $1-2 million dollars or so into the long-term budget to port my Perl 5 code to Perl 6. I&#x27;m aware there are some conversion utilities, but now I have to QA all of the converted code and check for regressions and then fix them when they show up.<p>Sure I can just write for 5.xx and just stay there forever, but what if 6 does generally come out? Will the development community just shift over to 6 and now I don&#x27;t get feature improvements and bug fixes? What&#x27;s the long-term support case look like? I can&#x27;t exactly contract the &quot;Perl Company&quot; to ensure I have long-term Perl 5 support for the next 5-10 years. So I&#x27;m just guessing and praying that what I&#x27;m building will have long-term support.<p>Or I can just tell my team to build in Python or Java or something else, not worry about all this and save $1-2 million in eventual porting and long-term maintenance costs.<p>There&#x27;s actual business reasons for this. Every technical decision maker ruminating on Perl has gone through this, and they&#x27;ve decided to not go with Perl for these kinds of reasons. Which is why there are so few jobs requiring Perl, and why nobody bothers to learn it anymore.<p>Now, you may be swimming in hundreds of millions of dollars of personal wealth and can afford to make the decision to go with Perl, and that&#x27;s cool. But unless you&#x27;re willing to offset instability in the platform with personal investments in thousands of companies and development efforts, you can swear at me all you want, it won&#x27;t change anything until Perl is again a stable platform and is solving people&#x27;s problems.<p>To put the woes of Perl 6 in even more perspective. It&#x27;s taken so long for Perl 6 to happen that Go, a language that didn&#x27;t even exist when Perl 6 was announced, had a team formed, was announced, was developed with full-tooling and a robust standard library, went through betas, and is now in production use inside of hundreds of companies in less than <i>half</i> the time than it&#x27;s taken for Perl 6 to get into some kind of alpha stage from announcement.",1406748234

I think the answer to 1) is going to end up as &quot;insurance companies&quot;.<p>In order to put an autonomous vehicle on the road, it&#x27;s going to have to be insured. Insurance companies will have to vet any and all autonomous vehicles anyway, assume direct financial liability for all harms resulting from anything that could go wrong with such a vehicle, and charge whatever premiums they think are approprite to cover those liabilities to the owner of each vehicle.<p><i>How</i> they vet autonomous vehicles up to them, and it&#x27;s probably going to be tricky at first - maybe on a comparable order of trickyness as actually making an autonomous vehicle. But they&#x27;re going to have to do it if only to get their premiums right. Maybe they&#x27;ll require certain development practices, like using specific programming languages, or programming conventions within a language, or requiring 3rd party static analysis of all the code (e.g. Coverity), or mandatory reviews of all checkins by at least one other developer than the person who wrote it, or a certain level of automated test coverage, or &quot;passing&quot; a certain percentage of simulated situations.<p>Whatever the insurance companies do, they&#x27;re going to have to get some measure of how dangerous these vehicles are.<p>The better a manufacturer does on the vetting process, the more open they are, the lower the premiums will be to any owners of their cars.<p>At that point, the insurance companies should be in a position to assume all direct financial liability resulting from an accident - <i>as they are now</i> (discounting your excess) - including negligence, as that&#x27;s the only incentive we can put on them to ensure they&#x27;ve done <i>their</i> part right. The lawyers will of course ensure that if a vehicle as supplied is not up to the standard that the insurance company confirmed, either in terms of hardware or software, then the insurance company will have a way to take that up with the manufacturer.<p>Naturally, if you mod your autonomous vehicle in any ways not permitted by your cover, you may void your insurance. At that point the liability falls entirely on you, the owner. But again, that&#x27;s just as things are now.",1406748075

8110266,comment,8105483,8108217,2,0,mcguire,,,"Many factors are involved here. On one hand, you&#x27;re right about Dijkstra (Is $1000 an option? I never actually got my copy signed (sigh), but....) and Nancy Drew, but on the other I think it&#x27;s likely that most of the money involved involves &quot;mass market&quot; books: thrillers, Oprah&#x27;s picks, the stuff on the New York Times list. At some point it does boil down to the marginal situation of &quot;two unknown authors&quot; (or two approximately equivalent ones) that really are semi-commodities. Think of a reader who has read everything that has been suggested or is from their favorite authors, and is looking for something new.<p>Also keep in mind that the &quot;mass&quot; entertainment market is not competing with speciality books, but is competing with other entertainment options: Netflix, movies, drunken debauchery, etc.<p>Then there is the price levels we&#x27;re talking about. Everyone (probably) has some price X below which they will have no problem impulse-buying. Then there&#x27;s a price Y below which they&#x27;re willing to take chances, with information, and then there are prices above that, which require actual consideration. And for most people, at least those buying ebooks, we are definitely arguing in this range. For my inner economist, publishers want ebook prices up in the high segment, above Y, while Amazon wants them roughly between X and Y.<p>&quot;<i>If Amazon has helpful data to add to this, why don&#x27;t they open it up and let everyone, publishers included, see it to help price the books better?</i>&quot;<p>The specifics are very likely competitive trade secrets. Don&#x27;t forget Amazon gets to deal with Apple, B&N, and a host of other retailers. I&#x27;m surprised they released the one number they did. On the other hand, judging by negotiations I&#x27;ve been in, I would not find it unplausible that Hachette is aware of those numbers.<p>&quot;<i>They are trying to squash publishers, gain control of the market and dictate prices, which they cannot currently do.</i>&quot;<p>Yes, just like the publishers are trying to squash Amazon, gain control of the market, and dictate prices. Heck, this isn&#x27;t even a particularly new situation: I&#x27;m sure the negotiations between publishers and distributors that led to the lovely &quot;stripping&quot; practice were just as entertaining.",1406746852

We&#x27;ll have light rail within 2 miles in a few years and have shuttles to the same rail service (but going in closer to the city). But yeah, most people drive.<p>Nearby towns (major nearby employment centers) are 10-30 minutes away by car and have ample free parking. Two of the bigger towns are also on the same rail line. The big city is about an hour by car outside of rush hour and you have to pay to park, rail and bus are faster and cheaper. However, all of the major tech employment in the area happens in a belt that stretches from my neighborhood into the city, there&#x27;s negligible tech work actually <i>in</i> the city.<p>There&#x27;s 17-23 million square feet of commercial and office space getting zoned right now that will set up a major employment center about 5 minutes away (with a world trade center and all that jazz). And I can <i>almost</i> but not quite see from one of the two coffee shops I&#x27;m working at today, the largest collection of new data center construction on the East Coast. Major tech employers range from aerospace to internet companies to government. So it&#x27;s all fairly future proof.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s sprawl I guess. But it&#x27;s not the mile after mile of unending prefab houses that defined suburbia from the 40s to the 90s either (though there is some of that out here as well, just not in my immediate area). From my front window I can see homes designed and built by 3 different developers and I think 8 or 9 participated in total. This isn&#x27;t custom architecture, but if you get bored you can walk a block and see something that looks different at least.<p>Today for lunch my major conundrum was should I eat Greek, Thai, American style Chinese, Italian, Burgers, Subs or Tex-Mex within walking distance, or head out in my car for a quick 5-minute spin to get Vietnamese, Indian, Taiwanese or Korean. I decided to walk to my local pizza place, get a couple slices of pizza and then walk to one of my two local coffee shops and hang out for the rest of the day.<p>A slightly longer drive and I can add in Ethiopian, Bolivian, Salvadorian, Mexican, even more Korean, even more Vietnamese...and of course every kind of chain food you can imagine from Taco Bell to TGIF.",1406746846

228283,comment,228233,228233,0,0,andreyf,,,"Short answer: nurture, very early on, because children have a fantastic curiosity and ego-less stubborn determination.<p>Long answer: From my personal experience, a lot of what some claim to be 'nature' is actually very early-age 'nurture'. So it's not that children of academics are genetically smarter, it's that they are raised by people with whom dinner or a walk in the park ends up being as educational as a university lecture. On top of that, if you consider that knowledge is like money under compound interest, I think it's possible to explain people that seem smart beyond comprehension as just having gotten a good head start on learning.<p>Math is also a special case for two (related) reasons: (1) emotions, especially ego, has a lot to do with learning math, and (2) math is filled with ""aha"" moments, where one thing which seemed incomprehensible one moment is obvious the next. Little kids have an advantage related to both of these - they (hopefully) don't yet have an ego to build or protect when it comes to knowing things, and they take a lot more pleasure from the ""aha"" moments.<p>So to answer your question - I would say it's nurture, but the kind which is (most of the time) limited to very young ages. On the other hand, given the determination and stubbornness of a 5 year old facing a challenge, it's nothing you can't do at 40. But I worry that I don't quite have that determination at 22, and will only have less of it as I am starting to worrying about becoming financially secure, starting a family, etc.",1214456064

228280,comment,228233,228233,0,0,mark-t,,,"Math education is so bad right now that any genetic differences are drowned out almost entirely. Of all the mathematicians I've met (including IMO gold medalists, Fields medalists, etc.), there seems to be little correlation with siblings, at least beyond what you would expect from having parents who emphasize learning math.<p>To answer your question, if you want to contribute significantly, you will need to study hard for several years, but it is possible. One of the best mathematicians I know well didn't have any interest until he was 16, and he's now 25 or so.",1214455806

228277,comment,227913,228232,0,0,timr,,,"This is absolutely true.  And as a prospective employee, it's <i>your</i> job to make sure that you don't get screwed.<p>Obviously, you can't predict the future;  you'll never know if a company is going to go public at a valuation of billions, or go broke in a year.  But you can use certain guidelines: How many companies in the industry have gone public/sold/failed?  What were the successful companies' valuations?  What's your employer's current valuation?  Etc.<p>Moreover, anything less than a percent of equity in a startup  really isn't worth your excitement.  Only a tiny handful of startups ever sell for valuations of >$50 million.  In the event of a sale at that valuation, your 1% stake is worth (at most) $500,000 -- nothing to sneeze at, certainly, but not enough to retire young.  Yet very few engineers are granted that much equity; unless you're one of the first employees, a more typical stake is 0.1% or less.  So now, that $50 million exit is going to pay you $50,000 -- a nice down-payment on a house (in Ohio, maybe).  About the only way to get rich via employment is through extreme luck (i.e. find the next Google and join early), or through the gradual accumulation of shares over a long period of time.<p>Bottom line:  demand fair compensation, and don't sell yourself out for stock options.  Startups can be great places to work, they're fun, and you'll learn a lot, but unless it's <i>your</i> startup, you're most likely <i>not</i> going to get rich.",1214455714

But I want to tell my own experience.<p>I was very bad at math when I was in high school. I figured out algebra without problem but failed pretty bad in classical geometry when I was 9th grade. From my 10th to 12th grade, I just have dyslexia to what math textbook says.<p>Then I studied with 2 teachers for a year to prepare taking another entrance examination in my country (Taiwan). Both  explained clearly two things to me that I like most later, one is physics and another is math. The math teacher taught me calculus in 2 weeks and I just started to become literate to meanings in those symbols and after that when I look back analytic geometry and classical mechanics in our high school textbooks, I just felt my mental block was removed! I did not feel any trouble in understanding the problems and I later chose my major in physics just because I like to learn more of it and went through my undergraduate pretty ok and later I found computer science and I started to work in the trench for 16 years.<p>I did not make any contribution to math and physics, but I still like to use the training that I received in my daily life and I still sometime open books from Dover Publishers to read and feel interested. I like the feeling in figuring out problems and find ways to solve them. And that is the joy I'm glad to had a chance to acquire due to two best teachers that enlighten me.",1214455368

But one way to think of them is as a negotiation about what the multiple is.<p>Consultancies commonly sell for 1.5x-2x, because staff turnover means the acquiring company is really only getting a pipeline, some relationships, and maybe a few staff.<p>Enterprise product companies commonly sell for around 5x. Security valuations oscillate between 5x and 15x (on the wildly successful side). Sometimes new, small startups sell for ridiculous high multiples because otherwise the total number would be too low.<p>I'm not saying, ""take your revenue and multiply by two"". I'm saying, ""think about the value you provide your acquirer in the abstract"", and then put a multiple to it.",1214454367

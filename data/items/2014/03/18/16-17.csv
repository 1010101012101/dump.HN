7423168,comment,7422442,7422653,3,0,timje1,,,"Considering some of the atrocious numbers I&#x27;ve heard thrown around regarding piracy on the PC, DRM that scares off some customers may be the result of some execs doing some hard number crunching. Something like:<p>At current estimates, we sell 1m copies, and we&#x27;ll get 5m pirates. If we put in really restrictive DRM, 100k of those original 1m sales will be put off, but we&#x27;ll pick up one tenth of the pirates, putting us on 1.4m sales. Worth it!<p>The problem with this calculation is that the pirates are often based in 2nd world countries that don&#x27;t have a culture of paying for media (e.g. Russia) so preventing piracy won&#x27;t boost sales from these countries. But have you folks ever tried to convince anyone with money on the line that piracy numbers != lost sales?",1395161978

The OS matters, and I would bet that someone could do way better than running Linux in a watch (something much more low-level on a much weaker processor could extend the battery life significantly).<p>The hardware and sensors is the big problem. Currently, the best smartwatch specs I have seen are the Basis B1. It claims it can monitor your heart rate, track your sleep, etc. But that is all a lie. Sure, it can track your heart rate at rest, but during intensive exercise there is no comparison with something like a Polar chest strap. At the same time the claim that the B1 can monitor your sleep phase based on your heart rate is a bit far fetched as well. From what I&#x27;ve read the heart rate does not change by more than 1-2 bpm between REM and deep sleep, which is within the margin of error of the measurements, so the data out will be all wrong. As for the non-fitness functions of a smart watch, I don&#x27;t see a huge value in having my wrist buzz every time a random ticket on GitHub gets updated or NewRelic sends me a performance metrics summary. Even text messages are much easier to process on the phone.<p>I want to believe in the smartwatch idea. I want it to be a gadget that somehow improves my daily life.

No matter how functional these devices are they are first and foremast a fashion accessory and need to look good. There will also need to be a large variety. Every time I look at buying a new watch I cycle through dozens and dozens of devices before I find one I like the look of. This is where I think Google has the upper hand on Apple with wearables. Apple will most likely produce the only device running their software and a lot of people won&#x27;t like wearing the same fashion accessory as everyone else - they will want choice. Of course if Apple knocks it out of the park with the software/sensors (which is plausible from what I read about Healthbook yesterday) the functionality may just edge out the important of fashion.",1395160731

This is correct -- there are any number of examples where the statistical reasoning behind the normal distribution is wildly inappropriate to the data set being analyzed. The classic example is a dataset with anomalous outliers, say, a cohort in which one person died in childbirth and another who lived to the age of 120. Average age: 60.<p>But the physicists who apply this method to their LHC data, and those who apply it to the newer finding of gravitational waves,  know exactly what they&#x27;re doing. The data being analyzed are entirely appropriate to this method, and the conclusions being drawn are sound.",1395160216

It makes sense, from some standpoints. The experience offline wouldn&#x27;t be what the game developers wanted it to be. SimCity on the other hand, was never developed to be online-only. The reason it was is because EA got greedy, and everyone saw right through it.<p>Now, should apps have an offline mode? Yeah, if at all possible. Let&#x27;s take Google Play Music as one example. By default, it&#x27;s a streaming service. But if I lose connectivity I still want to listen to my music, so I can download the songs locally. Now, I just found out the other day that these files aren&#x27;t downloaded locally forever, so when I left a service area my music stopped even though I had downloaded it previously. Frustrating to no end.<p>So yeah, if the app should have an offline mode and it makes sense to have an offline mode, don&#x27;t neglect to put one in just because you want complete control.

American people - which we&#x27;ll broadly define as the &quot;middle class&quot; who statistically speaking don&#x27;t have these tech skills - don&#x27;t want this. Why would they want foreigners taking their jobs? It makes no sense. Thus they will vote, or have political influence, tending to enact policy that is tough on immigration.<p>Founder visas for tech companies with the intention of creating jobs does not change this, because it creates <i>tech</i> jobs. Middle class America can&#x27;t fulfill this in meaningful-enough numbers for there to be any positive political influence.<p>&quot;Let us show you what we can do with 100 visas.  This will be measurable, and in 5 years, we can tell you exactly how many jobs get created.&quot;<p>This won&#x27;t matter much until jobs get created in large enough numbers for the middle class. What&#x27;s important though will be (and it&#x27;s hard to tell if this is the case) a &quot;trickle-down&quot; effect, where these relatively small number of tech jobs created lead to the creation of other jobs that have a meaningful impact. EDIT - an example that comes to mind is Homejoy, which creates more maid jobs... but boy oh boy can this sort of thing sound like inequality (&quot;let foreign founders come in to make web services turning Americans into maids!&quot;).<p>Think about it - even if a new Google pops up in the next 5 years - that&#x27;s 25K jobs. Drop in the ocean. 2.2M jobs were created in 2012; let&#x27;s say in 5 years 10M jobs are created. 25K new tech jobs for a new Google represents a difference of 0.25%. I guess that&#x27;s something - but how many of those 25K jobs will be filled by American citizens?<p>In short - there&#x27;s absolutely no reason not to have a founder visa like proposed. That would be sweet. But from the policy makers&#x27; perspectives, it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s a compelling enough reason to change the status quo. If anything it&#x27;s just easy to paint as &quot;let rich investors bring in foreign engineers to build new websites and apps&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t really resonate.<p>Feel free to point out flaws in this argument, it would probably help the OP&#x27;s cause.

And Y is just a placeholder for a number, it&#x27;s not tied to any particular function.&quot;<p>In point of fact, the standard deviation is more than a particular number, it&#x27;s an idea, and its statistical purpose is met when it&#x27;s associated with a context in which that idea is expressed. That context is the normal distribution. In the present context, a particular sigma value refers to a specific area under a normal distribution, and in turn, to the probability that a particular result might have arisen by chance.<p>Without reference to a normal distribution, a standard deviation (a sigma) loses its conventional meaning. Variances are acquired by statistical tests of data sets, standard deviations (sigmas) are acquired from variances, and conclusions are drawn from sigmas only to the degree that they are applied to normal distributions.<p>Link: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule</a><p>Quote: &quot;In statistics, the 68–95–99.7 rule, also known as the three-sigma rule or empirical rule, states that nearly all values lie within three standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.\nAbout 68.27% of the values lie within one standard deviation of the mean. Similarly, about 95.45% of the values lie within two standard deviations of the mean. Nearly all (99.73%) of the values lie within three standard deviations of the mean.&quot;<p>According to your thesis, the above claim is obvious nonsense, because in point of fact, sigma has no association with the normal distribution. But you know what? Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, and you can correct this egregious error today, if you like. Correct this widespread erroneous thinking -- fix these errors, everywhere you find them.<p>Let&#x27;s perform a little test. Let&#x27;s submit &quot;5 sigma&quot; to Wolfram Alpha and see whether it makes the same mistake you say I have been making, and that the above linked article is making:<p>------------------------------------------------------<p>Link: <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5+sigma"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5+sigma</a><p>Quote:<p><pre><code>    Input Interpretation: 5 sigma (standard deviations)\n    z-score : 5\n    Probabilities:\n        zɝ (left-tailed p-value) | 1-2.867×10^-7\n        zɱ (right-tailed p-value) | 2.867×10^-7\n        abs(z)ɱ (two-tailed p-value) | 5.733×10^-7\n        abs(z)ɝ (confidence level) | 1-5.733×10^-7\n    Associated two-sided confidence level: 100-5.733×10^-5%\n</code></pre>\n------------------------------------------------------<p>So it seems that, without prompting, Wolfram Alpha draws the same conclusion that Wikipedia does, and every other online reference does when confronted by terms such as &quot;standard deviation&quot; or &quot;sigma&quot; -- that, without providing a specific context, the <i>default context</i> is that sigmas refer to positions on a standard distribution and have statistical meanings associated with that default assumption.<p>> Of course, even with a Gaussian assumption, standard deviation does not have a particular numerical value.<p>When a scientist uses the term &quot;5 sigma&quot;, she is in most cases using a context of a <i>normalized</i> normal distribution, one that follows the 68-95-99.7 rule described above. Therefore yes, 5 sigma does lead to a a particular value, by being applied to a definite integral of a <i>normalized</i> normal distribution that uses it as an argument. By this reasoning, 5 sigma means:<p>(Sage notation) integrate(e^(-x^2/2),x,a,b) / sqrt(2 * pi)<p>Picture: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/YhC302b.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/YhC302b.gif</a><p>If I try to compute the value used in physics, the result for 5 sigma, I can use this:<p>(Sage notation) N(integrate(e^(-x^2/2),x,5,infinity) / sqrt(2 * pi))<p>With this result: 2.86651571870318e-7<p>Which is correct, and is the expected one-tailed value for 5 sigma, even though according to your argument, 5 sigma has no connection to normal distributions.<p>> Sorry &#x27;bout that.<p>What, for your specious argument? No problem, it comes with the territory. But surely you realize I have more than answered your objection.",1395159747

7422821,comment,7421018,7421455,1,0,programminggeek,,,"I&#x27;ve worked on two large applications that would both benefit from Clean Architecture and they don&#x27;t feel like outliers, they feel like the natural progression from any MVC framework to an app of significant complexity.<p>The first was a very large PHP app that ran a fundraising website that processed millions of dollars in donations. It grew organically over time and there was need to change database structure or swap out whole modules of the infrastructure like the site search. It was mostly untestable and really could benefit some automated testing.<p>Over time the app was moved to a Ruby web API with Sinatra with a decent Service layer with great test coverage. It&#x27;s been a massive improvement over what was there originally and moved towards more Clean Architecture principles over time. It never went full Clean Architecture because getting team buy-in was difficult and until you feel the pain of a complex, monolithic codebase with minimal tests and a few botched late night deploys, it is hard to feel the pain that Clean Architecture solves.<p>The second app I&#x27;ve seen that would benefit from Clean Architecture is a Rails app that is pretty vanilla Rails. Normal MVC and all that. Lots of ORM and so on. The tests ran slow and over time the required reporting complexity made the database queries slow and terrible. We&#x27;ve pulled things into a service layer and presenters which helps a bit, but doesn&#x27;t solve everything. Now we are moving the app reporting into a very functional, immutable approach where we calculate and cache everything all at once in the background. We are only using the models for basic CRUD and for easily pulling out our data structure from the DB, which is then handed to a bunch of functions which calculate everything. It&#x27;s very much a functional core, mutable shell approach. Even still, this isn&#x27;t a fully Clean Architecture approach, but it&#x27;s a lot closer, and it solves a lot of the problems that default Rails MVC doesn&#x27;t.<p>Clean Architecture is probably best thought of as something people move towards over time as they feel the pain of not having it. Once you feel that pain, it is completely reasonable to want to start your projects clean and keep them that way, but good luck convincing other developers to join you if they haven&#x27;t felt the pain.",1395159673

I do have a list of things I want to tackle next (see the roadmap page), but I&#x27;ll most likely release them separately from core.<p>@hcho: re: integrating w/ jQuery: see the integrating w/ other libraries page in the guide section. There&#x27;s a simple example w/ select2 there.<p>@abjorn: those are excellent points. Re: turing completeness: my take is that things like good error messages in the view layer are more important than trying to prevent people from doing stupid things (that&#x27;s what code reviews are for). Re: Bindings: I&#x27;m most familiar w/ Angular ones and yes, their bidi-bindings are really convenient, but they fail in some 5-10% of the use cases for me (either by being too aggressive or not expressive enough). So, that&#x27;s a conciseness vs power trade-off in design from my personal experience. Re: templating, you can take the model-level utilities and integrate w/ other templating libraries. I do provide some comparisons w/ React and a few other frameworks in the misc section of the guide, as well as design rationales in the main guide page. TL;DR I use other frameworks full-time and I&#x27;ve done homework before I settled on the current implementation :)<p>@hanburglar I do provide a tool to convert HTML to Mithril (although not automated yet), see the &quot;useful tools&quot; page.<p>@timmiwil: you&#x27;re right, jQuery is not MVC (I mention this in the comparisons page). The point is that with idiomatic jQuery, the app developer is responsible for knowing when to use .text() instead of .html(), whereas with, say, idiomatic Angular, that&#x27;s not a concern, ever. jQuery &quot;templating&quot; tends to get pretty hard to audit as widgets become more complex (see select2 source code, for example)<p>@tzaman: I do contribute to Angular and other projects that I use as time permits (mostly bug reports)<p>@BaconJuice: it&#x27;s a side project, but a scratch-an-itch one that I work on pretty much every night.

So once again, you are basing your reasoning on a false assumption, and therefore you are naturally reaching false conclusions. (Note that my computation proves something stronger: that the distance required, extrapolated from the LIF, for the outgoing light ray the astronaut/skydiver passes at t = 0 in the LIF to catch the first probe, is much larger than the size of the LIF. If this is true, it must also be true that the second probe can&#x27;t catch the first probe within the LIF.)<p>To briefly expand on what the computation I linked to shows: the smaller you make epsilon, the smaller the difference in velocities between the two probes can be (because the first probe has to be launched at escape velocity, and the smaller you make epsilon, the closer escape velocity gets to the velocity of light). And the smaller the velocity difference, the larger the catch-up distance, in the same proportion. So decreasing epsilon increases the catch-up distance extrapolated from the LIF such that the extrapolated catch-up distance remains much larger than the size of the LIF. (Again, my computation proves something stronger: that the catch-up distance required for the outgoing light ray, extrapolated from the LIF, increases as epsilon decreases, such that the catch-up distance remains much larger than the size of the LIF.)<p>To expand on the expansion just a bit more: remember that, in order for there to be any potential issue to discuss at all, two things must be true: (1) the initial conditions must match in both LIFs; (2) the <i>global</i> prediction of whether or not the second probe catches the first must be different for the two scenarios. Requirement #2 is what forces us to change the initial velocity of the first probe when we change epsilon; requirement #1 is what forces us to change the initial velocity of the first probe in <i>both</i> LIFs when we change epsilon.<p>(Actually, to expand one more bit, there is a third condition: the LIF size over which we can do the comparison at all must be the <i>smaller</i> of the two LIF sizes. Otherwise there would be no point to the comparison, since we could always just call globally flat spacetime an &quot;LIF&quot; and find some difference between it and an LIF in any curved spacetime by looking at effects that happen outside the range of the curved spacetime LIF.)",1395159274

This drove a whole codebreaking fascination thing with mathematics.<p>So not wishing to miss out on all the action, a project was started called The Enigma Project which features basic codebreaking challenges (basic substitution ciphers, OTP etc) aimed at primary school children. This was started by Simon Singh / Cambridge University after good old Si released a book called The Code Book after which he wanted to drum up publicity rapidly. No other reason.<p>So after a year or so of neglect these sheets work their way into &quot;photocopy circulation&quot; amongst schools in the UK as part of the typical &quot;teachers don&#x27;t give a shit and just want to hand out worksheets&quot; culture that appeared.<p>Obviously any other material that could be assembled cheaply was chucked on the back. Turns out there&#x27;s a couple of sheets plainly marked from GCHQ in there as well as &quot;additional exercises&quot;. Rather interesting as they are above what you&#x27;d consider appropriate for that age (prime factorisation and rapid factorisation techniques etc). Very odd!<p>Now this in itself is pretty null and void but it leads into the culture which I experienced where we were asked in secondary school mathematics to enter various &quot;challenges&quot; to play off against other schools. I was pretty good at mathematics (at GCSE and A-level) and did well on these challenges but was approached after this by people recruiting for SIGINT rather than go to university. Other people who did well were similarly propositioned. I impolitely declined and relaxed into a life of electrical engineering, pizza and beer which I thoroughly don&#x27;t regret.<p>I&#x27;m worried my children will be similarly filtered out and recruited to be honest.",1395159187

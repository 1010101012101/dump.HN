9358553,comment,9357376,9357376,0,0,brudgers,,,"One of the things I learned quickly when I became a philosophy major is reading philosophy is a skill. I remember the sensation of realizing I had read six pages of Descartes <i>Meditations</i> and had been at it for an hour. Philosophy requires unpacking in some of the same ways a book about a programming language written without mercy for beginners will.<p>To a first approximation, if I am reading philosophy these days it&#x27;s Wittgenstein&#x27;s <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> unless I am looking for a reference [e.g. last week I looked at Putnam&#x27;s <i>Reason Truth and History</i> because I was thinking about the ant&#x27;s portrait of Churchill in relation to the role of interpretation of data. I&#x27;ll also find myself in Plato occasionally...though that&#x27;s often via the internet rather than the bound Jowett volumes.<p>Stretching philosophy a bit, I am these days often looking at logic and mathematics, and regretting a bit roads not taken. These have the same interest in accurate language I enjoy.<p>Anyway, reading philosophy as an investment sounds horrid. Read something you enjoy.<p>[edit] You might enjoy the philosophy bites podcast: <a href=""http://www.philosophybites.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.philosophybites.com/</a>",1428727945

I&#x27;m very disappointed to see Wired framing the story this way.<p>I am not a big fish lover. I don&#x27;t personally care about the Delta Smelt. But it&#x27;s going extinct because farmers took up so much of the freshwater supply for so long and then screamed whenever any water was diverted. You know, California also has a multi-billion dollar freshwater fish industry. The Delta Smelt is important not because it&#x27;s such an amazing fish but because it&#x27;s a good proxy for the viability of our salmon fisheries and others like trout.<p>This sort of zero-sum thinking is at the root of our environmental and political problems. We&#x27;re playing beggar-my-neighbor with increasingly scarce resources instead of saying &#x27;look, we have multiple stakeholders here with a variety of economic interests, and ultimately we are all in this together.&#x27; It&#x27;s very depressing >:-(",1428726119

And the answer is No, we&#x27;re not just flooding the network with a blast of packets. Apart from anything else, that strategy is full of fail for throughput anyway. Since a busy router will likely generously drop packets from the UDP queue before it loses stuff from the TCP queues.<p>So we rely on precise knowledge of network conditions at a fine grained level (the grain gets finer as we add more users to our network) to utilize the available bandwidth.  We also use other techniques to predict queue congestion on the network path <i>before</i> it gets to the level of dropping packets. Note that (most) TCP implementations <i>rely</i> on packets loss to discover usable link capacity. We don&#x27;t! One of the advantages of creating your own protocol is that you can use the state of the art research in congestion control strategies without being constrained by legacy concerns.<p>The upshot is, our protocol is actually fairer to competing traffic compared to TCP on the whole.

An entry in the card table corresponds to a 512 byte segment of memory in the old generation. Thus, the cost imposed by this would be based on how many distinct 512 byte segments of the old generation reference any objects in the young generation.<p>If you have a web service that mostly consists of some baseline of long-lived objects and many short-lived objects used for fulfilling requests, I would expect to have relatively few GC roots. At that point, if you assume that you have a consistent request rate, I would expect the number of reachable objects in the young generation to remain constant regardless of the size of the young generation, and the number of GC roots should also remain constant. Based on that, increasing the young generation size would then decrease the frequency of young generation garbage collection, reduce the probability of survivors getting promoted to old generation, and have no effect on the time it takes to do young generation garbage collection. There certainly applications that have different behavior when the old generation is less static, but I would think for this use case the new generation size should be as big as it can be.<p>If something I&#x27;ve said is incorrect or incomplete, I&#x27;m anxious to know.

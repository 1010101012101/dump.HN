Also, I love what Codeacademy is doing, but it's hard to delete all your work and start from scratch (which I find I need if there has been a long layoff between my coursework.)  Also, there aren't enough exercises/concept.  For me, I need 5-7 exercises to drill a concept into my memory, I get that it's new, but they should consider adding more exercises at each stage as they grow.  I'd also love to see a brick and mortar Code Academy that offers some form of certification after taking classes and passing tests (a more traditional education approach).

We need to have more open views when it comes to who Iran is and why they have the views they do about America and Israel. I know these are topics that no one would like to readily discuss these days, but the fact is that if we are potentially going to go to war with Iran or support Israel in a war with Iran, we need to know who these people are. Personally, Documentary Revolution thinks that it would be a terrible disaster to go to war with Iran, both for America and Israel, this documentary, we feel, does an excellent job at showing you the heart and soul of Iran, you can make your judgements and convictions about its people after that. But dont just watch the latest speculation news report on Fox news about Iran and take it as absolute fact. That does not do any of us any good what so ever.",1332818984

You guys drifted from one idea to another to another like a windsock. Then you suggested that you decided to pitch an investor about the idea you were ""passionate about"" that you got from a thread on Reddit, seemingly days before. See the problem here?<p>The other question I have is why you were so adamant about getting funding. If the idea is so good and people want it so badly, why seek investment? I don't mean this as a dig. I just don't understand why so many people wanting to start businesses work from the assumption that they need to make obtaining funding the end goal, and if they get into an incubator or get some investor money, they win. Nowadays, it seems like building a successful company is a process that is tightly guarded like entrance to an elite university, and if you don't get in, you can't succeed. In reality, there has never been a time as favorable for starting a purely tech-based company than right now. You can do in a few hours of work per week what used to take a team of full-time engineers several months. You don't need to invest in equipment or inventory. And yet, ironically, it seems that the companies that most desperately seek funding (and most often get it) are the companies that least need it.<p>That said, having advisers is another matter, and I know that having connections in high places is never a bad thing. My point is that I think the process described here, (and in so many articles on Mashable and TechCrunch) unnecessarily discourages people, and prioritizes the unimportant aspects of building a business.",1332818294

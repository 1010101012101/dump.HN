It seems to lock the OS as it tries and grab some system-wide resources (DirectX?). The cursor stops moving and mp3s stop playing for a good half minute.<p>The same happens with Windows Explorer. Even Firefox comes up quicker than Windows Explorer.",1181641186

Like pop-up blocking, it only filters out the stuff advertisers shouldn't be doing anyway. ",1181640317

It doesn't do the dictionary thing, but the dictionary isn't really OED anyway, it's OAD, which is different. In any event, you can use the services menu if you need it, or just do what I do and use Google. Camino 1.5 checks spelling with the OS X spell checker. It has built-in flash block and ad block if you want it. You can search you bookmarks in the app, but I don't know they're exposed to Spotlight. Probably not. You could use a Quicksilver plug-in, maybe. ",1181640105

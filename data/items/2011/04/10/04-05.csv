I'd suspect that the students interviewing now are, on average, not as competitive as the ones who received offers weeks or months ago.<p>I'd hesitate to stereotype startups' hiring preferences, but encourage students to apply to any company that's remotely interesting. Just like the bigger corporations, there's a huge variance: I've approached some startups about internships only to realize that their singular focus was to bring on full-time engineers ASAP, and worked for others that hired and mentored younger students with great success.

I used to do my projects in Rails because I didn't want to go through the hell of renting and setting up a server for ASP.NET. Also, MVC 3 has really flattened the learning curve and the expert community is finally putting together seriously good OSS and tutorials. Finally, MVC 3 development is also highly decoupled from a lot of the uglier MS attempts at making a totally proprietary stack (MS AJAX -> jQuery, Codeplex -> Github, Azure -> AppHarbor).",1302411428

Their pricing covers a large and growing set of features.<p>Microsoft's programs exist because of the insane amount of features and support that have to go into their products for their enterprise customers.

Usually groups can decide about that on the fly, or even in advance.  So most people either tell me yes or no when I call them, or call back a few minutes later.  But we don't have any deadline for replying, so if groups have some reason they need more time to decide, we always give it to them.  E.g. there was once a startup that we offered to fund that got an acquisition offer that weekend.  They needed weeks to see if the acquisition was going to happen.  (It did.)<p>2. It wasn't DST but the Start Fund, which is a separate thing. I believe those guys are going to invest again, but I can't promise anything, because it's not for me to promise.  A lot of people don't realize this, but YC was not a party to that deal.  It was just between Start Fund and the individual startups.  (We were in favor of it, certainly, but we didn't have any agreements with anyone.)<p>3. In years past I caved a few times when people tried to negotiate with me, but I haven't recently.  I realized I was just doing it out of fatigue at the end of a long day of interviews.  I've also learned from experience that there is near zero correlation between groups' tendency to negotiate and how well they end up doing.  In fact come to think of it, possibly an inverse correlation.  So it's easy to say no.",1302411079

You'll have free time, and you can put that time into starting a company. But first, you have to just play around with stuff, and you'll always meet people in any school. Find people who share your passion, because they'll help you continue forward. And keep doing stuff like FIRST -- it's fun, but it also helps you tackle problems well. If you start building stuff for fun that seems like it'll make money, you've found an alternative to school. But unlimited free time sounds fun, but I guarantee you'll be getting the same amount of work done if you go to school and work on stuff in your free time. You may even produce better work because you won't ""have the time"" to procrastinate.<p>But it's all a matter of preference. I'm not really any wiser than you.

Key word: ""my"" system. I need other .pbxproj files (or the .xcodeproj) to make sure there's nothing else I need to implement. The stranger your build process, the more targets you have, the better. Feel free to anonymize the file by stripping out the filenames, although in the PBXFileReferences, I do ask that you try to keep the filenames unique; it makes validation easier.<p>In the near future I'm looking into a couple of things: first and most importantly, methods to allow actual editing; right now it's pretty much just a parser (though it can write out too). Second, I'm looking into creating the classes and methods dynamically at runtime, as the parser encounters each one. There are promising preliminary results for some classes, the ones without references to others.<p>But first I need to make parsing as solid as humanly possible, and to do that I need more variety of project files than I've got currently.<p>Also, if you check it out and decide you want to contribute, that's awesome too.",1302410763

Extensive use of asserts in release builds terrifies me. It's meant to check for conditions that shouldn't happen, but I see users complaining about their apps aborting with assertion failures on ZMQ mailing lists and it comes up fairly frequently in Google. There are a fair bit of asserts for error codes returned from system calls. I don't want a critical process crash because I've used library in a wrong way in a completely different part of the application.<p>2. Only in 2.1 they've fixed the problem where some messages would not be flushed and be lost if you terminate the process too early. This seems like a fairly common bug for younger projects. Recommended workaround is... calling ""sleep"" before you exit, which is one of the deadly sins of multithreaded programming! This and above point convinces me that ZMQ isn't as mature enough for me to be comfortable with.<p>3. Transparent reconnection is good, but some of our applications need to quickly detect that other nodes in the system are missing, which forces me to implement off-band heartbeat mechanism.<p>4. Threading model seems a bit awkward to me (last I checked). First of all, let me state that I personally believe that a library starting threads behind your back is a Bad Thing (unless it's a framework). ZMQ uses a sender thread that you queue your messages into, yet it forces you to dispatch your receive loop by either blocking read or zmq_poll. If it already starts threads by itself, why not provide a callback?<p>5. Not really a problem, but a missing feature: no way to demultiplex messages from a stream of messages, so you have to implement it yourself. You can subscribe to a subset of messages on a socket, but can't subscribe to multiple subsets from a single socket.",1302410666

(BTW, not all of these startups are only looking to hire developers--a student looking for a marketing internship would probably do very well posting a video.)<p>I don't think, though, that a cover letter is a great test of these skills.  Cover letter templates are abundant and it's very easy for someone to basically copy and paste one in their application. Our team has read every cover letter sent through our site and we noticed some interesting patterns with them.  Initially, most students didn't really know what to put in a cover letter and they basically looked like form letters.  We created a few resources to educate students on what to write and placed links to them in the application flow.  This helped immensely (a lot more than I expected, honestly) and the quality improved.<p>Still, though, as an employer looking at the resums and cover letters of students, it's sometimes difficult to distinguish between candidates before doing a phone screen.  They have limited experience and skills to highlight.  We're trying the blog post / think-of-something-creative application process basically as an experiment to see what students come up with.  It's possible that by removing the constraints that students normally perceive on cover letters that something interesting will shake out.  You may think it a waste of your time, but you also aren't on the list of companies looking at these candidates :-)  Companies participating can opt-in with this expectation in mind.",1302410206

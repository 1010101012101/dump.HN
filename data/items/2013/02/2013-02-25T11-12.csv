- Kirk
- Dexter<p>These samples are picked for being quite different. While one might argue that Kirk is an improvement (cue the protest!), Bruce Willis has a very different voice and Dexter sounds so. damn. boring.<p>The production quality is usually alright. Still, depending on the content a lot of context/humor is lost and voices regularly don't match the original, at all.<p>Edit: For fun - someone on Youtube allows you to compare Bruce (and more.. ;-p) directly here [1]. So these voices are ~fixed~ in our heads as the normal voices of the actors. It's actually pretty hard to find non-dubbed content here (TV? No way, unless on discs. Cinema? Hardly. Some movie theater show originals, but usually just a very limited/blockbuster selection. And I'm living in/near a 1000000 citizen city here, so that's already the bright side).<p>1: <a href=""http://youtu.be/kc0NRc0qaws"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/kc0NRc0qaws</a>",1361793529

In the cases where you mess up, you can probably spot those by doing a second instrumentation pass after applying the optimizations (to see if any of them actually caused an overall performance hit).<p>It's nice to see that they tested this on a bunch of use cases, as well... and on that note, the adsense-serving benchmark spends 37.5% of its CPU time in memcpy!

Even states engaged in fear-mongering have things to fear.

They've been under embargo one way or another for nearly 30 years so they have experience in maintaing the necessary cash flow to pay their citizens and avoid major economic collapse.<p>Iran is quite an industrialised and high-tech nation with many skilled engineers. I know they look a bit bad when they release videos of model aircraft as fancy stealth bomber. But I have no doubt that they'd overcome such a situation.<p>It looks much worse for the Arab oil nations because they lack industry, skilled engineers or labour, or any kind of research. The financial market is a fragile thing and well Dubai is build on sand. We've seen in the crisis that nations with an industrialized base did much better than nations who were more focused on financial markets.<p>In Arab oil countries the situation is that large projects are designed by European, American, or East Asian engineers and architects and the construction is done by basically South Asian slave labour. In the end the building is left but nothing of the know how and skills that came with the project.<p>Another big indicator is the lack of a Saudi space program. Usually if a nation just has too much money a space program is a great way to boost engineering, science, industry in the country. Even Nigeria has a space program. Alternative would be a build up of the military. Which the Gulf states are clearly doing. But they import all their weapons from Europe or the US. Again no domestic research or industry. And military isn't really an investment. Once you try to reduce the budget the fighting power decreases dramatically and your past investments start to rot.<p>edit: My crystal ball is therefore rather showing negative picture. I believe there will be huge social unrest. It won't happen immediately but gradually. It will turn out similar to Egypt, Libya, or Syria. Currently the Saudis and Gulf states are using radical Sunni Islamists as a way to fight Shia Islam/Iran. They already used Islamism as a tool against Panarab Socialism but their current support goes far beyond that. And this will all eventually come back to them. There could even be an open war between Iran and the Gulf States.",1361792264

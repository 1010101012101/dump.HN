See the ""code"" section where Ruby has 2-3x less code. I won't disagree about Ruby being much slower than C# and Java. Ruby slow[er]ness has to do with it being dynamically typed, which also makes it expressive. If you are after something which is more expressive than C# and faster than C# see Scala on the JVM:

4285905,comment,4285157,4285329,2,0,talmand,,,"Exactly, my stance on software patents is that they do not necessarily cover the coder's method, it creates an entitlement to the result. Almost every software patent I've seen doesn't mention specific code, it just covers the result. Meaning no one can ever come up with a similar system without the threat of being sued for patent infringement. So, even if someone had a better way to make a similar system, they more than likely will get sued.

Most of the time it'll draw a few 10s of W, maybe stepping up as high as 100W+ when at full tilt (CPU & GPU hammering away, cooling fans on full blast, display at full brightness, all disks spinning & heads flapping, active drives or USB-powered cup warmers in every available port, ...). If you have (or have access to) one of those plug-in power meters give it a try without the battery connected: you might be surprised how little power is being drawn most of the time.<p>A laptop's power system is essentially a UPS: if there is no (or not enough) power coming in from the main source, flip to the battery. This won't be any different for this use: as soon as it wants to draw more than is available it'll see the under-current and switch over. The smoothing capacitors will ensure it can stay alive during the switch-over just as they do when you unplug the charger normally. If it is a little brighter then at times it might be be able to draw as much as it can from the external power and draw the excess from the battery, but I suspect no laptop is currently designed that way (they generally either get more than they need or nothing at all from the external source, so trying to be clever in response to getting half what you need would be over-engineering).",1343141044

Conversely, the ThueSiegelRoth theorem says that any <i>algebraic</i> number and any epsilon > 0, the algebraic number has only finitely many approximations with quality more than 2 + epsilon; so the ""quality"" values of successive best approximations are a series which converges to 2 from above.<p>This was how the first known transcendental numbers -- the Liouville numbers -- were constructed: They have approximations with unbounded quality, thus they cannot be algebraic.  In practice, however, this isn't a very useful method: ""Almost all"" transcendental numbers also obey the ThueSiegelRoth theorem.",1343140009

If people are expected to behave well, they tend to; and vice versa.<p>""Though of course forbidding bad behavior does tend to keep away bad people, because they feel uncomfortably constrained in a place where they have to behave well. But this way of keeping them out is gentler and probably also more effective than overt barriers.""<p>Trying to set barriers to bad user behavior has been an ongoing problem.<p>In March 2011, pg wrote that Hacker News was still having user behavior problems, under the title ""Ask HN: How to stave off decline of HN?""<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>He wrote, ""The problem has several components: comments that are (a) mean and/or (b) dumb that (c) get massively upvoted.""<p>So the founder of Hacker News thought then that there was a comment voting problem: (a) mean comments were getting too many upvotes, and (b) dumb comments were getting too many upvotes, and (c) too many of the comments that got the most upvotes were either mean or dumb or both. Let's stop and think about what that means. That means that, according to pg posting as of last year, two more years after the article submitted here, comment karma scores were often NOT reliable signals of good comments, comments worth finding rapidly when skimming a thread. So pg changed the Hacker News software a few days later so that comment karma scores were hidden from Hacker News readers (they are STILL visible to each person who makes a comment, on his or her own comments). You can check the scores of each of your own comments. We can all READ comments to see which comments are the good comments. (Better comments also tend in general to thread to the top of discussions, with some other rules also influencing that evaluation as ""better."")<p>Checking the results of the software change involves empirical investigation. How do the highest-voted comments visible in the bestcomments list<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments</a><p>look to all of you recently? Are there fewer mean comments than two years ago? Are there fewer dumb comments than two years ago? Are the comments that are ""massively upvoted"" since the experiment began mostly comments that are reasonably kind and well-informed, helpful comments on the whole? In most of the treads you visit, do helpful, thoughtful comments seem to rise to a position of prominence, while mean or dumb comments gray out?<p>In my observation, after 1345 days here, and rather active participation on Hacker News, the comments have improved both in the threads I post in and in the threads I only lurk in. Occasional checks of the best comments page STILL reveal a lot of high-ranked comments that consist of one-liner jokes or whining about something, so the signal provided by upvotes still isn't perfect, but looking at the average comment karma score of some users I've been following for years suggests that comment karma is better allocated now than it was two years ago, which as I said is also my impression when I look at particular threads under submitted stories. There may be some more changes yet to make, but Hacker News has scaled up some more and still managed to emphasize quality of comments, which is not an easy thing to do.",1343138552

I suspect the same is true for databases - there must have been some technological progress, even if SQL itself hasn't changed. <p>And for CPUs, there are also special interest flavors (signal processors) that outperform the standard ones in special cases, but they don't make the ""generic"" CPUs superfluous.",1189165849

51623,comment,51519,51519,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think it is interesting that some people cherish the Amazon recommendations above everything, whereas others are fundamentally unhappy with it. Unfortunately I belong in the later category. Sure, sometimes Amazon comes up with something interesting to me, but in general it does not. I wonder if I am just too weird for a recommender system to grasp, or if it hints at the system still being very imperfect.",1189165373

51618,comment,51397,51444,0,0,ralphb,,,"""I'm convinced that the real money comes from designing good systems.""<p>This is also the thesis of ""The E-Myth Revisited"" by Michael E. Gerber, which I'd recommend given the above comment. It's an easy read that talks about developing systems not just for profit, but also in a way that is ethically sound to both you and your employees and your customers. The book speaks mostly about small retail franchices (an example of a hotel is also given), but it is easily applicable to other areas.",1189164062

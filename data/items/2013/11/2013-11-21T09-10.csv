Though Winamp eventually lost popularity, in the late &#x27;90s and early 2000s it was one of the go-to media players for listening to local music or radio streams. In 2002, Winamp&#x27;s maker, Nullsoft, was acquired by AOL for over $80 million in stock, where it&#x27;s remained in development until now. A Mac and an Android version were even released in recent years, though they never found the same fan base that its customizable Windows client did.<p>No reason is given for Winamp&#x27;s shutdown, but its popularity has certainly waned: simple, built-in audio solutions like iTunes are now ubiquitous across platforms, making Winamp a far more specialized app. In a retrospective published last year, Ars Technica reported that Winamp had existed for years on life support, but that those involved didn&#x27;t believe it was dead yet. Now that it&#x27;s nearly gone, those who want to relive old times should head over to Winamp&#x27;s site before December 21st, when it&#x27;ll no longer be available — its famous motto, of course, will always live on somewhere.",1385027917

6773895,comment,6773526,6773842,3,0,oleganza,,,"1. It&#x27;s easier to hide even the fact that you have some Bitcoins. When you buy some Bitcoins for cash from random people on the street and keep in different wallets (or even &quot;brain wallets&quot;), no one would know how much do you have. In case of Swiss or any banking account, there&#x27;s always a paper trace somewhere. And recently US was cooperating with Swiss to uncover all accounts belonging to US citizens.<p>2. Even if someone knows that you have some bitcoins, they don&#x27;t know where they are stored and how keys are encrypted. &quot;Civil forfeiture&quot; or &quot;freezing account&quot; are very cheap and are used a lot. Irrelevant against Bitcoin savings.<p>3. Legal force is more costly than &quot;civil forfeiture&quot;, but then you can always multiple ways to preserve the money: by sending it to someone else you trust, by locking it up in multisig transaction with someone you trust (who is outside jurisdiction), by saying &quot;my hard drive has crashed&quot; etc.<p>In other words, the cost for anyone to confiscate your coins is much higher than with paper cash and even higher than with bank accounts.",1385027828

I would love if someone has a good article comparing what happens when you do a join on varchar vs text.<p>EDIT: One question remains, how is the &quot;text&quot; stored when doing a join. For varchar you just make an array, because all values are the same length. With &quot;text&quot; do you first find the longest text and use that as the default array element size?

It was in the end of the 1990s and ICQ ruled internet chatting and mp3s was new thing.<p>I used Winamp everyday. We shared music from dorm to dorm on the campus network. Everyone had Winamp. Parties had a dedicated Winamp computer with all the playlists with music available from the campus network.<p>We searched the net with Phoenix (now called Firefox) or Opera to find all the album art work. We installed beautiful Winamp skins and was amazed at audio 3d-visualization plugins that Winamp offered.<p>Winamp was early on handling multiple audio cards. I had dual audio cards, one just for Winamp connected to my HiFi equipment and the other for the rest of the Windows sounds connected to the computer table speakers.<p>Early with global hotkey support. Plugins that showed GUI popups of the music playing. Fraunhofer codec support. And it was super fast.<p>And I still remember the uproar when Winamp 3 was released. True fanboys stayed with  the Winamp 2 release for many years, the classic.<p>Sad this has to end, but Winamp never successfully adopted to a world with full fledged media library players like iTunes or Windows Media Player. Back in the day we used Windows Explorer (or Norton Commander) to cataloged all our music and soon a community based naming standard convention of music was &quot;created&quot; by mutual agreement.<p>And then came music streaming.<p>Bye Winamp!<p>// A pro license owner",1385024516

144856,comment,144793,144840,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"+1<p>The first thing I ask of anyone interviewing with YC: Do you have a demo?<p>If you don't have a demo, you're going to have to describe your vision in a very short span of time and under pressure.  Your demo, presumably, won't be shaky or easily confused by pg's questions (which I was pretty much always thrown off by, as they weren't the things we came in expecting to answer or talk about), and will just work.  Even a mockup is better than having nothing, though not by much.<p>Having a demo exhibits so many things that are impossible for them to really judge in any other way.  It shows you're committed to the project enough to spend some of your own time on it.  It shows you're capable enough to build the things you say you're going to build (or at least a reasonable start on those things).  It shows that you've thought enough about the idea to produce a prototype, which gives a much better view of the workability of the concept.  And, finally, it helps them to understand what the heck you're talking about--they're hearing dozens of pitches on the interview weekend, and will be far more likely to remember what you're doing, if you show them than if you merely tell them.",1206385053

But at some point, regardless of what your parents did, you have to take responsibility for your own actions and try to make something of your life -- or not.<p>By the same token, dysfunctional rich kids into drugs and other methods of squandering wealth are so common that they're a cliche. Maybe their emotionally distant parents are to blame too.<p>Regardless of how they got there, at some point you have to just acknowledge that some people have useful survival skills for getting ahead in society, and some do not. Also, that virtually anyone who isn't actually mentally retarded has some ability to develop those skills if they want to strongly enough.<p>This leaves you the option of modeling these skills as obtainable, which means that you create incentives for people to get their sh*t together, and the option of modeling these skills as innate and beyond anyone's control, which means that you just support people who drew the short straw and don't bother with incentives.<p>I think it's pretty clear which of these models contributes to wealth gain over time and which contributes to welfare dependency.",1206384695

The opera browser is pretty good IMHO and it has some outstanding features that people may enjoy but it just doesn't have firefox's plugin support or the wide acceptability and market share of IE. If everybody used opera, everybody would probably continue using opera just how if everybody used firefox, they would continue using firefox, and how now that ~80% use IE, about 80% continue to use IE. Browsers and pretty much anything on the internet run into a phenomena known as network externalities. It is a situation where switching costs are so high that once a user is committed to one choice, they stick to it. Opera is just in the wrong market at the wrong time. This is also why firefox's progress is so amazing. Fighting network externalities is very tough (see ipv4 vs. ipv6).",1206384061

It takes courage to be autonomous, both from the individual and from the group around that individual.  Teddy Roosevelt said it:<p>It is not the critic who counts, nor the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done better.  The credit belongs to the man actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly ... who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.""<p>Life itself requires audacity to be truly alive.  Audacity, as you pointed out needs no boss - no coach, no manager.  It needs more than anything, freedom and respect from others.

Each of these four sources of capital has slightly different implications for entrepreneurs. In this post, I will discuss the implications of a family office funded VC.<p>By family office I am referring to one family’s private capital. In this scenario the VC firm is essentially working for a very wealthy family to enhance the family’s personal endowment.<p>Capital Constraints
Some of these VC funds can have a relatively limited amount of capital under management. Since they typically don’t raise capital from third parties, they can only invest what the family allocated to them. Furthermore, once that’s invested they have to wait for a company to be sold in order to have access to more capital.<p>One risk in this situation is that if the fund has invested a large proportion of their assets under management they may not have the resources to continue to support your company in future rounds. The takeaway is that you should take a look at their balance sheets before accepting an investment.<p>At The Mercy Of The Family

144790,comment,144497,144689,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"This is a good hypothetical. I like it. The ""easy"" win in such a procedure is to decide which debater is self-consistent. Unfortunately a consistent argument based on faulty premises yields false conclusions. However, since we're allowed to look at past debates for context, I think we can sidestep that issue. We need to determine which past debate-winning arguments led to objectively advantageous actions. This is a non-trivial problem. Let's additionally sidestep it by allowing the human being to weight outcomes based on past arguments.<p>Aside: Are we defining a 'settled' debate as one where the resultant action came from one side of the debate over the other, or are we additionally taking into account whether we consider the outcome of said action is positive or negative?<p>I think that it would be simple to identify logical arguments (well, fallacies anyway) which imply that the position being asserted is actually untenable. Identifying arguments which satisfy the inverse - that is, that the style of argument correlates with an advantageous action as a result, falls back into the trap where false premises lead to false conclusions.<p>Aside: I wonder if there are arguments where objectively false conclusions still lead to advantageous actions? Now there's an interesting question.<p>I suppose that if you could semantically dissect an argument and then correlate its structure against weighted outcomes of previous arguments this system could yield intriguing results. I would very much like to see what logical constructions correlate with poor outcomes. Perhaps it would reveal self-defeating human tendencies, or arguments which push aside rational behavior?<p>Then again, the strength of the Bayesian filter approach is that it is dumb. It doesn't have to do a semantic analysis. So we avoid going down the path of strong-ai or special-cased rules when using it. Does the purely textual content of a debate correlate strongly enough with the semantic content to distinguish between good arguments and bogus ones? I think the only way to tell would be to try.<p>I suspect that many of the most vigorous debates would end up revealing that the relative advantagion or bogosity of a given argument correlate most strongly with what your individual desired outcome is. Then we've just led ourselves to the question of which outcome is superior to the other.<p>Thanks for an interesting few moments of introspection!",1206381815

The problem is that I don't want to spend any time thinking about nor running a news aggregator site.<p>And no, Web 2.0 is not ""the dominant outlet for most hackers to practice their craft"" -- it is the dominant outlet within the self-selecting set of hackers who follow Paul Graham. For the most part this means web developers in their early 20's -- which is also Web 2.0's core audience.<p>I didn't intend the question seriously, it's more just to poke fun at the Web 2.0 centric stories that appear here. It depresses me that this site focuses so <i>incredibly</i> much on Web 2.0 and not on science/software in general. If the site wasn't so damned Web 2.0 centric, neither of the Quotably stories would have made it to the front page. I'd say 95% of Web 2.0 stuff is made just to appeal to other Web 2.0 enthusiasts and not really to any large audience. I'm not saying that there shouldn't be niche stuff to serve Web 2.0 enthusiasts -- just that it's disproportionately large.",1206381726

Often times URL's contain some superfluous flags that don't change the content served, but just serve to log some referrer or layout type data (I'm sure everyone reading this site gets how this works).  Adding, removing, or changing any of this data seems to pretty much break or confuse whatever dupe-detector logic exists.",1206381626

The whole tech industry is about extending our human capacities beyond our natural limitations, fitting low-testosterone entities (aka women) into ""fast moving markets with high competiton""* for the sake of equity [and to show the rest of the world just how awesome we are] is just another obstacle we want to overcome.<p>*I guess this makes it sound more manly and heroic than it actually is.",1360493983

But Scala has a way powerful type system in a way that I doubt Kotlin and Ceylon are barely approaching.

5196065,comment,5195676,5195991,16,0,vidarh,,,">  If farmers are permitted to replant seeds then how are companies making the seeds supposed to make money ?<p>Since when does people have a <i>right</i> to make a profit, even if their business plan is stupid?<p>> But why develop it and spend millions on R&D if everybody can copy your product for free ?<p>Because if you're not a totally evil bastard, you can still make a massive amount of money by creating a brand that ensures people trust you to always give them the best product?<p>How many people do you know that buy brand name Ibuprofen, for example, despite the fact that Boots, who found the compound and commercialized it, has not held a patent on it for decades? In fact they sold off their own premium brand (Anadin) a while back and now competes with their former brand with cheap generics that often costs a tenth or less of what Anadin charges for the same chemical compound, and still makes money off it despite competition from dozens of manufacturers.<p>It's possible some types of research would not pay without artificially jacked up prices like this, sure. Boots certainly would have made <i>less</i> from Ibuprofen without a patent initially.<p>But if these Monsanto seeds are so effective, then this patent acts as a de-facto tax on a whole range of foods, as unlike Ibuprofen, if they are effective enough to affect competition, ""everyone"" will need them. If they're not, it doesn't really matter if the R&D hadn't happened.<p>If it already acts like a tax, we might as well bring it under democratic control, and lose the competition distorting downsides of an artificial monopoly, by using already well established avenues for public funding of research to handle any shortfall in R&D funding from curtailing patent rights.<p>The agriculture industry is one of the largest recipients of government subsidies in the world as it is - shifting even a small percentage of those subsidies into funding R&D to make advances in seeds available to farmers cheaper would probably pay off.",1360493925

These character flaws do not affect their ability to ""get the job done"", but I'd rather not work with them and take steps to avoid doing so when possible.<p>From a link in the article:<p><i>Renowned conductors have asserted that female musicians have ""smaller techniques,"" are more temperamental and are simply unsuitable for orchestras</i><p>I think that ""simply unsuitable for orchestras"" is vague and unquantifiable, but ""smaller techniques"" and ""more temperamental"" seem like assertions that could be challenged.<p>I have a general concept of what ""smaller technique"" means, is this something that is difficult to measure in a standard audition? Do female musicians in fact have ""smaller technique"" in general?<p>Are female musicians ""more temperamental"" than male musicians in general? Is there a male equivalent of a ""diva"", if not does that support the assertion that female musicians are more temperamental? Can you determine how temperamental someone is from a blind audition? Is temperament a valid reason to not hire someone?<p>To me, these senior conductors, scientists, etc. are asserting that, in general, women differ from men in certain dimensions that factor into hiring decisions but are not detectable in initial screening process.<p>If you really want to end sexism, I feel like these sorts of questions need to be asked and answered. My observation of the subject is that many people have an intuition, gut feeling, opinion formed from personal experience, etc. that men and women in general have innate differences that make men (or women) more suitable for certain  functions.<p>The ONLY way that gender bias will ever end is to challenge these ideas and in fact show that these innate differences do not exist.<p>On the other hand, if gender differences do exist, then fighting gender bias is an eternal struggle that will never end. It is human nature to min / max and game the system.",1360493866

The type system guarantees you have considered both possibilities so there's no such thing as a runtime null pointer dereference.<p>On the other hand, you end up with deeply nested code and it is hard to follow.  I did some grepping on clang and rustc, and in clang the rate of blocks within other blocks decreases (the deeper the nested block, the less chance of it having a sub-block in it).  In rustc the rate is constant, no matter how deep the nesting you have the same rate of having sub-blocks.<p>Not having NULL and using pattern matching can eliminate NULL pointer exceptions, but the cost is code that is harder to read.

This attitude was probably transferred to academic titles at some point.<p>In Austria, which has even more artifacts of its imperial time, this title-mania was followed so diligently that even the wife of the doctor was called Frau Doctor until a few decades ago. Also, every academic title at least equivalent to a master's degree is still used with your name in any formal dealings (they will call somebody up as Frau Magister Maier in a waiting room etc.). In Germany, they do this only with PhDs, so there is Herr Doktor but not Herr Diplom Psychologe.<p>Judging from the mini-bios of authors on books, though, the Germans seem as title-crazy as Austrians. The guy who cannot call himself ""Diplom Psychologe Hans Maier"" on the title page of the book will almost certainly start his bio with ""Hans Maier is Diplom Psychologe ..."" because this way, he is only describing academic achievement (OK) and not using it as a title (not OK).

This is unavoidable.<p>Remember the early Mars missions that used the inflated-bag method? They had to expend a lot of fuel to slow down enough to safely approach the surface, at which point the air-bag method was used (and worked). But this only reduced the amount of fuel required to get to the surface, it didn't significantly change that cost and burden.<p>Just do some numerical orbital simulations -- see what happens when you slowly reduce the velocity and altitude of a craft orbiting the moon so it is able to graze the surface. See what happens when you impact the surface at shallow angles. Hint: the craft's velocity is still extremely high and the air bags have to absorb too much energy -- they will self-destruct.<p>In a hypothetical approach to a perfectly smooth plains area (the moon has plenty of those), in which there are no altitude irregularities and the craft can approach at nearly orbital speed and impact the surface at a very shallow angle, the craft would begin to roll along the surface at such a high velocity that the centripetal forces would tear the craft apart.<p>Speaking as a former NASA Space Shuttle engineer.",1360491729

They work the same way like in Windows, for 9/10 times, they fix things, but on the 10/10 You end up with totally broken system that even can not boot, and like with Windows: ""With minor problems reboot, with major problem reinstall.""<p>That never happened to me on the FreeBSD land every upgrade/update of the FreeBSD's base system succeed.<p>There are other distributions You say ... yes there are, but which ones? Linux Mint is basically the same as Ubuntu, but with different default GUI and with some more codecs loaded in by default. I also have an allergy to anything that Lennart did, so for example Arch Linux is dead for me because it uses systemd and pulseaudio. Fedora 'the Lennux'? No thanks.<p>The whole Linux ecosystem seems broken to me because of all the things explained here: <a href=""http://www.pappp.net/?p=969"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pappp.net/?p=969</a><p>Also, I do not longer want to go back to OSS vs ALSA discussion, where OSS from the FreeBSD base system just works for me with everything I do and ALSA does not on so many ways.<p>I do not want to 'flame' again the 'initrd' mechanism in Linux where some drivers are in the initrd and some other are in the kernel and others are in the modules, but modules are not for initrd but just kernel, the kernel and initrd is under /boot but the modules are under /lib/modules /... this is just plain mess for me.<p>On FreeBSD You have one directory with kernel and modules /boot/kernel period. No other subkernels like initrd just to boot and then pass the machine to the 'real' kernel.\nUsing FreeBSD on the desktop requires knowledge and experience, and that makes it hard to use as a desktop/workstation. PC-BSD tries to change that, we will se how far can it go with it.<p>A lot of people ask, why You use FreeBSD when there is Linux?<p>I would ask the opposite, why You use Linux when there is FreeBSD?<p>I have here ZFS with latest 5000 version, yes, this is the next version after ZFS v28, this is ZFS Feature Flags.<p>I have ZFS Boot Environments with sysutils/beadm, the same way as it works on Solaris (even better), so I can create a bootable snapshot and destroy everything in my system, even rm -rf /* but after the reboot I may choose to boot from BE created just before that disaster and ... nothing happened.<p>I do not use DTrace, but many probably do. Jails are very nice thought. I already spoken about OSS in the base system, I already written about deterministic and reliable upgrades. I can also repeat the 'known' properties of FreeBSD like great documentation, great community, a very logical attitude in OS mechanisms and filesystem hierarchy ...<p>FreeBSD is no panacea to all operating systems problem, it has its own issues, the FreeBSD team has a lot of less resource (and hype) then the Linux world, but taking all the 'cons' and 'pros' its a lot less painful to use FreeBSD then to use any Linux.<p>If You are interested in FreeBSD desktop workstation, then check these:\n<a href=""http://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?t=35308"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?t=35308</a>\n<a href=""https://cooltrainer.org/2012/01/02/a-freebsd-9-desktop-how-to/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cooltrainer.org/2012/01/02/a-freebsd-9-desktop-how-t...</a><p>... and I do not want You to see this comment as Linux bashing, these are just my thought about using Linux and using FreeBSD.<p>Regards,\nvermaden",1360490445

5195955,comment,5195676,5195885,3,0,lutusp,,,"> You don't patent things, you patent methods.<p>That may be true now. There was a time, not so long ago, that a patent was denied to any idea that had not been reduced to practice, in a working physical embodiment:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_to_practice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_to_practice</a><p>Quote: ""In United States patent law, the reduction to practice is a concept meaning the embodiment of the concept of an invention. The date of this embodiment is critical to the determination of priority between inventors in an interference proceeding.""<p>(I hasten to add that the above rule about priority no longer applies. Because of recent changes, the U.S. is changing to a first-to-file system.)<p>Quote: ""A 'working model' is usually a strong evidence to demonstrate actual reduction to practice. Unlike patent models of the 18th and 19th century, a working model is no longer a requirement of the U.S. patent law.""<p>All this has been swept away by changes in the law, and we have the present patent system in which the patent office rubber-stamps virtually anything, and claimants work things out in court.",1360490424

7364273,comment,7349122,7352394,1,0,matchu,,,"I agree that, if the SAT were ideal, there&#x27;d be no way to prepare for it in particular.<p>However, a nationally standardized test must have consistent scores to be useful, and currently the best way to do that is to keep the general format and content consistent. That means that a student can discover and prepare for the test&#x27;s general format and content in advance, which is definitely advantageous.<p>A truly ideal SAT would have a different format and test wildly different skills every time it&#x27;s issued in order to defeat the idea of test-specific preparation, but still produce meaningful scores. I&#x27;m skeptical that such a test can produce sufficiently consistent scores, though I&#x27;m very willing to someday be proven wrong by some clever test developer. That&#x27;d be pretty neat.<p>So, until we create an SAT for which test-specific preparation is meaningless, it&#x27;s important that test prep resources are distributed evenly so that students with good educations won&#x27;t have artificially lower scores due to unfamiliarity with the SAT&#x27;s standard format and content.

When the younger coaches saw the ancient contraption, word got out on twitter, and my dad was past capacity for his talk. Many of the youngest coaches had never even seen an overhead projector!<p>By the time his talk was over, he had drawn (we might say derived) his ideas right in front of them, adapting to the questions that came his way. Most people said they really enjoyed the more interactive style my father taught in contrast to the stale power points of some other presenters.

But it seems to me to be an argument about <i>why</i> we keep humans &quot;in the loop&quot;, as it were, and less about what tools you give the humans.<p>It does open some questions about how &quot;innovative&quot; one might want to be when developing a weapon, even for defensive uses.<p>It&#x27;s sort of unfortunate that nuclear physics made the gains it did, <i>when</i> it did, as a big part of the reason the U.S. ended up making the big push for the bomb, at a time when they needed all the resources they could get put into things like logistics for shipping materiel, was because of the fear that Germany might get it first. I.e., &quot;<i>if</i> someone will get the bomb, we&#x27;d better do it better they do&quot;.<p>I suppose the Cold War would have ensured proliferation one way or another, but WWII certainly did not help the cause of non-proliferation.<p>But either way, war or defense (whatever you call it) can <i>never</i> be a simple-minded optimized anything. It is almost the very highest level of human holistic competition.

I would consider that like telling a graphical artist, sorry no wacom, you can only use this 2 button mouse. Sure, they can likely improve their mousing skills over time, but what is the benefit?<p>I&#x27;m dysgraphic and have typed every school report in since 3rd grade, so perhaps my view is biased on this matter. I remember being unable to learn cursive and my teachers telling my parents &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, by the time he&#x27;s an adult everyone will type everything.&quot;. Their prediction has held true. Cursive is dead, removed from common core. Handwriting is up next. In my adult life, the only thing I&#x27;ve had to hand write other than my signature has been a few checks.<p>Forcing hand writing is like forcing modern day car drivers to only take a horse and buggy to work.

7364216,comment,7361824,7363081,2,0,roryokane,,,"You’re right, the “Install It” section should make that clearer. Anyway, there is an explanation of basic usage if you follow the link to “CLI” (<a href=""https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#cli"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#cli</a>) in that section. It says you can create a `metalsmith.json` file that lists source, destination, and plugins in the described format, and then run `metalsmith` from the command line to build your pages according to the configuration file. And I think you will probably also have to install any plugins you use beforehand. Plugin installation instructions are all in the plugin READMEs – they are basically all just `npm install <some-package-name>`.<p>But it’s harder to figure out how to create my own local plugins and make sure Metalsmith is able to see them. And the documentation should make it clearer how to <i>use</i> the JavaScript API, in the context of a static file generator, where most people are not thinking about writing a program. It took me a bit of thinking to realize that you would have to create a `whatever.js` file inside the directory containing JavaScript code with `Metalsmith(&quot;.&quot;)….build()`, and then just run it with `node whatever.js`.",1394252152

(Most of the advanced nSpire dev is done on a french-language site that I can&#x27;t fully understand through Google Translate).<p>That said my nSpire CAS CX is pretty kitted out even in the TI Kernel with overclocking, file readers, etc. It even runs Doom!<p>I&#x27;m actually amazed that the SAT allows nSpire CAS calculators on their tests (The ACT does not). Apparently the SAT&#x27;s defining factor for approval is a non-QWERTY keyboard to prevent note input, despite the fact that the nSpire platform allows notes to be transferred to the calculator even before you sideload third-party utilities onto it.<p>The CAS system also allows pretty much any problem to be solved without complex problem manipulation.  Most SAT tutors urge students not to solve algebra on calculators because they invariably make mistakes when transforming functions for solver(), but the nSpire&#x27;s algebra functions will do all kinds of transformations and solve multi-equation functions without much work. You could even solve a lot of geometry problems with the (built in!) geometry program if you forget theorems, and a little competence with things like modulus will take care of the rest of the test without any human computation (though this is slower than solving on your most of the time)",1394251326

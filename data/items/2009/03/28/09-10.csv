536342,comment,536112,536112,0,0,swombat,,,"A very loose set of criteria that ignores the fact that programmers can exist at different levels of expertise, and can be adept at non-programming activities too.<p>For example, I don't see how being able to navigate office politics is a sign of a bad programmer. Nor are confidence, strong will and ""inner peace"" anything to do with being a good or bad programmer.<p>Verdict: not worth reading.",1238233606

Goals can be bugs squashed, features added in, performance gains, whatever you need. Its yours to mold when you start for the day and destroy when you end for the day.<p>If you're at a more established company, then chances are, they'll care about things getting done, but on a day to day basis, will have a different metric to use. Which is the angle you're coming from, I think.",1238233346

536335,comment,491196,491196,0,0,guglanisam,,,"I believe this list can be brought down to just two basic (not just one):<p>- Customers: Understand them, improve their lives, get them to pay regularly, get them to spread the word\n - Costs: Keep them as near to zero as possible. That will enable you to be profitable even with minimum number of customers<p>During the first year of your startup don;t worry about anything other than the above two. Special warning:  Dont spend anytime on external fund raising, fund raising is the most distracting thing for startups and something where you have least control and very low odds, unless you accomplish something ""of value"".<p>If you can get thru the first year with a complete focus on Customers & Costs and hit break even by the end of first year. I can guarantee that you on the way to build a successful company (not just a good startup)",1238232260

A false dichotomy is a rhetorical device to position your favored option against a rhetorically maligned strawman opposite option.<p>Given that no one actually wanted ""drones feeding me with ""programming, , your statement is not very persuasive.<p>The <i>actual</i> options are about <i>preferences for</i>  ""insightful"" articles about marriages, children etc vs  ""insightful"" articles <i>centered around</i> programming, technology, startups etc. On <i>this</i> choice, people can (and do) differ, and that is perfectly fine.<p>""If you felt pity for such people who did not have a good appreciation for dynamic nature of all things nature, then think a bit more""<p>more putting words is my mouth.

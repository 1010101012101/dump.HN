I was playing around with loading up some comic books for an upcoming trip.  A nice directory structure of .cbr files on my computer is mangled beyond repair when turned into a flat list of files to add to a single app. The app (Cloudreaders) offers organization via tagging, but re-tagging 500 files is untenable. The iPad needs to expose itself as a USB storage device that I can drag folders onto, security sandbox be damned.<p>No background processing is disappointing for a hacker like myself. I've been building an in-browser HTML5 audio library. MP3/M4A playback works extremely well on the iPad's Safari. Until you open a ""new page"" or jump out of the browser. Thankfully the current song doesn't stop playing, but no Javascript events fire so the next song can't start.<p>I also do miss Flash for various reasons. Flash can extract waveform data from audio files to perform visualizations for example.<p>Battery life, blah blah blah, I need a computer I can hack and script.<p>I use Chrome and have my bookmarks synched across many computers, so Mobile Safari is a black sheep anyway.<p>I do get in the zone on my iPad when I'm reading some PDFs or comic books, watching ABC or Netflix, or playing pinball. The size and touchscreen and battery are amazing. So it's not all bad.<p>But it's a toy, not a real computer, and that's frustrating to a hacker like myself.",1275400650

1394952,comment,1394726,1394896,0,0,mmelin,,,"I agree - but given Google's scale, managing the relationships with these kinds of third party sites could be challenging indeed. Perhaps they could set up a system similar to Webmaster Tool's sitemap submission where you could upload structured data to Maps including links back to your site?<p>Regarding Sushikartan's revenue, it's not entirely clear but I believe there is no direct revenue from Ted's map sites (he has a lot of similar sites to Sushikartan). He has a few maps sites with partners which probably brings in some revenue, but I think it is a traffic and reputation that is the main goal. Ted already had an exit a few years back, moderately sized but very good for a one-man shop.",1275398209

If you want a digital sketch specifically, then it seems worth it to try with a stylus and a doodling or sketching program.<p>But Omnigraffle is not for drawing, it's for formalizing. Just like an outlining tool is not for thinking, it's for expressing what you've already clarified in your head.<p>Computers require you to formalize -- make decisions, order, and choose form -- totally prematurely.<p>I find pen & paper to be the best thinking tool there is because it's completely free-form.<p>If you want the next best thing to paper, try that stylus hack and a doodling program, not a tool like Omnigraffle.",1275398070

If you want to make sure that you picked the correct values for those properties and if you don’t yet have copy, you should use Lorem Ipsum. Text is certainly not just a visual element but it is also a visual element.</i><p>The important point is that lorem ipsum is <i>not</i> content, rather, it is a tool for approximating the aesthetic of content that <i>might</i> be placed there in the future.<p>Nobody is saying that design begins with fonts/layout/color (although that does happen at times), rather, that when you get to a point where you need to decide how bodies of text will look, you use things like lorem ipsum to approximate how other text will behave within that field.<p>The other thing about lorem ipsum, which you may be missing and the op certainly misses, is that by not actually being english, you don't get hung up on the meaning of the content, rather, you can pseudo-objectively evaluate the aesthetic choices used to set the text. again, the whole point is to create a template for setting actual text very well.<p>the largest problem with lorem ipsum is people using it who don't understand <i>why</i> they are using it. I think that using dummy copy that <i>looks</i> like legitimate content is more harmful than using random latin. At least with real latin, you don't delude yourself into thinking that it's anything other than text used to decide formal typographic or layout choices.",1275397787

7029459,comment,7026960,7026960,7,0,pseingatl,,,"Not so long ago, this collection would have been priceless. 10-15 years ago there was an article in Wired about efforts to obtain access to case law, which was pretty much locked down by West Publishing and Lexis/Nexis. So a few comments:<p>1) To make this set usable from a practical point of view you have to know when it starts and finishes. &quot;[E]very federal court ruling&quot; is a bold statement. Federal Reporter Third? All 1000 volumes of F2d? What about the original Federal Reporter? F.Supp.? Not all federal district court decisions are published. Since our federal courts have become criminal courts (starting in the 1980&#x27;s) most of the written decisions will be at the appellate level. What about &quot;Do Not Publish&quot; opinions? There are thousands of them and they are still useful. Usually only DoJ has copies.<p>2) Not having everything is not critical to the practical value of the set. In the 1990&#x27;s a West salesman would tell you that there was no need to buy anything before 500 F2d if you were trying to put together a small federal library. For most states they would try to sell you everything, except perhaps New York, California and few others. The issue is updating. Florida updates (or used to) its appellate decisions on a monthly basis. You could sign up and they would send you a zip file every month. I don&#x27;t know if all states do this. The problem of recency is a major one. A case could have been decided yesterday but you won&#x27;t find out about it for a month. You can fix the problem on appeal--theoretically, assuming a client who wants to pay--because judges will not, except in rare cases, revisit older decisions they have made because case law that was not available at the time was dispositive.<p>3. The issue of citing to a particular page of a decision in addition to the official citation is not a huge problem. In many states, appellate decisions are relatively short and court rules have provided for the use of just the official citation. Cites to new Westlaw and Lexis cases do not have page numbers. When page numbers are unavailable, you can cite them as (  U.S.   )(2014) [my Blue Book syntax is probably a little off here). If you cite an unpublished opinion you normally have to provide the judge and your counterparty a copy of the decision.<p>4. FLITE was the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s effort to computerize case law in the 1980&#x27;s. Westlaw and Lexis fought ferociously to prevent this database from being released to the public. They were successful. The same is the case with JURIS, a DoJ caselaw database. Now there are several providers (such as Fastcase) which compete with Westlaw and Juris. Access to PACER, the U.S. courts database of case, is limited. Efforts to mass download the database have been frustrated. The courts use PACER as a revenue tool. Also, criminal cases at the district court level are not on PACER (unless this has changed) supposedly to protect informants. So it would be interesting to know how this database was obtained.<p>5. Putting aside the practical value of this database, once the extent of the content is established, it could have real value for researchers. Could it be used to spot trends in the law? I wonder what might be shown if tools to measure things like historical market performance were used to analyze the database. You could see all sorts of data points for terms like &quot;Dalkon Shield&quot; or &quot;asbestos&quot; occurring within specific time ranges. There is definitely a &quot;me too&quot; aspect to the law. And while judges make law all the time, they have no control (usually) over the cases brought to them. Do cases involving &quot;terrorists&quot; match the pattern of cases involving &quot;communists&quot;? Or, say in the period 1910-1920, &quot;Germans&quot;? On a practical level, what is the statistical incidence of cases involving the Statute of Frauds? The &quot;ancient document&quot; exception to the hearsay rule? Are criminal conversation causes of action really coming back? If historically the incidence of data points A, then B always led to C can an analysis of such points today of any use in predicting future decisions?<p>Just a few thoughts.",1389257696

Torrent files were already small, but now they use magnet links which are basically just a SHA1 hash and a URL for a tracker. The tracker isn&#x27;t strictly necessary.<p>Here&#x27;s a fun trick: Make a plaintext file containing &quot;Hello world&quot; (maybe lowercase, maybe either will work). Take its SHA1 hash. Paste that into the Transmission &quot;Open torrent address&quot; dialog (edit: It looks like you can only directly paste hashes into the web dialog. You can still craft a magnet link manually).

Ak47 is certainly not the most accurate weapon, but in a real life situation and within its fire range of about 350 - 400 meters it&#x27;s accurate enough. In my experience with the Yugoslav version m70 it&#x27;s really hard to miss anything under 200m and when shooting further than that (because it doesn&#x27;t have optics in the standard setup) your eyes are a bigger problem than the gun itself.",1389257587

They even wash each other&#x27;s dishes. It&#x27;s very social.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why pay-per-minute would lead to this. Doesn&#x27;t that mean people are paying to wash other peoples&#x27; dishes?",1389254503

Sometimes active placebos are used, as in the magic mushroom studies at Johns Hopkins (I believe they used a stimulant). But even people who&#x27;ve never used psychedelics can probably tell whether they&#x27;ve taken speed or hallucinogens.<p>I didn&#x27;t read the study in depth, but the problem you describe is widespread and well-known. Well-known doesn&#x27;t mean solved, so perhaps you have a better solution?<p>One option might come from clever experimental design, in which subjects do not know the hypothesis you wish to test. The problem is that this is often guessable - i.e. here subjects might not have known that AP was being tested, but they might have believed mental performance was, and if they thought they were in the treatment group they might have extra confidence, which could confound the results. That&#x27;s hard to design around in practice, though.",1389254470

The exception of writing and executing user-entered code could be called out, but I don&#x27;t view that as a requirement of a &quot;personal computer&quot; but rather a &quot;general-purpose computer&quot;. Oh, sure, we geeks think they&#x27;re the same thing. But most users of C64s that I knew didn&#x27;t, at least judging from how they used their machines (i. e., not writing code).",1389254446

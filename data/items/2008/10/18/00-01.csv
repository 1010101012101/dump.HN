336142,comment,335815,336068,0,0,prospero,,,"<i>Money is a proxy for other evolutionary factors. Is there are a good reason to disagree with this?</i><p>Yes, there is: wealth doesn't imply a greater number of offspring.  Survival is a relatively low economic hurdle, as is raising and nurturing children.  By asserting any real similarity, you're conflating survival with some modern concept of success.<p><i>Here's a statement: On average, the wealthy are smarter, prettier, and taller, than the not-wealthy. Do you disagree with that?</i><p>I agree that wealth is a social signal.  It might even imply things that aren't immediately apparent (though you'll know someone is tall and attractive before you'll know they're rich, most of the time).  But even the facile comparison of a peacock's feathers and a rich person's designer clothing doesn't really hold water in my mind.  I think a lot of our evolutionary urges might be sublimated in our struggles for success, but that doesn't make them the same things.",1224289247

But I never ever want to be famous.<p>One of my great fears would be having complete strangers (not founders, not YCers, not HNers) regularly recognize me. Starting your own business, no matter what it is, certainly causes some loss of privacy, but I'd prefer that 100 years from now no one gives a shit about who I was or what I did.

His suggestion for government is particularly laughable:<p>*My suggestion is that this great man start and sponsor a forum for great minds to come together to create a new system of government that truly represents the common man's interest, while at the same time creating rewards great enough to attract the best and brightest minds to serve in government roles without having to rely on corruption to further their interests or lifestyles.",1224288297

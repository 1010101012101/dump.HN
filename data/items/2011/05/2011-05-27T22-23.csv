I cannot keep running Python 2.x indefinitely without maintenance because knowledge of its flaws will slowly escalate until it is a security risk to keep operating it. If this doesn't happen to the tool itself, then it will happen to one of its critical dependencies, like an old version of SQLite it requires, or the previous generation of OpenSSL.<p>Projects like Python, that simply don't care about maintenance costs of things that rely on it are simply being naive: they are pretty much saying ""yes, you invested a ton of time into building code for Python 2; but those days are over: we, at some random shifting date in the future, are going to drop support for this, so if you want to get security updates to it, or hell: even upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu with minimal pain, you now need to drop everything you are doing and reread all of that code to update it for our seemingly arbitrary changes, retesting the whole thing in the hope of finding any regressions you introduce; that, or go off-grid, maintaining this code and related infrastructure yourself"".

So that's fine, but once you start getting into Monte Carlo simulations and massive batch processing, event filtering, instrument calibration, and all your database connections and all sorts of other stuff, it honestly just doesn't scale up or provide a complete solution.  So you end up doing some in MATLAB, some in C, some bash scripts, some in whatever else.  Python gives the flexibility at all stages to solve all that in one or two languages (C/C++ for optimization, python for everything else).  I do know chemists that use MATLAB, but not the computational chemists on the big clusters.  Most the solid state physicists I know use OriginLab, LabView and even Maple or Mathematica all on Windows and proprietary stuff like that, usually because they are hooking up to various instruments.

I'm making progress, and it's building up to a fairly nice subset of org-mode, but it's not something that would satisfy any truly hardcore org-mode power user.  At least not any time in the near future.<p>The previous poster complained that none of the Vim plugins that try to mimic or clone org-mode ""seem complete"".  That is definitely the wrong way to look at things.  Org-mode is a huge app that's been heavily developed for six or seven years now.  In some ways org-mode is probably like Microsoft Word: probably 75% of its users access only about 25% of its features, although many of them access a different 25%.<p>Why try to develop an org-mode clone in Vim, then?  Mostly as a personal project I started for fun.  I tried switching to Emacs just so I could use org-mode.  Even with Viper and Vimpulse add-ons Emacs felt too clunky to me.  I had previously worked on a Vim outliner and I knew that part wouldn't be too hard to replicate in Vim.  I decided not to stop there and I've gone on to a lot of other features, although it's a fledgling project.  In particular, I need to get some decent documentation done. There are a ton of features in my clone that users have no idea are even there.  I think so far most of them (like most org-mode users?) use it mostly for simple outlining.<p>The Vim clone uses a file format compatible with org-mode and actually calls out to an Emacs server to have org-mode do exports to LaTeX/PDF, HTML, etc.  So pure document authoring (as opposed to PIM/task management stuff), is one task that the Vim clone probably can do a decent job of now.  Adding footnote support is on the list (there's already a Vim footnote plugin that I plan to modify to work with the org-clone).",1306534738

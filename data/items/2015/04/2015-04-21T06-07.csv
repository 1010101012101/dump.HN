9412588,comment,9412494,9412554,0,0,geofft,,,"That&#x27;s certainly part of it, but at some point there&#x27;s a qualitative shift: if you make certificate lifetimes short enough, you don&#x27;t need to bother with revocation lists at all. Since CRLs are unwieldy no matter how you do them, standard practice for revocation is OCSP, preferably through OCSP stapling, where you carry a signed response from the CA (valid for about a day) saying that your certificate hasn&#x27;t been revoked. Effectively this is just a more complicated way of getting a new certificate about every day.<p>The other part is that, if something about a cert turns out to have been a bad idea, it&#x27;s much better to only have to wait a few days or even months than to wait a few years. &quot;Something&quot; could be the algorithm (precisely why Chrome is yelling at SHA-1 certs that will still be valid in 2017, even though there&#x27;s no attack as of right today). It could also be certification practices: if the community decides that, say, certificates without the `subjectAltName` extension need to be deprecated because the CN field is underspecified, nobody&#x27;s going to want to do revocations for that. So you are stuck waiting until all current certs expire and get renewed to follow current best practices.",1429598635

At the most obvious, a comment saying justt &quot;I think you&#x27;re wrong&quot; clearly expresses a position that at least one person disagrees with, but is also almost certainly non-constructive, and potentially abusive in the form of being disrespectful. If you have arguments, make them. If the person you&#x27;re arguing with made an argument, give the phrasing of the argument the benefit of the doubt, and engage with it as if it is a serious argument. (And if there&#x27;s no way to do that, then <i>their</i> comment should be downvoted, because it&#x27;s non-constructive.) To do otherwise is disrespectful of the person you&#x27;re replying to, as well as to the community of people reading comments.<p>A lot of times I see people making repetitive and poorly-informed comments that also happen to be disagreeable on the merits. They&#x27;re relevant, they toe the line of &quot;non-abusive&quot;, but they don&#x27;t belong.

It got two replies: one person explaining that they were aiming to, and one person saying that, of course MS would never do such a thing. The latter comment got downvoted a fair bit. I&#x27;d imagine most of the people downvoting disagreed on the facts, since the comment happened to be wrong.

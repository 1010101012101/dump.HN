No matter what product you have, if you don't market it, it's the same as if you didn't have it. Marketing is Google's other name, they are a marketing giant. There's an awful lot of extremely talented people floating in the wild, who are not under mega-labels because the mega-label business model only allows a handful few. Imagine what could Google do with its marketing power and this available talent - they can literally create a new mainstream music industry almost overnight.<p>Regarding annoying of customers - when fascism was on the rise in Germany, lot of people should have been annoyed but they were left in ignorance, and that's why eventually Hitler succeeded in the takeover, before turning the country to ashes.<p>When your government breaks the law, and then under the disguise of copyright infringement they take down any website that reports about it, the last working piece of the responsibility feedback loop is completely destroyed, the citizen is fucked, and the country eventually ends in ashes.
That is the true danger of SOPA, and that is what SOPA is <i>all</i> about.",1325204574

KType is an iPad app to improve communication for individuals with speech & motor disabilities. When I talk to people, I actually mention Hawking as the most famous use-case and that while he can have the best engineers and computer scientists work on his device, very few devices are available for my late grandpa who had stroke or cousin who is paralyzed from an accident and can't talk. I'm making KType for them. Kinda funny to see Hawking looking for assistance with improving his systems. Wonder how I could show him a demo of KType :)<p>My end goal is to turn KType into an integrated box like Hawking probably has but make it easy enough that anyone can set it up. I've seen old specs of his system but that was long ago. I wonder how good the word completion/prediction is. I built my own standalone prediction algo based on data-mining 10m tweets and can search through 1m words and phrases on the iPad in real-time as the user types (you can see that in the demo video). Here's how I mined the Twitter data: <a href=""http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20110209"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20110209</a><p>If anyone's interested, I could write how my algo works. I'm quite certain that it is significantly better than typical smartphone auto-suggests and it was quite an engineering challenge to make it work on the iPad (bit-counting and bloom filters and tons of optimizations).

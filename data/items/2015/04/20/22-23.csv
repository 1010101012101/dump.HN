He is happy to run down his rules for me.<p>“First, it starts with an expression of ‘Hey,’ ‘Oops,’ ‘Excuse me,’” he begins. “Second is a personal statement: ‘I’m a hustler, baby,’ ‘I wanna love you,’ ‘I need you tonight.’ Third is telling you what to do: ‘Put your hands up,’ ‘Give me all your love,’ ‘Jump.’ Fourth is asking a question: ‘Will you love me tomorrow,’ ‘Where have you been all my life,’ ‘Will the real Slim Shady please stand up.’”<p>He takes a deep breath, and rattles off another four rules. “Five is logic,” he says, “which could be counting, or could be spelling or phonetics: ‘1-2-3-4, let the bodies hit the floor,’ or ‘Ca-li-fornia is comp-li-cated,’ those kind of things. Six would be catchphrases that roll off the tip of your tongue because you know them: ‘Never say never,’ ‘Rain on my parade.’ Seven would be what we call stutter, like, ‘D-d-don’t stop the beat,’ but it could also be repetition: ‘Will the real Slim Shady please stand up, please stand up, please stand up.’ Eight is going back to logic again, like hot or cold, heaven or hell, head to toe, all those kind of things.”  The ninth rule of hit songwriting is silence.<p>[...]<p>His favorite example of a song that uses the most rules in the fewest words is a hit by the rapper Ludacris, “What’s Your Fantasy,” which starts off with the lyric “I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes.” Caren loves that song. “In the first line: a personal statement, ‘I want to,’ a stutter, repetition, ‘li-lick you,’ logic, ‘from your head to your toes, move from the bed down to the down to the, to the floor,’” he explains. “‘I gotta know’—another personal statement—and asks a question, ‘What’s your fantasy?’ So he’s got six of them, in the first two lines of the song.”",1429569739

I&#x27;m happy to answer questions here.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to track which 3rd-party libraries your apps include, especially in a large company and across acquisitions. If one of those libraries is vulnerable, how does its vendor (or open-source author) find the relevant developers and notify them?<p>At SourceDNA, we&#x27;re constantly indexing mobile apps and analyzing their code. On March 30th, we were able to look up which apps use AFNetworking (over 100k in the whole store), select those which were updated recently (20k), and then list which ones had the vulnerable code (AFNetworking 2.5.1, about 1,000 apps).<p>We just finished an update scan yesterday to see how well developers have been fixing this flaw. We were shocked to find that while 250 apps have been patched, the total number of vulnerable apps has risen to 1,500! Our theory is that these apps were being updated for other reasons and the development cycle is slow enough that the flawed code from Feb-March is just now appearing in recent releases.<p>We&#x27;re offering a service to developers. Sign up with your email and we&#x27;ll monitor your apps for you and notify you of flaws like this, as well as how to fix them. It is extremely low noise since we only tell you about flaws that affect your own code.<p>Check it out and I&#x27;d love your feedback:  <a href=""http://searchlight.sourcedna.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchlight.sourcedna.com</a>",1429568852

We started with procedural programming, then made a big shift to object-oriented programming, and now we&#x27;re starting to see a big shift toward functional/declarative programming.  Who knows what&#x27;ll be big next?<p>If this happens too frequently, then there are certainly going to be problems, yes.  The current trend, however, indicates that it&#x27;s not happening too frequently, at least not yet; the current shift from object-oriented imperative to functional/declarative programming (with some object orientation here and there, though this isn&#x27;t very pronounced in Erlang and its family tree) seems to be by necessity rather than adopting shiny for the sake of shiny, and I think that&#x27;s what makes the difference here.<p>Basically, the more dramatic the switch is, the more likely the switch to be a net gain rather than a net loss, since it indicates that the switch was truly necessary.  Switching from Python to Ruby, for example, would be a net loss, since - while they have different syntax and in some cases different programming styles and ecosystems - they&#x27;re both imperative scripting languages and you&#x27;re not really changing all that much besides a bit of syntax and semantics.  Meanwhile, a switch from Python to Haskell, for another example, is more likely to be a net gain, since you wouldn&#x27;t even consider that switch unless you felt the need for the massive paradigm shift that&#x27;s required to make such a switch.<p>As a disclaimer, my claims above are mostly conjecture, though I think they correspond well with reality, at least by my own observations.",1429568232

The conversion is done at compile time, so the compiler knows that a null pointer is the required result.<p>There is no requirement for an integer-to-pointer conversion to retain the bit pattern of the integer value, any more than an integer-to-floating-point conversion is required to do so.<p>In most modern implementations, conversions among integer and pointer types of the same size are trivial, simply reinterpreting the bits as a value of a different type.<p>A conforming C or C++ compiler can use, for example, the bit pattern 0xFFFFFFFF to represent a null pointer. Converting a constant 0 to a pointer type would yield a pointer with the representation 0xFFFFFFFF. Converting a non-constant 0 to a pointer type does not necessarily yield a null pointer; the result is implementation-defined, and may be indeterminate garbage.",1429567884

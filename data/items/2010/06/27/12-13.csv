(It's also in Co-NP, if I remember correctly.)<p>If P=NP, and somebody has shown a polynomial algorithm for any one problem in NP [1], then we can construct a polynomial algorithm for IP.<p>Of course, getting a good polynomial algorithm for IP would still be an interesting problem.  E.g. bubble sort is polynomial, but far from the ideal sorting algorithm for most applications.<p>We also have lots of algorithms to solve IP already, that work well in practise for many types of problems.  But all of them become slower than polynomial for certain pathological inputs.<p>Interestingly, no polynomial simplex algorithm (for continuous linear programming) is known, but in practise simplex often performs faster than most polynomial algorithms for solving LP.",1277643589
1465433,comment,1465001,1465001,0,0,Goladus,,,"<i>Scientific Method</i><p>Honestly I would not call this one a misconception.  In fact I'm pretty close revising that section or just removing it altogether.<p>The ""textbook definition"" is simple only in that it is <i>abstract</i>.  It's not rigid at all, in fact it's extremely flexible.  If what you are doing can't ultimately be described by the scientific method then what you are doing is not science and you probably shouldn't pretend that it is.  Paleontology, and astronomy, for example, still involve observation and hypothesis, even though many predictions cannot be tested with existing technology.  Just because discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered accidentally doesn't mean it's not an empirical observation.<p>Yes, reality has more details.  But in my experience, so many people fail to understand even the simple scientific method that worrying about the realities of how actual professionals practice science is rather silly.",1277643573

1465425,comment,1464116,1464319,0,0,fexl,,,"The rationale is that the type declaration demonstrates how you use the variable.  For example:<p><pre><code>  char *(*fp)(int, float *)\n</code></pre>\nYou now have a variable called ""fp"".  Follow that pointer by putting a * in front of it.  Call that function by passing it an int and a float pointer inside parentheses.  Follow that pointer by putting a * in front of it.  That gives you a char.<p>Same kind of thing here:<p><pre><code>  char *strings[10]\n</code></pre>\nYou now have a variable called ""strings"".  Index that array by putting an offset less than 10 inside square brackets.  Follow that pointer by putting a * in front of it.  That gives you a char.<p>Here's a simpler example:<p><pre><code>  char *str\n</code></pre>\nYou now have a variable called ""str"".  Follow that pointer by putting a * in front of it.

In an iterated game, possibly with more than two players, enlightened self-interest could make people seek a reputation for fairness and generosity.<p>Also -- have you looked at the ultimatum game?  It works like this: Alice proposes how to split a dollar between herself and Bob.  Bob can accept the division, and both get paid out by the game, or Bob can reject, and nobody gets anything.<p>Real Bobs tend to reject `unfair' proposals, even when the game is not iterated.  That's not rational (at least within the game).  So if Alice where driving as hard as she could go with a rational Bob, she won't get anything when playing with Humans.",1277642710

We have a definition of raven that's independent of its colour, otherwise we wouldn't be able to tell whether a particular thing is a raven, and thus, whether its colour is evidence for anything related to ravens at all. However, we don't have a definition for all non raven things, so the number of non-ravens is not merely large, as the article suggests, it is in fact infinite as counting needs definition to tell one thing from another. Drawing conclusions by induction from one of an infinite number of instances seems meaningless to me.<p>But there is another interesting question that arises from the Bayes explanation at the bottom of the article. If we had all things in the universe available and sufficiently defined to tell what is one thing and what is another, and we found that there are indeed no non-black ravens, that would still leave open the question of whether there could possibly be non-black ravens in the future. They could be born right in this moment, so there would be a race condition between making the statement and the statement being falsified by the event of a non-black raven being born. And I think that's one of the problematic things about purely extensional logic advocated by philosophers like Quine.",1200254367

Sitting at the computer for 8 hours is pretty boring if you think about it (and occasionally butt-cramp inducing).<p>I work on two computers that are spaced slightly apart, requiring me to frequently push myself from one to the other on my little rolly-wheel computer chair.

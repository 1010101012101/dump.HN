A typical way to write such applications to do less buffering is to do select() or poll() or equivalent followed by a large non-blocking read, and then picking your data out of that buffer.<p>As pointed out above, if this &quot;benchmark&quot; does ping/pong&#x27;s in lockstep across a single connection, then buffering vs no-buffering will make exactly no difference, as there&#x27;s no additional data available to read. But in scenarios where the amount of data is larger, the time saved from fewer context switches quickly adds up and gives you far more time to actually process the data. Usually your throughput will increase, but your latency will also tend to drop despite the buffering as long as the buffers are of a reasonable size.<p>Buffering is a problem when the buffers grows to large multiples of the typical transaction size, but for typical application level protocols that takes really huge buffers.",1375808146

After all, all energy spent on movement can&#x27;t be spent on gaining weight.<p>Also, cows bred for their meet are slaughtered at 7-8 months of age. If cared for, a cow could live for 20 years, but economics prevail.<p>Cows held for their milk have it a bit better, as they get to live for 5-6 years. Also, things have improved. For example, the milking robot not only improved yield, but also allowed each cow to select the time it wanted to be milked, and does not require farmers to chase their cows towards their milking place two or three times a day.<p>Not kept in buildings: That depends on the level of industrialization of the farms and on the quality of your grassland.

The mass of air above the wing is moving into a larger physical volume, so it spreads out to a lower pressure. Bernoulli showed that pressure and flow velocity are always related (for non viscous flows), so where you get a low pressure you&#x27;ll also get increased velocity.<p>The &quot;to catch up&quot; part is wrong, as well as the idea that it&#x27;s the &quot;longer path&quot; that makes the air speed up. A symmetrical airfoil still generates lift as long as it has some angle of attack.<p>Now, there is one complexity here in that air isn&#x27;t totally inviscid. It does have some viscosity, and this creates some complex boundary layer effects and turbulence. So the Bernoulli explanation is a bit of an approximation. The &quot;real&quot; math is Navier-Stokes, but that&#x27;s not useful to most people for understanding flows based on looking at formulas (it&#x27;s the math that underlies computational simulation of fluids but nearly useless with pen and paper).<p>A better &quot;highschool textbook&quot; explanation is the concept of circulation, which captures most of the important details without requiring you to understand tensors and vector calc.",1375807502

This is a problem of finding a general rule, not just a particular design that is stable or unstable.<p>The issue is that no one has found a way to characterize all possible designs (within certain constraints, such as two wheels each attached to a rigid frame, the frames joined by a hinge) which are self-stable. They know some conditions that are necessary, such as at least one factor linking lean to steering and the design needing a steering force applied to turn in a steady turn. They have not yet characterized what conditions are sufficient for a stable design.<p>What you want, to say that you fully undertsand how a bicycle works, is a set of conditions which are both necessary and sufficient for a bicycle to be self-stable. If you build a bicycle which meets those conditions, then it will be self-stable (at some speed; certain designs may be self-stable over a wider range of speeds while some may only be self-stable at a narrow range of speeds); if you build a bicycle which does not meet those conditions, it will not be self-stable at any speed.<p>We&#x27;ve gotten closer over the last century; initially it was believed that gyroscopic force was necessary, but that was disproved. Later it was believed that trail was necessary (or either gyroscopic force or trail was necessary; I haven&#x27;t read the older paper), but that has now been disproved. We now know a couple of necessary conditions (listed above), but they are somewhat weak necessary conditions, and we don&#x27;t yet have (as far as I know) a set of sufficient conditions (conditions which, if they hold true, will guarantee that the bicycle will be stable, regardless of other changes to the design), beyond a few known designs which are demonstrably stable.<p>In fact, if you follow from the paper in Science to the &quot;Supplementary Online Materials&quot; (which is actually the full-length paper; what&#x27;s published in Science is really an extended abstract), you will see that they prove that &quot;no combination of positive gyroscopic action, positive trail, or positive steer axis tilt are either necessary or sufficient for self-stability over at least a small range of speeds.&quot; They construct models of bicycles that lack each of these things but are stable, and have all of these things but are unstable.",1375806431

So, you can measure the velocity of that packet of stuff by seeing how much the line is shifted.  Since you have a lot of photons, you can do this independently across the Sun&#x27;s surface and get a spatially-resolved map of velocity (&quot;Dopplergram&quot;, <a href=""http://solar-center.stanford.edu/dopplergram.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://solar-center.stanford.edu/dopplergram.html</a>).<p>If the little packet of stuff was in a magnetic field, its spectral lines will be split into sub-lines due to the Zeeman effect.

We have found brilliant ways to cultivate food at minimum cost, but it is not securing the majority of our species food intake.

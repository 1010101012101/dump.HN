174390,comment,174298,174326,0,0,izaidi,,,"Montreal seems like the place to be if you're starting small. Vancouver might have a stronger talent base but their startup culture is a little top-heavy -- it's mostly VCs and angels spinning off their own ideas, whereas in Montreal there's a vibrant startup community and VCs are actively seeking early-stage concepts to invest in (like here: <a href=""http://montrealstartup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://montrealstartup.com/</a>). And yeah, it's a beautiful city and housing is really cheap. I'd move there if I could but the only startups looking to hire talent are the well-funded ones in Vancouver.",1209228647

Vancouver Film School and Emily Carr add to the art talent.<p>Since we have universal health insurance, and a fairly decent social safety net, it is actually cheaper to provide benefits to your employees in a lot of cases.<p>Vancouver is an expensive city to live in.  But definitely not as expensive as the valley.<p>The infrastructure is good.  I can get a 50Mbps internet connection in my apartment.<p>The women are gorgeous and fit.  Skiing, sailing, golfing, climbing, hiking amenities are close by.<p>Yeah, it drizzles for 4 months of the year.  But you get used to it.<p>The VCs are very approachable.  Send any of them an email with the subject header, ""30 Minute, no harm, no foul meeting"" and they will hear you out.<p>If you're trying to get from zero to fundable, check out my friends over at Bootup Labs.

If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are separate programs, so the license for the main program makes no requirements for them.<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main program and the plug-ins. This means the plug-ins must be released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license, and that the terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins are distributed.<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication between them is limited to invoking the `main' function of the plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline case.",1209228044

174373,comment,173916,174052,0,0,hugh,,,"If it makes you feel any better, I guess you're performing a valuable service to society. You're keeping the market working the way it should by ensuring that stations with slightly lower prices get less business than stations with higher prices, which helps keep the prices down for the rest of us. So in addition to those one or two dollars of savings, you should also get the warm glowy feeling of being a public benefactor. Congratulations!",1209227073

Self-selection bias, self-deception (i.e., what one perceives of one's self and what one actually does are almost always different and often wildly so), and self-disclosure bias (i.e., what one wants (others) to believe about one's self).<p>The entire analyst industry is basically built to do this.  Of course, they tend to be ridiculously biased because they are getting paid so much for their opinions. Finding friends who work at places that already have the reports is one way to get them. :-)<p>In terms of actually useful data... Look for information about the users' and customers' actual behavior -- i.e., where the user/customer actually had to do something real like visit repeatedly, pay money, recommend you to other people, etc.  As a number of folks mentioned at SUS, if you don't have information directly relevant to your play then look for various proxies and triangulate.",1209226947

While the concept for market research is going to be the same, the methods used to gather that research need to be tailored in order to achieve the best results. Anyone can poll 1000 people and ask them what they think, but if 900 of those people do not understand your market or would not find a use for your product/solution the chances of gathering useful data are minimal.  Can you provide more specifics as to what your target demographic is or what your product is?",1209226402

To be honest, I have no idea how to sanitise Hex encoded input, in either MS SQL or MySql od Postgres.<p>The important part seems to be the fact that MS SQL allows ""query stacking by separating the queries."" Does this mean you can input multiple queries without using a semicolon (which you'd normally escape if you're not using a prepare statement) in MS SQL, and thus this is how the injection worms its way into your DBMS?<p>Besides, what does he mean by""by separating the queries""?

1605549,comment,1604583,1605248,0,0,Retric,,,"A true public good (non-rivalrous and non-excludible) would in effect need to be completely subsidized.  The closest real world example would be pure research which in the real world is paid for by the government or non profit seeking organizations.  IMO, GPL code is close, however it is somewhat rivalrous  in that only a few branches will be maintained, and insuring code which best supports your organization is in the main branch has value.  EX: Google does not want an add blocker to be installed in Firefox by default.<p>However, that's not what is generally considered a subsidy. A targeted tax break on wind farms is the the class of activity I am talking about.  When governments directly provide services there is little incentive to increase production beyond what is useful and significant incentive to cut back production.  However, with farm (food) subsidies there is by definition overproduction which prevents non subsidized actors from competing and distorts consumption.<p>PS: Thanks, I should have been more clear.",1281894971

The common goal is ""less journeys"". The difference seems to be in the way to achieve that. He wants to tax those who commute, you, it seems,  might want to give incentives to companies to move to suburbs or to let employees telecommute, or to have some kind of tax incentive  for employees to move to the city.<p>Whatever method is used it will take decades to make a difference and it will be very unpopular. Making parking $70/day like it is in London in some garages, would destroy Los Angeles. It is a city that is so car centric and pedestrian unfriendly that it would completely cripple it.<p>I personally hate Los Angeles for that reason.

1605529,comment,1604963,1604963,0,0,davi,,,"This touches on my area of research. The 'pyramid' idea of brain function is essentially a straw man to jazz up the Science Daily article. It's been known for a long time (a century) that recurrent loops occur throughout the brain. The mystery is what these loops do, given the apparent hierarchical buildups of representation that seem to occur in sensory systems, particularly the visual system. (Also in the hippocampus, e.g. place cells, and other areas in all likelihood.)<p>I haven't read the paper thoroughly (<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/07/28/1009112107"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/07/28/1009112107</a>), but looks like the authors are using a strategy of systematic and tightly circumscribed injections of anterograde & retrograde tracers to map out, with unusually high precision, the inter-areal projections for a particular circuit they're interested in. This mapping of inter-areal connectivity is a little different from what I'm interested in, which is to understand how the many-to-many anatomical wiring diagram between <i>individual neurons</i> in a neuronal network relates to the transformation of information carried out by that network. In other words, they are mapping connections between areas, but I think it's likely that an additional level of resolution -- the mapping of connections at the level of individual neurons -- will likely be necessary (and probably insufficient) to crack brain circuits.",1281894491

1605521,comment,1604583,1604583,0,0,Empact,,,"A number of the comments confuse removing artificial subsidies of driving with applying artificial fees to driving.  These are existing artificial subsidies, which force non-drivers and marginal drivers to pay heavy costs on behalf of drivers:<p><pre><code>  * Drivers don't directly pay for the full cost of roads, e.g. through a gas tax\n  * Minimum parking mandates force non-drivers to include parking for their home\n  * On-street parking is often far cheaper than the market would demand\n</code></pre>\nYou could ask, what's the problem with these subsidies?  They change behavior in a systematic way which leads to bad results (sprawl & congestion).  For example, for someone who has access to public transit, the mandatory construction of a personal garage via minimum parking requirements becomes a sunk cost, which I don't have to consider between the two options, whereas a market decision would include that substantial cost in the calculation.<p>You could address the bulk of Cowen & Shoup's points by simply:<p><pre><code>  * Raising the gas tax to cover the cost of road construction and maintenance\n  * Removing the mandatory minimums on parking spaces for new developments\n  * Charging closer to market value for existing meter parking\n</code></pre>\nThese measures aren't social engineering - they're in support of the idea that the real costs of driving ought to be borne by the driver themselves, and that non-drivers should be unburdened by the imposition of driving costs.",1281894231

What if Apple said that artists from the MCA label couldn't play on their MP3 players.  Now all of a sudden you have a music label that is being blocked from being played on the most dominant MP3 player in the world.  Apple, with its monopoly power, could not effectively control which labels flourish and which don't.  Of course, they don't do such a thing, and it would be near impossible to implement, but the example shows their strength.<p>And it doesn't matter that other players existed and prospered (although I'd argue that none prospered before the iPod).

It would be easy for them to stifle video providers.  The case I picked is a very obvious one since AT&T sells telephone service and fancies itself as a net cable-tv operator.

1605433,comment,1604504,1605108,0,0,nileshk,,,"> Window Max & Min buttons randomly work depending on the application<p>In OS X I rarely use these buttons.  ""Minimize"" is very rarely useful.  If I want to get an app out of the way I use Hide (CMD-H).  Hide Others (CMD-Option-H) is also useful for making the current app the only one visible.<p>Minimize is only useful to me when I want to get a window out of the way within an application (but not get the application out of the way).  For example, lets say I had multiple Terminal windows open, and there was one that I knew I wasn't going to use for a while, and I didn't want it to show up when I cycle through windows when I hit CMD-`, then I would hit CMD-M to minimize.  (This is hypothetical, though, I don't use Terminal that way.)<p>I admit the ""Zoom"" button (what you expect to be Maximize, but isn't) is rather inconsistent due to apps having different opinions on its usage (iTunes being one of the worst).  If you want Windows-style maximize, you can use something like shiftit ( <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/shiftit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/shiftit/</a> ) which gives you a keyboard shortcut for it.  It also gives you Windows 7 style tiling and more tiling features.  I have a fork of this open source project where I'm experimenting with being able to resize windows to percentages of the screen size using keyboard shortcuts: <a href=""http://github.com/nileshk/shiftit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/nileshk/shiftit</a><p>Also, checkout this company's non-free products: <a href=""http://irradiatedsoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://irradiatedsoftware.com/</a><p>Going back to your previous post, I think Windows 7's taskbar misses the point (assuming it's trying to copy OS X).  What is nice in OS X is the whole app switching model.  In OS X, when you click on an app in the dock, you are switch to that app bringing up all the app's non-minimized windows, whereas in Windows you are always switching to a specific window but not to the app as a whole.<p>While I use OS X's dock, I use QuickSilver to switch to apps even more, which gives me a more precise keyboard-based way of navigating to the app that I want, where I can literally switch to an app that I want without looking at the screen (more that I don't have to study the screen in this process, which makes it faster for me).  Spotlight can be used similarly, though it doesn't handle Finder the same way as Quicksilver (can't switch to Finder with Spotlight).  I don't use Expose because I find it takes to much time to find and pick out the window I am looking for.<p>Honestly, it took me 2 years of owning a Mac before I preferred it over my previous preference (Linux).  I think it's a mix of the fact that it is a UNIX and the polish and little details of OS X (there is a lot to both it's form and function).  It takes time to appreciate, because it is significantly different than other popular environments.<p>I'd like to know what is so great about Windows 7, but my experience with it so far has made me think it is just another Windows with some eye-candy (which is not to my taste) and some decent Window tiling features.  But I have not been able to give it an honest chance, because one of the .Net projects I maintain requires XP.",1281892033

Generating HTML in this way is very productive if you're doing the layout and backend coding yourself. Traditional templating languages are a better fit when working with designers who will not want to read/write Python though.<p>However, I do feel the syntax is a little heavy compared to similar non-python libraries. It would be nice if it could be done with less characters - there is a lot of repeated 'p' and 'html' which pollutes the code. I have no idea if this can  be improved upon in Python though.<p>Also, I'd recommend a big lovely README on the github page as people may end up there not having read the blog post.",1281891992

The abstract starts off with <i>MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper.</i><p>If you lack that feature set, then you can't solve most of the problems that MapReduce is actually used for in practice.  Conversely if you have that feature set, then you can, though not necessarily with good reliability or at optimal speed.  Therefore that description is what I take as the canonical description of what it means to have implemented MapReduce.<p>As for your arguing that I am not a true software developer, guilty as charged.  I've been joking for years that I am merely a profitably displaced mathematician, and my current job role is a weird cross between software development and system administration.",1281891839

The marginal cost of getting an Android phone over a normal one is $30/month for the data plan, so $720 in America and I guess $1080 if you're in Canada (that sucks, btw). And then you can probably subtract $50 or $100 or so because you'd probbly pay a bit more for an unsubsidized iTouch-oid than for the subsidized phone.",1283288332

1650798,comment,1650564,1650704,0,0,jerf,,,"There's two ways to look at the issue. One is the question of value generated by the degree. If the degree adds a million dollars to your total income, it is natural for the education industry to try to capture more of that value. By that metric it all looks peachy.<p>In a free market, the relevant metric is something more like at how low a price you can bring the service vs. your competitors. It beggars the imagination to believe that the current price charged is the actual minimum price for the services that people are actually looking for. The question of the intangibles of the college experience is incidental, first because even those intangibles can almost certainly be had for much cheaper, and secondly because it isn't necessarily the case that people want them, regardless of how much you want people to want the same intangibles you do. In addition to the fact the intangibles could probably be had for cheaper, we have this Internet thing slowly but very, very surely eroding away the physical constraints of the old system.<p>They've been really shielded from the free market by easy subsidies and loans and the fact that the unaccredited competition was neither socially accepted nor able to be quite cheap enough to break through, but all of these things are suddenly changing. The costs to a startup or something of providing a college-quality education continues to drop, and the business scales fairly well. We're getting over the idea that college = good with the increasing evidence that it's not true, which will continue to open the door to non-traditional-college alternatives, some of which will begin to exceed their college breathren. The subsidies are likely to become harder to get and increasingly scary, as word of things like the non-dischargability of student debt in bankruptcy are increasingly well known. Every pillar propping up the current system is collapsing over the next few years at once.<p>As the college education market gets forcibly introduced to the free market, I expect the blood of the incumbents to flow freely. Like all bubble pops I can't predict exactly when it'll happen (""the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent""), but I'm pretty confident about the outcome, based on the fundamentals.<p>(How confident? I am not planning my finances for my kids on the assumption that college is going to cost them each $50,000/yr in 2010 dollars. I computed it once and at current rates of tuition growth that's a reasonable projection for a 2-year-old and a not-yet-born. It's just physically impossible for a college-equivalent education to cost that much. So you might say I'm betting quite a lot on this analysis.)",1283287081

We download nucleotide sequence and taxonomy information in a number of unrelated formats from a number of public repositories and run various kinds of translation and analysis on it. Much of what we write are small command line tools that search, summarize, or transform certain types of (large trees of) text files. These programs look and feel a lot like traditional core Unix utilities; our most widely used programs are essentially just a specialized version of diff and a specialized version of grep, respectively. We used to prototype most of our utilities as shell scripts or in Perl; we redid shell scripts in Perl or C (or sometimes Java) if they became performance bottlenecks.<p>Some years ago we decided to move from Perl to Python for new projects because Perl programs had a way of always ending up as maintainability nightmares and because Perl seemed on the way out anyway. It largely worked, but we were never really, truly happy with our Python code. I suspect part of the reason is that Python can be (or at least <i>feel</i>) less succinct than even C if you do lots of low-level file system stuff with close error checking. The true reason is probably largely aesthetic. We can't explain what's wrong, we're just vaguely uneasy.<p>What other alternative to C should we be looking at? Ruby? Haskell? Is Go there yet?

1650755,comment,1649963,1650312,0,0,todayiamme,,,"I firmly disagree. Those statistics are skewed and flawed in more than a few ways, because you see they reference themselves most of the times. Whenever, I analyze anything I can't go about referencing my own system's output as proof that my system works. I need to set up independent checks and balances to make sure that the output matches the tolerances I want. Beyond, the Indian census they don't have an independent data source to collaborate their claims, which is a logical fallacy I can't buy.<p>Let us analyze literacy;<p>The literacy statistics once you go into the document are counted by the number of graduates from this system, but in the system itself, more specifically, in the rural areas degrees can be bought and large scale cheating takes place. This isn't recycled third hand estimates, but the reality that even those who design the schemes know. Further, independent checks and analysis has not been undertaken to find out the validity of the statistics.<p>One of the most glaring examples of this are the educational institutions they have cited. Most of these institutions in rural areas exist only on paper and their funds are often mis-allocated by corrupt individuals. Obviously, there are no verifiable statistics available for this, but based upon ground reports from individuals and officers it's shockingly common.<p>If you actually see the data then you see a stagnation that has set in since the survey you cited (1998) and the 2001 Census. One of the interesting leaps was made between 1951 and 1997; the literacy rate increased from 18.3% in 1951 to 62% in 1997. This implies that an average increase of .95% in literacy was experienced by the population. Yet the 2001 census showed slowing down of the trend and over 3 years the literacy rate increased only by 2.84%.<p>It might seem like nothing but when aggregated over the large indian population then the numbers add up. However, it could be argued that this was just a minute deviation in the norm based upon outside factors beyond their control. The only way we can conclude this is when the results of 2010 Census comes out, but I would like to cite the report itself since it basically makes the same point;<p>>>> In 1942, the British Government instituted the Sargent Committee to propose a plan for eradicating illiteracy in India. The committee proposed a plan that would make India 100 % literate in 40 years. Indian nationalists scoffed at the plan stating that India does not have that kind of patience, and wanted quicker results. However, 58 years after that and 53 years after independence, our literacy rate is only 62 %. <<<<p>>>>The National Policy on Education (NPE), framed in 1986 and amended in 1992, accords priority to universalisation of elementary education, universal retention of children up to 14 years of age, non-formal education in the educationally backward states and thrust to the National Literacy Mission.<p>It states that "" the investment on education be gradually increased to reach a level of 6% of the National Income as early as possible"". In fact, several Government documents dating back to 1969 state this goal. The actual level of investment has remained far short of this target.<p>The Programme of Action of the NPE 1986 and as revised in 1992 states ""Time is of essence, and unless we act now, we stand in the danger of once again missing the opportunity of education reform, so critical not only for the development of our nation, but for our very survival"". It also mentions that ""it is people’s achievement in the education reconstruction which will make the real difference""<p>We have not yet succeeded in any meaningful reform and also having society’s involvement in the process.<<<<p>The summary is quite interesting;<p>>>>To sum up, India’s education system is highly skewed. India has excellent examples of institutions at all levels of education to demonstrate its capability. Some higher education institutions like IITs and IIMs have earned international acclaim.<p>But below this elite crust there is not much to speak of and the road ahead is challenging.<<<<p>----<p>The point I am trying to make is that if you define state disintegration as failure of the machinery of the government, then India isn't exactly in a healthy state no matter how you cut it. This isn't something about picking problems. It's about analyzing them and figuring out ways to solve it. However, before you can solve any problem you need to analyze it and this is precisely what I am doing.<p>>>>Your statements are too sweeping and repeat broad generalization without having any first hand experience.<<<<p>Whoa! Hold your horses I thought this was HN!<p>Yes, it's true that I am offending your nationalistic sensibilities and I apologize for that, but I need you to understand don't give a damn about patriotism. No offense, I don't get choked up about national anthems, flags and parades. As George Carlin would say they are symbols and I leave symbols to the simple minded.

I actually had thought about this same problem myself, though I am not nearly as invested as you are.<p>It looks like everyone agrees that in order for people to visit, they need to know what to expect.  Like when people visit a physical store, the store itself might not be particularly interesting, but the goods it carry is of interest to the visitor at a particular moment.  However, people visit more than stores.  We visit our friend's homes too, for instance.  What do we get out of that?<p>Why of course it's a relationship.  It doesn't really matter what you do together at home.  Maybe you do not even offer water to them when they come (bad).  They come because they have an interest in you as a person in one way or another.<p>Blogs are the same.  If you depend on search engine traffic then yes, you need to be an authority on some subjects.  Do remember, however, that everyone is an authority about him/herself.  Does Google Bot care? Maybe not (yet).  Do people care? Yes!  Why fight with a robot when your goal is to be read by people?<p>For this reason I think it is not helpful to rely on SEO if you are running a personal blog.  Find where people are, like online communities, social networks, and engage with real people.  I'm sure you can find a circle that can be your starting point.  From there, you may even get feedback that help you gauge just how popular or interesting you truly are, and build your character up so eventually, even Google Bot will love you.",1283285352

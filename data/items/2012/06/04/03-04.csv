On one hand they say that it's an ""older algorithm"" which presumably implies that the vulnerability is a simple software implementation bug.

What we found is that certificates issued by our Terminal Services licensing certification authority, which are intended to only be used for license server verification, could also be used to sign code as Microsoft. Specifically, when an enterprise customer requests a Terminal Services activation license, the certificate issued by Microsoft in response to the request allows code signing without accessing Microsofts internal PKI infrastructure.""<p>Interesting. The Microsoft Terminal Services CA has the corporate identity, but not the corporate trust chain.

I don't understand why because the truth is this (IMHO) is blatantly self-evident.<p>Even our machine learning models are capable of taking inputs and changing the internal structure creating or modifying the ability to make inferences. Why do you think our brains are any different?<p>When a conversation happens, at first you remember the exact words that were spoken. Soon you think you do but those details will change between different participants (they will in fact probably be different from the first moment for any non-trivial exchange). Then you're left with the gist of what was said and then later typically an emotion or association with a person, time, place or some other stimulus.<p>Books are no different. You may remember key quotes. After awhile you'll struggle to remember all but the broadest plot elements. Most often you'll remember that you liked or didn't like the book and often won't be able to quantify why (in any kind of specific way).<p>Reference books or books that teach you anything are more ""obvious"" in this regard. Read ""Effective C++"" or ""Effective Java"" and it'll essentially reprogram your brain (to varying degrees) by a change in habits, preferences, etc.<p>Fiction is harder to pin down. Sometimes it's pure entertainment. It may not necessarily change you. But there is something about human development that is particularly receptive to the meme of fiction. The greatest ability we evolved is the ability to teach our young significant skills such that one generation is building on the fruits of the last and we've all learned something beyond how to crack nuts open with rocks.<p>Fiction often has a moral. Books are capable of changing our behaviour and attitudes (although many don't).<p>All of this just seems so obviously analogous to reprogramming a computer (albeit an incredibly complex one) that it baffles me that people would think otherwise.",1338781262

Well in the case of Dreamweaver you have an audience that invested a great deal of time to learn a toolset. And while under the hood there are better ways to code, jumping from WYSIWYG to looking at lines of code is a real turn off if you don't do web production as your full time occupation. The other reason is that even by offering an upgrade path to other Adobe tools a certain percentage of users will leave Adobe when a product is discontinued.<p>Of course Dreamweaver is dead to folks who really do HTML all day, but I suspect that those folks never really used Dreamweaver back in the day or they stopped using it when CSS for layout started to become popular.<p>A key lesson that many of us can learn from this is that ease-of-use is really important to a non-tech audience.

Swap is considered equivalent to RAM?<p>From my experience, a single Heroku dyno performs better than a micro EC2 instance (613 RAM) but significantly worse than a small EC2 instance (1.7GB RAM). The first Heroku dyno is free, making it ideal for small sites, but as soon as you want to add anything outside of Heroku's sandbox, the prices are extremely inflated compared to AWS. For instance, adding an SSL cert to a Heroku app is $20. A small EC2 instance costs as little as $17.69 a month with 3 year buy-in (this is the average monthly cost with a 3 year heavy utilization reserved instance). Even if you pay monthly for an on-demand instance ($57.60/m) it's still much cheaper than Heroku considering you can comfortably run several services such as Redis, PostgreSQL, and Resque workers alongside your app. Each of those services will cost extra on Heroku.<p>Of course, the trade off is the relative ease of deployment. Heroku is the easiest place to deploy, until your app grows more complicated. AWS is 2nd easiest, until you need even more control over hardware configurations. The most difficult deployment is on your own hardware, but it should also be the cheapest option.",1338780122

Windows ME came next, which didn't really add anything big either and is remembered poorly. XP (see below) came out about 1 year later, making ME easy to forget.<p>By the time ME was out, Windows 2000 (which was not a consumer OS) was out and was fantastic. It was an amazing OS. Since it was from the NT line, it was amazingly stable. NTFS was much more resillant than FAT32. It was much better at handling memory than the 9x series. By the time I started using it gaming worked great even though it was the business OS.<p>Windows XP was really Windows 2000 for consumers. If you were already on 2000, it was a very minor improvement. Many power users stayed with 2000 for years. Since they were so similar, drivers and software was usually available for both. I only went to XP when I got a new computer.<p>However, if you were used to the 9x line, Windows XP was a total revolution. The NT based OSes were clearly head-and-shoulders above the 9x line. Between this improvement and 6+ years familiarity, Windows XP has become the gold standard Windows version in many people's minds.<p>XP was the last version of Windows I used. I've used Vista for a grand total of about 10 minutes, and maybe 30 on Windows 7. Since I no longer use a Windows machine at work, I just don't run into it. I've read that Vista really wasn't so bad, but the problem was it was too little substance <i>way too late</i>. Windows 7 is supposed to be quite nice.<p>I've been very interested in watching Windows 8. I don't think MS can afford another Windows Vista style rejection. There are very serious threats to their dominance. OS X continues to gain, the iPad has shows many people just how little they need a ""real"" computer, and many users do so much online that a Chromebook would probably cover them.<p>From where I sit, it looks like MS over-reached, pushing metro too hard on the desktop where it does't fit. If they pull out enough great apps by launch, they may be able to show the skeptics. Normal consumers (""Aunt Tillie"", if you will) may end up loving it.<p>It's also possible that this may be their OS X 10.0. It shows some promise and starts something, but isn't really ready. Maybe we'll get Windows 8.1 next year with some of the kinks worked out and it will sell like hotcakes.<p>Whatever happens, this is far more interesting to watch than going from Vista to 7 or Leopard to Snow Leopard.

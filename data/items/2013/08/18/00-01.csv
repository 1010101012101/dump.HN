If dealing pot shouldn&#x27;t be a crime, why should being prepared to defend yourself with a handgun while dealing pot be a crime?<p>I don&#x27;t understand the &quot;illegal&quot; qualifier.  Isn&#x27;t it always illegal to carry a handgun when dealing pot?  Isn&#x27;t having a handgun while committing a federal crime also a federal crime?<p>Obviously there are drug dealers who are aggressively violent, but if they haven&#x27;t been caught for being aggressively violent why should they be punished as if they were?  What other aspects of &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; should we do away with?<p>Even violent drug dealers represent a philosophical problem.  Practically I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m willing to support letting them out of prison, but rationally I have some sympathy for some of them.  Their involvement in the drug market shouldn&#x27;t be a crime, and the violence in that profession is almost always due to the fact that it&#x27;s a black market, with extremely high profit to be made and no legal protection against getting ripped off.<p>Their aggressive violence is not something to be condoned or accepted in society, but neither are laws that establish black markets that lead to such violence.  Drug criminalization advocates claim all sorts of reasons why they&#x27;re not at fault, from drug dealers being inherently evil due to bad parenting or genetics or whatever, to proximity to the criminal act and free will (no doubt legislators are further removed from the crime than the drug dealer who pulls the trigger).  But who&#x27;s really more at fault?  The socially marginalized drug dealer from a relatively poor background who probably had poor schooling, who gets caught up in drug dealing, and who kills someone because his drug organization needs him to?  Or a legislator with (supposedly) much more wisdom, who nevertheless votes to create a black market that leads to conditions where violence is commonplace?<p>I&#x27;m not condoning the violence.  I simply think the root cause is not the drugs or the guns, or even the drug dealers themselves.  Scapegoating gun-carrying drug dealers for the violence is just that... scapegoating.  I think it&#x27;s ultimately unproductive if we want to fix the problem.",1376786640

They&#x27;ll complain about it, but by and large they&#x27;re pretty supportive of the whole system. Which is important, because they&#x27;re responsible for some large fraction of the tax base, as well as a lot of corporate investment in the community.

As I read Andy Johnston&#x27;s letter, I gather that 1) Trip hung up on Andy. \n2) Andy thought this was rude.\n3) Andy has a lot of friends in SF that use yelp.\n4) Andy is going to tell his friends &quot;how [Trip] treated [Andy] as well as [Andy&#x27;s] feelings about the people who run Sauce.&quot;<p>While this is unprofessional to say the least, I see no extortion or anything like it all as the wording states that this recourse is based on a past event and is not contingent on Trip&#x27;s future actions at all. Also it is everyone&#x27;s right to tell their friends if they think a place or a person sucks, that&#x27;s part of what friends are for. And Andy doesn&#x27;t say that he&#x27;s going to write a bad review or have his friends write a bad review, he just says that he&#x27;s going to tell his friends how Trip treated him. That doesn&#x27;t mean that his friends will necessarily write reviews for him and because of that there is no guarantee of harm in any way.<p>What&#x27;s most interesting to me about this whole situation (and the part that seems backwards) is the Trip&#x27;s way of dealing with this. So okay, a Groupon employee wrote an angry letter to a restaurant owner that was 100% unprofessional and was probably understood by the restaurant owner to be a threat of defamation by the Andy&#x27;s network of friends. Trip&#x27;s response? To publicly post the letters to Facebook along with the Andy&#x27;s name, cell phone number and other contact information so that everyone else that doesn&#x27;t like Andy&#x27;s immature letter can call him any time of the day to tell him how much of a jerk he is? It seems a bit much.<p>Trip&#x27;s response letter was well written and had good advice but I believe it should have ended there. By making this whole thing public, Trip is really acting no more mature than Andy was when he wrote the offending letter. Not to mention that it could open Trip up to legal liability as I believe California has laws regarding the publication of private facts (e.g. Andy&#x27;s cell phone number).

6230917,comment,6229782,6230225,6,0,bane,,,"I don&#x27;t live in NYC, but I&#x27;ve visited there many times. I remember as a kid in the 80s, during my first visit and driving through rough parts of the city thinking &quot;what a hell hole&quot;. Cars on fire in the middle of the street, graffiti covering everything, in the evenings dark shadowy areas had an immediate feel of danger.<p>Over the years I noticed a definite improvement in the city. Cars stopped being on fire for one. The Subway, while not exactly the nicest place, isn&#x27;t bathed in spray paint, etc.<p>The last few years I started doing week long business trips up there two or three times a year and the city seemed absolutely transformed. Parks were being used by families after dark, streets were generally clean, people were out and about strolling around, biking or exercising. It wasn&#x27;t Singapore clean, but the streets were generally cleaner, and you really had to get into hard areas to see graffiti. Bars on windows started coming down, and the city felt like it was opening up. I also noticed a huge police presence everywhere.<p>And people were generally friendlier. Most of that New York snarl was gone (both a positive and a negative).<p>On one trip I did some consulting work for the NYPD and got a chance to see some of the data the city collects and processes and uses to improve city services -- I believe this system was put in place by Bloomberg. To say it&#x27;s impressive is an understatement. Noise complaints are correlated to nearby construction and crime, NLP was being brought online to process 911 call transcripts to look for crime trends, recently released prisoners were being cross checked against recent crime reports for recitivism. I think they&#x27;re still on the edge of what&#x27;s possible with what they&#x27;re collecting, but it&#x27;s being put to immediate and long-term city planning use. It&#x27;s not quite what you see in the movies, but outside of the federal government, I&#x27;ve never seen anything at quite the scale and level of detail as what NYC collects.<p>I&#x27;ll have to say that I <i>do</i> skip the outer boroughs, because they&#x27;ve been particularly unattractive to visitors, but I think in recent years some of the major new development work is starting to make me think again about that. There&#x27;s lots of downsides to staying in an overpriced cramped hotel room in downtown Manhattan, such as finding a reasonably priced place to eat dinner without heading 20 minutes uptown or eat endless Chinese food. But staying across the river, closer to a residential area with good local eateries might be a better alternative in the future.",1376784525

We are looking for a person that can take our founder&#x27;s (my) architect role and help make the company succeed while I am out whoring/selling us as needed.  We build some awesome products, focused on mostly the e-commerce and big-data space.  Far more on really hard big-data than anything, but e-commerce interests us as a unique opportunity.<p>We have an amazing group of people in Florida.  Of which we have one person that could step into this role, frankly you would likely compete with them, but in a positive way.  But because we aren&#x27;t stupid, it seems logical to look at people smarter than ourselves.  If you have interest, we want to talk.  We aren&#x27;t funded, we are bootstrapped.  Which frankly means there is an opportunity that is usually unfounded.  We are looking at Angles over the next 6-9 months, but frankly want to see if we can make it without them.  Not because they are bad, but because we believe in our team and that our team should win above everyone, outside our clients.<p>If this sounds like something you might be remotely interested in. Send me an email.  Let&#x27;s chat.  Meet up if you are in Florida, or if you are that candidate, hell I&#x27;ll meet you about anywhere.<p>Our stack is mostly node.js, C++ and moving towards GO.  With of course, the normal front end work you&#x27;d expect.  Our consulting world seems to consist of mostly Microsoft and database scaling issues....  So much we can talk about.<p>I am the original founder, and no, I am not interested in those that aren&#x27;t bought into our plan.  You buy in or you aren&#x27;t part of the team, its not gray to me. At the same time, we really want people to speak up, tells us we suck, and why.

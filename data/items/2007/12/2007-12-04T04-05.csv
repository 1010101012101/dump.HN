85821,comment,85740,85804,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Reading people is what poker is all about, but tells (mannerisms) are overly emphasized to a large degree in the media. They really aren't much a of a factor once you move beyond total amateurs, though at the same time, a relatively large % of the players you run into at the WSOP main event are playing their first live tournament anymore.<p>Really, though, it's more about observing how your opponent plays (both long term and short) and putting him on a range of holdings.

405713,comment,405587,405640,0,0,jackowayed,,,"As a high school student, I can tell you that what kids (or at least I) REALLY don't have passion for is tedious, boring work and classes that are boring.<p>Some teachers give far more homework than is necessary to learn the material. I understand that not all learn as fast as I, but it really can get ridiculous and become a waste of time, which makes kids not just hate the homework but school in general. I like my calc class so much more this year because it's like many college classes--the homework is optional. I get A's on the tests w/o doing the homework, so why should I do homework?<p>Teachers need to make the material more interesting by applying it to the real world more. So many times in my calc class I've heard ""Why do I care about whether this series converges?"" and the like. Teachers need to come up with interesting ways to teach and show how it's actually used so that the students will care.<p>I like learning infinitely more when I'm building apps at home than at school, and it's not just because I like coding more than other stuff. I see it's use. The use of learning about lamdas is so that I can make x work so that this app will do what I want it to do.",1229893046

The possibility to crowdsource books has existed for thousands of years - all you'd need to do is make a group of people sit together in a room and try to collaboratively write such a book.<p>But it has never worked with that. And it will never work, because when too many people collaborate, they tend to stay safe. They don't do new things.<p>The only way to crowdsource is if you make several people work parallel on independent parts of the project, and then mix them together at the end. For example, you have 15 people who are working independently on the soundtrack for the movie, and then a panel of judges picks the best soundtrack. If you let people vote on the result, they won't choose the best, they will choose the most familiar.<p>Crowdsourcing can work, but you still need to specialize people within it, and then give them creative freedom free of criticism from others.",1229892428

405696,comment,405616,405616,0,0,ensignavenger,,,"XP is dying- it's ancient technology, Vista is far superior.  Of course, Ubuntu and OSX are both worthy competitors to MS, but Vista is rock solid in both terms of stability and security.<p>The only reason why Microsoft would rather sell Vista than XP on new computers is because the longer they sell XP, the longer they will have to support it.  The more updates, service packs, and the longer they have to make software that is backwards compatible with it, rather than focusing on new technologies in Vista/Windows 7.  They make as much money off a sale of XP as they do Vista, but XP costs more to maintain.<p>If Windows developers aren't writing code for Vista, it won't magically work on Windows 7, so if your software is XP only,  its time to find a new supplier!<p>In short, Windows Vista is the future of the Windows platform, and it is a very bright future!  As far as most people that I talk to that claim they don't like Vista, most of them can't seem to articulate why, or they just say ""That's what I've heard"".  The MS bashers have done a great job spreading anti-Vista propaganda, but few can articulate any real problems with the OS.<p>Long Live Microsoft!  (And Linux, and Apple)",1229892016

Performance is similar to C# but coding in it is faster in my experience and above all a lot nicer if you like functional programming. Because it runs on the .NET VM or Mono VM it has good multicore support unlike OCaml. Haskell is more powerful as a language, but also has it's weak aspects. The main thing F# is missing imo in comparison to Haskell is type classes. And of course the Haskell community.",1229890943

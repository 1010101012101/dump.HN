9752367,comment,9751666,9752122,0,0,nulltype,,,"I started a prototype of a guide like this.  I think it&#x27;s probably the best way to teach OpenGL.  Besides not messing with compilers and linkers (a huge advantage) you can have interactive demos right there in the guide, which is pretty cool.  As well as explanatory demos like <a href=""http://acko.net/files/fullfrontal/fullfrontal/webglmath/online.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acko.net/files/fullfrontal/fullfrontal/webglmath/onli...</a>  In addition, I think WebGL will raise exceptions on errors, unlike C OpenGL, which is really really nice when you&#x27;re trying to learn it.<p>One thing that I think is missing is having a code description of how things work.  If you can present shaders as for loops over the input vertices or pixels, it might be more clear than just a bunch of diagrams.  I had to write my own rasterizer in order to get a decent idea of how it worked.<p>Another that might be missing is the state possessed by OpenGL.  The linked guide calls it a state machine but there&#x27;s no state machine diagram or anything.  Just having a list of the most common OpenGL state and a way to print it all out might be nice.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of bugs (like not setting glViewport or having the wrong GL_RENDERBUFFER bound) that would probably be easier if I could see the current OpenGL state or even know that GL_RENDERBUFFER wasn&#x27;t changed by GL_FRAMEBUFFER.",1434865942

9752358,comment,9751230,9752233,0,0,mturmon,,,"I disagree completely.  There is a theory of finding practical codes, and that theory took decades to elucidate.<p>A practical code must be not just computationally tractable, but also, the channel capacity must be approached quickly as block length increases, and decoding must not blow up for large block lengths.  As you can read in Gallager&#x27;s thesis, this was not known for LDPCs back in 1960.<p>Even in the mid-90s, when the connection between LDPC&#x27;s and turbocodes became understood, it took more theoretical work to understand why some codes (those having short cycles) had poor performance -- because decoding them was fragile.  (See the excellent <a href=""http://sigpromu.org/sarah/SJohnsonLDPCintro.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sigpromu.org/sarah/SJohnsonLDPCintro.pdf</a>).<p>Similarly to the OP, there may be multiple ways to find designs, but some of the methods or the resulting designs may be clumsy or inefficient.<p>Incidentally, it turns out there is a deep connection between coding (i.e., the present analogy) and designs (the OP), see <a href=""http://www.ces.clemson.edu/~keyj/psfiles/booktoc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ces.clemson.edu/~keyj/psfiles/booktoc.html</a>, and the follow-up article <a href=""http://www.ces.clemson.edu/~keyj/Key/dccupdateb.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ces.clemson.edu/~keyj/Key/dccupdateb.pdf</a>, especially chapter 7.",1434865819

But, some of my best memories from school are sitting with my OS and later RTOS partner, who was from China and spoke pretty poor English, and working through our issues into the middle of the night and beyond. And these past few weeks, I&#x27;ve spent hours every day with a very extroverted coworker getting our code just right (it&#x27;s still not done).

The stack of resumes you need to read through in order to start scheduling interviews has just gotten longer. The easier you make it to apply for jobs, the slower the hiring process becomes.<p>The above explanation of why it now takes employers
longer to fill open jobs isn&#x27;t convincing. Perhaps it
would make sense if you received:<p>(a) 10,000 resumes for a single opening (but that
doesn&#x27;t happen)<p>(b) 50 resumes from 50 different Nobel laureates and
you were torn trying to decide which one is best
(but that doesn&#x27;t happen either)<p>My experience is that if you got 5 resumes pre-Internet,
you&#x27;d get 50 post-Internet. But the additional screening
is negligible. I found that I can immediately reject 45
of the 50 resumes after looking at them for a minute
each because so many of the resumes are unqualified.<p>You might say that that is 45 minutes lost, but
even a single interview will take longer than that.
It&#x27;s insignificant to the overall hiring process.<p>Maybe what really happens is that in large HR-driven
companies, the HR department forces the hiring manager
to interview many more incompetent or unqualified people
because they got so many resumes to choose from.",1434864013

At my current place, we could fire half the staff and the company wouldn&#x27;t miss a beat. Sadly, there is no management, leadership or clear direction. We are self managed and so it&#x27;s very easy to spot the handful of proactive staff because they usually end up picking up all the tasks which eventually causes burnouts and reduced motivation etc...
I&#x27;ve tried to motivate my team mates but how do you motivate someone who&#x27;s comfortable and secure in their 9-5 and don&#x27;t really care to achieve any more than mediocre?

However, it still happens.<p>An example of &quot;innocent intermittence&quot; recently came up at my current employer: there was a test that invoked a web service twice, verifying idempotence.  It then asserted the responses were identical.  This worked almost all of the time, but when the two service invocations straddled a minute boundary, then some output text that included a rendered timestamp (rounded to the minute), which would cause the test to fail.<p>It&#x27;s extremely hard to get an engineering organization to just inherently know not to call, say, datetime.now() in their code, especially when the tests pass most of the time.",1434863054

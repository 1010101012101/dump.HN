I can also highlight a word and look it up or see a mention of a book and quickly check it out on a website, so there's no loss of interactivity for me.  I much prefer WeatherBug to websites because of response time.  Maps is also indispensable, and I think more reliable than a Web App would be.  Now Playing also has a superior interface.  It's basically a mashup of a Google Maps search for nearby theaters with Rotten Tomatoes ratings.  Netflix is indispensable, of course.<p>As for Web apps I use instead of local apps: FlightStats, Google Voice, and Google Reader.  Google Voice is only available as a Web App and isn't really a content app, but the other two I've chosen because I think they have a <i>superior interface</i> compared with the other options I tried.<p>Most of the rest of the apps I use frequently are utilities, toys and games.<p>These facts about my App use corroborate Fred's observations.  <i>It's about the UX!</i>  However you can achieve a superior UX, do it, but remember that you must beat the web.  This is harder to do on the more comfortable screen of the iPad.  On the iPhone, it's easy, because the screen is cramped.<p>The biggest threats to Apple right now are HTML5 and NaCl.  If those are widely accepted, then multitouch tablets will quickly become commodity, just as PCs became a commodity platform to run Windows on.",1275231017

You're looking for the networking potential of going back to school, and you want to start a start-up. In a technical master's program, you'll be around exactly the sort of people you need to meet for this to happen. In an MBA program, you'd network with a bunch of other business guys, many of whom wouldn't be interested in start-ups at all.<p>You'll obviously also gain a lot of truly valuable technical skills. You might not be able to single-handedly carry the technical side of a start-up by the end, but you'll definitely be able to make meaningful contributions and decisions about the technology.  This helps your future partners as well, since they know you can contribute to the tech while working the business side.<p>If you're worried about missing out on the education side of the MBA, don't be. I think you could get a better version of an MBA education by just buying a pile of books [1] and starting a company. You'll learn everything you need about business along the way.

I see almost everything from the people I'm truly close with, while occasionally dipping into the greater stream from of other acquaintances.  While facebook could do some better outreach on some of this stuff (my Dad was overjoyed to find out last week you can block applications -- no more farmville in the news feed), we on HN should be able to use it properly.  There's plenty of reasons to complain about fb, but cheapening friendship is not one of them..  it is completely about how you use the tool.<p>Also - (at least among my general circle - mid 20's, Australia, almost completely non-tech)  - Serious personal conversation is now almost predominately facebook.  Almost every party (excluding weddings/engagements) is a FB event (with maybe SMS invites).  IM = Facebook chat.  And email = Facebook PM.",1275228671

9534820,comment,9533678,9533678,0,0,sparkzilla,,,"This article has several very important points that any creator should keep in mind 1) The medium is the message. In other words the medium determines the art. In his case, the higher-resolution of phone screens determines that his message must change to take advantage of the screen&#x27;s capabilities. For example, when TV started it used radio and play formats for presentation. It wasn&#x27;t until years later, that people began to explore the visual storytelling aspects of the media. It takes a while for people to discover how each medium should be used most effectively. 2) The meaning of a communication is the response you get [1]. When your audience is saying that your game is retro and old-fashioned, they are not lying -- that&#x27;s what it means to them. You can try an educate them, but you are going against their understanding of point 1, or you can work to their expectations. Good luck to the guy, he really gets it.<p>[1]<a href=""http://coachingleaders.emotional-climate.com/nlp-presuppositions-8-the-meaning-of-communication-is-the-response-you-get/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coachingleaders.emotional-climate.com/nlp-presupposit...</a>",1431464358

I think it would have made the analysis better to have also ranked the dollar value of tax revenue per dwelling unit, and you would see they are paying an extremely high share under that metric. But then the title of the article would have to be &quot;Why Billionaires Pay the Most Per Capita Property Taxes in New York&quot;.<p>Another way to look at it, is if the tax rate were 1.7% instead of 0.017% then the building could not have been built. If the rate were 0.17% the sales price would have been closer to $10 million than $100 million. I think there is no scenario where the city gets the tower, the condo sells for $100 million, AND the city takes even .17% each year in property taxes.<p>The article reads like the city paid to build the tower and is giving the units away rent-free.

And buyers are paying only a fraction of that fraction in property taxes.&quot;<p>This is true in every state that I have lived in.  The tax-assessed value is lower than the market value, and the tax rate is a small portion of the tax-assessed value.<p>The tax-assessed value is lower because the assessors use a historical comparative market analysis, which looks to the past to determine a current price.  Free market buyers who assess the property for the purchase of making a purchase offer look at comparative historical values, but they also look to what the future market will be.  A rising market will command a higher price than a sinking  market.  The same is true of the stock markets.<p>This effect is especially true for unique locations or other outlier properties that can have grossly higher market values than tax-assessed values.  I am not surprised then that this is a problem in a place like Manhattan, New York.<p>Also, some states limit the annual increase of the tax-assessed value.  In California it is 1%.

I&#x27;ve got a cheap quad and it&#x27;s so light you can chuck it at someone as hard as you can and would only hurt them if it hit them in the eye.  When I&#x27;m flying it anywhere that has even a chance of other people being around, I use the prop guards on it (at the expense of weight/flight time) so nobody would get smacked by a spinning rotor if it somehow ended up near them.<p>For the most part, these little ones can probably hurt you as much as being hit with a rogue frisbee in the park.  No decapitations.  The bigger ones (Phantoms and the like) are more autonomous and better at avoiding crashes.  Still, it&#x27;s always a possibility and if you think you have any business flying one, you will know not to do so in a manner that makes it likely to hit anyone.<p>I think of it like riding a bike or a motorcycle.  When you ride a bike you are supposed to stay on the road but a lot of people (especially kids with smaller bikes) will sometimes ride on the sidewalk or through the park anyway.

The software supports a very rudimentary type of &quot;pressure sensitivity&quot; that (i think) is based on the capacitive area of the rubber tip. Maybe this can still be considered &quot;active?&quot; Perhaps. It is my understanding that the ability to determine the size of a touch (a radius?) is a system-wide thing that was added for iOS 8.<p>In practice, there is a huge difference between a true pressure sensitive stylus, i.e. a wacom stylus, with, say 1024 real levels of sensitivity, versus this more kludgy solution. The Wacom solution is far closer to real media performance. Paper, when used with Pencil seems to support 2 size variables. The first (mentioned above) is based on the new iOS 8 size of the rubber tip deal. The second size variant is based on the velocity that you use to draw your line. The faster you draw, the fatter the line gets. Amusingly, this is somewhat backwards of the way a real artist would use a brush loaded with, say, India ink (like an inker would use). In that scenario, the faster you move your brush, the thinner your line is (generally -- artists can vary this greatly with practice and technique)<p>Anyway, this Paper and Pencil deal has vastly improved since the first version. The tracking, the connection to the Pencil -- all have improved dramatically. Highly recommended for iPad artists and non-artists.<p>One thing to note is that a newer iPad will be much better at tracking than an older one (obviously!).",1431463626

Being a broke college student I sold it to pay for school. After college I bought another TR-808 for 700 in 2003 and kept it for 2 years. I grew bored of the sound, and had taken a decent enough sample set of it to replace it for most uses. The second 808 I had I modded to extend the decay of the kick drum to the point of self oscillation. I also bought a new row of buttons for it. Lastly I added a midi-DIN sync box. I had considered adding a pitch pot on the kick drum but prices were rising to the point that I thought was an 808 bubble(a princely sum of 1600 dollars). Now I see tr-808s on ebay for 3000+ and kick myself.<p>For anyone interested, the TR-8 does a good job emulating the TR-808/909 for the most part. I find the 808 cymbal(and to a lesser degree the hi-hat) sound nowhere near as good as the original and far less adjustable. The snares don&#x27;t quite have the snap I hear in my 808 samples. It should be noted though that there was quite a bit of variation from unit to unit in the TR-808. My first 808 had a nice long 2-3 second kick decay, while the second one I owned was about .5 seconds(which is why I did the mod) the hi hat and cymbals are a slightly different pitch as well.<p>I bought the 7x7-TR8 expansion and while somewhat useful(I like the 707 snare) the 707/727 sounds rarely get any use. The expansion did include some new takes on the 909 kick, snare and non specific clap and snap sounds. I really like to play with the new snap sounds, as it is a cool noise generator effect. I haven&#x27;t seen any news around this, but it seems silly for them not to do a TR-606/DR-55 expansion pack for the TR-8. I would have bought that over the 7X7 expansion.<p>There is a TR-808 documentary coming out soon 808themovie.com that will have tons of artist interviews who made their name with the 808. This article did a decent job of naming music that really used an 808, as there was one a few months ago that suggested mostly 909 tracks or tracks that may have used 808 samples sporadically in them. I get a bit pedantic about that because to me, you aren&#x27;t using an 808 if you loaded a drum sampler with 808 sounds. Beastie Boys licensed to ill is a great example of an album made mostly with an 808(but synced up with a sequential circuits drumtraks and possibly a linndrum on one or 2 tracks) By the late 80s, most rap was made on sp-12/1200s and akai MPCs.",1431462923

For games though, even beyond the problem of the audience not getting the point, in the age of retina displays there are many technical roadblocks with getting the pixels to stay blocky and render the way you want.<p>If one was so inclined to stick with blocky pixel art, one could always render the bitmaps&#x27; pixels as filled vector rectangles and the target display would autoscale those rectangles without blurring them (unless they became subpixel-sized.)<p>But, I personally think a high resolution pixel art style in games is just going to confuse the consumer.  Box shots no longer sell a game, trailer videos do.  Are you going for high detail but low color count and 24fps animation?  That does seem like a strange choice when I write it like that.<p>Low resolution pixel art (320 pixels wide or tall) makes a statement, and I think the consumers get the &quot;retro&quot; style the developer is going for there.  But then why would an artist with a pencil and a budget ever want to restrict themselves like that?<p>I don&#x27;t know what Ubisoft did in recent Rayman titles, but it looks like 3D or 2D vector art.

For this reason, many prominent artists go unknown in their lifetime.  The masses are attracted to &quot;bad&quot; art like Thomas Kinkade (I use quotes because the art is not actually bad, just lacks the originality that art connoisseurs seek). I would actually argue that you will have to make a choice between being a popular artist and being good artist (there is some overlap though). And it may well be the case that you don&#x27;t have the luxury to make this choice.<p>For me personally, I think that good pixel art is timeless (emphasis on &quot;good&quot;). It gives an artist a limited canvas and forces them to be creative.  You can instantly deduce an artist&#x27;s skill based on how well they can convey a concept with a limited palette and resolution.  An unlimited palette and high resolution actually magnifies the flaws in art, IMO (leaves less to the imagination).  I find that in many modern 3D games, the suspension of disbelief is destroyed when I walk up to a character and see blurry textures and pointed polygonal edges.<p>For an idea of what good pixel art looks like (at least according to my opinion and many others), check out Henk Nieborg&#x27;s work:<p><a href=""http://www.henknieborg.nl/gallery_pixels.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.henknieborg.nl/gallery_pixels.html</a>",1431462272

Very often, the book&#x27;s prose would start sentences something along the lines of &quot;though the graphics were crude, etc etc etc.&quot;<p>These sorts of lines, constantly repeated, irked me, not because they weren&#x27;t technically true or anything, but because it&#x27;s such a &quot;looking-backward&quot; point of view. At the time, that&#x27;s not how people saw it. It was all about pushing forward the state of the art, and we miss something when we look back on it in that way.<p>I guess in a similar way I&#x27;ve had the same feeling about &quot;modern&quot; pixel art, where it often seems to miss the point. By treating it as just an art style, it turns it from an exercise in conveying a vision despite limitations, into an effort to simplify and downsample because those are the most easily-recognized surface-level hallmarks of that period.<p>For me, the magic of that era comes from seeing techniques like color cycling ( <a href=""http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/?sound=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/?sound=0</a> ), where the desire to get a certain effect led to interesting workarounds, rather than being satisfied with limitations because it&#x27;s &quot;retro.&quot;",1431461996

In it, he re-iterates the main points of his thesis, that there are some who go too far to drum up support (and I have some sympathy with this), and that because we don’t know everything, we actually know nothing (here, I beg to differ). He also gives us his estimate, ~0.8 C for the global warming that will occur over the next century and claims that, since models differ by 400% in their estimates, his guess is as good as theirs. This is not true.  (...)<p>> Finally, in an appendix, Crichton uses a rather curious train of logic to compare global warming to the 19th Century eugenics movement. He argues, that since eugenics was studied in prestigious universities and supported by charitable foundations, and now, so is global warming, they must somehow be related. Presumably, the author doesn’t actually believe that foundation-supported academic research ipso facto is evil and mis-guided, but that is an impression that is left.<p>Kind of makes me wonder how much I can trust Crichton on anything. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/michael-crichtons-state-of-confusion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/michae...</a>",1431461783

I think that there is also a huge amount of &quot;abuse&quot; in these rules, some of which are definitely universally applicable as applied to pixel art, IMO - namely, using the same pixel size, and perhaps keeping the palette reduced as far as reasonable.  There is quite a large amount of &quot;bad&quot; pixel art, probably more so than &quot;good&quot; pixel art, so it is easy to come to dislike the genre nowdays.

It&#x27;s really something to witness, and totally unexpected for those of us who grew up on desktop computers and laptops. FB is trying to turn messenger into a platform now in the U.S., and they have the whatsapp platform to fall back on or develop in other countries. Whatsapp could have become a threat to FB&#x27;s growth in developing markets by adopting wechat&#x27;s platform and timeline features, so the valuation was defensive. Time will tell if there is potential for messaging as a revenue generating platform outside of China/Asia.<p>The best counter-argument to the valuation is that Whatsapp had something like 20 engineers on staff when they were acquired. It&#x27;s hard to imagine a future where a global messaging platform doesn&#x27;t continue to need less employees to manage it.

You raise an interesting question about software patents.  
Many people think that physical hardware devices, like an improved portable GPS device for my car, or a police radar gun, should be patent eligible. Many of those same people think that an app that performs the same functions in a mobile device should not be patent eligible. It could be argued, however, that in these cases, the hardware and software are really implementations of the same &quot;invention.&quot;",1431461562

This is my MVP for running an Event. Here is how I hacked it:<p>WordPress for background info that I linked to from email invites.<p>Gmail Groups for email lists: only pain was manual copy and paste from LinkedIn but that was a one time chore. Next time I will probably use MailChimp (ForeverFree version) as Gmail Contacts/Groups is limited and a bit kludgy.<p>Eventbrite; it is free for free events\n(MeetUp was my presumption but monthly fees put me off). If I was charging I might switch to EventBee for their $1 flat fee.<p>Promote using LinkedIn and Twitter: automated via my WordPress post<p>Location and refreshments via a corporate sponsor.<p>It all worked and it was free. It was small but attendees said they wanted to come to the next one and gave me feedback on how to improve it. So it served the classic MVP purpose of being a learning process.<p>For my next event, I plan to try a few things such as:<p>Record Using iPhone. Could I get a stand to hold it?<p>Broadcast the event live? Or record it and upload to YouTube?<p>Use Polling both before and after to get some quotable data points",1375034203

I don&#x27;t believe the acceleration is cataclysmic for the occupants (although probably jolting).

It&#x27;s implicit in Alexander&#x27;s suggestion that either (a) the total length of the loop is an integer multiple of the wavelength of the waves, so they are &quot;resonant&quot; in that sense, or (b) the envelope of the wave is much less than the length of the loop.

I&#x27;ve forgotten a lot of the details but I&#x27;ll throw out o few seat of the pants thoughts on this.<p>In no particular order (and not specifically related to modern languages):<p><pre><code>  The option for compilation would be very interesting.\n\n  Within a function, variables are global by default.  Huge pain in the ass.\n\n  Objects.\n\n  A language-defined interface to C (or some other suitable language) for \n  when you need to speed things up.\n\n  An extension to nested arrays that allows you to create C-like structures.\n  I am going after the self-documenting nature of having structure members \n  have name-based access.\n\n  An extension to function definition to allow for more than two arguments. \n  This would require a little language re-thinking.\n\n  I would also look into making a hybrid that includes some C-like syntax\n  with an APL core.  C/C++ -like comments and conditionals with bracketed\n  groupings of APL code would go far in making code easier to read and \n  organize.\n\n  Native C-like switch() primitive with APL-inspired extensions.  For example,\n  switch could take a vector argument.\n\n  APL-run-time-definable comparison operator.  Sometimes I want to apply a complex\n  evaluation function to data rather than the simple equal, not equal, grater/less\n  than, etc. operators.\n\n  The ability to enforce data types if desired.\n\n  A means of telling the compiler/interpreter to optimize code \n  --at the statement level-- for speed or resource (memory footprint) and \n  other criteria.  Certain operations can explode into huge multidimensional\n  arrays which isn&#x27;t always the best idea.\n\n  Real-time extensions integrated into the language.\n\n  Ability to use GPU resources for computation.\n\n  Standard interface for custom hardware-based acceleration (read: custom \n  FPGA boards).  \n\n  True binary vectors and arrays.\n\n  More flexibility in multidimensional array indexing.\n\n  A rethinking of the workspace model to better support multi-developer \n  environments.\n\n  Genetic and Evolutionary computing primitives built into the language.\n\n  Built in primitives for multi-threaded/multitasked computing.\n\n  Built in primitives for network access and processing.\n\n  Built in primitives for multi-core and distributed computing.\n\n  Built-in primitives for data exchange.  For example, ingest or output \n  nested array data from/to JSON, SQL, XML or other modern data formats.\n\n  Better pattern-matching primitives.  I&#x27;m thinking at least regular \n  expressions. \n\n  A general cleanup of the notation to remove lame text-based &quot;fixes&quot; \n  from an era when rendering non-ascii characters required custom ROMs \n  on the graphics card.  All APL notation should be symbolic.  ASCII \n  should be limited to strings, function, variable, object and other \n  constructs that require text.\n\n  Make it open source and make the open source version far superior to \n  any available commercial version.\n\n</code></pre>\nLike I said, I&#x27;ve been away from APL for a while.  I am sure there are a lot more important enhancements I could suggest if I spent a year seriously getting back into the game.  Today I have very little use for APL outside of using it as an advanced calculator of sorts, mostly when I do hardware design.  Even then, sometimes it is more convenient to use \nExcel for that purpose because of the value in being able to communicate with others.",1375033241

You have to design your system presuming that someone has hacked your server - if the encryption key is stored there, they can find it.<p>- As you&#x27;re aware, password hashes are a way to avoid storing sensitive data (though they should still be treated as sensitive). You&#x27;re using a strong hash function and a salt, right?<p>- Re-use the principle of password hashes for API keys to simply <i>avoid</i> having to store hyper-sensitive data: generate a long (say 512-bit) secure random number (using OpenSSL) as the user&#x27;s secret API key. Then hash the key as if it were a password and store only the hash. Now if someone steals your API key database they can&#x27;t use it to authenticate as your users.<p>Note: for API keys a strong hash such as bcrypt will probably be too slow and resource-intensive. However, because API keys are (long) random data, unlike passwords, you can use a faster hash function like SHA-1.<p>- As for credit card data: don&#x27;t. You probably can&#x27;t afford the PCI audits and dedicated hardware and the same principle applies: just don&#x27;t store sensitive data. Instead, many payment gateways offer &#x27;tokens&#x27; for recurring payments in which you pass the payment information to their API without storing it (or use their hosted page in iframe, if acceptable to you) and they return a token which can be used to charge against that card in the future. Not all payment gateways offer this, and some charge (too much) so take a look at <a href=""https://spreedly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spreedly.com/</a> which offers a middle-man gateway service which adds tokens and other API feature to pretty much all of the payment gateways.<p>As you can see, in both cases it&#x27;s possible to simply avoid storing the most sensitive data.",1375032491

If there was any justification for that price of 88+ mil, that would be it. Looks like that went right out the damn window. All systems have bugs, I think we can all agree on that, but I&#x27;d like to know that they followed the most sensical procedure to rolling this out. Did they test it prior to release? How did they test it. Did they bother with unit tests at the lowest level? Did they perform thorough integration tests? Did they consider rolling out incrementally (if possible) the new system so that they wouldn&#x27;t be completely left out in the rain when it failed? What contingency plans if any did they build into the system upon failure?

We as a society (thankfully!) don&#x27;t do that, so we end up paying for it anyway when a poor person goes into the ER. Given the baseline that you don&#x27;t let people die who can be saved, it&#x27;s a short jump to a collective action problem, especially given the wildly varying income inequality and the fact that health care is demand inelastic and price insensitive (you&#x27;ll pay any amount of money to not die, and for the foreseeable future people will always get sick/injured). I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s better to internalize those costs - Insured people are cheaper overall, so everyone gets insurance and it gets subsidized by everyone, with transparent-ish rates, than externalize them (the hospital has to cover the un-negotiated costs of a poor cancer patient, so tylenol is now $17/pill)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem</a>",1375031651

There&#x27;s no follow-through or followup. This is why people have been desensitized to the standard-issue apology as detailed in this article. They&#x27;re used to seeing boilerplate and empty promises, but the devil is in the details. Listing a concrete action taken is a great way to go, but sometimes you don&#x27;t have time to take such action (or fully consider the ramifications) before the apology needs to be issued.<p>In summary: 1) take serious stock of the issue ASAP, 2) state sincere apology demonstrating accountability for the fuckup and responsibility for the fix, 3) maintain communication as fixes are implemented, and detail them.",1375031544

That means anything that can overcome one orange tree can overcome them all.  Shuffling genes around will just delay the next killer.  It will be interesting to see if they can come up with a way to cause sexual reproduction to happen again.  The resulting genetic diversity will make oranges less of a target.<p>Somewhat related is how they and much other modern agriculture is done - huge fields of exactly the same species only - a monoculture.  This too makes it easy for invaders.  The fix of multiple species being grown together is often shown to work, but makes the farming and harvesting considerably more complicated and expensive.<p>Recommended reading is Michael Pollan whose books and articles about food are great <a href=""http://michaelpollan.com/articles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelpollan.com/articles/</a>",1375031180

I was flabbergasted by the slow pace at which things moved, and that I had to create accounts in 3 separate systems to submit and get paid for even very basic invoices.<p>Government is a place that is ripe for disruption, but the walls around it are so high, I don&#x27;t know how to really breach them. There is a huge machine in place of contractors and lobbyists which essentially maintain a strict control over all IT contracts that come out of the public sector. Massive corporate entities with an entrenched web of influencers at every level of government, ensuring that only a select few even have an opportunity to realistically compete for the jobs. The amount of overspending that could be eliminated with the disruption of those entities probably represents a significant portion of local, state, and national budgets, not to mention the likely better solutions that could be presented by folks more accustomed to working efficiently.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily saying the 20 somethings who were going to make &quot;Snapchat for dogs&quot; could do a better job as government contractors. But certainly someone who designed infrastructure for Twitter might have some interesting perspective on how to manage 911 traffic.",1375031157

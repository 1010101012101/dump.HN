That in turn panics more of the shorts, which inspires more buying, which raises the price more, which inspires more buying...<p>Remember, when only 5% of a company is publicly traded, the price of the stock has a lot more to do with its traders than the company.

One of the first discussions we had was on the quality of the skills most students graduate with.<p>The course needs some serious redevelopment and a refocused vision to stay viable in our ever changing web environment.<p>Problems I've come across from interviews with various students (pre and post graduate level) include:<p>* Not a strong enough focus on core technologies<p>* Outdated set of technologies being taught (curriculum is 10 years old)<p>* Students' portfolios look anything but impressive<p>* Students are not encouraged to build businesses or working prototypes - merely to 'get a job' (I feel this is a waste of their free time in the 3-4 years they spend on campus)<p>* Not enough focus on emerging technologies<p>* No focus on mobile web development at all<p>* Too much focus on M$ and Oracle technologies (although this is still heavily required in the country)<p>On the positive side, the course is up for review on a curriculum level. I though this would be the best platform and crowd to ask for suggestions and help.<p>I'd appreciate any and all discussion on this topic as I really want students who invest their time and effort to step into industry (ideally on their own) with a solid and grounded footing.<p>Below are the course majors.<p>INTERNET PROGRAMMING I
Students acquire an understanding of the core principles of Java and they learn how to produce
well-designed, effective applications using some of the more advanced features of the language.<p>INTERNET PROGRAMMING II

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the various database concepts, the design, implementation and management of a database system, as well as Standard Query Language and the practical application of SQL. The SQL principles will be applied practically in the use of the Oracle SQL courseware and software. The qualifying learner should have a broad understanding of the environment within which the software component of a computer-based system is developed; to enable them, for example, to liaise between end users and system designers/programmers; to recommend particular software packages and to write and modify programmes. The qualifying learner should be able to explain and apply database concepts and approaches to database
design. The practical part includes programming with MySQL as a database management system (DBMS).
(Total tuition time:  90 hours)<p>What would you add to the course? 
Would you change the focus?
Would more project based teams be ideal for technology deployment?
How can one ensure a more entrepreneurial element in the course (especially at first year level) ?<p>Thanks.",1322232557

Each of Cassini's three RTGs contains 72 marshmallow-sized pellets of plutonium, each weighing about 150 grams, and each separately enclosed in iridium inside a shock-proof graphite impact shell. Four of each of these are enclosed within one of 18 separate General Purpose Heat Shell modules, each with its own separate heat shield and impact shell. Should any kind of crash or problem happen, including breaking up during a re-entry, these impact shells separate from each other and scatter.<p>Conversely, in order to detonate Pu-238, you need a single critical mass of solid plutonium weighing at least 10 kg. This critical mass has to be imploded with a simultaneous explosion from all sides, applying sudden pressure precisely from all angles at the same exact instant. Obviously this couldn't happen with an RTG design. Although each RTG does theoretically have enough plutonium to make up a critical mass, there isn't any way that it could all be brought together into the right shape.

Python is also about a zillion times easier to hack quickly.""<p>What a totally pointless exercise, if anything he should have spent the time to make the build process <i>less</i> dependent on other packages, not more.<p>Same with javas 'ant', why on earth does everybody and their brother feel the need to reinvent the wheel.<p>If you're going to roll out some package try to keep your dependencies to the absolute minimum.",1234789148

You should have a couple of sentences explaining it.<p>I also don't like the UI, you have 3 areas for navigation (left, right, top)... do you need that? You need to think about the site from your users perspective, a lot of the links are obvious to you because you made the site but won't be obvious to the user. You need to work through some use cases.<p>Also, those register and login buttons make your site look unprofessional. There's nothing wrong with just having text links.",1234788304

If different people keep doing this (DDoS effectively) this could be kept up for a while.

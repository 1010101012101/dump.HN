But otherwise, this whole idea of squirreling away money little bit by little bit as you find customers and solve their mundane IT problems, whilst not taking an interest in the ""pointless meetups & language-centric threads""...is like, I dunno, computing the Riemann integral of some exponential function by taking tiny narrow slices and systematically adding them up one by one. While the procedure is very sound & society will commend you for being this patient, upright, model citizen, you are never going to ever compute that integral this way...life is just too short & there will always be 20 year old Zucks around who will plug the upper & lower bounds into a closed form formula & spit out the answer you were chasing for your entire life.

I've worked at some pretty big corporations and now I'm looking to buy a house while my friends are just getting out of University with junior developer positions while living at home. My co-workers are all around 10-20 years older than I am. I've made senior developer, but I won't be able to move into any type of management positions for another 5-10 years just because of my age.

4729903,comment,4726876,4729400,3,0,gregsq,,,"Well, keeping to this example, there are sometimes conflicting requirements. A transient with a long train decay, such as a crash cymbal or knock, explosion or gunfire for example requires a wide view to properly observe the full affect. The trailing decay can last for quite a while in this scenario. The optimum situation here is to include a segment before and afterwards, or perhaps even more than that, depending, as some modulation becomes clearer the more you zoom out, not in.<p>At the same time, operating on selected segments is more efficiently done with finely controlled hairline cursors, where an obscuring object like a finger doesn't contend, generally. After this of course, zooming and other means of fine control and selection come into play.<p>In scenarios like this it is very much a case of not being able to see the forest for the trees if making a representation too large.<p>There are solutions to the problem of precise location, which I think include touch and gestures, though not necessarily solely through touch. In practice I use the right hand for precise hairline location and the left to zoom in with gestures, zoom out again for context and then iterate.<p>I'm not arguing for mice over touch. I'm looking at precision. I always find it quicker to type on my Bluetooth keyboard than on my iPhones screen keyboard. The reason for that for me has just to do with the ratio between active elements. Keyboard keys are larger than my fingers, on screen keys are smaller.<p>I actually think that in some cases gestures in the z plane, as well as x and y would be a way of adding capability.<p>These opinions are based on having to give up the USB mouse in the field, using JTAG's and external drives in a two port only MBP.

4729877,comment,4729068,4729686,10,0,iandanforth,,,"Language is a set of behaviors\nBehavior for humans and other animals requires a brain and body (almost always)\nThe organisation, growth, and function of the brain and body are influenced by genetics.<p>So we can say first and formost that language <i>is</i> influenced by genetics. Having a tongue, vocal chords, hands, ears. These all help to acquire language.<p>So now the question is to what degree does genetics influence language and language acquisition?<p>Is it fully governed by genetics? We know that removing a child from the company of others during development eliminates complex language and severely stunts their ability to acquire language. So, in a single individual, language has never been observed to arise spontaneously and the facility to acquire language is something you can lose.<p>If you damage certain portions of the brain aspects of language can be removed. See Fluent Aphasia for a particularly odd example. However, these aphasias are known to remit and studies show that other portions of the brain have taken over from the damaged portion. So we know that the capacity for language is not entirely localized to a genetically determined location.<p>We also know there was a time when there wasn't language and now there is, so at least once in human history language <i>did</i> arise spontaneously. The article you mention is evidence that language can evolve spontaneously in <i>groups</i> of humans. In fact there is evidence that the rudiments of language arise in groups of many animal species including apes, whales, and dolphins. Many animals communicate, but with insufficient sophistication as to be described as a language.<p>So it is safe to say that there are genetic factors in producing communicative behavior. Sounds, postures, marking etc. I feel it is also safe to say that there are genetic factors that predispose groups of some species to develop more complex systems of communication (but these are not limited to humans) and that groups of humans are particularly good at complex communication.<p>Unfortunately for Chomsky there is little to no evidence that any one type of language is more likely than another. Grammars, phonemes, words, abstract concepts ... all of these have huge between language variation. The similarities between languages are well explained by either physical characteristics of speech production or regularities in the environment of the languages origin.<p>So yes, language is both learned, and cultural, even if it isn't purely so.",1351806007

FFS2 is capable of much larger file systems, though other limits will be reached long before the file system limits will be reached.\nThe boot/installation kernels only support FFS, not FFS2, so key system partitions (/, /usr, /var, /tmp) should not be FFS2, or severe maintenance problems can arise (there should be no reason for those partitions to be that large, anyway). For this reason, very large partitions should only be used for ""non-system"" partitions, for example, /home, /var/www/, /bigarray, etc.<p>Note that not all controllers and drivers support large disks. For example, ami(4) has a limit of 2TB per logical volume. Always be aware of what was available when a controler or interface was manufactured, and don't just rely on ""the connectors fit"".<p><i>Larger than 2TB disks</i><p>The MBR system used on PCs only directly understands disks up to 2TB in size. fdisk(8) will typically report a disk size of the real size modulo 2TB, so your 2.7TB disk (sold as 3TB) will show as around 700GB in fdisk(8). This does not in any way hinder OpenBSD's ability to utilize larger disks, as the MBR is used only to bootstrap the OS, once the OS is running, the file systems are defined by the disklabel, which does not have a 2TB limit.<p>To use a larger than 2TB disk, create an OpenBSD partition on the disk using fdisk, whatever size fdisk will let you. When you label the disk with disklabel(8), use the ""b"" option to set the OpenBSD boundaries (which defaulted to the size of the OpenBSD fdisk partition) to cover the entire disk. Now you can create your partitions as you wish. You must still respect the abilities of your BIOS, which will have the limitation of only understanding fdisk partitions, so your 'a' partition should be entirely within the fdisk-managed part of the disk, in addition to any BIOS limitations.<p>---------------------------------------------<p>ZFS on FreeBSD was just a bit easier (for me) for our Samba PDC.  Otherwise, I use OpenBSD.",1351805844

According to Wikipedia lithium reserves are 13 million tonnes [1], but of course their 39 million could be due to a different interpretation of ""reserve"". I based my calculation on a Chevy Volt, which uses 1.4kg lithium per kwh for a total of 60kg per 40kwh, perhaps other cars are more efficient in their lithium use.<p>If we use those figures, 39 million tonnes / 1 billion cars comes down to 39kg per car; not too far off. According to this [2], there were around 60 million cars produced in 2011. Conservatively assuming that that grows to 100 million in 2025, that's 50 million electric cars per year according to Musks prediction. At 39kg per car that is around 2 million tonnes of lithium per year. Not too far off my 2.5 million tonnes. So my point still stands that we have to increase lithium production around 70x just for cars (and consider trucks, cargo ships, motorcycles, farming vehicles etc). Perhaps we will be able to do that without increasing prices significantly, perhaps not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.worldometers.info/cars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldometers.info/cars/</a>",1351805814

I do know that the heating element in a dryer is usually <i>rated</i> for 5000 watts+, but you have to keep in mind that it doesn't run at a 100% duty cycle, even on high heat.  (I can't find anything that talks about what the typical duty cycle on high heat is, so maybe I'll measure mine the next time I dry something.)  I'm pretty sure it would more or less nuke your clothes if the dryer dissipated over 5000 watts all the time.<p>Point being, if an EV charger really does draw 40 amps at 220 volts, that is about twice the real power consumption of a clothes dryer.  This is a non-trivial amount of juice.  It would be a <i>massive</i> problem if half the automobile-owning households in the US started charging their cars all night long at those rates.<p>It's not just a matter of you not personally having any use for swappable batteries.

Chomsky essentially founded the field of formal language theory, and was the first to propose many widely-used constructs, such as the context-free grammar. They may or may not explain how English works, but pretty much everything on the Chomsky hierarchy has been put to productive use in computers.<p>In a much more general sense, his arguments against blank-slate learning are pretty mainstream in machine learning as well. Chomsky's specific approaches aren't too widely used (though there is some work on grammar induction), but the idea that inductive bias is key to machine learning is widespread, though perhaps in a weaker sense than the very specific and strong inductive bias Chomsky proposes for language learning.",1351804794

I think you skimmed it, concluded that I was arguing for abolition of all price caps to allow ""free market capitalism"" to solve all our problems, and wrote a philosophical response.<p>In fact, I don't believe we should abolish all price caps. I simply think the cap we've chosen is foolishly low. We have empirical evidence that a dense western urban area can survive on prices >300% higher than what they are in NYC now, and yet we've capped price increases at 10%. Fixing prices on a good whose intrinsic value is rapidly increasing, as gasoline's value clearly is in NYC, amounts to declaring a state-managed fire sale on gasoline. How can that possibly be a sensible response to a crisis of scarcity?<p>If you want to think about it from the other direction: price fluctuations in the gas market of 10% or more are not altogether uncommon, and empirically they do little to alter people's behavior. The 10% cap therefore amounts to a declaration that the market will not be allowed to alter people's behavior, despite the obvious fact that people are not behaving optimally --- and you can look at any gas station near NYC to verify that.<p>Finally, I just think you made a very flimsy argument upthread: that ""jacking up prices"", as you put it, serves no objective purpose. Well, no. Not true. At all. The knowledge that rising prices aren't an intrinsically bad thing will help in all sorts of situations where we have actual judgements to make in our lives.",1351804777

Spend as much time as you can doing what you have a drive to do. (e.g: setting yourself to be financially above or where you were when you grew up, trying to start a band, or trying to create the next major startup). \n   c. Make sure to live below your means. (i.e: Ensure if you make 100 dollars after tax regardless of pay 25 of it is being saved. This gets harder and harder as there is a asymptote decided by the market (cost of living) and situation (whether or not your parents basement is available) you live in).<p>2) Children: There is a lot of qualifications here that were taken in place in the article. While the clock is ticking and I agree, people look at children as a chore taken to ensure a certain lifestyle later in life; or just want them and are willing to sacrifice whatever else to enjoy having children. Both are generally the case but I feel the set of things that people choose to give up is too large. You should ensure that your finances should be in place to support them but the amount in which you should support them should vary based off of your financial situation (by this I do not limit it to the children's wants (less toys) but rather also the child's needs (why pay for a private school if you can't afford it? because it's worth the difference in learning experiences? What about no private school and finding other means of educating the child?))<p>3) Brain Finishes Forming: Fight it if you think that this is going to be the case (and care; I know a very large set of people who enjoy being close minded. It means that their life is less complicated by relatively asinine decision making, when they would prefer the action portion of the work (I can't understand this but have debated it with individuals)).",1351804496

Arguing as if the high prices are an ongoing problem for the poor or the rich doesn't make sense.

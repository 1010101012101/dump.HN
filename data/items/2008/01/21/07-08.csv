I'm pretty sure they haven't dropped that for UE3, and language-wise that's apparently somewhat like Java. Historically, Unreal games have had most of their logic written in UnrealScript.<p>And yeah, 500000 really isn't much in gamedev. I worked as an engine programmer for the year following graduation and worked on a almost-2-million-LOC behemoth (including tools, so the game was probably nearer 1-1.5m) which wasn't an MMO or even had that much data to look after at run time. (the Wii only has 88MB of RAM)<p>I can echo the long compile and linking times mentioned elsewhere. Almost none of the code used templates, which would have been an obvious candidate for driving up the compile time. Linking really isn't fast anymore either once you hit a couple hundred compilation units.<p>Of course, the code was a complete mess. Few people cared much about the quality of the code base, particularly as the game was released about 9 months late and everyone just wanted it out the door. (it was delayed mostly by management pushing for features rather than having bugs fixed for the 2/3 of development and large-scale changes imposed by the publisher late in development) Not a particularly pleasant experience, but boy did I get to practice my skills in understanding and debugging badly written, undocumented code. Typically code that nobody who still worked at the company had ever touched or seen. Or maybe that was the crazy overtime talking.<p>~phil",1200902323

Even the desktop stuff I am doing either has a web component, communicates with the web or a website in some way or has a version that is a website.  Learn your Javascript and have a decent working knowledge of HTML and CSS.<p>I do think that you should know probably PHP (for consulting most web projects are in this or are extensions of projects written in it) and one of either Ruby or Python.<p>There are opportunities out there, just not nearly as many.  Also keep in mind as a recent graduate you are competing with all the people who never made the web transition because they already had 3-5 years experience on the desktop that now have 10-12 years experience there.",1200901349

101469,comment,100732,100831,0,0,skmurphy,,,"you're right, what I should have written is the question in their mind is ""how soon and for how much can we create liquidity"" with more of a focus on how much than how soon. In other words, how will the funds be used to reduce the risk in the startup. If acquisition is your likely exit (and that's a   safe bet for most new startups) then they may ask you to speculate who would buy the firm and for how much. I am not advocating a ""built to flip"" strategy"" as much as trying to understand an investor perspective.",1200898812

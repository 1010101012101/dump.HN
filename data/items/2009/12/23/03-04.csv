As someone who had never heard of it before, I was left with a choice of reading the rest of the post and hopng to find out or navigating away from it to explore the site. A short description would have helped those unfamiliar with your service and wouldn't have offended those that are.<p>One other thing: For a site about style, the site is not very stylish itself. I think for your site, a designer or a few CSS books (SitePoint has some good ones) would be a good investment.<p>Again, thanks for the writeup. Looks like it has a lot of growth potential.<p>Edit: maybe it didn't render properly on my iPhone on the first visit. Upon checking it again, I can see the design.

I'm not a security expert, but isn't brute force impractical except in the smallest of search spaces?<p><i>there's nothing stopping you from gaming Google's algorithm right now (and many spammers are doing just that)</i><p>True, but the situation would probably be even worse if the algorithm were open, wouldn't you say?<p><i>If you can't secure your code while being open about your methods, obscurity won't help in the long term.</i><p>Also true, but as other people have already commented, this is more like a matter of policy than security. And besides, some methods can be open because they're intrinsically hard to get around, (e.g. crypto algorithms: cos it's math, baby) and others because they're expensive (e.g. I don't know, hardware requiring expensive/rare materials?). However, web search algorithms are horses of another color, aren't they? I hesitate to say for certain, but it's possible that there is no search algorithm that cannot be gamed if it is known. If that is the case, then security by obscurity, while not being an ideal solution, may in fact be the <i>only</i> option.",1261540458

1011497,comment,1010639,1010639,0,0,thristian,,,"I'm somewhat confused by this article. It describes the problem like this:<p>> Those dragons are such: you have two paths inside sys.path that contain similar code. Such as I do with all of the Domain51 code. Package one has foo as a module while package two contains bar. The assumption would be that Python acts like most other languages and would exhaust it's sys.path trying to find both packages, but that's not the case. It'll get to the first one, then pretend the second doesn't exist.<p>...but I'm certain Python can ""import foo; import bar"" without issue.<p>Poking at the sample repository the article links to, it seems the problem is something more like this:<p><pre><code>    +- some_path/\n    |  |\n    |  +- foo/\n    |     |\n    |     +- __init__.py\n    |     +- fred.py\n    |\n    +- other_path/\n       |\n       +- foo/\n          |\n          +- __init__.py\n          +- barney.py\n</code></pre>\n...where both some_path/ and other_path/ are in $PYTHONPATH. If you have some\nPython code that does this:<p><pre><code>    from foo import fred\n    from foo import barney\n</code></pre>\n...then the second line will raise ImportError. The first line causes a\nmapping ""foo"" -> ""some_path/foo/"" to be added to the module name cache, so\non the second line it tries to import ""barney"" from ""some_path/foo/"" and\nfails.<p>I'm not sure what pkg_resources has to do with anything, but I think Stop\nDoing That is a reasonable response.",1261540315

1011477,comment,1010543,1011358,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Software is different because it's considered a creative work and therefore falls under the veil of copyright. Copyrights protect each implementation individually, and this is ample protection.<p>Patents generally cover a whole _invention_, not an implementation, and each implementation requires a license from the patent holder. So, in the case of the web browser, had Mosaic or Netscape patented this concept every competitor would be forced to obtain a license from the patent holder and open-source or free browsers would be impossible. Patents in the case of software therefore have a chilling effect and prevent significant competition for a long time.<p>Pharmaceuticals only get patented by publicly divulging their significant modes of operation; a software patent outlines only vague processes, like the i4i patent that's brought this whole thing up.<p>Software is also merely a high-level implementation of an algorithm. Algorithms are non-patentable and all math is discovered, not invented; this has been settled earlier, and is the reason that algorithms alone are not awarded patent protection. Software is no different.<p>In software, the implementation details are significant enough that patent protection is not only undesirable but in fact crippling to the industry as a whole. Take a look at some software patents; in fact, take a look at i4i's patent specifically. It's applicable to basically that edits XML documents, whether it be a word processor, an IDE, or anything else. These things are way too vague and they encroach on prior and future art in a hugely negative way.<p>See <a href=""http://w2.eff.org/patent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://w2.eff.org/patent</a> for a list of some rather absurd software patents granted by the USPTO; even if we ignored everything else and assumed that software patents were OK for things that deserved them, the people in charge of patents don't have anywhere near the kind of knowledge necessary to make intelligent decisions.<p>Those are my reasons for opposing software patents. It makes development a complete minefield, and only the big guys can afford to wade through that. I just have to hope that I don't do anything too successful until the patent laws are revoked or until I make enough money not to care.",1261539350

1011466,comment,1010372,1010372,0,0,kentosi,,,"I've got a few points and opinions to throw out here.<p>Firstly, after reading a lot of comments here it seems that many people are talking about how NOT to get into management and stay with the job you love (particularly in reference to programming).<p>Though this sentiment relates to this article I also find it somewhat disconnected in the context of Mark and Ted's opinions of their roles.  A lot of commenters clearly seem like they're already in established programming roles with a degree of authority they enjoy, whereas these two guys in the article aren't.  They're new to their company, and are striving to get to a place where they're satisfied (quite the opposite situation from many of the commenters).<p>Next, the general message I gathered from this article is that being successful in an organisation is apparently about having an awareness of your surroundings and making small yet persistent changes without getting in the way of others.  Doing the opposite, which in Ted's case was shameless self-promotion, working hard, working overtime and being highly-strung with a drive to get further is not the way to succeed.<p>Now I find this VERY debatable, because a lot of it is subjective to the organisation's culture.  What's to say that in another organisation that values aggressive proactiveness Ted would've been promoted instead, while Mark would have taken another year or two to move up?  You cannot teach people how to be successful in management based on one case-study.  Furthermore, each staff had no idea of their performance until the actual bonus time and hence were kept in the dark.  There's something wrong here if Ted was convinced he was on the right track.  Isn't this what mid-year reviews are all about?<p>The key messages I can see here are to have an aim, observe and adapt.  Mark had an aim, which was to somehow distinguish himself from the pack.  He observed his environment and he adapted.  Ted had an aim too (promotion + bonus), which he clearly observed because he seemed to have worked his butt off.  Having failed to get his promotion he now has to adapt (move to a new company, change his ways, whatever).<p>The story isn't finished yet.  A year later tables could turn.  Mark could get comfortable with where he is and slip, while Ted could make it very big.",1261538912

There are always those whos agenda (which might even be legit) it serves to tell people they are being screwed.<p>In every country in the world there are powerful people going around with that message.<p>Rich Countries:<p><pre><code>  * You are expected to make emitting carbon more expensive here then it is in other countries. That means that steel mills, factories & the like will shut down & reopened in China. Jobs will be shipped overseas(embellishment) No emissions are prevented since the factory gets reopened in India/China anyway.\n\n  * This is a plan to tax US/EU suppliers a& transfer this money to China/India. \n</code></pre>\nPoor Countries:<p><pre><code>  * You are expected to pay for the problems created by those countries with over 100 years of industrialized history. \n\n  * Going by 1990 levels means dividing a world environmental resource. Since we were polluting 1/5 as much as US/EU in 1990, we get a smaller slice in the future. (related) This deal means that whoever polluted in the past is entitled to polluted in the future.  \n\n  *There is a known quantity (whatever it takes to get from 380 to 450 ppm) of carbon we can emmit globally. Divide that by 6 billion.\n\n</code></pre>\nEach one of these arguments is true in a way.",1261538691

The way you test the software is going to be the same no matter what programming language you use.  Within a specific programming paradigm, how you build the software is a shear matter of syntax, all the parts are going to have to be the same.</i><p>I disbelieve.<p>I've been in a situation where I was creating a reporting system, and was sitting in a group of people building a website.  There was absolutely no similarity in requirements, testing, rollout procedures, and turnaround expectations between me and the other developers.  This despite the fact that we were working in the same organization, on projects specified by the same product managers!<p>As for a specific programming paradigm comment, the statement seems to me to be vacuously true because you define ""paradigm"" to include the internal structure of the software, or else false.  Because I've seen many cases where two people deliver essentially the same functionality using the same basic toolkit, but the internal organization, pieces, etc are completely different.<p><i>COBOL, C, C#, Clojure, C-whatever-next, it doesn't matter. Wood, stone, and iron. The principles haven't changed much at all.</i><p>Huh?  COBOL doesn't even have recursion.  C has function pointers but no closures.  C# has closures but no Lisp style macros.  Clojure has all of the above.  The capabilities of the languages are different, and therefore the proper design and structure of software is as well.<p>Also where principles have not changed, people's understanding of them may.  For instance take test driven development.  It isn't new - when Larry Wall delivered Perl 1 in the mid-80s it came with a reasonably complete test suite.  When CPAN was founded in the mid-90s the whole perl Makefile.pl, make, make test, make install routine was already standard.  And the result was that Perl got a good name for being portable in practice.<p>However as recently as a decade ago you'd have been hard pressed to find many advocating a test driven style of development.  Problems existed that it would work well for.  Useful enough tools existed for people to take advantage of them.  But there wasn't wide spread acceptance of that knowledge.<p>Today if you are a programmer and <i>don't</i> know the basics of unit testing, you need some remedial re-education.  And a lot of organizations don't use it.<p>In short unit testing today is where source control was in the late 90s which is where structured programming was in the 80s.  It is a good idea.  It is widely recognized to be a good idea.  But it is a good idea that is more honored by the breach than the observance in your average programming shop.",1261537624

Which brings me to the header of my comment. I don't see in any way how your launch was a ""failure"".  You have ""fail"" and ""sucked"" peppered throughout your post. Why!<p><i>I wasn’t too surprised or worried by the results, since that was more or less what I expected.</i><p>2 problems here: Why expect failure? And secondly, can't call it a waste of time then since you knew beforehand what you were getting into - your choice.<p>Not trying to shoot you down more - quite the opposite! I don't see how your launch was a failure at all. You have more data than 100% of people with ""ideas"" and 100% of people in ""stealth mode"". And how is you gaining traffic an epic fail? Even if its one user! I see a positive slope in that graph damnit!<p>Personally I have erased the concept of ""failing"" from existence. Simply because if all things are trials, then you benefit from data received back. It doesn't matter whether that data is ""good"" or ""bad"", data is data. And one does trials so one can get better at doing those trials! So you fail when you die, till then don't recognize its existence.<p>Be happy man.<p>My graphs have a scale of 1-10 (yes im serious). so when i start to see the 1-100 (like yours) I will be ass-happy.<p>=) Congratulations!",1261537309

We would then only get the deep work (of academics) and the user-driven hill-climbing (of open source/big corporations).<p>I guess startups like Appjet (etherpad) are an exception... but, according to their early webpage, they had a software patent. Which Google may have wanted when it acquired them. I expect that Dropbox, which also has some cool proprietary technology, also sought to patent it, given pg's position <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html</a><p>While a startup can protect itself by growing and innovating fast, I have a soft spot for the deep technical innovator. I appreciate those incremental hill-climbing innovations; the cool stuff in the labs that never actually becomes usable; and the clever identification of markets and exploitation thereof. But the revolutionary stuff is what I love.<p>I'm always surprised that so many developers, who I would think are creative types, don't think deep innovation deserves the encouragement and reward of protection.<p>Note that Xerox PARC was funded by patents (on xerography); and Bell Labs' origin can be traced to a patent (on telephony).",1261537248

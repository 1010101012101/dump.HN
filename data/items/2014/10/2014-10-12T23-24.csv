8446960,comment,8446575,8446575,0,0,_delirium,,,"I can believe that, but it doesn&#x27;t by itself show the full effect of the patent system. The <i>threat</i> of a legal case is important in a lot of places where no actual legal case develops. For example, Stanford&#x27;s CCRMA computer-music research lab has been funded over the past few decades largely by patent royalties, from licensing patents to synth-makers like Yamaha. IMO that&#x27;s an example of the patent system functioning largely as intended: R&D group develops something, licenses it to a commercialization group, which develops a product and pays a small percentage as royalties to the R&D group. No court actual court case happened anywhere here, because everyone played by the rules. Yet the <i>possibility</i> of one was necessary, or else there&#x27;d be no reason for Yamaha to pay anything at all.<p>So for a full picture of the effect of the patent system, I think you need to look at total licensing royalties, including both court-ordered and contractually agreed ones.",1413157715

The threat of this kind of asset freezing was used at least as far back as the Drexel Burnham Lambert investigation in the 80s.<p>&quot;The threat of a RICO indictment unnerved many at Drexel. A RICO indictment would have required the firm to put up a performance bond of as much as $1 billion in lieu of having its assets frozen. This provision was put in the law because organized crime had a habit of absconding with the funds of indicted companies, and the writers of RICO wanted to make sure there was something to seize or forfeit in the event of a guilty verdict. Unfortunately, most of Drexel&#x27;s capital was borrowed money, as is common with most Wall Street firms (in Drexel&#x27;s case, 96 percent—by far the most of any firm). This debt would have to take second place to this performance bond. Additionally, if the bond ever had to be paid, Drexel&#x27;s stockholders would have been all but wiped out. Due to this, banks will not extend credit to a firm under a RICO indictment.[5]<p>By this time, several Drexel executives—including Joseph—concluded that Drexel could not survive a RICO indictment and would have to seek a settlement with Giuliani.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel_Burnham_Lambert"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel_Burnham_Lambert</a>",1413157244

Write some basic synthesis code(naive oscillator and volume envelope) and some way of sequencing it. Write little toy trackers and some procedural audio with this technique.<p>2. Try and fail a few times to write dataflow engine for audio like Pure Data. (this is kind of a big project and it turns out, you really don&#x27;t need it to experiment.)<p>3. Write Standard MIDI Format playback system for a one-voice PC beeper emulation. This turns out to be a gateway drug for me learning more in depth because all you have to do is add &quot;just one more&quot; feature and every MIDI file you play sounds a little better.<p>4. Expand MIDI playback and synthesizer in tandem. End up with polyphonic .WAV sampler, then Soundfont playback. Learn everything about DSP badly, and gradually correct misconceptions. (DSP material can be tricky since the math concepts map to illegible code, and a lot of the resources are for general engineering applications instead of audio.)<p>5. Rewrite things and work on custom subtractive synthesizer, after getting everything wrong a few times over in the first synthesis engine. Still do not know to write nice sounding IIR filters; steal a good free implementation instead.<p>And that is where I stand today. I know enough to engineer complex signal chains, how some of the common formats are structured, and some tricks for improving sound quality and optimizing CPU time; what I miss is the background for writing original signal processing algorithms, which gets really specialized(there are some people who devote themselves entirely to reverbs, for example).

The first you cast to halfway up the side of the coin lying flat and once it sets you rub grease over the top of everything and then cast the over half. Once everything has dried the two half split apart easy. We put in little sticks into the first cast sticking up 5mm so that the two halves could be aligned again after removing the coin.

I do RNA work quite frequently, (high quality) RNA preparation is finicky and involves reagents you can&#x27;t buy as a normal person and equipment that may not be &quot;specialized&quot; but isn&#x27;t in your standard Gen practitioners office and definitely in effectively 0 homes.  High throughput RNA extraction -- which is what their Mastermix is -- yields OK-ish quality RNA but works fairly well if you have well optimized RT-primers.  There are several caveats to quick extractions though, the two big ones for this product are it doesn&#x27;t work well for human tissue or blood samples and they&#x27;re either not doing very much testing (literally only 96 specific tests) or they&#x27;re doing broad range testing and not using optimized primers because there&#x27;s not a lot of RNA in any given sample.  My guess is a combination of the two, there&#x27;s a reason why the real microarrays we run for research are both expensive and time consuming.<p>Doctors already &quot;test&quot; for things, and by that we mean the doctors have nurses do a blood draw and that blood draw is sent the the hospital lab. And the hospital lab does the testing. Even with this device, it&#x27;s still the hospital lab that&#x27;s going to do the testing. Your lab results don&#x27;t necessarily take a while to come back because they&#x27;re hard or cumbersome or take a ton of time to do, they take a while because the lab is running more than just your samples and your doctor has more than one patient (and also might like to sleep at some point). Most labs (that don&#x27;t need something like culturing) can easily come back in less than 24hours and assuming you were the only one could come back in just a few hours.<p>I see no reason to give them the benefit of the doubt, they&#x27;ve shown nothing to merit it.

The overall approach leaves the critical question of service-specific security policy development out of scope.<p>We&#x27;ve had NSA SEL since 2000, the reason it&#x27;s rarely used is that regular people don&#x27;t have time to grok that level of detail. In response, we have things like <i>grsec</i> learning mode.<p>As with any time app-specific ACLs are brought out, the <i>real</i> question here is process, not technology. I would argue that what is really needed is not a kernel-specific solution or a protocol-specific solution (noticed how many of the new SOA infrastructure half-solutions are HTTP-only or port-level only regarding network policy?) but rather a generic, industry-wide approach toward multi-faceted security policy generation for arbitrary services including all aspects of service behavior (at both host and network levels). That in turn requires a virtualization paradigm, networking paradigm and OS neutral service devops process. This is something that we are moving towards slowly (eg. widespread <i>git</i> use, standardish build tools, containers, VLANs), but is not widely discussed.<p>We have the tools in major kernels already: syscall monitoring, relatively mature multi-subsystem security policies, network ACLs and monitoring systems, increasingly sophisticated networking virtualization solutions like Open vSwtich, filesystem-neutral monitoring. The pain in the ass is putting it all together in an average-app grokkable manner that doesn&#x27;t demand comprehension of low-level OS internals from regular developers, nitpicking application behaviour comprehension from operations infrastructure, or the employment of security nerds to reap the benefits of some of the available lower-level technologies.<p>I fear commercial offerings will never take us to this position: it&#x27;s simply not an easy sell (intangible, long term benefits vs. shorter overall timeframe and less cognitive overhead / requisite management grok for current and familiar development processes) and too complex to implement .. in most cases requiring a complete devops process change. Instead, I predict that we will slowly see open source devops tools layer upon RCS/VCS to provide a common continuous integration / deployment process that integrates effective multi-subsystem application profiling for security policy development in parallel to regression tests and other pre-deployment processes.<p>Further personal thoughts on this area @ <a href=""http://stani.sh/walter/pfcts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stani.sh/walter/pfcts</a>",1413155924

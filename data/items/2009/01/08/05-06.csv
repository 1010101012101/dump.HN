Let communities of people who care do the work for you.  If you can provide some sort of platform, even if it is something as simple as: ""140 chars or less text comments, sent to people who choose to see them, and allowing these text comments to be sent from multiple sources.""<p>Don't get me started about how over hyped twitter is.  It's got a great name and got insanely lucky with its adoption... and if someone could write up a blog entry about how they got so popular that would be great as well.  They must have had some popular early adopters.<p>Back to the ""app a day"" (pun intended) topic.  I wonder to myself, are these apps meant to make money, or are they just people playing around?  Have any serious twitter apps, besides summize, been acquired?<p>I think the more abstract trend, at the moment, is ""hack something together in a few days and see what happens.""  Things along the line of <a href=""http://nowdothis.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nowdothis.com</a>.<p>My gut tells me they see a spike in traffic, then nobody really cares.

Undergrads started saying declarative sentences with interrogative intonation-- as if they were actually questions.  This allowed one to disclaim some responsibility for whatever one was saying, and yet at the same time to compel a response from the other person.<p>This way of speaking has now passed down to high school students and isn't associated with any specific sort of ideas (unless you count the empty set as a type of idea), but it was originally quite a nasty piece of conversational jiujitsu.",1231394209

There's been lots of interbreeding. (This is Africa, after all.) But, they still exist. The situation is rather like that in Latin American, where after five centuries of interbreeding, the economic elites are still pretty white-looking, and the indigenous masses occasionally organize under demagogues like Hugo Chavez to fight back.</i>",1231393871

These almost always succeed.  At the other extreme there are people who seem to have no ability to do this; they need a boss to motivate them.  In the middle there is a large band of people who have some, but not unlimited, ability to motivate themselves.  These can succeed through careful morale management (and some luck).<p>I'd say about a quarter to a third of founders we fund have never-give-up morale.  The rest are mostly in the middle group.<p>For the people in the middle group, I think the big danger is not knowing what to do next. That's why it's so important to launch early.  Once you get something in front of users, they tell you what to do next. Not that you should do exactly what they tell you; you have to guess what they really need.

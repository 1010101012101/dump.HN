584878,comment,584797,584797,0,0,delano,,,"<i>One of the most important differences between rich people and non-rich people: Rich people plan for things before they need them, while others are caught treading water when something bad happens. Think about how to apply this to your life.</i><p>If I'm being really optimistic, I can take this to mean, <i>rich people become rich because they plan ahead and non-rich people stay non-rich because they don't</i>. I have to be <i>really</i> optimistic to read it that way and it's dubious advice anyhow.<p>So let's take the analogy a bit further. We have a person treading water. They know they need to figure something out because they can't tread water indefinitely. Then something bad happens. Crap, maybe a shark shows up or a lightning storm rolls in, whatever it is, it's not cool. Ramit Sethi leans in to give this poor person some advice. ""Let me tell you something. You could be rich right now if you had just planned ahead.""<p>Useless!",1241005255

I think the hype is bad for Twitter, it makes people aware of the service before any of their friends are on there, so they try it, subscribe to Stephen Fry and Jeff Atwood and then give up.<p>Me and a few of my friends in the UK .net development world are on there but we go days between tweets because that's what everyone else is doing. There's no conversation for me at the moment. At this point I'm just sitting on my user account and waiting for the network to become worth being a part of.",1241004538

Not to mention that it's the all too familiar dilution of the word ""startup"" where ""website"" would be more apt.<p>At least if they were just called websites it wouldn't have the false air of them somehow being companies afterwards and it'd be easier for me to not be cynical of the time people spend on them.",1241003337

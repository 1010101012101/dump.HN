I'm not a fan of Steve Jobs, but I admire his pursuit of ""the good"", even if I didn't agree with his definitions of ""good"". And maybe something to stop and think about is that his discussions with family about furniture were <i>time spent building connections with them</i>.<p>Also, it's always fascinated me how some people say that people are absolutely more important than ideas, when that is an idea itself. Sometimes spending too much time finding ""the best"" can be a waste of time, but absolutism in either direction is a bad thing. Maybe taking some time to pick a better car will save you time and money and stress in the long run because it won't break down on you as often.<p>I can understand your Tyler Durden reaction to the article (""the things you own end up owning you""), but sometimes being responsible and buying something that won't end up in a landfill is the right thing to do.",1352397578

Red Hat didn't like the license,  and ever since,  Linux has had a plurality of broken desktops and none that work.<p>The oddest thing is that the developers just haven't realized how bad their products are,  or that the Linux desktop experience has been consistently getting worse over time.<p>Look at Unity in Ubuntu.  All the most basic things,  like cut and paste,  scrollbars,  and window resizing are FUBAR.  Rather than recognizing the world-class nature of the shell environment and providing a better <i>-term application,  we just get bloated terminals for which cut-and-paste almost works.<p>(I'll admit the system monitor app that comes with Ubuntu is pretty,  but I wonder how it makes the CPU go to 25% on a machine that's capable of high-end gaming)<p>This year I learned how to make a ""Linux desktop"" that's better than all of them.  I run Windows 7 or 8,  then I install Ubuntu inside of VirtualBox.  Most of the time I ssh into it with a putty terminal,  which is much better than any </i>-term in Linux?  (Why?  Why can't Linux make a *-term that's better,  or at least not worse,  than xterm was in 1993?)  Most X Windows apps work great with the cygwin X server,  getting managed by Microsoft Windows.<p>The biggest problem is that the people developing this garbage don't have any idea of how bad it is.

4758911,comment,4758603,4758828,3,0,wsul,,,"Great points.<p>1. We think in the categories we compete -- polos, tee shirts, etc, we are comparable (and strive to be better!) in quality and style to Lacoste, RL, James Perse, etc. These companies use great inputs, and the biggest difference in the actual design will be our lack of logo. We think that, in itself, makes a statement, and we hope there are a lot of people like us who appreciate the statement that it makes. We aspire to have higher quality and more consistent style than Uniqlo and American Apparel.<p>Yes -- people are paying premiums to other brands, and some of it, for some people is aspirational. We hope people will pay for quality, and if anything, vote with their dollar for a company that reflects their value. We don't want to charge a premium for that though. Our values will be present in the brand by necessity, because we're going to be detailing all along the way of how we're building our company.<p>2. To us the biggest problems with fit are intra-brand consistency and intra-style consistency. Many manufacturers have poor quality control and a single shirt in the same size will come off with vastly different measurements. ex: <a href=""http://reviews.urbanoutfitters.com/5309/15787476/bdg-v-neck-tee-reviews/reviews.htm?reviewID=24255028"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reviews.urbanoutfitters.com/5309/15787476/bdg-v-neck-...</a>
we'll never, ever have this happen. Quality & consistency is of utmost importance to us.<p>We want you to find the size that works best for you (they all have an inch or two leeway) and once you know it, you can order without worry. Even before then, you can, because we offer free returns, paid postage both ways, but we want the experience to be pleasant from day one. We're pioneering a bunch of ways to make the experience as easy as possible including FitPaks, true-to-measure sizes, questionnaires we've devised, accurate photos of real people, and many, many other things -- but we're always open to ideas!<p>We hope you'll follow along and continue to give us candid feedback.

4758877,comment,4756590,4757229,1,0,Xylakant,,,"> At first sight, it seems hard to make a primary ordering of programming languages, because they focus on different areas (ease of use, speed of development, performance etc) and ordering those disjunct areas against each other seems to be impossible. However, it is still possible for a programming language to focus and excel on all those areas at the same time.<p>I disagree. There's more than ease of use, speed of development and performance to determine if a language is ""better"" suited to a problem than others. And they're all trade-offs to some point. So to excel at one means that you fall behind on others. Prolog is still used heavily in some areas since it's a natural fit to logic problems. It's just pure logic theory modeled in a programming language. It's a pityful language to solve most ""real world"" problems, but it excels at what it was made for. So is it ""better"" than ruby? I don't think so. Is it possible to write a language that models logic problems so nicely as Prolog and still keep the ease of use of ruby? I very much doubt that.",1352396996

That being said, I'm explaining what benefits it gives me.<p>> I see that it is also for Mac and Windows<p>Seriously? Don't know about Mac, but do you really consider Windows to be ""extensible"" or customizable? Out of the box, Enlightenment supports full scripting capabilities (think AutoHotKey - everything you do can be done by sending a command to E17 server from terminal) and theming with which you can make it look as you wish (<a href=""http://e17-stuff.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://e17-stuff.org/</a>). It's built-in. On Windows you need expensive Stardock Window Blinds (IIRC) and clumsy AutoHotKey to get the same functionality - and then it gets slow, while E17 remains lightning fast.<p>As for ""fast""... Well, take a look at this quote:<p>""For full functionality 64MB or more is suggested. As little as a 200Mhz ARM core will provide sufficient processing power (depending on needs)"" (<a href=""http://www.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=about&l=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=about&l=en</a>)<p>Now try and use Windows 7 on a machine with 64MB of RAM :)<p>I actually use E17 as my only WM at work (on FreeBSD at that). I almost never touch the mouse for WM related tasks; combine with VIM as an editor and Vrome in Chromium and I almost never touch the mouse, period. It's fast (starts up in 3-4 seconds), responsive (changing virtual desktops while CPU is being fully used by gcc is as fast as on standby) and in the past year I didn't encounter even a single bug (I remember in the past when something went wrong and E crashed, it used to display a message in the console: ""Bad programmer! Naughty programmer! SPANK, SPANK, SPANK! Now go and fix your code!"" - but I didn't have a chance to see if it's still the case). Customizable to ridiculous extent and looks quite a lot better than ratpoison.<p>The only thing I'd like to see is a smart tiling manager extension. Preferably turned on/off on per virtual desktop basis. It probably will be done in the future. In the meantime E17 remains the only WM that is both fast and pretty, and which goes out of your way without imposing anything on you while providing sane defaults.<p>Ok, that's just my opinion; fans of XFCE, Black/Busy/etcbox, Xmonad and others can argue.

I'm happy to edit this post to avoid that intensely but shallowly interesting stuff.<p>In the UK there are moves to reduce the time limits for abortion.  At the moment it is possible for a woman to have an abortion at under 24 weeks.<p>The science comes in because politicians say that it's possible for infants to survive if they're born under 24 weeks, and that's one reason to reduce the limits.<p>The problems are:<p>- we do not have abortion on demand in the UK.  There can be delays in getting the tests and etc.  This is one reason why abortions are sometimes carried out over 12 weeks.  Changing the law to allow abortion on demand under 12 weeks may increase the numbers of those abortions, but also decrease the numbers of abortions carried out over 12 weeks.<p>- very few abortions are carried out at over 20 weeks.  It's likely to be distressing for the woman and her partner.  It's almost certainly because the child has a condition incompatible with life.  This isn't just a child who will live a short and miserable life of a few years; it is a child who will live at most a few days.  Reducing the time limits will increase the number of women forced to carry this child to term, and to give birth to it, and to watch it die after a few hours or days.<p>- Survivability of infants born under 24 weeks is not great.  Doctors spend a lot of time (and money) making big interventions to keep these children alive.  Many doctors and nurses do not feel that these interventions are humane.<p>You're right that most of the decisions to be made about abortion are purely moral, but some people are making scientificky claims for their position.

4758655,comment,4757979,4757979,10,0,w0utert,,,"As a dutchman, I have to comment on this:<p>>> <i>In the Dutch electoral system, this can't happen. Two months before the elections, every political party is expected to submit a detailed budget plan to a non-partisan agency called the Central Plan Bureau (CPB), which plays a role similar to the Congressional Budget Office in America. The CPB produces an analysis of the economic consequences of those budget plans. The effects are assessed in detail for 2013-2017, and there's also a prognosis for 2040 to discourage parties from larding up their budgets with short-term candy that leads to negative long-term consequences.</i><p>So, what happens instead, is that all parties write up their budget plan in a way that they expect will yield the most favorable CPB calculations for their intended audience. Contrary to most voters, they realize full well that most of their plans will never be realized, because the Dutch political systems is built around political coalitions, where multiple parties (typically 2, 3 or 4) have to make compromises. Almost inevitably, this means the sharp edges are taken off, and typically it's exactly the sharp edges that influence the CPB calculations the most.<p>>> <i>The CPB's report came out Monday, and most parties had their strong and weak points. Of the two parties most likely to win the elections, the Liberals did well on deficit-cutting and long-term job creation but hiked income inequality and hurt household purchasing power; the Socialists did well on purchasing power and jobs in the short run but had low employment growth in the long run.</i><p>In the mean time, we had our elections, and the resulting coalition comprises the liberal party (VVD) and the socalist party (PvdA). Together, they negotiated their plans for the coming 4 years. And guess what: the net effect of these plans is almost the exact opposite of what the 2 parties have been advertising during election time.<p>The liberal party agreed to health care reforms that will actually decrease income inequality, and will have a huge impact on upper middle class incomes, up to 10% net income loss. They also agreed to cut tax benefits for home owners, which again mostly hurts upper middle class incomes. In exchange, the socialists agreed on labor market reforms that will cut unemployment benefits, and on housing market reforms that will increase the cost of living for people who rent, usually people with lower incomes.<p>The last few weeks there has been a raging debate here, because voters on both sides feel cheated. People who voted the liberal party feel particularly cheated, because the current plans hurt them disproportionally, while at the same time they will destroy jobs, reduce consumer spending, and hence are very bad for economic growth. The only rationale for these measurements is redistribution of wealth, which the socialists traded for reducing social security. All iof this goes against everything the liberal party stands for, never ever have the liberals even hinted that they would agree with such measures.<p>So tl;dr: Even though the unbiased analysis of the plans the different parties have reduces fact-free policies, it's far from a guarantee that after the elections, the winning parties will simply make a 180 degree turn and screw you over anyway.",1352394287

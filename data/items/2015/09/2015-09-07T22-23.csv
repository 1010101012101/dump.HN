Indeed, Haskell loves to just cut through the bullshit about math and be inconsistent: bottom inhabits every type, and Type inhabits Type (in Dependent Haskell).<p>No fixed mathematical system is capable of formally verifying all programs, or even all <i>interesting</i> programs.  You always need more bits of axioms than of program if you want to prove theorems about your programs (Chaitin&#x27;s principle, proved formally by Calude).<p>What we can say for FP is that Fast and Loose Reasoning is Morally Correct, and that if we use nicely categorical constructions, then when our programs happen to terminate at all, those nice constructions describe their behavior.",1441666381

10183378,comment,10183156,10183270,0,0,i_s,,,"Types do have a lot of benefits but they also come with a big cost: some programs are very hard to express in modern type systems. For example, consider a pattern that is becoming more common today in UI programming (even in plain javascript): keeping your UI in one big tree data structure, and then working on arbitrary paths (represented by a sequence of keys) into that data structure. That is not a pattern you can encode in a type system.<p>Types also come with a lot of inherent complexity that you don&#x27;t get with dynamic programs. Recently, I wrote a Type Provider for web Routing in F#, and it is orders of magnitude more complicated than what a dynamic approach would have been. It is nice that it is not possible to express a program that uses route parameters the wrong way, or provide a route that is unreachable, etc, but it takes a lot more work than a dynamic version with no such safety.<p>One domain where I think static typing is worth it is for parsing. After having used FParsec to parse a structure, and also having tried it dynamically, I felt the static typing added little complexity for all the safety it brought, so it was very much worth it. But there are also some dynamic parsing libraries that much easier to get started with, such as Instaparse, so YMMV.",1441666065

10183359,comment,10181931,10181931,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> <i>What factors should I consider before buying any one of their packages.</i><p>Since nobody answered this part:<p>First, I don&#x27;t recommend having your web hosting and your domain registration with the same company. It&#x27;s convenient, and most people will never have a problem with it. But, when someone does have a problem with it, having both hosting and domain registration with the same company can make things harder. If your account is suspended for some reason, you lose access to <i>everything</i>; if your hosting is with a different company and you lose access to the domain name, you can get another domain name up and running with minimal effort and point it to your hosting company. If you have a problem with the hosting, you can keep your domain and set up new hosting. Either way, you have half as much trouble as you&#x27;d have if you were using a package deal.<p>Second, take a very close look at their terms of service. Anybody can have a bad experience with an otherwise good company; terms of service tells you what kind of company you&#x27;re likely to be dealing with. People have pointed out elsewhere in the thread significant issues with Gandi&#x27;s terms of service, for example. Another one is NearlyFreeSpeech.net: if you ever have a problem with your NearlyFreeSpeech.net service and you try to get a freelancer like me to help you out with it, that freelancer will find it nearly impossible to work with NFS. You <i>really</i> don&#x27;t want to hitch your wagon to a business that will make it unnecessarily difficult to work with their support when something has gone wrong.<p>Third, speaking of support, take a very very close look at what kind of support they offer. Gandi doesn&#x27;t offer phone support; if you have an urgent problem, you have to rely on email along with all of its crappy other issues and their really slow turnaround time. Look for someone that offers phone support, and before ordering service, go ahead and give the phone support a call and see how difficult it is to reach a live person, what the wait times are like, and how easy it is to understand the tech support person. When you do reach someone, just tell them you waned to see what their support was like before ordering service, they&#x27;ll understand. (It&#x27;ll be an easy trouble ticket for them to close.)<p>Do NOT go with the cheapest possible domain registrar. It&#x27;s just not worth it. The most expensive registrars are like 15 bucks a year for most common TLDs. Going with the cheapest possible one might get you down around $3 a year, so you&#x27;re saving a dollar a month to buy yourself a headache in the future. There are a couple of domain registrars to avoid: Network Solutions (because they make transfers extraordinarily difficult and because their web interface is confusing as hell) and Gandi (nonexistent/terrible support and stupid ToS).<p>Be careful about going with cheap hosting services. Most of them will put you on a shared plan that will guarantee that your site will go down if it ever gets a little bit of traffic. Most of them have really stupid server configurations that can make managing multiple sites really confusing. I&#x27;ve seen some horrifying security policies and responses from several companies (HostGator immediately comes to mind). NearlyFreeSpeech.net is the cheapest possible web hosting, but they don&#x27;t offer mail hosting and if you ever need support there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;re out of luck. They specifically do NOT want to have newbies for customers.<p>GoDaddy has been a big bad problem often in the past, so what I&#x27;m about to say makes me a little sick to my stomach, but: they&#x27;re really not so bad anymore. I&#x27;ve had some excellent experiences with their support over the last year, and they&#x27;re one of the few companies that offers phone support for everything. Their support people -- most of them, not all of them -- know how to use a commandline and can poke around in server configurations and can talk to you at a level you&#x27;ll understand. I don&#x27;t hate having to deal with GoDaddy anymore. That said, do NOT use their mail hosting, they have significant problems with it and nobody there seems to know how to fix it. And nobody&#x27;s wrong for telling you to stay away from GoDaddy, they&#x27;ve had a well-deserved awful reputation for a long time.<p>Lastly: if you really don&#x27;t have much money, and you&#x27;re just getting started, and you don&#x27;t need anything very fancy (or controversial, I don&#x27;t make enough money to put up with the headache of supporting a hate site), contact me at my email address in my profile. I will register a domain for you for free (and make sure you have full access and control of it) and also host it for free, mail service included. I admin my own servers. I don&#x27;t offer the very fastest support response in the world, but you&#x27;ll have a phone number you can call. I&#x27;ve done this for a couple of other people on HN and no complaints so far (as far as I know).",1441665705

As usual, there would be an arms race between opposing political powers, so hopefully those making the decisions keep human existence as the highest priority. We don&#x27;t need a &quot;doomsday machine&quot; in the form of a singularity. Anyway, your suggestion of a perpetual desire of the system to keep humans around is a good idea. Another good idea could be to have it stop and ask the humans for approval to continue after every so many iterations, thus keeping the people in control. This would prevent a never-ending auto-growth mode and allow changes to the plans as times changed.<p>Overall, the possibilities are pretty much endless, just like with most types of software. Whether it be one or multiple entities probably depends on design. Nature chose multiple entities, with the ever so curious sexed species that require two individuals to make a new hybrid at each testing iteration. Bacteria, on the other hand, are asexual and reproduce through binary fission. But of course a thinking self-creator is a different ball game. It would probably be fruitful to have some sort of end goal built into the system, rather than having it consume resources simply to become as computationally immense as possible. For example, perhaps its goal could be to solve a set of questions humans have about the universe, and perhaps it would stop iterating once all those questions were answered satisfactorily. In a way it could serve as a god that answered people&#x27;s questions. Then again, perhaps we are all living in a simulation running on the singularity of an earlier universe, and who knows how many turtles that spans.",1441664259

People are still spending time waiting, they just have to do it in a more roundabout way.

But then it&#x27;s no different from the case for peak-hour pricing (or the opposite in the case of happy hours and early bird specials).<p>It doesn&#x27;t make it more expensive at peak times.

If you ask a sufficiently sophisticated computer algebra system (SageMath, for example) to multiply two large polynomials with integer or rational coefficients, chances are that it will reduce the problem to multiplying two large integers, then reduce that problem to multiplying two large polynomials (but different from the ones you started with), and then proceed using recursive polynomial and integer multiplications to compute that product... (i.e. going through a sequence of transformations Z[x] -> Z -> Z[x] -> ...)",1441663964

Your tasks would need to be either written in async style, or you&#x27;d need to spawn new processes from within Twisted (but built-in functionality makes this rather easy). Still, Twisted is <i>rock-solid</i>, doesn&#x27;t leak and is capable of handling <i>a lot</i> of (IO-bound) tasks concurrently.<p>If your tasks are CPU bound you pretty much have no choice other than something based on multiprocessing. You can still use Twisted, but only in the second way. If the code of your tasks doesn&#x27;t use C extensions you could use Jython with threads. This way you&#x27;d get parallelism without having to rewrite much code.<p>If you need your tasks parallelized and you want to run a lot of them concurrently then I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re out of options in Pythonland. Personally I&#x27;d go for Erlang with ErlPort, but I know Erlang rather well.<p>On the other hand, Celery is a nice piece of code. I think in most cases you don&#x27;t need anything else, or at least nothing drastically different, like the options above. Perhaps rq would be a good idea.

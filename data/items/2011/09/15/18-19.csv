I try to avoid using adverbs, but if an adverb is necessary, I try to place it after the verb it is modifying, not before.<p>Another recent habit is the infinitive split with a negative: ""I asked him to not do that any more,"" rather than: ""I asked him not to do that any more.""<p>An unsplit negative can sometimes lead readers down a garden path, but that usually indicates a need to rethink the sentence, for example to reframe it without a negative: ""I asked him to stop doing that.""",1316113110

3001456,comment,2997952,2997952,1,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"I'd like to respond to a few of the comments here.<p>Jeremy imagines correctly.  This blog post was essentially a continuation of the subject on the node mailing list, and particularly the assumption that if you feel you shouldn't compile to JS, then you should just write in Assembly, or that JavaScript is only worth using if you want to be ""closer to the metal"".  I believe that these points of view are wrong.<p>Yes, of course I'm aware that C++ was originally cross-compiled to C.  That's why I chose it for the analogy, like Lassie on display in the Louvre.  People tend to take comparison that as either a compliment to CoffeeScript, or an insult, depending on their feelings about C++ vs C.  I consider both interpretations to be correct.<p>I have no problem with people compiling to JavaScript, though I personally prefer dealing with JavaScript directly.  I like stack traces with line numbers that correspond to the line numbers in my editor, and it's not such a bad language.  One of the biggest things I've found lacking with both Node and Browser JS is post-hoc debugging.  Syntax sugar doesn't help with that.  I'd be much more excited about efforts to produce state-capturing crash dumps that would let a developer revisit an error condition and investigate it after the fact.  Other language have this, and it makes me very envious.<p>""Expressiveness"" is a measure of how many tokens are required to write programs.  Read some of pg's essays about arc and blub.  A less than 10x increase would still be relevant, but.. well... meh.  It's not a major leap in power that Assembly to C is, or C to JavaScript is.<p>Increases in expressiveness often come at the cost of also increasing the difficulty of reasoning about programs' precise behavior, but increase the ability to reason about their intent.  Reading assembly isn't exactly fun (in my opinion), but it's also quite clear exactly what the computer is doing -- so much so that it can be tricky to figure out exactly what the human was trying to accomplish.<p>C is much more humane, and still pretty clear what's going on.  It's an obvious sweet spot for many tasks.  JavaScript, on the other hand, runs on this huge black box, but it's much more expressive than C (and thus, much easier to write), and it runs in web browsers (which makes it inescapable), doesn't require a compilation step, and is quite fast for a lot of tasks.  I've yet to see any similar leap from a to-JS language.  They're just other high level languages that all have pretty much the same basic set of features.  A lot of them are a bit nicer than JS, but they lack JavaScript's relevance factor.<p>I must not be a very good writer, because people often read things I write, and seem to come away with the impression that I have these strong prescriptive views about syntax and coding style.  I don't.  The reason I'm so unenthused is because most high level languages don't really seem to differ all that much.  Coding style doesn't solve very many problems, and the problems it does solve aren't particularly hard.",1316111019

And I refuse to say that Louis XIV was poor simply because he didn't have air conditioning.<p>While someone who has to decide between food and rent money, despite having a plasma TV bought two years ago, before losing a job due to protracted illness, is poor.<p>There's a simple resolution to this - what do you define as poor? How many people in the US do you consider are poor? Are people now significantly less poor than they were in 1970, and how do you measure that?<p>Since you don't like the baseline of Wikipedia, I point you to the US Census Department at <a href=""http://www.census.gov/hhes/povmeas/publications/orshansky.html#C2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/hhes/povmeas/publications/orshansky.ht...</a> (next two paragraphs)<p>Orshansky accurately described her poverty thresholds as a ""relatively absolute"" measure of poverty(60), inasmuch as they were developed from calculations that made use of the consumption patterns (at a particular point in time) of the U.S. population as a whole. (In the dichotomy between relative and absolute definitions of poverty, one of the essential characteristics of a purely ""absolute"" definition of poverty is that it is derived without any reference to the consumption patterns or income levels of the population as a whole.(61)) However, while Orshansky's poverty thresholds were not a purely absolute measure, they were also quite clearly not a purely relative measure, such as the 50-percent-of-median-income measure proposed by Britain's Peter Townsend in 1962 and (in the United States) by Victor Fuchs in 1965.(62)<p>The relativity is that the definitions assume that 1/3rd of income goes to food, which was the case in the 1950s. That is less now, while housing and transportation/energy costs are higher.<p>So okay, yes, there's some relativity in the definition, but it isn't by far a relative definition.",1316110442

(I'd argue that that development model's a poor fit for the web, but that's a different question.)<p><i>On Windows systems, the kerning is very odd in a lot of fonts since they moved to the new rendering engine a while back. The spacing following a capital T is usually way too tight, and in some fonts there are a few other examples as well. This can render pages completely illegible at typical body text sizes.</i><p>That is an artifact of ClearType subpixel positioning. Firefox 7 or 8 onwards (I don't remember which) turn subpixel positioning off for several commonly-used fonts, listed in gfx.font_rendering.cleartype_params.force_gdi_classic_for_families.<p><i>Also, take a Windows 7 computer with a few Adobe professional OpenType fonts installed locally -- probably some that come with Creative Suite would do -- and just try selecting those fonts using CSS in recent versions of Firefox.</i><p>I have a feeling you're choosing the font incorrectly. Note that with DirectWrite, any weight modifiers (""semibold"", ""black"", ""light"") aren't part of the font name any more. Instead you need to specify weight using the font-weight property. So instead of saying Arial Black as you would normally, you need to say Arial with weight 900: <a href=""http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/971376-firefox-displays-my-site-incorrectly-other-browsers-fine/page__p__593634608#entry593634608"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/971376-firefox-displays-my...</a><p>This is not a bug, though -- this is correct behaviour.<p><i>Most currently available web fonts also seem to look terrible (poorly hinted, terrible aliasing) on Windows XP in Firefox, but since they don't look great in other browsers either and they look better in Firefox on Windows 7, I'm inclined to point the finger more at Windows XP than Firefox in that case.</i><p>That's because most downloadable fonts aren't hinted for ClearType.

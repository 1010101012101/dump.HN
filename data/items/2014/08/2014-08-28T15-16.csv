The states cast their vote, balancing the equality of states vs population - ensuring both that one large state doesn&#x27;t get outvoted by a couple much smaller ones, and that one large state doesn&#x27;t render multiple small ones politically impotent. CA & NY have strong leanings toward urban political interests which conflict with legitimate interests of WY, MT, AK, etc ... but in a direct vote, the former would completely overwhelm the latter rendering their cumulative votes irrelevant. With electoral college, we have a &quot;progressive&quot; vote whereby neither the majority overwhelms the minority, nor the minority have an undue power over the majority - instead, we have a sensible balance.<p>Switch to direct election, and there will be no need for the various candidates to peddle their platform all over the country: candidates will focus on high-density population regions, ignoring &quot;flyover country&quot; entirely and unfairly biasing political power toward urban interests.",1409241494

Moreover, Russia openly admitting that it is invading a sovereign nation though it&#x27;s Kremlin-controlled media outlets (aka almost all media outlets in Russia) would mean trouble. So by Occam&#x27;s Razor, Putin is telling the media he controls to cover up as much of this as possible.<p>The EU rhetoric is a bit more nuanced, but probably comes from a similar place: if Russia is &quot;invading&quot; Ukraine, EU might be compelled to do something, which would put them in the precarious political and military position: the EU depends on Russian natural gas. Also Russia has nukes which makes opposing them militarily very dangerous (think, starting WWIII dangerous).<p>What evidence do you have that Russia is not in fact invading Ukraine?

Plenty of banks and established companies want to hire good engineers.  If the company you were with failed, it&#x27;s not simply because you were a poor engineer.\n  * &quot;it is much easier to go from Big Co to Small/Tiny Co, then the opposite&quot; - hyperbole.

So you&#x27;ll always need to search the full keyspace (e.g. 6-9 character length passwords).<p>The reason why MD5, 3DES, and similar algorithms aren&#x27;t really recommended in 2014 is that they&#x27;re very fast/efficient on modern hardware. This is due to utilising GPU cores to do the hashing (which wasn&#x27;t done back when MD5 was popular). This means the &quot;time to crack&quot; is low.<p>Here is benchmarks of different hashing algorithms (faster is WORSE):    \n<a href=""http://thepasswordproject.com/oclhashcat_benchmarking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thepasswordproject.com/oclhashcat_benchmarking</a><p>But the really nice part about things like BCrypt and PBKDF2(Rfc2898) is that they accept &quot;rounds.&quot; Which is number of repeated iterations over the password+salt. So every year you can respond to faster hardware by adding more rounds (e.g. 2014, have 10K rounds, in 2020 have 15K rounds, etc). If MD5 had supported rounds, it might still be safe to use today with enough iterations.<p>Even things like BCrypt and PBKDF2 will eventually fall by the wayside (MD5 used to be a more secure alternative to the much faster DES algorithm). But at least rounds (additional iterations to respond to changes in hardware) will keep them relevant for longer.",1409241115

A designer has a choice: they can make a very strong transform function, or they can make a very simple transform which is weak by itself, but strong when repeated. The latter approach dominates modern cipher design.<p>Modern ciphers execute the transform (the &quot;round function&quot;) many times. They take a key and expand it into subkeys, then use those subkeys with successive invocations of the round function, feeding the (gradually strengthening) ciphertext back through the cipher each time.<p>Curve25519 and ed25519 aren&#x27;t ciphers. They are two different ways to use elliptic curve math in cryptography; the former implements Diffie Hellman key agreement in the mathematical domain of a specific secure curve, and the latter implements public key signatures in that same domain. Neither mechanism is suitable for encrypting data; they&#x27;re used as tools to get two parties to agree to a cipher key to use to encrypt the actual data.<p>In TLS, for instance, Curve25519 might negotiate an ephemeral key between the server and the client (so that nothing would persist to disk that could be scooped up by NSA later and used to decrypt the session when it ends). Something like ed25519 could be used to sign the key exchange to make it impossible to MITM the session. The ephemeral key would get plugged into Salsa20, which would perform the actual encryption. It&#x27;s Salsa20 that has the round structure.<p>Salsa20 wants 20 rounds, but the last 8 of those rounds are for extra security; the author believes it to be secure at 12 rounds, and nobody has disproved that, or has any reason to believe he&#x27;s wrong. Salsa20 was designed for performance, and the cost of Salsa20 rounds is low, so 20 rounds was a pragmatic, cheap hardening mechanism.<p>On the other hand, the performance difference between reduced-round Salsa20 and real Salsa20 isn&#x27;t significant, so that was indeed a goofy choice† on their part. Salsa20 is very, very fast. Not to mention: bulk crypto in general --- AES in CTR mode, for instance --- is also very fast.<p>I&#x27;m not sticking up for this particular project; just reacting to the idea that NaCL would need to be rekeyed frequently.<p>† <i>(I&#x27;m taking it on faith that they actually are using Salsa20/12; I didn&#x27;t look carefully.)</i>",1409240822

8237668,comment,8237020,8237020,11,0,bane,,,"I bounce back and forth between startups (5), small companies (2) and mega corps (3) and so might some unique perspectives.<p>The truth is that for most of the world, bigco&#x27;s are the default and startups have to sell their employment in order to get employees. They have to find some way to offset the inherent employment instability that working for a startup entails. This has created many of the myths in this article that continue to be perpetuated.<p>Some observations:<p>Like a few other comments, I&#x27;ve noticed that the absolute best-of-the-best work for &quot;real companies&quot; and not startups. The reason working for a bigco doesn&#x27;t get the reputation of having the best engineering talent is simple, talent is like any other thing with a group of people, it follows a pyramid distribution. Most of the people are terrible and at the bottom of the pyramid, and as you move up the pyramid you end up with smaller and smaller populations of very good people. Except you can&#x27;t have fractions of a person, so in bigco, where the projects might involve 100 engineers. That top-notch engineer accounts for only 1% of the staff. Sure maybe 80% of the staff may not be any good, but that still leaves you with 20% who are <i>at least</i> decent work-a-day engineers.<p>In a startup, your entire engineering staff might be 10 people, and your top-notch engineer now accounts for 10% of all the staff time spent on a project. It&#x27;s almost like having 10 top engineers instead (if you try to scale the numbers to match). It&#x27;s easier to find 3-4 above average folks to round out the top of the pyramid  and the rest are just there to fill in the mortar and won&#x27;t last long.<p>This means that your individual contribution is magnified in a startup. <i>Everything</i> is magnified in a startup. Decision making power, individual contribution, etc. But so are negative aspects of working in a company. When things go bad, they go bad really fast in a startup. The worst political dramas I&#x27;ve ever seen were all in startups. Points of failure are enormous in small startups.<p>One of the thing that happens as companies mature and grow is they learn they can no longer tolerate so much magnified failure, so they build in controls to spread around responsibility so they can better survive what would be a catastrophic failure in a startup (founder leaving, tech decision turns out to be wrong 18 months in etc.).<p>The side effect is of course that in order to turn down this magnified negativity, the magnified good stuff also gets squashed.",1409239702

Furthermore, if they don&#x27;t get your decryption key, but they get your database dump -- they can then just brute your db and decrypt the passwords. They can do this because encryption is, by design, reversible. Encrypting passwords is almost as bad as storing in plain text.<p>Cryptographically hashing a password is the only way to go. When you cryptographically hash a password, using a known library that has been tested and written by actual cryptographers with passwords/authentication in mind (like bcrypt, etc -- no, sha&#x27;s and md5&#x27;s are <i>not</i> safe to use) - you get a one-direction algorithm in that a password goes in, is digested, and a fixed-length hash output comes out. There is no way to reverse this hash back into the original input. Adding salt(s) combats people making rainbow tables against your implementation, as they then would need to know not only which algorithm you are using, how many iterations it does, but also what your salt(s) are (sometimes even varied every so many iterations). This makes it almost impossible for someone to brute your leaked password database.",1409239034

8237598,comment,8236716,8236716,1,0,darklighter3,,,"Successful startups go through a couple of phases as they grow. At each phase the skills needed from the team will change because the challenges to get to the next level are different. And the team will often turn over along the way. Not everyone who was there in the beginning will be there at the end. And that&#x27;s okay. Now maybe you have the skills and experience to grow with the organization along the way or maybe you don&#x27;t. Lots of people maybe can and maybe can&#x27;t. Sometimes it depends upon where you are in your career. Was this your first time managing? Then maybe you need more experience and growth to be the CTO of such a large org. It can often feel like a demotion when you are passed over and senior positions are filled from the outside. I understand where you are coming from. I&#x27;ve been in your position.<p>Whether the CEO lied to you or not really depends upon context. When did he tell you this? Obviously things have changed as the company has grown. Perhaps he didn&#x27;t foresee the need for a CTO at the time but now he does. Things change and the needs of the company change with them. And remember he himself is growing and learning as a manager. If he was inexperienced he probably just couldn&#x27;t foresee the need. Also how realistic is it that a growing/successful technology company won&#x27;t have a CTO? I find it unusual that it took until ~450 people to get one.<p>Where do you go from here? If you&#x27;d like to be CTO (of your current company or another) the first step is an honest self assessment of the skills and experience you&#x27;ll need to attain and perform in the position. Second you&#x27;ll want to talk to the CEO about where you fit in to the company and your room for growth. You&#x27;ll need to convey your understanding of the need to bring in senior management but also convey that you feel that you can grow along with the org to accept more responsibility. See if you can lay out a plan to do that. If you don&#x27;t like what you hear coming out of that process then its time to start looking around.<p>Ben Horowitz has a really good blog post that touches on a lot of this stuff. <a href=""http://www.bhorowitz.com/demoting_a_loyal_friend"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bhorowitz.com/demoting_a_loyal_friend</a>",1409238994

8237595,comment,8237090,8237090,3,0,kator,,,"> 47 percent of the technology jobs in New York City no longer require any college education at all.<p>I&#x27;ve done a lot of hiring over the years and recently in NYC.  I can say in general I&#x27;ve always hired for Attitude and Aptitude.  I can teach you anything if you have the right Attitude.  I can&#x27;t teach you to have a good Attitude and I can&#x27;t make you have a better Aptitude.<p>One very real challenge in NYC is that big players are soaking up most of tech talent and there is a ground war between financial technology companies and other start-ups.  That pressure has caused companies to go back to the drawing board on how they qualify candidates.  For a while recruiters wouldn’t even look at a person without seeing some lofty education background in a resume.  Now they’re looking for the scrappy problem solver that might be savvy based on their recent work experience.<p>I find this interesting because when I started in technology 30 years ago I had a hard time hiring for my companies and developed this “Attitude+Aptitude” concept with my teams.  Over time it seemed like it was getting harder for people to get into technology jobs because it became accepted principle that you had to hire people with CS degrees to ensure success.  Of course that was BS when it happened and I’ve always fought against it over the years.  One of the best things for me about hiring in NYC was being able to tell the recruiting team what I was looking for and to tell them to stop looking for just CS degrees.<p>Recently I took a position as CTO in a San Francisco HQ’d start-up.  I’ve been talking to my engineering team on how we filter candidates, again I’m preaching A+A but its clear they’ve been taught to look for CS degrees and Math majors.  I’m working with them to broaden their thinking.  I think this is an example that in general people are lazy about hiring and they’ll use anything they can as an excuse to not invest in finding out if a candidate is the right person.  It’s tough, we’re all busy and have yet another meeting to run to or another customer call to deal with.  It’s easy to think hiring is a pain and distraction from what you’re doing today.  But, let’s be clear, the single most important thing you can do is scale your teams and if you don’t hire they’ll never scale and you’ll fail.  To me the most important thing you can do in a company is hire well.  The second most important thing is fire well, let people go if they’re not working out.  You’re not doing them any favors and in the end their life will be better if they can find a place they fit in and can be successful and your world will be more successful if you focus on building a team that is a well oiled machine that smashes through problems like a hot knife through butter.",1409238980

The parent was pointing out that suburban living requires a subsidy from elsewhere to support business as usual. This is more a question of equity than of someone imposing their will about some idealized way of living.<p>> I&#x27;ve yet to see someone make the point that there are solutions, such as using electric self-driving cars as public transport, will work. Assuming of course, the price can be made low enough.<p>First, transportation is relatively small potatoes compared to the costs of sewer and water systems. The marginal cost of bringing sewer and water to a suburban / exurban home tends to be quite a lot more than the average cost of supplying those services.<p>Second, I&#x27;m a huge proponent of self-driving cars, but they will not solve land use inefficiency. The biggest gains from self-driving cars will be from higher fleet utilization (think car share), and those gains will be best realized in higher density areas. If everyone in the suburbs still has their own car servicing their single-occupant commute, self driving cars really do nothing from an efficiency perspective.<p>> Maybe I&#x27;m a horrible human being, but I have a family, and I want space (incl. a garden), NOT living in a big city, and a car. I do not think this is too much to ask. Solutions (and politics) should focus on how to make that possible, not on how to prevent it.<p>Nobody has said this, and you&#x27;re lapsing into victimhood thinking. But here&#x27;s a couple of other things to keep in mind. First, the US didn&#x27;t really have a taste for suburbs the way we do now until WWII. And this was very much the result of government planners stepping in and telling people how they <i>should</i> live. We (planners) poured money into a freeway system that in many places primarily displaced minority and poor residents to ferry predominantly middle-class white people from new suburbs, through formerly integral neighborhoods, to central business districts. We (the country by way of our politicians) backed this up with home mortgage lending programs that basically required returning GIs to live a suburban lifestyle.<p>We already have a solution on how to make widespread suburban living possible--it requires money and energy, just like any other relatively inefficient system. I don&#x27;t think people who have a taste for it are bad people. However, neither do I think the societal benefits of suburban living are so intrinsically great that we should continue a wealth transfer. Put another way, the externalities of suburban living should be better internalized.<p>Finally, far be it for curmudgeonly me to suggest to anyone how to raise children, but I&#x27;ll just point out that the desire to isolate children from society in a suburban enclave is not a value universally shared throughout the world. Here are some young men describing their experiences growing up in the suburbs of Toronto: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYYdQB0mkEU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYYdQB0mkEU</a>",1409238279

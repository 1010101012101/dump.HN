GPAs usually don&#x27;t get revised and, when they do, it&#x27;s hard to revise them objectively, retracted disciplinary actions don&#x27;t give students their time back, and most people usually get exactly one chance at going through a stage of the educational system (especially the early ones).<p>This is <i>especially</i> scary and open to misinterpretation because, like anything that gathers only a small, well-defined subset of data (for privacy concerns, ironically!), it&#x27;s bound to paint an incomplete picture.

Plus the whole thing has to be rugged enough to survive the injection molding process which is no joke.<p>Worse is that even if the ENTIRE lo-jack is built into a single monolithic chip (which will take millions to engineer) you still have to power the thing.  The transistors might be getting exponentially cheaper but the batteries aren&#x27;t.

In order to make it easier for humans to know what host to communicate with, DNS records were created to be able to easily communicate with a particular host.<p>In addition to figuring out what host we want to communicate with we need a way to specify what application we want to use. So service names were created and assigned to a static list of application port numbers. Two of these application service names are &quot;http&quot; and &quot;https&quot;, which each provide a different application protocol.<p>We&#x27;ve built so many things that depend on these two application protocols that developers have finally outgrown what the protocols are capable of. But to get support for a new protocol is &quot;hard&quot;. You have to do three things to successfully roll out a new application protocol:<p>1. Write a server for it and make people want to use it, 2. Write a client for it and get users to want to use it, 3. Get network administrators to open up their firewalls to support it.<p>Sadly, many developers are playing a cat-and-mouse game with network administrators. They want their applications to be used by anyone, anywhere, automatically. So they employ tricks to get their content past network administrators, like re-using the same application service names used by protocols which are ubiquitously supported throughout worldwide networks.<p>But this just creates an arms race with network admins. For example, mandating strong encryption to use a service means a network admin traditionally can&#x27;t restrict what kind of applications work over it. So in order to fight their users subverting their approved applications policies, more and more organizations are doing SSL inspection by injecting CA certs into their employees&#x27; computers to block unauthorized applications.<p>Fighting network admins is a losing game, and does not benefit the users of your applications, or the developers. Instead of hiding more features and overlaying protocols, it would be more productive to create protocols that use their own service names and provide their own functionality and let users demand it be supported by the network admins. This is how all popular application services have been adopted over the years and provides the best quality of service to everyone involved.",1401133327

One of the issues here is that once a pallet enters the supply chain, who knows if or when you&#x27;ll get them back.  When I first started working for the grocery chain, there were over 30 pallets of back inventory sitting in the warehouse (this is a very bad thing and I corrected it during my time with the company).<p>The main problem with wooden pallets is that they are largely made with inferior wood that can&#x27;t stand up to the stresses applied to them for a long period of time.  If any of the center slats break, there&#x27;s no problem.  If one of the ends break, then you&#x27;re probably going to be cleaning up a warehouse floor from whatever was on the pallet.  People are also more likely to walk away with a wooden pallet since they have plenty of utility and are very inexpensive.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that plastic pallets are without fault, even if they are virtually indestructible.  Most plastic pallets are manufactured with a diamond plate pattern.  That&#x27;s nice and all, but it&#x27;s still plastic and therefore, slippery.  Place some frozen or refrigerated food on a pallet destined for a windy area and have fun cleaning bananas out of the back of the truck.<p>So the best of both worlds would be a plastic pallet with a non-slip coating on the top of the pallet and the feet.",1401132927

Personalization - Monitoring  reading habits will allow other software / professors to tailor material to individual student needs. Any slightly decent professor would presumably factor in exam results and not solely rely on this indicator.

They should already be covered under FERPA, perhaps that needs to be modernized to cover all cases (not just this one)?<p>2. Getting graduation rates up and students out in (close to) 4 years. If a student is getting bad grades on exams, and not reading (as this software might indicate) the professor can talk to the student and see if they really have the resources/time to successfully finish the class. If not, perhaps the seat can be opened up for another student.<p>It sounds harsh, but why should a student occupy a seat and then blow off the course?

There&#x27;s no need for plastic pallets, they could embed the RFID tags into each of the wooden blocks which make up the corners of the pallet. If one doesn&#x27;t already exist, it&#x27;s probably quite simple to produce a nailgun like device which literally shoots an RFID tag into a block of wood, which would make tagging existing pallets straightforward and cheap.<p>The palettes are cheap enough that they actually don&#x27;t need the exact location of each of them. All they need is the ability to track pallets at certain points in the supply chain, which will give them a good indication of global pallet movements.<p>RFID tag readers are also quite cheap so you could potentially fit a lot of them at relatively small expense.

Because of the compatibility break, the convention (and default for the Python build scripts) is to always name the Python 3 binary python3, so there should be no conflict. It&#x27;s understood that during the (very long) transition period there will be need to run both side by side.<p>A handful of ditros have gone ahead and named it python anyway. A stated motivation has been to encourage adoption of Python 3, but practically they&#x27;re just shooting themselves and their users in the foot, and ensuring incompatibility with the shebangs defined for every other OS. (I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any plan to ever switch the default binary name from python3 to python, so this incompatibility may never be resolved.)",1401131222

If you adopt a city plan full of cul-de-sacs and connect it with high-speed roads like a tree the traffic flows better (best game outcome), even though there are less roads and the individual&#x27;s commutes are longer.<p>SimCity is an interesting game to explore the concept of game theory since you don&#x27;t participate as an actor but rather as the rule maker.

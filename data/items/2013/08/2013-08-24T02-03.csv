Despite being a Microsoft tablet with a &quot;real&quot; copy of Office, it couldn&#x27;t join a domain and thus didn&#x27;t fit the most obvious business case.<p>I figured it was because they were copying the iPad model, which actually makes a ton of sense. If all the apps are locked down to their own little sandboxes, the support costs go <i>way</i> down and the machine becomes nearly trivial to administer. It reduces so many headaches, I think it really was a good win. They didn&#x27;t need to require signed stuff, but the sandbox model has been proven to work on the iPad.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think anyone would complain if it <i>looked</i> like an iPad. Having the Metro interface was all they needed. Instead they put the full Windows desktop on there because they weren&#x27;t far enough to replicate all functionality in Metro. I&#x27;d also guess that Office wasn&#x27;t ready for Metro.<p>So what you got, instead, was the equivalent of an iPad that looked like occasionally fell into OS X, but wouldn&#x27;t actually let you install any OS X programs.<p>Truth is, Apple was <i>very</i> smart to make iOS look completely different from OS X. Among other things, it gave them a clean break to change expectations of how computers work and how much control & administration the end user will do.<p>There were plenty of other bad decisions. I&#x27;d say the low end model (storage wise) probably should have just been cut so they didn&#x27;t end up with those &quot;I only get 4 gigs on my 32 gig tablet&quot; problems.

If screen diffing is how you want to test your program, you should use / write an independent program to do so.<p>That said, there are some serious problems to using screen diffing.  First, it requires manual testing.  You will need a pair of human eyes to determine if a change is breaking or not.  Second, there are a lot of false positives that make testing slow.  When a few pixels are moved on the page, is it okay?  Third, there&#x27;s a _LOT_ of data you will need to look at before you can be confident about the diffs.  You will need to do a screen shot for each page for each resolution for each git commit.<p>The signal to noise ratio is very low for screen diffing.

Python and Ruby have a large standard library and set of built-in functions, because they&#x27;re &quot;batteries included&quot; languages.  Lua is quite the opposite: it doesn&#x27;t even have access to the file system unless you implement that or use a module.  So you&#x27;d either end up using a limited Python without features absent in Lua, or you&#x27;d need to bridge the gap in functionality with a very large runtime library.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a more expressive syntax, check out MoonScript.

I have to assume that somebody got promoted because making VS 2012 look like the flavor of the day looked good on a review).<p>I was in Xbox, which had a /lot/ of very, very good people in the same review band that I was in.

6267357,comment,6266130,6266130,1,0,csandreasen,,,"To begin with, this article makes its argument that the NSA is involved with the Kim Dotcom situation based on two flawed arguments:<p>1) The use of the term &quot;selectors&quot; implies the use of PRISM because PRISM uses the term &quot;selectors&quot; for search criteria.  If you look at the other recent leaks, it shows that &quot;selectors&quot; is a generic term used across multiple tools by several, if not all, of five eyes intelligence agencies (try popping &quot;gcsb selectors&quot; or &quot;gchq selectors&quot; into Google).  It&#x27;s possible that they used PRISM or one of the other NSA tools, but they could very well have also used any of their own tools.<p>2) The phrase &quot;REL TO NZL, AUS, CAN, GBR, USA&quot; means &quot;related to fives eyes&quot;.  Google provides plenty of additional examples, but it seems that &quot;REL TO&quot; means /releasable to/, not /related to/.  In order words, personnel in the other intelligence agencies are allowed to see it; it doesn&#x27;t imply that they have worked on it.  See [1] for an example, but again, lots of other examples in Google.<p>The document says on page 13 that the FBI asked OFCANZ for assistance in carrying out an arrest warrant, OFCANZ then requested GCSB to &quot;gather intelligence&quot; on Kim Dotcom and his associates.  In addition, on page 4 it states &quot;No information concerning Mr. Dotcom or Mr. van der Kolk which GCSB obtained as a result has to date been shared with the Five Eyes.&quot;  The authors of the Ars article and the original article are both trying to make the point that the NSA is spying on Kim Dotcom, but there&#x27;s no mention of the NSA or that GCSB was using NSA tools anywhere in the leaked document.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m not sure who leaked these documents, but they didn&#x27;t bother redacting anything - there&#x27;s personal information all over the place.  I see names of the police staff, and (though they&#x27;re hard to read) the defendants&#x27; e-mail addresses, phone numbers, addresses, passport numbers, driver&#x27;s license numbers.

They felt this was a great system because a company with ~100K employees was bound to fit a bell curve regardless of its ability to hire and retain &quot;the best&quot;. They told me the five buckets only had to meet their expected quotas at the level of Steve Ballmer, so it absolutely was not a zero-sum game as some had alleged.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen a full year cycle applied to myself, but the one period I did participate in didn&#x27;t quite work that way in practice. In reality, the zero-sum gets enforced much lower in the company than Ballmer himself. Exactly where probably depends a lot on what division and team it is.<p>Neither have I seen evidence of the claimed worst effects of this type of system. Instead I saw great people take a hit for the team, rather than retaining underperformers for this purpose. Who knows, maybe in some ways this is just as bad.<p>Every big organization needs some kind of system and there are certainly worse ones. This system is effective in allowing the company to promote some people, keep some where they are, and move some out.<p>But it would be nice if the current shuffling at the top became an opportunity to bring in something better.",1377310375

One great benefit is regularly reading code written by developers with more experience than you.

I&#x27;ve looked into the RV lifestyle and I concluded that large class A motorhomes are pretty much limited to being semi-permanently parked in RV parks - with the occasional overnight at places like Wal-Mart when traveling.  The exception being in more rural areas where no one cares if you boondock.  However, don&#x27;t let the cheap price of this bus fool you - it would be an expensive lifestyle.<p>In the SF Bay Area, it will probably cost a minimum of $600 per month to rent a lot.  For about $200 more you could rent a room in an apartment with other housemates.  Getting further out of the metropolitan area (about a 3 hour drive) an RV lot is going to run in the range of $300 per month.<p>RV lots are a luxury, not necessarily a way to live cheaply.  For dirt cheap living, look into urban boondocking in a van or small RV or look at buying cheap rural land and parking something like this bus on it permanently (in impoverished parts of the country that setup could cost about $10,000).<p>This is a brilliant project - I really like the wide open feel - something you rarely see in a Class A motorhome (which is what this should be compared to).  However, you would need something stronger than translucent screens to make this a go.  You would need screen that block out all light and most heat flow.  Otherwise, this thing is going to be hell to heat or cool, but honestly, that&#x27;s a minor issue.  The translucent screens look nice, but I am betting something completely opaque would be more efficient and hence a lot more useful.

843500,comment,843094,843363,0,0,mahmud,,,"The advantage:<p>1) I can generate accessors, setters or getters automatically with just a keyword; :accessor, :reader, :writer.<p>2) DEFCLASS can be wrapped to provide further functionality with no change to the source code. For example, if I had wrapped defclass with a macro named defview, I could have the same exact code, but inherit from a serialized class or use a serialized metaclass. Both Postmodern and CLSQL ORMs will let me use a DB-CLASS or similar, and the class will map to a database table. All instantiated objects will be persisted to this table as records. Should I have gone the NoSQL route, I could persist to Redis, MongoDB, Berkeley DB or TokyoCabinet, with the <i>exact</i> same code.<p>3) Print object is a generic function of two arguments, class and stream. I can have as many of it, with the second argument specialized to various classes; TEXT-AREA, DIALOG-BOX, HTTP-STREAM, SHELL-BUFFER, FILE or whatever. The rendering will be different for each; my object would be rendered as a text in a buffer for TEXT-AREA, as editable GUI elements for DIALOG-BOX, as an HTML form for HTTP-STREAM, as plain text for the unix shell in SHELL-BUFFER, as a structured CSV/XML for FILE, etc. It's all up to me, all with no change in the code. To port from CLI to the web I would just have to write a series of ""backends"" and the logic stays the same.<p>4) INITIALIZE-INSTANCE is a standard generic function built into Lisp. The generic function dispatch is a bag of tricks all on its own. Right now I only wrapped the initialization protocol once, actually it's an :after method, which doesn't interrupt the initialization sequence but only does some post processing. There are also :before, and :around methods, which take place before the applicable method is called or instead of it, respectively. I could have as many of those as I want, with the most specialized ones being called first. The generic dispatch has further configurations;  I don't need to call the functions in this order, I could use a host of dispatch methods modeled after Lisp operators: PROGN dispatch would call all the applicable methods in sequence. OR would return the result of the first non-NIL method. AND would return a value of all applicable methods that don't return a non-NIL value. Others concatenate the result of applicable methods. CLOS is on a class of it's own.<p>5) I have used CHECK-TYPE and ERROR for error checking, both of which throw you in the debugger with several restarts as options. I could have used SIGNAL and started passing around some high-level conditions. Advanced control semantics the likes of which this side of call/cc has never seen.<p>6) I wrote a VALID-EMAIL-P predicate to validate email input. I could have written a generic function, VALID-INPUT-P which dispatches on the type of its arguments, and used regular expressions to validate my input. In my project, I don't even do input validation. The rules for valid input come from my users who know the application domain better than I. This is what makes a typical application more of a ""Business Rules Engine"". My boss has a table of all the types of data used in the system, including stuff I don't care about; EXPIRATION-DATE, for example, is a date input type with further constraints coming from several parts of my application, including billing. I could never foresee input validation like this, it would be a nightmare to hardcode this into the app, so I exported a web form where they can input business rules in plain English which gets compiled in to Lisp code (actually, so far it's a human compiler, moi, but I hope to develop this further into a DSL; I cheat and write regular expressions, along with some methods that query the various parts of the sytem, the exact regexes are used by the javascript client validation as well.)<p>I can look at a page of my code, and the are becomes a volume! I can see the screen of my laptop translate further back in to the horizon, on a negative Z-axis, giving that snippet of code of mine far more depth and weight than it would otherwise have in any other shallow language.

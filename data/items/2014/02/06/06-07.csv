They&#x27;re just selling raw feeds of data that people can pay for and analyse as they wish. This is something they definitely are doing, it&#x27;s called the &quot;Twitter Firehose&quot;, and isn&#x27;t cheap to get access to.<p>2. They&#x27;re selling their own, presumably anonymous, analysis of users for external advertising purposes. For example if I&#x27;ve tweeted about wanting to buy a car, maybe some car company&#x27;s agency wants to buy data that will allow them to (re)target me outside of Twitter - I put (re) in brackets as it&#x27;s the same concept as retargeting, but technically just targeting as I wouldn&#x27;t (necessarily) have already visited that car seller&#x27;s website. I&#x27;ve no idea if Twitter do anything like this, and I&#x27;m not entirely sure how it would work from a technical point of view, I&#x27;ve done marketing based around very targeted data, but only ever through companies that specialise on figuring out who to show adverts to, so I&#x27;ve never had to worry about how they were doing it.",1391669630

In our common-law system, laws are interpreted by the courts, over a long period of jurisprudence.  In the case of the Sherman Act, we have over a hundred years of case history to guide us.<p>The courts say that it must be an &quot;unreasonable&quot; restraint of trade.  After all, <i>every</i> contract is a restraint of trade!  If a grocery store signs a contract with a farm to buy all of their lettuce, then the grocery store isn&#x27;t going to the central produce market, where everyone has a chance to compete.  If Apple signs an agreement with Samsung to source its ARM CPUs, that means that Nvidia doesn&#x27;t get a chance to compete for the duration of the contract.<p>But that&#x27;s completely ridiculous, right?  They got the chance to compete <i>for</i> the contract.  And that&#x27;s exactly why it&#x27;s not an antitrust violation.  It&#x27;s a restraint of trade, but it&#x27;s very much reasonable.<p>Note that the word &quot;unreasonable&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually appear in the Sherman Act.

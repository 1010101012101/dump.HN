There are some strong statements, such as the last sentence: ""Because DNSCurve does not do this, and because the problems DNSCurve actually does solve are pretty well solved by UDP source port randomization and will be entirely eradicated by DNSSEC, ISC is not investing in DNSCurve at all.""<p>I have a few questions, in case anybody is interested in any of them:<p>1) Would full deployment of IPsec render DNSCurve unnecessary?<p>2) Isn't ""full security"" impossible until DNS queries are encrypted?

Even though I don't use it, iOS does the best job there. When you create a desktop shortcut for an app, it will get an icon that looks just like all other apps' icons, it will launch into a full-screen chromeless browser that you wouldn't know was a browser at all (with a loading image, even).  You can also control web apps that play HTML5 audio with the built in music controls from the multitasking pane.<p>Android has none of those things.  I've had hit or miss experience of it even picking a decent resolution icon, and Chrome uses the favicon with an envelope behind it, so it sticks out as a second class citizen (chrome also doesn't go chromeless).",1342738651

4268475,comment,4267946,4268381,1,0,napillo,,,"Nokia fragmented their own phone market with Meego and Maemo and S60/Symbian. If they went with Android, at the time they did - they would have been behind, because for a while Google didn't open the source to 2.x until they had their ""Nexus"" device out for a while. Android 1.x was not any better than Maemo or Symbian at that time,  so it would have been a lot of work for nothing. Not to mention that they would have further fragmented their market. Android 1.x was seen as slow and ugly, and it's future was far from clear. Maemo could run a lot of Linux software with just a recompile, so that was seen as a good thing instead of writing all new software. Nokia just didn't have enough programmers to write it all by themselves, and they released software once maybe twice a year if you were lucky. Nokia was a market leader for a long time with their candybar style phones that you could put different ""skins"" on. They always seemed to have great hardware, and decent software. However, they were late to the game with flip phones and lost market share to Motorola and RIM. Since then they were always trying to play catch-up but never succeeding.",1342738287

4268471,comment,4266983,4266983,36,0,michaelochurch,,,"Microsoft's review system sounds like an even more vicious variety of what Google has, which is more than bad enough to fell a great company.<p>Google has a bicameral system consisting of (a) manager-assigned ""calibration scores"" that are the outcome of stack-ranking nonsense and (b) annual peer reviews. It seems like a bicameral review system would be a <i>good</i> thing, by removing career SPOFs. If a bi- or multicameral system is well-designed, that's exactly what you get: multiple paths to success.<p>Where Google fails it is by making it an AND-gate rather than an OR-gate, even for lateral transfers, much less promotions. (Without good calibration scores, transfer is impossible.) At Google, people need managerial support AND peer support to advance, which means there's endless jockeying for visibility <i>in addition to</i> manager-as-SPOF. It really is the worst of both systems.<p>In a properly-run company, you have several review signals: peer review, extra-hierarchical work, demonstrated curiosity and will to self-improve, and managerial review. For firing (excluding people who do something outright wrong) the decision should be based an AND-gate. If someone does poorly by his manager AND can't get peer support AND can't find a transfer, then it's time to fire him. Not before. That's how <i>decent</i> companies do it. On the other hand, for title upgrades and pay raises and better projects, <i>decent</i> companies use an OR-gate. If he gets good managerial reviews OR good peer reviews OR has other managers interested in taking him, then treat the employee as successful: give him a decent raise and let him transfer as he wishes.<p>Now, managerial positions are a bit different. There, you actually want to see strength in several signals before you give someone power over other people. So there's justification for making selection <i>into management</i> be based on an AND-gate. You just really need to be sure that the person can lead. That's different. But title upgrades, pay raises, project allocation, autonomy and transfer opportunities should be based on an OR-gate; if one signal indicates potential for success, move forward. If you can't see this, then you're FAL and you should not be allowed to leave the house without assistance, much less make decisions that affect other people.<p>Google fucked up its bicameral system by making it an AND-gate for promotions and transfers and an OR-gate for adversity. That's the destruction of what was once a great company. It has cost the software industry billions of dollars worth of value. It sounds like a similar billion-dollar immolation occurred at Microsoft.<p>Microsoft's system, advanced half a decade or more further in necrosis, seems much the same but worse. It seems like these types of systems get worse over time because more people want to tack on their own shitty ideas as more people develop the system. They're not happy enough with other peoples' pre-existing shitty ideas; they need to make a personal mark on a shitty system by making it noticeably shittier, enough that they hear people complaining about their changes in the cafeteria (which they justify as a good thing because ""those people are obviously no good, because good people have nothing to worry about come review time."")<p>I am glad the Vanity Fair article got published. I have no strong feeling about Microsoft either way, and I have a lot of respect for the great work coming out of Microsoft Research, but it's about time that we see bad HR policies leading to outright exposure and frank humiliation.",1342738184

4268468,comment,4267658,4267867,2,0,rcthompson,,,"I assume that one major difference is that the web apps are treated as separate applications from the main browser, so they get put in their own icon on the Unity side bar, which gives them their own keyboard shortcuts and the ability to pull up just the windows related to a single webapp. For example, maybe Super+5 would be the shortcut to either activate your existing Twitter webapp window or open it if it isn't already running, regardless of whether your regular browser happens to be running or not at the time.<p>If you just had multiple browser windows open, they would all be together on the Firefox (or Chrome) icon and it would be difficult to distinguish them.

Fast forward a few years, and not only is Intel still the dominate player in the market, but their lead in process technology makes it extremely difficult if not impossible for anyone else to compete. For example, Ivy Bridge has a slightly higher transistor count than AMD's Bulldozer, but has a die roughly half the size of the AMD part.[1] That means that even if AMD was producing a part that performs competitively with Intel, they're going to have difficulty competing with them on price since Intel can crank out more dies per wafer.<p>Obviously it's entirely speculative whether AMD would have been able to capitalize on increased market share and keep up with Intel long term but Intel doesn't really <i>need</i> to manipulate the market like they used to anymore since they've managed to put themselves in such a comfortably entrenched position.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/5771/the-intel-ivy-bridge-core-i7-3770k-review/3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/5771/the-intel-ivy-bridge-core...</a>",1342737667

It's hard to say for sure, but I'm not sure I would. This makes committing $50 to something that may not work out difficult  I need to be convinced of the value of this project.<p>The second big question is: Would everyone else pay $50/year for Twitter?

The last set of tests I ran the direct ORM overhead consisted of between 0.2% and 2.3% of our page load times so we promptly focused on things that actually mattered  (mostly JS).  The ORM advantage is mostly in being able to get a demo to work quickly vs. spending less time optimizing complex queries, which means you only really spend time looking at the slowest stuff which can warp how you look at things.<p>PS: If you have demo's that EF adds linear overhead feel free to show it but I have pulled 1,000 rows in under 1 second so I suspect your have messed up your setup somewhere.",1342735220

Your job is to mine feedback for useful and relevant information. Whether the feedback is negative or positive is irrelevant. Criticism can contain a kernel of truth - it can point to a market weakness or an unfounded assumption. Praise can be very dangerous - socially, it's much easier to offer simple-minded positive re-enforcement to an entrepreneur and send them on their way.<p>I'd rather have 10 sneering, withering, and informative criticisms over a single fawning, ego-boosting, yet empty congratulation.",1342735216

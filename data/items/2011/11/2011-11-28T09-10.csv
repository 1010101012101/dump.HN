This article however, seems a little bit <i>too</i> excited about jumping into html5 and a little too quick to dismiss the techniques about the past. In the process it makes a few mistakes.<p>A good example would be the <meter> element which the spec specifically states:<p><i>The meter element also does not represent a scalar value of arbitrary range  for example, it would be wrong to use this to report a weight, or height, unless there is a known maximum value.</i><p><a href=""http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-meter-element"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-meter-element</a><p>This code is certainly not ""bad code"":<p><pre><code>    <section>
    My height is 5 feet and 10 inches.
    </section>
</code></pre>
That's perfectly acceptable.<p>I think marking up your height and weight and calling it <i>better</i> is dubious. Some would argue that the meter element itself is a bit dubious. I'm still not sure how I feel about it. A lot of the html5 elements are quite nice but you shouldn't go changing everything over just because it's new.",1322474229

3285245,comment,3282447,3282656,1,0,exDM69,,,"The choice of language is not so important here, but the choice of a language implementation is. If you're doing a lot of network I/O in parallel, you need a language and a framework that can take advantage of hardware concurrency (multiple threads and/or processes), but should be able to do fast switches between your tasks (not requiring a full OS supported context switch, which is slow).<p>This pretty much rules out e.g. Python and Ruby, because the CPython/CRuby interpreters suck at concurrency (there are other implementations available, which are a little better). You can still do many Python processes, which do lightweight switching between I/O tasks somehow (e.g. with Twisted), but then load balancing between processes becomes a PITA. Node.js is similar, there's only one thread running at once. With Node.js (and twisted) you also have to manually ""compile"" your code for asynchronous style continuation passing style, something humans suck at but compilers do very well.<p>Now given the task you said, you could take C and epoll/kqueue and write a small framework yourself, but processing the data you got with C might not be too nice.<p>Or you could use an interpreter or a compiler that does this automatically for you. This is where the choice of language kicks in. In order for the language implementation to be able to effectively organize parallel execution, it needs some information from the language. C doesn't have any helpful information, which is why it often relies on full OS context switches where all machine state is stored and restored (or a non-portable hack with the stack). Something lisp-y with first class continuations might be helpful, but many lisp implementations don't really do concurrent execution well.<p>So, for a language that concurrently executes network I/O efficiently while still being high level and fast, my recommendation for your task would be: Haskell. There's years of research and engineering work done on just what you're looking for in Haskell. Just forkIO as much as you wish, write your code in regular sequential imperative style, compile for multithreaded execution (ghci --threaded) and let the compiler and runtime do all the hard work for you.<p>Erlang might do the job too. If anyone knows of other languages with smart I/O multiplexing and co-operative userland threads or fibers (with concurrent execution!), please reply here!<p>NOTE: my assumption was that you're actually processing the data you're receiving and you're more or less CPU limited. If you're I/O bound, you don't necessarily need concurrent execution and may get away with Twisted or Ruby fibers or Node.js (without using multiple processes and load balancing or task queues).",1322472947

It was the next logical step for me as I was learning to program. Lisp and Haskell are the two of the big scary functional (though not purely functional in the case of Lisp) languages. They both warrant knowing.<p>Furthermore, I'd probably disagree with the assertion that Haskell is more powerful once fully grasped. Lisp gives a lot of power to programmers (exhibit 1: the Lisp macro system). However, that means molding the definition of 'power' to suit my needs, and I don't really want to go there. I think that Haskell and Clojure are both very powerful and amazing languages. They are not mutually exclusive. I just happen to like Clojure more. Plenty of people go the other way. I, of course, still have a lot of respect and love for Haskell and hope to have time to do more with it in the near future.<p>As for why I switched in the first place, I guess it was mostly because Clojure looked like it would be so much fun. When you're young, what others perceive as weirdness can sometimes be exactly the thing that appeals to you. The reaction I had to parentheses is exactly the opposite of what experienced developers tend to have in the beginning. I <i>loved</i> them.",1322471930

IKEA has to spend the R&D for developing furniture for their other markets anyway.  So just ship the most radical and funky looking stuff to China (which would be mostly pointless to copy anyway) and set up a different lunch bar every 20m or so.<p>They could offer all the cuisines of northern Europe, seeing that the average Chinese person doesn't ever gets to travel and would've never gotten to taste any of it.

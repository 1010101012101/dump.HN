3291229,comment,3289750,3290660,8,0,sunahsuh,,,"It's not an easy fix, but there's been a lot of scholarly work that points to some of the ""societal beliefs"" you talk about reverse engineering (grad school protip: that reverse engineering is called ""deconstructionism"" and there's an entire discipline called ""gender and women studies"" that delves into it ;)). I haven't scanned all the comments yet but I suspect a good number of them call for things like ""education"" or ""coaching"" on negotiation -- basically, that ""women should ask for more"". The thing these solutions overlook is that the root of the problem is socialized, enforced gender roles and there are serious social consequences for women who overstep these boundaries.<p>An interesting recent study study studied the behavior of women when negotiating for themselves vs negotiating for others. When negotiating for themselves, they exhibited the kinds of behavior in the original link, ending up with salaries far below the men in the study. When they were asked to negotiate for someone else, however, they performed on par with the men. (link: <a href=""http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/news/item/7223326/Role+of+Gender+in+Workplace+Negotiations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/news/item/7223326/Role+of+Gende...</a>, original: <a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/98/2/256/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/98/2/256/</a>) And you know that oft-cited study that men think about sex way more than women? Well, they also think about sleep and food at about the same rate.. and way more than women. One way to interpret these results is that women are socialized to think less of their own needs (and to voice them less) -- and this is a societal norm that's heavily enforced with consequences for those who don't toe the line.<p>Think about how strong women are regarded vs men who exhibit the same behavior. A woman that does what she needs to get what she deserves runs the risk of being called a ""bitch"" or, at the very least, being thought of as unfeminine. Personally, I find fucking with gender norms an amusing hobby so I don't give a shit about the consequences.. but a lot of women aren't into that ;) Just remember this when thinking about possible solutions -- the root causes are way deeper than the appallingly patronizing ""women need to be taught how to negotiate.""",1322588189

What I'm saying is that it's useless to have totally generalized abstractions (outside of pure math) since more often than not, they are so far removed from reality that most people can no longer make any connection to use cases.<p>My entire argument is that there's a heavy communication failure between mathematicians and scientists of every other field where math is used as a tool. Sure, it's convenient for a mathematicians to be able to use shorthand gibberish to talk to other mathematicians. It doesn't justify pushing this jargon on other fields.<p>Besides which, convenience is no excuse for making something hard to understand. Sure it's convenient to name all your variables in a program a, b, c etc but you're going to get lynched by any programmer that tries to read your code later, including yourself.<p>When it comes to a point where gibberish becomes the <i>only</i> way to explain mathematical abstractions, then you should step back and ask yourself ""where the hell did this go wrong?"".<p><i>>This isn't just a problem within mathematics. For a simple programming example:[...]</i><p>I believe in giving simple explanations and expanding them whenever there's a loophole that needs to be fixed. You don't make programs that cover every single niche use case, either (if you don't have to, that is). That's the problem with math - the generalizations, while useful in math itself, are sheer overkill in many situations outside of math.<p>Lastly, sorry taking this out of order, but:<p><i>>An isolated concept is worthless.</i><p>So is a generalized abstraction without any context. I'm saying that the sweet spot is somewhere in between for most people to understand and apply concepts, and that it's better to generalize upwards from reality and actual use cases instead of starting utterly removed from reality and trying to apply the generalizations downwards.",1322587837

Tell the audience the number of children you have, the chosen child's gender, and the day of the week on which it was born.""<p>Case #2: A father is chosen at random from all fathers who have two children, including one boy born on a Tuesday. He is also ushered onto a stage and given a slip of paper that instructs him to tell the audience the criteria used to select him.<p>Now shift scenes. You are in the audience when a man is ushered onto the stage. He looks at a slip of paper, thinks a moment, and says ""I have two children and one of them is a boy born on Tuesday."" What is the probability that he has two boys?<p>The answer to the question depends on which case applies to the man you listened to. In Case #1, it is 1/2. In case #2, it is 13/27. Your simulation only covered the second case. To get the first, after you have two children, flip a coin to see which one the father will tell about. If it is not a Tuesday Boy, dont keep that trial even if the other child is a Tuesday Boy. You will find that the 27 cases where you have a Tuesday Boy reduce to 14 (just over half, since one father didnt need to flip the coin), the 13 where you also have two boys reduces to 7, and the answer is exactly 1/2.<p>If you simulate the simpler problem, where you dont worry about the day of the week, the answers are 1/2 and 1/3 for the two cases, respectively. The reason 13/27 seems unintuitive, is because the fact that a Tuesday Boy was REQUIRED in the second case is not intuitively obvious from the statement ""one of them is a boy born on Tuesday."" In fact, as you point out, the puzzle could equally well be named after either of your two children, which is probably two different names. You choose one, just like the father in case #1, so the better answer to your question is 1/2, not 13/27. It is still ambiguous, but there is no valid reason to assume that case #2 applies.",1322587015
3291136,comment,3290429,3290429,16,0,dewitt,,,"One of the things that we've been emphasizing at Google of late is to ensure that each API has a sustainable model prior to launching it.<p>By that I mean, evaluating each new surface to verify that it provides value to all parties  the end users, the developers, and to Google (in roughly that order, but all are essential)  and that this value scales as the popularity of an API or platform increases.<p>Over past years, we've launched a handful of APIs that perhaps met one or two of those criteria, but not all, and learned through practice that we're unlikely to achieve a sustainable ecosystem without first identifying a ""virtuous cycle"" such that success for each party is complementary to the others.<p>Nothing pains me more than seeing an API surface go away, so we've been working at getting consistently better at making sure each new launch has strong potential for longevity.  Launching a new surface just because it's interesting (or to find out if it's even possible) is obviously tempting, and can be fun and even rewarding in the short-term, but each new API is also a promise being made to developers, and that promise is a commitment not to be taken lightly.<p>Now sometimes, the underlying products go away for good reasons, and we need to turn down the corresponding API surface (e.g., when the Buzz API was shut off when Buzz was sunsetted in favor of Google+), sometimes we grossly underestimated the potential for abuse (e.g., the old translate API, the first version of which didn't have quotas or require any real form of registration), sometimes we were able to declare victory and move on (e.g., Gears -> HTML5), and sometimes API functionality was never officially available to begin with, and as such when the underlying product changes and it's impossible to keep the unofficial surfaces intact (e.g., Reader), but in every case the decision to turn one of these down is a difficult one.  Whenever possible we've gone through great lengths to keep the surfaces stable and available as long as practical to give developers time to find new solutions (6 months to a full 3 years is the norm).<p>Going forward, I think the additional up-front discipline is a win for all of us.  It's a bit more work on our side to play out all of the possible scenarios (what if no one uses it?  what if <i>everyone</i> uses it?  what if our fiercest competitors start using it?), but in doing so I have even more confidence that when we launch new platforms we're going to be able to stand by them for the years ahead.<p>Personally I'd still bet (heavily) on third-party services, both from big established companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc., and also on smaller and upcoming startups.  Though I'd certainly ask myself the question: is there the virtuous cycle in the API that I depend on?  Can the service provider reasonably sustain it for the long-haul?  Does the API provider benefit when my usage increases?  Do <i>I</i> benefit if my own user numbers grow?  Etc.  Contingency plans are still a must  betting your entire company on getting something free from someone else forever is probably a bad bet  but I'm bullish on the future of web services in general, and plan to personally stay in this space for a long time to come.<p>Some day I should give a talk on lessons learned the hard way...",1322587002

3291084,comment,3288388,3290236,5,0,wbhart,,,"Sorry, I got confused there for a minute. The answer is in fact just ""yes"". I'm not sure why this was voted down.<p>The reason is that the border rank of 2x2 matrix multiplication is seven. This was proved 5 years ago by Landsberg, though it took quite some effort for me to track this down. Sometimes ""yes"" is the best one can do at short notice. Perhaps individuals who enjoy taking points away from people might consider this!<p>However, Winograd's algorithm can do nxn matrix multiplication with n^3/2 + 2n^2 multiplications (and many more additions than usual). This is only useful if the coefficients are <i>very</i> large because of the cost of the extra additions. Moreover, this is not a block algorithm, i.e. it cannot be applied recursively. Anyhow, for 2x2 matrices, n = 2 and so the total number of multiplications is 2^3/2 + 2n^2 = 12 which is more than the usual 8 multiplications (or 7 if you use Strassen). Similarly for n = 3 it is less efficient than the naive 27 multiplications (and even less efficient than Lederman's algorithm: 23 multiplications and Bard's algorithm: 22 multiplications), but for n = 4 we get 4^3/2 + 2x4^2 = 64 which is the same as the naive algorithm and for n = 6 we get 6^3/2 + 2x6^2 = 180 which is well under the usual 216 multiplications required by the naive algorithm and even less than the number of multiplications required if you use one level of Strassen. Already by n = 8 Strassen is better if you go by the number of multiplications alone. Of course in practice the coefficients need to be really large (perhaps tens of machine words) before either Winograd or Strassen are better than the naive algorithm.<p>Note that if you break a larger matrix up into 2x2, i.e. 4 blocks then the smaller submatrices no longer commute (matrix multiplication is not commutative). This is why Winograd's algorithm is not a block algorithm like the Strassen method.",1322586246

They are intimidated by computers.  They want a device that will let them Facebook, and surf the web, and watch content without the hassle of setting anything up or making decisions about how the device should function.  These people don't want to write in Word on a piece of glass.  They want to hit a button and go without the hassles of program errors and blue screens.  In other words, they don't want Windows.",1322586096

There's nothing better than hashmaps for exploratory programming. If there is something to be gained from building a Lisp in terms of them (from the ground up; I don't mean support for object literals), I'd like to know what it is.

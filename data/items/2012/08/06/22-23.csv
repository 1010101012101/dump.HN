One of the great parts of the internet is the way it seems to lower the barrier of entry for just about everything.  If this app can help people learn how to do simple statistical analysis, there just might be a load of value there.  I didn't really click around, but something they might think about doing is allowing users to hyperlink directly to an ""analysis session"" so a blogger can not only link to a graph, but the data itself.  I can imagine a scenario where a blogger writes a post about maybe housing prices, and draws some unreasonable conclusion.  Then a reader goes, and adds in inflation data which changes the story.  He then replies in the comments with a link to his new ""analysis session"" spurring a new conversation.<p>Its probably taking the tool to a different direction, but i really like what's here.",1344293906

Chinese moms are deeply invested in their children's education, and no doubt they judge themselves (and each other) by how much their children have achieved.<p>The sad thing is that some of those women may actually have been unimpressed by a Berkeley grad. You no doubt are aware of the tutoring centers that dot the Valley, catering to Asian students and their demanding parental units. Besides AP and SAT prep, some of these places also offer ""college counseling"" that runs many thousands of dollars over several years.<p>My sister, who is quite a bit younger than me, is on the verge of applying to college.

The question of morality require more than the simple fact that someone can gain something of value without loosing something of value in exchange.<p>A question asked by Eben Moglen (a professor in law historian and founder of FSLC), if bread could be copied with no costs by the process of pressing a button, what would the argument be to require more for bread than what a starving person would be able to pay? Would it be morally right to deprive a person of what he or she need to live when it cost you nothing to allow the person to survive? And if you do decide to deprive the person of that bread in a effort to give money for the first bread created, would the death of the starving man then be murder?<p>And before you say ""but copyrighted works are not necessary for living"", please consider the effect of education has on a person ability to survive.

Since, judging by mthoms's post, this seems to be a tradition at Olympics, my reasoning may be off, but I imagine that forcing all vendors to only accept Visa must cost a <i></i>lot<i></i> more than a sponsorship without that conditionand I really think that they wouldn't blindly jump into that without a sound reason.<p>There's the obvious trade-off of how much extra money Visa makes from users who have multiple cards and are forced into using Visa where they wouldn't have otherwise vs. money lost from Visa-owners who who are pissed off. But there are probably much more subtle, long-term effects. Maybe 75% of consumers present have a Visa, and 50% of those Visa-owners feel entitled and empowered by having the ability to use their card while others are frustrated; and then there's the trade-off of the 'entitled' Visa-owning 37.5% of consumers spending more with their Visa cards over the following months/years vs. the money lost due to the 25% of consumers who didn't have a Visa at the olympics and possibly hold a grudge and never own a Visa card because of the experience. Not to mention the fact that a similar sponsorship would likely be arranged if Visa decided not to do it; for all we know, MasterCard had a clear business incentive to do this but refrained because of moral reasons, but are we (consumers as a whole) discussing how valiant MasterCard is and how much they respect us as consumers or have we all forgotten a little bit about MasterCard because everyone's talking about Visa?<p>Again, I don't agree with this idea; I think it's bad and annoying. But I think it's silly and a bit ignorant for all of us (many of whom have no marketing experience, and most of whom don't on this scale) to assume we know more than the marketers making these decisions because we're annoyed.",1344292511

This means for a little TCP-IP server, you use one erlang-process per incoming connection on one core or 32 -- the only difference is how they are schedule, when you are on 32 cores the Erlang VM starts up more threads and then schedules the erlang-processes across the VM threads and those threads are scheduled across physical processors.<p>The trick is -- when you build software in Erlang -- you start up new processes for the true concurrency (in a web application, the true concurrency is number of connections, so they get there own processes).

No, they argue that humans are animals, not beasts. The terms mean different things: ""frogs are animals"" is true and ""frogs are beasts"" is false. Further, the claim that humans are animals is true by definition. The technical definition is complex, but it should suffice for anyone versed in biology to know that humans are living organisms with nervous systems and that all such organisms belong to the kingdom Animalia, which means that humans are animals.<p>Then they follow the strawmen with pomposity, such as ""it would take more time and space than I have here to refute these views."" How would the author know how much time and space it would take to refute them? He presumes that such a refutation not only exists, but that he knows it. This presumption is preposterous because there cannot be a refutation of them. You cannot refute linguistic arguments without proving that there is a One True Definition for a given word or phrase, which would require proving that some form of Linguistic (non-mathematical) Platonism is true, and that has yet to pass the threshold of being a coherent concept.<p>Then they rewrite to shroud their pomposity with an excuse, such as ""while [insert previous quote], I'd like to suggest...""<p>Ugh.",1344290822

I know that it was a popular topic in general at the FSW-11 conference.<p>Simulink is a possibility. It's a MATLAB component popular among mechanical engineers, and therefore most navigation & control engineers, and allows them to 'code' and simulate things without thinking they're coding.<p>Model-based programming is definitely a thing that the industry is slowly becoming aware of, but I don't know how well it's catching on at JPL or if they would have chosen to use it when the project started.<p>The third and most likely possibility is for the communication code. With all space systems, you need to send commands to the flight software from the ground software, and receive telemetry from the flight software and process it with the ground software. Each command/telemetry packet is a heterogeneous data structure, and is is necessary that both sides are working from the exact same packet definition, and format the packet so it is correctly formatted on the one side, and parsed on the other side. This involves getting a whole lot of things right, including data type, size, and endianness (although the latter is usually a global thing, you could have multiple processors onboard with different endianness).<p>But that's just the surface. You need lots of repetitive code on both sides to handle things like logging, command/telemetry validation, limit checking, and error handling. And then you can do more sophisticated things. Say you have a command to set a hardware register value, and that value is sent back in telemetry in a particular packet. You could generate ground software that monitors that telemetry point to ensure that when this register value is set, eventually the telemetry changes to reflect the change. And of course, some telemetry points are more important than others (e.g. main bus current), and are designated to come down in multiple packets, which involves extra copying on the flight side and data de-duplication on the ground side.<p>With all that, it's much easier (in my opinion) to write one collection of static text files (in XML, csv, or some DSL/what-have-you), run them through a perl/python script, and presto!

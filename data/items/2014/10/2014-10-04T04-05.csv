8408806,comment,8406358,8407847,3,0,fizixer,,,"- You&#x27;re citing a document from 2010, when IBM Watson hadn&#x27;t beaten humans on Jeopardy, Google driverless car wasn&#x27;t demonstrated, Boston Dynamics big-dog, atlas hadn&#x27;t happened, DARPA robotics competition hadn&#x27;t happened, quadrocopters weren&#x27;t doing crazy things, Amazon kiva systems, Baxter, etc, etc. Things are picking up pace. (EDIT: hadn&#x27;t happened or not widely known).<p>- Since then, Paul Krugman himself has covered tech-unemployment in at least one of his blog posts, in which he has expressed surprise at how things are changing but has concluded the post in humor and essentially dismissing the idea (not very wise!).<p>- Politicians lag behind economists in staying up to date, who themselves lag behind technologists. &quot;This time&quot; it would really help if economists try to wake up.<p>- CGPGrey&#x27;s youtube video &#x27;Humans need not apply&#x27; is a must watch for anyone serious about staying aware of upcoming technology.<p>- The accusation of lump-of-labor fallacy is itself a strawman fallacy. Tech-unemployment doesn&#x27;t require labor to be fixed. It can happen even if labor lump is increasing but not as fast as humans are becoming obsolete, i.e., &quot;this time&quot;.<p>- Side-comment: Adaptation almost always happens because of new-entrants (youth learning new trades) so it&#x27;s a generational thing. Those thrown out of the job market are more likely to retire early or something like that. And &quot;this time&quot;, even youth are not going to adapt.<p>- Side-comment 2: Recessions cause quite a bit of damage to social structures which intentionally or unintentionally doesn&#x27;t get media coverage, or at least doesn&#x27;t register in public&#x27;s minds. Just the recent European recession caused suicide in the millions (I came across this article recently but can&#x27;t find it ATM).<p>- I&#x27;ve put &quot;this time&quot; multiple times. I have to admit it&#x27;s a claim without scientific evidence, but circumstantial evidence combined with conversation with technologists who agree what is possible in principle, really is a strong indication. Brain emulation has nowhere to go but in the direction of &quot;a solved problem&quot;. The estimated time frame is 10 to 15 years.",1412398670

That means the actual content of the web (HTML pages) should not require revision to support the wire  protocol upgrade, especially considering HTTP has an upgrade mechanism already built in.<p>There&#x27;s almost no benefit that I can see to require a new scheme, and tremendous downside.<p>> That first part, before the colon, is a protocol descriptor. It would be perfectly reasonable to change the protocol descriptor.<p>Actually, if you look at the specs, the first part is a scheme identifier, not a protocol identifier.  There&#x27;s a big difference.   Schemes point you here:  <a href=""http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtm...</a><p>And then you look up the spec for how to interpret and/or resolve the rest of the URI.   That may or may not involve a mapping to a wire protocol (e.g. the &quot;about&quot; scheme, or the &quot;geo&quot; scheme).",1412398611

A payload moving up the elevator does pull on the cable, tending to slow it down. The cable, however, being massive and under very high tension, pulls back, accelerating the payload.<p>If the cable is not anchored to the Earth, this causes the cable to slow down, and wobble a bit since the force is applied sequentially along the cable&#x27;s length, rather than always on the center of mass, though tidal effects will tend to damp the wobble and keep it oriented practically straight up and down. For any one payload, the effect is negligible, as a space elevator cable would be freakin&#x27; massive, but without some sort of active stationkeeping it would eventually come down.<p>If the cable is anchored to the Earth, however, as soon as it begins to be pulled over even a little bit by the rising payload, the lateral force is transmitted to the ground. The cable pulls on the Earth and the Earth pulls back, re-accelerating the cable with no need for active stationkeeping and ever so slightly slowing the rotation of the Earth. Since the Earth is Gigantic and has ridiculously large quantities of angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy, no one will ever notice this loss in practice.",1412398300

The geofence (as implemented in ArduPilot) is simply a safety measure; once the aircraft passes outside of a defined zone, it returns to a pre-determined waypoint inside the fence and waits for further pilot commands.<p>To answer the initial question, the latest versions of ArduPilot implement terrain following (based on terrain data loaded into the flight computer before-hand). Additionally, there is also now support for range-finding instruments like Lidar Lite [0], although I don&#x27;t believe those are currently being used in the terrain following mode. Such instruments could conceivably be used to implement &quot;look-ahead&quot; functionality to more accurately avoid obstacles.<p>[0] <a href=""https://store.3drobotics.com/products/lidar-lite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://store.3drobotics.com/products/lidar-lite</a>",1412396009

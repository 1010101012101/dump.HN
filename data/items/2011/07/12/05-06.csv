Whether or not the time I was spending piecing together my feedback was worth it or not.<p>Because I know the ""Send feedback"" button is there for a reason, I ignored the conflict I was going through and submitted my opinion on principal anyway. Regardless of this fact, I'm _still_ questioning whether or not what I just submitted was worth the time I spent putting it together.<p>So, I've come to the ever-intelligent members of HN to ask the question, ""When does user-submitted feedback matter?"" I would like to think that user-submitted feedback is handled democratically, wherein the majority rules and once a specific number of people have weighed in on a specific thing, action is taken.<p>But, honestly, I can only see user-submitted feedback being handled democratically if the feedback is inherently negative, i.e a bug that completely decimates the user-experience in it's entirety, rather than feedback that is inherently positive, i.e a feature request.<p>That said, although I ended up submitting my feedback to Google for a feature I think would add positively to the user-experience of Google+, taken what I've said above, I'm almost positive it's a textbook example of grasping at straws.<p>So, what do you guys and gals think?

2753663,comment,2753543,2753614,1,0,abduhl,,,"1. I think Google's ultimate goal is to bring you into an environment where you are just ""Googling"".  This is evidenced by the top bar whenever you are on a Google site.  They aren't trying to make it so that you are actively participating in a social media site like when you are facebooking, they are trying to make your entire presence on the net a social experience.  There is no need for you to be ""plusing"" as you will be ""plusing"" simply by being online. No longer do you need to have a tab left open for your Facebook, your social media experience is fulfilled by leaving your email open.<p>2. One interesting counterpoint to this is how Google+ is growing. Certainly there are some people coming from websites/forums asking for invites but I would bet money that at least as many are coming from people posting on facebooks themselves. Facebook's own established network is working against them here.<p>The privacy debate is really not that important in the end. People who care about the privacy will end up posting on their facebook and inviting their friends to try Google+ (which they most likely will, it's a Google product afterall) and once they are on Google+ they will either like it more than facebook or they won't (because we have already established they don't care about the privacy aspects). In the end it comes down to which one can provide a better experience for most users and Google+ once again has the lead here because of how it can insert itself into your entire online experience.",1310448856

Myspace was popular in the era where social networking was for teens and ""<i>nerds</i>"", Facebook rose to popularity when social networking was for everyone, google plus can't just waltz in and take all those users.

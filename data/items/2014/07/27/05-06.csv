Like if your phone reported that it&#x27;s got the same signal strength for BP and PH it will estimate that you are in between them with other access points helping to conclude that you aren&#x27;t off to the side otherwise the signal strength to xyz access point would be higher.<p>In other words, Just sending a list of access points and signal strengths to Google gives them a rather accurate guess as to where you are in the world, much greater than just 100+ meters.<p>Also, Android can also figure out when you are in a car moving at highway speeds thanks to the accelerometer and is quite accurate at telling when you&#x27;re walking, jogging, biking, or driving.

8092087,comment,8090534,8091829,6,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"The essential function of a shell is to start processes. In Unix and Linux, the usual way to start a new process is to clone yourself (fork), and then have the clone replace itself with a new executable image (exec).<p>It&#x27;s kind of roundabout, but the brilliance of this approach lies in what happens between those two calls. There exists process metadata that survives the call to exec, such as where stdout goes, or whether the process is in the foreground. So shells call fork, the clone sets up the metadata for the target process, and then calls exec to start it.<p>But when a multithreaded program forks, the clone is very limited in what it can do (before exec). In particular, the clone must not acquire a lock that may have been held at the time of fork (which usually rules out heap allocations!). Now say something goes wrong: the clone needs to print an error message, <i>without</i> locking anything. But lots of functions acquire locks internally. How do you know what&#x27;s safe to call?<p>fish solves this by providing its own known-safe implementations of printf() and friends, and being careful to only call those after fork. Go solves this by disallowing any user-code between fork and exec. Instead it provides a single posix_spawn-like entry point called ForkExec, and does some black magic (like raw syscalls - see <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/syscall/exec_linux.go#39"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/syscall/e...</a> ) in between the underlying fork and exec calls.<p>My hunch is that a shell written in Go will eventually bump up against the limitations of ForkExec. Happily Go has a strong FFI, so you can hopefully implement this stuff in C, if it comes to that!",1406439328

But for some reason I find C-f and C-b much more obtuse. Part of it is that in a QWERTY layout, &quot;f&quot; is to the left of &quot;b&quot;, and yet &quot;f&quot; moves the cursor to the right. Also, assuming you press Ctrl with your left hand, &quot;f&quot; is more natural to use with your left hand, while &quot;b&quot; is a bit of an awkward reach, making it natural to use the right. This left-right switch is awkward, especially combined with the aforementioned direction reverse.<p>On the other hand, C-a and C-k (especially in combination with each other) and C-e are incredibly useful, and once I discovered them I immediately started using them everywhere.",1406439285

For a programmer working in a strict waterfall project, who&#x27;s &quot;just coding his allocated items of a per-determined feature list&quot;, passion might not be important (and may even be contra-indicated, they&#x27;ll likely leave when they work it out).

I suspect if an interview candidate lighted up telling the story of their quadcopter or bamboo bicycle or burningman project or anything where they can demonstrate solving problems within a set of constraints - even if it didn&#x27;t involve a single line of code - it would have been looked upon more favorably than somebody who can&#x27;t demonstrate passion about _anything_.",1406439065

I&#x27;m not really sure what type of help you&#x27;re looking for. I was a once computer science major, now clinical social worker. I work with people that have different stressors in their lives and are learning how to live a life they feel good about. In most cases I find, even with past horrific traumas, people are very  resilient. So the little I&#x27;ll offer you right now is this. In my own journey of healing and getting my life together, there is always a lot of noise. Things to &quot;worry about&quot; things to &quot;figure out&quot;. These often include career goals, life goals, etcetera. I have found often that much of my energy has been wasted on things that have not yet come to pass. The future stuff that I&#x27;m not quite ready for in that moment anyway. Of course plans are important, but in terms of getting &quot;help now&quot;, often we overlook or neglect our day to day basic needs for loose ill defined hopes. It&#x27;s not these things are not important, its just we very likely are not yet ready to hold ourselves up with enough firm ground to withstand the tremendous amount of unknown that entertaining such things requires. With that said, Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy is a helpful frame to start from in any trying times. You&#x27;ll find that when you consistently knock out a 100% of your basic needs (healthy food, shelter, meaningful relationships, meaningful daily activities, etc.), you&#x27;ll start naturally taking on bigger things. You must be a smart guy if you got into Stanford. Something the pressure of a &quot;name school&quot; has more baggage than its worth. I know what that&#x27;s like. I once went to a &quot;name school&quot; and found that I spent just as much energy on deflecting the image of what it meant to goto a place highly regarded and what that meant to the world around me - as I did on just trying to survive the experience. With that said, an important step for me, was to forget and let go of that image and build a real foundation of self-respect and confidence in myself that I felt. Once you tap into that, and you spend the time defining what YOU want to do, not what the world wants you to do - then you will begin to let the important things in and you will get better at passing on the distractions. I&#x27;m still learning how to do this. I graduated from my undergrad a decade ago. I&#x27;ve changed my career, felt lost, loved and lost multiple times, and am better for it.

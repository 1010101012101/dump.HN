The smart thing for an acquirer to do would be to wait until prospective targets are tapped out and can hear the wolves at the door. It isn't like there's a lot of potential suitors right now. The era of large acquisitions is over.",1230447478

It feels much better to be using Git and Emacs to manage the blog instead of random Web apps and crappy text editors.<p>Since then the number of jekyll forks on GitHub has exploded.  I've added tagging, fixed numerous bugs, made the templating work a little better, and added the ability to insert arbitrary script execution results (I use this to generate the tag cloud on my site).<p>You can find my fork at http;//github.com/metajack/jekyll/tree/master<p>I've also written an MT -> Jekyll convertor and an MT -> Disqus convertor which are at<p><a href=""http://github.com/metajack/mt2jekyll/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/metajack/mt2jekyll/tree/master</a><p>I imagine it will be a little while before the development free for all settles down, but until then, it is easy to hack on and easy to grok.",1230446959

You intuitively know this -- if there was such compelling proof, you would be able to convince a lot of people of the potential, rather than saying ""no, I don't have to prove it, you need to prove science."" Science is already proven. I'm not denying the potential of alternative treatments, but for now, I expect you and I both would take the chemotherapy over making ourselves guinea pigs.",1230446864

411754,comment,411022,411022,0,0,gcv,,,"What about abandonware? Consider two different scenarios. In the first, the manufacturer or distributor no longer makes the product (game) available, but it runs well enough under emulation. In the second, the manufacturer and distributor have both gone out of business. In both cases, the term of copyright has not expired. In both cases, the game is timeless enough to be worth playing even if it looks a bit dated.",1230446062

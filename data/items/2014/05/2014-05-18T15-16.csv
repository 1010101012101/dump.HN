7763371,comment,7762577,7762577,4,0,greggman,,,"Just a random &quot;obvious&quot; comment but..<p>I&#x27;ve lost some weight recently by cutting my intake. My inspiration was my sister who used to be 5&#x27;2&quot; and 260lbs but is now ~130lbs. She got her stomach stapled and for some number of months was on a 500 calorie a day diet. (I don&#x27;t recommend that)<p>Anyway, seeing that and reading things here on HN about how calorie restriction has an order of magnitude more effect than exercise (which I do) I decided to try to eat ~1500 calories a day for a while.<p><i></i>It&#x27;s surprisingly HARD because of how little food that is.<i></i><p>They way people eat in the USA, it&#x27;s crazy how large the portions are. I&#x27;m in Japan where the portions are smaller but, calories are labeled on most things and even with small portions it&#x27;s amazing to me just how little I can eat and stay under 2000 a day let alone 1500 a day.<p>A &quot;small&quot; Japanese convenience store style sandwich is 300 calories. Those are probably only 60% the size of the smallest sandwich I&#x27;d see in the USA. Pretty much any small Japanese pastry, donut, thing made with bread is 300-500 calories. Again those are at least 30% smaller than their USA counterparts.<p>Soda, Fruit juice, coffee with sugar, etc, all around 140 calories for 12oz.<p>Potato-chips or fries or a sugary snack? Forget about it!<p>The point is, it wasn&#x27;t until I actually tried seriously looking at my calorie intake that I realized how many calories I was consuming. A small lunch, a medium dinner and a snack and I&#x27;m over 2000 calories easily. There&#x27;s no way I could fit any kind of &quot;normal&quot; breakfast in that routine and still fit in 1500-2000 calories.<p>Anyway, I guess like I said that&#x27;s kind of obvious but for whatever reason it wasn&#x27;t to me until I actually started paying attention.  As for being hungry all the time, yea, because of 48+ years of eating way too much my idea of what a meal should be or how much I should eat to feel like I&#x27;ve done more than just had a snack is seriously out of whack.",1400428510
7763370,comment,7762868,7762868,3,0,morganherlocker,,,"Just about everyone writes tests first. You have some sort of script that you are running against the real code you are working on to see if it is doing what it should be doing. The only real difference between true &quot;TDD&quot; and everyone else, is that the TDD folks save this script to be run later.<p>I might be so far down the TDD trail that I have lost perspective, but do people really write huge swaths of code without writing scripts to run the code and see what it is doing? Those little scripts are tests, and with a tiny bit of formatting, they can be made to output something consistently useful like TAP[1], instead of inconsistent console logs.

7763355,comment,7762868,7763217,3,0,barries,,,"There are several issues with relying solely on feature tests.<p>Feature tests often need to span large parts of an application, so there is a often significant amount of overhead (both code and test-time) in repeating identical-except-for-one-value.<p>Feature tests often can&#x27;t test the corner cases of internal code. For example, one hallmark of quality software is that it degrades gracefully in the presence of unexpected inputs. So, while the UI might prevent out-of-range values, programmers often choose to also check value ranges at, for example, the top of a stored procedure. This means that you can&#x27;t test that code with an app-level feature test because a correct UI won&#x27;t let you enter values to trigger the stored proc&#x27;s failure case.<p>Another big issue is the combinatorial explosion. If you have a processing pipeline, like filters in a sound or image processing app or validation and authorization checks in a line-of-business app, the number of configuration and data values that need to be tested for each stage needs multiply together if you only feature test. Unit testing allows you to make sure each of the stages works &quot;well enough&quot;[1], then you can use far fewer integration and feature tests to make sure that the stages cooperate properly and that system requirements are met (two overlapping, but different, concerns).<p>[1] However the engineer, team or industry defines &quot;well enough&quot;.<p>[Edit: split up the wall &#x27;o text]",1400428143

7763331,comment,7762413,7762413,1,0,jasallen,,,"While I agree with the end sentiment &quot;Crossfit is not a great program&quot; I&#x27;ve got several problems with this article.<p>1) A lot of discussion of being sore.  Sure one of the first things mentioned is &quot;I&#x27;ve been sore before&quot;, but then we move on to more complaining about it.  That is a natural part of doing any new movements, no matter how in shape you are overall.<p>2) No appreciation of the value of high rep movements.  True, they are not good for hypertrophy (probably, even there the research is shakey whether low and high should be mixed), but they are good for building connective tissue strength, for burning calories, for increasing range of motion in a movement, for bone density...<p>3) Author links a balanced WebMD article but the link text implies it fully agrees with the negativity.<p>4) Article doesn&#x27;t talk much about joint issues which are probably the biggest concern a lot people have with crossfit movements.  The violence of many of the movement can lead to muscle and connective tissue problems, but those heal and are obvious.<p>So, what are my issues with Crossfit?<p>1) Quality control.  The excuse of crossfitters to &quot;just find a better gym, they aren&#x27;t all like that&quot; is inadequate.  Its a single program and a single franchise making money off each gym-goer, not an abstract concept like say HIIT.  Ask Krispy Kreme or Quiznos how the no-quality control franchise theory works.<p>2) They rely on joint stability and momentum as much or more than on muscle.  You are simply getting no benefit from that.<p>3) The movements are violent unnecessarily, this I agree with the author on.  The joint reliance, the <i>tugging</i> at muscles and tendons, are all high risk for injury.  While there are things that type of work can build that regular weight training cannot, the risk/reward is only worth it for people with specific training needs and doing specifically valuable movements.  Kettle bells and kipping pull ups are pretty much never as valuable as good mornings, dead lifts, assisted pullups, and lat pulldowns.  Clean and jerk has valuable movements taken separately, but combines them with high joint risk moves in between.",1400427602
7763330,comment,7762424,7762424,28,0,bane,,,"One of the main differences between herbivores and carnivores (and the various omnivores that rank in between) is what their digestive system is optimized for.<p>Herbivores tend to have longer (relative to body length), more complex and less acidic digestive tracts than Carnivores. Their systems tend to make more use of grinding and physically breaking down plant fibers to get at the sugars in the material. Even then, herbivores get surprisingly little nutrition from plants and almost always have to by grazing or eating. About 50% of the food herbivores eat is excreted as waste.<p>Modern farming techniques solves some of this by providing easier to digest feed to the animals, usually high in protein. The feed is often made up of other animals (one of the sources of issues during the mad cow disease problem a few years ago). Herbivores generally lack the mechanical mouth parts to be effective meat eaters, but will eat animal products more or less just fine if presented in a digestible format (they don&#x27;t produce all the right enzymes all the time and their stomachs aren&#x27;t quite as acidic, but in some small amounts it can actually be healthy for the animal). If you&#x27;ve ever worked near or on a farm, you&#x27;ll know about various herbivorous animals eating non-plant items pretty frequently. This article is a no duh that&#x27;s common knowledge to any farmer.<p>Herbivores come in a few types as well, ruminants have complex multi-compartmented stomachs. As with anything complex, they tend to have a wide variety of failure modes when eating as well. The complex flora in their digestive systems often creates gaseous environments that don&#x27;t often have a good way to escape. A surprisingly common vet procedure is to basically just punch a hole in the side of a ruminant to provide a vent for outgassing.<p>Carnivores tend to have shorter (relative to body length), less complex and more acidic digestive tracts. Protein simply processes faster than cellulose and can be broken down by acids and a few enzymes. Anybody who&#x27;s owned a dog or cat can tell you that carnivores eat plants all the time. It doesn&#x27;t digest well though as they simply lack the mechanisms to digest cellulose and usually it comes out more or less like it went in. True carnivores also tend to not have as much or any gut flora, which aids in breaking down and digesting plant matter.<p>As with many things in nature, life is a spectrum. Most things fit somewhere on that spectrum, cows are more herbivore, while goats (as goat owners can tell you) are slightly less, while lions are on the other end as pretty much carnivores. Bears, apes, humans, dogs, pigs etc. all fit in various places on this spectrum.<p>Humans have digestive systems that are basically somewhere between a simple herbivore and a carnivore (a horse and a dog). Humans, like brown and black bears have digestive systems that aren&#x27;t particularly optimized to process plant or animal products, but are optimized to switch &quot;modes&quot; over a short period of time. A diet of largely plants will turn out systems to become more acidic and we&#x27;ll start cultivating gut bacteria to aid in digestion. A diet of largely meats and we&#x27;ll start to switch to a more alkaline intestinal environment. One problem is that our systems never really complete either transition, so we&#x27;re not particularly efficient or complete either way.<p>Our mouth parts are more like a carnivore than an herbivore, but evolution has reduced some of the more useful hunter parts, our canines are pretty small at this point. However, our molars are still meant for ripping and not flat for grinding like a herbivore&#x27;s. Our jaws provide vertical movement like a carnivore, not rotary grinding motions like a herbivore. Our stomach capacity relative to our body size is almost exactly within carnivore parameters and we pass food out of our stomach and into our intestinal tract about as quickly. We have strong stomach acid compared to herbivores and our stomachs provide almost no digestive activity (a tremendous amount of digestion occurs in an herbivore&#x27;s stomach).<p>Our intestines are closer to a carnivore&#x27;s, and our feces are produced and have consistency like a carnivore&#x27;s. We have developed gallbladders (helpful for breaking down animal proteins) and our pancreas is a major contributor of enzymes needed for digestion (unlike herbivores).<p>In cases where humans need surgical intervention, a surprising amount of our digestive tract can be removed and we&#x27;ll survive. Herbivores need much more of their tract relatively to survive. Humans for example can live without a stomach, colon and cecum. Herbivores cannot.<p>What&#x27;s actually surprising about humans is how well we can live on diets made up mostly or solely of plant or animal material. There&#x27;s some nutrients we don&#x27;t get as well out of one kind of  material, and our bodies don&#x27;t produce some of the nutrients that animals on the extremes of the spectrum make naturally. It&#x27;s likely we were scavengers and opportunists, eating pretty much whatever we could get our hands on. We&#x27;ve had weapons and meat processing tools in our inventory since before we were homo sapiens a quarter of a million years ago. The oldest unambiguous weapons are throwing spears from the Palaeolithic 300,000 years ago in a cache full of thousands of animal bones. Meat processing tools have been found much older than Homo erectus (up to 2 million years ago). We&#x27;ve been hunting and eating animals as part of our diet long enough for evolutionary forces to have an affect. If our ancestors were ever herbivores, it was long <i>long</i> before then (millions upon millions of years), and indications are that we&#x27;ve moved rapidly towards the carnivorous end of the spectrum (i.e. our mouth parts aren&#x27;t anything like an herbivores and neither are any of our known ancestors). In fact it&#x27;s known that meat was a major part of Homo erectus diets, but cooking was unknown to them. This diet was so effective that Homo Erectus lasted for well over a million years.",1400427520

Because their parents already grown up in a culture where food was cheap.<p>So there are only a few things one could do:<p>1st - try to keep your children thin. Let them make sport, let them drive bicycle to school, and do not drive them by car. Avoid sugar, especially fructose.<p>2nd - its to late, once you left puberty. Only a hormone change could change weight. Women get a 2nd chance to get thin when pregnant or during menopause. But they normally get fatter.<p>3rd - So just try to live with your weight. Start a sport where weight is good, e.g. sailing. Every sailor is always searching for fat crew, as self loading ballast on the rail. Even if sailing does not feel like sport, you burn lots of calories by moving your body to balance the waves. You learn to move your fat fast, and to balance yourself, even with high weight. A few years sailing might only cause 10lbs of weight loss, but the health benefit is much bigger then just the weight loss.

TDD is a methodology, a tool, and it&#x27;s been found helpful by many practitioners.<p>That said, the problem is that TDD is often presented as The One True Way. Even people who should know better say &quot;I&#x27;m not saying TDD is the only way, but if you don&#x27;t do it, show me what you use that is as good&quot;. (I&#x27;m looking at you, Uncle Bob). This has the unstated assumption that TDD is the best tool available, and that you&#x27;re doing something wrong if you don&#x27;t use it, and that you have the burden to explain why you do something else. Again, <i>even</i> people who claim &quot;use the right tool for the right job&quot; will usually look at you with skepticism if you claim you&#x27;ve found a job for which TDD is not good, somewhat negating their claim that they&#x27;re open-minded about it.<p>I&#x27;ve heard the following (somewhat contradictory) claims about TDD:<p>- &quot;Every single line you write must be covered by TDD, otherwise you&#x27;re doing it wrong.&quot;<p>- &quot;TDD is about design, not about testing. Testing is merely a nice side-effect.&quot;<p>- &quot;You cannot refactor safely without TDD.&quot;<p>- &quot;If your test isn&#x27;t red first, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.&quot;<p>- &quot;TDD makes your code more testable.&quot;<p>- &quot;TDD can drive design and lead you to a solution.&quot;<p>- &quot;A reasonable way to develop a mathematical function like Fibonacci is to use TDD&quot; (I <i>never</i> can get if the person writing this knows that&#x27;s not the case but forgets to explain it, or if they truly believe that. Either way, they hurt the case for TDD).<p>Each of these assumptions is either demonstrably wrong or at least arguable. But TDD zealots (again, not talking about commenters on HN, but TDD&#x27;s well-known evangelists) will make you feel bad if you doubt a single one. IMO, this is the single thing driving most of the backlash against TDD. If we instead demote TDD from its priviledged place to &quot;one methodology, not formally proven, that may or may not work for you&quot;, I presume the backlash will go away.

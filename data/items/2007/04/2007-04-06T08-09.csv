9546,comment,9361,9361,0,0,oltsm,,,"Actually, there is a subtle point in the way YC is approaching this whole thing and the person missed the point. Assume there exists a world without YC, how many people will spend time doing something they believe on and make effort to take it to a point so that you can show it to someone? Probably a vast majority would anyway do it. say 90%, what YC is trying to do is - try to squeeze a percent or two of the remaining 10% by making them work by promising them that they'd fund if you come up with something interesting and that adds  a certain value to the society as a whole. <p>So it is certainly a waste of time if - you think of an idea, write an application and decide to work on only if YC is funding it.. <p>But not - when you are working on something or planning to work on something, YC offers you that last bit of motivation to actually go and do it because you want to play the YC gamble. <p>And it might happen that otherwise, you end up building something, YC rejects you, but you say to yourself, what the heck, I have already done something so lets take it to a  logical conclusion (may be 90% will chicken out. but who knows one of those who persisted might be next big thing!!) YC has certainly helped them, who would have been left in ""I am planning to do"" state otherwise and I think thats what PG is essentially trying to do. Make more people try a stint at 'startuping' and all of this comes at a reasonable cost to everyone!! <p>To conclude - would the authors' brother have not been happy if there was an ""Irish Pub"" or something that promised, hey if you send us your recordings, may be we can give you a saturday night and if you get a deal from a recording company, we get cut out of it... (Ouch! I just spit out an idea for some ""irish pub"" owner, if he's on the list!) ",1175848908

You have to find ways to elegantly and efficiently solve _your_ problems specifically. I say with confidence that if you aren't willing to be very involved in the scale out of your service, you'll likely design a service that won't scale out.  <p>(For an example of an elegant tool used in scale out, see Facebook's thrift.)<p>Also, if service agnostic scale out is a small problem for you to solve, I encourage you to get rich by solving it.  I'll buy your solution if it works.",1175848694

Ironically, the old school SOAP 1.1 way of doing things (with a header and a post) is immune from this.  <p>Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't JSON and the script tag way of calling things explicitly designed to DEFEAT the same origin policy?  If the entire point of your data transfer method is to make it possible for anyone to request your data, you should only send data that everyone should be able to see =P

9543,comment,9361,9393,0,0,rms,,,"You'd be surprised at the kind of basic feedback you can get when you just tell someone your idea. I've heard that PG will respond to emails of this type. I got feedback from Dharmesh Shaw when I told him my idea.<p>In biotech, I emailed Joerg Poetzsch to ask a question about early stage funding. I got a lengthy response from him. Then, I told him my idea and we've had a wonderful exchange since then -- he ended up writing me a letter of recommendation and said he is interested in selling my product for a percentage of the revenue he generates.<p>So, if you want basic feedback about your idea, email someone with a blog or website and I promise you can get some feedback. If someone takes 1% of your company for that, you're getting ripped off.",1175847254
9542,comment,9540,9540,0,0,BitGeek,,,"History- Learned Lisp in High School in the 1980s. Since then, procedural (Pascal & C) and then about 17 years of object oriented development.. C++, Java, Ruby, Objective-C.<p>I am interested in concurrency oriented programming now... and have been directed to Erlang.   Others seem to talk about Lisp alot.  (I remember enjoying it, but feeling that it wasn't too practical.. but it was only the 3rd or 4th language I learned and I was 17 at the time.) <p>What seems to be the natural parallelism in Erlang really appeals to me.  The 1960s era syntax does not. (I still think in objects.)   I haven't investigated Haskell much, or Lisp recently.<p>If one wants to solve a problem that is naturally highly parallel (like raytracing) what language would you recommend? <p>I'm open to hearing about other languages than the ones I mentioned. <p>I'm not interested in careful programming to be thread safe, or mutexes, etc.  <p>Also, I don't really want to start a flame war... but haven't seen many opinions, or specifically an argument for Lisp from a concurrency viewpoint.  And if there's a much better language than Erlang out there, I'd love to find out about it now. <p>And of course, meta arguments by posting links to others advocacy of particular language also appreciated.",1175847033

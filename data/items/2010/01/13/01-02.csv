1049172,comment,1048800,1048800,0,0,newhouseb,,,"I just talked to a friend of mine in the computer industry, native Chinese, my age (early 20s).  I asked him about the Google news and he said when it comes to economics he's quite the idiot, and such things don't really concern him much.  It's kind of ironic, since I recall him mentioning that Google was thinking of pulling out of China months ago.  He did mention however that other new restrictions on things like registering .cn domains had caused him great inconvenience (he had to migrate all of his stuff to a .com), so that evidences he's not all roses about everything Chinese gov't wise.<p>It appears that within China this is being spun as the surrender of a foreign company failing to understand the Chinese market, and outside China as some sort of stand on Humans Rights.  Probably both are true, but I think it's interesting to see the perspectives as reported by both sides.",1263347968

1049169,comment,1048800,1049137,0,0,netcan,,,"I come from a somewhat similar background. I work in marketing and I am somewhat of an amateur economist.<p>I agree with you about the strawman. But many economists or more commonly, people with economics in their backgrounds take this sort of a view. They like to distil things to an economics ""story."" Sometimes this is a great tool. Sometimes this loses important info. Economics training does come with the danger of this kind of mistake though. I heard that there was a serious divide between students and old timers about Ostrom receiving the Nobel (the students didn't like it).<p>One ""story"" they (the against camp) told was: If being good is more profitable, companies will do it without being told. That's capitalism, nothing <i>creative</i> about it. If it isn't more profitable and they do it, they are forcing shareholders to contribute a charity of the company's choosing.<p>Another was the one I mentioned above. If you take an economics graduate, you may find that they're not sure what make of a world where getting customers to choose you're same price, same value product is the difference between non-starter & Unilever. It doesn't make sense to tell this story with the <i>basic</i> vocabulary of microeconomics.<p>In any case, some essays published in the book make this argument. I don't mean to suggest that all or even most economists would take this view. Great economists (like great anyone) are empowered, but not restricted by their tools.",1263347886

1049141,comment,1041774,1041774,0,0,etherael,,,"I switched to Linux in the days of Windows 3.11 + MS DOS 6.22, I was happy with it back then, it required more tooling around to get anything to work, but once the tooling around was done, it stayed working and it did not crash. At the time I was not entirely aware of why this was the case, but it was definitely apparent.<p>In retrospect, the reliability was contingent on the simplicity, beyond netscape and an xterminal window with a few editors and ncurses based programs, there was little that I ever used, and little that could ever go wrong. At the same time in the mainstream world people were attempting to shoehorn advanced applications into a far less advanced operating environment and the stability and usage issues that ensued were entirely concurrent with what one would expect for the situation. I realise now that I traded ill fit and ease of use for reliability and simplicity.<p>As time has gone by, both branches have slowly diverged toward one another, where the current situation stands between Windows 7 and the latest version of Ubuntu Linux both systems are highly technically advanced, running on mindbogglingly powerful hardware ( by comparison to back when I started ) and the seperating points between them appear to be shrinking all the time.<p>The way I use Windows 7 is modelled on the way I use Linux, I have VirtuaWin with hotkeyed multiple desktops (while in Linux I use Compiz with hotkeyed cube faces) Launchy (vs Gnome-do in Linux). But at some level within Windows things fail to compare to the equivalents in Linux, Package management is far superior in Linux, Gnome-do plugins allow it to be far more advanced and integrated than Launchy can be for windows; for example gnome do hotkey + username to quickswitch to a pidgin window for that user so I don't have to take my hands off the keyboard. After all these years the Windows environment has not done much to improve it's abysmal terminal environment, and I do not consider Cygwin a viable option considering something as simple as switching directories can take over 3 seconds and is totally throwing when you're trying to maintain mental flow. Development environments / server emulation environments within linux are far superior also, but without much difficulty, in either case one can simply virtualise what is needed from the other environment anyhow.<p>On the other hand, Linux applications are still far more rare than windows applications, the world at large assumes that everyone uses windows and happily throws around documents from the office suite without so much as a consideration that these might be annoying to deal with. Openoffice goes some way to mitigating this, but it's unrealistic to say that surviving in the application ecosystem on Linux is just as simple as the same ecosystem within Windows. Microsoft / Adobe applications (especially flash, my love for linux is inversely proportional to my hatred for Adobe at any given moment due to how utterly <i>bad</i> adobe applications / support for Linux tend to be in general)<p>In conclusion, they both have their advantages and disadvantages, and I am happy to use both in virtualised or dualboot contexts, I believe limiting oneself one way or the other is probably a mistake.<p>I realise that the above is of course only going to apply to my own needs as a Developer / Systems Administrator. If you're a designer or office worker or something then I can imagine very little reason for you to be a Linux user instead of a Windows or OS X user.",1263346684

Coming from both an economics and marketing background, I would suggest most economists believe that companies should act in the interests of their shareholders.<p>Charity can be a form of marketing just as creating a culture where at times short term profits may be sacrificed for long term benefits is also very much in the best interests of shareholders.  Thus, the beauty of this economic system is that while you can profit by pursuing profit for its own sake (which can mean being charitable), I do think taking a principled approach results in more sustained and greater long term profitability - as I suspect irrespective of the outcome, this will be a case study for years to come.",1263346369

While these may be technical in nature, they're often very shallow and redundant.<p>As far as I know, it would be an impressive feat to determine depth automatically, but I think it would give you a better picture of how the tone is changing over time in a relevant way.

When criticizing these actions, it helps to understand the tremendous strains within China.  China has changed more in the last 10 years than possibly any other country in the history of the world.  These changes are accompanied by massive externalities.  There are some serious powder kegs of anger and resentment, Xinjiang being a prime example.  I'm not taking you to task for your criticism, but if you were a top government leader in China today, how would you handle these issues?  Keep in mind that if your answer is to just make things free and open, there will most likely be a price to pay.  You may say the short-term price of social disruption is worth the potential long-term benefits.  However, there is no guarantee China would survive such extensive social disorder.<p>Controlling internet traffic is both a citizen control issue and an economic protection plan.  I don't know what is in the reams of WTO deals China has made but its possible they never agreed to play free and open with companies outside China for access to their Internet user base.  You may not agree with this protectionist approach, but it fits squarely within China's ""middle-kingdom"" mentality.<p>Again, don't take my words as a defense of any of China's actions.

Sure, they've always attacked foreign governments, but China's government <i>depends</i> on US companies spending Dollars overseas. Since consumer spending is down in USA, it only seems natural for China to start banking on the successful industries of today, like internet advertising. Is the political danger of human rights activists really worth more than the money that Google brings? Or were their egos so high that they thought they could get away with it, either by avoiding detection or keeping Google at status quo<p>Maybe the Chinese government + military is just too huge to get everyone to toe the party line.",1263345084

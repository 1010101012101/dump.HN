In most large outdoor lots in the US, there are street lights. And when those aren&#x27;t present apply, this still isn&#x27;t exactly an enormous investment, and it can be rolled out piecemeal.

8801630,comment,8797519,8800981,0,0,chubot,,,"This is basically like the HMAC(secret, acct#) suggestion further up in the thread.  Macaroons are an extension of this idea -- a chain of HMACs instead of a single one.<p>The idea is to limit the power of the credential, so that when it&#x27;s stolen, the negative impact is mitigated.<p>In the paper, they compare macaroons to plain cookies.  When you steal a cookie these days, you can take control of an entire account -- maybe even change the password, etc.<p>In this situation, with the simple HMAC / guid / hash, once somebody &quot;steals&quot; the URL, then it can be leaked to everybody, forever.  It can&#x27;t be fixed without &quot;breaking&quot; the app.<p>The macaroon technique can also solve the expiration issue.  In my post, I described how you would add a caveat for the filename.  You can also add a caveat based on time.  So then stealing the Macaroon would only authorize the attacker for a limited team -- even a single request (this is talked about in the paper).<p>A legitimate user can be minted new macaroons constantly based on his login.  But the attacker can be locked out based on the expiration.  So the attacker&#x27;s problem is elevated from stealing a single cookie/macaroon to stealing either the login or ALL macaroons, which is generally harder.  With Macaroons, you don&#x27;t have credentials of full power constantly traveling back and forth over the network.<p>That is my understanding anyway... actually implementing it will probably reveal some more insights.",1419652651

Since the Macintosh had much tighter memory constraints, we needed to write most of our system-oriented code in the most efficient way possible, using the native language of the processor, 68000 assembly language. Even so, we could still use Lisa code by hand translating the Pascal into assembly language.<p>&quot;We directly incorporated Quickdraw, Bill Atkinson&#x27;s amazing bit-mapped graphics package, since it was already written mostly in assembly language. We also used the Lisa window and menu managers, which we recoded in assembly language from Bill&#x27;s original Pascal, reducing the code size by a factor of two or so.

8801623,comment,8797519,8797983,0,0,talideon,,,"> 100% Agree. As a registrar (and as someone who personally has been in the business since the mid 90&#x27;s) we don&#x27;t even offer it. But yet not a day goes by (ok an exaggeration) where we get a legitimate business that thinks they need privacy because it&#x27;s going to somehow protect them from spam or getting their domain stolen or they&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s the right thing to do.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think WHOIS privacy is something a business ought to be using, but it&#x27;s perfectly legitimate for private individuals to use it.<p>> The large registrars push this as a profit center and/or some kind of benefit to enhance their offerings.<p>It is, because it&#x27;s something the registrar can do at little or no cost. Given registrars work at thin margins, there are good reasons why even smaller registrars tend to offer WHOIS privacy.<p>> Lastly, lack of public info on ownership (so no trail of ownership at whois history) makes it much harder to prove you own the domain if something happens at the registrar. You are depending on them to have all their records in order. If they get hacked, go out of business and so on you could have a problem proving ownership. (However small it&#x27;s not worth the risk).<p>That&#x27;s precisely what data escrow through Iron Mountain is intended for, and why ICANN have been enforcing RDE since the failure of RegisterFly.<p>The key thing to keep in mind is that what is shown in WHOIS isn&#x27;t necessarily what needs to be escrowed. A registrant is meant to provide accurate data to the registrar, and it&#x27;s this data that has to be escrowed, but this data doesn&#x27;t have to be what&#x27;s published in WHOIS. This is why the only way to legitimately do WHOIS privacy is through the registrar of record. Anybody who&#x27;s dumb enough to use a third party is asking for trouble.<p>If you&#x27;re not escrowing the underlying ownership information (that is, the real registrant, admin, tech and billing contact details), then you&#x27;re in breach of the RAA.<p>> Also many of the early privacy programs actually put ownership in the registrar&#x27;s hands but had a separate contract with the actual registrant (not sure if that is needed anymore).<p>That can be solved by making it clear in the WHOIS details that the details displayed in WHOIS are for an agent acting the actual registrant. The registrar I work for also forwards any details sent to the email address published in WHOIS with WHOIS privacy on to the actual contact behind the scenes. Also, the registrar is required to escrow the real details.",1419652375

If you use very inflammatory language, you need to accept a degree of responsibility it the discussion veers rapidly off topic.<p>PG chose to appy the phrase &quot;anti-immigrant&quot; to the people he disagrees with.<p>Keep in mind, there are people who support high levels of immigration (the US currently takes 1.2+ million immigrants a year), support a path to legalization for people already living here illegally, even support general skilled immigration.  They simply don&#x27;t see evidence for a specific shortage of high tech workers, and, as a result, oppose tinkering with the immigration system in a way designed to specifically increase the percentage of programmers who are immigrants.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s pretty appalling to call people like this &quot;anti-immigrant&quot;.

8801619,comment,8799572,8799572,0,0,silverlake,,,"There are a number of problems with this argument. (1) Great programmers are not evenly distributed around the world because most places lack good educational systems. It makes sense that most are in 1st world countries. (2) Big companies have offices in India, China and elsewhere. Immigration policy does not prevent Google from hiring every great programmer on the planet. What&#x27;s their complaint? (3) Do many companies need great programmers? Sorry, but your web/mobile app isn&#x27;t rocket surgery. (4) For every single product on the planet the market finds a price to match supply & demand. Why are tech jobs different? $200k in SF is worse than $100K in Dallas. Increase salaries; problem solved. (5) PG says startups are DESPERATE! Yet they won&#x27;t consider remote employees, so I guess they aren&#x27;t that desperate. (6) No one can spot a &quot;great&quot; programmer in a pile of resumes. Maybe your interviews and hiring committees suck?<p>The least controversial policy is 1st world countries give their foreign STEM grads Green Cards (or equivalent). The 2nd easy solution is to pay top programmers lots more money. If they are indeed worth &quot;100X or even 1000X&quot; more than the average, it makes economic sense to pay at least 5X more. Only hedge funds seem to understand this. Finally, any company with 200+ employees can put an office in India/China and hire everyone they want. You can either wait for politicians to change immigration laws, or make remote offices work. Which is more likely?",1419652113

8801594,comment,8792778,8798389,0,0,Jongseong,,,"I am well aware of the language situation in Italy, and I hesitated a bit before using it as an example. I probably should have qualified my use of the word &quot;dialect&quot; as you rightly point out. I do remind people from time to time that the regional languages in Italy are languages in their own right, and indeed the &quot;dialects&quot; spoken in Italy don&#x27;t form a natural subgroup of the Romance languages, either (Piedmontese and Lombard are probably closer to the subgroup of the Western Romance languages that includes French rather than the one that contains Italian). But for my point here the distinction between languages and dialects is not important. The point is that in all of Italy, regardless of the local dialect or regional language, people are taught standard Italian. If we divide Italy, the Southern half is not going to switch to, say, Neapolitan, or the Northern half to Lombard, in spite of the rich literary traditions of these regional languages.<p>The situation in Korean is not qualitatively different, either. For instance, the Jeju &quot;dialect&quot; (now sadly moribund) is definitely not mutually intelligible with other dialects of Korean some authorities would insist on classifying it as a separate language. Even the mainland dialects (as they are traditionally considered as opposed to distinct languages) are considerably different from each other, not just in lexical items but in the existence of different grammatical categories (e.g. distinguishing between yes/no and wh-questions), morphology (the conjugation of verbs and adjectival verbs is all different), and phonology (different consonant and especially vowel inventories, different stress/pitch systems), to the degree that I wonder how much communication would be possible if it had not been for the imposition of standard Korean.<p>I used Italy as an example instead of the U.S., because it is a stretch to say that the U.S. has different dialects as the speech is quite uniform across the vast country compared to what you see in Korea; or the U.K., where the existence of Scots complicates the analogy. I did not intend to minimize the diversity of regional languages in Italy.",1419651500

8801581,comment,8798800,8801377,0,0,acabal,,,"Businesses and culture are very different.  Businesses exist solely to make money, and perhaps solve a real-world problem doing it.  You can start a new dry-cleaning business even though there&#x27;s another dry cleaner across the street who does the exact same thing.<p>Culture--the fabric of our past, woven through creative work like art and literature--isn&#x27;t the same.  Some culture exists to make money, but much doesn&#x27;t. We all absorb it almost without realizing it or intending to.  A child might inherit a dry-cleaner and build a career running and improving it, or likewise failing and causing the inheritance to go bust.  But the child of JK Rowling had absolutely no practical bearing on the creation of Harry Potter, and the books Rowling already wrote are unalterable.  Thus children who inherit intellectual &quot;property&quot; wind up as pure rent-seekers on our culture, at best idle managers/stewards of someone <i>else&#x27;s</i> hard work.<p>(Now you might say that a child might inherit an apartment building, thus making <i>them</i> rent-seekers in the practical sense--and that&#x27;s true, literally.  But an apartment building has taxes, upkeep, maintenance, etc. involved--it requires work to maintain.  But opening a mailbox to collect the royalty check on your grandparent&#x27;s grandparent&#x27;s novel is rent-seeking in the philosophical sense.)<p>Furthermore, new culture is invariably built upon old culture.  All the famous old Disney films that Disney is trying so hard to keep out of the public domain were themselves based on public-domain work.  Try using a character from a Disney film in your work and see how quickly their lawyers find you.  Try copying a dry-cleaner wholesale and you&#x27;re just one more business on the block.<p>In short, comparing an inherited business to an inherited intangible cultural work isn&#x27;t a fair comparison.  It might <i>seem</i> fair because nowadays we (tragically!) use the word &quot;property&quot; to describe what is actually a &quot;temporary government-sanctioned monopoly&quot;--but ideas aren&#x27;t property, and business isn&#x27;t culture.",1419651306

You may not like conclusion (b), but you should not let this obscure the fact that the court also drew conclusion (a).<p>>The person you are citing as an expert is either confused or malicious.<p>Again, you&#x27;re getting mixed up. Greenwald pointed out that the Swedish government can veto extradition requests. He did not say that they can authorize extradition requests without the approval of the Swedish courts. In your previous post you said &quot;...extradition from Sweden to the United States [does not] require permission from the Swedish courts&quot;. This claim false, so far as I can see, and unsourced. Neither Greenwald not the experts he cites say anything to support it.<p>> If you want to convince me that this is an &quot;ordinary&quot; prosecution<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you keep going off on this tangent. I think it&#x27;s a legally and morally justified prosecution, and so &quot;ordinary&quot; in that sense. I don&#x27;t know (and cannot know) whether Assange&#x27;s public profile is part of the reason that the EAW was issued. Perhaps it was, perhaps it wasn&#x27;t. Either way, the EAW remains legitimate on its own terms.<p>> extradited for allegedly not wearing a condom<p>You must know this is a dishonest summary of Assange&#x27;s alleged conduct, so I suppose there is no point in correcting it (the High Court judgment has the details).",1419649831

I know people in the ICANN registrar constituency, and to the best of my knowledge there have been no discussions of this.<p>Now, what <i>is</i> the case is that there&#x27;s been a crackdown, due to pressure from law enforcement agencies, on incorrect details being set on domains. However, this actually has no effect on what&#x27;s published in WHOIS because the only actual requirement is that the registrar have the correct details for the domain on record and escrowed. So long as the registrar has correct details, the registrar can mask the detail in WHOIS however is applicable, so long as it&#x27;s clear that WHOIS privacy is in place.",1419649825

The sustainability is a good point! Within the US there are around 11k new borns per day and the average age of first time parents is 25.6 years old. Worldwide there are everyday around 370k new borns and the average age for first time parents is even younger (22.8 years old). That in combination with how much money first time parents spend for their new borns can be an interesting market.

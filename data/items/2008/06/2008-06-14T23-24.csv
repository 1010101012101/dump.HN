Russert was the best of the bunch, and you seem unable to separate the disease from one of the doctors.  Why?<p>As for ""controlling the message"", name one government on this planet that doesn't.<p>Russert, in the lead up to the war, WAS asking the critical questions. Few were listening though. And as the highest rated Sunday ""news"" program, he used his pulpit to the best of his ability and profession. Shoot, name one American TV journalist that did better during that time.",1213486533

217766,comment,217704,217704,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"I think the problem is the interface forces the projection of two dimensions (agreement and quality) on to a single dimension (score).<p>Personally I think the upvote/downvote should be for indicating quality but there should be a separate counter for agreement that would not affect the overall ordering.  A separate agreement counter would also allow for some interesting options such as showing the comments of people who tend to strongly agree or disagree with someone.",1213486409
217765,comment,217626,217626,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I read the paper, and I must be missing something. (I'm not a computer scientist, so there's probably something important here that's flying right over my head.)<p>The paper mentions ""fault tolerance"" a number of times, and I'm thinking, ""fantastic! They've got some magic in there so that if a node goes down, there are automatically some number of nodes that can instantly take over its place."" Except, they don't ... their fault tolerance sounds like they just expect to use servers with really good data recovery. It does mention a primary backup server that's supposed to shadow each other data server, but now we're talking about an effective 2n nodes. Also, it doesn't sound like it would be all that fault tolerant in the event of network problems (broken pipe between nodes, denial of service attack, etc.), or if the root node goes down.<p>Since they're only storing actual data in leaf nodes, they're not outperforming a classic balanced binary tree in search time.<p>It does sound like they've done some good work in making sure that they keep data integrity in the event of client-server communication problems, but that's also been solved by a number of database and file systems already.<p>So ... can someone explain the novelty here?",1213486081

That's part of what pisses people off about Rails devs.<p>The reality is, learning framework features is no different than learning how to mail-merge with your word processor. Sure, it's important.

I doubt I had formed many beliefs about the universe when I was only 5 or 6, but my tendency to stay up late and sleep in appeared as early as then, if not sooner. If I'm free to set my schedule, which has been possible at times, it's not a problem. But inevitably outside factors -- job, school, relationships, etc. -- interfere.<p>That said, I find that the night does have a certain aesthetic appeal -- a sense of freedom, of wonder even -- that I find absent in the cold, hard light of day, which likely contributes to my return to a ""night owl"" pattern when possible.",1213485599
217759,comment,213737,213943,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"The problem with a direct downvote mechanism is tuning it properly.  If it's too weak then it won't do much good and if it's too powerful then it could potentially do harm.<p>I think a better idea would be to allow the editors or leaders to have some way to enable the story downvote button for the rest of the community.

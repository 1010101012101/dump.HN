He is self funded, he is building on existing tools (always good advice), he leveraged us, the hacker crowd, who can be very loyal, he clearly listens to his customers etc.<p>Cuil, on the other hand, produced some very confusing (if technically interesting) things and then ranted about those who criticised them. They had  a lot of big bucks VC money (always a warning sign) and didn't appear to be leveraging loyalty from any user base.<p>Even if the problems these two startups are facing are different; there is a lesson here.

Piracy is a very difficult problem to solve and like always, porn is on the forefront of this emerging technology.  If there is a solution to it, the internet porn folks are going to find it soon.  If they don't find the solution, there is going to be a major change to the way that media is distributed online.<p>2)
The online porn industry is cannibalizing itself.  Those tube sites must cost <i>a lot</i> of money (in bandwidth costs) to run.  Other online porn companies are buying ads on those sites and some content companies are paying to have their content featured.  Why?  Seriously?  Why would advertisers pay for something they know will continue to degrade the industry as a whole?  I understand that organizing something like this would be tough, but if all of the people stopped buying ads on the tube sites, they would be gone in a month.<p>3)
Advertising income is down all over the web and no one (porn or not) is breaking new ground.  We're looking at the same ads at the same times in the same places.  Traditionally, advertising has evolved and changed so that people don't become desensitized to it.  I don't think that we're being creative enough with the way we create and place our advertising online.  Naked or not, refining the way that we present and consume ads will be an important evolution of the web.",1284806644

They're completely reliant on affiliate traffic (usually paying 60-70% revenue share), because the online porn industry is so competitive that it's extremely difficult or impossible to generate your own traffic.<p>It's gotten so bad that porn sites are now giving content to the tube sites with affiliate links, in hopes of mitigating losses.<p>When I worked at that company, I made an ""iTunes Store for porn"" that did very well on launch, selling full non-DRM scenes for $1.99 each [1]. We even had companies like Hustler, Vivid, and Playboy desperately wanting to get their content into it (they're great at selling DVDs but never quite got the hang of online porn). Unfortunately, I never got the marketing support or budget I needed to keep it going, and the management wanted to keep it exclusive to our brand, so it died off pretty quickly.<p>It's a shame, I think it could have completely revitalized a struggling industry (""The only way to control your content is to be the best provider of it"").

  10 years ago, I was a happy user of Microsoft products and could not see any reason to use anything else.  I never minded paying for software.  I still don't mind, although now, all of the software I use is free(legally free).  I don't even allow Microsoft software on my network, because I don't trust it.  What drove me away from Microsoft was a steady history of the company lying to me and treating it's customers with contempt.  Sometimes I hear that Microsoft has gotten better, but many things, including recently the behavior concerning Microsoft Office XML shows me otherwise.  I disliked Linux when I started with it, but I did not appreciate paying money to be treated like dirt and I forced myself to convert.  I think I understand the economic forces that drove Microsoft, but I think you were too short sighted.  You looked on consumers as people who had little choice but to knuckle under to you.  No consumer wants the DRM you crippled Windows Vista and 7 with.  No sensible company wants an unreliable OS, which is all you offer now.  I have discussed the unreliable nature of Windows with several senior MS engineers and they almost all agree about my points.  One senior designer did not, although he could never find and deliver to me the evidence he though he had to the contrary.
  I am more productive now with Linux than I ever was with Microsoft products, and I feel much better about it, too.
 It seems to me that Microsoft is on it's way to irrelevance and I think there is very little chance you will reform.  You think the actions you take are defensible.  Most of them are, but that is not the only standard that matters.  I feel dirty when I have to use Microsoft products now and that is 100 percent driven by your choices.  I convert people to Linux every month.  I still have an open mind, but I would need to see a real difference at Microsoft to change my mind.
Thank you for asking.",1284804193

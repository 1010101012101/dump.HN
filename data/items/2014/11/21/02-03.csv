It covers the base of users quite well.<p>But lets say you are building a highly specialized application.  You are going to be making quite a few customizations which are far more manageable through a shell scripting environment than by customizing a bunch of binaries.<p>I assume that Redhat is going to cover a lot of the bases for most users out there.  But for those of us in highly customized environments it&#x27;s going to suck.",1416538794

It&#x27;s not zero then suddenly $$$$. It&#x27;s more a question of gradual, usually low cost, equipment upgrades. All backhaul is via fiber optics, so by switching optics you go from 1G/10G/100G to multiple 1G/10G/100G waves. You might need a new router blade or a bigger chassis at some point.<p>Only if you really messed up do you need infrastructure upgrades. This might mean splitting nodes, i.e. pulling a bit more fiber to hotspots, but that is why you have spare empty conduits and excess fiber strands in your cables. If you don&#x27;t then you truly deserve all the misery you brought upon yourself.",1416538740

8639560,comment,8639362,8639362,0,0,marcosscriven,,,"I&#x27;m not an asm.js expert by anyway means, but I did have some success using it. So here&#x27;s some basic facts:<p>1) asm.js <i>is</i> Javascript, albeit a strict subset<p>2) asm.js is not Emscripten. Emscripten is rather a tool that converts LLVM IR to asm.js - in fact, before asm.js was released, Emscripten still worked, albeit significantly slower.<p>3) While you can&#x27;t &#x27;compile&#x27; Javascript to asm.js, you could in theory manually convert it - the reason it&#x27;s so closely associated with C/C++ is that there&#x27;s type information available to do the conversion to asm.js automatically<p>4) Just as an example, asm.js works by doing things like bitwise ORing numbers with zero to make it possible for the Javascript engine to immediately know you&#x27;re actually only dealing with integers. In that sense it gives you AOT-like potential, rather than running the loop a few hundred times to see what you&#x27;re getting before JITing it.<p>With V8, Google seem to be taking the approach it&#x27;s better to optimise more generally, rather than focussing on asm.js.",1416538489

8639556,comment,8637150,8637856,0,0,stephencanon,,,"> Modern languages and their compilers can usually produce the best possible machine code most of the time.<p>You have been lied to.  Modern compilers produce better code than non-expert assembly programmers.  Expert assembly programmers are still much, much better than compilers (note, however, that we are also much more expensive).  As a professional library writer, I typically beat compilers by about 2x for non-trivial non-vectorizable functions; when vectorization is possible, that figure usually increases; now and then I beat a compiler by a few orders of magnitude.<p>ARM isn&#x27;t really simpler than x86.  ARMv7 has about as many instructions as x86, and probably has more if you differentiate between thumb and arm (which you should if you are micro-optimizing).  It also features some constructs like general conditional execution that are notoriously difficult for compilers to use effectively.  The 64-bit ARM ISA is every bit as complex as modern x86_64 (though more orthogonal, which makes it lovely to program for).<p>N.B. &quot;the best possible machine code&quot; is actually non-computable in the general case -- its equivalent to the halting problem.  This is sometimes referred to as the &quot;full employment theorem&quot;.  So from a certain point of view, no matter how good compilers get there will always be room to do better.",1416538375

The essay seems to exclude immigrant foods (fresh bok choi for Chinese dishes), regional foods (like Southern dishes with collard greens), etc. That&#x27;s why I argue that it isn&#x27;t representative of the 1950s, but only representative perhaps of the most culturally influential social groups of that era .. and the OP may also be a member of that group.",1416538204

As per their agreements would make them pay to Level 3 for the difference.<p>Because of that they prefer to simply throttle incoming traffic from L3, despite the fact that it is the traffic requested by their own users, they also refuse to peer directly with Netflix because Netflix also competes with their services as a cable companies.",1416537990

Different people can now openly have different moralities, different POV have come to be tolerated and the law and society has changed in its view of sexual orientation and marriage.

There is so much &quot;junk&quot; food now because people produce and actually consume it. Arguying that we&#x27;ve become more morally concerned about food when literally thousands of tons of generic food is produced and eaten everyday is also delusional.

There&#x27;s no way a bourgeois would eat the same food as a farmer, and with choice comes educated behaviors, preferences and opinions.

If you press Cmd-, to invoke the Preferences dialog, it interprets this as both Cmd-, and Cmd-W, so it brings up the Preferences dialog <i>and</i> closes the current file.",1416536848

It&#x27;s very difficult for normal customers to understand how much data they&#x27;re going to use.\nWhen choosing a phone data plan, my dad asked me what plan to go for. How much does google maps use? No idea..<p>Also, extremely difficult for the customer to dispute the particular data usage, because they don&#x27;t have access to the audit data that comcast has, and they don&#x27;t have the technical skill to determine that they really accessed &quot;turnerhd-f.akamaihd.net&quot; when visiting cnn.com anyway.

In most industries, if you get more, you pay incrementally less.  If I buy a hamburger, soda and fries, I get a discount on the price. If I buy 1000 widgets I get a better price than 10 of them. Comcast and the telcos turn this on its head by charging penalties for overages.<p>Regulators could force carriers to pro-rate based on the price you paid for your service. For example:<p>ISP offers 3 packages:\n100 GB for $10/mo  (overages charged at $0.10/gb) \n300 GB for $20/mo  (overages charged at $0.06/gb)\n750 GB for $30/mo  (overages charged at $0.04/gb)\n2000 GB for $40/mo (overages charged at $0.02/gb)<p>EVEN better, offer automatic price brackets...  Why make people worry about choosing the right plan. People don&#x27;t want to make this decision.<p>First 10GB: $0.10/gb\nNext 20GB: $0.07/gb\nNext 50GB: $0.05/gb\neach GB after that: $0.02/gb<p>(for illustrative purposes only..

Another example is Mary Shapiro, former head of the SEC, who now works for Promontory Financial (along with dozens of former regulators) providing consulting services and regulatory advice for the private sector.

A few examples:<p><pre><code>  * Dart is very toolable and has a great IDE experience in a number of IDEs already: IntelliJ/WebStorm, Eclipse, the Dart Editor, Sublime, etc.\n  * The semantics are much more sane and predictable than JavaScript: objects are closed; Dart has class-based inheritance with interfaces and mixins; type coercion is eliminated and thus predictable; arrays are real arrays, bound checked and can&#x27;t have holes; &#x27;this&#x27; is lexically bound; accessing a undefined property throws an exception rather than propagating undefined through your program; there are no top-level statements, so startup is predictable; and on and on...\n  * Dart&#x27;s syntax combined with interfaces allow for really great libraries, and Dart&#x27;s core libraries and dart:html take full advantage of that. [] is separate from property access, so Lists, Maps, and Sets have nice-to-use interfaces. There can be multiple implementations of List, Map, etc. It&#x27;s possible to write delegate/wrapper/proxy classes, etc. Dart&#x27;s core libraries are a joy to use.\n  * Static type warnings and checked mode helps developers write correct programs. Type checks really do find errors early and save users time. We see this internally.\n</code></pre>\nThe syntax is much lighter weight than Java. While people claim it&#x27;s Java-like just because we have types (though they&#x27;re optional), that&#x27;s really a nonsensical argument - Dart&#x27;s more like Smalltalk :) Dart programs are massively less verbose than Java, and I cringe every time I have to write Java code even a little.<p>So we&#x27;re seeing increased usage internally even though the VM isn&#x27;t in Chrome yet. The other advantages are huge and have enabled teams to deliver new apps at very fast rates. They&#x27;re mostly internal for now, but we&#x27;ll hopefully see more externally visible apps soon. Also, we&#x27;ve just begun the era of server-side Dart in earnest. That&#x27;s a big area for expansion that will feedback on the web usage.",1416536025

It seems to follow the &quot;logic of science&quot; approach from Jaynes. Hypothesis testing is covered in chapters 4 and 6. Other books (Mackay, Jaynes, Murphy) only cover frequentist hypothesis testing to argue against it, so this is rather refreshing.",1416535799

Saying no to Windows means being able to say yes, more, to Linux. Saying no to meetings means saying yes to writing a new feature or fixing a bug. Saying no to interruptions means saying yes to focus. And so on.<p>You have only so much time in the day, week, year, rest of your life.

It reminded me of that Asimov essay [1] that talks about the English Lit student who wrote him a letter quoted Socrates to him, &quot;it is because I alone know that I know nothing&quot; and implied that there is no advancement in our knowledge when we thought the Earth was flat and we were wrong, and our modern understanding that the Earth is round and we are wrong (since it&#x27;s not perfectly round). The upshot was that Asimov was foolish in thinking he knew something. The author of this essay seems to imply a similar idea.<p>By passing off the moralities as a fad, the author seems utterly clueless of the fact that when more people have pre-marital sex, no one is harmed, but when people raise millions of animals to be eaten, there is a victim (the animal).<p>[1] <a href=""http://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/RelativityofWrong.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/RelativityofWrong.htm</a>",1416535331

8639403,story,,,4,4,marcosscriven,"Ask HN: What's the state of the art in multi-platform client GUI development?",,"It seems to me that there&#x27;s plenty of good options for writing everything but the GUI of client apps in a cross-platform manner. Just for example, one could write the meat of an app in C++, and it could be compiled to OS X, Linux, Windows, iOS and Android. With Emscripten one can even run it in a browser surprisingly well.<p>However, the GUI side of things seems to be split into three (let me know if I&#x27;ve missed a category):<p>1) Native to the OS (That&#x27;s to say, using OS-provided widgets and idiomatic HIG)\n2) HTML/CSS based (E.g. React in a Chromium environment)\n3) Some kind of cross-platform widgets (E.g Java Swing/AWT, QT, even OpenGL)<p>I think the first option seems to be the most favoured, but option 2 still seems attractive to me (as a dev), given how well Spotify and Atom seem to work. Option 3, while practical for some applications, seems to be generally derided to the point of contempt.<p>I do wonder how much of how well option 2 performs is down to implementation, rather than a fundamental limitation of its approach. For instance, before Atom moved to using React, it was dreadfully slow to scroll.<p>Another way to phrase it is, what multi-platform apps do you admire, and what tech stack do they use? I&#x27;m particularly interested in excellent examples of cross-platform GUIs (Be they HTML/CSS or otherwise)",1416535205

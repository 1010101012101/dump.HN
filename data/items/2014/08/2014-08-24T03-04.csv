For that matter &quot;Loading...&quot; seems a bit odd too. This honestly looks like satire but I don&#x27;t think it was intended to be so.<p>That aside to leave a real comment: I&#x27;m really pleased to see how simple the code is for these apps. I wasn&#x27;t aware they could be written with Javascript. It seems more and more people are turning to JS as the scripting languages for most abstractions, i.e. google spreadsheets coding is in JS. Microsoft native apps are in JS. Pebble etc.. I wonder if Pebble is actually running V8 in the background or what they do.<p>Regardless good work!<p>Consider removing the error and loading screens from your presentation of the app. As well as fixing the consistency of the indentation in your code.

Blackstone in his Commentaries alluded to this right to rebel as the natural right of resistance and self preservation, to be used only as a last resort, exercisable when &quot;the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression&quot;.[71] Some believe that the framers of the Bill of Rights sought to balance not just political power, but also military power, between the people, the states and the nation,[72] as Alexander Hamilton explained in 1788:<p>[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude[,] that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.[72][73]<p>=======<p>If you accept above interpretation, why don&#x27;t local police have nuclear weapons?

Although quite a feat in itself Cython is not a very sophisticated compiler, so if you are writing C code you are better of taking charge and writing the C yourself. You get to enjoy the tooling that have accumulated over the years around the C syntax language. Otherwise you often get yourself in a solution that you have to debug the autogenerated C, not very pleasant. The second reason is that the bridge between Cython and C is by no means cheap. Note Cython&#x27;s objective is to produce a Python C modules, not native C binaries, so it will talk to see with all the disadvantages of talking to C from a Python C module. Cython is indeed great if you have legacy code in Python that you would want to marry to C, or to get some speedup with minimal intervention, but if you are not so constrained and want more speedup than this affords perhaps better approaches are needed.<p>I would also point out that Julia does not always yield faster solutions than Cython yet. My main motivation was to point out some design issues that you are saddled with when you are a denizen in the Python world.",1408850522

8217550,comment,8216958,8216958,6,0,wisty,,,"> In the last 20 years, the economic surge of Asia, especially China, has brought a large trade readjustment to the world, one with few parallels with the possible exception of the rise of the Western economies several centuries ago. China’s per capita income, less than $300 in 1984, is now in the range of $10,000. The country is now the world’s second-largest economy, and becoming the largest by one measure.<p>> Who are some of the possible losers in this radical transformation in the global economy?<p>To be honest, we already know who the losers were. Median wages in the US didn&#x27;t budge for 30 years, as manufacturing went downhill. Now that China is more or less industrialised, and Chinese wages are pushing up, US manufacturing is coming back.<p>The 2007+ recession wasn&#x27;t about China taking the jobs. It was a credit crunch which wasn&#x27;t really connected to anything China did, and should go away once the bad debt is all cleared.<p>You could argue that India&#x27;s deindustrialisation created a path-dependent problem. It couldn&#x27;t grow, because it had locked into a bunch of institutions that were anti-industry. But I suspect the British also helped forge those dodgy institutions. India was saddled with institutions which were designed for a richer country (risk adverse), then modified to be extractive (sending wealth back to Britain), and without the need for industry (both because India didn&#x27;t have the industry, and Britain didn&#x27;t want them to have it). It was a triple whammy, and it was kept in place for quite some time. Add in the inevitable costs of a revolution (and subsequent sectarian violence), and it&#x27;s not too surprising that India has had a rough time.<p>The EU can probably survive a few decades of deindustrialisation with less issues, though the EU is a mixed blessing.",1408849791

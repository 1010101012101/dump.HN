If you use it like it&#x27;s Haskell, it has a cognitive load that&#x27;s as bad as Haskell (or worse). And if you inherit a codebase from someone else, you can bet they&#x27;ve been tempted to be oh-so-clever. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d never let Scala near production.<p>Go has almost no cognitive load beyond the complexity of the algorithm itself.",1376909919

6236486,comment,6233646,6234592,4,0,randomsearch,,,"I suspect it is actually quite straightforward. After 9/11, security services were given free reign to do whatever they thought necessary to prevent a similar atrocity. Many laws were passed that would never have been considered if 9/11 had not occurred. I don&#x27;t believe most politicians were taking advantage of the situation, rather they were threatened and scared by what happened and over-reacted.<p>The recent PRISM scandal has exposed the results of this short-term and irrational behaviour, and now the UK and US governments are embarrassed and angry. Either they regret their surveillance of their own citizens, or else they still believe in it and are angry at the revelation. So rather than repair the situation, they&#x27;re making it worse.<p>The final component is that extraordinary powers will always be abused, eventually. And this is probably what we have seen here.<p>I don&#x27;t believe in any huge conspiracy, just a political elite that is often incompetent, and (particularly in the UK) stuck in the past.<p>It now feels impossible to criticise other countries for their appalling human rights records. We don&#x27;t respect democracy or freedom, so how can we ever argue in its defence? The Western powers should be the torchbearers for democracy, not those trampling on it.<p>I think the solution is more whistle-blowing until we achieve sufficient transparency from the states involved and ethical behaviour from the security services. The EU is also already doing a great job of criticising the US and UK, and hopefully that political pressure will pay off. A change of government on both sides of the atlantic (don&#x27;t hold you breath in the UK) would also provide an opportunity for progress.",1376909373

It turns out that the North Vietnamese, while evaluating battlefield losses about the time of the Tet Offensive (early 1968), performed a simple calculation and realized that the North Vietnamese birthrate was high enough that they could (and would) tolerate their losses in perpetuity and would therefore be able to continue fighting forever if necessary.<p>What I find astonishing is that no decisionmakers on the American side ever figured this out -- the U.S. military and political leadership persisted in their belief that the other side would eventually run out of young men and women to send into battle, and would therefore have to give up. A simple demographic calculation argued otherwise.<p>The above central fact about the Vietnamese War made American withdrawal inevitable, yet nearly no one in the U.S. even realizes it now -- it&#x27;s not included in most histories of the war and its central significance to the outcome isn&#x27;t widely appreciated.",1376907234

Instead of a messy chain of dozens of asynchronous callbacks spread over tens of source files, the core logic of the system fits in a couple hundred lines of code, all in the same file.&quot;<p>I think it would be quite rare to see a project of any significance at Google which didn&#x27;t have an async aspect to it. My guess is that this is particularly the case when it was decided to be written in C++ over Java or Python: speed for this project matters, and the way to get the fastest execution is a distributed C++ program.<p>When you combine that with Rob Pike&#x27;s assertion that most of the programmers moving to Go are from Python rather than C++, and you can see why rewrites are starting to gain momentum. I think there are a handful of people who truly do love C/C++, but I think most programmers (Google or no) see it as a necessary evil to meet the desired speed requirements. Now Go is stable and proven to work at Google, I can see lots of teams getting internal pressure to start trading out components from C++ to Go.

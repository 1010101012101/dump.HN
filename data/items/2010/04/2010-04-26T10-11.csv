1294562,comment,1294419,1294502,0,0,lispm,,,"Symbols are not treated more systematically in Mathematica.<p>QUOTE is a special operator in Lisp that causes the evaluator to return its argument unevaluated.<p><pre><code>     (quote a) -> a
     (quote (+ 1 2)) -> (+ 1 2)
     (quote ""abc"") -> ""abc""
</code></pre>
Mathematica has a different strategy for computation, one that is based on rewrite rules. Expressions are rewritten until they can't no longer be rewritten.<p>In Lisp evaluation<p><pre><code>    (+ a a)
</code></pre>
gives an error if the variable A has no value.<p>In Mathematica it would be reduced to<p><pre><code>   (* 2 a)  ; in Lisp syntax
</code></pre>
if A has no value.<p>But that has little to do with the processing capabilities of Lisp. A function like Take can be written very natural in Lisp - there is NO special mode needed. The function takes data and computes results.<p>You may want to get out of your Mathematica blub and learn some Lisp.
Writing the 'Take' function is a good exercise. Stuff like that are basic exercises in Lisp courses.",1272279326

Or the experienced craftsmen with expertise in their old, ugly and ""unredable"" language?<p>Personally I find it rather funny and ironic that noobs are the ones driving the language of choice because they have learned how good their new and powerful language is - and because they are having trouble reading anything else.<p>In this way the noobs get an edge over Old-timers with years of experience that actually know how to write beautiful code in their old ugly language.<p>The noobs doesn't realize this until their favourite language is considered old and obsolete by even newer noobs, and they start to call themselves Old-timers..<p>I think most people will have a native language where they express themselves better and more elegant than any other language. They will probably solve any problem faster with their native language compared to the optimally correct besserwisser language.

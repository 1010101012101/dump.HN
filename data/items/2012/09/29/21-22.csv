I'll give it this though, whether automated or manually Siri's been pretty consistently tuned to get better and better as its gone along which was likely to happen as it got a larger and larger dataset to work with.",1348955972

4591054,comment,4589554,4591019,1,0,gambler,,,"1. Right now, Gmail has only as much control over accounts as individual website developers give it. It's up to us to implement alternative password reset system and make them the default. Any website can (and in my opinion should) switch to something else at any time, because, firstly, password reset system is decoupled from core authentication mechanism and, secondly, it is under web developer's control. Mass adoption of Persona will change this problem from locally solvable to unsolvable. If this becomes <i>the</i> authentication standard (which seems to be the project's goal), you will <i>have to</i> trust user's email provider.<p>2. Right now, Gmail can reset your password, but it cannot silently authorize someone else to use your account without you knowing.

A resume should be a highlight reel of the skills/experience/qualifications of the applicant THAT PERTAIN TO THE JOB BEING APPLIED FOR.  The cover letter then explains how those skills go together and what the applicant is looking for.  Github, open source projects, web sites, examples, etc. are supporting evidence once they've gone from an unqualified lead to a qualified lead.  But that's the difference that people seem to forget, a large majority of job positions are filled from unqualified leads and spending 20 minutes per applicant with nothing indicating they even have the minimal skills necessary.",1348954680

Dynamic typing makes it difficult to ever change APIs, because a change could break anything that depends on them.  pylint and other such tools help a little bit, but they can only do so much when the language doesn't support static typing.<p>Another Python feature that makes upgrades hard is monkeypatching, where one piece of code can inject arbitrary code into another piece of code.  In many dynamic languages, this is often used to patch the behavior of core classes like String.  I don't know how common this is in Python, but I've definitely seen it before.  By erasing the distinction between interface and implementation, this makes it difficult to ever change them implementation of anything.<p>People say that writing more and more unit tests will solve these problems.  But guess what?  The more unit tests you have of an API, the more unit tests you have to change when that API changes.  Unit tests are good and should be written in any language, but they are hardly a substitute for static typing.<p>The end result of all of this is that dynamically typed languages usually follow a trajectory where there's an initial burst of enthusiasm about some cool syntax, followed by a lot of code being written, and then a gradual descent into a compatibility tarpit, where nothing can be changed because of fear of breaking working code.  Only additions can be made, and the language gradually grows uglier and uglier.  Dynamically typed languages approximate Bourne shell more and more as time goes on-- a dozen slightly incompatible implementations, ancient quirks that bite hard on newcomers, and a resignation that this is the ""best it gets.""<p>Sometimes there's a burst of irrational hope towards the end of a language's lifetime.  Perl 6 and Python 3 are good example of this.  Developers go into their happy place and forget about the big bad compatibility bear that's been chasing them.  But it's just a fantasy-- dynamic languages can't escape from the tarpit in the end, and nobody adopts the new thing.",1348953296

C & S derive (the same) set of MAC keys, crypto keys, and crypto parameters.<p>6. C & S verify every message of the handshake with the MAC keys.<p>Other useful things to know:<p>* SSL/TLS operates over a ""record layer"" of TLV-style messages. The TLS record layer itself supports fragmentation, which is a little crazy.<p>* The server can ask the client to send a certificate too; this is common on backend connections and unfortunately not common with browsers, because the UI is terrible.<p>* Less commonly, C & S can opt for a ""DHE"" (ephemeral Diffie-Hellman) key exchange, in which the RSA key from the certificate is used to sign a DH key exchange (DH allows both sides to use random public keys instead of long-term fixed keys, but suffers from exposure to MITM attacks --- the RSA key from the cert ""breaks the tie"" in a MITM situation, making the exchange secure). This has the advantage of ensuring that even if an attacker has been recording all your traffic for years, she can't compromise a server's private key and then decrypt older connections. This is called ""forward secrecy"".<p>* The two common cipher suites used on most connections are AES in CBC mode and RC4. AES-CBC chunks plaintext into 16 byte blocks, padding the last block if there are insufficient bytes to fill it. Until TLS 1.1, TLS ran CBC in a continuous stream over the whole connection, using the last block of the most recent message as the IV for the next, which gave rise to the BEAST flaw. RC4 is a stream cipher that encrypts byte-at-a-time --- but nobody trusts RC4 much.<p>* TLS 1.2 (IIRC) introduces AES-CTR, which runs AES as a stream cipher.",1348953057

I just wanted to make the point that it certainly appeared like Microsoft was better prepared to cope with this situation and it also seemed that it was due to a more mature internship program. I loved working for both companies and there will definitely be pro-Google posts in the future :-)",1214377132

227266,comment,227216,227216,0,0,cperciva,,,"To quote BSD style(9): <i>Indentation is an 8 character tab. 
If you have to wrap a long statement [because it would go past the 78th column], put the operator at the end of the line.  Second level indents are four spaces.  Do not add whitespace at the end of a line, and only use tabs followed by spaces to form the indentation.  Do not use more spaces than a tab will produce and do not use spaces in front of tabs.</i><p>If you find that your code doesn't fit into 78 columns using 8-character tabs... you need to refactor your code.<p>If your editor mangles whitespace... get a better editor.",1214376605

There's not much you can predict about the rest of the world using them.<p>The cold rationality lies in the math you have to study for 2-3 years to learn how to add up these little amplitude arrows. Using that you can actually model and make predictions.<p>Another great example is Maxwell, he got all the rationalizations ""wrong"" but the math survived and is called after him.",1214375398

Tabs are non-standard across systems and of a non-unit length and so when custom continuation lines are indented, they have to use a mix which wreaks havoc when the tab length goes from 4 to say 8 or vice versa. If you are interested in re-indenting code, then use a program/command that is actually designed for code re-indentation, not some inaccurate stupid shortcut like tab length manipulation. Pretty much any modern IDE would have a code re-indentation infrastructure.",1214374298

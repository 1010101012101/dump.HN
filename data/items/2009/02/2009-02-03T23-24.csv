We weren't all morons. You better believe we figured out what works and what doesn't, and as I said, the switch to CSS-based layouts tripled the time it took to get a site to a client. If you want to believe that everyone in the shop just happened to simultaneously become mentally retarded at the exact time the switch was made, you're free to do so.

464973,comment,464342,464576,0,0,dasil003,,,"Tables were not introduced until '95.  I've been designing web pages since then and I went all CSS in 2001.  If you were doing serious design things weren't quite so rosy as the picture you paint.  Hobbyists and non-designers don't realize what designing with tables was really like.  There were crazy idiosyncrasies like whitespace affecting table layout.  The late 90s an incredible amount of effort was dumped into developing table-based layout techniques.  Tools like ImageReady evolved to make slicing images easy, but the underlying code was an abomination.  Depending on your design you end up having to have tiny cells with tons of rowspan and colspan attributes or deep nesting.  Neither one of those is maintainable at all, and when you bring a template-based back-end it can get downright insane.  And once you get to those kinds of designs, things aren't nearly so predictable as some seem to think.  Try fixing the width of one column in a table and then predicting the width of each of the remaining columns.  The table cell width computation varies frustratingly between browsers and the particular content in the cell.  Even worse, this situation will never be resolved because all development effort towards advancing the state of web design is happening in CSS.  The abilities you have today are what you will have forever, except new browsers may introduce bugs.<p>The problem with this debate so far is the oversimplification of the issues.  CSS was not created to simplify a 5-cell table layout by turning it into 5-div layout. These degenerate examples aren't representative of the real-world design issues that gave rise to CSS in the first place.  It's like somebody saying PHP is a better language than Haskell because ""functional programming is confusing""--sure go for PHP if you just need to get something done, but if you are serious about the craft of programming than you need to look to the state of the art.<p>CSS is far from perfect.  But people need to have some appreciation of the facilities it brings to the table (despite imperfect browser support).  The capabilities are much richer than tables (in fact they are a superset in the spec), and designed to solve complex design issues across a range of devices and media.  This is all achieved in a human readable and editable language. Try writing postscript out by hand some time.",1233705016

464970,comment,464151,464372,0,0,derefr,,,"There are two factors.<p>First, here's an analogous question: why do people still listen to the <i>radio</i> when you can download entire discographies at the click of a button? The answer is the trait that radio and podcasts share--the DJ.<p>A DJ is, for the purpose of this comment, someone sitting there on the other end of the line, sharing music with you and thinking carefully about what to play next to maximize your enjoyment, and sometimes offering commentary in-between. People like DJs. A DJ, on a station you like, is like a friend of yours--at minimum, immersed in the same culture as you, whether by physical proximity or by interest--who can tell you about all the new and great music they've been listening to, except that <i>that's their whole job</i>, so A: they're really very good at it, and B: you can ignore them sometimes when you don't like what they're saying without upsetting them. The station, in some ways, <i>is</i> the DJ.<p>Television stations are their programming. Even if the commentary isn't there (though wouldn't it be interesting if it was? a station with a live impressario, critically evaluating the progress of a show on the breaks while the advertisements rolled in a sidebar?), the playlist-y-ness <i>is</i> there, which is what's important. Playlistyness is what's making it hard to win the Netflix prize: there's something a DJ knows about their audience that lets them recommend certain otherwise-controversial choices, that the Netflix algorithms and the iTunes Genius and so on just can't manage. (In my opinion, it's likely the ability to take a real, human stance on a divisive piece of media that actually pushes the division in one direction or another, and that's something machines will never be able to do, at least until some time after they get suffrage.)<p>Now, the second factor: why do some people like Internet radio and <i>not</i> podcasts? Internet radio is <i>live</i> and <i>source-ubiquitous</i>. Live in that, like radio and television, things can happen on the stream <i>as they happen</i> in reality: there can be news reports, interviews, call-in shows, and so on. Clothes can malfunction. This feels real.<p>Some television shows are live, obviously. Beyond that, the programming choices usually don't feel live, but the <i>ads</i> do--whatever ads air are always part of a corporation's newest marketing strategy, which is, if they're doing their job, 100% pure current-and-targeted pop-culture. Thus, you can look at an advertisement (in any content-digest medium, such as a magazine) and immediately feel immersed in the culture and time which created it, which, if it's the present, makes it feel more ""live."" (Magazine ads, though, are designed to culture-decay more gracefully precisely because magazines lay about in places like waiting rooms for so long. You don't want to <i>disturb</i> people by immersing them in a foreign (or even just old) ""live"", so you back off on the feeling a bit.)<p>Source-ubiquity is just the concept that, when you turn on your TV and I turn on my TV, they have the same things available (unlike, say, your iPod and my iPod), and more importantly, we can find the same thing at the same time (assuming we live in the same timezone), <i>regardless of our intention to do that</i>. Couples can watch TV together over the telephone, without it occurring to them that they're doing so. The important part is that this doesn't require any special synchronization--you don't have to say ""1, 2, 3, press play"", or get a group over for football; you only have to turn on your sets and flip around a bit. Your friends (who you assumably share interests with) will <i>anneal</i> to the same channel as you, and then be fed the same program.<p>""Every household in America was listening to the president's inaugural address"" is a powerful statement: everyone, sitting around in their houses, was in one virtual place at the same time. I can't imagine any event that would cause everyone on (or even a large chunk of) the Internet to go to the same site at the same time; the nearest we have here are Alternate Reality Games, where planned ""events"" (such as characters appearing in chatrooms, or websites being altered) happen as parts of a continuing story.<p>""The Evening News"" is the purest form of source-ubiquity: the idea of ""the News"" is that there are a certain number of facts that you can rely on other people to be statistically likely to be aware of, <i>because</i> they are ""news""; they are news because they were put into a source-ubiquitous medium at a time when a lot of people were watching. You watch the News to find out not what's important to your own life (if you've important news, someone you actally know will tell you soon enough), but what's important to the ""live""--the current culture, weighted inversely proportionally to the square of time. (You can picture journalists riding a moving ""live"" hyperbola like a wave if you like.)<p>Now a digression, that I'll justify in a moment: pop culture in general, but celebrity culture in particular, are important, because they give people some way to relate to strangers who might be very foreign to them. Celebrity evolved out of our desire to continue to gossip about things as we moved out of farmland and into dense cities, where the stranger on the corner won't know your neighbours. They <i>will</i> know about which movie star had what rapper's baby, and so you talk about that--and so you <i>read</i> about that. Entertainment Tonight is, if you can imagine it, an existential battlefront in the war against meaninglessness in the face of population explosion.<p>""Live"", together with source-ubiquity, encourage celebrity. You can talk to the stranger on the corner about what you saw ""at seven last night,"" and they'll know what you mean. You can gossip about fictional characters as if they were real people, precisely because you know that everyone around you gets the same cable package.<p>Television is integral to our culture today. If we truly do abandon it, not individually but as a culture, we'll need to create something that works like it <i>within</i> our new, peer-to-peer reality, or we'll lose all these benefits. ""Web communities"" are a step towards source-ubiquity. Podcasts are playlist-y. And the main benefit of ""Web 2.0"" was, I think, to make most of the web feel ""live."" However, I think there are very few sites or applications, currently, that capture all three benefits the way television and radio do. That's definitely a market opportunity, though probably not just yet ;)<p>> Watching shows in just one room, wired to a wall<p>Those <i>are</i> legacy, though. Let's hope those go away in the redesign.",1233704863

The argument generally centers around valid, web-tested, academic-approved CSS layouts being practical for use in the real world. I worked with someone who did freelance web design on the side and who said ""I program for Opera and only test in Opera."" Does anyone really need to wonder why he didn't have any repeat business?<p>I also worked in a slicing sweatshop, and using CSS to do layouts instead of tables <i>tripled</i> the amount of time it took to slice a PSD mockup. Department-wide adoption of the YUI CSS framework brought this down to maybe double, although YUI still has some of the basic layout issues that CSS itself does (eg the lead engineer on YUI CSS told me himself that the only way they know of to solve the equal-height column issue with YUI is using Javascript, and there is no equal-height column CSS hack that's anywhere near to understand or cross-browser compatible as table-tr-td-td-td). The greatest time sinkhole by FAR was CSS layout debugging. It was not infrequent to have someone's whole day go down the drain struggling with some god-awful cross-browser issue that would be relatively easy using tables for layout. So I've been there, to the point where I know that the only CSS books that aren't nearly completely worthless are _CSS Mastery_, _Bulletproof Web Design_, and maybe O'Reilly's Definitive Guide.<p>Doing a layout in perfect, valid CSS separating presentation from content (as much as possible, because I've never seen them successfully completely separated in a non-trivial project) is sort of like writing a book and having a sticker on the cover that says ""This book has been validated 100% grammatically correct."" Swell, but it really doesn't have anything to do with the price of spinach.<p>Just like how the fact that many people have a beef with using CSS for layouts doesn't negate the fact that for everything else it eliminates redundancies and is generally the cat's pajamas, the fact that tables look ugly doesn't negate the fact that in many cases they Just Work faster and are easier to understand than CSS for standard layouts like three equal-height columns.",1233702832

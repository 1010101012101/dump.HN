It's not about racism - it's more as if a shared group identity encouraged cooperative behaviour.<p>Even weirder - there seems to be a trigger effect : until the non visible minority reaches 5% the cooperative behaviour keeps working.<p>Funny thing - it seems to works even if you account your own ethnicity - i.e. when you are in the <5% you will get more cooperation by people with a different ethnicity than you !!<p>Cross the 5% mark and it won't work as well - apparently even with people of the same ethnicity as you. Weird.<p>Some may call that parochialism.

5265532,comment,5264219,5265272,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">Doesn't fusion demand constant refueling (like most power plants)?<p>I don't think the half-life of deuterium/tritium is particularly long, so even if you could store it, it might not last decades before use. Though on the other hand, it's conceivable that you could design the reactor so that it produces deuterium/tritium on site from hydrogen cracked from seawater.<p>But realistically the reason we want fusion over fission in the first place is the proliferation concern. All of the other arguments against fission are NIMBY nonsense that could be applied equally to a whole swathe of chemical processing facilities that nobody seems to care anything about because they're not <i>OMG nukular</i>. And there is hardly a major proliferation risk from a reactor surrounded by military personnel on a vessel designed to securely carry actual nuclear bombs, so it makes the specifically military application kind of questionable.<p>We really need fusion for two reasons. 1) There is a better chance that we can actually build a large number of reactors without roving gangs of idiots destroying their cost effectiveness with gratuitous and intentional red tape, and 2) we can build them in countries we don't trust without making it easier for them to blow up the world, which will help to fight global warming vs. those countries continuing to burn oil and coal.",1361555714

If requests have fixed and high memory latency, the four CPU's will get back four times as many results in each waiting period as the single CPU. This presupposes that the problem has enough memory parallelism to support four memory requests in flight at once.<p>But if the problem is highly memory parallel, then the faster CPU can take advantage of that memory parallelism just as easily. It doesn't have to only issue one request at a time, then wait until it is fulfilled. It can shoot off four requests at a time and wait for them all to come in. Indeed, ""brawny"" CPU's tend to also have ""brawny"" memory controllers that can support more simultaneous requests.",1361555653

No true parallelism due to runtime limitations (single runtime lock)<p>I've thought about this, and it's not a big deal in the multicore/SMP sense. For I/O concurrency, there is LWT or Async. It does fall short for ""small-scale"" parallelism though, eg map-reduce over an array, multiplying big-but-not-huge matrices, etc. At least OCaml doesn't pretend to support threading, unlike most other GIL-bound languages.<p>For high-concurrency or large parallel problems, multiple processes are a better option since that naturally scales beyond a single machine. OCaml's memory footprint is easily an order of magnitude smaller than eg, Ruby's, so I could run 10x the number of workers using the same resources. And then they'd complete tasks faster, thanks to excellent single-thread performance.<p>In some sense, OCaml indirectly enables the best of the Unix tool tradition. The maintainers haven't tried to throw the kitchen sink at the language, which practically encourages composable designs where distributed/parallel systems are concerned.",1361555316

Currently it is very adhoc.<p>If you understand how science work beyond press releases, you'll know that the fraud and abuses will always be in the system.

There is simply no economic incentive for a speedy process. If you read retractionwath.com often you'll notice that the current system is simply not regulating itself.<p>Open post publication peer review is a way to perform that function.

Don't pretend they aren't that nosy, because they are.<p>Also, for those with AdWords accounts, the employees on that team (and maybe others) can look through all your data at any time. Maybe things have changed, but they can log into any AdWords account using their internal system, and what they will see will be exactly what you see when you log in, and more. And to cover it up, they usually point the hostility of blame for unethical behavior at someone, then react in an extreme fashion to make it seem as though they treat privacy seriously, then turn around and continue doing exactly what they were doing in the first place.<p>This same idea is true for almost every other company. They pretend as though your data is private and as though they aren't sticking their nose into or selling your information, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. They sell everything, and they are always looking for ways to tie everything about you together, especially if you are an employee there, so they can hold it over your head and pretend everything they then say is true, because ""they have the data to back it up.""<p>It doesn't take much effort or a great stretch of the imagination to realize this is happening once you see what these people look like, or once you see what these people are like. It's so easy to tell when someone is full of it, that just taking one look at these people will clue you into the fact that they are guilty on all charges.<p>And when I talk spying, I'm not talking tying information together while not linking it to someone's identity, or tying information together, but using automation to do it so that a human being can't jump in and snoop around in someone's business.

Nothing well-intentioned, though obviously even if they meant well what they are doing is still shady and wrong.<p>Don't underestimate how nosy these people are. Just think back to the nosy gossiping bitch from high school, or think about your nosy next door neighbor. That's what they are like. And they can't breathe properly until they know everything about everyone. But then they have to cover up their bullshit, as they do in every other arena of life, by being loudly and strongly opposed to all spying, snooping, or misuse of data, and by dealing aggressively with anyone misusing data, as long as it's not them. They especially like reacting aggressively to these situations when the person accused hasn't done a damn thing, as they get to screw over someone innocent (they really get off on doing that), while making themselves look good, and while, in their minds, making it impossible for you to realize that they are the guilty ones (""these idiots are dumb enough to think I'm on their side when I'm the one doing it to them, haha, they are so stupid"").

It doesn't seem economically reasonable, at least not until food is an order of magnitude more expensive than now.<p>We pull out ~30 cubic km of water from the Ogallala Aquifer per year. Let's estimate how much power is needed to replace this with seawater.<p>At 2780 J/liter, this requires about 3 gigawatts, assuming perfect efficiency. Realistically it's more like 15 GW. Okay, that's doable. The US generates about 1TW of electric power, so 1% would go to desalinization.<p>Next, you need to pump it to the midwest. The second Los Angeles Aqueduct cost $90 million in 1965 dollars to carry water 137 miles. That's about $500 million in 2013 dollars. The entire Aqueduct transports about 0.4 cubic kilometers of water per year. You'll need about 10x the length to get from the Gulf to the aquifer, and 8x the volume. You'll also need a distribution network, which is likely another 4x to the cost, and you'll need to pump it uphill, which means there's more expensive upkeep.<p>This sets a low estimate of 300*$5 billion = $1.50 trillion in construction costs, and that's deliberately low-balling the estimate. The Ogallala produces about $20 billion in agriculture each year. I don't think it's financially reasonable.<p>Also, where do you dump the brine with all of the salt that you've extracted? Back into the Gulf? That's going to seriously affect the marine life. Or do you fully dry out the salt and use it in place of salt mining? I calculate this as 1 gigaton of salt/year, or about 5x the current world production of salt.<p>Even with free power, it doesn't seem that desalinization could replace the supply that we currently get from the Ogallala Aquifer. At least, not without having much higher food prices.<p>Instead, you'll have to relocate farming to some place closer to the sea which is also water restricted. In the US, this is ... where? More of the Central Valley? Where is the Nebraska-sized chunk of land by the coast that lacks only water in order to flourish?<p>Or we import more food from Australia, which seems the prime candidate for this approach.",1361554207

TL;DR: it sucks being here on visa. Even if I want to be a US-citizen and I contribute like a US-citizen, they still make sure I'm just a second-class in here.<p>I am a F-1 Visa Vietnamese student that recently got a pretty good offer in a big corp. I am really tired of being treated like half-resident person. While I do all of my duty (paying taxes), I never receive the benefits of being an resident.
First there was a out-of-state tuition for every public university in the US. For over 5 years in school, I've seen many of my friends run out of money because of this ""premium"" price we pay.<p>Now, some of us try to work to support our premium tuition, but we are not permitted to work outside of school. As a result, most of us would have to work illegally in some Asian restaurant, usually with under-minimal wage and no tips. I understand they stop us from getting a job to protect American. However, from what I observe, those minimal-wage jobs which could not be taken by international students will be taken by illegal immigrant anyway. So it puts the US government in a lose-lose situation: those jobs won't return to American citizen, and they lose some of the taxes. Maybe they should look at others country, such as UK (allowed to work up to 20h), or Australia(allowed to work in controlled manner)... and rethink.<p>The only way you can work, is to get a job in your college with minimal wage or to get an OPT. I've had a job on campus in which I design a website for dorm using bottle.py and backbone.js for... $9.5/hour. Before tax. An OPT is a program where you can work outside of your college for one year, but the job has to fit your major. I got my internship with EMC by OPT.<p>Now, although we do not have the benefits of being residents, we still have to do our duty while we are in here. I have to pay taxes like everyone else. I just finish doing my tax for last year. With one internship and an on-campus job, I fall in the second braket of tax, although I did pay a lot more for my education. We also do not have credit cards as no-one trusts us. I just got my frist creditcard after 6 years being here :).<p>Now, after 6 years of suffering, it finally pays off for me to have a offer for a big corp and be an h1-b visa. I can asure you that they pay me very competitively. However, it is still pretty damn hard to become a US-citizen from here. The process is lengthy, and sometime depends on luck. Not to mention if I want to bring my wife to the US, my wife will not be able to work at any form, not even on college campus.",1361553929

The compiler's error messages are exceptionally good in most cases.<p>Syntax errors without detail are a product of the parsing technology: its a minor irritant and worst.<p>The most difficult problem (IMHO) comes from type inference when a type inferred from context is not the one intended, but a conflict is not discovered until code with the intended typing is found: the error reflects the second location which is confusing because there is no error at that point. Of course this doesn't occur if you actually provide type annotations, so it is merely a cost of being able to omit them.<p>The excess exception handling is a reasonable comment, however it is easy to wrap the exception throwing code in a variant to enforce local error checking, and in any case this style is a property of the library, not the core language.<p>The type polymorphism in Ocaml is anything but clunky: for basic stuff you don't even need any type annotations. The thing is that Set us NOT type polymorphism. Its module polymorphic, and that requires explicit binding of an instance. There is a simple enough reason: module functors take non-type arguments, particularly function closures, which are values, which do not have unique signatures, so implicit instantiation is not possible.<p>Ocaml does have some other serious disadvantages. One is that because of the way the optimiser uses information from compiles on which it depends, there are annoying constraints on build order. In addition, recursion cannot span compilation boundaries which is pretty lame for a functional programming language: even C has no problem with that.<p>Finally, the political situation is probably the biggest problem. The development team is excellent but limited and their focus is on the type system, rather than libraries. Because the community is modest compared to say C++, many attempts to make extended libraries have failed to gain acceptance, because no one wants to depend on an unresourced third party library and the core INRIA team doesn't have the resources or interest to extend the standard distribution.<p>Despite these difficulties .. I would never want to go back to writing C++ (OMG .. the pain!). As a language .. Ocaml is light years ahead.",1361553759

If any insecurity is involved, it's about ability to ace unrepresentative tests ranging from trivial nonsense to outright hazing.<p>You advise readers to ""just get better at [the tests]"". That's practical. But it goes right back to the problem, that many of the tests mostly index whether you prepared for that test.<p>Everyone talks about how many applicants are terrible at programming, or how many employees are mediocre. But at least offline, we rarely mention the complementary problem, that many companies are terrible at interviewing and hiring.<p>We talk as if being on the other side of that desk, in a position of power, means you are automatically good at interviewing. It isn't so. When a company treats candidates abusively - or takes bad hires who are extra slick, cheap, submissive, or similar to themselves - that isn't because of  bad applicants.

When we moved to Minnesota a year after we were married over in Taiwan, she then got BIG TIME acquainted with snow, as we moved in February (about twenty-eight years ago today, now that I think of it).<p>Our four children all pile outside in Minnesota winter weather with very minimal clothing on--indoor wear even when there is snow on the ground, and light jackets even when the temperature is well below freezing. My wife spent years being horrified at seeing her half-Taiwanese children going out lightly dressed in temperatures that were unimaginable to her when she was growing up, while I just smiled and said, ""Our children are just reflecting their Norwegian ancestry."" Today we've all learned to deal with the cold.<p>My wife and I had a very enjoyable walk to the public library (one mile out, one mile back) yesterday, and I reflected that she has proved her adaptability by living so much of her life in weather that she never experienced at all in childhood. Personally, my second stay in Taiwan (1998-2001) seems to have permanently reset my body's thermostat, so much so that I NEVER feel hot anywhere in the United States, but now feel cold from time to time during winter in Minnesota. I'm probably more adapted to Taipei's semitropical climate now. But whatever the weather trade-offs, it's a delight to be outdoors, and I encourage our children and myself to get out of the house every day, in all seasons, wherever we live. When we do that, we have the children WITH us, because we want them to experience the different sights and sounds as we are on the move. I have not tried what the interesting submitted article specifically mentions, leaving a baby carriage (pram) outdoors while the baby is immobile.

I feel like I've become somewhat of an expert when it comes to interviewing processes.<p>First off, as I've become a better programmer, I feel this fact is best shown in my opinions. When I first started out, if you had asked me my opinion of PHP vs Python, I would not have been able to say anything coherent. Now that I've worked with both technologies, my opinion is much more coherent.<p>Instead of asking puzzle questions, ask candidates their opinion. ""What is your opinion of Mongodb?"" I've spent enough time in the trenches with Mongo to have quite an opinion of that technology. Same with Postgres, Django, Javascript, Coffeescript, etc.<p>I think hands down, the worse type of interview questions are the ones where you're told to solve a problem, but <i>you can only solve the problem in a certain way</i>.<p>Its become a interview idiom for me. One recently was to reverse the words in a string. In comes ""This is a string"", out comes ""string a is This"". No problem. In python this can be done with one line:<p>the_string.split()[::-1]<p>It takes me 5 seconds to write that out. The interviewer telle me ""good job"", then he asks me to do it again, but this time to do it without using any standard library functions such as split or reverse.<p>At this point, I can almost with 100% certainty that this company will be a terrible place to work. It wouldn't piss me off it it wasn't for the fact that like 90% of all interviews I do end up like this.<p>I've through about this a lot, and what I've come up with for an explanation as to why I can;t do these types of questions is because my algorithm writing process is very subconscious. When I'm writing code and I come to a problem that requires a lot of thinking, I usually stop, do something else and let the problem float around for a bit in my subconscious. I got my best ideas when I'm in the shower, on my bike riding around time, even while reading a news article. When people are watching me (especially strange people I don't even know) I don't do my best thinking. At this point I'd do anything to be able to think in front of people.

I'd much rather have someone not write a single line of code, rather than have them write 6 months of unmaintainable spaghetti code. Zero contribution is bad, but it's much worse if they have a negative multiplier on the future of the team (if what should take a day to do takes a week to do because of unmaintainable code).",1361552620

a=f(a,b)
b=g(a,b)
a=g(a,b)<p>From there you can say that works fine with pen and paper but why might it go wrong in a program? So how do you avoid integer overflow? If the signs are the same then use subtract first else use addition first. After we have done that. After this step assume I have returned to the main flow. How do I check if I should use addition or subtraction? If a is bigger than b I must have added so use subtraction. Writing the algorithm this way is trickier than xor. The problems to be solved are to do with understanding concepts<p>Next you have the xor solution but more important than getting the answer to that might be to see if they can see that the two functions are like encrypt and decrypt where a is the message and b is a key and a + b is the ciphertext c - so that f(m,k) is encrypt and g(c,k) gives the message and g(c,m) gives the key. If they have had any exposure to cryptography then xor should present itself.<p>If they give xor straight off then you can work backwards.",1361552580

5265229,comment,5264312,5264790,3,0,jnbiche,,,"May I ask where you work?  I'd love to interview at a company like yours.<p>I'm in the process of changing careers to programming in my late 30s.  I dabbled in coding on and off for most of my life, but two years ago I started taking it seriously, read K&R, etc, and completely fell in love with programming.  And so I start thinking about working full-time as a developer, and schedule an interview for a programming position for a company in the industry where I've worked for the past decade.  I've always been a confident interviewer, but I totally froze in this phone interview.  They started the interview off with a tough algorithm problem that I probably could have solved on my own in 30-40 minutes, but couldn't possibly solve on the spot in a conference call, with several people listening in and quizzing me.  From there, things went downhill quickly, and I struggled to answer questions that I could have easily answered on my own at my desk.  Since then, I've been burned on two freelance programming assignments (that I should have known better than to take given the level of desperation involved), which was quite a blow after spending a decade freelancing for dozens of clients without incident in another industry.<p>I love programming, and so I continue to code whenever I get the chance (and have two rather large projects underway), but these experiences have shaken my confidence.  If most programming jobs involve similar interview processes, I'm not sure this would be the best move for me.<p>However, this comment has given me hope.  If there are companies out there like this, then I stand a fighting chance -- I would excel at an interview where I'm given a problem, a time limit, vim, and then told to go solve it with no whiteboard or group of people watching.  Let it be a hard problem, but make it realistic -- not some obscure puzzle or algorithm -- and let me use my own tools.  I wish there were some job board where companies with this type of interview process posted jobs.",1361552519

If Adeo does his job well, he will select smart entrepreneurs. A smart crowd is a great friend to have.<p>Plus Adeo just put together a VC event, so I guess it answers your concerns about VC connections and possible ""negativity"".

502589,comment,501578,501578,0,0,moonpolysoft,,,"Sorry, but this is basically grid computing with a slightly different client.  As pointed out many times before, most interesting problems right now are IO bound.  It turns out that data locality is the most important thing in processing extremely large datasets.  That is the key insight in the map-reduce paper and the linchpin to the success or failure of all the distributed map-reduce frameworks that have sprung from it.<p>Most startups and small scale companies that would see the value in leveraging a system like this simply don't have the right processing profile which would make something like this worth their while.  I'm sure if you graphed CPU time per byte of data you'd find a sweet spot where a service like this would speed up jobs rather than slowing them down.<p>As it happens, most companies that have a high CPU time per byte ratio are either financial firms or pharma.  Most of whom not only have their own infrastructure, but would rather close up shop than see their proprietary code out in the wild for competitors to analyze.<p>And there are already plenty of clients out there for running fourier transforms on possible seti signals.",1236144921

I'm not talking about some urban legend that gets passed through 10 generations of ""friends of friends"", I'm saying that many people have had bad experiences with US Immigration, and word gets around. I personally know someone who now enters the US by land via Canada because of his repeated horrendous experiences at the air border.<p><i>""I'm not saying that Immigration and/or Homeland Security is great, but the rumor-mongering is unjustified.""</i><p>Rumours? It goes a bit beyond rumours, don't you think? It's large-scale and well-documented. Personal anecdotes alone do not make something true, but that's not the case here. The personal anecdotes just add a more of a ""this could happen to me"" dimension to otherwise abstract reports of it happening to someone else.<p><i>""And you know this because....""</i><p>Because .. it's self evident and obviously true? What are you trying to say - that the hostile suspicion of foreigners at the US Border is <i>not</i> policy?<p><i>""I know a Stanford CS PhD student who was put through hell by the Australian equivalent of US Immigration/Homeland Security""</i><p>I'm not trying to say we're much better, although at least we don't fingerprint. I have many (in some cases personally witnessed/experienced) grievances against the Australian system.<p>No need to turn this into a ""my country is better than yours"" pissing match, I have a real fondness for America and wouldn't even bother having a strong opinion if I didn't care ; )<p><i>""Nevertheless, I don't get hysterical about it.""</i><p>Sigh. I hope I didn't come across as hysterical. I put a bit of emotion into my writing in an attempt to get the point across that it's important to me, not as a sign that I have taken leave of my senses.<p><i>""I don't know how things are in Australia, but we can't identify criminals and the like without actually checking.""</i><p>Huh? We're talking about the US Border, specifically about foreigners trying to visit, many who have never been there before. Are you suggesting that there is a huge list of outstanding arrest warrants for foreign criminals whose faces and fingerprints are on record, and this system is an attempt to catch them? Or that US Border agents are cooperating with overseas police forces to catch escaping criminals or something?<p>Of course not. I actually don't know why they do it. The whole thing is post-9/11 so I suppose it's part of the ""war on terror"", but surely the number of ""terrorists"" who are on the run but whose fingerprints have somehow been recorded is vanishingly small.<p>Anyway, I hope that with the new administration in charge and the memory of 9/11 receding, this horrible system will be turned off.",1236143398

502562,comment,501696,501696,0,0,dkarl,,,"""Hacker News"" is showing its entrepreneurial, money-focused side in this discussion.  You have to be obsessed with business models to be convinced that television is ""losing"" to the internet, just like you had to be obsessed with business models to believe that the internet was ""killing music"" a few years ago.  Everybody still watches television and uses it as a cultural reference point when relating to other people.  Despite the flourishing variety of internet-native art forms, people still turn to television for a regular fix of programming.  The appetite for television programming is just another entry on the long list of things that the internet, which ""changes everything,"" isn't actually changing.<p>You can pass hours of time on YouTube, but the content, while passably stimulating, just doesn't bear repeating.  You can't crack your friends up by making some sly reference to it a month from now.  Unless, that is, you're watching something that is well-written, well-produced, and well-acted.  And in that case, you'll probably call it ""television"" to distinguish it from random thirty-second clips of some guy farting at his cat (America's Funniest Home Videos notwithstanding.)<p>When music moved from live venues to vinyl, it was still called music.  When it moved from vinyl to cassettes to CDs, it was still called music.  Now it's on the internet, and it's called... music!  Television programming has been called ""television"" or ""TV"" for over half a century.  I bet people will still call it ""television.""  We think about it as ""television versus the computer,"" but the younger generation thinks, ""Why is it so hard to find television on the internet?  I want to watch TV on my computer, not on the TV.""  That isn't contradictory at all.  That's just the way the words are used.  If you pick the right meaning of ""TV,"" then TV might die, but it isn't interesting unless you stand to make or lose money on it.  The TV that most people care about has a long life ahead of it.",1236142834

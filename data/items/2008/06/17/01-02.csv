Its just that the iPhone platform is going to be done first, so if people have apps done for that they can work on their Android stuff while they're selling on the iPhone. If you're in a crowded genre, you'll be fighting uphill for a bit, but if your idea stands on its own then take the time to do it right, no matter what platform you choose.",1213667449

If a design is making you pull your hair out, start fresh and see if you can come up with another way to contain your content while maintaining your target design. More often than not you will be able to make clean standard CSS code that is hack free and more maintainable moving forward.",1213665751

The thing is, do you really want to go that way?<p>I think that the only way that incentives are not harmful is if they're spread evenly across teams and tied to product success in the market.  Most people can grasp why the team behind a successful product is paid more.  Even then, though, you risk alienating the teams that don't do quite as well for reasons that aren't in their control.",1213664775

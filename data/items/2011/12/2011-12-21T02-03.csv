3376201,comment,3375806,3375806,2,0,JJMalina,,,"I agree. As a third year undergrad also I've noticed that the focus on the code itself has diminished to almost zero from CS 101. At least in that course my professor mentioned a few things about code quality and design like DRY, loose-coupling, etc. My data structures professor's sample code which he would give out had single capital letters as variables, single lowercase letter variables, and awful and inconsistent indentation. I understand that it's data structures and not an open source project being maintained by the professor, but there were students in the course who barely had any experience programming outside of school. My guess is that the professor's neglect for any sort of code conventions will carry over with those students.<p>My school does offer a class called ""Production Quality Software"" but it's a graduate course and if you want to take it as an undergrad you only get 3 credits.<p>IMO the situation is not good.",1324436364

For most code, you'll probably get a few warnings (since Clang's default warning set is different than GCC's). In rare occasions you'll hit an actual behavioral difference between GCC and Clang, but you'll typically only find those where you're already writing non-standards-compliant code.<p>Also, if you do get some warnings when you switch to Clang, I would recommend fixing them rather than trying to squelch the warnings. Clang's warning set is pretty well-thought-out and things it flags as warnings are typically indicative of bad code (or coding practices).",1324435904

A person needs only a few common things to try programming: an off-the-shelf computer, maybe a book, and these days an Internet connection.  After that, they require only the traits common to any other hobby, such as <i>free time</i> and enough imagination to figure out what is going to be built.  (I'm glazing over a few details of course, such as the fact that knowing how to type would certainly speed things up.)<p>Programming is also an unusually marketable hobby skill.  With many hobbies you can invest a lot of time and effort and produce beautiful things, but that's liable to only gain you praise; in programming, it can gain you a really good job.  This is a pretty smart investment: for a modest expenditure yourself you might net a high income so it should not be surprising if people often teach themselves.<p>Besides, when I hire someone I <i>like</i> seeing evidence of side projects that reveal a certain passion for doing good software work.

The phrase is a little misleading.<p>The ""position"" of the inner electron orbitals is mostly determined by quantum rules (it is more complicated, but think that because of something like the Pauli Exclusion Principle the electrons cant be very close together).<p>The conductivity of the material depends on the farther electrons, but it is not possible to bring them closer to the core because that space is ""filled"" with the inner orbitals. The farther orbitals of the atoms get mixed and are transformed into bands, which are not localized in an atom, but span all the crystal.<p>With more pressure, the nuclear cores get closer, but not very much. The main change is how the farther electron orbitals interact. So at some distance it is possible that some orbital get mixed and at other distance another orbital get mixed. So at some distance the bands are empty or full, and at another distance the bands are partially filled. And that changes the conductivity of the material.<p>So probabbly the correct way to begin the article is: ""in Earth's deep interior squeeze atoms so closely together that their electrons (orbitals) interact very differently"".",1324435567

There are many recent advances that have helped improve drug development (human cells used in pre-clinical screening, more advanced clinical trial design, etc).<p>What I think has really changed is the cost of failure.  The best example I can think of is the discovery of benzodiazepines (the drug class that includes Valium).  The first benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide, Librium) was discovered in 1957 (we're talking, the FIRST set of pre-clinical tests) and it was on the market in 1960.  3 years from the first tests to market.<p>Nowadays, you'd be lucky to get to market in 15 years.  A great example is Qutenza.  The product is nothing more than a patch that contains a very high level of capsaicin (the stuff that makes peppers hot).  When you apply it to the skin, it can reduce the pain that sticks around after an attack of shingles.  I can't think of a product with fewer safety issues, yet it took 10 YEARS for the company to get FDA approval.<p>This is due to a combination of increased FDA scrutiny around safety along with a high standard for efficacy (i.e. we don't care if your drug reduces cholesterol, we want you to prove it reduces heart attacks).  So in the past, when a smaller, shorter trial was sufficient for FDA approval, you could take a promising drug all the way to the FDA without a lot of expense.  Not so anymore.",1324434710

I'm a student at the University of Waterloo, and in the courses in 1st and 2nd year a sizeable chunk of the marks depends on readability/documentation and such. We have coding guidelines and we lose marks for not following them. Needless to say, this doesn't mean most students at Waterloo write good, well-documented, readable code. Most of them are focused on getting the program to work, sprinkling in obvious comments (i.e. ""//setting width to 60"" ) and debugging when the tests fail. When they get marks off for poor documentation/readability they either complain or brush it off, claiming that since their program worked the rest isn't a big deal.<p>Bottom line: in my experience, the reason most programmers are self-taught with regard to writing good code is not that no one tries to teach them. It's that most of them don't think they NEED to know (i.e. don't place enough importance on it) and are willing to lose marks for it until they get to a job and they have no to choice but to, you guessed it, teach themselves. There are people who try to make the best out of their education, and these can be very good coders who learned by making the best of their education.<p>(Note: obviously this is a generalization - there are plenty of students who try to write good code.)",1324433976

It's like saying 'I want a safe car, and German tend to be safe, therefore I will buy a German' - it's valid in the absence of a real understanding of how to specify and select a safe car, but it's more vague than you'd be comfortable with. 
You expect an engineering company to be able to specify a safe car based on deep knowledge. But because our understanding of the disease, and of what different chemicals can do is incomplete, a drug company can't do that. 
Instead, they follow as many hints as they can to select a chemical that might work, and then advance it through a series of progressively more expensive trials until they are pretty sure it does more good than harm.<p>That's a valid way of doing things, and at the moment it's all we can do.

Being a generalist does not mean you have several discrete skills, and it does not mean you are a good a programmer as a ""programmer"" or as good a marketer as a ""marketer"", etc. I think this separation is a projection of a formal education. Instead I would describe generalism as about having one big formless ability accrued from every discipline you have studied. This is a potent skill as it gives you a broader understanding of how things work and sometimes the cross-pollination of ideas allows you to make much better decisions, and act in a way that others consider wildly creative.<p>Of course, that's not to say that being a generalist is somehow better than being a specialist. Unless you're a genius [1], specialists will often outperform you in their area of expertise. It can also be a little depressing. Sometimes it feels like you've taken 100 steps in a 100 directions and ended up very close to where you started. However, it definitely has its pros -- for me, it satisfies a thirst for all kinds of knowledge.<p>Ultimately the rigid distinction between specialist and generalist is artificial. Few are pure generalists and few are pure specialists. I don't worry that I will be held back by other's difficulty in fitting me into a role. I might have multiple abilities but like most of you I have some which I am slightly better at. I doubt that even the most fervent self-proclaimed generalists can avoid becoming a little specialist at something. ;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath</a>",1324433274

That class was brutal -- you had the match the style guide exactly, have good variable names, good comments, const-correctness, etc.<p>When I've taught programming to beginners, I try and demonstrate good code and when I see ugly code I point them in a better direction.  I have, however, had students be stubbornly focused on the output of their code and ignore all my advice.  No matter how ugly and hard to debug their code was, they refused to believe it mattered.",1324433270

Maybe see if you can partner up with groupon travel destinations as an adder and offer them a split of it. so if groupon sells a hotel package in Chicago you should be offering your Chicago package. I think living social offers vacation packages too.<p>You can offer a few different levels of service too: default is web/you print at home. You can offer a full color printed version with the order if you want as well. logistically this is harder but it seems like more of a deal.<p>There is also the fandango way of doing it too. offer the ability to prepay for the tickets and take a small commission off the top for that. that's tougher to sell to the consumer because you don't have the trust relationship and might leave them stranded at the venue with no valid tickets. It would be slick to have this so that they didn't have to wait in line at all. make it opt in though and let them select what they want to actually go to see/do.<p>An iPhone app that has everything integrated would be great but it could also be as easy as just an interface for the pdf. If you got it into the appstore you would increase your visibility a bit especially if you target the ""what should I do in x"" queries with adwords that linked to a specific version of your app. you could also have inapp purchases that would download a new guide. cross selling in your apps is a good thing in this case.<p>pretty interesting idea.

3376071,comment,3375806,3376003,5,0,spauka,,,"On the contrary, I don't really think that it is the University's job to teach ""programming"". University traditionally focuses around teaching the skills to do research. Higher level skills such as analysis and problem solving. Consider learning history. It is expected that you ""know"" how to write an essay. You may be critiqued on it, but it is not the primary motivation for your study of that subject.<p>My personal opinion is that university is not a place to learn tools (i.e. programming), but to learn to apply knowledge to form solutions to complex problems. We learn about algorithms, data structures and techniques because that is what we need to know to learn to solve hard problems. Programming, while not separate from this (i.e. you can hardly build anything without knowing how to use a screwdriver) is something that is assumed knowledge. Teaching it at university would waste valuable time in courses that are already too packed to give rigorous treatment of all topics covered.",1324433043

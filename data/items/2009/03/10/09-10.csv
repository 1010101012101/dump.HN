509760,comment,509571,509571,0,0,andrewf,,,"I'm skipping over the issue of your CEO's motives - he could  hate you and want you out, but assuming he doesn't..<p><i>despite the fact we've always done what we said we would when we said we would.</i><p>So you've got the commitment thing down: you make commitments and then stick to them. That's a reasonable baseline for reliability, but there is a whole world of value-add beyond it. The VPEng should be working to improve the company's ability to deliver product - even when the problems that need solving aren't with his direct reports.<p>In particular, you say the front office has problems communicating their vision. Do you work to improve their flawed and/or vague requirements, or do you let them hang themselves, and point to the requirements document when they're unhappy with the end result?<p>Longer term, have you tried to move towards more iterative processes (prototyping during requirements gathering, agile processes, etc) to reduce the damage done by poor requirements?<p>You sound like you are happier around, and have performed better in, the technical aspects of your job than the management aspects. Your CEO may (grain-of-salt) have noticed this. He could even be trying to give you what he thinks you want.<p>Consider that your CEO may have a management structure in mind where the process-and-timelines guy sits between him and the development team. Maybe you could have this job if you wanted it - but it would mean hiring a CTO to worry about the bigger picture, architecture, product etc. Your boss probably doesn't want to pervert the reporting structure he has in mind just so that roles in it matches what you want to do.",1236678680

The other programmers were pretty bad, probably the worst I've ever worked with. I also got the impression that programming was viewed as kind of a lower class job, something weirdos and foreigners did. Somehow I got lucky and was paid pretty well, but the local guys were making horrible salaries.",1236677335
509745,comment,509535,509535,0,0,drusenko,,,"I'd have to disagree a little here: I think the ""free"" aspect of the web is a tendency towards marginal cost. If the marginal cost of a user is a fraction of a cent, it does not make sense to charge every user -- they inherently know that the service should be free, and even if they don't, a competitor can gain an easy advantage by replicating what you do and offering it for free.<p>Amid all of this ""free"" bashing, it's also very important to note that not all ""free"" services are supported by ads. The ""freemium"" model (free services supported by paying users) works quite well for many services, including those that have a high enough marginal cost that making money off of advertising isn't enough -- these should be the same services people are willing to pay for, since they cost a lot more to support.<p>If they aren't (ie, the YouTube example), then you're probably just fucked. But it may very well still be early to call the game on YouTube, for example: the internet has a notoriously short time span, even though it might take a long time to ""mature"" a business. I'm not familiar with YouTube's specific financials, but given the size of the site and audience, I would be very careful to rush to conclusions on the current and future profitability of the site.",1236677189
509744,comment,509698,509698,0,0,thepanister,,,"Well, it depends on!\nI have already done such a thing before for my startup, and here is what I did:\n1- I created adwords campaign with $105 (I paid $10 only, and I had $100 adwords coupon), and I made the landing page is my startup's homepage.<p>2- I optimized the homepage to make it ready to use for the users without having to signup. So when the users visited the homepage, they knew what they should do - it was clear to them.<p>3- I added Google adwords' code for conversion on another page to measure if the users will reach to the point I want them to.\nGoogle Adwords will provide you with a code that you put on the target page that you want users to reach to, and if they do, then it means for you that they acheived your target.\nFor example, if you ask users at the home page to signup, then you add that code at the other page that will be for completed signup.<p>4- I found more than 90% of the people reached that target page, and I was so glad that I made something people want and would use.<p>It was a service that I provided online. I did not make signup because I just wanted to know if users would even be interested in using this service or not, and for how long.<p>I was so glad with the results.<p>If you want free $50 Google Adwords coupon code, I don't mind sharing it with you.",1236677140
509743,comment,509571,509592,0,0,swombat,,,"Spot on.<p>However... if the original poster feels up to it, he might decide for fight rather than flight.<p>I'm not a confrontational guy, but I like to get my point across when I think it matters.<p>Assuming the original poster has a significant share of the company, even if he retires it is very worthwhile (for the good of the company) to convince the CEO of a few points that are essential to the well-being of the company:<p>1) Recognising technical talent is very hard. This CEO is no doubt able to recognise management talent (or lack thereof) but that doesn't mean he will be able to pick a VP of Engineering who actually has technical ability.\nThe VPofE position needs strong technical ability to be able to interface effectively with the dev team (no developer will have any respect for a technically weak VPofE and they'll play him like a fiddle), and so he should be recruited by both the CEO and CTO together.<p>2) If the original poster doesn't enjoy the whole politics game, he should be happy to step aside out of the political line of fire. However, the VPofE (particularly as a new hire) still needs to be held accountable to someone technically qualified. The CEO ain't it. Management meetings involving the CEO and VPofE should involve both the CEO <i>and</i> the CTO, with the CTO there to ensure that the VPofE is not exploiting the technical inability of the CEO.<p>3) There's nothing especially wrong with the CTO stepping out of day to day development. However, that's a different job than being part of the dev team. So what should the CTO do? Well, there's plenty to do, I presume, in terms of driving the strategic direction of the company and ensuring the technology part of the company functions well with the non-technology part (which apparently is not the case at the moment). I think it would be a very effective shift for the poster to start focusing on ""the real problem"": ""the front office's lack of vision and an inability to communicate clearly whatever vision they might have"". That can largely be done by walking around and talking to people.<p>Freed from operational and dev duties, I think one of the CTO's primary respponsibility becomes to close that gap - and then any other ""high-level"" gaps that exist.<p>In short:<p>* Let the VPofE deal with development and managing the dev team.<p>* Hold him accountable in joint meetings with the CEO<p>* Focus on fixing the larger problems between the company's tech and non-tech silos<p>Of course, this requires building a stronger relationship with the CEO. However, this need not be such a tall task once the development responsibilities are delegated away, since those appear to be a big point of friction. Also, I imagine the CEO will respect this kind of reaction (much more than ""Really? Then I quit! <i>cries</i>"", anyway).",1236677066

You forget things constantly. Using before work is only interesting if your job is mind-numbingly dull.<p>Some more facts:<p>1. A single joint has about the effect of 4 glasses of alcohol, or 2-3 cups of coffee. But it's a downer instead of an upper, making you more relaxed.<p>2.

509739,comment,507185,509087,0,0,nicolas_t,,,"In japan, there is a strong pressure to not be the first one to leave the office (especially in small companies). Being a workaholic is considered good and being the one who works the longest carry a certain aura of prestige.... So the manager doesn't even really try to persuade you it's the environment around you, when it's officially  time to leave for the day and every one around you continues working, it's hard to go back home and you even end up using an excuse like if it was somehow wrong to respect you working hours.\nAnother thing, if you finish normally at 6pm, if the company organizes a dinner between coworker at an izakaya (a kind of pub), they usually plan to go around 8pm since everyone will still be working or busy at 6pm anyway...<p>On the flip side, a lot of smaller companies have rest areas  and it's not really looked down (at least for programmers) to go and read the newspaper or a manga during working hours to decompress from a problem.",1236676613

Its all about creating predicability out of uncertainty, and if the CEO doesn't feel predicability coming out of engineering, that puts his job on the line.<p>Some CEO's just get it, some need Gnatt charts and resource allocations on slides, some just need to to speak with confidence and act like an alpha male, etc.  In short, if you can figure out how he communicates, then you're likely to get along.  If not, it's unlikely you're going to make a great API/interface - and that's ok.  Better to let someone else take on the role than to be frustrated.<p>Although I hate to advocate this, having a CTO role is a nice way to vest for another 6-12months, relax a bit and start looking for new opportunities.<p>Help them find a good VP, if you like the person then maybe they can help run interference with the CEO and let you focus on the things you like.

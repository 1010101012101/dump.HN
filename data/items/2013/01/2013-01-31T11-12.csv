The cookies that are set when you go on the ICO websites do not include any third party advertising cookies.<p>For other sites, it is not guaranteed that an implied consent will be appropriate where for example third-party advertising cookies are set and very little information is provided generally (for example in a specific cookie policy).<p>As such, it is still for each website to consider whether in their own specific circumstances, it is appropriate to have an explicit consent or whether implied consent is ok. I appreciate that this creates ambiguity but as I understand it, it reflects the present position.<p>I still think the overall aim of the policy in terms of educating users as to  the nature of cookies is a good one.

It hit me so harsh that I felt like I lost the earth under my feet. Ive never felt anything similar and I can honestly say it was by far the worst period of my life. You wake up and you just dont have the courage to do anything. Every single insecurity I had surfaced during those two weeks multiplied by ten.<p>The odd thing is that those two weeks were the most socializing ones Ive ever spent. I felt like I wanted to be with other people 24/7 although it didnt make any difference to my condition. And this imho is the biggest problem with depression, there are no visible signs that someone suffers from it. So if you dont know if someone has it how can you help them.<p>Fortunately for me this hell lasted only a couple of weeks, until my body cope up with the lack of nicotine. I dont know how I would manage to live with something like that for years or even decades. I have the outmost respect and sympathy for the ones living with depression.<p>Without trying to be smart ass I have the feeling that depression is a fundamental problem of lifestyle standards. The majority of our insecurities are imposed on us by some wicked version of how life should be. So instead of enjoying the little moments of happiness we tend to believe that happiness is a constant situation which happens to be out of our grasp and thus we hammer ourselves with the inability to get there.

5144407,comment,5144325,5144386,7,0,cwzwarich,,,"Most CPUs have performance counters that let you determine when performance impacting events occur (e.g. pipeline flushes, reduced dispatch width, cache misses, etc.). In their simplest form they are a simple count, but there is usually some way to trigger an interrupt every N events rather than simply incrementing a counter, so that you can store the offending program counter somewhere for later aggregation. This functionality isn't always exposed very well by the OS, though. If you're using Linux then perf and oprofile are the standard ways to access performance counters.<p>Alternatively you can execute your code in a simulator with a cache model. Of course, this model won't actually match your hardware (unless you're using a serious cycle-accurate simulator), but it might be more insightful than performance counters alone. I don't know if any of the standard x86 emulators include a good cache model.",1359630052

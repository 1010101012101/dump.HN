Let&#x27;s think for a moment, would they indeed be acting the way you describe. To understand this, let&#x27;s find out who funds private prisons. In the current system, a government does. Private prisons indeed have an incentive to keep prisoners for as long as possible to extract the maximum amount of money from the government. Since government doesn&#x27;t spend its own money, it doesn&#x27;t care nearly as much as each one of us would for every cent we have.<p>In a system I advocate, private prisons are, just like police and firefighters, funded by private citizens. A private citizen doesn&#x27;t want to pay for the prisoner being held longer than it is truly required for him to become a decent member of the society again. If such a private prison decided to cheat its customers and extract more money by holding prisoners longer than needed, a customer may decide to stop paying it or switch to another prison (that is, switch to another protection agency). In many cases, people would not be send to prison at all, because it wouldn&#x27;t be economically feasible from the protection agency customers point of view.<p>Now tell me, what&#x27;s so extreme about my position?

Since the OpenGL fixed function pipeline could have been implemented to some degree above OpenGL ES (but never was), it forced developers to learn the entirety of rendering from modelview projection matrices, to setting up render buffers, to compiling shaders, and so on and so forth.  The small one-page examples that made OpenGL great are now project downloads and video tutorials and blog posts full of errata and workarounds.  To me, something of great value was lost in the transition, probably forever.<p>What I see now are the great failures of OpenGL ES.  Having to specify line widths in the shader.  Inconsistent support for points.  Not being able to predict if a shader will have one instruction too many and fall off the fast path.  I&#x27;ve learned it to great depths but the mental pollution I had to absorb in the process has caused lasting damage in the form of resentment and exhaustion.<p>If it was up to me, I would scrap the whole thing and just give developers full DSPs so they can write their own renderer in a language like a hybrid between Go and Matlab, but with exact specifications and basic hardware guarantees.",1374676438

People who sell digital content can&#x27;t use the same business model as people who sell non-trivially reproducible goods and expect to have the same success. In theory consumers could build their own copy of a good like a pair of jeans or a bicycle, but few have the skill or desire to create a high quality replica, and the parts and equipment are specialized and most likely need to be purchased.<p>Digital media is trivially reproducible by unskilled people with equipment they already have on hand. Instead of a high quality pair of jeans, their good is more like a burlap sack you tie around your waist with a bit of rope: anyone who&#x27;d be tempted to buy that product would probably just make their own at lower cost.<p>This if course does not address the skill and difficulty of creating music or film, but rather the difficulty of reproducing it, given a copy to work with. Thus, it&#x27;s reasonable to ask a large amount when crowd funding a film or album, because of course the artists should be well rewarded for their talent and effort and the many expenses in producing this good must be paid, but it&#x27;s a foolish business model to put the product out and then stomp your feet when people choose not to pay when they can trivially copy it.<p>It&#x27;s harder to copy a well-made T-shirt or hat and it&#x27;s impossible to copy the experience of a live performance, so selling those is a sensible venture as well.",1374675934

First, because there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it and it&#x27;s something a good many of ordinary people enjoy. Second, despite the previous, in many societies it&#x27;s still not considered a socially acceptable think to admit to liking even though almost everyone does, so people are far less likely to speak up in a manner that identifies them in order to protest it. Third, some of the actually banned (and not just filtered) content is rape fantasy, which is a hugely popular fantasy among <i>women</i>, and many object to its being banned. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, making it opt-in is a big deal because it takes a freedom and weakens it. If we have to ask the government for permission to do something, it&#x27;s not a freedom, it&#x27;s something being allowed by government for now, and they can change it whenever they want. This is the same reason people advocate open source tools and non-proprietary protocolsso we have our own freedom of choice and can avoid being locked into the whims of whoever holds the power. Porn is an easy place for them to start, because large subsets of society won&#x27;t speak out in defense of porn, but I guarantee if this sort of filter remains in place long-term, it will be used to block more than porn. That may not even be their intent right now, but when you have a massive internet filtration system in place, it makes it extremely easy to justify adding in a few more filters blocking sites troublesome to the government in a few years.",1374675931

Solving your own problems has merit if your problems aren&#x27;t rare, or can be a financial engine.<p>It&#x27;s an opportunity to grow beyond where too many techs are today... they simply don&#x27;t see how many people are so passionate about what they do that they are willing to do the most unreasonable thing: calculate, track, and manage things by pen and paper, or whatever they can get in a spreadsheet.<p>To me, when I see someone do something by hand, manually, because they&#x27;re so passionate to get it done, or have no choice, it&#x27;s a mirror to me.  How the hell do my talents add value if others are stuck with what they&#x27;re doing because no one is giving them any attention?<p>Instead, we have techs justify what they&#x27;re doing to be something grand and great to &quot;make it up&quot;, or some how make life more worthwhile?<p>Maybe, part of this is from an preference to relate to a keyboard instead of relating to others.  Maybe its a part of maturity and starting to see one&#x27;s self as part of a bigger whole.  The need for an ability to shift lenses is critical, because hiding behind a keyboard is not ok anymore, the world has arrived on our doorsteps asking to solve problems with tech.<p>Software can either make people&#x27;s lives much harder or easier. Being on the right side of the equation, even if it&#x27;s giving up a few hours a week just to solve anyone&#x27;s problems with a script will uncover more opportunities for creating value (read: the right ones will be dying to pay you something to keep your attention).<p>Ironically perhaps, most of all, is the fact that having a financial engine lets you drive and pursue more of the things you want with your time and by being able to pay for the time of others.",1374675602

What type of entity is raising the funds (startup, limited company, etc.) is irrelevant. The point is that they are asking for an <i>investment</i>, and yes, as you point out, there are no refunds if an investment doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>This is very different from the mindset of a consumer, who is purchasing the product that was created with the investors money. If the investment doesn&#x27;t pan out, the consumer has nothing to buy. The investor looses their investment.<p>My concern is that by offering product in exchange for investment (essentially a forward contract[1]), consumers are lured into taking on the risks of investors. The language on the fundraising page is, unfortunately, quite vague about this.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying that Canonical can&#x27;t deliver, and I&#x27;m certain that they&#x27;ll do their best to make this work out. I do wish that they&#x27;d make a better effort of warning off people who think they&#x27;re simply buying a phone that won&#x27;t be delivered for many months.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_contract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_contract</a>",1374674731

You can apply these rules in just about any modern page-layout program or word processor.</i><p>To emphasise what I said above: the book is passing off a didactic point about authoring (yes, many newspapers and publishers want their journalists and authors to follow the one-space rule in their copy) into a simplistic rule of typography, one which happens to be meaningless in many contexts and is based on fallacious reasoning.",1374674499

It&#x27;s like: we don&#x27;t give a fuck and we critique everything is stupid, except they have an impressive lack of arguments and a very big focus on things they dislike. I can ensure you that unfollowing is not enough of an option... both at-messages and the search timelines are full of their tweets.<p>IMHO to deal with these guys the good recipe is:<p>1) If they have some remotely valid point, reply with arguments, try to move them into the &quot;arguments land&quot;, and maybe they&#x27;ll say something useful for a give project / community after all.<p>2) If they are trolling, you have two options, the wise one is ignoring them and just provide facts if it is a group-conversation on Twitter. Otherwise if you feel like that (I do), troll back. Usually this kind of personality is found in insecure people, it is not hard to find their weakness and troll back, can be quite funny actually.",1374674415

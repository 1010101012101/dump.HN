Theft to catch up, and education to secure a future.<p>It&#x27;s unwise to treat so large a country as only capable of doing one thing at a time.

9572715,comment,9568778,9572626,0,0,Nadya,,,"If I may go into a slightly related tangent for game devs.<p>Some game devs spend a lot of time and money trying to prevent people from modding their games. Some game devs make it easier to mod their games or even encourage it.<p>If a mod gets popular and gets a community growing around the game - is it doing good or is it doing harm? Assuming that a large amount of the community growth is from people <i>pirating the game</i> to play the modded version (and assuming none of the above server issues)<p>There are 2 sides with difficult-to-measure metrics.<p>1) Is the mod and the pirates playing it bringing enough attention to the game and free publicity/advertisement as to onboard new paying customers?<p>2) Is the time and money spent on preventing such a mod community from growing going to cost more than potential &quot;lost sales&quot; of pirated copies of the game? In addition, what is a &quot;lost sale&quot; and how are they measured?<p>To expand upon the issue of &quot;lost sales&quot; a bit:<p>Plenty of pirates argue that if they could not pirate a game - they would not purchase it either. I fall into this crowd. Outside of the stupid amount of money I&#x27;ve spent on League of Legends, I&#x27;ve only spent money on games I originally pirated. I purchased the game, purchased DLC, or purchased merchandise related to the game. If I could not pirate the game - I would not bother playing it, telling my friends to buy it, or buying merchandise from it (since I wouldn&#x27;t know I liked it!)<p>By allowing people <i>like me</i> to pirate you actually <i>win an otherwise lost sale</i>. This is what makes these metrics so hard to quantify. Too many game studios consider <i>all piracy to be a lost sale</i> when people like me are the exact opposite. <i>Without piracy we would have been a lost sale.</i><p>So it comes down to &quot;which game studio/game dev do you want to take their word for?&quot; Many of them <i>attribute their success to piracy of their games</i>. Some of them say <i>piracy killed their game</i>.<p>Without quantifiable metrics... how do we know the &quot;killed games&quot; didn&#x27;t die simply because they were <i>bad games</i> that, piracy aside, nobody wanted to purchase?<p>From a business perspective, that&#x27;s the far more likely scenario than the <i>good games</i> that the game devs claimed <i>piracy helped</i> selling well regardless of piracy because ???<p>TL;DR<p>My argument is that piracy doesn&#x27;t kill bad games due to lost sales. They don&#x27;t get any sales because <i>their game is bad</i> and few people are willing to pay for it. On the contrary, popular <i>pirated games</i> still do amazingly well because they are <i>good games</i> that people are <i>willing to pay for</i> even with the availability of pirating. To myself, makes more sense from an economic perspective for gaming media.",1432065593

If you were to build a gas powered multirotor, you&#x27;d have to have a central engine connected to each motor by means of some complicated mechanical linkage. This would also mean you could no longer control the speeds of the motors individually, so you&#x27;d have to achieve lateral movement by pitching the propellers, like on a helicopter. All these things mean that it simply doesn&#x27;t make sense to build a non-electric multirotor, it&#x27;d be massively expensive and inefficient you&#x27;d be better off going back to a helicopter.<p>In terms of fixed wing drones, the benefit of electric over gas is mainly ease of use I believe. It&#x27;s a lot simpler for someone to charge a battery and just plug it in than it is for them to fill up canisters, refuel the engine and cope with the complexities of tweaking and starting an engine. That extra effort and learning curve isn&#x27;t worth it for the slightly longer slight time.<p>For aerial mapping the go-to option is normally fixed wing drones, they can easily achieve 30-40 minutes of flight time and this is normally enough for those kind of applications.",1432064667

The point of these tests is to have an opportunity to see how candidates go through the process of solving problems by approaching a problem that is well-understood by the interviewer.  Good interviewers pair with the candidate and help to coach him/her towards a solution.  This is a carefully crafted simulation of two people working together in which certain variables can be controlled.  It&#x27;s also time-limited because most interviewers have to go through dozens of candidates to find someone who is a good fit for a particular team and culture.  It&#x27;s economically infeasible to hire a bunch of people on a per-trial basis.  It&#x27;s also hurtful to bring someone in for a few days, and then tell them that they aren&#x27;t working out.<p>Normally, when I heard this whole &quot;I don&#x27;t do coding tests&quot; attitude, it comes from a candidate who thinks that he/she is so amazing that the rules don&#x27;t apply.  If such candidates flounce out of my tech screening because I dared to give them a problem, then my tech screening has worked.  In my experience, most good engineers have tempered their egos with a dose of humility.  They have hit the wall of their abilities, and they understand that they aren&#x27;t nearly as amazing as they thought they were when they were younger.  They are more careful, and they are open minded.  I won&#x27;t dismiss a candidate for lacking humility if I believe that he or she can grow, but if given the choice between a good candidate with humility and a stellar candidate who is too good for a test, I&#x27;ll pick the good candidate every day.

Everything else on your drone is weightless, and your motors have perfect efficiency. To keep this aloft, you need to overcome 9.8 m/s^2 that is applied by Earth&#x27;s gravity; but since we&#x27;re simplifying things, let&#x27;s just round that to 10 m/s^2. 10 m/s^2 * 100g is 1 N, which means it requires 1 W of power to keep that battery aloft (resist the force of gravity). 1Ah * 10 V = 10 Wh, so that means you could stay aloft for 10 h (remember, these numbers are unrealistic, we have ignored any kind of efficiency, or the weight of the rest of the drone, etc).<p>So, lets use two batteries. Now we have 20 Wh of energy available, but we&#x27;re holding up 200g of battery, which requires 2 W of power to stay aloft, so again, we can stay aloft for just 10 h.<p>And remember, all of this was ignoring any notion of efficiency or the weight of any other part of the craft to support this. As you increase the weight, motors will need to get more powerful to be able to actually keep it aloft, which means they need to get bigger, which is extra weight that you need to support that isn&#x27;t giving you any extra energy. So the real world is actually even worse than our idealized model; as you add on more battery, only a fraction of the increase in weight adds more energy, so you will actually see shorter flight times.<p>Now, of course, there are designs for which increasing the amount of battery can lead to increased flight times. If the power supplied by the motors is sufficient to sustain the extra weight, so they don&#x27;t need to be scaled up, then increasing the amount of battery relative to the rest of the weight of the craft can lead to higher efficiency as there is less relative &quot;dead weight&quot; (weight besides the batteries, that is not carrying energy). But that can only take you so far, which is why the flight times of drones plateau at a certain point and you can&#x27;t fix it by just adding more battery.<p>This is why you don&#x27;t see electric helicopters carrying people. The energy to weight ratio for batteries is too low; only fossil fuels have a sufficient energy density.",1432064029

In the coming decades, governments around the globe will face unprecedented national security threats mounted by flooding, extreme weather storms, scarcity of fresh drinking water, and shrinking food supplies. Countries that lack the resources or political will to act now may be visited by great tragedies. Natural catastrophes and famines driven by climate change may cause future wars and revolutions.<p>With respect to Fascism, the countries we used to refer to as &quot;The Free World&quot; have become Orwellian police states. This is much more than a privacy issue or a national security issue. We are headed towards a world where dissent is no longer possible. As governments continue to spy on literally all of their citizens, the types of non-violent protests and civil disobedience which helped bring about the end of the Vietnam war and racial segregation in the US will be proactively contained. Potential protesters will be identified, harassed, and intimidated long before the target dates of their planned protests. Heavily armed and violent paramilitary groups will occupy potential arenas of demonstration in the run up to events such as political and economic conventions. Meanwhile,   the media will whip the public into a paranoid frenzy over &quot;terrorists planning to attack&quot; these events.<p>With respect to religion, the Middle East will continue to fight wars driven by religious fanaticism. I refer not just to radical Islamists, but to Christian fundamentalists and Zionists (both Christian and Jewish). In the Catholic spheres of influence, overpopulation and AIDS will continue to be a problem because use of condoms is discouraged.

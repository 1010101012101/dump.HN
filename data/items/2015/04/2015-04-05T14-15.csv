I guess this could come down to automate or adoption of cloud services. I still see lots of dev roles around, so is it worth considering a switch to venture down a career path that has lots of jobs available in the long-term?",1428245972

(My understanding is that the term of service is standard across the state but the number of days a week is a function of the typical case load in the specific county so the more urban counties require more days than the more rural ones.) I know someone who was on a grand jury in a New Hampshire county and it was (I believe) for a shorter period and only one day per week. The degree of inconvenience obviously also depends on your job.

Fish, egg and even the rice is relatively labour intensive. Remember, it&#x27;s not just plain rice, it&#x27;s rice cooked with traditional methods to exactly the right point, mixed with vinaigre with an assistant venting by hand to give it a drier surface.<p>* Good Sushi needs to be prepared right before consumption, so the Sushi chef will spend at least a few minutes for each portion.<p>Adding all this up propably comes out at around 5-10 bucks labour cost for a decent portion of Sushi. Add to this the fish, the rent and some markup and you&#x27;re at your $25. Nothing remarkable really, it&#x27;s the same for most other high quality foods in large cities.",1428245736

Now, as a &quot;born&quot; software engineer with a decent portfolio (now age 21) recently frustratated by a fruitless job search, turned down again and again (I believe rightfully so) because the competition all had college degrees, I beg to differ.<p>A good college degree (especially in STEM fields) provide the basic foundation upon which to innovate. Our industries have gone so deep, and we are standing on such giant shoulders, that anyone who is going to take it further must first absorb the century or so of knowledge created so far on the subject. Even in Computer Science, the next innovation is not yet another WhatsApp, it&#x27;s more along the lines of Counsyl (a dna-sequencing app), where a person without the knowledge-foundation equivalent of a degree simply would never get started with <i>the idea</i> of making such software, leave alone actually building it.<p>And I say that as a self-taught software engineer. Yes I can probably build the next Snapchat on my own. But even then I recognize the huge gaps in my knowledge due to being self taught, especially low-level stuff like kernels, bits and bytes, and fundemental details of cryptography and security.

The mitigating circumstances would be considered and the cop might get off with less, but they should be under the same law as everybody else!

A non-counterexample to a universal claim is not evidence that it is true; evidence is simply not an applicable concept and misleading. If you accept a logical statement on evidence, you&#x27;re committing a logical fallacy.<p>Now if we want to study the color of ravens <i>empirically</i>, then we must throw away the logical proposition.

I hoped one day that it would be able to reverse engineer what other market-moving bots were set to do, and adjust accordingly to profit from their moves.<p>I imagine if such a thing were made available for public consumption, that they&#x27;d wind up working against each other, & it might defeat its purpose.<p>But I liked to think about it for awhile, until I looked into it & was crushed by the complexity of it.",1428242925

From speaking with my coworkers who were alumni of the university I was attending and were of the same major, it really seemed like the rigor disappeared. The amount of times a professor would extend deadlines, cull portions of an assignment, or just flat out cancel it because of students complaining became enough to drive me away from classes. In several other courses, we had adjuncts that were former K-12 educators and they frequently treated us as their former students. In fact, the final straw that lead to me leaving the university entirely was an incident where I was castigated by an adjunct German professor for the atrocity of discretely pulling out my phone in order to translate a word so I could properly ask a question of the professor. This was only a few years ago, and having tutored a few friends through the years, I have a good idea of the state of things. They haven&#x27;t changed.",1428242856

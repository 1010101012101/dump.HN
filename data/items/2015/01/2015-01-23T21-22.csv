How can libre software have evil intentions?<p>It is not evil, it just stupid. Lots of effort now is wasted because they made the stupid mistake to use illegitimate assets. And of course stupidity does not absolve responsibility.<p>> And, in the end, isn&#x27;t that why we have libre software at all? We want to have control over the software, instead of the software having control over us, right?<p>That is exactly why it is so important to do these sorts of things by the book. By crossing the line authors of this project gave away large chunk of the control they (and us by extension) had.",1422050342

Since average telomere length is often measured in white blood cells it goes up and down with health and generally downward with age. Stem cell activity declines with age, so this shouldn&#x27;t be surprising.<p>Lengthening telomeres via telomerase may extend life in mice for any number of reasons, some of which actually have nothing to do with telomeres. Telomerase, like all biomolecules, has a lot of roles, not all of which are fully understood. Alternative and more controllable methods of lengthening telomeres should help narrow down what is going on in those studies. Is it greater stem cell activity, something to do with telomerase influencing mitochondrial function, something completely different?<p>In general if you&#x27;re thinking of aging as accumulated molecular damage, telomere shortening looks like a consequence not a root cause. It may cause further issues itself, but targeting it is probably not as effective as going for the actual root causes that lead to it. The interesting question is why telomerase therapy does do comparatively well in extending life in mice.",1422050097

I had a lot of fun making it, and I hope you enjoy it.<p>One of my favorite parts of Swift is the optional concept, which separates variables which are never null from variables that can sometimes be null. This helps prevent errors from trying to use objects that don&#x27;t exist. The syntax involves `!` and `?` which can make your code seem excited and confused, but it&#x27;s definitely a step toward making your code safer!<p>For example, say you have a UI element that <i>might</i> have a label. If indeed it has a label, and you wanted to set the color of it to red, you can store your label like this:<p>`var label: UILabel?`<p>which signals that it may not exist. Then to set the color, you would do this:<p>`label?.textColor = UIColor.redColor()`<p>The question mark says if it isn&#x27;t there, then don&#x27;t assign the new color. We don&#x27;t need to check the case where the label does not exist because Swift automatically does it for us!",1422050017

8937513,comment,8936257,8937239,0,0,mdasen,,,"Content ID brings up an interesting twist on the DMCA.  If a provider has &quot;actual knowledge&quot; of infringement, safe harbor doesn&#x27;t apply.  When Viacom sued Google/YouTube, they claimed that Google/YouTube had &quot;general knowledge&quot; of infringement.  That isn&#x27;t enough.<p>Google is paying this person for use of their work.  They have knowledge and it could be argued that they obtained a license.  They want to renegotiate the terms of that license.  The DMCA isn&#x27;t a tool to be used to force artists to license their content on terms that favor YouTube.<p>The actual safe harbor text (17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(1)(A)):<p>i. does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing;<p>ii. in the absence of such actual knowledge, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or<p>iii. upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material.<p>It&#x27;s certainly questionable whether Content ID gives Google &quot;actual knowledge&quot; of infringement happening.  But the rule isn&#x27;t that content only has to be taken down when given a DMCA notice.  Once Google has &quot;actual knowledge&quot;, they need to take action.<p>And I think that&#x27;s the alternative that Google would do.  Videos that match the Content ID would be removed.  I think the issue is that the artist doesn&#x27;t want to be so punitive to fans who are caught in the middle.  Google knows that artists don&#x27;t want to hurt their fans and is leveraging that against them.  I don&#x27;t think this would become a DMCA issue at all.  It&#x27;s more an issue of Google having the market power to be a price/terms setter.  Google seems more than willing to use Content ID to block infringement, but also has the positioning to reply to the user, &quot;this artist has decided you, the uploader who worked hard on that video, that you&#x27;re not allowed to use their music.  Maybe you should hate that artist and like one of these other artists. . .&quot;  A bit of hyperbole, but you can see how an artist wouldn&#x27;t want to position themselves that way.",1422049804

If this were I6, I&#x27;d have to write giant functions and collect these snippets together -- in the right order, etc. If this were an OO language, I&#x27;d go crazy deciding what object each snippet is a method of. I7 just takes the above and runs.

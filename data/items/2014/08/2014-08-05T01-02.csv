8135168,comment,8120053,8135006,8,0,srean,,,"> All ML is density estimation using a parametric probability distribution.<p>Umm is there a typo there ? Otherwise it is so wrong that I cannot even begin to pick the flaws.<p>In fact the key revolutionary idea in classification theory, courtesy Vapnik, was that one needn&#x27;t estimate the density at all.<p>I cannot over-emphasize the revolutionary part, prior to Vapnik, that over-arching consensus was that one should try to learn the the density and then threshold it to obtain the classifier. The motivation for this is the result that the thresholded conditional probability is the optimal classifier for a {0,1} loss.<p>What Vapnik showed was that it is better to learn the classifier directly (he called it structural risk  minimization, SRM, for short), without any parametric assumptions whatsoever. The main reasoning is that density estimation is freaking hard, and depending on a freaking hard task as a pre-requisite is backwards. Learning to classify is actually easier than learning densities. It was one of those paradigm shifts that come to a field only once in a while.<p>Even if we let SRM be, even in traditional statistics there have been methods as old as time that do not assume any parametric model. Those into non-parametric statistics (I am not one) would be very upset with your claim :) The problem with parametric models is that <i>you almost never know</i> the parametric family. You can of course test, but how many would you test, there are infinite number of such families. Non-parametric methods dont make parametric assumptions, (they do make some and considerably weaker assumptions. Assumptions are necessary for learning). The drawback is that they are more expensive, similarly if you happen to know the correct form of the family parametric model would be hard to beat.",1407203996

8135156,comment,8135123,8135123,1,0,nostrademons,,,"I wonder how the economics of the cloud industry will eventually play out.  Right now, it&#x27;s enormously profitable, because Amazon is the clear market leader and there&#x27;re some fairly significant switching costs.<p>However, building out the cloud infrastructure is a side-effect of being any Internet business that achieves reasonable scale.  And once you do that, it&#x27;s both relatively inexpensive and quite profitable to enter the IaaS market and resell some of that additional computing capacity to other smaller firms.  Cloud computing is almost totally undifferentiated; you&#x27;re selling basic computing resources (CPU, RAM, disk) for money.<p>My hunch is that cloud is going to become like the airline industry.  An oligopoly with periodic price wars.  It has the same &quot;high fixed cost, low marginal cost&quot; economics as airlines, the same need for <i>some</i> baseline technical knowledge but not enough that you can differentiate on product quality, and the same price-sensitivity.  It&#x27;s possible that the switching costs of migrating your data between cloud providers might put a barrier on competition and preserve some profit margins, but I suspect that any well-used service will be able to migrate their data out for a small fraction of their monthly bandwidth costs.<p>The airline industry is wonderfully beneficial to consumers, but it&#x27;s been a dud for investors and operators over its 100-year history.",1407203839

8135148,comment,8133103,8134092,3,0,australis,,,"A similar effect can be noticed on sections of roads with dedicated overtaking lanes. Cars that are travelling below the speed limit for long stretches of road (and can&#x27;t be overtaken due to the road), tend to speed up to the actual speed limit when an overtaking lane comes along - likely due to the more open road, they feel safer driving faster, etc.<p>This makes it more difficult for all the (often frustrated) drivers behind to pass the slow car when the time comes, often meaning they put on the afterburners and exceed the speed limit to overtake - which could lead to more accidents, especially if they are trying to squeeze past at the end of the overtaking section, if it is quite short, or there are many cars stuck behind as &#x27;prisoners&#x27;.",1407203692

The hardware looks and feels more like some of the midrange LG phones I’ve used in the past, and compares poorly not only to the iPhone but also recent Samsung and HTC phones.

8135128,comment,8134079,8135031,4,0,mpdehaan2,,,"We&#x27;ve never held back anything from Ansible, really.  Rather, Tower is more of a product on top that provides some extra enterprise features that most of our user bases don&#x27;t need (but they should try it, because they might!).<p>I think if you see things like Windows being part of Ansible proper, it&#x27;s clear we&#x27;re not holding that back.  But there are also tools the OSS community can&#x27;t build easily, things that involve coordination around database schemas and (ick!) status meetings and UX mockups.<p>Yes, communities can build them, but occasionally, just occasionally, companies can build them better.  And this is one of those cases.  Our business model basically funds Ansible and also makes Tower significantly more capable that way, and it only becomes something you need when you can afford it.  And it&#x27;s not so much because we&#x27;re a company, because I&#x27;ve got tons of awesome folks working in 100% full time, and that&#x27;s a lot of power to build good stuff.  Most likely your company employs a few folks as well :)<p>So on the &quot;open core&quot; comment, Ansible won&#x27;t, for instance, ever have proprietary modules.  That&#x27;s something we said we don&#x27;t do.  Ever.<p>As for Tower, the small guy isn&#x27;t going to need it yet.  He&#x27;s probably ok with pure Jenkins fronting the show.  The big guy probably needs it and a super-well-tested environment and a guy to call when it has issues.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about other communities you&#x27;ve been a part of, but I think our track record shows what goes where\nand people are comfortable with it.  Ansible isn&#x27;t open core.  It&#x27;s the real deal.  We take that seriously.<p>Yet, I think the general assumption that all software has to be purely 100% open is flawed, but that in general, open source communities can build some things in GREAT fantastic ways, and certain layers do benefit from being free software.  But companies need to exist.  Including yours!  (Though I do love me some Uber).<p>Anyway, ansible-pull is indeed an option if you wanted to go that wrote, or even doing image builds with Packer.  Both popular options for immutable systems and/or autoscaling, sans commercial bits.<p>But is commercial software dirty?  Heck no.  Ask any SaaS company :)",1407203108

8135093,comment,8134182,8134182,2,0,titanomachy,,,"Proof of Stake seems like an interesting idea. I&#x27;ve often wondered if bitcoin&#x27;s proof-of-work verification model would remain viable as the currency reaches the end of its generation phase and the incentives for hashing become negligible. Off-chain transactions will become more and more popular, which not only draws revenue away from the hashers but also undermines the consistency of the system.<p>Tezos&#x27; second innovation, its ability to incorporate changes to the protocol without forking, is also interesting but raises some questions. If I understand correctly, stakeholder consensus is required to integrate a change to the protocol. The author gives an example where a developer attempting to remove this safety mechanism would fail because the stakeholders, recognizing that the change is not in their interest, would reject it -- analogous to voters rejecting a proposal to eliminate democracy, I suppose.<p>However, this seems to rest on the assumption that a majority of stakeholders are familiar enough with the protocol to recognize which changes are beneficial to them and which aren&#x27;t, in situations less obvious than the above example. Further, they must be willing to put in some time and effort to understand the amendment and cast their vote. My hypothesis is that this would lead to a disproportionate concentration of power in the hands of those who control large amounts of currency, precisely the problem that PoS purports to avoid.<p>The entities controlling large amounts of currency have plenty of incentive to understand the protocol well and vote on every proposed amendment. The average user, who controls a small wallet and uses the currency for day-to-day transactions, has much less incentive: the average user of HTTPS does not feel the need to educate themselves on the underlying technology, nor is the average user of dollars familiar with macroeconomic policy. So the amendments which pass &quot;review&quot; will be the ones most favourable to larger entities, even if these entities control less than half the actual currency. I don&#x27;t buy into the idea that those with monopolies have little incentive to abuse them: even if a protocol change will eventually alienate users and devalue the currency, the controlling entities may still choose to implement it for short-term profit, undermining the currency in the process.",1407202400

Bad roads and unsafe vehicles explain part of the problem; but what I think accounts for the gist of it is something I haven&#x27;t seen commented here: people speed because they want to be faster than other people. The speed limit merely makes this easier by limiting risk averse or society minded people.<p>I stoped driving long distances a year ago because it was stressing me out and because a car here is too expensive (compared to bus for long distances and taxi for short ones).<p>What I noticed in myself and in drivers around me was that traffic was regarded as a competition. Being faster was better. If someone was faster than you you&#x27;d be passive-aggressive towards him/her (mostly him). Brasil ranks 2nd (to last) on this list because of the way we view cars: they are really expensive, even in an expensive country such as ours. They are regarded as a life milestone, one of the main goal in our lives. They become a way of posing yourself as superior to the masses. This results in a more competitive traffic. Closing people off, tailgating and speeding (50% more than the limit - above this you risk losing your license and get fined for about $500) are the bread and butter of a good sum of our drivers. Our national speed limit is 120kmph (75mph).<p>Why do most people speed slightly? Is it because of the time they will save? I bet most don&#x27;t even look at their watches while doing so. For a fixed distance, the speed x time is a hyperbole, which means diminishing returns for greater speeds for distances greater than the value of your speed. I posit that the gain is not time, but a better position at an acceptable risk in a competitive game we call transit.",1407200539

I've just been taking video of the iPhone simulator, but it doesn't shows a mouse instead of a user's finger.<p>Anyone know if there is a good way to make that sort of demo video?",1254552737

858578,comment,858548,858548,0,0,yannis,,,"Engineers were building steam engines before there was any thermodynamics. Engineers were playing with batteries before anyone could understand why they were producing an electrical current. The theories followed and they were based on Maths. Maths is the underlying 
analytical tool.<p>There was never a 'Theory for Mechanical Engineering' or 'Electrical Engineering', why the need for a 'Theory for Software Engineering'?<p>Best practices develop over decades (for example in Fire Protection Engineering), as well as Management techniques to manage time and complexity.<p>Is the Model View Controller technique a theory? No, it is just a management technique. (It will work just fine in one long program as well).<p>Just hack and let the theories follow :)",1254551860

858576,comment,857130,857683,0,0,dejb,,,"> Guilt by association is well established as a logical fallacy.<p>Yes but there is a significant portion of the population that doesn't understand this. They are indeed likely to give the both the article and the underlying research much less credit.<p>> Guilt by association is well established as a logical fallacy.<p>It depends on your context. The underlying proposition is unaffected by its supporters but your 'best guess' view of it based on limited information needs to take this into consideration. Apart from unreliable sources I'm sure there are some people who pass on information which is anti-correlated with the truth. A biblical creationist is likely to be strongly attracted to exactly research that an evolutionist would dismiss. Both of these two would be right in pre-judging any research put forward by the other as have a reduced probability of being valid according to their views of reality.",1254551187

Still, seniority counts for A LOT on SO, and of course I'll never catch up to Jon -- if I keep gaining 15.4 points/day on him, bridging the 64337-points gap would take me almost 12 <i>years</i> from now... I kind of doubt it will happen!-)<p>BTW, I made a ""lateral career shift"" within Google -- since about a year ago -- I'm not ""uber tech lead"" now, I'm ""senior staff engineer"" (no people-management chores -- I get to hack on code/design/debugging/architecture, nag^H^H^H evangelize on proper development methods, &c, in >80% of my time, vs ~40/50% of my time -- and that, with an effort!-) -- averaged over the many years in which I was uber tech lead, saddled with people management, budgets, strategy staff meetings, and the like... management at google is cooler than anywhere else I had ever managed, but, it IS still management in the end;-).",1254550866

SQL offers the ability to define an alias name.<p>Unfortunately that would be a kind of kitchen sink feature that no standards committee is likely to accept. As a substitute, one could create a variable with a long name, then put the value into another variable with a short name, but that could be confusing unless very clearly noted in a comment.",1254550065

Right now, the nicest thing that can be said for the various things we espouse is that they are ""laws"" based on empirical observation.<p>But we don't have an underlying theory explaining which programming languages are more productive than others, or which processes will work and which will fail. It's a lot like chemistry before the periodical table and especially before quantum mechanics. In orther words, it's alchemy.",1254549962

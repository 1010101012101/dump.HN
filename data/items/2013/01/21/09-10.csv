5090744,comment,5090007,5090007,4,0,d0m,,,"So.. here's something that happened to me in my engineering software university.<p>A friend of me just had a summer internship in a security firm and learned a trick or two. And, looking at the html/javascript code of a page, there was an obvious entry point that gave access to anyonela else account provided you had their student number (i.e. skip the password step).<p>So my friend showed it to me and I suggested he tell the IT department. Obviously, the next thing we know, he's accused of ""Hacking"" and get menaced by the IT department.<p>A couple days later, we check back the website and realize that a trivial <i>encryption</i> is added.. I.e. you have to reverse the student number or something like that. And, obviously, just on the client-side.<p>A little bit pissed, we decided to take our revenge of being menaced for just being nice. So we create a web page where it explains the story (That we found an entry point, that we told the IT, etc.) and then, we say ""Try it!"" [<enter student number>] which directly logs you in into their account.<p>We e-mail that page to the main directors of the school by suggesting a quick fix. And, we make sure to CC the IT departments.<p>The day after it was fixed and we received a real ""thanks"" from the authority. I guess the trick is to contact a higher authority rather than directly contacting the IT department.",1358762176

If he only accidentally found the flaw and reported it to the responsible person, things would be fine. But security testing without the permission of the system owner is the same as unauthorized access attempt!<p>I work as a security professional for 7 years, and I recently did a guest lecture on the college discussing the example like this. Most students were not aware where the problem is. Maybe it would help imagining how would story like this look in the physical world: \nLet's suppose you come back home and find someone picking on your door lock with a lock picking tool. You ask him ""what are you doing?"" and he says ""I'm just checking is your lock safe. I do it for your security."" Would you believe him? Or would you call the police immediately, without asking him anything? \nLet's add to this that security testing tools can sometimes degrade the tested system's performance or sometimes even crash it. In this case, it's not just unauthorized access attempt, but successful denial-of-service attack!<p>Never, ever, do a security testing of the system without the written permission of the system owner. If you get the permission, you will probably be asked to sign an NDA in return. You will also need to provide some information, like source IP address you're using and emergency contacts that can be used to stop the testing in case of problems (like crashes, etc.). This is the only lawful and ethical way to do these kind of procedures on someone else's system.<p>I'm not discussing if the penalty is OK in this case. It really doesn't matter if most people here cannot tell what he did wrong in the first place.",1358761732

I direct you to Banting and Best (which I also linked below):<p><a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/discovery-insulin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/disco...</a><p><pre><code>  Early in 1921, Banting took his idea to Professor John    \n  Macleod at the University of Toronto, who was a leading \n  figure in the study of diabetes in Canada. \n\n  Banting and Best began their experiments by removing the \n  pancreas from a dog. ... By giving the diabetic dog a few \n  injections a day, Banting and Best could keep it healthy \n  and free of symptoms.\n\n  The team was eager to start testing on humans. But on whom \n  should they test? Banting and Best began by injecting \n  themselves with the extract. They felt weak and dizzy, but \n  they were not harmed.\n\n  In January 1922 in Toronto, Canada, a 14-year-old boy, \n  Leonard Thompson, was chosen as the first person with \n  diabetes to receive insulin. The test was a success. \n  Leonard, who before the insulin shots was near death, \n  rapidly regained his strength and appetite. The team now \n  expanded their testing to other volunteer diabetics, who \n  reacted just as positively as Leonard to the insulin \n  extract.\n\n  The news of the successful treatment of diabetes with \n  insulin rapidly spread outside of Toronto, and in 1923 the \n  Nobel Committee decided to award Banting and Macleod the \n  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n</code></pre>\nTwo years from idea to animal trials to safety trials (self-experimentation) to human trials to Nobel Prize. That was when pharma moved at the speed of software; that is what a landscape free for innovation can produce.<p>What if we tried that today?<p>You mean, just rely on the judgment of the experts involved and the verbal consent of the patients?<p>You mean, just allow the doctors to come up with whatever dose they felt warranted and patients to take whatever dose they feel comfortable with?<p>You mean, resist having some kind of ostensibly judicious central authority approve all such decisions, and rely on the distributed judgments of all consenting participants involved?<p>Yes. The typical response is that this is a recipe for anarchy. But history shows that it is a recipe for Nobel Prizes, and it is not like 1920s America was much like Somalia.<p>Would there be risk? Sure. Some people will not be helped and others might even harmed by new and unproven treatments. That's the price if we're serious about rapid progress, or really any progress. There must always be a first human trial; why not as soon as possible if people really are dying?<p>Needless to say, this kind of boldness won't fly in the modern US. Outside of the internet, the country has become just too risk averse, too wealthy to pay the price of progress. Our task as hackers then is to create at least one spot on this earth where patients can take whatever treatments they want, where entrepreneurs/technologists can invent whatever drugs/devices they want, and where no regulator has the power to intercede between these two consenting parties. And where we can go from idea to human trials as fast as the patient pleases.",1358761644

It's no use trying to list up all use cases of <i>for</i> that are safe and/or useful, and prohibit those that aren't. There is a trade off between designing all sorts of safety checks into a language and raw power, and C++ mostly errs on the side of raw power. Which is largely why it's so prevalent and dominant.<p>I own a pneumatic nail gun that has two rather rudimentary safety features in the form of a trigger lock and a switch near the end of the 'barrel' the prevents it from being activated without the barrel pressing against something (in normal use, the wood you're nailing). It's rudimentary and still accidents happen with nail guns. I sometimes purposely circumvent the safety measures to get something done, e.g. when I'm shooting nails under a weird angle. It would be possible to think of many more safety features - allowing the gun to be operated only when activated with two hands (preventing one from shooting in one's hand), having all sorts of electronics that detect the surface that is being shot into, etc. Not a single one of guns would get sold because they cripple the way you work too much to be convenient.",1358760788

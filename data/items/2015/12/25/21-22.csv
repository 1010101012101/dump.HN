10792474,comment,10792046,10792379,0,0,MaysonL,,,"Back in the &#x27;80s, I got tasked to implement a prototype distributed OS that a team at JPL had just spent all but a little less than a year of a 5 or 6 year DOD contract designing (with a bit more than 6 months to a big conference where it was supposed to be demoed). After I gave my estimate of what I could produce in the time remaining, the design team said that that was impossible. Modula-2 (embodied in a Logitech(!!) compiler and standard library) came through with flying colors. OS ran on 8 Vax 725&#x27;s. Pull the plug on one running unique processes, they would restart on another. Ditto for splitting the net.<p>[0] <a href=""http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA124379"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=ht...</a>",1451080583

10792471,comment,10790127,10790925,0,0,derefr,,,"Interesting. I&#x27;m guessing that only gets used by minor &quot;feature&quot; updates (to e.g. Webkit, or iTunes), and not the full &quot;OSX Update 10.11.x&quot; releases.<p>My suspicion is for anecdotal reasons: I recently Internet-restored my MBP. This pushed it back down to OSX 10.11.0, so it had quite a few OS point-updates to go install. But before I let it do any of those, I enabled FileVault2 and let it finish encrypting. I then had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of watching this sequence of events repeat itself several times, a sequence of events which had never occurred before El Capitan:<p>1. The OS asks to restart to install an update.<p>2. The OS reboots and sits at the (UEFI?) drive-unlock pretend-login screen until I enter my password.<p>3. The OS boots into something that looks like my &quot;regular use&quot; OS—the Menu Bar appears, the cursor appears and starts working, and my regular wallpaper is rendered—but the Finder doesn&#x27;t start, nor do any of my account&#x27;s Startup Items or LaunchAgents (not sure about global LaunchDaemons.)<p>4. The screen (still with HID cursor control enabled!) gets covered in a fullscreen <i>window</i> (not a fullscreened app taking up a Space; wrong transition effect) that has the appearance of a big black screen with an Apple logo and a progress bar. You know, like the boot screen, or iOS&#x27;s update mode, or a Mac&#x27;s UEFI firmware update mode. But it&#x27;s definitely just an app, running within whatever instance of OSX this is.<p>5. Having completed the update, the computer reboots again, I enter my drive-unlock password again, and I&#x27;m back into my regular-use session.<p>---<p>Previous to El Capitan, OSX Update packages would trigger a much simpler process, equivalent to the process Windows currently goes through:<p>1. Ask the user to &quot;reboot&quot;;<p>2. instead of rebooting, stop all userland processes and enter a single-user/maintenance runlevel;<p>3. run some special privileged (kext?) code that installs/unpacks/shoves the update and directly manipulates the framebuffer to render a progress bar;<p>4. actually reboot.<p>---<p>It wouldn&#x27;t make sense to change from the old process to the current one if it was just for the sake of putting the system into an SIP-disabled mode. Like you said, Apple-signed installers can flout SIP restrictions.<p>It only makes sense to add the extra reboot to the process if you&#x27;re rebooting into the recovery OS, because having the recovery OS do the work <i>is itself the goal</i>, rather than just an idea born out of necessity.<p>If you&#x27;re wondering about the &quot;still has my wallpaper&quot; part, though: it&#x27;s not unprecedented for the recovery OS to be &quot;fed&quot; data from the regular-use OS, so that there&#x27;s a continuity of control when you reboot into the recovery OS. For example, the recovery OS will receive a copy of any wi-fi AP keys you entered into the System keychain in the regular-use OS, so that you can re-install OSX even if you don&#x27;t remember your wi-fi password.<p>(I say &quot;will receive a copy&quot; instead of &quot;accesses&quot; because it gets these even if the regular-use OS is sitting in the FileVault2 &quot;locked&quot; state from the recovery OS&#x27;s perspective—or has already been blown away entirely—where it couldn&#x27;t possibly just mount the volume to read your System keychain. It seems to be more that the regular-use OS will push a copy of these thing over into the recovery OS when you update them.)",1451080473

However it is not the right way to sustain humans in space long term. It cost far too much, in fixed costs and per launch.<p>Longer:<p>If you look at old films on how piston powered airlines worked, the amount of staff needed was much larger than the amount of passengers and the trips were short. Hence by definition only few could afford long trips. It&#x27;s just mathematics. Everybody can&#x27;t be a lord with servants.\nOnly with modern jetliners the amount of work needed per seat mile dropped drastically, and travel became possible for the masses.\nSomething similar has to happen for space launch. We can&#x27;t have a significant portion of the population working in rocket factories / refurbishment shops / launch control, so it must be developed and streamlined a lot. In practice this means reusable rockets with high flight rates and low maintenance. Further out, we need to extract resources from space to drastically drop the needed amount to launch from Earth&#x27;s deep gravity well.<p>The whole Apollo architecture was a result of immature technology, short time table and large budgets. NASA should not try to repeat it, as the budget and the political drive are not there, and it didn&#x27;t result in anything long lasting the last time either. Instead, focus should be on lowering cost of more modest missions at first. The Space Shuttle attempted this, but it was too ambitious and inflexible. After they built the mammoth, all the money went into feeding it, and there was no money for developing new things.<p>&quot;“NASA is an organization that is dominated by fixed costs. In business terms everything is in the overhead,” he said. The committee found, with some effort, that the fixed cost of NASA’s human spaceflight program is $6–7 billion a year. “The bottom line is that they can’t afford to keep the doors open with they money they’ve got, let alone do anything with it.”&quot;<p>-Jeff Greason, more at:\n<a href=""http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1483/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1483/1</a>",1451079997

The parser has no lookahead (and even if it did, the required lookahead to avoid this is unboundedly large) -- you can&#x27;t tell, given your input, whether you should recurse or not.<p>Here&#x27;s a pretty simple grammar:<p><pre><code>    S -> A\n    A -> a\n    A -> A B (this is left recursion, a rule for producing A that itself begins with A)\n    B -> b\n</code></pre>\nThe language matches the same strings as the regular expression (a|ab+), that is, a single a followed by zero or more b&#x27;s.<p>So, suppose you&#x27;re the parser. You begin with the start rule, which tells you to expect an A. For the A, you have two choices: recur via the rule A -> A B, or stop recurring and process a literal a. You see the input &quot;a&quot;. How can you know which to do?<p>Compare the analogous right-recursive grammar, which matches (a|b+a):<p><pre><code>    S -> A\n    A -> a\n    A -> B A\n    B -> b\n</code></pre>\nHere, you start out expecting an A. When you see the input &quot;a&quot;, you know that the only way to make sense of it is to invoke the rule &quot;A -> a&quot;, which is a terminal rule. And when you see the input &quot;b&quot;, you know the only thing you can do is invoke the rule &quot;A -> B A&quot;, since that is the only rule allowing an A to begin with &quot;b&quot;.<p>edit: replaced regexes involving * with uglier regexes using disjunction and +, since HN doesn&#x27;t allow asterisks in most normal uses.",1451078742

Adding macros for low-overhead abstractions and a solid stdlib to that would give a differentiator in systems programming without learning curve of Rust or C++.<p>Go achieved some of this already in application language space.

The folks at Apple update the dev builds so frequently that in my experience it breaks things often enough that you&#x27;ll spend 50% of your time updating your code for a new build or waiting for dependencies to update their code.<p>And just to be clear I think that&#x27;s awesome. I love the work they&#x27;re doing; it&#x27;s just time consuming. I&#x27;ve been writing my own approach to a Swift MVC framework so this is something I&#x27;m experiencing firsthand:<p>Swerver: <a href=""https://github.com/jparishy/swerver"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jparishy/swerver</a> (example usage: <a href=""https://github.com/jparishy/swerverorg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jparishy/swerverorg</a> - it&#x27;s based on libuv and makes many choices for you a la Rails compared to the framework demoed in the OP)<p>and it has been way more time consuming that I would have expected going into it. And right now it doesn&#x27;t build on Linux because the latest Apple build broke something in CryptoSwift, which Swerver depends on.<p>All that said, Swerver has been super fun to work on so. After a lot of the hard work had been done, the actual usage (as demoed in jparishy/swerverorg with user authentication, client-side session state, and the basic MVC/DB access stuff) has been really smooth and enjoyable. /shamelessplug",1451077663

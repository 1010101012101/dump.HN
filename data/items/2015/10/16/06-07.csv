And it did indeed slightly worsen the traffic conditions in the area compared to the interregnum after it fell down in the Loma Prieta quake in 1989. Traffic is still worse that it would be if CDOT just closed it and turned it into an urban garden or walking path with views or something.<p>That&#x27;s not why it took so long to rebuild. The nine year process was the result of the usual corruption, insider jockeying, incompetence, bureaucracy, and lack of urgency from Bay Area government. The objections of CDOT and local residents that ardently opposed the freeway in their neighborhood were ignored and steamrollered as usual. Of course, the local officials, contractors, and CDOT shared and enjoyed the lucre from the $1,200,000,000 we all paid for the three mile connector.<p>Meanwhile the 1994 earthquake in LA triggered a special exception to the usual legal process where Gov Wilson could take personal responsibility for selecting a design, a contractor, a price, a schedule, and contract terms for rebuilding several segments of LA highway. They were all delivered on time and well under expected budget. Some were rebuilt in a couple months. No one had time to figure out if those could be beneficially abandoned.<p>And today Oakland and CDOT still cannot make the simple decision to admit error and close the 880 connector.",1444977407

This is the fastest way to learn what your team is talking about.<p>1.5 If you don&#x27;t understand something that&#x27;s being said at a meeting ask, but don&#x27;t hijack the meeting, make a note and talk to someone who can explain in more detail.<p>2. Think at a high-level -- what is the product supposed to be doing, abstract away -- some engineers will talk in code -- which you may not understand early on but interpret what they&#x27;re saying at a high-level.<p>4. Be available and approachable to everyone on the team.<p>5. Understand the impact of a bug fix or a feature -- how much QA effort does it require, what is the operational impact of the work, does it break backward compatibility etc.<p>6. Participate in product meetings and consider designing any new features as homework so you can better discuss it with the engineering team  you&#x27;re leading.<p>Good luck!<p><i>Edit</i><p>Some DO NOTs:<p>1.

In some cases, tools and controls that have fairly standard interface conventions in other imaging software are different in darktable.  The UI is generally less intuitive than C1 and LR.<p>On the technical side it does better, but can&#x27;t compare to C1 and LR.  A lot of the controls are difficult to use, and the effects don&#x27;t seem as &quot;smooth&quot; as C1 and LR, if that makes any sense.  It&#x27;s also a lot slower, and I&#x27;ll often make an adjustment and have &quot;working...&quot; show up over the image while it chugs away.  And I mean for simple stuff like adjusting levels and exposure, that take effect almost instantly in the other software.  To its credit, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any effect or feature in C1 or LR that couldn&#x27;t be achieved in DR, but it would usually be a lot more work.<p>Another problem I had was that RAW support seems to lag behind C1 and LR quite a bit, especially for cameras with new or unique sensors.  I have a FujiFilm with an XTrans sensor, and it took a long time for it to be supported in darktable.  On a similar note, it is pretty far behind on things like lens correction.<p>Overall I just get stuff done faster and easier in C1.",1444976971

This bolded line, for example:<p>>Rarely, though, will you ever hear a white person lamenting about working conditions that their black/brown child/spouse/sibling might have to endure, because they rarely have those relationships, so aren’t forced to develop empathy for brown/black people.<p>What working conditions? Care giving any examples? What are some pointers you could give to white people to help them understand your deplorable working conditions? Is it simply that there are no black speakers at conferences, or holding positions in these tech organizations?<p>Personal experiences, as well as experiences from my hispanic friends, point to no such implied &quot;bad working conditions.&quot; Some of my friends are brown-skinned and have noticeable accents. Most still use Spanish as their primary language, both on and offline. Yet there has been not one single incident involving either myself or any of my hispanic friends where we suffered any sort of discrimination, or experienced unwelcoming working conditions.<p>Maybe the author and I have different goals when we attend such conferences. Maybe there are more hispanics than blacks or native Americans in tech. Yet I don&#x27;t understand why that would matter when attending a conference.<p>>Yet for the 2015 conference, they could not manage to find one black woman to be a “headline” speaker. Two white men are included in the set of headline speakers at a conference celebrating women in technology, but not a single black woman.<p>It infuriates me to see this obsession with ethnic or racial background. This obsession with the color of the speaker&#x27;s skin. In my eyes, that the keynote speakers are white males does not invalidate their opinions in any way. There is no implied message that they speak on behalf of women, or minorities. It&#x27;s an invitation. It does not mean that they&#x27;re not qualified on the subject - if anything, these &quot;old white men&quot; are the ones running these big companies and are there not just to speak, but to also listen to the other speakers and the attendants.<p>I opened the videos linked in the article and I&#x27;ll try to skip through them and I&#x27;ll report back, hopefully. It just boggles my mind that in this day and age there is still this obsession with the speaker&#x27;s racial background. And there is no solution proposed, either, besides &quot;they should find more people of color to speak at these events.&quot; Isn&#x27;t that the one of the points of these conferences? And is there any progress being made, considering that last year&#x27;s was the first one Google organized? Did the author gather any information about this year&#x27;s? Does the author have any proposals or people she would like to see at these events?<p>I go to tech conferences to learn. My political and ethnic background is never, ever something that makes me biased against or for an event. It is also never a problem. My slightly noticeable accent, my hispanic facial features, my shirts with Spanish sentences, they do not have any effect on how people treat me.<p>It might all come down to what your goals are when attending any event.",1444976076

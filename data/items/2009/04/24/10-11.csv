If that fails and it's more than just assembling or moving a desk, I try to pay someone else nice to do it. I'm happy that our society somehow considers typing to be more important work than roofing.<p>I'm in my office around 45 hours a week.. somewhere around 5am-3pm M-F with probably 5 to 10 hours of errands, lunches, and lazy times cut out of that.<p>I'd say I average 2 hours a week right now writing out ""code"" that I'd describe as my ""work."" That seems insanely low, but given a good typing speed, that's enough to write the K&R C book in a month. I wish my quality were that high, but I'm trying.<p>I think at the office I'm probably down to ~10 hours a week of ""unproductive"" time now (e.g. reading this stuff, writing this comment, gossiping with friends about someone's date).",1240570209
577285,comment,576955,577037,0,0,cwan,,,"That's a double edged sword - if you've read their blogs, they don't have just one blog writer and at times writers actively disagree with each other.  It just gets downright bizarre.  Further, the lack of a byline also results in a lack of accountability/ability to deny responsibility.  Frankly, I've also found their quality has gone down over the last few years since writers like Megan McArdle left.",1240570109

It seems the media and the general public are beginning to become aware of the new ""meta-geek"" usage of the word ""hacker"" and it's subterranean counterpart.<p>I'm now lost in the ""problem"" (to paraphrase a recent post - ""programmers don't _love to code_ they _love to solve problems_) of how to eat an egg without braking the shell?<p>I think this should be a contest - best answer gets upvotes?<p>I think the primary assumptions of the problem must be thrashed out first.<p>1. The Egg is to be an average sized chicken egg - none of them quails jive!\n2. Eat: as in to consume the whole,\n3. Egg: as in the Yolk and the White (albumen for the l334)\n4.

Luckily, the term hacker has gradually come to be an umbrella term for a wide set of skills, capable of both good for evil, describing everything from building web apps to cracking DRM to security auditing, as well as the actually nefarious stuff.<p>(Of course, this ignores the reality that the majority of ne'er-do-wells have very little technical skill, but plenty of existing terms already fit the bill: fraudsters, vandals, thieves, etc.)",1240568990

It might only work 20% of the time, but that's good enough to get some spam accounts with URLs approved.<p>Of course this would all take effort, and might be enough to lock out a lot of would-be spammers, or at least convince them to go somewhere else.",1240568974

For legitimate users it's pretty easy to get one upvote on a comment and as a nice bonus it would raise the chance that the user has a basic grasp of community values.<p>For spam bots OTOH it's impossible to submit links before they get one upvote and it's impossible to upvote themselves before they get one upvote.

But here is what you can do to get started: political advertising is typically seasonal, it's not an election season (in the U.S.) so you can weather the storm by signing up for an Amazon affiliate account and selling political books. Your classifier function would be very simple, it's basically a parity predicate; someone is either right wing or left wing. Assign a probability that someone is, say, left wing, to a few conditions and add them up then divide by their count (frequentist statistics, bayesian system is even more powerful.) Once you determine what someone is, display a few amazon book ads in rotation. After a month or so, remove the least performing 1/2 of the books and ad new ones.<p>This is the dumbest and most straightforward ad delivery platform.

You can probably figure out the meaning of all three but in case not:<p>Cost plus is simple in that you calculate how much it cost you to make something and then charge more than that per unit, ideally with a margin you are happy with. Not too applicable to this situation, but if you want to think about it, take your hourly salary * # hours you spent on this for total cost. Figure out how many downloads you can realistically get at some price and then you go from there (hint, 99c is probably ok from this perspective).<p>Customer value pricing is much more of a nebulous science. Basically, you try to figure out how much value people attach to certain product characteristics or functionalities. In reality, you can observe customers, interview/survey them and do other experiments. From a more basic perspective ask yourself this: how big of a problem does my product solve and how important is that problem? The QuickOffice app solves a huge problem for me (I can't get my computer files or edit them on my iphone)and so I paid $9.99 for it. Angry birds solves a smaller problem (I'm bored for a few minutes) so I only pay 99c for it. How do you know how big of a problem you are solving? Ask yourself what a user would do if they didn't have your product: without QuickOffice, I would have to drive back to my house and get my laptop. With Angry Birds, I just read the news for a few minutes instead. With your app, I could foresee the problem being solved by manually entering the movie title.<p>For iPhone apps, competitive benchmarking is most important. Really, unless your app does something extraordinary, it should be 99c or free. However, in your case, I assume you might be doing doing this in order to learn. You will learn more if you get more downloads, and therefore more user data/feedback. Therefore, there may be greater value for you would be to put it out there for free.

2102697,comment,2102570,2102570,0,0,bluekeybox,,,"There is a very good reason why designers tend not to explain the specific details of design ""suckage"" but simply exclaim ""it sucks."" ""It sucks"" means that the design has to be thrown out, and one should generally start from scratch. What you're looking for, on the other hand, is an explanation that goes something like this ""ok, this part of your design is pretty good, but this one is the really sucky part, and it is sucky because you did so and so, and you only need to change this to so and so and you're good."" What you're looking for, in other words, is way to incrementally improve upon an existing design, which is the way engineering and software development is often done. Designers don't think like this. Designers frown upon incremental improvement, since it would imply (1) That design rules are being codified -- which is first of all hard since language used to describe the emotional associations this or that design evokes simply may not exist, and second of all may not be desirable since codification often means banalisation; (2) That design is not holistic -- which means it has some similarity to the dreaded case of a design by a committee (""ok, you do this part, I will do this part, and she will work on that part""), the end result of which is, as we all know, a camel, not a horse.<p>The best design is always holistic, which means that (1) <i>one and only one person</i> either completely designs everything or closely supervises the entire process, and (2) it is impossible to redesign any single part of the product without redesigning most if not all of the other remaining parts.<p>Therefore, in design, it is either ""it sucks balls; start over"" or ""this is groovy; rock on.""",1294983799

To explain it in full would take many hours verbally (it took me months in my program to even get up to speed on molecular biology, having come from a CS background).<p>I'll give some more detail, though: when I say ""specifically tuned to human physiology"" I mean ""tuned"" to an extreme level.  A human cell is a bag of water, protein, and nucleic acids enveloped by a lipid bilayer.  This lipid bilayer physically prevents anything larger than...I think a subset of very small molecules from entering the cell?  I am very weak in biochem, so I don't know the exact parameters around this, but I do know for certain that a virus is many orders of magnitude too large to just ""get in"" to a cell.<p>In order to gain entry to the cell, the virus has to have a protein that is extremely specifically targeted to a human protein that sits on the surface of a human cell.  Like, antibody-to-antigen level specific - this is the product of many many generations of evolution.  After attaching to that protein, the virus performs a very biochemically specific action to inject its payload into the cell.<p>> Their folding state _is_ the infection mechanism<p>Er, not really.  It's the infection mechanism once the prion is <i>in the cell</i> (since the proteins to which the infection spreads are in a cell).  How does the protein get in the cell in the first place?<p>...that's what nobody knows.  It can't just float in, again because of the lipid bilayer.  It needs to be actively pulled into the cell.

We specialize in disruptive technologies and business models, and we bring that knowledge to companies and organizations that are established and need to adapt or perish. We grew 300% last year, expecting the same this year, and this is a really exciting time to be with the company. You can feel electricity in the air around our offices.<p>We work with a variety of systems - we build pretty advanced platforms on Drupal (we're one of the only Enterprise Drupal partners in Canada), we build things from scratch with PHP/CodeIgnter, we build apps with Objective-C, etc. If you want to learn how to build wicked stuff and want to start a company somewhere down the line, this is a great place to work. Hell, you're even encouraged to work on a potential startup in your 15% time.<p>About you: Background in computer/software engineering or computer science is preferred, but we're open if you can demonstrate you know your stuff and have a nonconventional degree. We're looking for 1-2yrs experience (if you're fresh out of school get in touch anyway). Double points if you have startup experience.<p>We mostly work in PHP, but diverse language experience is a plus. It's more important that you're smart and driven than that you're a PHP expert. If you've played around with iOS development, HTML5, Python, Android dev, Facebook app dev, etc., those are all positives.<p>About the position: You'll be tasked with building important systems for interesting clients, with plenty of technical challenges and opportunities to learn as you go. You'll work in a Scrum team, primarily in PHP to start - you'll also likely learn how to build complex systems in Drupal.<p>If you're a startup guy/gal, you'll learn a lot just by being in our environment. You'll collide with amazingly smart developers, designers, analysts, and business folk - all of whom are constantly formulating new business models and thinking radical thoughts about the future. Bonus points if you like to endlessly philosophize.<p>Perks: Benefits (drug, dental, massage, etc.), 15% time (take a half day a week to build awesome stuff), relocation (if you're not located in the GTA), technical books (if you want 'em, you can have 'em), conferences, training.<p>Pay: We have a saying that goes like this: ""Hire 5 people who can do the work of 10 and get the pay of 8"". We want smart, driven developers, and we pay what it takes to get them.<p>How to apply: Email dustin (at) myplanetdigital (dot) com",1294981669

There are innumerable instances of non-programmers building great business. And especially while churning out your MVP, you could do much worse than outsourcing your product and instead, driving sales.\nThere is a bloated sense of elitism in writing your own code - while I certainly subscribe to ""once a geek, always a geek"" personality, the insistence that the CEO/CFO/CXO should be a coder is not entirely healthy.<p>I run an outsourcing business and our first few (and currently one) customer are Silicon Valley startups, some of which got acquired in the course of time. And we are not expensive - the lowest we have gone is 1/3rd the silicon valley salary rate for a 10 year experienced engineer (this was when the project was large enough).<p>As far as India is concerned, I have had an interesting discussion with @plinkplonk over here - India has orders of magnitude more people and engineers than most other countries. So yes, there is a high signal-to-noise ratio to finding people... not unusual in any large economy. \nWhen comparing skill levels to countries like Eastern Europe, I will admit you have a better chance of finding good engineers there, just because you need to be very good to be able to make money like that. [[ Read what I just wrote AGAIN - I didnt say europeans are better than indians in general. I said YOU would have a better chance at finding them in a smaller place.]]<p>I wouldnt presume to go and tell you how to go and find your employees/outsourcing partners, but remember this: At the end of the day, India has a huge talent pool - in this day of an overheated Silicon Valley/NY job market, how do you go about leveraging this talent pool ? Use the fact that a good Indian salary is a fraction of American salary - these are the same people who migrate to silicon valley and pull a Vinod Khosla or Ram Shriram.

197672,comment,197525,197579,0,0,KirinDave,,,"It's quite popular among some hacker circles. It's generally a useful service.<p>I'd say the majority of people aren't devoted fanatically to it like the fame-on-a-budget blogger2.0 crowd is. People like Arrington are so frantic about Twitter because it's become of their better platforms for building a user base. When it goes down, their business actually suffers, crazy as that seems.<p>For me, it's just a sidechannel to organize meetings (like at a conference) or a place to find/report interesting papers/posts/manuals/libraries. I think the majority of twitter users are like me in this regard: we aren't defining a metric of success by how many Twitter followers we have. In this capacity I find it acceptable, and the downtime is only a minor nuisance that I often don't notice because I just don't tweet that often.",1211500635

Turn off the alerts, visit Twitter once or twice a day and catch up. Catching up on Twitter is pretty easy because everything is <i>very very short</i> by necessity.<p>Web usability guys like Jacob Nielsen have been saying for a decade that the essence of writing for the web is microcontent -- we should all stop writing paragraphs and concentrate all our energy on writing decent titles and headlines. Well, Twitter is a <i>machine for forcing people to write good headlines</i> and nothing else. As a result, I find it wastes far less of the reader's time than any other web technology to date.",1211500014

Yes.<p>Are people upvoting because Twitter's design has just been sitting there, right in front of our faces, for <i>years</i>, and yet we plugged away on email and IM and static HTML sites and blogs and Facebook and never even thought of trying something like this, so we're fascinated to discover it in the same way that biologists were fascinated to discover the platypus? Yes.<p>Are people upvoting because they're still trying to understand what Twitter is, and how to build something like it themselves, but they're confused because it isn't really email, or IM, or a microblog, or Facebook? Yes.<p>Do half the folks on news.yc look at Twitter and see something that they simultaneously crave (a startup with a viral app) and fear (a startup with a viral app that is pissing off its customers) and envy (because the customers moan, and they complain, but <i>they don't abandon Twitter for the alternatives</i>, at least not yet)? So, try as they might, the entrepreneurs can't possibly look away?<p>Yes.",1211499679

197658,comment,197634,197634,0,0,andrewdotnich,,,"There are many things that make Twitter special, but the main ones for me are:<p>1) The asynchronous nature of Twitter networks models real life quite well - you might be interested in everything a person has to say, but they don't even know/care about you. This works with Twitter, because following is a one-way concept.<p>2) This makes it hard to get spammers onto Twitter, because the only way for spammers to get their posts listened to is by having people follow them. Also, services like the Twitter Black list exist to help people sort the wheat from the chaff.<p>3) The best ""feature"" of Twitter is its tabula rasa attitude to what you post - as long as it fits in 140 characters, Twitter doesn't care. This has allowed people to build fun minigames (@lyricbot), query/response info bots (@weatherbot), and plug Twitter into their external apps (Remember the Milk, Buxfer, etc). This sets Twitter apart from something like Pownce, which had a similar idea (complete with the asynchronous fan/friend model). The difference (IMO) was that Pownce tried to impose some sort of order on its users, which limited the way it could be used.",1211499577

Austin is always mentioned as a ""startup hub"", but living here it doesn't really feel that way. Maybe that can change. We tend to take more pride in our live music scene, which is great :).<p>I think Austin is awesome and there are very smart and creative folks here, but there aren't gigantic conferences every other weekend or a huge concentration of VC's. I do see plenty of folks in coffee shops with TextMate, vi, or Photoshop open. They are usually working on something cool, it's just not hyped up on TechCrunch and such.",1211499202
197656,comment,197634,197634,0,0,shimon,,,"Twitter articles are popular here, as in other social news sites and blogs, because of selection bias.  Who likes twitter?  People who always have something to write.  Who posts stuff on the web?  People who always have something to write.  It's the same reason most of the people who apply for a job are idiots, because they just have to do it over and over.<p>Overall, I think Twitter resembles the conference circuit.  A small circle of people dominate the crowd's attention, largely by talking voluminously among themselves.  You might be able to learn something new, but you'll have to filter out a lot of noise.  And you're probably better served by finding a person or two and having an actual conversation, or writing an essay, or actually doing some work instead of being interrupted every few minutes.",1211499074

Every intelligent creature in this universe has to be able to do the same basic things: reproduce, manipulate objects, fend off predators, etc.<p>There's a theory, commonly used in economics and international relations, that competitive pressures force most groups at the apex of a system to think, act, and behave pretty much the same. For example, during the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States, despite their radically different concepts of how to run a government, each behaved roughly the same on the international stage.  They built coalitions and acted pretty much universally in self-interest.<p>The same principle probably applies to organisms.  The same competitive pressures probably force intelligent organisms to develop similar mental frameworks.<p>This isn't to say that ET will look anything like us.  Just that he'll probably understand patterns, numbers, and the like, because understanding those things are what this universe rewards.",1211497418

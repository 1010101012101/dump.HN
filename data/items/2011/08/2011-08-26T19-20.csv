2929763,comment,2928951,2929648,16,0,phaus,,,"There is no way this laptop is competitively priced with Alienware and MSI. For about $1200 you can get an Alienware with the same GPU(which accounts for 90 percent of your framerate). For under 1500 you can get an MSI or Asus laptop with a GTX 560M which is significantly better than the GT 555M. If you actually wanted a high-end gaming system you could go all out and get a M18X Alienware with dual 6990M GPUs. Just so we can rule this out as a gaming computer once and for all, here is a performance comparison.<p>$2880 Razer ""gaming"" computer - GT 555M Bad Company 2 Ultra Settings - 17-20 FPS
$1799 Alienware M17X with single 6990M - Bad Company 2 Ultra Settings - 57-59 FPS

I've recently ported my 2nd highest selling iPhone app to Android. Here is a comparison for the first 2 weeks of sales. If other iOS developers are out there that are thinking of porting to android, I hope this may be of help.<p>To keep things fair I'm only comparing one version of my paid iphone app to its android equivalent (Fantasy Football Monster '11). This does not include any ad revenue, in app purchases or iPad sales.<p>Date         Android  iPhone<p>Aug 25, 2011 $177.67  $420<p>Aug 24, 2011 $261.30  $382<p>Aug 23, 2011 $386.68  $386<p>Aug 22, 2011 $447.26  $425<p>Aug 21, 2011 $422.18  $585<p>Aug 20, 2011 $280.06  $403<p>Aug 19, 2011 $211.09  $352<p>Aug 18, 2011 $194.37  $388<p>Aug 17, 2011 $357.39  $342<p>Aug 16, 2011 $463.99  $330<p>Aug 15, 2011 $384.55  $407<p>Aug 14, 2011 $376.20  $483<p>Aug 13, 2011 $263.34  $502<p>Aug 12, 2011 $209.00  $508<p>Total            $4428.08 $5914<p>Per Day          $316.29  $422.43<p>So, overall the android version of my app makes about 75% of its iPhone equivalent. This is significantly better than I expected.<p>One more data point. The android app is currently about 250ish overall top paid, and the iPhone version is 350ish. Take from that what you will.<p>Some quick observations about android from an iOS developer's perspective:<p>1) I think developing <i>quality</i> apps is easier on iOS. I'm actually a Java/.NET developer by profession so I should naturally be biased toward Android. But once you get past the initial learning curve, I think that Cocoa Touch APIs get you 90% of the way there, whereas Android APIs get you about 30% of the way there. That is to say, if you want a lot of the nice UI touches you're used to on the iphone, you'll have to spend much more effort getting there on Android. The main advantage I feel Android has is memory management, but the reference counting method that Objective-C uses is second nature once you are familiar with the fundamentals.<p>2) Android gives you REAL TIME sales analysis. This is pretty incredible. Yes you can somewhat simulate this on iPhone using 3rd party analytics, but being able to see the moment someone bought your app just brings my obsession with checking sales and stats to another level. You also get your daily reports much sooner (about 12:30AM PST as opposed to 5-6AM PST).<p>3) Android market screws up orders quite a bit. In fact, almost 20% of all orders are declined or cancelled due to some android market error. After checking forums, it seems like this is not unusual. Now, I don't know if this means I have 20% lost sales, but still disturbing nonetheless. In android's defense, apple actually never gives you this level of detail. To my knowledge, you don't know if users can't buy your app due to an app store error. But judging from the fact that we get e-mails about this issue every other day on android and I've never gotten a single e-mail about this in the past 15 months I've been on the app store is very telling. Google has GOT to fix this. Developers lose, customers lose, and google loses.<p>In conclusion, I feel like the Android Market has really come into its own. The common wisdom that android owners do not pay for apps is demonstrably false. They may not pay as much per user for apps as iPhone owners, but the enormous marketshare Android commands is just too much to ignore.<p>I'll try to address any questions or comments in a timely manner, but I'm currently in Europe so please forgive me I don't get to all of them.

It's not terribly difficult and it's not that interesting, it's just annoying.</i><p>It is not clear what you think is annoying (eg. learning the theory or writing a parser). I take it from later on in the post you believe writing the parser is annoying. I don't think writing parsers is in general annoying, but there are some languages which are annoying to write a parser for.<p>I can't agree with your advisor's statement about it being only a ""character building"" exercise. There are times when you need to write a parser. However, I have to admit if I can get around it I will. For instance last year instead of writing a Java parser I hooked the OpenJDK parser and serialized out an AST. Much easier and a lot less code than a parser. I would <i>always</i> recommend doing something like this for an existing language.

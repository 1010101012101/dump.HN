7058940,comment,7055226,7058427,1,0,Ygg2,,,"If scientist were getting twice as fast, I doubt it would make a difference. As I said, ok scientist are twice as fast, but can they think of a novel solution twice as fast? What is the last great physics discovery that was by a single (wo)man? Why are there no medals in sciences now won mostly by teams?<p>Again I don&#x27;t think it won&#x27;t reach super human levels. I just don&#x27;t think the Singularity is within next thousand years (I&#x27;d say several thousands but I don&#x27;t want to underestimate humans).<p>Progress in AI (or other sciences), to me seems more like an Evolutionary Boom, followed by long periods of nothing. Basically lots of information about how &#x27;X&#x27; works piles up on a floor until someone or something picks it up and sorts it into a neat pile that explains lots of stuff, then more and more stuff piles up and now we need even smarter person(s) to sort that problem.<p>I suspect that is because the pile of data to sort out is getting bigger and bigger and bigger, so that no single human can filter it any more. You now need teams and computers and God knows what else to make a breakthrough.\nIf for breakthrough of same magnitude you need more smart people than you did before, means that problems we&#x27;re dealing now got harder.<p>Another thing that strikes me is that perhaps the thing that contributes to discovery of how Intelligence works isn&#x27;t the same thing as intelligence. I.e. we&#x27;re making our computers faster but not smarter. We assume that speed of thought is all, but what if there is a choke-point, like entropy? Chaos and randomness are essential to with creativity and discovering novel solutions. So basically we make our computers 20 times more intelligent, but they aren&#x27;t chaotic enough to find what fixes them.",1389725869

It&#x27;s mostly for funding porn productions, but there&#x27;s also been video games and other things. The problem with offbeatr is that there are a BUNCH of up front fees (to offset the usual chargeback scares associated with sex projects), as well as an odd 3 round process to get your project approved. Furries do seem to love it, which seems to get their projects over the 3 round issue since they know their fanbase will always vote things through.<p>Concentrating on LovePalz is weird because while they /claim/ to have been rejected by kickstarter, no one from KS will ever confirm this, and their launch was a MASSIVE failure that would&#x27;ve caused lots of bad press were it more publicized (<a href""http://www.slashdong.org/2013/06/03/lovepalz-ships-also-doesnt-also-now-in-beta"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.slashdong.org/2013/06/03/lovepalz-ships-also-does...</a>)<p>More articles on sex crowdfunding:<p><a href""http://www.slashdong.org/2012/11/28/would-you-like-some-making-fuck-crowdfunding-sex-projects"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.slashdong.org/2012/11/28/would-you-like-some-maki...</a>\n<a href""https://medium.com/boinkology-101/ffbadb214ac"" rel""nofollo"">https://medium.com/boinkology-101/ffbadb214acb</a>",1389725800

They benefit too much from the exchange with the US (at least that&#x27;s what they think). Remember, the NSA is not supposed to spy on US citizens, just as the German BND is not supposed to spy on Germans. So they spy on each other&#x27;s citizens and exchange the information.<p>So far so good for Merkel and friends. What probably upsetted them was that the German government was spied upon, too. Also, they were just second-grade allies, and the US was probably trading information with the UK for example, which they didn&#x27;t share with the Germans (see the &quot;Five Eyes&quot; agreements). But it&#x27;s hard to believe that any of this is news to the German government, if their intelligence agencies are any of their money worth.<p>So the big question is, why do they tolerate being spied on? I know, diplomacy is complicated, and you have to make a lot of delicate compromises, and there is a lot that you can&#x27;t see from outside.<p>Nevertheless... Espionage is already punishable in Germany. If a German citizen is involved, they might even be charged with treason.

It&#x27;s unfortunate as many companies use Trello and as they grow they&#x27;re locked into certain frustrating behaviors that create all sorts of painful workarounds and manual processes to cope. For example, it would be nice to have sub-cards, or the ability to break cards out into different pieces as is usually necessary with user stories with tasks. It would also be nice to turn checklists into their own cards, rather than creating a new card and then adding checklist from a different card.<p>It would also be nice to be able to multiple select cards, move cards to top, move cards to bottom, etc, etc. I won&#x27;t even get into reporting. I could go on and on.<p>Anyway, these are definitely welcome improvements, but Trello for me is still far from being a really useful workflow management tool.",1389725431

The generally better way to cover externalities is by propertization (so a carbon AUCTION - and not cap-and-trade which has all sorts of politically motivated loopholes and subsidies - would be smarter than a carbon TAX).  Furthermore there are plenty of activities that incur externalities (such as homelessness) which we probably <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be taxing.<p>An even better way to correct externalities is to stop making them externalities through social action - get people to value things like companies that destroy the environment less.

7058815,comment,7057522,7058393,42,0,Fomite,,,"It isn&#x27;t actually a &quot;lack of understanding&quot; - I was doing research into phage therapy over a decade ago, and the field has progressed since then.<p>There are however a number of problems with phage therapy, and this is from the perspective of someone who <i>likes</i> phage therapy:<p>- Phages are usually very bacteria specific, there isn&#x27;t really a &quot;broad spectrum&quot; phage. The therapy used in Russia and Georgia is often a bespoke formulation for each individual patient. This is:<p>a. Really, really hard for the FDA to approve.\nb. Expensive as all hell.\nc. Involves keeping &quot;banks&quot; of phages around, and creating custom cocktails of them. This is, as mentioned, expensive as hell, and manpower intensive.<p>- Phage therapy is fairly novel in the West, due to some problems in the early days of phage therapy followed swiftly by the discovery of penicillin. It&#x27;s an entirely different method of treatment, which means all the clinical knowledge doctors currently have is invalid, and has to be relearned. That&#x27;s tough.<p>- There&#x27;s no promise a bacteria <i>has</i> a phage associated with it, and synthetic phages are, at this point, a pretty distant prospect.<p>- When bacterial cell walls rupture, they create endotoxins. Endotoxins are bad - indeed, in the early experiments with phage therapy in the West, insufficiently pure phage solutions with endotoxins in them were responsible for some deaths. Right now, phage therapy is most often used in dire cases, where side effects like that are less of a thing. For a bad case of Strep throat? There&#x27;s some serious clinical trials that need to be done.<p>- It&#x27;s a hell of a lot harder to give someone a 14 day course of bacteriophages to take home than it is a 14 day course of antibiotics.<p>Phage therapy is a really fascinating field, and I think it has a lot of potential. But to say we shun them due to a lack of understanding, or acting like what the Russians and Georgians do is &quot;utter sorcery&quot; ignores a great deal of the research that takes place here. The real problem is, even while we struggle with resistance, antibiotics are <i>profoundly</i> superior as a general purpose drug. The reasons the Russians used them so heavily is because they had trouble getting antibiotics.<p>But seriously, &quot;What about phages?&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly a new idea.",1389724787

7058795,comment,7058794,7058794,1,0,possibilistic,,,"(Continued from text post)<p>First of all, I&#x27;m wondering if you guys think this is a viable idea for a Kickstarter project. I believe this would function like an artistic grant. By the project&#x27;s end, several cities would get an unusual and unique, completely interactive light display.<p>In order to deliver a beautiful finished project, I&#x27;ll need to draw lots of complex geometry. This requires that I raise the money necessary in order to build several high-quality projectors to comprise a distributed multi-projection array. I may need to build between 10 to 20 units to support a large-scale game, and I&#x27;ll need a few Core i7 machines to coordinate lots of simultaneous I/O. It&#x27;s not cheap, but the results would be astounding.<p>I&#x27;ll need to work up a few different hardware configurations that can be funded at different levels depending on donor interest. The projectors I have now cost about $1,300/each. The components are neither bright nor precise, and you can see that in my videos.<p>I think a sweet spot is a $3,000-$5,000 build per projector as I&#x27;ll need a lot more Wattage, better color, vastly improved beam collimation, high speed, and high scan angle. Another possibility would be to get a fewer number of super fast and bright projectors ($10,000) and support that with many more lower quality units (such as mine) that would be used for projectile and particle effects. Additionally there&#x27;s the DACs and computational hardware to budget for, but that&#x27;s modest in comparison to building the projector array.<p>With this hardware, I propose building several of the following games:<p>- Tetris<p>- Tetris Attack<p>- Breakout<p>- Donkey Kong<p>- Space Invaders<p>- Galaga<p>- Ikaruga-like shoot &#x27;em up<p>- A shoot &#x27;em up where you play against your own scanned face/image<p>- (There are probably a lot of additional games that can be suggested for this list.)<p>Some of these games might have legal/licensing issues attached that I&#x27;ll have to investigate, so generic or completely novel ideas might be chosen instead.<p>In addition to programming games for the projectors, I am also interested in building an interactive canvas that would allow local artists (or kids or whomever is interested) to draw on the buildings. Painting with lasers is a really neat experience.<p>To make this even more of a community experience, I&#x27;ll post weekly or twice-weekly videos detailing the experiments, algorithms, personal anecdotes and lessons, hardware build progress, etc. And although I&#x27;d be building code for an array of projectors (as opposed to a single projector), I could provide code access for those with projectors or for those who want to build one and experiment for themselves.<p>Further, I could release a multiprojection emulator that allows other game devs to build for the platform. I&#x27;ll be building an emulator for multi-projection to support my own work anyway, so I may as well open source it.<p>Does this sound feasible or ridiculous?<p>If you think it could work, I&#x27;m also mulling over what kind of rewards would be good to offer to donors. This isn&#x27;t strictly a &quot;product&quot;, so that may be one of the biggest pitfalls with funding a project like this.<p>Some ideas I have are as follows:<p>- Standard t-shirt, &quot;name in credits&quot;, etc.<p>- Project your name, graphic, or (appropriate) message onto a building (with approval)<p>- Build and deliver a 1W, 30Kpps laser projector (EE isn&#x27;t my specialty, so I couldn&#x27;t offer this in bulk -- although I could team up with an EE colleague)<p>- Travel to an event and project laser video games or custom shows<p>- Travel to a corporate launch party or company event and project stuff (a higher end reward)<p>- Write a game inspired by an arcade game of your choice (a very high end reward as it would take time)<p>Some of the &quot;stretch goals&quot; I could offer might be:<p>- Live stream skyscraper gaming on Twitch or another service<p>- Internet-enabled socket-based, live-streaming skyscraper gaming on Twitch or another service<p>- Turn a building into a Twitter feed<p>- Turn a building into an interactive drawing canvas (possibly internet-enabled) as detailed above<p>- Write an NES emulator or at least duplicate some simple games<p>- Travel to various cities as voted on by the donors (and with proper building approval)<p>- Publish the low level interface that works with several DACs as open source<p>- Publish a higher-level graphics engine<p>- Open source everything<p>I think this could be accomplished in a 6-10 month time frame, with certain interactive milestones being accomplished in spring, others coming online in summer, with ultimate completion of all of the tasks by fall.<p>What do you guys think? Could this be a viable Kickstarter project? How would you go about setting this up? Can you think of better rewards/offers? Is there a better angle to market this idea?<p>I really want to do this, but is it just an unrealistic flight of fancy?<p>Thanks, HN!",1389724629

I was the sole developer of a medical messaging service, and the owners just raised half a million dollars (or a figure pretty close to that). Over the New Year they moved the development to a large firm in Seattle. The specifics don&#x27;t really matter, and I&#x27;ve got nothing against them. The worst of this is a case of bad timing; I was initially told I could finish up with my cs/biochem degree, but it looks like that&#x27;s out of the question for now.<p>In my spare time prior to being laid off, I&#x27;ve been (slowly) working on a few projects. One of them is a science show that is in pre-production, and the other involves crafting laser video games that are projected onto very tall buildings. I&#x27;m wondering if there might be a possibility to Kickstart the laser project and work on it full-time.

Something which can&#x27;t be implemented in an open source way. A plugin like Silverlight is no necessity for the web and if Silverlight is crappy and dying then that&#x27;s really a problem of its users and Netflix. It shouldn&#x27;t be my problem as a non-Netflix user. If the Web however starts to depend on such a crappy binary blob (which is the result of the EME proposal) then we all have to suffer and it will be a problem for us all.<p>In other words: If Netflix insists on DRM then they should write their own crappy plugins and applications but not ruin the open Web for all of us.<p>> You&#x27;re acting like DRM didn&#x27;t exist on the web prior to EME, and would continue not existing without EME.<p>No, we are not. We are just saying that EME will make the open Web depend on crappy proprietary binary blobs and hence no longer be open or libre.<p>> It existed and continues to exist using proprietary software that is shoved down users&#x27; throats.<p>EME is exactly that! It&#x27;s proprietary crap software which is forced down everybody&#x27;s throat because it makes the former open Web depend on it. It&#x27;s not only something Netflix customers will have to deal with. It&#x27;s something every web browser and web implementation has to deal with somehow.

Circuit has a very different docket composition. Certain kind of appeals are much easier and quicker to resolve than others: criminal sentencing appeals, habeas petitions, immigration appeals, routine civil matters like foreclosures or certain benefits awards, etc. While the D.C. Circuit does hear these sorts of cases, it does so only for the ~600k people in the District of Columbia. The other circuits, on the other hand, have a much larger number of these cases because they cover several states and usually 20-35 million people each.<p>The D.C. Circuit&#x27;s docket consists very disproportionately of highly complex regulatory appeals, which take much more time than simpler types of cases. These cases are not only often very factually complex, but of a nature that leaves more scope for appellate review. Roughly speaking, when a circuit court reviews the factual findings or discretionary actions of a lower court, it does so deferentially. E.g. an appellate court reviews sentences imposed by a district court only for abuse of discretion. However, a circuit court reviews the legal conclusions of a lower court from scratch (de novo).

I do hereby take your bait.<p>Now for the points I would like to make, primarily for the benefit of the few who <i>actually</i> think as you claim to think:<p>Women are actually similar to men in a number of novel ways.<p>We have eyes, and those eyes are intricately connected to very powerful and compact organic computers—capable of independent thought—called brains.<p>That&#x27;s right, men and women can both have brains.<p>And those of us women fortunate enough to be blessed with brains are quite capable not only of independent thoughts, but even decision-making. And yet another way in which we women are similar to men is that each of us, as individuals, comes to have certain aptitudes, preferences and values.<p>Some of us, like myself, discover to their amazement that they can understand mathematics and even think mathematically about pretty much anything, and develop an interest in technology and computation because of the possibilities it opens up for mathematics and because of the ways mathematics can reflexively provide insights into computer science and programming.<p>Other women have an aptitude/preference for: polishing nails; answering telephones; designing cute little things that men can give to women at Christmas; and so on. Are women like myself a minority? Perhaps, but it isn&#x27;t because we have to be shown things like maths and programming with striking adverts, responsive websites and pretty flyers.<p>I&#x27;m not going to pretend that society has been engineered into a patriarchy, over thousands of years, as part of a sinister plot by the Illuminati to preclude the success and independence of the children of the mother-goddess.<p>I&#x27;m likewise not going to pretend to think that there are men with power who purposefully keep women from rising up, or give preferential treatment to male candidates for scholarships/whatever without even realising it. Because ultimately I have no proof of such things and neither do I care about some male-dominant society, because in my experience, what matters is the talent; if you have it, if you have an original idea, a way how to implement it, or if you&#x27;re simply the best at what you do, you will succeed if you want to, male or female. I do not care why my boss, my clients or my investors choose me, I just want the opportunity to do what I do best, what I like doing.<p>If you think women simply haven&#x27;t been exposed to the magical and fun possibilities of mathematics and computers, think again. If women were ignorant to these fields and what they involve, they wouldn&#x27;t laugh at you for being a &quot;nerd&quot; or date muscular/rich guys instead of you.<p>They know what maths is, and they know what programming is, and they&#x27;ll never want to visit a forum and tell everyone how awesome it was when they elegantly solved some mathematical problems or came up with a new proof for some random theorem. They will on the contrary yearn to talk about shoes, interior design, literature, art, perfume, TV shows, movies, diets and so on.<p>The select few women who prefer mathematics/compsci and find it genuinely fun and inspiring were already posting on newsgroups, were already on IRC, were already subscribed to ars technica and slashdot on google reader, were already here; and they are already here; or they will be here in the future, or wherever else that such subjects can be discussed in the future.<p>It is not a case of marketing the idea to a mass of women who have no idea what makes their iPhone so useful, or how their cars&#x27; brakes are engineered. Women do not go to fashion forums and tell everyone about how much I wish I could expose men to the glories of haute couture. Women do not tell their nutritionists how much they wish they could entice their male friends with raw food diets and veganism.<p>There are the lost, unwashed masses who will never amount to anything, who will become a carbon copy of their parents and aspire to nothing beyond some repetition-of-basic-tasks job in an office or in retail, and the members of these masses are of both genders. You will fail to &quot;market&quot; math/compsci to these people, regardless of gender, because they cannot do it. Women who aspire to something and want to succeed do not generally want to do it with math and programming.<p>So, to all of you who think women need to have math/compsci marketed to them: kindly stop talking crap and just ignore the gender issue.

7058577,comment,7057964,7058365,4,0,kasey_junk,,,"Having made the choice between Clojure and Scala many times, always in favor of Scala, here are the 3 main reasons I keep going back to Scala (even though I don&#x27;t particularly like it):<p>1. I like type systems. I want strong typing, I&#x27;d prefer stronger typing in Scala (ie purity constraints as type information etc).  I don&#x27;t want optional typing (if I need dynamic interop, I can make a case for opt-out typing, but I&#x27;ve never needed).<p>2. Performance.  I spend a lot of time dealing with performance issues, specifically latency & throughput.  I often have to back off of idiomatic Scala to achieve these goals (especially when it comes to GC pressure).  Scala makes that easy & painless.  Clojure doesn&#x27;t.<p>3. Style (purely subjective). I don&#x27;t like LISP style languages.  My very first experience in programming is in Scheme, so it&#x27;s not that, I just don&#x27;t like how they look.  It&#x27;s fine for other folks to like them, different strokes and all that, but I don&#x27;t like it.<p>There are a ton of things I don&#x27;t like about Scala, but for me and my projects, right now, if I&#x27;m targeting the JVM it is the best choice and Clojure isn&#x27;t even second.",1389722674

9338716,comment,9338408,9338408,0,0,badthingfactory,,,"I&#x27;ve been on three different teams in my career and each had different needs in terms of daily stand ups.<p>team 1)\nAt my first job I had a manager who spent his entire day putting out fires. I would sometimes go weeks without speaking to him. During that time, I would run out of work, be waiting on meetings he was supposed to arrange, work on the exact same piece of work as another programmer, fall asleep in my chair, etc. That team desperately needed a 5 minute meeting in the morning just so I could touch base with him and let him know what I needed and stay on task.<p>team 2)\nMy second job was at a large company. Stand ups were regularly derailed by one or two people droning on about trivial details. The room had white noise generators which made it impossible to hear soft-spoken introverts (almost all of us). Management used it as a platform to inform us how to properly fill in time sheets and that was probably the most useful information anyone ever gained out of those meetings.<p>team 3)\nMy current team is small with several remote employees. We communicate regularly through various channels on Slack. We recently decided to sync up once a week, and that seems to work well. Daily stand ups have been considered, but it really feels like a solution seeking a problem.<p>I&#x27;m personally not a fan of the daily stand up. Team 1 needed them, but only because the manager wouldn&#x27;t take 5 minutes away from his insane excel macros to check up on the team. While the meetings did nothing for me on team 2, I do think they were helpful for management. Team 3 has no need for a lot of the same reasons outlined in this blog post.",1428465528

9338707,comment,9335612,9336251,0,0,analog31,,,"A couple of reasons might be: Motivation, and political power.<p>&quot;Motivation&quot; is the idea that certain factors motivate people to compete harder in the workplace. One of those factors is having kids. A colleague of mine was dissatisfied with his advancement, and I suggested that he should become a project manager. His response: &quot;Why should I take that horrible job when my engineer job lets me go home at 5 every day?&quot; He had no kids, but lots of social activities.<p>An amusing story about motivation at my workplace, a Fortune 500 company, is that our management jobs tend to be pretty thankless, even if they pay more. Everybody I&#x27;ve known who has applied for those jobs, has kids.<p>I&#x27;ve read that after the birth of their first kid, there&#x27;s a 50% chance that a worker will change jobs in pursuit of higher pay. I also read about a study of unskilled, single women living in the south side of Chicago. Those with kids tended to earn higher wages, and traveled further to their jobs, than those without.<p>It may be that the choice is not so much children versus art, but career versus art.<p>Providing family benefits might be one way to effectively pay people more without creating an overt caste system where all of the higher level jobs are held by people with kids.<p>Political power relates to motivation. From what I&#x27;ve read, people with kids tend to vote. Unsurprisingly, we vote our interests. And there are certain interests that can only be met, within our system, by influencing employers.",1428465261
9338706,comment,9338071,9338368,0,0,deathanatos,,,"I have mixed feelings about that article.<p>To get anything done, I feel like the general programmer[1] is allowed to assume, at a bare minimum, a Proleptic Gregorian calendar. Anything else just makes handling early (pre-Gregorian) dates madness. (Various geographical locations adopted the calendar at different times, so you end up needing to know where you are to compute the &quot;local&quot; date. Even further back in history the rules get even more odd, and unknown. [2], if I read it correctly, includes a table of when scholars _think_ people inserted leap years.)<p>Once you go with &quot;Proleptic Gregorian calendar&quot;, I think points such as<p>> Months have either 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.<p>…are actually always true. Of course, two bullets down is,<p>> There is only one calendar system in use at one time.<p>Which is essentially what we&#x27;re using as axiom here.

9338702,comment,9338408,9338618,0,0,claar,,,"&quot;Self-starter&quot; is one of many good qualities for a developer. Here are some others off the top of my head:<p><pre><code>  * Creative\n  * Detail-oriented\n  * Outside-the-box-thinker\n  * Insightful\n  * Meticulous\n</code></pre>\n.. and so on. I&#x27;ve found that with any such list, people will already excel in some, and still be growing in the others. Oftentimes these attributes are contrary to each other -- your most creative developer is probably not your most detail-oriented developer, for instance.<p>If you restrict your hires to all excel in a single attribute, such as &quot;self-starter&quot;, you may be missing out on some fantastic developers who excel in other things.<p>In short, some of your developers may very well find daily accountability to be helpful, and this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they aren&#x27;t fantastic developers in other ways.",1428465042

9338661,comment,9291215,9294708,0,0,deathanatos,,,"Sorry about the slow reply. We&#x27;re using a mix of Precise/Trusty[1]; we&#x27;re not (presently!) using Rust in a production setting, I&#x27;m only using it to experiment currently, but it&#x27;s still something outside the package manager that _if_ I wanted[5] would apply (and it&#x27;s tempting…), so I decided to mention it. I&#x27;m presently using it to parse an internal file format we have, mostly as a project (one of two) to teach me Rust. (I&#x27;m using Rust presently on Trusty & Gentoo presently, both using the binary downloads from the website. I tried brew-installing it on OS X, but that doesn&#x27;t give me cargo; haven&#x27;t tried again in a few weeks, and haven&#x27;t filed an issue…)<p>While it isn&#x27;t presently in a production setting, I would be completely willing to put it into production. There are some spots where we need more performance than Python can offer, and the memory safety and good static typing are very appealing (I&#x27;m vary wary of memory-unsafe languages anywhere near the path of user input…). (I personally use C++ presently here, but the included gcc in Precise/Trusty IIRC lacks some of the more modern C++11/14 stuff, so heavy use of Boost is needed. Also, some third party libs — mongo, to name one — have less than elegant C++ interfaces…) The Rust standard library has made great strides in the few months since I started using it (I started picking it up in December?), and since my normal work is in Python, the static typing is a very welcome change. I&#x27;m still wrapping my head around lifetimes[2][3], regex! tripped me up a bit[4]. I found some iterator based functions — such as zip — odd: it&#x27;s a member function on the Iterator trait, and only allows two args. I find Python&#x27;s free-standing zip function which takes any number of iterables much more natural. Compare Python:<p><pre><code>  zip(a, b, c, d)\n</code></pre>\nto my understanding of Rust:<p><pre><code>  a.zip(b).zip(c).zip(d)\n</code></pre>\nI also wonder (since I&#x27;ve not tried it) what effect this has on unpacking. Instead of (a_item, b_i, c_i, d_i) being the items of the iterable, I feel you&#x27;d end up with a (a_item, (b_i, (c_i, d_i))); I wonder if a destructuring let would be hard on that? (I&#x27;ve not actually gotten that to work…) Also, I wish enumerate had Python&#x27;s start argument; I use enumerate a lot for doing numbered lists for humans, which start at 1.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s shaping up to be quite a language. I sincerely hope it uproots C.

I&#x27;m trying to get my wife to use Emacs and she has been struggling to make sense of the built in tutorial (as a point of reference, she had practically never used any computing device other than a cell phone before a few years ago).  I&#x27;ll send it to her and see what she thinks.<p>You may ask, &quot;Why the heck are you getting her to use emacs???&quot;.  I started doing consulting this year and initially for tax reasons decided to have my wife run the company (while I did the programming).  It has worked out spectacularly in that my wife loves the job and I can concentrate only on working with the clients.  We have to do double entry accounting, though.  We&#x27;re using ledger-cli which has great Emacs org-mode support, so I&#x27;m hoping to get her going on that.",1428462306

I think people should be allowed to experience plain vanilla Emacs and decide for themselves what they want to change.  If we just tell them &quot;oh, you definitely want these modes enabled and these settings to these values&quot;, I feel they are somehow robbed of the best part of Emacs, namely figuring out what you want your own personal editing experience to be.",1428462266

Your personal data like email is owned by service provider and that data is used for things like ads you don&#x27;t want.<p>Imagine UPS, USPS, FedEx etc reading your mails to send you ads and keeping your mails with them? Sound bizarre, right? It is to us.

Your emails are securely stored with encryption. You can sync data between multiple devices. Also, there is NO storage limits.<p>I would love to get your honest opinion about the idea.

Even if you disagree with this opinion, maybe you can change it, or change the opinion of someone who felt the same way and was just reading through the comments.

2233630,comment,2231621,2231621,0,0,rayiner,,,"The author's argument is specious. You need design guidelines in place for any language feature. You can say the same thing about interfaces in Java - you see a call x.doFoo() and you have <i>no idea</i> what code gets called! Well yes, that's why you formalize your module interfaces and don't let people just randomly create interfaces between modules, etc, etc.<p>Even in assembly you can define a function _do_foo that actually does ""bar.""<p>You need to know how to architect code with meta-programming in mind, no doubt. But this isn't any harder than architecting code with any other language feature in mind. Just as you need to clearly specify the semantics of your interfaces, you need to clearly specify the semantics of DSLs.<p>Managed properly, DSL's can have a tremendous positive impact on the code-base.<p>I've been mucking around in compilers lately, and one thing that never ceases to amaze me is SBCL. The compiler is about 55K LOC + 15K LOC for each native back-end. That's about the same size as the C1 compiler in Hotspot, but does a whole lot more (ie: includes the front-end of the compiler, while C1 gets low-level bytecode as input, has to deal with type inferencing and lambda lifting and all sorts of other things to bring a high-level dynamic language down to machine code, etc, etc). And it does that with algorithms about 15 years older (it doesn't have the benefit of SSA form which would massively simplify many of the optimizations SBCL performs).<p>Macros are a huge part of how SBCL does it. There are 123 macro definitions in the compiler, and they do a tremendous job in cutting code by making DSLs for things like specifying code generators, etc. As for readability - because it's well designed and well-commented, it's surprisingly maintainable and readable for a code-base that's 25 years old and has been maintained by so many different people over the years.",1297989627

No one wants to partners with a guy that can't code and hope he can learn to become a technical cofounder from scratch. Typically speaking, you find someone with coding chops. The same is true of business cofounders BUT unfortunately most idiots don't realize they don't have the business knowledge needed to be a good business cofounder.<p>2. Your cofounder should NOT be waiting around for the product to finish to do his part. There is a SHIT TON of stuff a business cofounder can do while waiting for the prototype to finish. In my honest opinion, if he doesn't know what to do,  he should be hauling ass to figure this out or he's not pulling his weight. I'd argue that in the long haul, while the technical guy mostly codes and do some of the other stuff, the business guy got a lot on his plate. If he sucks now, he'll do even worse as time progresses.<p>3. I hope to god you guys formed a business, have vesting in place, and so that if things don't work out, you're not going to run into more issues than necessary to make this separate clean. And no, just because you guys agree to separate on good terms does not make it clean. There is a process for this.",1297987231

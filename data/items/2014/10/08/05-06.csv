8425497,comment,8421594,8424582,0,0,jholman,,,"&quot;Working programmers&quot; and &quot;published academic type theorists&quot; are examples of meaningful-to-me hopefully-non-partisan classes of speakers.  I can&#x27;t manage to parse what I wrote any other way, I don&#x27;t know what you read.<p>In this context, advocates of a particular programming language, or particular paradigm, are what I had in mind by &quot;partisan&quot;, in that I believe them to be likely to have relatively-agreed-upon definitions of &quot;strong&quot; (within their language community), and I also believe those definitions to be amusingly self-congratulatory.<p>Also, btw, while I think that homeopathy as a &quot;medical discipline&quot; is contemptible, it&#x27;s pretty stupid to say &quot;biologists are correct about the meaning of this word, and homeopaths are not&quot;.  The way that words work is that they mean what people use them to mean.  This, in fact, is my point about the phrases &quot;strong typing&quot; and &quot;weak typing&quot;; in my experience and my literature surveys, these phrases are NOT used consistently, and thus i.m.o. if you wish for your audience to hear the thing you intend to mean, you&#x27;re better off avoiding those phrases.",1412747883

Or rather, I would say it&#x27;s an incomplete way of looking at it. Non-statically typed languages (I&#x27;m thinking reasonably full-featured languages like Perl, Python or Ruby, not Bash) are, IMHO, go-to languages for certain tasks because they allow you to get results quickly. How?<p>* Less typing (there is freedom in being able to cobble together a reasonably complex program in a single file of a few hundred lines in an editor, vs a number of files and thousands of lines in a IDE).<p>* Advanced features! It is only now that closures, first-class functions, etc, start to trickle down to mainstream, statically typed languages. And they do make for shorter programs (see, eg, the post on expired links on HN).<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not to say that non-statically typed programs don&#x27;t suffer from a number of drawbacks, but dismissing conciseness as something trivial does not, I think, accurately reflect reasons for why people use this kind of language.",1412747799

Good art is not testable.<p>Top40 music is palatable to many and is the exact result of what you describe: practice, research, focus, coaching, and peer review on a massive financed scale that &quot;startup&quot; bands could never afford.<p>Yet despite that, the indie music scene has never been more vibrant and alive than it is today. Instead of a small number of bands/groups producing music that all indie fans like, there&#x27;s a huge pool of artists each producing their unique sound based on their own personal values of how music should be produced (including things like practice, focus, peer review, and other things not mentioned like experience, personality, and culture). That, to me, is art -- not a rehearsed manufactured production but an embedded experience unique to the artist you are listening to. That&#x27;s what you heard in popular music until the mid nineties. The lack of quality popular music is not due to lack of craftsmanship.",1412747761

Q apps can be configured out of the box to let people sign up using email, mobile, or facebook. You can also code your own adapter (such as using some other OAuth) and if you do, contribute it to the community.<p>I should mention that the main reason &quot;mobile only&quot; is the default is to try to prevent sybil attacks ... if you&#x27;re a startup looking to launch an app, the last thing you want is to have some jokers create a million accounts and overload your site with inane stuff. Q expects that you&#x27;ll require an authenticated session id for most of the &quot;expensive&quot; stuff like realtime pushes, notifications, or whatever your app wants to implement. But if people can sign up with 1 million fake emails, that won&#x27;t do much good. It&#x27;s hard to make it expensive to create hundreds of accounts and requiring a cellphone number is the only way I know, aside from requiring valid billable credit card numbers. Facebook commect MAY be a close second.<p>Also, people tend to pay more attention to SMSes which improves your retention until they download the native app and switch to in-app notifications.

Definitely something that will make sense for commercial buildings/campuses and multi-unit residential, and single family homes are not too far behind, I think. I can picture homes sometime soon just being wired for AC in the kitchen/garage/utility rooms with a LV DC grid elsewhere.

8425465,comment,8424333,8424333,0,0,beloch,,,"One interesting application for super-bright LED&#x27;s is home theatre projectors. Until very recently such projectors used lamp modules (usually metal-halide) that typically have an operating lifespan of a few thousand hours at most. That&#x27;s a very rough estimate.  Failures can happen sooner and they occasionally implode.  Also, brightness usually drops off gradually as lamps age.  New lamp modules usually cost a few hundred dollars.  These lamps also produce a large ammount of heat and require active cooling, which makes projectors noisy unless carefully designed for quiet operation. For these reasons, home theatre projectors probably remain more of a niche product than they might otherwise be.<p>LED based lamps are starting to show up in this market sector.  Current LED-based projectors are mostly portable projectors that offer low brightness and poor image quality, but some home theatre models of decent quality are starting to appear.  At present, they&#x27;re expensive, less bright than most projectors based on traditional lamps, and still require fans for active cooling.  However, as LED&#x27;s become more power efficient and economical, these projectors will hopefully become brighter, passively cooled, and significantly cheaper.<p>Projectors are not appropriate in many environments, especially those with high ambient light levels, but LED&#x27;s may help them make major inroads into the big-screen market.",1412746854

If your revenue is derived from advertising then users installing ad blocking software is revenue-equivalent to users pirating your software. The fact that it&#x27;s legal for users to do when piracy is not provides no support for argument that ad-supported services are on stronger financial footing.<p>The reason ad-supported services are winning is much simpler. Users prefer them to paying. So if one competitor is &quot;free&quot; (with ads) while another is charging money, the market picks the free one. But ad-supported services don&#x27;t inherently require centralization or feudalism anyway.<p>> The internet is the Wild Wild West.<p>The internet has <i>never</i> been the wild west. Modern computing devices are dramatically more secure than physical things like your house or your car.

And If neither occurs, you won&#x27;t get it at all. I&#x27;ve started to become increasingly convinced that huge scale piracy really did harm the quality of popular music. You can find some good obscure music today, but the average quality seems to have hugely declined in some objective way. Art is no more free than code, and good art really does cost more than bad art for all kinds of reasons... Fewer can make it, and quality takes time and sustained focus. Having some talentless tart squall into an auto tuner to a cliched catchy melody is cheap. Finding an Elizabeth Fraser and paying them to practice for 40 hours a week under the supervision of a professional choral voice instructor while you coach the band on composition in a recording studio is not. Why invest in a product nobody will pay for?<p>Funny how when I bring up the issue in the context of software everyone agrees. Of course people have to get paid somehow and of course polished products cost money. But on every forum including this one, nobody gets how there could be any relationship whatsoever between the quality of art and its ability to be financed. I think this comes down to one of the greatest myths about art: that it comes from some automatic and magical place and people either have it or they don&#x27;t, and that artists make art solely out of duty to the muse. Like anything else art is a skill and doing it well requires practice, research, focus, coaching, even peer review, and all of that takes time during which many people including the artist must be supported. There is a component of inspiration but raw inspiration without the rest of it results in rough draft quality work that is only of value to the artist themselves.<p>Piracy undermines the ability to finance art just like it does in software. What&#x27;s one of the first questions a VC asks about? Defensibility. In other words how will you protect your ability to monetize the value you create.

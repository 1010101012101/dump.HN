( <a href=""http://www.vetta.org/documents/ui_benelearn.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vetta.org/documents/ui_benelearn.pdf</a> ) Marcus Hutter's PhD thesis produced a theory of ""Universal Artificial Intelligence"" called ""AIXI"" based on Solomonoff induction. Sadly, AIXI is incomputable, and the time and space bounded version ""AIXItl"" is still impractical. <a href=""http://www.hutter1.net/ai/aixigentle.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hutter1.net/ai/aixigentle.htm</a><p>But you're right: we don't know much about intelligence nor how it should be embodied on a computer. This is why we should encourage some really smart people to focus on the problem! I sincerely think this is an area that would yield to research. Might take a long time and a lot of brainpower though...<p>Lenat's Eurisko is pretty cool, and I don't know much about it, but it doesn't sound like Eurisko is as general as is needed. ",1180972730

I could have used GoDaddy and done it a lot cheaper, but I was too stupid and lazy.</i><p>I don't understand this part (either). First of all, 55 domains is way overkill. Maybe some of the country-coded TLDs are worth it if you're really going to do, say, a German-language Truemors.<p>Ok, so even then, 55 x $6.95 =~ $385. (GoDaddy does $6.95 domains with discount codes. There are scores of discount codes out there. Use CHILL3, for instance.) I can understand being a little lazy, but $700 lazy? Even if you're rich, 700 bucks is 700 bucks.<p>If it was me: F the country codes. Register .com, .org, .net, .us, .info, .biz. And you're done -- in fact, you're beyond done. You don't really need that crap at all. You need some SEO instead, perhaps.",1180972412

I could have used my uncle the divorce lawyer and saved a few bucks, but that would have been short sighted if Truemors ever becomes worth something.</i><p>Why?? I have yet to completely understand this. PG, in one of his essays, also says that you should go and pay an expensive lawyer rather than use an incoporating service. Why?<p>Is there something The Company Corporation is doing wrong that a high-price lawyer would do right? Maybe I don't understand something, but all you're doing is filing some standard legal documents, right?<p>What is there to do so wrong? $4,824.14? Really?<p>IANAL obviously. I wish lawyers hung out here. Does anyone have any insight?",1180972123

That would happen as a matter of course if you got a deal.<p>The main reason to incorporate or LLC is to protect yourself from legal liability. If someone sues you, you want to protect your personal assets from being part of that lawsuit. If you're not even going to be live, then you may not have anything to worry about.",1180970933

Clearly, I can not afford extra expenditures.<p>My friends will see a private beta, and then I'd like to start looking for some funding.  Will I need to be incorporated before that point?",1180970053

26266,comment,26116,26221,0,0,machine,,,"I think the problem is still that there isn't really a clear definition of general intelligence or how it should be embodied on a computer.  I agree that putting a bunch of different algorithms for different tasks in a box won't create something people would be willing to call general intelligence, but what do you expect a general purpose intelligence algorithm to do exactly?  That is, if I handed you one, how would you test it?  What are the inputs and outputs?<p>Don't get me wrong, I'd love to create a general artificial intelligence.  It's just not clear to me what that means.  In the absence of a good definition of the general problem, I think it's perfectly reasonable to pick an extremely hard specific problem (like visual object recognition), and focus on that, under the assumption that in order to completely solve this specific problem you will end up solving the (undefined) general problem.<p>""A ""true AI"" would discover regularities [2], or patterns, in any search space, and exploit these patterns to incrementally improve its ability to navigate the search space."" -- Actually this sounds like Eurisko, a heuristic search program that modifies it's own heuristics <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurisko"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurisko</a><p>Also, it's worth pointing out that the different techniques used in different subfields of AI are not always that different.  There has been some work in creating very general powerful frameworks that explain a lot of specific algorithms, like Markov logic networks <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_logic_network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_logic_network</a> which are sufficiently powerful that they subsume all of logic and statistical graphical models (which is to say maybe 90% of all recent machine learning algorithms).  With these sorts of general frameworks new algorithms and approaches in one subfield get ported over to other subfields, and there is more interaction then you might think.",1180969276

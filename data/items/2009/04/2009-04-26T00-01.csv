[where resources is any one of: stack, heap, file descriptors, etc.]<p>Which is non-ideal, in isolation, certainly. But Guido's whole post was about saying there are trade-offs, and he doesn't like the trade-off made in the other direction. (Misleading stack traces, etc.) Guido does seem to understand both sides of the argument. But ultimately it is a design decision. And he made it.",1240707494

I bet you wouldn't have said it, if I hadn't said bastard.  That's not anything more than an observation about humans in general, it's not meant as anything more.<p>In regards to your protest at the level of my response.  My response is appropriate, but it is, indeed, non-typical.  I purposely chose to take off the gloves here, rather than water down my speech because the watered down speech that is so typically used in these kinds of discussions has confused you and many others.<p>Just like abstraction in software, much of our society abstracts away the really important bits.  Just like in software, this can be abused.<p>Anytime you calmly and rationally talk about adding taxes to do this program or that program, you need to remember that there are men with guns that will deprive people of their lives or their liberty unless they comply.  Too often, you forget that because it's abstracted away by the system we have.  I feel that such a profound imposition of your will over mine is indeed cause for less watered down speech than usually used.  If that made you uncomfortable, than I'm happy about that.  That was it's intent.<p>When you then go on to say that you want to use that awesome power regardless of whether or not the original catalyst is a valid one, because ""it's a good idea"", I have to do what I can to get through to you how dangerous that sort of thinking is.",1240705782

You call it just 'social'. It is a minor disagreement.<p>I agree: For most of history battles were not based on technological advantage against superior numbers, but were simple wars of attrition between increasingly equal opponents in numbers and technology. (That mindset culminated in WWI.) Warrior aristocracies did control territories out of proportion of their numbers. <i>Especially in times of peace</i>, when subjugating their own populations.<p>Being more steadfast can't defeat 10-1 odds (that requires significant technological advantage), but it was still worth a lot.<p>---<p>I wasn't sure how to talk about cohesiveness. Cohesive can be just stubborn persistence, or it can be more harmonious tactics.<p>Technology always has a social component. For the macedonian pike to arise you needed the social infrastructure around it that allowed Philip to train soldiers, then send them out to become battle-hardened defending trading routes from pirates. (That's a pretty common pattern, and explains why islands often grow into great powers; the right social infrastructure for warlike technology often arises after trade for several generations.)<p>But by no means is it so simple a matter as just being more steadfast. I can't think of a single battle that was won against 10-1 odds in numbers without technological advantage (including dramatically superior generalship and training). In fact, it's battles like in WWI or involving General Marlborough that relied on steadfastness and attrition because there was no other advantage, of technology or of generalship or of numbers.",1198777995

Was just saying Realtor has much more financial incentive to screw me over in a legal, but still unkind, way.""<p>\nI'd rather have an equal playing field and do my own worrying about the realtor screwing me over than about my physical safety. The economy works great with people looking after their own financial interests, but not so well when things like contracts, personal safety, banking, or insurance bonds are non-existent.<p>\nStill like that idea of a bazaar being better than dealing with a professional in a western culture? From where I'm sitting it's not looking so hot. Remember -- the guy in the bazaar can still screw you the ways professionals in the west can -- but he can screw you in a lot more ways, too.",1198777390

Was just saying Realtor has much more financial incentive to screw me over in a legal, but still unkind, way.<p><i>""I'd like to point out that houses sell and are bought for all kinds of reasons aside from price. So I believe your reply to be a little weak in that regard. ... In fact, the idea is that the risk is reduced to simply: is it worth what I am paying for it?""</i><p>I totally agree that houses are bought for a number of reasons, but I was discussing the dimension involving getting the best price. If you love a house because it has fluffy pink toilet seats and are willing to pay any amount of money for that comfort, then you aren't getting screwed. On the other hand, if you live in the real world and have a maximum budget for a house, the realtor will always show you things just above your range, in the hopes you will splurge on it. Sure, you can find another realtor that won't do this, but most people won't. It's not illegal, and only slightly immoral, so I can't say I blame the realtor. They are just working within the system they are given to maximize personal gain, like anyone else. The problem I was pointing out is that the system is not well aligned with the needs of either the buyer or seller.<p><i>""Some of these cultures, for instance, refuse to use a banking system, believing it to be immoral. While I deeply respect the right of any individual to believe any dang thing he wants, cultures that do things like ban banking, private property rights, etc. greatly increase the risk during financial transactions. That's why I'd never get involved in Russia, for instance -- never can tell when the ruling party might decide just to take over your entire business. You can't have a highly-functioning society like that.""</i><p>I totally agree there.",1198776676

We're just using slightly different definitions of the word ""micromanage"".<p>Here's what I'd say: <p>A system which keeps track of all the gifts that you've given friends/coworkers? Great! That system is helping you to manage the gifts, but you are still in control.<p>A system in which the gifts get chosen and sent automatically? Not so great. What's the algorithm? If it's ""give everyone fruitcake"", why do I need a computer to figure that out? If it's ""spy on their gmail accounts to figure out what they like""... well, that's pure evil. Your co-workers will be completely creeped out by your eerily specific gifts... Christmas will feel like the Twilight Zone. And I'm not convinced there's much middle ground between these two models. After all, if <i>you</i> find it hard to be thoughtful, how on earth do you expect the Googlebot to find it easy? The Googlebot may cost more than you, but it is not remotely as thoughtful.<p>\nMeanwhile, I too long for the day when my iPhone will remember the names of everyone I meet. I just don't think that it should be put in charge of answering my mail, or writing my dialogue. And I seriously doubt that it will be any good at telling the difference between my first meeting with the new mailman, my first meeting with an annoying traveling salesman, my first meeting with my future wife, and my first meeting with Linus Torvalds. That will still be my job.",1198775076

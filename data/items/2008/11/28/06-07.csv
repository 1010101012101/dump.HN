My wife and I had a 2BR, an entire floor of a house with off-street parking, in East Arlington for $1400 a month. A mile walk from the Red Line, on a major bus route. For a cute second-floor walkup 1BR in Davis Square, Somerville -- literally thirty seconds from the Red Line if you run -- I paid $1150.",1227855470

379159,comment,379111,379111,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I've lived in Boston, then moved to SV, then moved back to Boston, where I live now (modulo a few miles).<p>IMHO, you're right on all counts about the pros and cons. I don't have recent data, but my impression is that Boston rents are not significantly cheaper (as they would be in, say, Alabama); savings will come from transportation costs. You can live without a car in Boston. Living without a car in Silicon Valley will make you feel like a second-class citizen. Obviously, Boston is closer to your folks if you're from NY.<p>If I were going to do a startup, and was able to honestly utter the phrase ""I lived in SV for a while and loved it""... it's <i>very</i> hard to argue with Silicon Valley. Yeah, it's a monoculture, but it's a monoculture designed around what you're trying to do. Aspiring screenwriters move to L.A.; aspiring musicians move to Nashville; aspiring software wizards move to Silicon Valley.<p>But the most important thing is: you can change your mind. More than once. Pick the job that seems the best and don't sweat it. Sample Boston for a year or two if you want and make the move to SV later.",1227854982

379156,comment,379111,379111,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Is Boston significantly cheaper than SV (I'd probably be in the Mountain View area)? It's hard to find comparable areas for cost of apartments and such.""<p>Mountain View is very nearly the same price as San Francisco.  Because of Google it is among the most expensive places in the valley.  I've lived here since we did YC last year, and I've enjoyed it.  It's a lovely, quiet, and highly technology focused area, with good restaurants (as long as you like Asian and Mediterranean food), cool little groceries and produce markets (mostly Asian and Mediterranean, but also the Milk Pail which is close to heaven for fans of fresh food), a fantastic library, and even a decent cultural scene (though it is very much white bread small town culture...the performing arts center is excellent for such a tiny town; the massive tax base of the city insures most city services are excellent).<p>I don't know anything about Boston, but I've heard it's also quite expensive.<p>I'm paying $2145/mo for a two bedroom rental house a few blocks from downtown Mountain View (with a garage).  It's pretty big compared to where most of the folks I know out here are living, but I moved from an even bigger place in Austin, so it was definitely downsizing for me.  I've been shopping for a place in SF, and have found that prices are pretty similar for smaller places--$1600-$2000 for a one bedroom (sometimes plus small office) apartment in a decent location.<p>Salaries in California are enough to make up for most of the higher cost of living, as long as you don't have a strong desire to own your own home anytime soon.<p>""- Any advice on which of two hypothetical is better: big fish little pond or little fish big pond? Alternatively, would you rather be at an important team in a lesser-known company, or a less-important team in a well-known company?""<p>How long is a piece of string?

379155,comment,378658,379099,0,0,trominos,,,"> If you can't calculate the value of it, then it has no defined value.<p>That's not true. The Busy Beaver function is a counterexample: it's possible to enumerate all n-rule Turing machines. Each such machine either halts after a finite number of steps or does not. We can list the number of steps that all the halting n-rule machines take to stop, and the largest number that we list is BB(n). That's defined.<p>I think your problem is that you don't understand what ""computable"" means. When we say that the Busy Beaver function is uncomputable, we mean that there is no halting algorithm that takes <i>any natural number n</i> as its input and <i>always</i> returns BB(n). There are algorithms that return BB(n) for any specific n: ""return [BB(n)]"" is an example.<p>The reason that no general (finite) algorithm exists that can compute the Busy Beaver function is this: there are some Turing machines that never halt but that <i>cannot be proven to never halt</i>; that is, there is no sequence of symbols and accompanying interpretive framework that proves that such a machine never halts. BUT THEY STILL DON'T HALT. So when our algorithm tries to compute BB(k), and there's a k-rule TM in the class that I described, the algorithm freaks out. It has no way of knowing that it should ignore this TM, because it's mathematically impossible to know that. But it can't wait forever either. So it watches the weird TM for an infinite amount of time. The only way to get around this is to hard-code in special case handling for these weird TMs; but you can only do that a finite number of times ('cause the algorithm's finite), and the class of weird TMs has no finite description.<p>To the person whose comment is above or below mine: that's the difference between BB(1 - 4) and BB(100). There are no weird TMs with less than 5 rules. But there are almost certainly some with 100 rules.",1227854253

People say ""I'm going live there/date her because it's only 45 minutes away"". You think about 45 minutes, and it's not that much.<p>And then it's cool for a short period of time, but pretty soon days fade into weeks and every time you dread it, especially when you realize its 45 minutes each way. Suddenly you're spending 10% of your waking time (which is like 40% of your free time) commuting and before you know it you're looking on Monster.com/eHarmony again.<p>Just a cycle I've observed many times that seems to occur with 100% frequency, though oddly I've never had either a job or girlfriend who was over 15 minutes away.",1227854198

379151,comment,379111,379111,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I kinda hated Cambridge. It was dirty and expensive, and the weather was brutal in the summer and I hear even worse in winter. Weather has a much bigger effect on our moods than most of us realize, and SV ranks up there with San Diego and Hawaii on that score.<p>Food was decent though, especially for a college town. I liked Boston proper much better, but I didn't live there, and as with most cities I'm guessing your enjoyment will depend a lot on exactly which parts you live and work in.In fairness, I may have liked Cambridge better if I lived in Harvard square. I may have gotten sick of it really fast too, idk.<p>SV is also expensive, though it's probably not much more nowadays. The exception being that you may well need a car there (which is a hell of a lot less painful than having a car in SF or Boston, since parking is free and ample, but still an expense to factor in) whereas Boston has really good public transportation and you can likely do without if you don't mind walking a bit. Your best bet is to just check around on Apartments.com and Craigslist and compare rent for similarly sized units in similar areas if you're concerned about price.<p>If you're looking for investment for a software startup, or networking that might lead to that in the future, go directly to Silicon Valley. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. Our startup was either the first or second YC company to get a single Boston investor as of this past August. The ratio of SV investors to Boston in YC startups has to be at least 20:1. I hear Boston is pretty awesome for biomed though. I imagine you can find great cofounders in either location, though in Boston you'd have to snag them before they left for SV.<p>As for your hypothetical, I'd take big fish little pond any day. The pond can grow much faster and larger than the fish. And even if it doesn't, it will almost certainly be more fun and rewarding. Assuming you're normal college grad age, you've got your whole life to be another cog in the wheel. Give yourself a shot of avoiding it permanently.",1227853657

379149,comment,379111,379142,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Nothing good in Mountain View is more than a mile from Caltrain, though almost all of SF is far away from the Caltrain station.  I exaggerate slightly, but pretty much all of Mountain View is within a few blocks of the two stations.<p>Both Palo Alto and Mountain View are extremely friendly to commuters.  SF is, too, but it's quite a long way away. That's not to say I don't know a lot of people that make the SF to MV or PA commute.  A huge percentage of Google and Facebook employees live in the city.  Though Googlers have a shuttle service, with WiFi, so they don't generally take Caltrain.<p>But, I agree.  Commuting sucks the life out of you...even with a train, spending two hours each day in transit just wouldn't be worth it, to me.",1227853080

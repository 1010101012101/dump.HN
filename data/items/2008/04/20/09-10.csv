Some time ago I decide to better organize my gaming schedule so I thought that first thing in the morning should be 2h of gaming. After two weeks I started procrastinating on my gaming duties until I was completely disgusted by and abandoned the game :)<p>Interesting how when something becomes to much of an obligation it lose it's recreational value.",1208685091

I thoroughly enjoyed pretty much all of them.<p>Overall it was an excellent event. Except that one annoying guy who kept asking the speakers ""questions"" that ended up being rather ridiculous advice.",1208684862

I suggest you contact some of the people involved in setting up BarCamp Milwaukee 1 & 3, Web414, and maybe Silicon Pastures. (Google them). There is not a lot of support for entrepreneurs in Wisconsin. The city and state will tell you there is, but that's a lot of talk. The best options for support (emotional, ideas, financial, etc.) come from grass roots sources, at least here.",1208684488

168410,comment,168400,168400,0,0,jrockway,,,"FWIW, I think Seaside with Magritte is The Way (tm) to do web apps.  But you're not going to find many libraries with Smalltalk.  My recommendation is to just port those to another language, then use that :)<p>I'm currently working on a port of Magritte to Perl called Ernst, and a new web framework called Kiiteh.  Both are very in-progress right now, so I don't recommend even imagining that they exist.  In a few months, though, that will be the One True Way.  Decent language, phenomenal library support, and a nice way of easily writing web apps. :)",1208682753

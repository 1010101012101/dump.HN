This is similar to my own CS university experience, but I&#x27;d like to see it broken out into much better defined areas, with different ratios of focus for different career tracks.  I also think a full program should take significantly longer than a 4-year degree.<p>Incidentally, I think #1 could easily be taught without #3 at all.  I get the impression that there are quite a few academic people who tinker with interesting algorithmic work, in esoteric languages, who couldn&#x27;t effectively write maintainable code for mass deployment.  Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that, it&#x27;s just a different area of specialization.",1392011744

Responsibilities are an issue, (and this is especially an issue for women, who, if they want to have a family can&#x27;t wait as long as men can), but it isn&#x27;t the only one.<p>One thing that I think is pretty clear is that as we age, our thought processes change.   This is something we don&#x27;t like to talk bout because because it brings up spectres like age discrimination, but it is true.<p>The thing is, this isn&#x27;t a neutral tradeoff.   While purely abstract manipulation of data may be easier in one&#x27;s twenties, solving real-world problems is much easier at the age of 40, not only because we understand the problems we are solving better but also because we understand problem solving better, and tend to be better at it.<p>Can someone with a liberal arts degree pick up coding on her spare time and make real, significant contributions to the world by so doing?  Absolutely.  Will she be interchangeable with someone who has been coding since age of 6? Probably not.

Perhaps learning linear algebra would be time better spent[1]. Sill, calculus is the first <i>applied math</i> course and is very useful for many areas of science so I&#x27;m not altogether in agreement that learning calculus is bad for you. On the contrary---in combination with a mechanics class it can be very good in terms of learning how to model the real world.<p>That being said, I think UGRADs spend waaaaaay too much time learning calculus: Calc I, Calc II, multivariable, vector calculus, etc. That&#x27;s like 4 semesters of calculus! This signals to the student that calculus is somehow a big deal, when in fact it is not: it&#x27;s just <i>calc</i>ulation techniques. I think this should be cut-down to 2 semesters: Calc I+II together, then multivariable+vector calc.

7209367,comment,7207851,7209034,4,0,malisper,,,"I&#x27;m not entirely sure, but I have been able to figure a few things out.<p>By running some simulations by shuffling the range from 1 to n (with n going from 3 to 7), I found that at least one of the most common permutations had always started with 2. I&#x27;m unable to come up with a reason to explain this, but I was able to figure out something else interesting.<p>Imagining that the deck is vertical and going through each card and swapping it with a random card in the deck, the random card that has been swapped will never move further up the deck while the other card can still possibly move further up the deck. This implies that cards at the top of the deck should stay near the top and the cards at the bottom should stay near the bottom. I tested this by taking the sum of the sums of the first half of all the permutations and the sum of the sums of the second half of all the permutations and found that the total sum of the first halves was slightly smaller than the total sum of the second halves.<p><pre><code>  n first halves | second halves\n  3           53 |            54\n  4         1265 |          1295\n  5        18322 |         18976\n  6       461683 |        498093\n  7      9638931        10051128\n</code></pre>\nSo it seems that cards starting near the top are more likely to end up near the top and cards starting near the bottom are more likely to end up near the bottom.<p><i>Note: for odd numbers I threw out the middle number.</i>",1392011264

The Spliterator in Java doesn&#x27;t sound as easy to use and seems more aimed at low-level library code instead of user code.

7209326,comment,7205759,7209003,1,0,dpe82,,,"It&#x27;s more complex than that. Let me explain:<p>Audio is typically passed into a soundcard&#x27;s digital audio converter (DAC) as  integers representing samples of the audio waveform. For example, a full volume sine wave looks something like this[0]. That signal is perfectly safe to play on any hardware. However, if you take that same sine wave and increase the amplitude you end up with values outside the valid range so you have to cap them. You get something that looks like this[1].<p>Lopping off the tops and bottoms of the waveform is clipping, and the newly created sharp edges in the waveform are what can damage your speaker. They require a ton of energy to play (producing heat) and in some cases can trigger the buildup of high frequency harmonic oscillations in your speaker&#x27;s voice coil that can eventually crack it. More expensive speakers last longer but virtually all speakers eventually &quot;blow&quot; under such circumstances.<p>The trouble is playing waveforms like that once in a while is totally ok and short bursts of very similar waveforms exist benignly in lots of stuff you listen to every day. And while it&#x27;s trivial to know if you&#x27;re creating clipped audio,  it&#x27;s very difficult (read: processor intensive) and error-prone to detect it after the fact. When you do detect it, your solutions are to either drastically lower the global volume so the edges have a lot less energy, or distort the waveform to make those edges more smooth. It&#x27;s really, really hard to avoid false positives though and not end up &quot;enforcing&quot; against audio data that&#x27;s natural and perfectly ok in moderation.<p>[0] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Pcm.svg/500px-Pcm.svg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Pcm...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/audio/clipping/fig1.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/audio/clippi...</a>",1392010380

The TTC is a thousand times better than either BART or MUNI.<p>You can actually sit on your seats (see: BART). There aren&#x27;t giant shit-stains on the carpet (who the fuck puts carpet in a public transit vehicle?!). The trains run on time for the most part (see: MUNI). The stations don&#x27;t literally smell like shit and piss (see: BART). Oh, and it takes 23 mins to travel 7 mi, instead of 55min (York Mills - Union station, compare with Ocean Beach - Embarcadero).<p>The BART and MUNI are horrific transit agencies.

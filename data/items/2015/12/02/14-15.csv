Another one is Relay/GraphQL.<p>Redux adheres to the basic unidirectional data flow philosophy of Flux. Where it mainly differs is that there is one store. All state is kept in a (potentially large) graph of JS objects and arrays. It is also very functional in nature.<p>One advantage is that it solves the Flux store singleton problem. This makes it more amenable to building isomorphic apps, among other things.<p>I&#x27;ve been using it and find that it&#x27;s more straightforward than typical Flux implementations. There&#x27;s less boilerplate. It also allows for more heterogeneous data storage and more flexible structure.

10663218,comment,10650852,10662730,0,0,titzer,,,"Having lived for a few years in Europe now, I can tell you that thoughtful city planning is totally possible at critical densities, and highly worth it. The quality of life for citizens is highly improved by having first of all, walkable cities. Every bus station, 4-lane road, and parking lot within a city makes it less walkable. Since many European cities were already quite large well before automobiles, they inherit their walkability through their centuries of necessity. It is going to be hard to push many US cities towards that density threshold with just buses and taxis. I&#x27;ll respond to some of your points.<p><quote>Subways and light rail are high cost, high visibility, negative return investments for most municipalities.</quote><p>That&#x27;s absolutely fine. The government and public infrastructure is not really meant to turn a profit. They are funded through tax dollars since they have positive externalities for all citizens. It&#x27;s just usually the case that pay-per-use is just too expensive to bootstrap effectively. We need to rid ourselves of this mental model. The government needs to spend money to make the public system work, hands down. And that means taxes. And even if you don&#x27;t use the subway, you benefit that other people do (because they don&#x27;t have their huge cars taking up your road space and parking space!)<p><quote>\nSubways are very expensive to build, very expensive to move, and a deficit on their community if the areas in which they&#x27;re built don&#x27;t have very high population densities.\n</quote><p>So what. It works in NYC and in pretty much every major European city. These are old, well-established cities where digging is fraught with peril. As I mentioned before, the problem is that US cities usually aren&#x27;t dense enough.<p><quote>\nIf they&#x27;re instead given dedicated space, they become much more expensive as extra road lanes must often be built (or easements otherwise negotiated and purchased by municipalities), and they end up much harder to move for want of further easement & road expansion.\n</quote><p>Well, considering that public transport is generally more space efficient than autos, replacing a lane with a tram or light rail track should actually increase capacity. Why do we keep thinking that it has to be additive (i.e. in addition to existing roads)? No wonder people balk.<p><quote>\nBuses require no tracks, no tunnels, no $5 million train cars, and a route can be switched in a day by putting up a couple new bus stop posts. Bus systems can actually be profitable if local governments don&#x27;t try to make political wins by drawing expensive bus routes in distant, low-volume rural areas. Buses suffer from traffic like most light rail does.\n</quote><p>That&#x27;s great, let&#x27;s have more buses! (Although I disagree that routes into rural areas are for political points.) But buses won&#x27;t be enough. Subways are unbelievably efficient once they are in place (you can fit literally 500 people in one train!), and again, they require critical density. We need to get there, and buses are step along the way.<p>Also, BIKES and BIKE lanes. Nothing really beats walking or riding a bike to work on a nice day. Hands down! Try Copenhagen.",1449067833

Think about an insurance company&#x27;s portfolio. It will need assets to balance against liabilities which include human life insurance policies. Some business insurance policies can be for even longer time frames, think nuclear power plants. To balanced against those liabilities part of what you need is an investment with a similar time horizon. Now, the gold or whatever ore these companies mine may not have that horizon, but their company stock and some of their company debt certainly will. And since both their stock and debt valuations will be tied to the ore they mine and return, some of that correlation will find its way back to the price of gold, platinum, etc. But the price of gold will be impacted even more directly than that. A large percentage of precious metals are held for their store of value rather than their value in industrial uses. If, as an investor, I know that over then next 30 years the price of my investment will drop 20% or more, I plug those numbers into the NPV equation, and I get the hell out of that position untill the price comes down and is in line with what I&#x27;d pay for the metal almost at the cost of an industrial commodity. That&#x27;s of course a simplified version of how it&#x27;d all play out, but the broad strokes are there.<p>How long would you hold onto your home mortgage if you <i>knew</i> that at some point, you&#x27;re not exactly sure when, but at some point you&#x27;re home&#x27;s value will plummet?",1449067199

How range finding works with optical sites is you usually have a series of marks in the viewfinder that you use to physically measure what you&#x27;re aiming at, so if the tank/plane/whatever is between particular two pips (or whatever; edit iirc the M1 had two curved lines you would placer over the target) you know that it&#x27;s about x meters away. The pips are calculated knowing the average length of the object, so this is, in practice, close enough.<p>The procedure is; measure the target, then use cross marks on the cross hairs to raise the gun tube to the appropriate level, manually guess lead and defilade, fire, on the way. It obviously takes practice to get good at.  I found it curious that the US Army continued to teach/train/use this method, as well as land navigation with compass/mapp instead of gps. The idea is to not rely on technology entirely.<p>Edit: turns out I am describing stadiametric rangefinding:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadiametric_rangefinding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadiametric_rangefinding</a>",1449067008

A well designed BFF would abstract away this problem by providing a set of individually optimized endpoints, presumably crafted in a way that reflects the underlying persistence layer (like any good REST API) as well as gathering data together for a particular client&#x27;s needs, so that the front-end designer can decide which calls to make, and whether requesting [field2] is worth the cost.<p>The alternative in a GraphQL world would be to have a set of best-practices which annotate the data model.

10663073,comment,10651857,10661366,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"It is your right to believe what you asserted. My experience points me in a different direction; my comments are not directed as criticism, just offering a different perspective. See my comment below that I&#x27;m well aware there are personalities for whom the perspective I offer are not suited for.<p>> Prices act as a mechanism to incorporate information on efficiency of resource use and cheap disposable items are cheap in part because they take fewer resources to manufacture and transport.<p>I consider the concept of pricing-conveying-information outdated in a world that moves much faster and is far more sophisticated and complicated than earlier ages. The modern drawback with relying upon pricing to convey information is there is a huge latency between pricing and customer-relevant information coming out about the product or service. This latency only gets larger as software-aided and -enhanced customers start grappling with an ever-larger constellation of externalities of the products and services they incorporate into their decisions, as do sellers.<p>I don&#x27;t want to find out the BuyItForLife tool I purchased for a premium price is not the same quality as a past generation of buyers bought and recommended, but only after half a decade of market pressure forces the manufacturer to lower prices as the news of their shoddier modern instances start to gradually filter through the public. I want to know before I buy it, and it is the Internet, not pricing, that is gradually forcing out that information asymmetry that exists between sellers and consumers in category after category. It is not pricing chiefly disambiguating the dozens of choices facing Amazon buyers, it is the recommendation data.<p>Furthermore, repairability and durability in tandem are often consonant with modifiability. The Internet enables hundreds of thousands to millions of people to access and share with each other skills to modify all sorts of products, far faster than before. The barriers to entry to learn product hacking skills like soldering, welding, plastics molding, woodworking, etc., are far lower than someone born just 20 years ago can imagine, and we aren&#x27;t nearly finished yet with that trend. Product modifiability is essential to not just keeping products out of the landfill, but also future-proofing and adaptability to a user&#x27;s specific requirements. I hold that such adaptability is essential to confront the ever-complex future we all face.<p>There is most assuredly a spectrum of trade-offs. In a resource-constrained setting (perhaps below about a middle-class First World standard of living, maybe lower?), I most heartily agree with you that over-engineering every product choice is premature optimization. But the &quot;particular use case&quot; mindset, even when the use case is say 20 years, is a subtle trap. That mindset is a much-scaled-up timescale version of the &quot;why the poor stay poor&quot; time-capital preference decisions. The farther out you can push that timescale, the more you (and your progeny) have an opportunity to escape that trap.<p>Note I&#x27;m not saying buy over-engineered for every single product, even if you can afford that purchase behavior. For specific categories of products however, like objects that are intimately tied to physical human factors, it&#x27;s a good bet to buy over-engineered where you can afford it and/or it has a positive impact on your productivity. For example, there is unlikely to be a quantum leap in wood planer technology akin to the transition from hand-held to power planers in the near&#x27;ish (20-100 years) future; a hand-held power planer you buy today can conceivably be handed down to a few future generations and still deliver the same functionality. Products that can enjoy a quantum leap in functionality from embedded software could be a big exception in the coming decades, though; change from a hand-held to a bench planer, and software could be a significant consideration in the future, for example.<p>I don&#x27;t advocate this purchase behavior for everyone. It works best if you have the personality who considers in advance the logistical tail of properly maintaining a purchased product, including proper stowage (often means climate-controlled or at least humidity-controlled), preventative maintenance, ancillary repair tools, and spare parts stocking (a lamentable side-effect of a minority purchase behavior is spare parts are not as readily obtainable in more remote locations, so stocking the most commonly wear and tear parts mitigates downtime). My rough rule of thumb is 1.5-2.0X purchase price for that logistical tail for the time that I own it before passing it onwards. If you don&#x27;t plan on having children or a similarly close relationship with relatives from a younger generation (nephews/nieces for example), or mentees, then this purchase behavior applies less to you. And so on. Different strokes for different folks, there are no hard and fast rules here, just considerations to weigh.<p>Finally, we all face the minimal quantums of time and energy in our lives. These products represent embedded time and energy not just to create them, but the buyer&#x27;s time and energy, to evaluate, understand operation, adopt to idiosyncrasies, etc. Product switching costs these days are increasingly incorporating greater complexities. For an ever-increasing swath of products as software permeates across the physical landscape, it is no longer just a consideration of keeping embedded time and energy from a landfill.",1449066447

Not many pilots are willing to sit directly in the path of machine gun fire, even if it is not very accurate. German anti-aircraft figured this out as well. They switched to shooting mostly tracer rounds. You aren&#x27;t going to hit anything in the first place, so you might as well just scare the crap out of them.<p>There were some WWII &#x27;gunship&#x27; style modifications of planes, but that was not that common.<p>For a more modern comparison, consider that the Bradley fighting vehicle carries anti tank missiles. Sending a group of Bradleys directly against tanks would be suicidal. The Bradley has aluminum for armor. A well trained set of tank crews operating even WWII vintage vehicles would decimate them. Instead, the misiles are there to deter tanks from engaging them. It also provides the crew with an enormous psychological benefit. That benefit is they at least have the benefit of being able to respond to an enemy tank with a potentially lethal weapons system. Ironically of course the TOW missiles on the Bradley destroyed more Iraqi tanks the M1 tank ever did in the Gulf war. But that is because Iraqi tank crews either had no experience or had armored vehicles in horrible condition.",1449065816

The article does have the caveat &quot;while &#x27;100&#x27; is an easy-to-remember round number, it&#x27;s just an approximation&quot;, but the realities of that caveat make the title very misleading.<p>The number of hours required for basic competence is HIGHLY dependent on three key things:<p>1. The particular activity<p>2. The abilities of the person<p>3. How much competence you consider &quot;basic&quot;<p>I submit that these three factors have so much variance that it makes any kind of N-hour rule mostly useless.  I know people who can pick up a new programming language very quickly, but would take a long time to achieve basic competence in a new physical activity.  Conversely, I know people who can pick up new sports very quickly, but it would take them FAR longer than 100 hours to learn to program with decent competency.  (Hell, I think it takes far longer than 100 hours for even a naturally talented non-programmer to learn to program.)<p>Some activities have straight-up MUCH steeper learning curves than other activities.  For example, it takes longer to get good at olympic lifting than it does to get good at running.  You might even disagree with that particular example, but if you do, that speaks to the third point of varying definitions of &quot;basic&quot;.<p>The bottom line is that there is no substitute for hours of focused effort.  Yes, you want to be aware of techniques that can make your effort achieve better results, but you still have to put in the hours.  How many hours?  I can&#x27;t possibly say without knowing a lot more about you, the activity, and what level of competence you&#x27;re shooting for.",1449065782

See the bomber guns had an effective range of 1000 yards or whatever so if you stood off 1200 yards in your ME-109 and launched rockets that blew up in 1200 yards that worked pretty well.<p>I&#x27;ve read a couple memoirs of WWII pilots, interesting stuff.  I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re all dead now, whats documented out there is all we&#x27;ll ever have.<p>As for effectiveness, well, bomber aircraft losses were tremendous until the end of the war, yet they lost the war anyway.  So its hard to say.  If you can down 10% of the B-17 per bombing run against ball bearing factories, but still lose the war, was it effective or not?  Or looking at the staggering economic and logistics costs of the air war, skipping the air war and focusing on shipping over tanks that don&#x27;t suck might have ended the war in &#x27;44 or earlier, so maybe it was ineffective.  Imagine if the winter battle of the bulge never happened because the war was already over by winter rather than lasting till spring.  Or maybe no bombing would have meant more hardware would have meant the D-day invasion getting pushed back into the sea Dunkirk II style.

One can nitpick some of the math and assumptions, but the message is directionally correct.<p>The problem too many of these so called unicorns have is that there&#x27;s not much in the way of real fundamentals supporting their lofty valuations. The valuation is largely based on hype. A lot of these companies valued at $1billion + may realistically only have a value of a few million based on their fundamentals.<p>In once sense that doesn&#x27;t matter. If you&#x27;re an early investor in such a unicorn you only need to convince some sucker to buy your shares while the hype is still hot. However, one needs to be a total fool to not understand that in such a game the music always stops playing at some point and someone is left holding a bag full of worthless $#&!.<p>The early players in this game have long since cashed out and are on a nice beach somewhere. The challenge for today&#x27;s &#x27;unicorns&#x27; is that they&#x27;re starting to venture into nightmarish territory for businesses... i.e. massively overvalued without the fundamentals to stop a free fall. The number of recent tech IPOs where shares have plunged 50+% shortly after floating (or were forced into a recent big down round) are a strong sign that the market&#x27;s tolerance for hype-based valuation is disappearing quickly. For those companies in that boat it&#x27;s quickly going to become a game of put up or shut up. The solid business will survive but the rest will implode or be sold for pennies on the dollar in a fire sale down the line.",1449065748

Rail and aircraft operators are companies that take responsibility for the lives of a large number of people and that typically have a long term view, as in, they&#x27;d like to be in business in half a century or more.<p>Tourbus operators (not the same as public transport) are responsible for a large number of the road traffic accidents involving buses, public transport involving buses is involved in accidents at a much lower rate. The reasons are: tourbuses tend to go faster, drive <i>much</i> longer distances (exhaustion), drive routes that are less safe to begin with and so on.<p>The way the rail industry deals with a capacity problem on a line is not to send more trains with a decreased train-to-train spacing but simply to send longer trains.<p>You can&#x27;t really make longer buses beyond a certain maximum length due to the fact that the minimum turning radius of roads is a very small fraction of the minimum turning radius of a train.",1449065153

In other words, you can make a full connection to \n  those systems and send (but not receive) data while spoofing a different\n  IP address. The target&#x27;s logs will show the spoofed IP, and you can take \n  advantage of any trust relationship between them. This attack was all the\n  rage in the mid-nineties when people commonly used rlogin to allow logins \n  to their account without any password from trusted IP addresses. \n  Kevin Mitnick is alleged to have used this attack to break into Tsutomu Shimomura&#x27;s \n  computers in December 1994.\n  \n  The good news is that hardly anyone uses rlogin anymore, and many operating \n  systems have been fixed to use unpredictable initial sequence numbers \n  as proposed by RFC 1948. For these reasons, this line is only printed in \n  verbose mode. Sadly, many vendors still ship vulnerable operating systems \n  and devices.

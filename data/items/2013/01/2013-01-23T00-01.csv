They both can take advantage of a completely concurrent garbage collector and all the other goodies. Some modules can be written in Erlang some in Elixir.<p>Indeed!<p>> Elixir it seems very easily can call Erlang functions. I don't know about vice-versa though.<p>Vice-versa is also true. :)<p>Given you have an Elixir module called String, you can it from Erlang as:<p><pre><code>    'Elixir-String':upcase(<<""fin"">>)
</code></pre>
I agree 'Elixir-String' is not the prettiest sight but this is because Erlang had an experimental feature called packages that forbade us from using 'Elixir.String'. Luckily, this ""feature"" is being removed from R16 and in the future you should be able to simply call 'Elixir.String'. There is more information about integration with Erlang in the crash course:<p><a href=""http://elixir-lang.org/crash-course.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elixir-lang.org/crash-course.html</a><p>> Choosing a default value of nil seems arbitrary.<p>nil would be an arbitrary choice if you look only at 'if'. But if the language constructs and the standard library consistently uses nil, it is coherent. In Erlang, not having a matching if raises an error, accessing an unknown key in process dictionary returns the atom 'undefined' and accessing an unknown key in a dict returns the atom 'error' or raises an error (depending on the function you call). In Elixir, they would all return nil. This is extremely important, because it allows you to create conveniences around nil, like the operators && and ||.",1358902403

5100686,comment,5099485,5100526,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I'd be interested in knowing your (brudgers) history with this to put that statement into context. Your blog doesn't offer much insight.<p>I ask because the statement ""Red hat[sic] isn't cut out to be a full stack partner"" is unsupported. Followed by the comment on ""38M PC's Dell sells"" in a year missed the point completely.<p>The margin in Dell's business is in servers. Not 'desktops' and not 'laptops' (which may be your primary exposure to the company, but I don't know). The successful enterprise server companies (IBM, HP, and to some extent Sun/Oracle) benefit from that 'full stack' support, but one of Red Hat's challenges has been that no single partner (with the possible exception of Supermicro) can extract the necessary cooperation from the third party device makers to get the support they need to drivers. IBM, HP, or Sun can say to Marvell ""We're going to use your SATA controller in our xyz-666-3245-665-/A controller, if we can get driver source
code and 24hr turn around on support issues."" Those agreements will usually put a few exemplar machines inside of Marvell (or what ever vendor) which will work with the company to insure that the driver does everything it should and nothing it shouldn't. And more importantly when it breaks it gives enough information to turn around a fix in short order. Those relations cost resources and really are only affordable to companies that have a solid presence in the enterprise space. (or in places like Google where a lot of servers are being used internally)<p>Dell using Red Hat for their server OS partner, might feel more comfortable, and have better pricing control, than Dell using Microsoft as a partner. And at server volumes and margin points such a strategy is very doable. You could even play Canonical off the Red Hat guys for a bit of competitive pressure. All of that is cheaper than building a new distro team in house and not one of Dell's core competencies.<p>The more interesting statement though is the last one, <i>""Nevermind that partnering with Microsoft made Michael Dell a billionaire and the thirty year relationship between the companies. Or the lack of a roadmap for Linux and a mobile strategy.""</i><p>That is all accurate, but what is the truth? And this is where we have to guess. Was the lack of a Linux and mobile strategy <i>because</i> of the partnering with Microsoft? Or was it just a bad guess? If it was the former, then having Microsoft own a big chunk is a problem, if it was the latter then you're not going to get very quality advice from Microsoft based on Microsoft's track record on Linux and Mobile. Either way, what ""was"" for Dell may have lead up to their current situation, but seems pretty clear that continuing on with the same plan they have had for the last 10 years isn't going to result in success.<p>That leaves us on HN taking potshots at these dribs and drabs of information.

5100680,comment,5099741,5100560,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"That has a good practical benefit (deduplication of files that most benefit from deduplication), but it doesn't actually solve the security problems at all, it's just choosing to make the trade off one way for large files and a different way for smaller files. If you have a legitimate reason to want privacy against data confirmation attacks then you need what you need regardless of file size.<p>The whole thing with deduplication is a little bit overblown anyway. You don't want a hundred copies of the same big file, but is that what really happens? Nobody wants to upload the same file a hundred times, especially if the file is very large. Once there is already a copy, passing around a link to it is much easier than uploading it again. So the most common cause for it to happen is when two totally unrelated people upload the same bit-for-bit identical file, which happens, but not so often as to be prohibitive.<p>And in many cases file-level deduplication is difficult or impossible anyway because users make changes to the files (like editing embedded metadata or pointlessly encapsulating a single already-compressed file into a .rar archive), so the benefits you get from deduplication are not nothing, but there are situations where it is or isn't a reasonable trade off to make against privacy.",1358902217

So it fit programs well, to some extent.<p>But text is limited. Programs contains many kinds of information, that don't fit well with a textual representation. Hierarchical data, scope, branching flow, loops, etc. After you realize this, you can also replace text commands, with symbolic representations that are easier to parse visually, and that can convey their function better than just text.<p>You need to maintain an appropriate level of information density. This one of the thing that has made text representation of programs successfully.<p>The other key thing is the UI. We are highly productive in manipulating text with editors. A successful graphical language has to beat that. It has to make possible to manipulate the information more efficiently: faster, and with less muscular effort.

It has run huge surpluses (on the order of tens of millions of dollars) for years, even as the cost per page has increased from $0.08 to $0.10.

I believe it should be freely available, and should be freely available in bulk form.<p>My only point was that providing open access to cases so that individuals can learn the law is a solved problem via Google Scholar. Bulk access <i>is not a problem for individuals</i>. I say this as someone who has worked to create better legal research tools for nearly 5 years: the first 2 on a startup that failed, the next 1 at Scholar, and the last 1.5 on a new startup that I believe will finally succeed.<p>So while the desire to open up PACER - and the attention given to it - is great, I don't think it will have any effect on the future of individual access to law, or to the future of innovation and business in the legal space. I don't think lack of innovation <i>today</i> has anything to do with lack of bulk access <i>today</i>.

Partly, no doubt, this was due to my professor (Brian Harvey) who was a brilliant lecturer and very good at designing the course. However, largely, this was due to the textbook, the material and the language.<p>I think Scheme's fundamental advantage over Python is simplicity. There is, essentially, no syntax. Even the fundamental language features are not accorded any especial syntactic status. This makes it clear that the course is about <i>computation</i> rather than any particular facet of it.<p>Moreover, Scheme is truly paradigm. Language like Python and Java are staunchly imperative--they might pay lip service to functional programming, but it's clearly an afterthought. Things like loops and assignment are deeply embedded into those languages.<p>Scheme, on the other hand, is just as happy with procedural code as with functional code. Moreover, it introduces OOP not as a built-in language feature but as a set of useful patterns. This really helps broaden students' perspectives. You can even reuse exactly the same syntax for non-deterministic and logic programming.",1358899339

The resolution on that thing was really crappy, but I guess nobody cared since our computers were equally crappy at the time.  The Mavica came out around late 1998.<p>I doubt anyone actually owned the Sony Mavica for their own ""personal"" uses.  It ran out of battery after 30 pictures or so, and you needed to carry around a bunch of floppies.  My crappy disposable camera could take better pictures than that thing.<p>I'm not sure if I would consider the 3.5"" floppy disk as a ""relevant sized mass storage"" but 1.4mb was probably pretty big in those days.

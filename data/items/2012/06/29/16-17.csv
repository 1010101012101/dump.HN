You can't therefore logically conclude that the language influences success. It's like comparing the number of millionaires in the US with the number of millionaires in Canada; the US has a bigger population compared to Canada, and all things being more or less equal, it's reasonable to expect that the US would have more millionaires simply because of its shear size.",1340989196

It is very convenient, and obvious, way to look at a web request as a referentially transparent function for the most part.  And the non referentially transparent requests really do change the world.  We are moving our backend to a bunch fairly clear workflow of, that has layers that look like:<p>Get DB stuff -> referentially transparent -> Write DB stuff<p>And these can be arbitrarily nested.  It works pretty well, it's easy to reason about, and it's pretty easy to write.",1340989188

I love this post because it does not look down on PHP programmers, it beautifully illustrates the situation we find ourselves in . PHP is quick easy , and convenient . We are so comfortable in our current state that we don't want to adapt to a better alternative .<p>You have built successful and high profile applications in PHP, thus invalidating the argument that PHP is useless .  \nThere may be better alternatives , but we must step out of our comfort zone to embrace them .<p>This post helped me understand the situation so much better. It does not insult or degrade  PHP programmers for their language choice , but it gently suggests that better alternatives exist ,and it is worth the short term pain to explore them .<p>Thanks again , Marco.

Ppl who think languages are just a means to an end think languages are just a means to an end. These are two differenty species and indicative of their particular worldview, attitude and preferences. To use that as any kind of filter is silly.<p>Lets not look at CS for a second...If you want to know what a Stieltjes integral is, a probabilist will tell you one thing, a functional analyst another, and a measure theorist will give you yet another more pedantic definition. There's no right or wrong definition here...every one is coming at it with the tools they are more well versed in. The probabilist is the end-user, so to speak. He can't do his day to day work without internalizing it, because his bread and butter, the PDFs and CDFs of all the distributions he deals with, comes from Stieltjes. The functional analyst is going to use Stieltjes when he deals with Banach spaces, but otherwise he has other preoccupations. The measure theorist studies Stieltjes in depth because it goes to the very foundantion of measure theory...but he isn't really an end-user.<p>Now back to CS...a C++ programmer will think of Java as an interesting toy because you don't get union types and pointers & so forth. The Java guy will think of Python as an interesting toy, and the Python guy thinks PHP is an interesting toy. None of this means any of these people are insecure or being a teenager.

I knew a bit of python (from having written a few trivial sysadmin related scripts) but apart from that I was starting cold. I'm now a few weeks in and while I'm not ready yet to jump ship back to my PHP comfort zone, I can say I've been surprised to find that Python (one of the ""better, grown up"" languages that's always cited in these PHP bashing threads) has quite a few warts of its own:<p>- Packaging in python seems to have been a nightmare up until quite recently. It appears things are a little more sane now that pip is emerging as the new standard but there's still documentation all over the web referencing easy_install. Of course, then there's distutils2 to muddy the waters...<p>- The Python 2 to Python 3 transition was and continues to be an almighty upheaval. At the moment huge swathes of the python ecosystem have yet to introduce python3 support (e.g. Flask).<p>- Virtualenv is a fairly ugly hack in itself but even worse than that, trying to move a virtualenv directory somewhere else on the file system turns out to be impossible unless you use another third party tool.<p>- The python language has no switch statement. I refused to believe it when I first discovered this but it is actually true.<p>So, two weeks or so in and those are my main gripes thus far. Apart from that, I'm enjoying python. My favourite ""python thing"" discovered so far is all the cool list iteration syntax.",1340989043

I think this service might have a lot of advantages, most of all, it should not annoy the user. In my view this service would help developers to keep a strict contact with the users, something that i think it's very important and it's usually appreciated the user. I do not want this to be something just to keep the user engaged.<p>Some examples of how this could be used:<p>- Send notifications about the status of your service/app<p>- Get in touch with specific users to provide support<p>- Messages directed to specific platforms<p>- Fast feedback from specifed users, like if there is someone who uses a feature more than other, ask why.<p>- Give rewards to your most passionate users.<p>In the end i would say that this is a service to let the users know that you are there.\nI have a quite clear view of all of this even if i might not have expressed it in the best way. I even have already something in my hands. but i wish to know if this is something that people might actually like/use.<p>Thanks :)",1340988127

4177516,comment,4176075,4176075,3,0,wvenable,,,"I wish bloggers would stop quoting that fractal article.  At least 50% of what's written in there is totally wrong/false. Other information is terribly out of date. And even more information is merely half-truths and lack of understanding of the language.  The article author clearly scanned through PHP bashing articles and took material from them verbatim; mistakes and all.<p>I'm not going to argue that PHP is a great language, but the article is a complete disservice to anyone who has bothered to read it.  I'm disappointed, but not surprised, that Jeff Atwood linked to it.<p>Just a few errrors in that article:<p>> Operators are very fragile in the parser; foo()[0] and foo()->method() are both syntax errors. The former is allegedly fixed in PHP 5.4, but I cant find mention of a fix for the latter.*<p>The latter doesn't need a fix because it always worked. Honestly, how hard is it to test that foo()->method() works?<p>> Objects compare as greater than anything else except other objects, which they are neither less than nor greater than.<p>Strict-equals on objects compares the references; but regular equals compares the contents of the objects. Two objects compare equal if the contain exactly the same fields and values. Seems pretty reasonable to me.<p>> + is always addition, and . is always concatenation.<p>This is a good thing; JavaScript gets this wrong.<p>> There is no way to declare a variable. Variables that dont exist are created with a null value when first used.<p>Variables that don't exist issue a notice. You can deal with that just like any other error.<p>> Global variables need a global declaration before they can be used.<p>Actually there is also the $GLOBALS array for this. I'll agree that's not much a solution. Globals should just not be used; if you want to use static class variables, it's a much better choice with a sane syntax.<p>> theres no pass-by-object identity like in Python.<p>I'm not sure if I understand this but all objects are passed-by-reference in PHP (since 5) and PHP references act appropriately when used as function parameters, etc.<p>> A reference can be taken to a key that doesnt exist within an undefined variable (which becomes an array). Using a non-existent array normally issues a notice, but this does not.<p>An attempt to use the reference will result in a notice but isset() and empty() operate it on it correctly.<p>> Constants are defined by a function call taking a string; before that, they dont exist.<p>You can declare constants in classes and namespaces with the const keyword.<p>> Theres an (array) operator for casting to array. Given that PHP has no other structure type, I dont know why this exists.<p>You can cast scalars to single element arrays and objects to arrays with the same structure. Both are actually very useful.<p>> include() and friends are basically Cs #include: they dump another source file into yours. There is no module system, even for PHP code.<p>PHP is interpreted -- namespaces and autoloaders are PHP's module system.<p>> Appending to an array is done with $foo[] = $bar<p>This is a good thing.<p>> empty($var) is so extremely not-a-function that anything but a variable,<p>Empty is equivalent to the not operator but will also work on undefined variables -- that's why it requires a variable.<p>> Theres redundant syntax for blocks: if (...): ... endif;, etc.<p>Useful inside of templates where matching { } is much more difficult.<p>> PHPs one unique operator is @ (actually borrowed from DOS), which silences errors.<p>Sometimes you don't care if a function succeeds; like with the unlink() function which will raise an error if the file you're trying to delete doesn't exist.<p>> PHP errors dont provide stack traces.<p>Not true. Debug_backtrace() will give you a stack trace in an error handler.<p>> Most error handling is in the form of printing a line to a server log nobody reads and carrying on.<p>Assuming, of course, the programmer doesn't do anything to handle errors.<p>> E_STRICT is a thing, but it doesnt seem to actually prevent much and theres no documentation on what it actually does.<p>E_STRICT (or lack of it) is for compatibility with PHP4. When enabled it will ""warn you about code usage which is deprecated or which may not be future-proof."" -- quote from the manual.<p>> E_ALL includes all error categoriesexcept E_STRICT.<p>Unfortunate naming here -- E_ALL is from PHP4 and prior and E_STRICT is all about PHP5. Including it in E_ALL would break PHP4 scripts running on PHP5.<p>> Weirdly inconsistent about whats allowed and what isnt.<p>This author is confused why syntax errors would be parse errors but logic errors are not.<p>> PHP errors and PHP exceptions are completely different beasts. They dont seem to interact at all.<p>This is sort of true; PHP errors and exceptions exist in different universes but it's easy to unify them and PHP even provides a built-in exception ErrorException to do so. You can turn every PHP error into an exception with 4 lines of code complete with stack traces. You could even turn exceptions into errors but I wouldn't recommend that.  PHP supports both procedural and OO programming styles -- this is not a bad thing.<p>> There is no finally construct<p>C++ also doesn't have a finally construct. But C++ and PHP support RAII -- class destructors run when the stack is unwound so you can do your cleanup.  Finally would be a welcome addition to both languages.<p>> function foo() { return new __stdClass(); } leaks memory. The garbage collector can only collect garbage that has a name.<p>PHP is reference counted with a cycle-detecting GC. That would not leak memory.<p>> Function arguments can have type hints, which are basically just static typing. But you cant require that an argument be an int or string or object or other core type<p>This is true, but it's an ongoing discussion on how to correctly handle scalar type hints. For all the discussion about how PHP isn't designed the author takes issue with the thing they're taking their time on.<p>> Closures require explicitly naming every variable to be closed-over. Why cant the interpreter figure this out?<p>Because of the dynamic abilities of PHP, there is simply no way for the interpreter to ever figure out the variable to close over. The solution is actually a rather simple.<p>> clone is an operator?!<p>Of course!<p>> Object attributes are $obj->foo, but class attributes are $obj::foo. Im not aware of another language that does this or how its useful.<p>C++ does it. $obj::foo doesn't make any sense, if you're accessing class attributes then you use the class name Class::foo.<p>> Also, an instance method can still be called statically (Class::method()). If done so from another method, this is treated like a regular method call on the current $this. I think.<p>Only static methods can be called statically.  The other calling methods statically is similar to C++ ... you can call parent class methods explicitly by name by-passing any overriding.<p>> new, private, public, protected, static, etc. Trying to win over Java developers? Im aware this is more personal taste, but I dont know why this stuff is necessary in a dynamic language<p>This is personal taste not a valid critique.<p>> Subclasses cannot override private methods.<p>That is the definition of private methods!<p>> There is no method you can call on a class to allocate memory and create an object.<p>You can use reflection to create an object without calling the constructor.<p>> Static variables inside instance methods are global; they share the same value across all instances of the class<p>This is the definition of a static property!<p>> Yet a massive portion of the standard library is still very thin wrappers around C APIs<p>That is, in fact, the point. PHP is supposed to be a thin scripting language layer over C. It's expanded beyond that. Many of the poor naming conventions are not because of PHP but rather are the exact API of the underlying C library.<p>> Warts like mysql_real_escape_string, even though it has the same arguments as the broken mysql_escape_string, just because its part of the MySQL C API.<p>Both the C API and PHP have both these functions for backwards compatibility reasons.  This entire API is pretty much depreciated with both the mysqli library and PDO replacing it.<p>> Using multiple MySQL connections apparently requires passing a connection handle on every function call.<p>Yes, exactly.  That's the only way multiple connections could possibly work.<p>> PHP basically runs as CGI. Every time a page is hit, PHP recompiles the whole thing before executing it.<p>Unless you use a free code cache like APC. It will eventually be built in.  Most people don't need it.<p>> For quite a long time, PHP errors went to the client by default<p>If you don't handle your errors, they go somewhere.<p>> Missing features<p>Most of these are provided by frameworks just as they are in Python, Ruby, C#, etc.<p>> Insecure-by-default<p>Most of these things are now removed from the language after being depreciated for years.",1340987785

So, I'd suggest talking about ""knowledge management and collaboration"" as your beach-head and WHY you've selected that as your beach-head...and, possibly most importantly, why traction within this beach-head will allow you to tackle some of the other markets you have on your radar more easily.<p>Also talk briefly about the potential market size of your other target markets. You don't have to have all the answers for your other markets -- after all, they are not your target market, yet -- but you should show some knowledge about those markets and be able to talk convincingly about how your product solves a real problem in those markets.<p>As for market expertise: I think it comes down to two things. How long have you been working in that industry and how many contacts do you have so that you're not jumping in cold. If you don't have either of these, it's going to be a big red flag. I'm guessing you have had some way of validating the problem, so I am going to focus on the network problem.

I believe it relates to the ulimit issue Paul mentioned in another comment which was fixed some time ago (i.e. the file was there, but the user was out of file descriptors)... not sure yet. Either way, we need to catch the exception properly.<p>As a general tip to all those hosting a Node app in production, you can catch uncaught exceptions with:<p>process.on('uncaughtException', function(err) {\n  console.log(err);\n});<p>This ensures anything which goes wrong unexpectedly will be logged to your console, rather than sent to the browser - not good!<p>SocketStream doesn't currently do this for you by default, but maybe it should (in production mode). It's something I will consider implementing in the near future.<p>So far my focus has been on creating a great dev environment.

I firmly believe the system of asking stupid algorithmic trivia is hackable and should be hacked because it is a broken rotten system that keeps incredibly amazing hackers out. There has been a ton of stuff said about interviews so I will keep this brief:<p>1. Get a github account, publish code, keep a social media profile etc. At the very least, this gets you interview calls.<p>2. People are not that creative with tech questions. Even Google (at least these days) asks you questions that come out of a textbook. So go through one, say like Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual and solve all the problems on a white board. This sucks a ton because when I sketch out code for a project, I never go do it on a whiteboard. The trick is to get to the stage where you can mentally compose the main blocks of the problem in your head and then writing down the answer on the whiteboard. This means that when you hit the whiteboard with the engineer staring at you from back, you know pretty much what way you want to go at the problem.<p>2.1. Statistically speaking of the countless interviews I have done, I think a large proportion of questions have been on trees, graphs and dynamic programming. I feel like this is because ""some people"" think that these are exotic enough that solving these problems have some correlation with smartness. Again, solve a few problems from any textbook on these or maybe go through the TopCoder tutorials on the matter and they start getting as easy as a day to day programming problem.<p>3. Accept the fact that people are paranoid about false positives and don't really care about false negatives. Sometimes if you have a bad day, it is not you.<p>4. Someone mentioned this before but interview more. Talk to people you like, you hate and people whom you have no intention of working with. This will help you get over your insecurities and make you realize that interviews are just a game: You will get more confident, and believe me, that helps. (This is just like dating, the more you do of it the more you get better ;-)<p>4.1 Organize your interviews so that your dream bets are towards the end of your process by which time you will have done so many problems, attended so many behavioral interviews, talked to so many people that you will be absolutely amazing!",1340987243

4177451,comment,4175646,4177096,1,0,anacrolix,,,"Damn straight, good rant. The claim about it being simpler to leave the GIL is true. As Nick mentions, there are 2 reasons why it's desirable to remove the GIL:<p>1) CPU bound work. Generally breaking up CPU bound stuff needs to be coarse grained anyway. By migrating to process-based parallelism, you potentially incur communication overheads, and library issues. Both of these can (in my opinion) for the most part be worked around.<p>2) Concurrency. The standard workaround here is to use threads until the context switching overhead destroys your performance, or use one of the growing number of concurrency libraries. Twisted, Tornado, gevent and others for example. The issue here is that it's very difficult to vet code to not block your chosen framework. Horror stories abound where this occurs in some rare case and brings down servers or destroys throughput. Here I think Python critically needs to standardize on <i>something</i>, but drags its feet because it requires breaking compatibility with the C ecosystem in CPython. That in turn makes it pointless to use Python unless it has C-like performance of its own, which it does not.<p>Clearly full threading parallelism is required. To that end, PyPy with STM enhancements is the only thing on the radar that has the potential to do this, may we all look forward to it. Further, GCC and other C compiler should start providing builtin STM support in the next few years, this is another opportunity to replace the GIL without endangering the implementations simplicity.",1340987067

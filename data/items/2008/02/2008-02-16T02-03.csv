Quoting again:<p>Here it is: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.<p>Perfect.",1203130596

116813,comment,116768,116768,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""When I first laid out these principles explicitly, I noticed something striking: this is practically a recipe for generating a contemptuous initial reaction.""<p>Jeffrey Rosen has some good stuff to say about this in his book The Unwanted Gaze. One of his defenses of the right to privacy is that new ideas often seem wrong at first, especially when they're still only half baked. And because of this, progress is seriously impeded when the government has the ability to go through our journals and sketchbooks at any time. This is especially true in our made-for-TV society where most people won't put more than thirty seconds into trying to understand something, esp. considering the factors PG mentions. He suggests that for these reasons innovation may not be possible in a fully transparent society.",1203129225

Where is the final, perfect Lisp that's so easy to write?<p>What you seem to be saying is that being smart automatically makes people good at language design. And you are just dead wrong.  Being smart may make you a good language implementor, but there's little correlation between that and the kind of skills you need to be a good language designer.  Some of the worst languages in the world were designed by smart people.<p><i>It's a big problem when your users are contemptuous, because that means they don't need your project.</i><p>The Arc users on arclanguage.org don't seem that contemptuous.<p><i>So instead of doing things with the language, they do things to the language.</i><p>That seems a good sign to me.  Munging the language is what you do with Lisp, like numerical calculations are what you do with Fortran.  So what this means to me is that the users are real Lisp hackers, using the language as Lisp is meant to be used.<p>Plus I explicitly said that at this stage I'm mostly interested in the core language, and that I want to hear new ideas in that department.",1203128493

I mean, if they merely got it to the point where you could go to a fuel station, plug it in to charge and go in to grab a coke and by the time you get to the cashier your car is charged.<p>I mean, combine this with regenative braking and thin-film solar cells (so as not to add unnecessary weight and lower mileage), you could greatly improve over most current full-electric cars.",1203128299

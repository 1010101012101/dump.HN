But some big names definitely contribute (Google, Yahoo, Apple to an extent...).<p>There is also plenty of innovation done by people in their spare time.  So much so, that software patents are a hot issue: who wants to be sued for making something cool, only to find out that Microsoft claimed it a year ago?<p>It's also funny they don't mention Microsoft or other companies whose actions alone were enough to freeze innovation in several areas.  If your goal is to make money, you can't compete with the establishment...you have to move on.",1220492770

What distinguishes the really scary weapons from home-brew isn't the science behind it, but all the engineering tweaks that optimize the results.  Given his background and Q clearance in DOE, even if he wasn't my dad, I'd be inclined to believe him....",1220492712

It will push other developers to be better, kind of like how iphone pushed other phone manufacturers to be better... but in both cases that is more or less an advantage of being late to market.<p>Anyway, the point is that I think you might have swallowed the hype a little bit too much in believing that Google is the first generation of browsers that was ""designed"" for web apps because it was designed to run them better than the many generations before it.<p>That would be like saying Chuck Yeager was the first man to do powered flight because he broke the sound barrier first.<p>The Wright brothers would not be amused.",1220492560

And further, what innovations from decades ago are we still relying on today and not innovating through?<p>In so many areas, from medicine to biotech to clean energy to nanotechnology to space exploration to the web, we are seeing new waves of progress and research.

In the same way, javascript can't overtake flash in many aspects.<p>Flash will inevitably (if Chrome wants to be a widely used browser) be compatible with the Chrome browser. And people will use it and life will go on. Chrome does not in any way affect what happens to flash.<p>Silverlight on the other hand, is a piece of shit because Mac adoption rate is quickly picking up, because people like ME use LINUX, and because none of us were able to watch the fucking silverlight videos on NBC for the olympics.<p>That makes me just a tad angry.",1220490779

294404,comment,293942,294030,0,0,netcan,,,"I don't think it's fair to call it a misconception. It is a claim or maybe even an accusation. One that Universities are are commonly accused of. One that is being extended to YC.<p>Universities might similarly defend against this claim by pointing to the resources spent on educating as opposed to filtering. But I don't think that this is necessarily a good defence. If anything, it points to an institution's internal priorities, not its value to potential students.<p>It seems to me that if YC is consistently successful, it can't avoid becoming a filter in the eyes of investors. This would eventually come to affect applicants' perception. If YC increases a company's chance of attracting investors, this might become the motivation for participation. Investors listen to pitches or even invest because of YC's track record. Startups apply because of investors' perception.<p>Similarly, University applicants often think along the lines of creating an impressive resume. This is partly because it is true (an Oxford degree is better at getting jobs then an unknown one) and partly because people tend to undervalue educational potential of things beforehand.<p>Throw in the fact that top Universities get the power to choose the best applicants & it becomes difficult to tell if they are picking winners, creating them or just in control of some bottleneck.<p>In any case, I think it's a point of interest.",1220490543

There was also some damage in WWII but despite all that the city is mostly intact.<p>And don't be fooled by the modern convenience of the Outlet Mall (which is beyond the remnants of the old city wall). Most of the shoppers are German (not that there's anything wrong with that) and incidentally there are several short-haul bike routes into Germany. There's a bike shop next to the train station and there are a few cute German towns within 20km.",1220490495

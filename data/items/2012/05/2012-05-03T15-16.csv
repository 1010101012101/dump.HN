Actually, you work X - 4 hours a week, every week the entire year with no vacation, such that it you actually work X hours every week, you end up with (52 x 4 =) 208 hours of vacation a year.<p>So, for example, I'm in crunch mode for the next week working X+3 or X+4 hours a day.

This makes sense - the bigger problem (expanding the size of the pool) is beyond the influence of almost all employers (maybe the giants facebook and google can influence this somewhat).<p>As a result, only very incremental progress can be made.  If the standard salary is 70k, employers will balk at offering more than 80k.  If they have to offer 90k, they'll feel that a bad shortage exists, because they're offering way above the ""market"" salary - causing them to conclude that good devs can't be had ""at any price"".<p>Here's what I think they don't get - to really solve this, they need to start attracting people from other professions.  They need to get the top minds that are currently going into medicine, law, finance, and so forth (well, the percentage that could and would go into software development if they rewards were greater).<p>Honestly, I don't see industry ever making this jump.

Developers get caught up in the immediacy of their need, do a cursory search for something that fits, then roll their own if it is not immediately found.

The open source project has to lie somewhere between ""this is perfect"" and ""this will save me so much time with only minor modification.""<p>Github is helping to change this search problem, but there is much room for improvement.

We as a dev team decided it was time to roll it out when it wasn't. Our fault. This created a crisis mode. It was a rush - live editing code on production servers to save an engineer rollout (nature of the product was one mistake locked us out of the box), seeing small fixes improve conversion by noticable amounts (or reduce the call queue significantly), etc. Bad engineering practice, but it made me understand the cowboy appeal, and I don't think I want to do it again.<p>However, this resulted in a bit of crisis addiction, followed by burnout. However, the CEO learned that crisis mode was a death march motivator. Suddenly it turned into crisis-this and crisis-that. Every small feature was a ""drop everything we'll lose customers"" crisis. It started wearing pretty quick. At some point he dropped the crisis act and just stated flatly that ""your terms of employment state that you will work as needed, i need you now"" the day before I had scheduled time off, and the ""crisis"" was getting a new feature complete for shipping in a year.

Of-course the quality varies depending on which school district you live.

Depending on the insurance plan sometime you will have some out of pocket costs (lke $20 copay per doctor visit etc).<p>3, Vacation - Most companies offer around 2 weeks of paid vacation a year (in addition to sick leaves).

It's a mish-mash of ideas, badly mish-mashed together. I don't want to use a mediocre language.<p>- It's object-oriented, but not consistently so (len() anyone?)<p>- It's object-oriented, but not really the standard library (derive from dict? Oh, no, you should derive from UserDict then. dict isn't a class, didn't you know that?)<p>- The language's evolution shines through even more than that of PHP. First it was ""functions! short little functions! those are easy!"" (except ""print"", come on, that's so common that we must make it a statement), then came some data structures, <i>then</i> came objects and classes, so they backported those datastructures onto OO stuff, but not entirely, and oh by the way here's some additional magic functions for some more magic because magic is cool! And lambdas cause hey, you asked. (note: if this isn't the real history of Python, then I apologize to the apostles; to me it <i>feels</i> like this is the history)<p>- It supports functional programming constructs, but in such a limited fashion that any code not written in a imperative style quickly gets very hairy and difficult to understand.<p>- It's batteries included, but half the APIs are hell (admittedly, this is getting fixed with the whole ""for humans"" hype)<p>- Package management is hell. easy_install isn't easy, oh and it's not installed by default so good luck figuring that other library's ""getting started"" tutorial out. But hey, you need pip for this! Doh, pip is the new best thing. Except for those database drivers there, they have an installer. Oh, and they'll only work on Python 2.7.1 32-bit, but they won't warn you if this doesn't match cause that would make the code longer! We hate long code. BTW, I've heard this is less bad on non-Windows, but still, what's wrong with a single package management system, shipped with the language?<p>- Its documentation is complete, but very limited. Few examples, a lot of information vaguely hidden in very short sentences. What are this function's argument's types? Is this index value here zero or one based? What type does it return, and why can't I click on that to get to that type's documentation?<p>Now, none of these are horrible sins. In all honesty, maybe I'm overreacting with the garbage man thing. But Python is <i>so</i> popular, and only growing in popularity, and IMHO entirely undeservedly so. If Python was as popular as, say, Lua, I'd probably have complained less.<p>For a language with pretty much the same ""general"" featureset (dynamically typed, big community, multi-paradigm, low entry-barrier), I think Ruby does it better on all fronts except docs.

With modern IDEs and refactoring tools being pretty powerful weapons, this has a major impact on programmer productivity.<p>Of course, there is no reason why some sort of refactoring / code inspection support can't be added to dynamically typed languages, but it's certainly more difficult to make, and more error-prone.<p>I believe that in the next decade, this gap will widen, and that because of this, some statically typed language will be the next hip language.

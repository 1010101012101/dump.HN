7263146,comment,7262662,7263045,2,0,yoha,,,"Initially, Tor and I2P only pass information from one node to another while obfuscating it. At either end, you can now what the information is, but you do not know where it went through. It&#x27;s basically a tunnel that goes <i>somewhere</i>. It is why you can use Tor to browse the web: you just use it to hide where you are connecting from.<p>On the other hand, Freenet is a paranoia-driven network over the Internet which makes information available and resilient. There is no such thing as a webserver on Freenet. An encrypted version of the data is sent to some nodes and passed from one to another. You don&#x27;t know where the information comes from, you just get it at some point.<p>Finally, Tor implemented hidden services. This is almost the opposite of the initial situation where an user wants to access a known website without being known. The hidden service is hosted on some node, and you access it through the &quot;Tor tunnel&quot;, meaning that you don&#x27;t know where the service is. The user is still hidden by the network too.",1392810940

Well played!<p>> What makes the game so fascinating is how many different, exciting situations arise from a number of pretty simple game mechanics.<p>That&#x27;s also what make it frustrating sometimes: let me relate some fictional situation that depicts this. I have my multi-shielded ship with my crew of 4 against a powerless enemy. Oh, they just teleported a boarding drone into my oxigen module, making a breach on the way. I can only send two of my men at the time and the heal module is far away. In the mean time, they have not been able to get through my shields and I have deactivated almost all their weapons. <i>almost</i>. A teleported bomb has started a fire in the shield module and destroyed it ; blaze is spreading to the heal module. Most of my crew is now half dead, I can only extinguish the fire by making vacuum, but cannot fill it back with air. In the mean time, the boarding drone has gotten to the weapon module. … Glad to have served with you on this ship. Open <i>all</i> doors.<p>On the plus side, if it is frustrating, it is also very humbling and makes you paranoid.

But the important point is that automotive interfaces are designed to be built into cars at the factory, and used for many years without requiring any updates. Even if updates are possible, most people don&#x27;t get them. So it&#x27;s a completely different mindset and approach and time scale than people from the Silicon Valley dot-com startup industry have.<p>Another factor is that the devices built into cars have a very long design and production lead time, and by the time the car comes out, the built in hardware and software is already quite obsolete compared to the smartphone the driver probably owns.<p>Factoring the problem out of the car to run in a smartphone or tablet itself also has its own frustrating problems, because when you&#x27;re designing an automotive computer system, you can&#x27;t predict what kind of technology and standards will be available or popular by the time it ships.<p>It&#x27;s a very difficult problem space, and the stakes are extremely high, not just financially, but also because cars are weapons of mass destruction that kill more people and destroy more property than all terrorists combined could possibly dream of.",1392809462

7263027,comment,7261003,7261768,3,0,SimHacker,,,"Memorably differentiating the possible commands is the reason I designed the layout of the pie menus in SimCity the way I did.<p>SimCity has a tool pallet of various building and editing tools, which are related to each other in various ways, and have different costs, functions and properties. I tried to arrange them into a set of submenus that made those relationships and differences more obvious and easier to learn. I also arranged the static tool palette on the screen to reflect the layout of the pie menus and submenus, to serve as a kind of map to the pie menus (which foreshadowed the spatial map design I explored with Method of Loci, described in another posting).<p>Here is a screen dump of the multi player version of SimCity running on a Sun workstation on TCL/Tk/X11: <a href=""http://www.donhopkins.com/home/catalog/simcity/SimCity-Sun.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.donhopkins.com/home/catalog/simcity/SimCity-Sun.g...</a><p>The top level menu includes: magic marker and eraser (for drawing on the map), roads and rails, power lines and a bulldozer, and submenus for common zones and bigger buildings. The zone submenu includes residential, commercial and industrial zones, police and fire stations, and a query tool. The building submenu includes a stadium, park and seaport, coal and nuclear power plants, and an airport.<p>As you can see, the size of the icon reflects the cost of the tool. The borders of the icons are color coded to reflect the cursor you see on the map that shows where the tool will affect. (That was useful for multi player mode, so you could see which tools the other players had selected, so the tool palette served as a legend for the cursors on the screen.) And the tool palette looks kind of like a totem pole, which is vertically asymmetrical, differentiating different kinds of tools and making them look unique, and horizontally symmetrical, reflecting pairs of similar tools and making it look aesthetically pleasing.<p>If all the tools were the same sized squares arranged in a regular grid, it would be much harder to differentiate them and quickly select the one you want. Instead, they&#x27;re arranged more like a bouquet of unique flowers that each have their own special features that make them easily recognizable and memorable, while telling you something about themselves.<p>Designing user interfaces this way is a artistic balancing act, highly dependent on the set of commands, and requiring a lot of iteration, testing and measurement, as well as willingness to explore and experiment with many different alternatives. It is not easy, and there is never a best solution, or even always a good one. It&#x27;s not something you can expect end-users to be able to do with their own custom built menus. But it&#x27;s worth the effort to try, and I think it&#x27;s also worth the effort to train designers and even users to promote a literacy in interface design.<p>One idea I&#x27;ve had is to develop a game called &quot;PieCraft&quot;, that has user-editable pie menus that are first-order in-game player craftable artifacts. World of Warcraft and its rich ecosystem of user interface extensions supports a wide range of player customizable user interfaces, because there are so many different commands, spells, buffs, weapons, armor, etc, and each role of each character of each player requires a totally different set of them in different situations. The more casual MMPORG &quot;Glitch&quot; had bags that users could arrange in hierarchies and put their items inside, which were surfaced on the user interface as buttons they could press and objects they could drag in and out of the world and other bags. How well you arrange your items in WoW and Glitch had a significant effect on gameplay.<p>PieCraft could take this further, to train players in user interface design literacy (much like &quot;Code Hero&quot; aims to train players in computer programming). You could find empty or pre-populated pie menus in the world, pick them up and make them your own, and edit them by moving items around, putting them inside of other menus, and modifying them as you leveled up and earned more powerful menu editing skills and resources. The capacity and layout and allowed contents of some menus could be restricted, to constrain the ways you used them, forcing you to figure out which were your most important items, and giving them front row seats so they were easiest to select.<p>To put further pressure on players to design efficient menus, your menus could be vulnerable to attack from warriors and theft from pickpockets while they were popped up, and only be able to take a limited amount of damage, before they would break open and spill their contents out all over the world! Then you (and your enemies) would scramble to pick up all the pieces, and you would be compelled to arrange your most important items so you could find and select them as quickly and easily as possible, so you could &quot;mouse ahead&quot; swiftly during combat and in crowded public settings, to avoid damage from attack and loss from thieves.",1392808386

No one ever said that single components should be built in a non-connected way. in fact, composability is a big part of good components. where ever did you get the idea that its the opposite?<p>why do you think imlib2 got so successful? but hey, care to explain to me what the advantage of merging udev with systemd was?",1392808344

Seriously.<p>If a candidate doesn&#x27;t have &quot;several hours&quot; to engage in a process intended to lead to both sides investing thousands of hours over the coming several years, they&#x27;re welcome to apply elsewhere.<p>For every time I&#x27;ve interviewed, I&#x27;ve done several hours of homework on the company, understanding their competitive position, reading their financials (if a public company), founder bios (if a startup), bios of the people I&#x27;ll be meeting with, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not doing this out of desperation; I&#x27;m doing it because I&#x27;m picking the company just as much as the company is picking me. Conversely, I&#x27;m willing to &quot;jump through hoops&quot; provided I believe that the company believes that hoop is helpful in selecting strong employees, because ultimately, I want to work at a company with strong colleagues and the hoop is a signal that the company wants the same thing.<p>Fair disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t applied anywhere in the last <long time> and in my 20s, I enjoyed the take-home programming challenges. To this day, I recall enjoying Acclaim (game company)&#x27;s take home test that was rudimentary AI for a turn-based very simple game. I crushed it, flew out to interview, and got an absolutely laughably low offer (par for the industry), but I still think fondly of &quot;doing that homework&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve also been asked head-scratchers before. I had a recruiter ask my GPA <i>and SAT scores</i> for a role in my late 20s. Wait, WTF did you just ask me?! I answered, and that firm (D. E. Shaw & Co.) was the most-talent dense firm over 5 employees that I&#x27;ve ever experienced. If I&#x27;d have indignantly replied that my SAT scores were irrelevant to the position and none of their damn business (both are arguably true), I&#x27;d have missed out on one of the best work experiences of my life (and two handfuls of those colleagues are still working with me today, 3 firms and 17 years later).<p>Anyway, sorry for the long response.<p>Shorter version:\nYou&#x27;re picking the company.

That means that you need to configure your containers to run something like supervisord and rsyslog to log to a remote server which is a bit of a hassle, especially if you were making use of public images since you&#x27;ll need to add all this boilerplate in yourself and rebuild the images.<p>Alternatively I guess you could log to the host if there are config options to log directly to syslog and you could then ship them from there.<p>I spent a couple of weeks writing a python app and the same again trying to sort out a flexible logging system. Ah well, I guess it&#x27;s still under development, but it&#x27;d be great if they prioritised this since it&#x27;s one of the major things stopping me using docker (and obviously I&#x27;m so important they should reprioritise around me!)<p>I really wish coreos was bundled with a package manager though. Not having telnet or the ability to apt-get install things easily makes any sort of debugging and real-world use infeasible for me... :-(",1392807625

1897807,comment,1897543,1897543,0,0,rbeale,,,"Hi -<p>When you qualify a prospect, you want to think about 4 letters BANT. Budget, Authority, Need, Timing.<p>1) Budget - does this prospect have enough money to afford my product/service\n2) Authority - Am I speaking with the decision maker (the person who holds the purse strings - typically CEO for businesses with less than 50 employees). For an educational institution, you will want to ask, ""how does your purchasing process work?"" You need to be able to uncover who the final decision maker is.\n3) Need - why do they NEED your product.  Please note that ""need"" is far different from ""want"" your product.  For example, is the educational institution behind on the technology curve?  What does your product do to give the educational institution a competitive advantage in either making professors more efficient or attracting more talented students?\n4) Timing - educational institutions are businesses.  They have budgets.  It is getting close to the end of 2010.  Perhaps purchasing your product is within the budget.... for 2011.  They may love your product but are waiting to pull the trigger on Jan 1, 2011.  How do you figure this out?  Well, you need to ask, What are the next steps on your end?<p>Every deal is different.  One thing that is consistent is BANT qualifying prospects.  If you can identify 1) a PROBLEM 2) a PAIN and 3) CONSEQUENCE - the probability of converting  leads into customers goes WAY UP.<p>Hope this helps. :)<p>Ryan",1289573689
1897806,comment,1895662,1897429,0,0,drats,,,"I said ""freedom"" and you changed that to ""greater good"" to try to win the argument. Stallman was pursuing his lifestyle, people started to mess with it, so he created a legal document to secure his own freedoms and those of others. This enabled him to live his life as he wanted and helped a lot of other people - many who disagree with him on points minor and major - to live their lives the way they want to. In that sense its an individualistic community that values freedom protected by a clever legal document. Now if you think ""making money"" describes the USA better than ""individualistic community that values freedom protected by a clever legal document"", you'd be wrong.<p>I am not from America, but looking from afar I often get sick of the crude anti-Americanism that seems to get an intellectual free pass all the time. What can be more American than high level science? Given the endless Nobel prizes and technical innovations of the USA I'd think you could point to the AI lab at MIT as being a good symbol (among many) for the American contributions to science. It's ultimately American. Smack bang in the middle of the one of the first states which has always been an intellectual powerhouse mirroring the parts of England from which its settlers first came. A place which also bears the name ""the Cradle of Liberty"" with many political triumphs. The ""blue states"", as a reductionist might call them, don't play themselves up to us in the rest of the world, or domestically, as often as they perhaps should; that doesn't mean they aren't powerful or haven't changed the world in massive ways. And more than just residing in a center of American liberty and intellectual achievement Stallman used a clever legal document to do it. Lawyer jokes aside, using the beautiful common law system to protect rights, what could be more American? Starting a revolution rather than play along with it when someone gets up in your face and starts messing with your lifestyle. Tell me which country fits that description better than the USA. Yes, there is more than one America, there is Wallstreet and the Ayn Rand impulse you point to. I am not denying those exist, but don't try to claim them as being the only America or claim that they are the summation of one of the most important countries (perhaps  ""<i>the</i> most important country"") in the history of human civilization. Stallman is as American as apple pie.",1289573684

When people are forced to speak a language that they do not know well they often end up reinforcing bad habits. Once someone has developed bad pronunciation or inadvertently trained themselves to ignore certain grammatical features it takes a lot of effort to correct the habits. Of course a committed learner can offset this to some degree, but most immigrants aren't willing to put in the effort and are only partially aware of the mistakes they are making. After three years they then speak in much the same way as they did after six months, but with a larger vocabulary.",1289573557

From the perspective of a non-programmer, a program is just a wall of text. I remember someone did the same basic experiment with program fragments (real vs. random) and got similar results.<p>Experts can write the focal elements (e.g. pseudocode) first and then expand them into a full program. A good example might be the fizzbuzz test, or generating the permutations of a string, you'll have an idea of what the problem involves because you've done it before.

That's exactly what social networks are: networks of trust. Pick some obvious trustworthy nodes to start, expand from there with diminishing trust as you get further away, increasing trust the more connections there are to someone who's trustworthy, and so on... there's probably a zillion great algorithms to calculate this.<p>Solving the problem of trust would basically solve the problem of identity, since identity (in real life as well as online) is a product of a trust network.",1289571151

However, if there had been another three plane-hijackings since 9/11 I don't think anyone would be complaining.

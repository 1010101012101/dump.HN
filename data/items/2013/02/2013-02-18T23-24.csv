5241678,comment,5240514,5241170,18,0,glabifrons,,,"""Personally I believe that patenting genes in first place is overall a bad idea...""<p>If they actually developed the genes themselves, I'd lean towards the thought that they should be patentable.<p>However, in this case (and in every case that I know of involving Monsanto) they've simply patented something they <i>discovered</i>, not something they <i>invented</i>.<p>The gene in this case is the ""Roundup Ready"" gene... which comes from a bacteria they discovered that was living in the soil they saturated with their Roundup poisons. They extracted this gene and inserted it into the plant by way of a virus... so they didn't invent the insertion method either (the virus did). Yes, they had a guiding hand in which gene got transferred, but that's process and that's not what they're suing over.<p>In other cases, they simply patented genes that they never even interacted with, such as the large hog gene. This is fundamentally broken... I'm not sure what happened to the rules against patenting nature/life.<p>As to the merits of this case, I can see it going either way - the arguments are definitely novel.<p>Personally, I think:<p>1. Patentability of discoveries (not inventions) should be examined closely (and discarded!). There used to be rules against patenting nature/life... as stated above, I'm not sure what happened to those (IA-quite-obviously-NAL).<p>2. SCOTUS should consider that Monsanto sells a product that is intended to be used to replicate itself - then suing people who use the end product as nature intended for further replication. Consider if this were a seed that produced a seedless fruit... you'd have to be a bit more creative than following nature to replicate the plant (grafting and such). That effort wasn't applied here at all.<p>3. SCOTUS should examine the fact that Monsanto has completely lost control of their product and that it should be viewed as an infection.<p>To elaborate on that last point, imagine you're an organic farmer and you go through an extreme amount of effort and cost to ensure you have truly organic seed. You plant this seed on your land that has been organic for >3 years (requirement for getting a USDA Organic label, as I understand it) and grow your crop. Bees come to gather nectar and in doing so, pollinate your crop (nature at work). Unfortunately, there's another farm within range of the bees that has Monsanto's crop growing, and your crop gets fertilized with the neighbor's pollen. The product of your hard work now contains Monsanto's genes, they come on your property without your permission, take parts of your crop for analysis, then 2 years later (ensuring you have no proof to fight it) they launch a lawsuit against you claiming you stole their product and sue you into bankruptcy. EDIT: Not only have you lost your current crop and your money, but you've also lost your organic label since you now have a non-organic crop growing in your fields (even though the non-organic part is only the product of the plant and not the plant itself).<p>This is not a theoretical possibility, this is their MO.
They're wiping out all sources (crop-reuse methods, included) of seed so all farmers will be forced to buy seed from them (they also control the majority of non-GMO seed, they've been buying up smaller seed companies for eons).<p>Edited for formatting and added one line to the 2nd-to-the-last paragraph.",1361231957

In this case, RapGenius is small and Salesforce is big, but the legal system will apply the same standard when the plaintiff is big and the defendent is poor. If this becomes precedent, then soon we will have lawyers trying to treat any public post by company employees as 'documentation', forcing startups to have a policy of not allowing their employees to freely help others with their product in public forums.

Gene regulatory networks for complex eukaryotes are on the order of neural networks in complexity and involve quantum-scale interactions, which opens the possibility of quantum effects being significant. Gene regulation within the neuron affects neural firing behavior and, more importantly, profoundly affects neural growth patterns and thus learning and longer term forms of cognition.<p>This also neglects the possibility (now considered probable) that more cell types than just neurons are involved in brain activity:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliotransmitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliotransmitter</a><p>In short: the brain is not a neural network. Rather, those mathematical connectionist models are just that: <i>models</i> of <i>aspects</i> of the brain. We do not yet know to what extent these other mechanisms play a role, and what their role is. Given their nature it seems in both cases that their role might be more long-term, affecting long duration learning, planning, etc.<p>It really seems to me as if the most ardent and enthusiastic adherents of the Kurzweilian vision are computer scientists who don't really respect the domain of biology and like to hand-wave away its complexity as ""background noise."" You can't do that. I say this as a lifelong computer programmer who has studied biology. Studying biology really blew away any notions I had of simple, classical computer programs becoming movie-style AI.<p>The author is <i>not</i> making an anti-scientific ""magic"" argument. He is simply pointing out that biological systems are analog, embodied, electrochemical (and thus physical and possibly quantum), nonlinear complex systems, and he is being skeptical about the idea that such a system is going to yield readily to digital computer simulation. I agree with his skepticism.<p>Prediction: brain simulations will simulate superficial brain behavior but they will not become sentient. More specific prediction: they will get stuck in closed cycle loops. They will not exhibit the higher order motivation, creativity, or learning behavior seen in brains, which is probably because these behaviors emerge from all the real embodied biophysical stuff the CS people are ignoring.",1361230536

The first comment on that version of the discussion is informative, and gets to the heart of the case, which is somewhat more specific than a lot of the commentary (though other issues are clearly implicated).<p>The core of it is whether the Supreme Court will read the patent-exhaustion doctrine narrowly or broadly. The traditional application of patent exhaustion allows you to combine a patented part with other standard equipment, if the patented part was purchased legally. So, for example, you can buy a CPU and then assemble it with other electronic components into a larger device, without getting a second patent license for the larger device.<p>The farmer here is arguing that buying a seed and having it reproduce should fall under patent exhaustion, because growing seeds and having them produce more seeds is something that, in farming, happens routinely by just adding ""standard equipment"" such as soil, fertilizer, and water. Therefore no second license should be needed for continued routine use of the legitimately purchased initial product. Buying a license to the seed should imply, by patent exhaustion, the regular use of the seed for all things seeds are normally expected to do, including planting them and harvesting their offspring. The counter-argument is that in the CPU example the original purchased part is still enclosed in the larger device, whereas in the seed case the offspring seeds are not a superset of the original seed, so the result is actually a copy, more like duplicating the CPU (which would need a new license). The troublesome part with making the analogy work either way is that the seed duplicated <i>itself</i> as part of its normal functioning, which CPUs don't normally do.<p>Viewed that way, the case has interesting implications for the future patent situation around self-replicating robots.",1361229961

(you might need the help of other people to fix your mistake). After you've fixed the issue the question should be ""how can we make so that this doesn't happen again?"".

I mean it's not that I insist on the bytecode for the sake of having bytecode (I kind of hint at that several times in the last thread, but I guess I could have been more explicit). It's more that I feel that some sort of fundamental change in the way that web applications are built is necessary. Why? I don't think that JS & DOM scripting can be pushed that much further, like I'm having a hard time imagining that say 5-10 years down the line JS applications will be able to compete with native, somewhat computationally heavy applications (which is what I assumed was the direction in which this whole web thing was going). Today, when I open some site which is written as a SPA (e.g. HootSuite) in Chrome, within a couple of minutes, the CPU goes to 100% (on i7). And that is an application that is not really doing anything that computationally expensive. And it's not just HootSuite.<p>So yeah, I don't really care that much about bytecode, and I realize that some change would not happen overnight. Do I have concrete steps how to achieve this?

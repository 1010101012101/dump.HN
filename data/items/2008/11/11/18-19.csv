As in, I meet girls and chat them up in real life before making the judgment call to date them or to continue a relationship with them.<p>And despite having advanced so far, there's a stigma with people using online dating services. Kind of the same with job hiring sites. Let's not forget that a lot of positions in companies are filled through connections and networking rather than applying blindly to job sites.<p>My point is that equating finding employees with finding a girlfriend is odd on so many levels.

It doesn't matter if they pick it up or rebel against it. What matters is getting out of the home to see the world. Travelling around the world (without family) accomplishes the same thing.<p>Staying within the comfort of the home <i>is</i> screwing around ... even if it is ""exploring"" your passions. That's just extending childhood. So what I should have said is that after getting the GED (or equivalent) parents push them out of the nest, whether that results from choosing an apprenticeship for them, or having them travel around the country, or having them take college courses at college campus. That is what the old rites of passages (and the hero myths that go with it) accomplish: force the adolescent out of childhood, just as being born means going from the comfort of the womb to the bright, cold world. And of course, there are some who already know what they want and will already have plans in motion.<p>There is an obstacle with this idea is that many jurisdictions require you to be 16 to take it.

Or, in my cynical view, you want to exploit somebody that's willing to work more for what you're paying them for,hence the ""options"".<p>There's nothing wrong with that kind of behavior, as a business <i>you</i> do have to look for ways to maximize your cash and people like that <i>do</i> exist. The young-gogetters that are extremely talented and looking to work hard to impress and too inexperienced to know their true market value.<p>But the chances of finding someone like that is so rare, and considering other companies pay premium for something like that you would be lucky. And in your process you're going to end up with a lot of submissions from a wide variety of people. That's just how the cookies crumbles.

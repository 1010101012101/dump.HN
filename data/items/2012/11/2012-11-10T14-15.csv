4766776,comment,4766666,4766666,14,0,JangoSteve,,,"Of course it all depends on your actual business, income (i.e. how much time can you <i>afford</i> to spend on internal tools), needs, etc. Since you're talking about client-facing software, I'm going to assume you're in a software development company, which narrows it down a little.<p>For our company, we don't develop internal tools for any given problem until it's a real pain. You'll know when it's an actual pain (as opposed to just an idea), because you'll keep seeing it crop up in your day-to-day work, and if you talk about it with others on your team, they'll say, ""Yeah! I know exactly what you mean, I was thinking about that the other day.""<p>We wait until it's a real pain for a couple reasons:<p>1) We want to make sure we're not wasting our time; we're mostly engineers,  and we all get real, unadulterated enjoyment from building things. It's only too easy for our enjoyment and enthusiasm for building a solution to fool us into thinking there's a problem. But usually, if everyone on the team is instantly excited about the prospect of solving some problem, that's usually a good indicator that it's a real problem.<p>2) The longer we can put off something, the more information we'll have when we go to solve it. In other words, we give ourselves time to figure out first how we <i>want</i> to work, and then find or build tools around that, rather than trying to fit our system to some tool.<p>The second reason is really important too, because when we sit down to really think about every facet of a problem, how it affects our work and how we have been putting up with it and working around it, we'll often realize the best solution isn't some new piece of software; it's merely leveraging some tool we already have slightly differently.<p>For one example, we started losing feedback and updates in email, because some person on the team would get left off the email (e.g. someone hit ""reply"" instead of ""reply-all""), and we wouldn't realize it until some task went un-resolved for several days. We could have built or implemented some sort of support desk system and made it the clients' responsibility to make sure tickets are submitted and then integrated it with email. Or, we could just create a unique email alias for each client, which copies everyone involved. The latter took 2 minutes and improved communication threefold.<p>If you keep growing, you'll eventually reach a point where anything less than a full-blown software solution just isn't going to cut it. But by that time, you've seen how the team deals with the problem over time, and all the pitfalls of other smaller or less-custom solutions, and you'll be able to build the most awesome solution possible.",1352559544

4766774,comment,4766666,4766666,1,0,wrath,,,"I think before you start automating you business and processes you first need to know if your product will get any traction.  Spending the time on making sure you have the best possible MVP is the most important thing, IMO.  You may be launching a lot of tasks manually and modifying the database directly from the console at first but so be it.  The fact is that creating internal tools is very expensive and only indirectly provides benefits to your product.<p>You'll know when you'll need to build better automation to your product; there won't be enough time to get everything done in a day.<p>That said, there's a downside to following this approach.  When you will need to build automation tools you'll be conflicted with spending your time on automation or on improving your product.  Improving your product directly provides benefits, tools indirectly provides benefits.  It can be sometimes hard to convince yourself or others that you need to spend x% of your time on internal tools.<p>Where I work we're at a point where automation is very important.  As the CTO of the company I constantly have to challenge the CEO and others that spending money on tools will give us  some benefit in long term.  The rule (or high level design pattern) that we are trying to implement is for every module of our product, there is a tool to understand the data better for debugging purposes (e.g. a UI to see what step in the workflow the process is in and/or what errors happened, etc), and if data is generated, there's an API/Service to get the data out easily.",1352559511

They are trained to expect discounts and the people in the purchasing department know a lot more about asking for discounts than they know about software, because that is their specialized role in the organization.

Never charge a higher price. Get the customer first, and then make them want you, not hate you.<p>In regards to the specific example of the 80 question doc, I would've simply replied ""sorry, I'm not experienced enough to answer these, then tell him to wait to hear from another sales manager, then circle back in 3 weeks seeing if he got his questions answered (even though you know he hasn't). He's happier than getting a ""no"", and his boss will wonder why the purchase hasn't happened yet. Delay, delay, delay, and let the customer come back to you. That is the filter.

A bouquet of a dozen roses for $10? They'll buy that. But a regular price bouquet at $40? Nah.

Also, Groupon takes anywhere from 40-60% of the deal, plus a ""credit card processing fee"" that's usually 3-4%.<p>Also, a big mistake (in my experience with Groupon) is that they do not have an API for merchants to use.

If you accept falling asleep once, of course it will become a pattern.<p>My experience with people with difficult majors from top schools is they are workaholics if you pay them good money and give them real projects.  If you hire a lacrosse playing English major from an ivy league, and pay substandard wages, don&#x27;t expect to get the cream of the crop.",1379973594

He was disgustingly smart and capable, and applied for over 100 tenure track positions before getting one. He also had an educational pedigree and publication record most of us can only dream of, and was a great guy to boot. If it takes someone like that 100+ applications what chance do the rest of us have!?<p>Because of this, I&#x27;ve taken on the rather larger responsibility of running the labs computing resources, both hardware/software. It&#x27;s a lot of work (I&#x27;d estimate I spend maybe 20 hours a week doing sysadmin related tasks) but it does also give me a totally inappropriate level of responsibility which I hope will be valuable either inside academia, or in industry.

After some years of laughs I just felt awkward because there was this, incredibly unlucky, with no particular skill socially or professionally, mistreated by everybody, from his ex-wife to his brother&#x27;s maid, humiliated by women, with no will-power to fight back. Really, it was just sad. Usually even the weak characters have some quality, some strenght you have to admire in them - as a pure heart. They stripped Allan from all that.<p>But I guess other people started feeling the same way because they change it a little bit. They gave him a beautiful, nice girlfriend, some qualities, some character, some opinion. As a result it is a more human character now, not a freak show.<p>And about BBT, I guess the writers give the characters some of these qualities, so I don&#x27;t feel as awkward whatching it as I was watching 2&1/2Men.",1379973471

The tenure system of the job protections for the past 200+ years of the Western higher education system is based on the low supply of advanced degree holders, which is just the opposite to today&#x27;s situation. There are a lot of very good tenured professors doing amazing academic works and teachings even at their old ages. But I believe everyone knows one or two such tenured professors just doing sloppy works or not publishing for a long while. You want to complaint about those kind of professors? Try ratemyprofessor or FB and that would be it. The only winners of such university tenure system are the tenure holders who view their professorships as entitlements, rather than try to advance the human knowledge or educate the next generation.

6434150,comment,6426055,6426055,1,0,timita,,,"Hi anish_t,<p>About six months ago I tested Kinvey (a BaaS) for an application that makes heavy use of data. Basically you upload your data (say, from CSV) and then you access it via API calls.<p>It looks like you can download your data at any time, say if you need to switch providers. I don&#x27;t have any experience of other providers, but with Kinvey it doesn&#x27;t look like there is a risk of vendor lock-in. It&#x27;s data on the wire via AJAX requests. If things turn to be expensive when you grow up, you move the data to your own backend.<p>That said, I must add that I never ended up using them. The reason - I just needed something with serious geospatial capabilities. I mean PostgreSQL + PostGIS kind of thing.<p>There is also the DIY route, which is not necessarily the best, since it will prolong the time until you release a MVP. But, if you have the manpower to work on it, maybe Drupal is a good alternative for you. It can be set up as a backend, it is secure, and it&#x27;s free. I think you can even set it up as a SPARQL endpoint.<p>Good luck with your startup! I don&#x27;t wish you to reach millions of users, but instead to make millions of dollars :)",1379970279
6434149,comment,6433458,6433458,8,0,cperciva,,,"<i>Payscale subtracts the median wage of a high school graduate...</i><p>This is a common mistake, and one which completely invalidates the process.  The median high school graduate is someone who wasn&#x27;t able to get into college, and many of the factors associated with that -- starting with low high school grades -- are also associated with lower earnings.  You might as well say that purring results in pets gaining legs, because pets which purr have on average more legs than pets which don&#x27;t purr.<p>To get any accurate measure of the value of going to college, you need to compare students who are <i>similar in all ways except college attendance</i>.  Of course, this is a difficult thing to do, since it involves looking at high school grades, SAT scores, parental income, parental education, and gender at a minimum -- all of these factors are known to correlate with both individual educational achievement and individual earnings.",1379970278

3509544,comment,3506769,3507177,2,0,hrktb,,,"Totally agree, and this whole thread allowed me to understand very clearly my gripes about the evolution of google search.<p>I use search at home, when going out, at home, everywhere. And in every different context I have very different expectations. Precisely sharp results for anything in my domain of expertise, blurry and ""good enough"" results for generic searches, multilingual results for broadly relevant searches, very local results for everyday related searches.\nAnd these expectations might change depending on any random factor.<p>I don't think google can weasel out what I want in what context. And I don't feel like adjusting dozens of options everytime I do a different kind of search.<p>Before google started making search smarter, the burden was on my shoulder to do the work to get relevant results for my queries. Now that the algorithms do more and more assumptions, I get to fight with it more and more, and before the blame lies on my search skills, it goes to google for making it hard.<p>My solution was to use separate engines (including multiple instance of the same ones, like ncr, US only, jp only etc), but a fast a dumb engine is really the way to go.",1327496282

Even if the expression is identical if no copying took place then there is no infringement.<p>That said. Copyright also expires which is what you, bane, have failed to mention. Also, copying the style - in this particular case - would have been something along the lines of a yellow cab on the brooklyn bridge with the background in monochrome. Even it seems if they'd had a red bus on Tower Bridge or elsewhere. But here they've used the same style and very nearly the same content. So I don't think you're being quite fair.<p>An analogue might be recreating Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans with the cans marginally rotated, basing the piece on the original work (trademark issues aside). Now I'd like to say that I think that piece actually would be a valid new work - and have quite a lot of substance - but nonetheless it would be derivative of the original beyond mere inspiration IMO.<p>Before I get any further I'd better read the ruling ...",1327495980
3509535,comment,3506953,3508515,1,0,repsilat,,,"> stock is partial ownership<p>This is a nice idea, but it's not immediately obvious it should mean anything. If someone owns 1% of a company they may theoretically own 1% of its assets, but if they can't practically make use of those assets for personal benefit then that value evaporates.<p>Say I'm the director of a company. I own all of its shares and am the one-member board. As chairman of the board I appoint the CEO (myself) and in tandem with said CEO I make all decisions regarding hiring and pay. My company pays no dividends, and I've made it clear that I will never sell more than 49% of the company.<p>Now, the 49% that I might sell technically confers partial ownership, but it gives no control, no dividends, no benefit of any kind.<p>Say my company only does one thing: It invests in Company2, my other business. Company2 is run in exactly the same way as the first company of mine. Now, say I was willing to sell you 49% of the first company, and my first company (me) was also willing to sell you 49% of Company2. You'd own nearly 75% of Company2, but you'd have no control over anything.<p>I could keep nesting companies inside other companies until you effectively owned 99.9% of the company that did the actual work, but that's completely irrelevant - even if the company was worth billions, there is no logical reason that the value of those shares should be correlated with the value of the company. They might as well be correlated with the weight of the CEO, though they should probably be worth nothing at all.<p>I'm pretty sure partial ownership is only worth anything when it is relevant to a credible possibility of controlling ownership.",1327495977

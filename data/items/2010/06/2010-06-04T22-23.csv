When people share ""their opinions on whether it was a good idea to create a Dilbert movie"" there's a fair number of assumptions tied up in there.  It sounds the same as the question ""Can Hollywood make a successful movie out of the characters created by Scott Adams?"" Could the Hollywood studio system of the 1950's have made Easy Rider?  No, of course not.  Adams makes some interesting and fairly uncontroversial points about execution, but seems to do so on the back of a misunderstanding.

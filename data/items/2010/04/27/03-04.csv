I see PowerPoint as a quite unconstrained way to present an series of arbitrary images, paired with an image editor that's evidently more usable than anything else business- and military-types can get their hand on. Perhaps it's the tradition surrounding slide presentations, and not the software used, that permits speakers to be inarticulate and longwinded.",1272338028

I was smart, fat, unapologetically nerdy, and never paid a social price (I had friends, girlfriends in high school, and was not socially maladjusted other than a stubborn anti-authority streak that remains with me). Seemingly I also had higher confidence and was more physically oriented than many geeks I have met later in life.<p>I'm wondering what the differences were. I know one is that I went to high school in a highly educated town where geeks and jocks were nearly equally respected. That can't be the whole story, however, because I also had some friends who happened to be the less socially able geeks, and I experienced a similar degree of friendship and acceptance in junior high, which was in a decidedly less intellectual-friendly city.<p>I'm sorry if I seem to be going on, but I want to provide a counterpoint to the picked-on geek, and I'm curious why the bullied geek is such a common stereotype (seems to be a true stereotype; I don't argue otherwise).",1272337592

I just want to point out that yes, node.js through CGI is a massive bastardisation.<p>The main reason for it was that I (and possibly some other people) want to make websites using JavaScript and then just chuck it on some cheap shared server. The reason specifically for node.js is because it's arguably the most popular form of server-side JavaScript.<p>Yes, CGI spawns a new process for each request but V8 (the node.js VM) is crazy-insane fast. I haven't done any tests but my intuition (which is quite probably wrong) tells me that the cost of forking V8 (lightweight) is probably not as bad having a Python process ready and serving from it.<p>By the time my blog receives enough requests that having a persistant process is necessary, I would have moved on to caching. Caching is <i>the</i> answer for blogs.<p>Running node.js via CGI for a complex web application is definitely not the final answer. I've made the libary very similar to the built-in event based HTTP server so the cost of switching when the application gets too big is very insignificant.

147955,comment,147710,147938,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Well, you'd have to remap all the sensory inputs (computers don't have that problem since they have standard interfaces).  For instance, if you got put in a smaller body you'd keep reaching for things and coming up short; you'd have a different sense of balance; speech would be hard since mouth and vocal cords would be different shape and quality; lots of things like this.  The brain is extremely adaptable and could theoretically learn to do this (esp with something like rehabilitation therapy), but trying to do it all at once would be a tall order.<p>Basically instead of a computer's fixed API, you are continually negotiating a new interface between brain, body, and world with every action you take.  Keeping it updated isn't hard but starting from scratch takes lots of trial and error (just watch a baby grow and you'll see what I mean).",1206644209

147949,comment,147880,147880,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Sounds like a reasonable question, with a perfectly logical explanation.  A reasonable (if misguided) question.<p>Huge companies with huge success are <i>very uncommon</i> - that's why we can list them off the top of our heads.  YC invests in a lot of companies, but not many in terms of the total number of startups in the world.  So lets say that out of 10,000 startups, 1 gets huge (Google, Facebook, etc), 9 get big (Digg-sized).  That's 1 in 1000.  YC has invested in ~80 startups (call it 100 for easy math sake), which is 1% of the ""market"".  100 tries at 1 in 10,000 isn't great.  Even if you say that YC companies are 10x more likely to succeed (not unreasonable given the training, motivation, selection bias, etc), 100 shots at 1 in 1,000 still isn't that good.<p>Becoming huge requires a lot of things - including luck and timing.  No matter how much value YC adds, it can't add those two things.  What it can do is increase 1) the odds of success and 2) the expected value of that success (0.1% chance of $1B, 99.9% chance of $0 isn't very appealing).<p>I think pg's goal isn't to create billionaires (although he wouldn't mind).  His goal is to help smart hackers solve ""the money problem"" so they can have the freedom to pursue other productive pursuits they wish.  Look at what he, rtm, and tlb have done since they sold Viaweb (Arc, YC, HN, Harvard prof, awesome homemade robots).  None of that would have been done if they were working at Google for $110K/yr.<p>Trying to solve ""the money problem"" in a couple years shows an <i>excess</i> of ambition, especially since programmers earn decent coin in the corporate world.",1206643770

Can your team (no quotes) do it, and do it well?<p>Who cares if you are a brilliant programmer... Can you deliver what is required, or are you going to build a gold-plated, incomplete product?  That's what execute means, and it's really freekin hard to get that into people's minds: Get it done, do it good enough, don't do it perfect.  Perfect ain't for startups, it's for time-wasting hobbyists.<p>As for the MBA or whatever big university name or title or whatever:  It doesn't matter squat.  ""Harvard"" on your resume might get people's attention, but ultimately what matters is ""can this person execute?""  I have seen some brilliant people without an education do extremely well...  And I have seen collossal failures out of people that look like the top 0.1% on paper.<p>It all boils down to execution: Getting it done.  Can this guy prioritize correctly?

As long as nothing else about your message is stupid (e.g. RFC compliant SMTP server, reasonable DNS records, and you aren't sending 100 per minute to addresses in the same domain), it'll go through.<p>I'd suggest using whatever Python library will allow you to send using a real SMTP server (or just pipe your email into the mail or sendmail command, which use the local smtpd to send, by default), like Postfix or Sendmail.  There may be a standalone library that is actually RFC compliant and handles error conditions properly, but it seems unlikely from a historical standpoint (most such libraries, particularly in the PHP world, are renowned for epic failure).  As long as Postfix or Sendmail are configured properly, your mail will be RFC-compliant and will look far less spammy than those coming from a half-assed implementation of the spec.",1206642395

From the outside looking in, it feels like investors would much rather fund entrepreneurs with previous successes or an existing hot product.

Intelligence that is synthesized outside of natural processes (I think the term ""AI"" is paradoxical when describing super-human intelligence) will require means of interacting with the environment in the same way we require our bodies.<p>It would be evolutionarily advantageous for a superhuman intelligence to devise better ways of grasping/flying/swimming in order to expand upon the existing knowledge base that it would acquire.  Also from the perspective of experienced-based knowledge having a ""body"" would be invaluable.<p>In other words, reading books and doing thought experiments do not contribute to our intelligence as much as these things <i>in combination</i> with experimentation and interaction with our real world through what our bodies can manifest.

I had to compare my wage to lots of people who got hired 2-3 years earlier (which could have been me, of course, if I hadn&#x27;t pursued an extra degree).<p>Not starting work in 1998, I&#x27;ve calculated, cost me me somewhere north of $250k in wages (over three years, this is Europe I&#x27;m talking about). It would have been exhausting but the company that hired me in 2000 would have hired me in 1998 and allowed me to work on my thesis on the side, and of course $250k would easily pay for a year&#x27;s sabbatical afterward. Even better scenario would have been work until 2001, get fired with severance (usually not optional in Europe), then finish degree, miss the worst of the downturn.<p>Very frustrating to work among people who make double or triple you do just because of the time they were hired (this was a consultancy firm, more than relatively basic development skills were not required, or usually not even wanted). Very frustrating to come to the realization I finished my education at pretty much the worst time in 2 decades, and just how big the difference was with a more optimal choice of when to study.<p>Oh well, maybe the people in this thread are right, and I&#x27;ll get the chance to get another (related) degree.

But I did not think so much about hardware costs when I said that it is probably underestimated but because I picked the efficiency from the top of the range and energy costs from the bottom.<p>And it does not necessarily break anything but the security of Bitcoin is build on the assumption that it is very hard for any single entity to posses the majority of the hash rate. If you take the 100 million Dollars of hardware, reducing the hash rate tenfold will make the network attackable with only 10 million Dollars which seems pretty cheap to me. And being vulnerable does not imply the attack is actually executed, it only means it could happen anytime. But do you want your money in a system that could be attack anytime?",1419256335

(If we accept its premises that without the information the bitcoin cannot be stolen - this is not true due to 50% attack and other reasons.  Gold cannot physically disappear but bitcoin can logically disappear by network consensus or a new version of the bitcoin network that no longer accepts it and which people adopt for some reason.  This was done early in bitcoin&#x27;s history.)<p>But if we accept the premise, then anyone physically close enough to take a picture (let&#x27;s wrap the gold bar in a dust cover, so that this entails unwrapping it) can physically steal it.  i.e. if you prevent someone from physically stealing it, such as keeping it in a vault, then to a good approximation you&#x27;ve also prevented them from unwrapping its dust cover and reading the engraving.<p>I guess exceptions would be if you have workers who work in your vault but go through metal detectors to make sure they haven&#x27;t stolen the gold, or the gold is somehow physically too heavy to move in one piece quickly, or somehow you can react to it being stolen and prevent the gold from actually leaving, but not if it remains in the vault.

If you reduce the hash rate and therefore the operation costs tenfold you end up with a 25 PHash/s network on the one hand and unused hardware worth 225 PHash/s on the other hand. Significantly reducing the network hash rate without getting vulnerable seems a pretty hard problem to me.<p>I did not make the numbers up - hash rate and transaction volume [1], mining efficiencies [2] and energy costs [3].

The reason why you may want to use one is the same as the reason why you&#x27;d want to use a higher level language rather than assembly. Instead of repeating the same pattern to implement every rule in the grammar you simply write down the grammar and the parser generator expands that so that you don&#x27;t have to. Unfortunately most parser generators are limited in the class of languages they parse, or they are limited in the languages that they can express conveniently. Even parser generators that support full context free grammars are not enough. You need some method to abstract common patterns. For example if you want to express operator parsing in a context free grammar you end up with a separate rule for each level of precedence. Parser combinator libraries do allow you to use the full abstraction facilities of the programming language, but they usually are weak in terms of which grammars they allow you to parse in polynomial time (usually LL), whereas ideally you would be able to parse regular languages in O(n), deterministic languages in O(n) and context free languages in O(n^3). Also parser combinators often do not support streaming & incrementality because their reliance on backtracking forces them to keep the entire input in memory.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any parser generator or parser combinator library that simultaneously supports abstraction and supports efficient streaming parsing.

- where in location you were
- what kind of employer you had<p>Far and away the hardest hit during the last crash were new-grads who had accepted job offers that hadn&#x27;t actually started yet.  Those jobs immediately went away and there was nothing to replace them with.  I know of lots of people who left tech in general after this, and others who constitute a &quot;lost&quot; generation that has always made less money/done less interesting things because of this.  Everyone up the experience ladder did better in an almost exponential way.  That is, junior devs either spent a lot of time unemployed or accepted jobs at salaries well below what they were expecting.  More experienced devs ended up hunkering down in &quot;boring&quot; jobs and saw their wages stagnate for a few years etc.<p>SV and the west coast in general got hit much harder than the rest of the country.  NYC, Chicago, Texas, Minneapolis, Atl, etc had down cycles but their diversified employer base meant that it was muted by comparison.<p>Besides the obvious dying of unsustainable startups and their employees, the people in tech. services were much more impacted than other industries.  Particularly hard hit, were body shops and the big consultancies.  Finance, insurance, pharma, etc all took much less of a hit.<p>I&#x27;d add that along with the dot com bubble, several other factors added in to make the last crash particularly brutal.  Lots of enterprises used the 2000 bug scare as an excuse to retool and there was tons of work that went away after that ramped down.  Then 9/11 came along and put a major hit on companies willingness to spend on infrastructure.<p>As far as being &quot;well-insulated&quot;, there isn&#x27;t much advice to give.  These are macro factor trends that impact everyone.  The advice for this is the same as for dealing with any risk.

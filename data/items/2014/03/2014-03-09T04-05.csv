Maybe it was outlandish, wouldn&#x27;t work because of things he hadn&#x27;t considered, etc. etc.  If he uses each of these experience to further hone his idea generation, he can look at each proposal of one of his ideas as an opportunity to get further down the track to the right idea.<p>I think a big part of that is in HOW he proposes the ideas. Rather than jumping in whole heartedly with &quot;this is how xyz should be done&quot;, he could come at it with &quot;I was thinking about the way we do xyz, and maybe it would be better if we did it by abc...&quot; then he gets the feedback and gets to hone the idea.<p>I fondly remember why my favorite mentor became my favorite.

(And ideally tldrlegal.com should have a standard URL to reach the one-and-only license corresponding to a given SPDX identifier.)<p>- I&#x27;d love to see standardized tags for OSI-compliant Open Source licenses, GNU-approved Free Software licenses, GPLv2-compatible licenses, and GPLv3-compatible licenses.

7367454,comment,7367027,7367027,4,0,anjbe,,,"I have to take issue with TldrLegal’s summary of the ISC license: <a href=""https://tldrlegal.com/license/-isc-license"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tldrlegal.com/license/-isc-license</a><p>It starts out with, “The ISC license is not very well regarded because it has an “and/or” wording that makes it (debatably) legally vague.” Um, really? There is only one person who thinks that: rms. The ISC license isn’t the most popular permissive license, but it is reasonably common, being used by several large organizations (like, well, the ISC), and of course by a number of people for personal projects.<p>So aside from it not being copyleft, why _does_ rms (and thus the FSF licenses page) dislike the ISC license? Well, the ISC and Pine licenses both contain the following wording:<p>“Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software… is hereby granted…”<p>University of Washington apparently tried to claim that this disallowed distribution of modified versions of Pine. Of course, that interpretation is completely ridiculous, as evidenced by 1) the reaction on debian-legal <a href=""https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2002/11/msg00138.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2002/11/msg00138.html</a> and 2) the large number of people who use the license to this day.<p>But because _one_ copyright holder interpreted those words in a way that nobody else does, the FSF has claimed ever since that any license using such wording is dangerous (not nonfree, just dangerous). Which is silly. Anyone can misinterpret a license—I have seen several people release code under the GPL and then try to claim that prevents commercial redistribution. Would the FSF list that as a reason not to use the GPL? Of course not.<p>Anyway, the thing that bothered me the most about the TldrLegal entry was the statement that it’s “not very well regarded.” More accurate would be to say “not well regarded _by the FSF_”, but even that wouldn’t paint the whole picture because it doesn’t account for organizations like OpenBSD or ISC who actively prefer it.<p>By the way, here’s some interesting reading from Paul Vixie about the history of the ISC license: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.protocols.dns.bind/D8VLXloVfxc/4yweyAjRCecJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.protocols.dns.bin...</a> In response to the noise made by the FSF, the ISC changed the “and” to “and/or,” though of course that didn’t change the FSF’s mind at all. OpenBSD still uses the “and” wording.",1394340035

Many people addressed the first point (e.g. Why git is totally fine), so I&#x27;ll focus on the second one: code reviews with Git. Pull requests is one of many ways to do it, which I personally find difficult with bigger teams working on non open-source projects. I&#x27;d recommend looking at Phabricator as a code review tool that works really well in teams.",1410076559

8280554,comment,8266767,8266767,1,0,dorfuss,,,"My situation is somewhat different as I have never been a programmer per se, I graduaded in cultural anthropology, worked for two years at an insurance corporation and now for almost a year at a small software developer, implementing a BPM system which consist of both some coding and meeting with clients.<p>I also started studying computer science a year ago. What has crushed my ambition was the math. It simply requires lots and lots of time to start solving basic problems at  advenced level. Even if I pushed hard, sleep less, the reality is that I&#x27;d never get to the level where my math is useful in CS, or compete with people who are talented with math. And none of my colleagues do any sort of calculations. There is no optimalization effort. Deadlines are short and we just have to get things done. The chief architect even says &quot;memory is cheaper than processing time&quot; so we shuffle around big chunks of data instead of making smarter algorhytms. It of course doesn&#x27;t mean that math isn&#x27;t important - I admire anyone who has mastered linear algebra.<p>So I realised that it wouldn&#x27;t be worthwile to struggle with math, which was too hard, but rather try to learn new languages, build something useful etc.<p>And than I realised that sitting at a computer the entire day is not what I wanted for myself. When I was young I dreamt of becoming a filmmaker, make documentaries. A friend helped me to dug this old dream out of my subconsciousness.<p>He told me to write down and read a list of my strong sides every evening and add to it if I find something new. And so I have for over 120 days. And I focused on what I would like to accomplish and how much I want to sacrifice to achieve my dreams. So the plan is to try to get to Manchester University and study Visual Anthropology for a year and move on with a filmmaking career. Wish me luck",1410076406

Just that by reading the encounter, I feel sorry for the cards they&#x27;ve been dealt with, so to say:<p>1) a s/w hang for which there was no way to advance in a getting a solid RCA. This alone is a very hard one, and I know the ugly feeling both from the customer&#x27;s side and from the vendor&#x27;s side when all you have as an action plan is to try to reduce the potential exposure to what you think the problem is. I&#x27;ve been there myself multiple times, both as a customer, and as a vendor support.<p>2) Bridge loops. You can fix an active loop by disconnecting links, but root-causing such a problem is not a piece of cake, by far.<p>3) A buggy client firmware.

That would be just barely enough to support all of CSAIL&quot;. The network gear frequently allows to re-carve the TCAM space - maybe they might have taken some space from IPv4 which is by default is provisioned much more generously (for various reasons outside the scope for this thread).<p>Besides just brute-forcing, there might be other strategies in dealing with the temporary addresses - actually shortening the valid lifetime and bringing it closer to the preferred lifetime should work. This gives me some useful material to update my IPv6 troubleshooting talk with.<p>There are other scenarios in other setups that one can go out of TCAM, see e.g. <a href=""http://lists.cluenet.de/pipermail/ipv6-ops/2013-October/009416.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.cluenet.de/pipermail/ipv6-ops/2013-October/0094...</a><p>So, no, MIT folks are by far not stupid - it&#x27;s the problem that is complicated - and, after staying up for 40 hours, whatever helps to reduce the pain is good.<p>But I&#x27;m confident there&#x27;s more learning here to be done from this unfortunate incident.",1410076272

Remember that Ek grows with the square of speed, so you need 4.5g of 747 for each gram of Concorde, something you only get when closing in on a 747 at MTOW (400t for a -400, 440t for a -8i) and a completely empty Concorde (80t).<p>Comparing the 747-400 and Concorde using maximum takeoff weights, the 747 comes out at 15GJ[0] when Concorde is 33GJ[1]. Using empty weight has roughly the same ratio. Even swapping the -400 for a -8i yields only marginal improvements to 17GJ[2].<p>With a loaded but dry plane (simulating the arrival at the end of a flight, under the assumption that fuel is a much bigger part of a Concorde than a 747) and maximum fuel load at takeoff, Concorde comes out at 16GJ[3] and the 8i at 10GJ[4].<p>Even if we use the same route, halve the 8i&#x27;s fuel load (to account for twice the range) and replace it all with additional payload (which I&#x27;m not sure makes any sense), it&#x27;s still only 13GJ.<p>Going back to the first paragraph, fully loaded 747&#x27;s 15~17GJ[0][2] would indeed beat a completely empty Concorde&#x27;s 14GJ[5], but that&#x27;s about it.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+396890+kg+*+%28988+km%2Fh%29%5E2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+396890+kg+*+%28...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+185000+kg+*+%282158+km%2Fh%29%5E2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+185000+kg+*+%28...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+442253+kg+*+%28988+km%2Fh%29%5E2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+442253+kg+*+%28...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+%28185000+-+95680%29+kg+*+%282158+km%2Fh%29%5E2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+%28185000+-+956...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+%28442253+-+216840+*+0.81%29+kg+*+%28988+km%2Fh%29%5E2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+%28442253+-+216...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+78700+kg+*+%282158+km%2Fh%29%5E2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+*+78700+kg+*+%282...</a>",1410075412

I expected transphobia plus sexism in the office, I got less of the former and far more blatant examples of the latter.  I transitioned in the same job, reporting to the same people and supervising the same people and my treatment changed hugely:<p>â€¢ Guys I&#x27;d taught to use network tools months earlier (ngrep, paratrace, etc.) were eager to teach me to use the same tools and suddenly started giving me less credence.<p>â€¢ People in meetings (especially men) presumed I was from marketing or sales even when I was introduced as tech lead.<p>â€¢ When members of another group needed access to code I&#x27;d written my boss pointed them at me and told them I&#x27;d written it - so they came to ask me who knew the code and could explain it.  I spent north of 10 min trying to get through to some very sincere, confused devs that no, there wasn&#x27;t a &quot;guy who wrote the code&quot; that I was hiding from them and I was the only person who could help them.<p>â€¢ In meetings a male dev who reported to me started getting all the questions and was expected to sign off on things.  When I made the final call on something people would ask him his decision.<p>â€¢ I lost two to three feet of personal space in elevators, break room conversations, and hallway discussions with management types and got talked over much more.<p>â€¢ I was happy that the invitations (I refused once I knew what I was in for) to beer runs/golf/bars with scantily clad servers stopped, but so did the &quot;male execs go out in cliques&quot; lunches.  There&#x27;s a lot of social currency, inside information, politics and gossip when guys go out like that and <i>poof</i>, your access is gone (or you never had it if you&#x27;re a cis woman).<p>â€¢ Upper management stopped defaulting to believing me about deadlines, security issues, redundancy, etc.  My concerns were far more likely to be considered overrated.<p>Every single one of these things I noticed _and_ had others mention to me.  Imagine the combined effect of 10 years of that on someone&#x27;s career and you&#x27;ll understand why so few women have made it up the ranks in tech companies..",1410074345

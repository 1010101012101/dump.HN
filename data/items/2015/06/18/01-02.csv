The current producer of Borland&#x27;s Delphi, Embarcadero, sell the product for a minimum of $1000 plus a subscription is now required to get ANY bug fixes at all! Accessing a client/server database is a $500 add-on (or upgrade to the $2000 package), etc. Delphi Professional + c/s add-on plus subscription runs about $2147 the last time I checked!<p>Who in 2015 pays $2,147 to be able to develop software? Note that you&#x27;ll need to spend even more to target mobile and there&#x27;s no Linux solution yet either.<p>Delphi users refuse to accept it (or that mobile or web are here to stay, or that there are better VCS systems than subversion, which is the only VCS that Delphi&#x27;s IDE fully supports) but the days of the expensive, proprietary IDE are indeed dead.

I think this is wrong on both counts.<p>The <i>reason</i> so many people here believe something I find obviously wrong is because of basic technofetishism. We love &quot;science&quot;. We love exotic technology. And we want to believe exotic technology can make the world better, because it so often has.

Here, your models monitor and react to trading tick-by-tick, and execution speed is paramount. It‚Äôs also where you have the fiercest arms race for the fastest systems, colocation, FPGAs, etc. Next up comes what‚Äôs often called ‚Äústatistical arbitrage,‚Äù where you have models that no longer look at tick-by-tick trading but may look at what happens at 30-second, 1-minute, or 5-minute windows. Here you have more interesting relations emerge between stocks and the market, e.g., what does IBM do relative to the tech index, or relative to MSFT, etc. (Such cross sectional relationships don‚Äôt seem to matter as much in HFT.) Actually stat-arb was the domain where the earliest statistical approaches such as &quot;pairs trading&quot; emerged. Next up come models that trade daily (or less frequently), and here you begin to see the long-short market-neutral relative-value type of approaches, where some quantitative [mutual] funds may operate. Next up will be the traditional mutual funds, and beyond that you have your Warren Buffett‚Äôs, etc.<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the higher your trading frequency, the smaller the price moves you can hope to capture, which limits how much capital you can deploy in your models. This is why HFT models are usually small in size but have high Sharpe ratios. As you reduce your trading frequency, you can expect to capture larger price movements and deploy more capital but you‚Äôll also be exposed to more of the vicissitudes of the general market, so your Sharpe ratio will decline. Market participants usually carve themselves a happy spot on this frequency spectrum and stay there. I don‚Äôt know of any firm who is successful at every spot.",1434592421

Unless you yourself are a crypto expert that&#x27;s qualified to carry out such an audit, and you have the spare time / inclination to perform a full audit of the app, then there&#x27;s no reason why it being open-source should make it any more trustworthy. Perhaps if some independent trustworthy third party performed the audit you could then decide to trust it, but closed-source apps can still be audited, it just requires the help of the app developer to do so.<p>And of course even if the app is audited (whether open- or closed-source), that audit will only really verify the particular version that was audited. Future changes may introduce vulnerabilities again, so unless someone qualified to do so is constantly auditing all future changes, then you can&#x27;t really trust it anymore, since your trust model is that the source needs to be independently verified to be trusted.<p>On other hand, if your trust model is that you determine whether you trust the <i>people</i> involved to get it right, then it doesn&#x27;t matter if the app is open- or closed-source, as long as it&#x27;s developed by the right people. Granted, it can be hard to determine whether someone can be trusted to get it right without independent audits, but speaking personally, I take tptacek&#x27;s &quot;I feel like they know what they&#x27;re doing&quot; recommendation as carrying a fair amount of weight. I certainly would welcome an independent audit of 1Password, but I recognize that I can&#x27;t really expect a closed-source software vendor to hand the source of their flagship application to a 3rd party.<p>(if it isn&#x27;t clear, I&#x27;m a happy user of 1Password)",1434591051

9736214,comment,9735358,9735638,0,0,carussell,,,"I took a serious look at MINIX over the winter, and digested several of Tanenbaum&#x27;s talks around that time.  (For anyone wondering if this talk contains anything substantially different from past ones, the answer is no.)<p>Here are some things to add:<p>- Nowadays x86 is built with LLVM by default, and ARM is using GCC.<p>- X11 is mentioned in the video, but the 3.3.0 release from last fall didn&#x27;t ship with a working X server, although past releases have.  There is a message on the mailing list from someone who writes that they&#x27;ve got it working on a subsequent snapshot release.<p>- You may have heard something in the past about 10 minute build times.  That info is out of date as of the switch to NetBSD userspace for 3.3.0.  MINIX itself (i.e., all the interesting parts) still only takes about 10-15 minutes to build, but there&#x27;s no way to just slurp down the sources for its kernel/drivers/servers to build a MINIX &quot;core&quot; and then supplement it with the prebuilt binaries for userspace (at least, not without doing some significant work on your end to allow for that).  The initial build for x86 on my modest machine takes about 3 hours, almost all of it spent building LLVM twice.<p>- For anyone looking for serious collaborators, MINIX is seriously lacking in infrastructure from a project/community standpoint.  E.g., a fair bit of documentation is missing and much of what you will find on the wiki is out of date.  Development processes are neither documented nor easily discoverable because there are effectively no development processes in place.  Until about six months or so ago, MINIX was without a bugtracker.  Organizationally/project-wise, the whole thing is pretty sparse.<p>- If you have watched previous talks on MINIX, e.g. FOSDEM 2010, you will be familiar with the open calls for those interested in working for pay, using the money from the two grants mentioned in this video.  That money is now gone.  During that time, MINIX was basically a research project run by grad students who were working ~full time on MINIX, with the funding from those grants.  It&#x27;s the same now as far as the student-run aspect goes, but with drastically fewer contributions.  Not much of the paid man hours seem to have gone towards scaffolding out project infrastructure as I mentioned before, or the sorts of drudge work that volunteers are unlikely to take up.<p>- The code quality is... I dunno, fair?  As I mentioned before, there are/were effectively no development processes in place; no code review, etc.  So there&#x27;s a fair bit of nastiness that got checked in directly, like copy and paste, especially among the arch-specific boot time stuff; the comments are fairly sparse; and you can find dead code and references to routines/fields that either no longer exist or have been renamed, even in the relatively short (~500 line) main.c.<p>For anyone looking in to maybe starting to work with MINIX, I&#x27;d suggest assessing whether or not you would be comfortable striking out and doing things on your own, and then being prepared to do so.  With MINIX, you aren&#x27;t going to find a thriving community that you can just add your piece to, so as to contribute to the effort.  You might run into a certain level of that sort of old-guard, paralyzing stop energy, so in a way it&#x27;s got a lot of the downsides of a greenfield project except with few, if any, of the upsides.",1434589918

You could argue that it&#x27;s up to the student to make attempts before reading on, but that rarely works.<p>The other extreme is the link in the OP, that is minimal in assistance.

I own one of these in real life universe. It runs linux, which is awesome, because that means that I can SSH into it. It runs an  apache server in my home. It can download from usenet or torrents. I can control it via SSH instead of using the remote control.[0]<p>In this alternative universe, WDLX going to use Hurd instead of linux, because for this small device it will certainly have better performance on their underpowered MIPS chip. And they&#x27;re not going to ship anything besides what they have to, becasue this is a small embedded computer.<p>What happens to that homebrew community when they ship a microkernel with proprietary servers for everything, and nothing else? It&#x27;s going to be profoundly difficult to develop on this. You might already see this if you own a chromebook or a WDTV-- missing kernel modules means that you simply can&#x27;t do anything without compiling your kernel. Couple this with secureboot and you&#x27;re locked in.<p>I&#x27;m no expert on these things, most of this is based on brief research from years ago. If you think that I&#x27;m wrong, please tell me why, I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong. But for the time being, I believe widespread implementations of microkernels would be very anti-general-purpose computing.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://wdlxtv.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wdlxtv.com/</a>",1434589608

People get frustrated when they don&#x27;t hear anything and email again which appears to add to the problem. The issue with subject being changed can be solved, or at least significantly reduced, fairly easily by using a trouble ticket system that automatically adds a ticket number. The update seems to confirm your initial assumption that whatever system they are currently using is simply not working for the size of their company and the number of requests they are receiving.

A faster sequence of code won&#x27;t be anymore if, upon exiting it, something <i>else</i> has to stall due to a cache miss. Pushing the function to the next alignment boundary might move the one <i>after</i> it as well, causing a cascade effect.

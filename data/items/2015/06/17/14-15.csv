9732181,comment,9731223,9731838,0,0,rayiner,,,"First, taxis are not a &quot;cartel.&quot; Cartels are characterized by an agreement among participants not to compete with each other. In contrast, taxis are a government-granted monopoly, like your power company or water company. Those monopolies were granted for much the same reason as they were granted to your power or water company: taxis serve as a quasi-public extension of a city&#x27;s transit infrastructure and cities use the monopoly grant as a carrot to extract concessions from private cab companies (i.e. no surge pricing, commercial insurance, servicing all parts of a city, etc).<p>Second, the economic arguments in favor of taxi regulation are stronger when you&#x27;re talking about street hails.[1] The market is inefficient because customers do not really have any way of choosing cabs that offer good service. In turn, cabs have little incentive to offer good service. Furthermore, there are safety concerns. It is not uncommon in certain countries for cab drivers to cooperate with muggers and robbers.<p>On the whole, I think the customer service and safety concerns are a lot less compelling in 2015 New York than in 1915 New York, and that you should be able to hail an Uber off the street. But there is a logic to the existing regulations, and Uber&#x27;s arguments against regulation are weakest when applied to street hails, where its reputation system does not come into play.<p>[1] This paper surveys the economic issues in play: <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/economic-analysis-taxicab-regulation/233832.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/ec...</a>.",1434553167

Security (modulo side-channel attacks) is then just a function of each object&#x27;s grammar and corresponding parser implementation.<p>We can then reason about security in terms of formal language theory. For example, an object&#x27;s whose grammar is a regular expression is much more secure than an object with a Turing complete grammar.<p>Of course, if you take the idea of objects too seriously, you then realize that you don&#x27;t need things like operating systems in the first place.",1434552641

My non-lawyer impression is that they all &quot;say&quot; about the same things but get progressively more detailed about it. The most recent one I signed was as part of the Blekko acquisition by IBM. Blekko&#x27;s was pretty strictly boiler plate, IBM&#x27;s has clearly been litigated a few times and the terms stated more clearly. The exact contents are of course confidential (which I find sad because as far as I can tell there isn&#x27;t anything particularly valuable in say Google&#x27;s terms versus Sun&#x27;s terms and comparing them is interesting.)<p>And when I went to Sun my &#x27;disclosures of previous inventions&#x27; was empty, when acquired by IBM it was about a page and a half. Of course if they are going to be somewhat detailed, so am I. So for example I now always mention my web site (which is much neglected of late but has a few ads which make a small amount a money each month), between my Google and Blekko engagements I had a pitched a storage idea to a couple of people, no one has actually built it yet so I keep it on the list, Etc. The sorts of the things you tend to collect over the years. Nobody has ever had any issue with me putting these things on the pre-disclosure list.<p>Generally I&#x27;ve found the much more onerous terms are the requirements for using your personal device to access work resources, they have gotten quite extreme (which I understand, given the security challenges). When the agreements start to reach out to computers or what not that I own and that do not have any connection with my employer I start to get a bit twitchy :-).<p>Bottom line, I think Sun&#x27;s AoI had the same Intention as the ones the OP is talking about but it wasn&#x27;t as verbose about it, and over the years I&#x27;ve noticed more and more verbiage to make it really clear that when you work for company X they really own the things you develop on their time, even if you think you&#x27;re contributing to an open source project as part of your job.

If you are driving for both services but Uber comprises 80% of your volume and Lyft 20%, it&#x27;s an easy decision to make.

(Dead code is an isolated island in this dependency graph.)<p>You want two things out of that graph: less nodes, because less code is simpler, better, cheaper.  And less <i>edges</i>, because understanding, modifying, or troubleshooting a piece of code requires knowing about its dependencies (hopefully, only the direct ones).<p>When the unit of organisation is the function, you kinda state that each function is a node, and the call graph are part of the edges (the call graph would cover everything in a purely functional settings, but side effect produces implicit dependencies).  Trouble is, in any significant system, you&#x27;re gonna have a <i>lot</i> of nodes and edges.  How to make sense of that?<p>That&#x27;s why we have module.  When you look at your dependency graph, you will most certainly note that parts of your graph are denser than others.  Those clusters are the natural modules.  If you formalise that, and draw module boundaries around those clusters, you can now have a two-level view: inside a module, you have a <i>small</i> dependency graph, with a few outbound edges.  Outside, you can visualise a coarser graph of module dependencies.  Again, fewer nodes and edges, because you have grouped them.<p>Now the <i>real</i> benefits of module is, once you start drawing boundaries, you have an incentive to make small interfaces, to minimise inter-module dependencies.  Additionally, visualising the module dependency graph directly helps you spot spooky dependencies that probably shouldn&#x27;t be there.  You can then cut some dependencies out, simplifying your graph in the process.<p>Without modules, I don&#x27;t see how you would manage this kind of scale.

I did, checked and confirmed with the client (jewellery designer where the image quality was important) and they were happy. On my iPad3 the 1.5 product images (at 1200 pixels wide presented half width of screen) were MORE than adequate and very sharp on the iPad. No &quot;blurriness&quot; at all.

But I don&#x27;t disagree with you about using a CDN, it&#x27;s just that a CDN doesn&#x27;t suddenly make the frontend more responsive or snappy.

Works for me, works for them. Whether it works for anyone else is not my problem! I&#x27;m just sharing my approach. Ignore or disagree, it&#x27;s all good.<p>Good luck.

Still you have to identify how the process could be hidden but since it uses known API calls in an uncommon way, I think this is quite doable.<p>The second defense is more complex, changing the way Keychain API works without breaking every app out there is much more complex. Not knowing much about this is implemented it might take a lot of testing to verify a fix without breaking apps.<p>The last thing they can also do is to build a verified system tool that checks the existing keychain for incorrect ACL usage. You can&#x27;t hide the hack from the system. This way Apple could fix the ACL to not allow incorrect usage and not give access where it doesn&#x27;t belong.

There were statements that unpaid overtime was expected, which is also illegal in PA (employees are allowed to work unpaid overtime but it cannot be a requirement for employment).

Most indie and small-studio games we play today were built using one engine or another. The graphics pipeline in Unity, Gamemaker, etc might be heavily optimized but the majority of the game is written in an interpreted or managed language run-time like Lua or C#.<p>You can write 3D simulations with a decent frame-rate in Python. You just need a lot of help with the &quot;hot&quot; spots be calling out to C and C++ libraries for support. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with writing little 3D engines in Cython + Python + SDL2. It does end up taking a load more memory and performance can drop drastically if you&#x27;re not consciously thinking about your data-flow. The trick I&#x27;ve found is to avoid most of the features that make Python great in those critical sections... plain old data structures, weak references, pack your data together and transform it once (ie: avoid copies).<p>However it&#x27;s great for prototyping and toying with new ideas. Python is vastly more forgiving when you don&#x27;t know up-front how you&#x27;re going to structure your data flows.<p>But in the end I just end up going back to C99 at some point anyway.<p>Writing games in Ruby shouldn&#x27;t be weird. It&#x27;s cool.",1434549868

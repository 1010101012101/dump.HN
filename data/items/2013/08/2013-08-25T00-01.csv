It&#x27;s a technical expertise with developing a story/dialogue/scene sequence. The literal story can be shallow and unappealing, but the story&#x27;s visuals, acting, etc. are all highly tuned.<p>I also don&#x27;t agree that &quot;works of art&quot; are what keep Hollywood profitable. You just said most movies are terrible and formulaic. Those are the biggest money makers, unless you call those more artistic than the indie films everybody loves.<p>You go on to compare Hollywood to the typewriter. The typewriter is an extremely poor analogy. It was literally eclipsed by superior technology and made obsolete.<p>You cannot make Hollywood &quot;obsolete&quot; - there is a worship culture to celebrities, a direct product of Hollywood (as the author describes). Hollywood survived the television being put into homes, which would arguably be more of a technology progression. You can&#x27;t just beat a cult of personality with technology is the author&#x27;s point - Silicon Valley isn&#x27;t going to remove something so deeply embedded in America just by getting &quot;smarter&quot; about it. It&#x27;s vastly more complex than that, and it&#x27;s not going away just because a startup comes out with something that attempts to make Hollywood &quot;obsolete.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not saying it can&#x27;t be done, just that your argument doesn&#x27;t work.",1377392371

6270426,comment,6269134,6269913,1,0,pedrocr,,,"You&#x27;re probably thinking of contrast based autofocus, no? The reason I say it&#x27;s been cracked is that there are now sensors with integrated phase-detection on the sensor itself, so you don&#x27;t need to split the optical path into a separate sensor. Canon has even announced a sensor where every pixel phase detects. That&#x27;s even more impressive as you&#x27;re not limited to a few autofocus points.<p>The other reason that mirrorless has it easier for autofocus is that the sensors can be always on, unlike a traditional SLR where the mirror is up for the exposure and the autofocus is literally in the dark. Sony&#x27;s SLT system already solves this by splitting the optical path continuously. Removing the mirror entirely is just the next step. That together with the more precise but slower contrast detection should make autofocus systems much better.",1377392153

I&#x27;ve tried over and over to use Linux as my primary OS, but every time the sheer jaggedness of the GUI experience, when I&#x27;m doing non-development (I guess normal consumer) things, bugs me non-stop until I switch back. It&#x27;s like switching from Ruby to C++. C++ is amazingly powerful and has great uses, but ultimately Ruby is a lot more enjoyable to use.<p>I think it&#x27;s just a personality difference. If you&#x27;re comfortable in the nitty gritty of linux, more power to you!  But you&#x27;re not going to convince me linux is better because you&#x27;re can change the window system or [insert some other component I wouldn&#x27;t care to change]. And you&#x27;re not even going to convince me you&#x27;re much more efficient. The arguments of efficiency and customization are always about low level details that I don&#x27;t need to care about, and that play no part in good software engineering.

6270415,comment,6268080,6268697,14,0,practicalpants,,,"Until recently, I also never thought loneliness was something that applied to me. I&#x27;m someone who experiences relatively long periods of isolation, whether its hacking on a project, reading, or as others have mentioned just interacting with co-workers or people you feel somewhat required to meet up with... because they&#x27;re someone you knew from college, someone from your professional network, or a friend of friend, yet you don&#x27;t really quite connect with them. I went on like this for years, but I never felt bad about it, or felt any sense of lack or nonfulfillment on a deeper level. FYI, mid 20&#x27;s here.<p>But then I got a girlfriend, and soon after she moved in with me. She lived with me for an entire year. Every day I&#x27;d wake up with the same person and go to sleep with the same person. Anytime I wanted to go out and do something where you wouldn&#x27;t want to do it alone, like people watching at parks, the beach, movies, new restaurants, road trips, new bars, etc., she was there and we would do it. I took up some new hobbies. We vibed really well for the most part, so lots of good and spontaneous interactions on a daily basis.<p>Then a couple months ago we broke up and she moved far away. Now I actually experience loneliness. I can&#x27;t just go back to the old way, and isolate myself for a week at a time for some project or to learn a new technology. Viscerally, my body can&#x27;t put up with it. I used to sleep incredibly when she was there. I could easily crawl into bed way before midnight or take naps during the day. Now I&#x27;m up late reading stuff or working on something every night, and I don&#x27;t feel that great about it, physically. I have lost the desire to continue any of the hobbies. I feel a constant subtle pressure like something is wrong and I need to do something to fix it. It&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m butt-hurt about the breakup (it was welcome at the time), it&#x27;s just not having a person like that in your life anymore.<p>I think the only reason I was able to go on the way I did prior to the cohabitation, was because I&#x27;d simply never experienced such raw, intimate human connection before, like the kind that comes with living in the same one bedroom apartment with an SO for a year. It felt like it awakened a truly human need that perhaps had been long suppressed or I had rationalized a way to keep a distance from.<p>At any rate, the experience will hopefully make it easier for me to find another gal out there, now that I recognize, or rather &quot;feel&quot;, the importance of deeper human connections.",1377391880

measurements of Casimir force between different types of conducting plates that have varying
designs. It is noteworthy that many of the researchers working in and with Brazil are Russian or
originally from Russia. The Brazilian research also mirrors Russian research (i.e., studying the
Casimir force using different setups of conducting plates). Both Brazil and Russia appear to be
focused, at a basic-science level, on maximizing the energy obtainable from the Casimir force. A.N.
Petrosyan, of the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, and Yu.E. Lozovik, of the Institute of
Spectroscopy of Russian Academy of Science, are conducting research into ZPE to create massless
particles in a cavity, but the value of this research is questionable.
(U) Research in France and a collaborative effort between the United Kingdom (UK) and Iran
comprise two of the most promising recent ventures in ZPE, as it pertains to MEMS and NEMS. The
French are researching the possibilities of using the Casimir force to drive nanoscale ratchets in the
hope of creating novel contactless translational actuation for NEMS or to move tiny objects in a liquid.
The UK-Iran effort has similar goals and focuses on a rack-and-pinion powered by Casimir forces to
enable contactless translation to avoid wear of the components. This work has demonstrated devices
that hold up to high velocities and is a good example of valuable work in ZPE for use in practical
applications.
(U) Germany has solid research programs in theoretical calculations, modeling, and experimental
measurements of Casimir forces in various conducting-plate and cavity configurations. Germany&#x27;s
research appears aimed more at basic science than in engineering for applications.
(U) India is studying the use of the Casimir effect for MEMS devices, such as calculations of effects

Disney received no funding, turned over almost $45bn and a profit of $9bn (Making it roughly as profitable as Google).<p>Not to mention if you couldn&#x27;t liquidate Facebook if you tried, but say you defied economics and did - you couldn&#x27;t buy even a single one of the top Hollywood studios with the proceeds - their market caps are all much larger than Facebook. It wouldn&#x27;t even make a scratch in the industry, let alone buy it out and shut it down.<p>Saying there isn&#x27;t enough money in Hollywood for VC&#x27;s to bother with is a bit like saying there isn&#x27;t enough money in oil.

Facebook, Google Search, News, Banner Ads, and Billboards are all about selling ads through raw attention. At the end of the day however, you wouldn&#x27;t pay to use Facebook, you  wouldn&#x27;t pay to look at Billboards, and as we have found recently, people don&#x27;t want to pay for news. Hollywood and Premium Content are about engagement. Its about creating an itch, and generating hype.

That is the biggest difference Hollywood and YouTube. No one is tripping over themselves, or camping out to watch a YouTube video.<p>Lastly, you can now see how this problem cannot be solved solely with technology.

Hell, the maximize button actually <i>doesn&#x27;t work</i>- it has such inconsistent use that you have almost no hope of actually getting what you want out of it. To get even decent window management, you have to buy software off of the app store.<p>Then, you have the fact taht you still functionally have a folder-based OS, which feels a greater need to present me with buttons to alter the view of a given folder, how icons are arranged, etc- all useful things no doubt, but things you don&#x27;t change on a per-folder basis that often- while literally not having an &quot;up one level&quot; button. At all. You either have to know the keyboard shortcut, or you have to go to the Go menu. The back button isn&#x27;t always dependable for this interaction(especially if the finder was just opened), so of course this just screws the whole pooch.<p>Seriously, the most I can get anyone to offer as to what makes OS X such a great operating system, is that it&#x27;s Unix with no driver problems.

Certainly, with a very keen sense of when to make the transition from Ain&#x27;t to Are, it can lead to time-savings and simpler and more focused code, but with less discipline or tight deadlines or (typically) both, it can also lead to repetition and the complexity of maintaining many one-off features, even if each is relatively simple in itself. Something very similar can be said for a more architectural philosophy - with a very keen sense of when a design is liberating and when it is burdensome, it can lead to less repetition and targeted maintenance, but with less discipline it can lead to analysis-paralysis and over-engineering.

I don&#x27;t see your &quot;issue&quot;, as using a master password does not &quot;defeat the whole purpose of password saving&quot; at all. Many people have different login credentials for different websites (not only passwords, also login name or email) which are hard to remember which one you used where. Having access to them with a single master password is convenience.<p>I like the way this is handled in Opera, where your passwords can never be accessed/viewed in plain text at any time. Once your login data are stored, you can simply use them via CTRL+ENTER on the login form and the data is pasted into it. If you want to you can use a master password to restrict access to that data. And you can even set a time after which the the browser will forget that password and then asks for it again after e.g. 15 minutes.",1377389369

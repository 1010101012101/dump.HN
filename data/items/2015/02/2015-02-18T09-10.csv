It definitely makes sense to support e.g. standard autoconf macros for detecting dependent libraries. Otherwise, people who try to build software from source (which most linux users do eventually) will get very confused when their build fails. (I remember getting bug reports from debian users who had installed kdemultimedia and some but not all of the kdemultimedia-devel packages - meaning that autoconf would detect that the kdemultimedia headers were installed, but then the specific header I was using wasn&#x27;t present).<p>If you can repackage without breaking the upstream-supported use cases then sure, go for it, if you want to.",1424253181
9067729,comment,9063843,9067073,0,0,ogrisel,,,"While fitting the algorithm might not often benefit from partitioned data, I see two upsides from using spark for predictive modeling.<p>First it makes it easy to do the feature extraction and model fitting in the same pipeline, hence make it possible to cross-validate the impact of the hyper-parameters of the feature extraction part. Feature extraction generally starts from a collection of large, raw datasets that needs to be filtered, joined and aggregated (for instance a log of user clicks, sessionized by user id over temporal windows, then geo-joined to GIS data via a geoip resolution of the IP address of the user agent). While the raw datasets of clicks and geographical databases might be too big to be processed efficiently on a single node, the resulting extracted features (e.g. user session statistics enriched with geo features) is typically much slower and could be processed on a single node to build a predictive model. However spark RDDs make it natural to trace the provenance hence trivial to rebuild downstream models when tweaking upstream operations used to extract the features. The native caching features of Spark make that kind of workflow very efficient with minimal boilerplate (e.g. no manual file versionning).<p>Second, while the underlying ML algorithm might not always benefit from parallelization in itself, there are meta-level modeling operations that are both CPU intensive and embarrassingly parallel and therefore can benefit greatly from a compute cluster such as Spark. The canonical case are cross validation and hyper-parameter tuning.",1424253105

Some managers are clumsy and behave among other people&#x27;s emotions like an elephant in a porcelain shop. Some are just awkward.<p>And then there is methodology. Corporations often have guidelines for how to do this. For instance, in the processes where I have been involved, there&#x27;s been a training and emphasis on how things are done: deliver a paper of this format, do it in a personal discussion if possible, with some rehearsed phrases to get around the awkwardness.

I completely agree with the <i>principles</i> behind these populist quips, but like most things in the real world, there are imperfections -- mitigating factors -- that can make the application of the principles complex. These are generalizations, and they&#x27;re good generally, but they&#x27;re not good all the time.<p>I&#x27;ve also been able to maintain good relationships across employment status changes, fwiw. I&#x27;ve hired back people I&#x27;ve fired before and maintain a good rapport with most employees I&#x27;ve had to dismiss. I&#x27;m in an engagement now with someone who I&#x27;ve hired myself, been hired by, quit on, and been fired by (remotely, for a gig he didn&#x27;t hire me for) and we&#x27;ve been able to remain friends through all of that, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a generalized issue with my conception around employment relationships.<p>EDIT: Also, even if people know a termination is coming somewhere along the line, it&#x27;s easy to forget and they often will have an adverse reaction when it actually comes down. I don&#x27;t think &quot;employee is so naive they think they&#x27;ll be kept around after X Y and Z&quot; is the only situation where this kind of consideration is appropriate. I guess we&#x27;ll just have to agree to disagree; we place fundamentally different values on &quot;looking someone in the eye&quot; (maybe because I&#x27;ve done so much telecommute stuff that I don&#x27;t see this as the MO for &quot;big decision&quot; discussions, at least not with reference to employment).

Sandboxing is partly intended to be an additional way to distribute software. Majority of the packages come from your distribution. This sandboxing (together with other bits) would allow you to distribute your application eventually 80% of the various Linux distribution users. I think it&#x27;ll take some time because there&#x27;s a lot of things to work out (e.g. relying on Wayland, kdbus, change Pulseaudio to use kdbus, etc).<p>A user should have control on what an application can do, but that&#x27;s something new and user might highly prefer such applications (e.g. not allowing an application to just modify ~/.bashrc and adding some evil sudo alias if it feels like it).<p>IMO at most you&#x27;d have some package software which shows for VLC: &quot;unrestricted access&quot;.

This has always been my biggest annoyance and one of the things that constantly made me pick the <i>cough</i> other BSD. Whenever something that I need isn&#x27;t in the package set, all hell breaks loose: most ports seem to have most options turned on by default (generating a lot of dependencies) and there seems to be no easy way to select configuration options <i>prior</i> to starting the whole build process -- so I end up having to sit for the next two hours, pampering the build process and tuning (actually, mostly disabling) options every time it moves on to the next port. Needless to say, this isn&#x27;t fun, especially since there&#x27;s no easy way to tell what dependencies an option is going to pull (I remember being able to retrieve that information through a script I cobbled up but...).<p>I could probably script it to just go ahead with the default dependencies, but that gives terrible results (I try to install this little console tool and now it&#x27;s pulling gnome-something-something because the console tool can be integrated with ImageMagick and that&#x27;s compiled with support for this-weird-format which is provided by this-weird-lib which is part of the Gnome project and now I&#x27;m slowly compiling half the packages in Gnome even though <i>I don&#x27;t use a single program from the Gnome project</i>).",1424250179

Such an interesting conjunction of masochism here from employers that feel they <i>need</i> to see the pain they&#x27;re causing their employees.<p>In this specific instance, I chose to fire her via email because 90% of our communication was via email, it usually takes weeks to schedule and actually get to an in-person meeting time (since she would cancel meetings probably 70% of the time), and we always meet in public places like coffee shops (her choice, not mine), where any visible emotional shock would be apparent to bystanders. It had much more to do with practicalities and concern for her privacy than any concern about &quot;saving myself&quot; from an adverse reaction (which I still got in a nasty retaliatory email).",1424250006

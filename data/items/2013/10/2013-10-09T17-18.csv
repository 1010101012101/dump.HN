My sample size may be less than a hundred, but you&#x27;re making an assumption that piercing sirens at night are the most effective way to alert the public of an emergency.

I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t build a large readership. We&#x27;ve seen it done many times.

6522709,comment,6513765,6520602,3,0,gruseom,,,"<i>Could you be more explicit</i><p>I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t remember the sources I read (other than Poundstone&#x27;s book) and don&#x27;t have time to dig into it just now, though given what I posted I suppose I should. FWIW, my memory is that he was asked about it more than once in the 1960s, denied that he&#x27;d said what he&#x27;d said, and then responded evasively when presented with evidence of it. On the other hand, my memory is that he&#x27;d advocated for a nuclear strike in print; and given the debate you linked to, that seems unlikely.<p>Edit: My conscience wouldn&#x27;t sit still until I did dig around a bit. The question is more controversial than Poundstone&#x27;s book made it seem, so I definitely shouldn&#x27;t have said &quot;definitely&quot;. When will I learn :) On the other hand, there&#x27;s a lot more material than that Economist article made it seem (the editor of Russell&#x27;s letters who was defending Russell in that piece really comes across as disingenuous for not mentioning this), and some of it is pretty unpleasant.<p>The consensus seems to be that Russell advocated threatening the USSR with nuclear strikes to force them to change their policies. Whether he advocated pre-emptive war itself is controversial. He made many comments about this in the 40s and 50s. From a BBC interview in 1959:<p><i>BBC: &quot;Is it true or untrue that in recent years you advocated that a preventive war might be made against communism, against Soviet Russia?<p>Russell: Its entirely true, and I dont repent of it.</i><p>Other comments were ambiguous (he thought it necessary to &quot;bully the Russians&quot; with the threat of bombing them but hoped it would not lead to war, etc.) Later, he claimed that he had simply &quot;entirely forgotten&quot; that he had ever advocated this. At least two serious biographers, Ronald Clark and Ray Monk, do not find this credible. Here&#x27;s Clark:<p><i>[Russell&#x27;s] explanation that he had simply forgotten what he had said [...] would be more acceptable if applied to one speech rather than to a long series of articles and statements [...] It might be possible to argue that his disavowal of advocating preventive war was based on the most academic interpretation of the term: that advocating the threat of war unless a potential enemy submitted, even though being prepared to have your bluff called, was not advocacy of a preventive war. But even this questionable escape-route is blocked by Russells own statement to [the BBC] and [by] his earlier suggestion that a casus belli would not be difficult to find&quot;.</i><p>This paper (a long and convoluted defense of Russell) shows up in Google and contains the salient quotes: <a href=""http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=russelljournal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?articl...</a><p>My conclusion is that what I wrote wasn&#x27;t far off, but it was unfair to lump Russell in with von Neumann, Lemay, and the rest of the Dr. Strangelove set who were advocating for nuclear war outright.",1381341259

I do agree that it can, and probably will increase risk taking, though. The risks I took on MDMA were social risks, things I don&#x27;t actually deem to be dangerous, things my fear stops me from doing but that I should probably be attempting more often.<p>I find that MDMA makes it very easy to &quot;open up&quot; to people and tell them what you think. This is probably one of the reasons why people are looking into using it as a therapeutic aid for PTSD and rape victims. In the context of a party though, this can translate in you being very comfortable telling your friends what you really think about them, even if it isn&#x27;t a good idea. I found I&#x27;m still able to ask myself rationally &quot;is this something I should be telling this person?&quot;, &quot;could this be hurtful to this person?&quot; and stop myself from saying stupid things. This is different from alcohol, which makes you both less anxious and less intelligent. I can tell you that on MDMA, I actually feel extremely sharp, more than normal (better recall, better verbal fluency, etc).<p>I can tell you that people have said stupid and offensive things to me while high on MDMA, however. One girl told me that she disliked my new hairstyle (thanks, I like it just fine), and also told me that she frequently had sex dreams about me, but that nothing could come of it since she had a boyfriend. Both of these were things I didn&#x27;t want to know. I will say though that this same girl has said more offensive and annoying things to me while sober.",1381340844

He figured out early on that reputation and image matter more than playing by the rules of some no-longer-meritocracy, and he focused primarily on his personal image at the expense of all else.<p>So he prioritized his reputation over that of Twitter, if the OP is accurate. Good for him! It worked out, didn&#x27;t it? From my read, he never-- not once-- tried to lash our or hurt Twitter. What he did do is use it to maximize its benefit to his reputation. People need to do that sort of thing if they want to be relevant in the Valley; it is, at this point, a reputation economy. Dorsey&#x27;s &quot;going rogue&quot;, if that is a correct story, was his having the sense to play it as one.<p>If it sounds like I&#x27;m being facetious, that&#x27;s not my intent.

A 60 Minutes segment reported that Dorsey founded Twitter because he was fascinated by trains and maps and how cities function. Later, he would explain that he first presented the idea, fully realized, on a playground in South Park. All along, Dorsey began casting himself in the image of Steve Jobs, calling himself an editor, as Jobs referred to himself, and adopting a singular uniform: a white buttoned-up Dior shirt, bluejeans and a black blazer.</i><p>I&#x27;m intrigued by how pathologically obsessed Jack Dorsey seems to be with Steve Jobs. The more I learn about both men, the more I&#x27;m convinced that Dorsey is simply trying to copy Jobs in everything he does, from the design of Square&#x27;s hardware and software to even the way he acts and talks in public.<p>I used to admire Dorsey greatly (and I still do to an extent), but the more I learn about him, the more I feel like I&#x27;ve been duped and manipulated, somehow.

Building out a product is hard and getting to big money is hard, but people and companies pay for service all the time. Turning a service into a product is something I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about lately and there seems to be an interesting spot forming between consulting and products.<p>The most interesting thing to me is the potential revenue difference between just a product and just a service.<p>For example, take something like Shopify. They are purely a product, they charge $79 and it&#x27;s totally hands off. If you were doing a custom shopping cart or whatever, you might charge $5,000 or something to build/cusotomize a solution.<p>There is very likely a place where you could run someone&#x27;s store for them for like $500-1,000 a month without them having to touch anything.  You could hire and train someone to run these stores and each person could run say 100 stores. That is 50-100k per month per person running those stores.<p>It would not be super difficult to find that many customers and be able to pay people to service those customers well. The outcome for said customers would likely be better than if they had to manage it themselves, but it would be a lot better than what most build and move on type consultant type arrangements would provide.<p>The same idea applies to a lot of niches, not just e-commerce.

</code></pre>
While we&#x27;re on the topic of Rust, the compiler actually used to do this! In the early days, the identifiers &quot;error&quot;, &quot;warn&quot;, &quot;info&quot;, and &quot;debug&quot; were all magical, undocumented constants for controlling logging levels. As you might expect, this caused problems. :P So don&#x27;t think that Patrick isn&#x27;t keenly aware of the perils of including non-keyword identifiers by default.<p>As for clang, their solution is the best they can do given that they don&#x27;t have the authority to make the call over whether to syntactically disambiguate macros. It&#x27;s definitely a debate to be had in the case of a language designed from scratch, and the Rust devs decided to err on the side of explicitness (you can contrast e.g. Elixir, which has the same sort of structural macros but chose not to distinguish their invocation syntax).",1381338037

When I first tried it, I found it quite amazing how a pill could completely eliminate my social anxiety for a few hours. I&#x27;d <i>never</i> felt so comfortable in my own skin and surrounding environment. I&#x27;d never realized that at every waking moment, even when alone, even when I think I&#x27;m pretty relaxed, I always feel some amount of background anxiety. This drug was able to take the anxiety down to zero. I was no longer afraid to go talk to strangers, I could really have fun at parties.<p>The downsides, though, are pretty obvious. For one, MDMA causes a crash. Sometimes, I&#x27;d be down for 2, even 3 days afterwards, which would be quite unpleasant and kill my productivity. Another thing is that well, anxiety and fear are sometimes useful. If you&#x27;re too trusting of people around you, you might eventually get yourself in risky situations. You might trust people you really shouldn&#x27;t.<p>There&#x27;s also been a study on MDMA that showed that it changes the way you interpret signs of rejection given off by people. You interpret people&#x27;s response to you more positively, even if it isn&#x27;t all that positive. MDMA can help you approach people, but it can also make you a little delusional (over optimistic) about the way people perceive you.<p>My personal opinion is that people with less baseline anxiety are probably still generally better off in the modern world. They&#x27;re less stressed, they&#x27;re more open to approaching and being approached by people, they end up having more friends because of this. They might have a tendency to be more trusting and not notice as much when they annoy people, but it probably generally works in their favor. I probably worry too much about displeasing other people.",1381338030

And to do so in a way that your app feels completely native.  PhoneGap does not offer this.  The only way to do it with PhoneGap is to actually point their UIWebView instance at a URL on the live internet, which makes your app slow.  That, or you'll have to build a lot of complicated syncing and caching and updating stuff, which is what we've built.<p>The second difference is more philosophical.  That is, for most apps, we don't believe that you should attempt to write a whole app inside a web view.  It just leads to apps that don't feel native.  So our approach, and the one that Clutch has been tuned for, is where you build most of your app using native tools.

Let's say that it removes an if statement because the variable a in the ""if(a)"" that starts it always is false. In C, code like ""x->y = 1;"" could affect the value of a, as could _any_ pointer dereference. If the JIT cannot prove that that could happen, it would have to insert a check ""does this modify a?"" for every such statement. I think there will be quite a bit of code out there where even a very smart JIT would not be able to conclusively prove that such aliasing does not happen.<p>Also, I do not accept that OpenCL argument. IMO, OpenCL is more similar to static compilation than to a JIT. It is as if you recompiled your kernels whenever you changed your video card (perhaps also when you change its configuration); it does not do things that a JIT would do, such as ""hm, most of the pixels are black; let's optimize for that case"".",1333581991

Patents are an example here; Google could sue all of its ""competitors"" out of existence today, but would that really benefit Google in the long term?  Would <i>you</i> work at Google if they were the company that put every tech startup out of business with ""method for computing the sum of two integer"" patents?  Probably not.  So aggressive patent lawsuits are not what Google's shareholders want.  And doing what the shareholders want is not exactly ""business cluelessness"" :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.buec.udel.edu/pollacks/Acct351/handouts/SEC%20Form%20S-1%20filed%20by%20Google.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buec.udel.edu/pollacks/Acct351/handouts/SEC%20For...</a>",1333581759

3800348,comment,3799616,3799991,1,0,CountHackulus,,,"Got any sources for that? I'm interested in reading that research.<p>Couple anecdotes:
I work in a semi rural neighborhood that's 2km from a regional airport (a bit off to the side of the approach path). I work right next to a window and haven't once heard an airplane go by. Now, this might be due to our shielded glass and white noise generators in the ceiling, but that's not bad.<p>Second anecdote, there was an airport downtown on the water that was re-opening with an airline running Bombardier Q400s (Porter Airlines at Billy Bishop). There was a group of protesters that were claiming that the noise would ruin the quiet of a nearby spit. So on the launch day, before the sun rose, they gathered at the spit to protest. Unfortunately for them, they missed the first flight as their talking had drowned it out.<p>Maybe it's just because I lived next to the railroad tracks for 20 years, but I say, bring on the jets.",1333580597

In this case, it's not so much jealousy as protecting one's turf.<p>In fact, I'd expect that the exact opposite occurs when the HR person is male: Prefer attractive females, and discriminate against good/successful looking males. It would be interesting to see a study that recorded in each case the gender of the HR person.<p>We like to think of ourselves as completely objective, but we never are.",1333580501

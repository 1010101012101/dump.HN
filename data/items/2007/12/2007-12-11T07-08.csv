Project management is a process, not an app. It should be done by people, not computers, and it requires energy and discipline, not algorithms or bar charts. <p>Face the reality:

How about a lottery inside project management app? (""Complete a milestone on time and get a chance to win a case of beer!""). Something to entertain and encourage poor souls who would be forced to use the app.",1197359870

Why? Because of magic. While all of the aforementioned effects of race on physiology links are well known and freely discussed, race cannot have any bearing on anything inside the skull, because <i>the brain is magic</i>.<p>Anybody that suggests otherwise, or suggests investigating or discussing the effects of race on the brain is a racist and we need to moderate them down. <p>The only people who would discuss such things are racists with an agenda like James Watson, not scientists like the people that understand how the brain has magical properties. <p>Brain=magic. You don't even need to read the article. Now lets moderate the racists down!",1197358411
88162,comment,88128,88138,0,0,jsb,,,"True. Penn State demands two home games for every one away game at Pitt because the football (and whatever tiny amount of money they raise from men's/women's basketball, if any at all) revenue pays for the ENTIRE cost of varsity Penn State athletics. They're very proud that none of our tuition is used for athletics. So they argue they need to have so many home games to ensure they continue to fund all of the other sports teams.<p>Plus Pitt would benefit from the rivalry much more than Penn State would. Pitt would sell out Heinz Field, something I'm not sure they have done other than maybe for a Backyard Brawl, while Penn State sells out over capacity for games against Florida International, as well as every other opponent.",1197358407

I have nothing to gain from whatever inborn virtues jews might have. But the evidence still stands... I also have nothing to gain from whatever inborn virtues the Chinese might have. But the evidence still stands... I'm also not offended by the Parsis or Armenians or Brahmans or any of them, despite their achievements. What does it cost to be honest?

Every piece of land in this world (with a few exceptions) has been overrun and plundered and ravaged time and time and time again. People just can't get over those evil European colonists.

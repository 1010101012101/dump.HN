[1]<p>And there's long been a separate (reduced) fee schedule for ""small entities"". And it's long been recognized those are still fairly high for situations like the lone-inventor, and such situations make up such a small slice of the USPTO's total revenue, that they certainly could be tweaked to be more accommodating without much net impact.<p>And because all that was well-known: \nThe AIA included giving the USPTO some fee-setting authority.  And one of their first proposals was to further reduce some small-entity fees and to create a new micro-entity status with commensurately-lower fees.<p>So it's not only a problem that would be fairly easy to address, without much adverse impact, it's actually already being addressed.

Code bombs dropped by consultants often have this sort of problem -- where some of the more invasive changes either aren't welcome or are more difficult to integrate with the existing system than they're worth. I'm hoping that having inline examples of working code, with references to the source, strikes a happy medium here. Plus, ""teach a man to fish"", and all.<p>That said, we do live in a Git world these days.

If we can find a way to host their files separately on S3 permanently, then the move would be effortless & many would thank.<p>There are so many users who don't understand what to do with their backup, for them moving to wordpress is too complex task.<p>I have reached out to Sachin aggarwal, but yet to hear a positive reply.

Each inventor would try to prove the date of invention through documentation (keep those lab notebooks - or that git repo, or the old svn or cvs repo backed up!).  Whoever successfully proves an earlier date of invention wins.<p>Under the new law, it's just who filed first.

5368470,comment,5363003,5368198,1,0,mercurial,,,"> In my opinion, the single-linked-list data structure as a foundation of Lisp was selected not by accident. It is also most basic and natural representation of many natural concepts - a chain, a list. You could ask for the next element, and find out that there is no more. Simple and natural. Because of its simplicity the code is also simple.<p>Yes, that's a recursive data structure well-suited to functional languages, same as Haskell lists.<p>> Such kind of lists should be heterogeneous, because when all the elements are of the same type, it is more natural to represent it as an array - an ordered sequence.<p>From a memory point of view, maybe, but that's really an implementation detail. If you take, eg, Perl arrays, which you can access by index, push, shift, unshift, and pop, the actual implementation is invisible from the programmer, just as it should be in this sort of language. Java will happily store cats and dogs in an array of Object, for instance.<p>> Now consider a UTF-8 encoding. It is a variable-length encoding. UTF-8 string is not an array, and because you cannot tell the boundaries between runes while reading, is not a list. But, nevertheless it could be considered and processed as a stream, until EOL marker is reached. This is why it was invented in Bell Labs to keep things as simple as possible.<p>You could very well store it as a list of bytes. This wouldn't be terribly efficient, but it's perfectly doable. Whether you process it as a stream or you have it stored in whatever array/collection is orthogonal to the fact that your language of choice supports heterogeneous lists. You can do stream processing in Haskell too (with, eg, pipes). You have also access to other data structures which are not lists, but which do expect to be homogenous.",1363184093

I don't think in perhaps 7 or 8 years of regular ebay purchases (probably between 1 and 10 a month) I've had more than a few issues. Sometimes things get lost in the post (especially if the seller is based in China or Hong Kong), but they're often quite apologetic about it and often send another one if it never arrives.<p>It may be that in the past postage costs were hidden, but they've made it very clear now. The buyer pays the price + postage, both of which are clearly visible on the search page and repeated on the item and purchase page.<p>eBay is <i>fantastic</i> for small electronic components. If you need a couple of capacitors or a single (popular) chip, the price + postage is always considerably less than buying from a mainstream retailer (where 10+ postage for anything is the norm).

You can&#x27;t assess the value because private companies rarely assess themselves (tax reasons, strategic reasons) and who you&#x27;re selling to can also be limited, e.g. by requiring full board approval.<p>If the company is in trouble at some point then investors and shareholder watch each other (in the negative sense) and it&#x27;s get political who can sell and how much. In worst case you have to deal with power play in the board, an in-transparent situation where you might not even know all the players.<p>As you can see the risk increases.

Tufte CSS was a toy project that seemed worth sharing. It turns out, figuring out which of his methods translate from print to the web is not straightforward. It&#x27;s an exercise. That process of implementing sidenotes (for instance), and thinking about what they mean in the modern web, is valuable. Sidenotes are but one technique, like data-&quot;ink&quot; ratios and minimal use of hierarchical headings are merely guiding ideas. My goal with Tufte CSS was not to say &quot;this is how websites should look&quot; but rather &quot;here are some techniques we&#x27;ve found useful elsewhere; maybe you&#x27;ll find them useful on the web&quot; and &quot;here is a sketch of implementing this set of ideas&quot;.<p>While I do think Tufte CSS could be a good starting point for a variety of webpages that want to communicate a point using text, tabular data, figures, and code, I don&#x27;t think that websites should see Tufte CSS, or Tufte&#x27;s print projects in general, as a design goal. Different projects, in whatever media, should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.<p>Anyway, I apologize for giving the impression of cargo-culting. If there&#x27;s any way I can change the wording in either the README or the demo doc to better reflect that this is not a design prescription, please let me know.",1438920202

[1] People with normal ALDH2 metabolize alcohol normally. Those with variant ALDH2 process acetaldehyde poorly, so this unpleasant metabolite remains in their blood longer, causing discomfort and flush. Those with 0 variant alleles drink more than those with 1 allele; those with both mutations in alleles drink the least.<p>Let&#x27;s say you had some variant like that, but for spicy food metabolism. The more variants in this spicy food metabolism gene, the more spicy the food felt to you so you might eat less.<p>If those who would be genetically expected to tolerate more spicy food survived longer than you would otherwise expect in a (genetic) dose-dependent fashion, then this would be suggestive that spicy food intake might be in the causal pathway of longevity. You would have to do additional work to be sure that the gene didn&#x27;t do other things in metabolism (pleiotropy) that directly had effects on longevity.<p>1 = <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3525274/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3525274/</a>",1438920131

We&#x27;ve been hard at work and are happy to announce we are releasing our free 2015 fantasy football draft optimizer apps. The apps allow you to calculate custom projections for your league based on your league settings. The projections incorporate more sources of projections than any other site, and have been the most accurate projections over the last 3 years (http://fantasyfootballanalytics.net/2015/02/best-fantasy-football-projections-2015.html). Based on these projections, the draft optimizers determine the best players to draft based on your risk tolerance. The Auction Draft Optimizer dynamically updates its selections as you draft.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear what people think. We&#x27;re planning on keeping the tools for free so that we can continue to help out the community.

It&#x27;s important but it&#x27;s separate, and it&#x27;s truly only important to us (the importance of our own thoughts are personal). Evidence, once internalized, is analyzed through introspection, and hence internally maintaining the subjective-objective distinction requires discipline and practice. Without this distinction, it turns out we can quite effortlessly reason our way to most conclusions given any evidence, and this activity is mainly driven by our intentions and emotions. Herein lies the dangers of putting too much un-founded weight on thought. But when we let evidence determine the weight distribution of thoughts, we avoid this problem. It also turns out that good evidence is obvious, making it easy to remember and requiring little thought.<p>Sherlock Holmes is my favorite example. His breakthroughs come primarily from observations and connecting dots (insight) [0], and not from deep questioning or deductive logic. Though important, those aren&#x27;t actually that hard or productive or entertaining.<p>Evidence is the originator, and the tangible of the two. Our imagination may take us anywhere (Einstein), but without evidence we&#x27;d get nowhere (scientific method).<p>[0] Holmesian deduction consists primarily of observation-based inferences.\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#Holmesian_deduction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#Holmesian_dedu...</a>",1439938547

10082716,comment,10080731,10082660,0,0,tolmasky,,,"There&#x27;s different tradeoffs of course, and we&#x27;ve obviously been inspired by iPython and Mathematica and other interactive programming environments. Tonic is in large part asking whether we can take the lessons of interactive programming and make them useful to broader software development (hence a focus for example on object viewers to analyze binary data). I think the features called out in the site are pretty unique, but perhaps some conceptual differences are warranted.<p>The key differences I would say are:<p>1. The fact that you have access to every NPM package. Node is now the environment with the most amount of packages, chances are someones solved part of your problem already, why not have all that code at your fingertips?<p>2. It was crucial in our mind to exactly match the behavior the code would have if you ran it through node as if it were a straight file. That means, for example, that every cell has to execute <i>synchronously</i> after the last (not async, you can&#x27;t have ticks happen in between cells -- you&#x27;re code will now behave dramatically differently if you download it, especially in an environment so dependency on asynchronous behavior like node). It really is like a living file: even hoisting works -- you&#x27;ll notice that if you modify a function that is referenced in an earlier cell, Node will notify you that you&#x27;ve &quot;changed&quot; the past, and will rerun from that point. This is very different from the additive nature of iPython style repls where every cell stomps on top of the last. In Tonic, no code that has run isn&#x27;t on the screen: because it really is like just running the file (again, you can download it and run it yourself).<p>3. Related to 1, notebooks are also easily publishable in a living way: a node notebook <i>is</i> just a node package. So you can require an notebook from any other notebook, instant sharing.<p>4. Our take on object viewers - we want these to be discoverable, not a part of the code, its a view on the results. Tonic fundamentally deals with Javascript objects, but the object viewers are applied on top -- post execution you can decide to look at an image as an image, or hex viewer, or download. An array could be a coordinate or a graph, both are available to you to switch between, not a function you call to display your data. We really want the tool to help you find new views on your data.",1439938052

Funding is available for basic science only; the very difficult work of bringing genetics to market is simply not funded.  Funding for research into e.g. drought resistance is limited to understanding genetic pathways.  The closest you get to useful traits is QTL analysis.  Make no mistake, this is very useful, foundational research.  It enables a variety of approaches to creating new crops.  It does not, however, create them.<p>Public funds <i>should</i> be used in this way.  We should bring back seed banks, co-ops, and fund grants that actually aim to bring marketable traits to useful inbreds.

This is the wrong attitude.<p>When manipulating any kind of object in the real world there are a series of tools.  Each has their own feel, way you interact with it, and is used for a specific purpose.  A hammer, saw, sander, file, router, nail, all do different things.  The interface to them is unique.<p>Programming needs to follow this model.  Each scenario is different so they need to be handled separately.  Allow for a comprehensive general framework and then people create tools for each scenario.  The tools can be general purpose or very specific.<p>Work with the general purpose AST with tons of annotations (comments, 2D coordinates for visual layout tools like NoFlow style, etc).<p>Also, depending on what you are focusing on at the time you may want a different view of the code.  Think how architecture is different.  Framers have their own annotation.  Then there are plumbing and electrical overlays.  There are also wireframes and fully rendered views.  Top, bottom, orthogonal, perspective, etc.  You get the idea.<p>Start with model, view, controller.  Each is unique.  It can be visualized and written differently.  Right now we use the same text based language to describe each and to read each.<p>When you have a general purpose AST then the code can be &quot;read&quot; in different modes (each with their own strengths and weaknesses).<p>Also, sometimes is is easier to write in one form and read in another.

Just like most noncompetes is much more loosely defined. When it comes to sue, almost everything in technology can be argued to be related to everything else. Google or anyone running an ad exchange/real-time auction can definitely be argued to be a competitor.<p>> You also get paid your normal salary during those time (just to chill around).<p>Not factually correct. You only get your base salary which can be a small portion of the total compensation.<p>> One of my friends is using that to travel all over the place.<p>Well, if you enjoy a <i>forced</i> vacation, good for you. I don&#x27;t think everyone does.<p>> If you go to other tech company like FB or Google then you can start the next day (which I did)<p>Even if they ignore the explicit non-compete clause, the separate IP assignment provision is troublesome for the target company. I wonder how the destination company would react to that if they read it carefully. For me, the period of that even exceeded the explicit non-compete, and that was super problematic.  Also, they have this weird clause to extend the noncompete period if you are found in violation of it, which makes zero logical sense in a fair contract. In effect, it also has the side effect of being a theoretical legal risk to you, forever, even beyond the explicit non-compete period (due to the possibility of recursive extension).<p>> It doesn&#x27;t affect you that much though (you can&#x27;t refer people you know from TS or give them recommendation, that&#x27;s it).<p>Not true. The non-solicit covers investors as well as employees. You are not allowed to solicit or take money any of their investors for any purpose, which means you cannot start a simple tech startup.  Since you have no idea who their investors are, you are risking a violation by talking to <i>any</i> investor. Even the language of the employee non-solicit clause is much stricter than Google&#x27;s.<p>> If you actually follow the law suits, those people actually tried to upload model to external servers. If you try to do that with Google&#x27;s HIP code I&#x27;m pretty sure they would do the same to you.<p>There are two lawsuits I am aware of. This is factually incorrect about one of them. For the other one, if you actually read the documents and testimonies on both sides, it is hard to reach the conclusion that it was anything but a non-compete issue.  Based on what I read in the media, it seems the judge in NY court apparently didn&#x27;t feel like the fact that they made a criminal lawsuit out of it was just, so I have serious doubts about the speculation that Google would have done the same in this exact scenario. Of course, this is my interpretation. I encourage people who are interested to look it up themselves on the court website. You can find an older version of the employment agreement there as well (mine was definitely worse). It&#x27;s an amusing read, actually. It shows how arrogant and evil an employment contract can get:<p><a href=""https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/CaseSearch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/CaseSearch</a><p>Solve the captcha and search for Two Sigma Investments.

Thinking back now, however, something tells me that if my parents had tried to push me into programming, I might have become less interested in it than I actually did. An important factor when growing up is a sense of discovery -- that you have found something for <i>you</i> -- rather than doing something just because people want you to. Even as a kid, you have a sense that your parents want you to do things not for you but for them to show off to other parents. A smart kid may recognise this conflict of interest.",1439935277

I am aware of at least the following services that use all or part of the same spectrum that 2.4 GHz wifi uses:<p>1. Radiolocation services (e.g., radar).<p>2. Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) devices operating under Part 18 of the FCC regulations.<p>3. Amateur radio (ham) operators operating under Part 97 of the FCC regulations.<p>4. Wifi, RF remote controls, Bluetooth, microwave ovens, cordless phones, wireless microphones, and many other things, operating under Part 15 of the FCC regulations. (Note: note all instances of all of these devices will be in the 2.4 GHz band. For instance. There are other bands available for most of these, and which a particular device uses is up to the manufacturer).<p>There may be other services operating under other parts of the FCC rules that I did not list (because I don&#x27;t know about them).<p>The above are listed in order of priority. The rules are simple:<p>• You cannot interfere with users of services above yours the list. For instance, if a ham radio operator interferes with an ISM user, the ham has to stop the interference. How he does that is up to the ham...he could reduce power, or use a directional antenna aimed away from the ISM device, or move to a different frequency, but if he can&#x27;t stop the interference by such means, then he has to stop transmitting.<p>• If a user of a service above you on the list interferes with you, it&#x27;s entirely your problem, not theirs. They have no obligation whatsoever to take any steps to reduce or eliminate their interference with you.<p>So here is the hack. Get some part 18 certified ISM device that is very sensitive to interference from wifi--so sensitive that it is pretty much impossible to operate wifi near it without interfering--and operate it on site. Now anyone who fires up wifi will interfere, and you can ask them to stop and if they do not they are violating FCC regulations.",1439935266

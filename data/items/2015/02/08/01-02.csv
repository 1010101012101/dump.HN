9016143,comment,9015663,9016112,0,0,darkmighty,,,"RF refers to specific frequencies of radiation, which are not popularly known as light at all. Radio is usually in the MHz range to a few GHz (10^6-10^9 Hz). Light starts a hundreds of Terahertz (10^14 Hz). The behavior is qualitatively different at usual scales due to quantum mechanical behavior (light is difficult to emit/absorb coherently -- it&#x27;s more particle-like) at high frequencies.<p>A photon striking a semiconductor will probably displace an electron <i>if</i> given an adequate bandgap, creating a voltage spike (which is nonlinear -- i.e. the problem isn&#x27;t a propagating terahertz wave obviously). An incident radio wave will cause voltage spikes through coherent induction in the wires (i.e. they act as an usual antenna).",1423360791

Perhaps a better word would be &quot;doomed&quot;, which is to say that the economic axioms it was built on are no longer as firmly true as once they were, so the industry cannot continue in its current form indefinitely. It may continue for a little while from sheer momentum, and until the future becomes more evenly distributed, and it may eventually reinvent itself (and I hope it does) in a way that is sustainable under these new conditions, but something&#x27;s got to change.<p>> Although I don&#x27;t have numbers, it is my impression that many more musicians / songwriters are making a full time living at their music than in the past.<p>My impression is that a lot of these musicians and songwriters are finding fans over the Internet, playing small venues and touring small areas, with maybe the help of a manager or two. When most people think of a phrase like &#x27;rock star&#x27;, they probably imagine someone who finds fans by paying for lots of radio play, who fills stadiums and tours the world with the help of a giant record label who  might have hundreds or thousands of artists signed to it. When I say &#x27;the entertainment industry is doomed&#x27;, I&#x27;m heavy on the &#x27;industry&#x27; - the giant record labels, the world tours and saturating advertising are doomed because digital reproduction puts a cap on how much money can be extracted from a particular recording. These musicians and songwriters you talk about have already figured out how to earn a living in the post-Internet era, and I hope they can serve as an example to artists in other media who currently believe that the existing industry must be propped up indefinitely so they can earn a living.",1423359874

Granted, Mac OSX doesn&#x27;t natively support the LXC&#x27;s docker uses (c&#x27;mon Apple!), so we&#x27;ll still be running 1 VM, but that&#x27;s a huge improvement over our existing implementation.

It was not the only time, I met him in three-four occasions. &quot;\nThis witness is a &quot;director programmer&quot;(??) from Calabria, he lived in Rome when he was young, but he wants to remain anonymous. \n&quot;Majorana was in Pilotta Square, on the Università Gregoriana&#x27;s stair, near Fontana di Trevi. He looked like more than 70 years old&quot;, the guy was helping homeless people during those years, he was puzzled by one other homeless saying that guy (Majorana) had the solution to &#x27;Fermat Theorem&#x27;&quot;, which was solved only in 2000. \n&quot;Then I said that I wanted to meet him with Di Liegro&quot;, the meeting happened and the priest drove Majorana back home. &quot;After one hour and half he came back and said to me: &#x27;you know who that man is? He is the physicist Ettore Majorana, the one missing. I phoned the monastery where he was hosted and they told me he left. Now I brought him back.&#x27;&quot;\nThe director of the monastery said &quot;Majorana had the feeling his studies could precede the atomic bomb and he had a conscience crisis and he wanted to be forgotten.&quot;\nIt seems Majorana was in another monastery in Napoli before the one in Rome. They were sure he was him for a scar in his right hand. The witness says &quot;I asked priest Luigi to tell Majorana&#x27;s family, but he said we must not. I tried to speak about the subject several times during the years, but Di Liegro, who never told anyone, not even his most close assistants, he didn&#x27;t want to speak about it and he told me to shut up. He told me to not say anything to anybody until 15 years until his dead, happened the 12 October 1997. Now the time has passed.&quot;<p>Fuck Google Translate is way better than this crap.

9016027,comment,9015663,9015977,0,0,lotsofmangos,,,"All chips are photosensitive and a xenon flash produces light from UV through to IR, so my guess would be that the plastic used for the casing on that chip is not entirely opaque to something at the top or bottom end of the visible spectrum, which is why most bright lights don&#x27;t trigger it. At a bet, I&#x27;d say the top end, as otherwise radiant heaters would also probably kill them. Would be fun to play around with some filters and a flashgun and narrow down the frequency.",1423357495

You can increase the blocksize which will result in a higher theoretical transaction rate, but then you&#x27;re burning more resources on orphan blocks , DDoS, etc. So while you can increase it, there are serious downsides to doing so past a certain point which still ends up being a lot lower than what&#x27;s needed to have the acceptance level of Paypal.",1423357420

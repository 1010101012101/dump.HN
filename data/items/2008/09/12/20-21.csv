302691,comment,302077,302519,0,0,astine,,,"The trick isn't to convince the hard line critics, but to marginalize them. The vast majority of people have no hard fast opinions on the matter and are only aware of what the trends are. If Microsoft can put out a positive message <i>and</i> get that message repeated and talked about, the naysayers will begin to look silly. There's just enough latent resentment against the snobbishness of the Mac campaigns for this to work.<p>This is not just marketing, it's politics. You could draw parallels to current US presidential election, but I won't because I know where it will lead.",1221253172

302686,comment,302077,302196,0,0,neilc,,,"Nonsense. The ad is interesting and faintly amusing, and the advertising strategy from which it is drawn is worthy of discussion. I think you are <i>vastly</i> overreacting to say it is ""goofball lowbrow crap"", or that it ""makes us into Microsoft's tools"": YCers are more than capable of viewing an ad without being brainwashed, I think.",1221252816

A corporate can basically never compete against this kind of desire (which, is actually quite rare).<p>Even though I've got more senior over the years, you just end up with less control over more - until you reach the point that you're just a powerpoint jockey.<p>It's almost impossible to do something innovative at a large corporate - because of the inertia and the massive amount of consensus building that's required to do anything different. Pure design doesn't exist, it's an exercise in compromise.<p>That's not meant to knock it. The environment suits many (i.e most) people. It won't suit everyone though.<p>Personally, I've never found going over the top to keep someone around is a good idea - If someone wants to leave to broaden their horizons, I'd encourage it.<p>Sometimes they leave and succeed - then they're a great person to keep in contact with. Sometimes they leave and it doesn't work out - in this case they sometimes come back, and usually a much better and more capable person for the experience.",1221251818

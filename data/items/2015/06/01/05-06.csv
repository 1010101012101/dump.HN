I don&#x27;t want to work at companies that only hire people who memorized Red-Black trees.<p>If you don&#x27;t remember, just say so. Try to reason about it, stating what you do know and can calculate on the back of an envelope. (I know quicksort is faster than N^2). You don&#x27;t even need a google search to look up the details on an algorithm. Knowing when to use what algorithm is far more important.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s just like they said in school: Show your work. Tell us how you arrived at your answer. Tell us how confident you are in the answer.<p>If you do want to practice, open a (non-highlighting) text editor and code something trivial. See if you can get it to compile on the first time. Repeat with other small problems. (This is how we did it in the old days.)<p>> What are the best prep resources?<p>Your stories. Passion projects you&#x27;ve completed. Interesting debugging techniques. What you did when the answer was not in the documentation.",1433138394

9636973,comment,9636450,9636760,0,0,arca_vorago,,,"&quot;This is a domestic crime tool, not only for terrorism.&quot;<p>Indeed, the primary realpolitik answer that you wont hear from anybody in the beltway till theyve had a few and have a cigar in their hand is that technology has so changed the landscape of threats and potential threats that actions that used to require nation state financial, logistal, etc support can now be accomplished by a single non-state actor, hence, we really &quot;need&quot; to collect it all.<p>The reason this scares the intel community so much is because generally, with some exceptions, if a foreign country sends actors over we tend to know about it due to how deep our tendrils are and the fact that we are setting ourselves up as the main repository of data for even foreign govs to access. (The point being we know what they access and look at), but if all of a sudden we feel like it could be anybody then you get an intel community thats in hypervigilante mode and that mode will wear you out fast, its a mentally degraded state for anything other than actual fighting.<p>im guessing some modifications to the way threats are quantitavely measured is in order, but no one really wants to do that these days. Ive heard rumors over the past few years of an increasing trend to get rid of all the salty old greybeards who tell truth to power... What we will end up with is a beltway full of people who are either too naive to know better and just tout the line, or a bunch of kissass mortage-payers who would condone genocide if it made sure their kids go to a ivy league college. Which essentially what William Binneys says happened when they scrapped his lower cost program designed to at least attempt to protect privacy in favor of a billion dollar blank check for another less effective solution.<p>The bottom line is that by attempting to collect it all before they fully understand how to parse the data, they actually weakened American security in all its various forma.<p>I am curious though when you say come up with a market solution. The problem is that markets simply dont work like you were taught in college economics. For example, the market profitted from the weakening of American security because the more expensive program put more dollars into a few VA counties. I would like some sort of example of how the markets will ever be anything other than opposed to actual progress if it makes them less money.<p>Therein lies the problem, weve allowed our own &quot;representative governemnt&quot; to become completely detached from the people due to their attachment to &quot;markets&quot;.<p>Does anybody in DC even remember what their oaths were anymore? to protect and defend THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA from enemies foreign AND DOMESTIC...<p>Id say our real enemies, the ones threatening the Constitution (as opposed to safety) are domestic, and they wear suits and ties and not burkahs, and quantifiably so.",1433138146

And it wasn&#x27;t originally made by Microsoft: it was made by Seattle Computer Products and called QDOS and later 86-DOS, and Microsoft bought it from them. As a side note, the name MS-DOS came later: the original version for the IBM PC was called &quot;PC DOS&quot;, and the name &quot;MS-DOS&quot; first appeared when Microsoft began courting the clone market. The version of the OS for IBM products continued to be called PC DOS, and after Microsoft and IBM fell out, IBM continued to maintain PC DOS as an independent fork while Microsoft continued to develop MS-DOS.<p>But, getting back to the point...<p>IBM originally wanted a straight-up port of CP/M by the original author (Gary Kildall). When IBM tried to contact Kildall, he wasn&#x27;t home, and his wife (who was officially his business partner) talked to them instead. His wife laid down a number of demands that made IBM wary of doing business with the Kildalls. So Microsoft swooped in and offered up DOS at a very low price. The IBM PC launched with PC DOS, written by Microsoft in collaboration with IBM.<p>Shortly after the launch, IBM patched things up with the Kildalls: Gary developed a port called CP/M-86 as part of the deal, and IBM offered their customers a choice of operating systems. By that point, though, IBM had negotiated a great deal with Microsoft and a very expensive deal with the Kildalls. An IBM PC equipped with PC DOS cost <i>considerably</i> less than an IBM PC equipped with CP/M-86, and nobody wanted to buy the latter when they could save a lot of money and buy the former. Besides, x80 CP/M apps wouldn&#x27;t run on CP/M-86, and PC DOS had already built up a wealth of popular apps since it came out first, so CP/M-86 died in what was possibly the first instance of an &quot;app gap&quot;.",1433136397

Zed&#x27;s does introduce things in the wrong order and in a very confusing fashion.  The rant about C strings is also completely misguided and would lead a novice off course into using ugly thickets of macros and crappy frameworks rather than simply using C strings correctly.  Any C function will misbehave if passed invalid input... and things like valgrind, which Zed is clearly well aware of, make C-style strings much less dangerous.<p>Zed also made many completely unjustified attacks on the K & R book, which is a well-written, easy to read book which introducse C concepts in a clear and readable way.  Even if this was justified (and it&#x27;s really, really not), that all belonged as a separate blog article rather than as part of an alleged &quot;tutorial.&quot;<p>Finally Zed published a &quot;rebuttal&quot; to all of this in which he basically says that C sucks, is not worth learning, and he&#x27;s learning Go.  So the author quite reasonably asks, why would you want to learn C from someone who doesn&#x27;t like the language or think it&#x27;s worth learning?<p>I think we can all agree that Go (or some other high level language) probably is the better choice for most projects.  But after all, there are still many places where C will continue to be used like the Linux kernel.  Those people would be much better off reading K&R, as old as it is, than anything Zed has written.

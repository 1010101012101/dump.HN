Many developers will probably not remember to do this - if they&#x27;re maintaining their apps at all.<p>Dart2js is also an afterthought (in general) compared to the mainline dart vm, so it will be possible (if not common) for dart applications to end up only being compatible with Chrome&#x27;s implementation.

But I think it&#x27;s relatively small. Other factors, some mentioned on other comments, can come into play. For example:<p>* much easier way to order fresh groceries online in the UK (including Sunday delivery, 1 hr delivery slot, mobile apps etc)<p>* execution, execution, execution (I can&#x27;t tell about the OP, but the founder of Marley Spoon is also a founder of Delivery-Hero, which is well-established in the fast-food delivery online market)",1410080654

Here&#x27;s a few <i>strong</i> features that add up:<p>- optional static type annotations<p>- advanced object-oriented features (mixins, advanced constructors, etc)<p>- rich built-in libraries<p>- pub package manager<p>- 2X V8 performance w/ the Dart VM<p>- integrated tooling<p>- exceptions<p>- generics<p>- operator overloading...<p>I could go on, but basically I&#x27;m not sure what language you were looking at because Dart has a lot that plain vanilla JavaScript does not (although can have with extensions). It also doesn&#x27;t inherit all of those flaws JavaScript got from being designed in a time crunch (10 days is really not enough time to design a language).<p>If I had to pick one though, it would probably be the fact that <i>Dart is a platform</i> (rich language, libraries, tools, and package manager) rather than hodge podge of frameworks on top of a lightweight language.",1410080575

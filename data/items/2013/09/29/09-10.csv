Other people&#x27;s code will be easy to understand and maintain. So it&#x27;s good for everyone in the long run. Being able to express complicated ideas in simple ways is very valuable.<p>If you think it&#x27;s an advantage that it&#x27;d take someone else years of learning a language before they can understand the code you wrote, Go is not for you.

This is exactly the kind of thing which could have been caught by some kind of run-time analysis, either by hand or through some automated process that&#x27;s part of the &quot;approval&quot; needed to be on the Play Store. Given Google&#x27;s technical chops, I doubt they would have a hard time checking for this automatically at submission time, so they wouldn&#x27;t have to hire a staff of human reviewers like Apple does. It might slow down the process of posting things to the store just slightly, but in the end it would benefit users.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6329490"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6329490</a>",1380448648

The idea is based on free market capitalism and while it has been around for a while we now know that it works. Kickstarter has demonstrate that it can not only raise millions to finance hardware development and commercial games [2] but also substantial money for free software [3]. \nI truly believe that at this point, all we need is to propagate this idea and help FOSS developers to crowdfund their projects. Once a project has collected enough money for a first working version, subsequent development can be financed by donations, support or merchandizing. Major updates could again be financed over crowd funding.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android?ref=most-funded"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/659943965/planetary-annihilation-a-next-generation-rts?ref=live"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/659943965/planetary-anni...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeyh/git-annex-assistant-like-dropbox-but-with-your-own?ref=live"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeyh/git-annex-assistan...</a>",1380448576

That world is perfectly achievable, it&#x27;s basically already happened outside the Microsoft ecosystem.<p>OSX and Linux default to using UTF-8 everywhere, Ruby on Rails is UTF-8 only, the assumed source encoding in Python 3 is UTF-8, URI percent-encoding is done exclusively using UTF-8, HTML5 defaults to UTF-8...  The list goes on and on.  &quot;UTF-8&quot; is becoming synonymous with &quot;text&quot;.<p>In an all-UTF-8 world, if you want to build a URI parser, or a CSV parser, or an HTML parser, or really anything that does any kind of text processing (except rendering), you can just assume ASCII and everything will work as long as you&#x27;re 8-bit clean.  Even non-US codepages are all more-or-less supersets of ASCII.  The only major exceptions are EBCDIC and UTF-16.<p>Because of UTF-16, we have to build charset conversion/negotiation into every single interface boundary, where we could otherwise just be 8-bit clean except in places where text actually has to be <i>rendered</i>.<p>It&#x27;s completely unnecessary friction that undermines one of the big motivations for creating Unicode in the first place: coming up with a single standard for text representation, so that we don&#x27;t have to deal with the mess of handling multiple charsets everywhere.<p>None of these decisions is a big deal in isolation, but it&#x27;s a death by 1000 cuts.  When you have mountains of unnecessary complexity, it only serves to make programming inaccessible to ordinary people, which is how we get awful policies like SOPA, software patents, and the like.",1380448336

One very successful venture was Openshot, an open source video editor (GPL licenced) which had a goal of $20.000 but which reached $45.000.<p>Granted we aren&#x27;t in a situation where it&#x27;s possible to make a full-time career out of developing open source software through Kickstarter style donations, but I think it&#x27;s not such a big step as one might think.<p>I would happily pay a small sum each month for someone (or someone&#x27;s) to work on FOSS software I use a lot, and I think a large number of people out there would do the same, atleast enough for someone to make a decent living out of it.<p>Again I believe the key aspect is to make the payment convenient/safe and of course have a way for projects to gain exposure.<p>Paying a small lump sum each month for continued free open source development of software you use/rely on for your work is in my book a much better long term solution than to pay a larger sum for the latest update of &#x27;proprietary software X&#x27; where you are solely dependant on that provider and have to accept their conditions in terms of price/licencing not to mention the intrusive DRM mechanism which are a de facto part of proprietary software today.<p>Compare that to the FOSS situation where, given that the source code is open (and due to copyleft any forks will also remain open), you will never be locked-in to one provider and their whims even if you are totally dependant on that specific piece of software.<p>Anyway I&#x27;m not pretending that this is the &#x27;perfect solution&#x27;, but I dare say proprietary software certainly isn&#x27;t (and I make a living off writing proprietary software and have for the past 8 years) and I think that a shift from relying on proprietary to instead relying on open source code is of great importance for many of the reasons RMS outlined.

6464675,comment,6461936,6462232,1,0,mistercow,,,"Critical thinking and memorization are not intrinsically at odds with each other. Rather, they are separate tools that are powerful when used together. If your critical thinking is strong, it can be used instead of memorization, but relying on this is a crutch, and it hurts you in the long run.<p>I fell into this trap in math classes all the time. My exams would be covered in work where I would do something like reinventing the chain rule from the definition of the derivative. The definition of the derivative is elegant and obvious in its workings, and therefore easy to remember based on critical thinking. The chain rule commonly useful, but it&#x27;s a special case, and the end result is opaque. So I wouldn&#x27;t remember it, and I&#x27;d just figure it out from scratch on test day.<p>As it turned out, that got me plenty far. But my grades would have been better if, having understood how to derive it, I had cached it in long term memory. I would have made fewer mistakes, had less work to check, and more time to check it.<p>These days the same thing happens when I&#x27;m working on a math problem for practical purposes. I don&#x27;t have a lot of these formulas committed to memory, so instead of spending time on actually solving the problem I have, I have to spend time rebuilding math from scratch.<p>It&#x27;s the same basic concept as caching and memoization in programming. It would be a mistake to write every function as a giant look up table to handle each parameter combination. But if your code keeps calling the same expensive pure function with the same parameters, you can greatly speed it up by caching the result.",1380447907

Open formats, protocols and codecs should not be owned by any company.<p>Most programs manipulate data in some way. Open formats let you switch from one program to another without losing your data. It opens up opportunities for paid, free or SaaS solutions and users can choose whatever suits them best. For most people, their concern is about their data: what happens if they stop using program x which manipulates their data in a proprietary file format.<p>PDF is a good example of this - once a proprietary file format, it is now an open standard. There are dozens, if not hundreds of free and paid-for programs that let you create, edit, view or save PDF files.

The trouble is that they don&#x27;t understand just how wide-ranging human thoughts and feelings can be, and assume they will understand and be able to model based on the diff, even if the diff is larger than their whole mind.<p>It&#x27;s why geeks keep coming up with &quot;intuitively obvious&quot; schemes no-one else can understand, and why engineers are <i>routinely</i> surprised at what actual end users do with their products in user testing.<p>So people write new languages that suit their personal peculiar ways of thinking. Thankfully, many are quite aware that this is what they are doing and don&#x27;t claim universality.<p>This is why Urbit is art: translating numbers and ASCII characters into nonsense syllables that you are actually expected to pronounce and think in suits Yarvin&#x27;s mind, even as it leaves me thinking &quot;there is such a thing as being too much of a Borges fan&quot;. Which is absolutely fine. But this is why Urbit is art (an expression of a unique personal vision), not anything people are actually going to use without similar levels of confusion to the present.<p>For an example of fully rampant Typical Mind Fallacy in Urbit, see the security document: <a href=""http://www.urbit.org/2013/08/22/Chapter-6-security.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbit.org/2013/08/22/Chapter-6-security.html</a> About two-thirds of the way down, you can actually see Yarvin transform into Moldbug and start pontificating on how humans communicating on a network <i>should</i> work, and never mind the observable evidence of how they actually have behaved whenever each of the conditions he describes have obtained. The very first thing people will do with the Urbit system is try to mess with its assumptions, in ways that its creators literally could not foresee (due to Typical Mind Fallacy), though they might have been reasonably expected to (given the real world as data).",1380446673

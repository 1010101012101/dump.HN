People are justifiably retreating to circles of trust, and a well-groomed, jealously defended, authentic 'social graph' is a plausible antidote to all those problems.<p>For example, email was a giant 'aha' when it was young and strong -- but it's dying under the weight of abuse and generational change. Social graph messaging has already replaced email for some people, maybe a whole generation of net users, and social graph messaging might topple (or save!) email in the near future.<p>Of course Facebook isn't the first social network, but it's mostly been doing the right things to be the 'last', the one that you never need to leave because it overlooked a new opportunity or forgot to defend its core trust value.",1207958355
161506,comment,161163,161163,0,0,fendale,,,"This is great news good to see it!<p>What I have been wondering is what happens to the memory footprint?  It says somewhere on the site it is reduced by 33% - is that a typical reduction?<p>Also, if this is like mod_perl, deployment wasn't really as simple as it seemed.  The general advice on mod_perl was to proxy requests from your front end 'static' webserver to the mod_perl one, because each apache process had to effectively run a Perl interpreter, giving them a big memory footprint.  You don't want to use your expensive mod_perl/ruby processes to serve images etc.<p>I also think there are other advantages to running expensive  processes behind a proxy (I may be wrong on this one), but I think that slow clients tend to tied up the front end process as it streams the data to them.<p>If you have appServer -> proxy -> slow client, the app server sends the data to the proxy at LAN speed, freeing it to serve another request, and the proxy ties up a process streaming the data to the client.<p>I am not trying to criticize, I am interested in whether they solved these problems (if they even are problems anymore) and how.",1207958277

161504,comment,161212,161212,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Google isn't about search, Google is all about the infrastructure.  From my perspective, Google's main competitive advantage has never really been their dominance in search.  I've always thought that their main innovations and their chief advantage has been in terms of their infrastructure.<p>Arguably, Google has built the largest distributed computing cluster in the world with proprietary OS and datastore that is finely tuned to run on that cluster.  They just don't advertise these facts too often.  I'm sure that their dataset is easily in the petascale, and I'm sure that a lot of it is running in RAM to achieve the <400 millisecond response times they have.<p>So, compare Google's infrastructure expertise to your $6 hosting account at Wally's Web Host, and I think that you start to see the difference.  Wally might well sell you 15,000 Gb/month of web transfer, but they <i>maybe</i> might be overselling what they can actually provide.  And, how many other web hosts offer to manage fault tolerant database replication for you?  Heck, what's your instance up time at Wally's Web Host?  Last I checked, Google's had 15 minutes of downtime since 2000.<p>With GAE, I Google isn't selling web hosting.  What they are doing is offering to outsource your sys admin duties for free.  The verdict is still out, but I would be interested in seeing the response of apps on GAE to first couple of Slashdottings/Diggings/Boingboings.  I'd venture a guess that they'll handle it rather smoothly, and that the developer running the site will be able to snooze through it, instead of panicking and trying to reboot the server, cache the page in question, or have Apache serve the page as a static file.  Not having to panic each time your server pings your cell phone can only be a good thing for developers.",1207958249

161478,comment,156177,157600,0,0,cturner,,,"The original situation we're discussing is straight-forward and there's no need to delve into bizarre hypotheticals and risk confusing things further.<p><pre><code>   yet arbitrarily* removing opportunities for what you may
   have in the future is perfectly acceptable
</code></pre>
You talk about removing opportunities from people and this is mistaken. In the child situation, nobody has removed opportunity from the child. You have again tried to twist things so as to describe the natural order as being one where all charity options available to help a poor person realise all opportunities are exhausted. You then use the word 'stealing' to describe failure to reach that point. It's flawed and you don't win points for being original in trying it on. [1]<p><pre><code>    I'm not talking about government, I'm talking about
    the morality of poverty itself, specifically in
    children who have no responsibility for their situation.
</code></pre>
But you are, because you're talking about rights, and the idea of a right that cannot be realised is invalid. There are some philosophers who are of the opinion that there is such a thing as a right but where there is no moral obligation upon anything else to guarantee that right. For example - the right to work. In contrast, my opinion is that if philosophers want to masturbate then they should do so in the privacy of their own home and avoid staining their work with it. If there is a right, then it is to be enforced, and if something should not be defended then it is not a right.<p><pre><code>    Suppose you had access to a magic button, and
    pressing it will -- at no cost to anyone -- give
    every child a fair start, where their life's success
    will solely be the product of the wisdom of their
    choices. Is there a moral imperative to press that
    button? Would it be wrong, in the way that theft is
    wrong, to turn your back on it?
</code></pre>
What you're generally asking is an interesting question, but it's not pertinent to this discussion for these reasons:<p>* You've used the word 'fair' and I've already explained that as a worse-than-useless word in a conversation about public policy.<p>* You've mentioned ""at no cost to anyone"" and that's not what we're talking about here and it is a crucial part of the discussion.<p><pre><code>    If yes, then what we end up with is a debate along
    utilitarian lines: At what cost must we address the
    wrongs done to those born into poverty?
</code></pre>
Sure enough - after having claimed that you're not talking about the bridge into coercion through government - you come clean and admit that actually that's exactly what you're doing.<p><pre><code>    If no, well, that is where I throw the 'nasty names'
    around.
</code></pre>
I suspect that this conversation will end in value incompatibility which is a shame, because I suspect if it does then at least one of us is not being entirely honest with self - we seem to both be broadly utilitarian. I think nasty names (which I fall to sometimes as well) are a temptation in two scenarios:<p>* Value clash with the other person, you make a last ditch effort to shame them into converting to your values.<p>* Situation in which you feel yourself having cause to abandon something you hold dearly due to internal incompatibility (e.g. someone who is a both religious and a white supremacist is having trouble reconciling parts of the bible's teaching with the fulfilling feelings they associate with Friday night ceremonies), and you want to pretend that there's a value clash to allow for an easy exit out of the conversation and being able to escape the need to reconcile the incompatibility.<p><pre><code>    p.s. : A total side issue, but I don't see that
    taking stuff off a dead person is ""stealing"" from
    anyone. ;)

The property belongs to them. They leave instructions on what is to be done with it. It is not unowned property, nor is there any doubt about the wishes of the owner in the presence of a will. Therefore doing other with it is stealing. In the absence of a will - well - that's up for debate, but it's not particularly significant in the grand scheme of this discussion.<p>[1] See Hayek's _The Road To Serfdom_. Chapter 2 is particularly useful for exploring this ""characteristic confusion of freedom with power"".",1207956282

Most smart engineers prefer to avoid rejection by spending more time on developing technology or products and they want to get it as perfect as possible before presenting it to a potential user or customer for critique.  This is wrong.  Get over rejection.  Embrace it.  Do it early.  Any chance you can, get in front of people who are not your family or your friends and get real feedback.  You don't learn anything from positive feedback.  Your learn a whole lot more from negative feedback.<p>2) How to develop a sensitivity to other people's inconvenience.

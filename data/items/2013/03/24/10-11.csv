5431698,comment,5430882,5431574,3,0,yareally,,,"Yeah, I'm kind of used to Opera not always working with everything that it does not phase me anymore after 10 years of use. If it's something I need to see Opera won't render, I either hack around it in Opera or just open Chromium. I also understand that Chrome is popular and many of the projects on hn are hacks put together for the developer and to show us what they do for fun and learning versus projects made for the masses, so I give leadway when things don't always work. Sometimes it's just a simple mistake and the developer is glad to fix it (like he did here [updated in the linked article] for anyone that did not have an Apple keyboard). Although we all have our favorites, most of us like to be accommodating if it does not require hours of additional personal time.<p>I have all the large browsers installed though for web development, so I can always open something else if needed. I just can't move away from Opera, because of all the native power features I would have to give up or find extensions that may or may not work exactly the same and have future support by their developers. I can say though that unlike some sites I frequented in the past (such as slashdot), I have never had anyone on HN make snarky remarks about me being an Opera user, which is refreshing and quite the opposite of being excluded.<p>I do think Webkit will help Opera in the long run as well, as long as they do not use it as a reason to throw away their long term commitment they have stuck with to keep backwards support for features and user interface elements. If they ditch most of that on the notion they can just tell users to use Chrome extensions, I would be truly sadden and have little reason to use Opera anymore. I'd probably end up forking Chromium in attempt to make it function like Opera once did and hope other former Opera users would help contribute via code commits along the way. That's just worst case thinking and I'm going to stay optimistic for now :)<p>Not to get too off track though from the discussion, but the OP (above my original reply) is correct in that there is quite a bit of RoR and Apple upvoted articles (if that was his point), but there are many others in a variety of topics. Perhaps not everyone is as interested as I am about broadening my knowledge of various technologies whether I use them or not, but I think many of us on HN are. Since I don't follow RoR or Apple news that much, I don't mind seeing it, because it at least keeps me exposed to information I don't follow actively on my own.",1364122518

5431671,comment,5431409,5431625,1,0,jlgreco,,,"Hmm.  Going from how commits are formatted to include signing, I think it should be possible to strip signatures and re-add them.  This would create a new commit object of course, so if you had multiple commits that needed to be pushed you would have to actually need to re-write the rest of the commits to have different parents...<p>It may not be kosher, and I don't think the porcelain supports it, but I think you could write a remote that only accepts commits if they are all signed by someone on a trusted list.  This would probably mess up a lot of workflows though, since if person A writes some commits, person B rewrites them to sign them and then pushes them to the repo, then when person A pulls the commits ""they"" created they would actually be different commits.<p>If we were willing to take that hit though, I think it should also be possible to modify git to permit multiple signatures on a single commit.  Users could take a signed commit, append their signature too it (well, technically not append.  Signatures are in the middle it seems) and then push it or pass it on to others to sign.  This would only allow a single commit to go through the system at once (since commits after the first would need to be rewritten, invalidating previous signatures) but on the other hand it would let you create an integration server that only accepts commits that have been signed by some number of trusted code-reviewers, while still keeping all of that information in git.

Back when I was in high school, of the Dunthorpe kids that went to public schools, half went to Wilson High School and half went to Lake Oswego, both of which good schools. Then the Oregon legislature passed some law that required that primary schools feed into secondary schools in the same district, so Dunthorpe renovated an old grade school and made Riverdale High School. It's tiny - I just checked the Wikipedia page [1] and it only has 131 students and Riverdale is the 3rd wealthiest school district in the country (who says Open Source doesn't pay?).<p>I mention all this because as far as public schools go, it's an outlier among outliers. So comparing it to schools in Minnesota or elsewhere goes beyond the normal case of poor school districts vs. wealthy ones.<p>Plus, in Oregon at least, school funding does not correlate well with student performance. The Portland School District has higher per pupil funding than most of the suburbs, and yet it consistently under performs many of them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverdale_High_School_%28Portland,_Oregon%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverdale_High_School_%28Portla...</a>",1364121336

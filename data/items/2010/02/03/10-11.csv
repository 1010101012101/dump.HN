1097478,comment,1097188,1097188,0,0,coffeemug,,,"In the case of startups I think that there are two issues to be aware of. The first is that (in my experience) most early stage startups are severely underfunded. After the dot com bust (back then the startups were severely overfunded) the investors swung back to a different extreme. So don't jump to conclusions and blame the founders - I think most founders are trying to do the best they can with the resources at hand.<p>The second issue is how the founder presents the situation to potential employees. I was once offered 10,000 options by what's considered to be a very successful startup. When I politely mentioned that this figure is meaningless and that I need to know the percentage of the company it represents in order to properly evaluate the offer, the founder said that ""investors don't like giving away this information - I promise you that it's enough that you'll become a millionaire"". If you're in a situation like that where the management has no respect for your time, I'd say run. But if they're honest about why the salary is lower than average, well, it's really up to you.<p>I think in general the economics works out because it's easy for investors (and in turn, founders) to prey on young, gullible people who have a romanticized idea of the startup scene and potential returns. If you look at the statistics, the expected value is just bad, and young inexperienced people generally aren't able to properly evaluate it. So investors put in too little money because enough people are willing to work for pizza and beer, and in turn employees are underpaid because enough people are willing to work for less in exchange for the ""startup experience"". It's a crappy situation, but like with most things in the world, I'd say don't worry about fighting battles that aren't worth fighting. If you're clever enough to realize this, work for Wall Street or Microsoft - in my experience you'll find much smarter people there than in most startups anyway.<p>Regarding Google underpaying engineers, in my opinion it doesn't jibe with their ""don't be evil"" mantra. They really should know better.",1265194523

On a tangent: does anyone here know of techniques or algorithms for verifying that a lock-free or obstruction-free algorithm works? Ideally some that can actually be applied in practice. So far I've been manually trying out all possible scheduling combinations, which is very tedious and can be error prone on larger algorithms. It's also not clear if doing the analysis for 2 concurrent threads automatically extends to 3 or more (it clearly does for some algorithms).<p>I've been thinking along the lines of a DSL for such algorithms that can compile down to whatever language you need, but also easily lends itself to static analysis for verification, but I feel my lack of classical CompSci training is letting me down here a bit.",1265194020

1097456,comment,1097188,1097292,0,0,pmjordan,,,"There's a crucial difference between writing open source software for free and getting a badly paid job, though. With open source software, nobody is making you do it. Okay, you might have users who you feel compelled to please, but let's face it, you don't have any contractual obligations.<p>Contrast this with something like a game tester. These are some of the hardest working people I've ever met, and they often earn so little they have to live with their parents. (with all the unpaid overtime, I'm sure they get less than minimum wage) They don't really get a choice about whether to work the 80 hour week they're asked to: if they choose to work less, they'll probably be passed over for the promotion to lead QA or level designer. (for the latter they have to build their skills in that field in their spare time) My understanding is that it's similar in film, etc. This happens even above the entry level: I once met an animator who accepted a 90% (!) pay cut to give up his job at a Hollywood animation studio and work for Rockstar London, just because Rockstar have this aura of prestige.<p>Initially, this strategy might make sense to get your foot in the door. But I'd be extremely surprised if it was optimal once you'd proven yourself to the company. I'd have been pushing for much higher pay if I was still in a regular job (though maybe the drastic difference in skill between programmers makes this easier than in artsier jobs where productivity is even harder to gauge). Yet the culture bred in the game industry is such that you're supposed to feel privileged to be working there in the first place. As far as I can tell, this is an illusion; it's not actually that hard to get a job, at least not once you have a minimum of experience. (this culture is one of the reasons I left; the fact that they attempted to bribe me to stay reinforces my belief - I've been getting more than what they offered as a contractor)",1265192793

I wake up at 5:30 and get to work at 7:00 and until 7:00 I prepare my childs and my day and read a little news while coffeeing. I work until 6:00 (at least) and when I'm home theres I child and wife waiting for me. My day ends up at around 10 or 11.

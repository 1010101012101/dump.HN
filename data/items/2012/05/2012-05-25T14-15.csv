People have to think and reason about it.<p>If I purchase stock in a company one week at $33/share, and the next week that same stock is trading at $23/share, it is highly unlikely that the stock was worth what I paid for it, unless something unforeseeable happened to that company during that week which dropped its value by nearly a third. Market capitalization is only an estimate of real value. The only reason the stock market tends to do such a good job of estimating it, is that so many people are doing their homework before deciding to purchase a share.<p>Articles like this and discussions like this are critical to a healthy market.

For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have ""lost"". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.""<p><a href=""http://www.towel.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.towel.org.uk/</a>",1337955590

The more parsimonious explanation is that genes (being the primary mechanism of propagating traits between generations) are the unit of replication, and closely-related kin have much higher gene similarity than arbitrarily-sized groups (due to the mutation/genetic drift that occurs all the time). Natural selection can only operate on replicators, and genetic replicators only create kin.

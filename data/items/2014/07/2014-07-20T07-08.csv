The government has just cut 14-25% off the rates they&#x27;ll pay with their &quot;bedroom tax&quot; policy, hoping that people will reallocate themselves to properties more efficiently.  But after a year of the policy being in effect, 60% of people affected are in arrears with their rent, i.e. most people have just stayed put and hoped for the best.<p>I&#x27;m not sure benefit fraud is as prevalent as you state - a TUC survey from a couple of years suggest it&#x27;s usually overestimated: <a href=""http://www.tuc.org.uk/social-issues/child-poverty/welfare-and-benefits/tax-credits/support-benefit-cuts-dependent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tuc.org.uk/social-issues/child-poverty/welfare-an...</a>",1405842901

They can discount loans and other assets of banks or other private depository institutions, thereby converting potentially illiquid private assets into riskless claims on the government in the form of deposits at the central bank.<p>That all of these claims on government are readily accepted reflects the fact that a government cannot become insolvent with respect to obligations in its own currency. A fiat money system, like the ones we have today, can produce such claims without limit. To be sure, if a central bank produces too many, inflation will inexorably rise as will interest rates, and economic activity will inevitably be constrained by the misallocation of resources induced by inflation. If it produces too few, the economy’s expansion also will presumably be constrained by a shortage of the necessary lubricant for transactions. Authorities must struggle continuously to find the proper balance.&quot;<p>Alan Greenspan",1405841528

Unlike any other western country, the government prints their own money debt free and can thus just bail out all the bad loans forever.&quot;<p>wow, it has been a very long time since I read anything remotely as economically ignorant and facile as this statement.<p>for one, the implication that the Chinese hold US debt and that they in turn are not borrowers is categorically false.<p>second, the Chinese hold less than 7% of the US debt but if you listen to the general media and commentators it sounds like it is more like 70%. The fact is that the vast majority of the US debt is held by the Federal Reserve.<p>Credit bubbles, like every other economic bubble is disastrous because it is a gross mis-allocation of resources. The piper shall not be denied. He is a hellish collector that will break every bone in your body if you don&#x27;t pay. But the thing is, he&#x27;s a bit unpredictable because you never know exactly when he&#x27;ll knock on your door to collect. But knock he will.<p>May I respectfully suggest that before you attempt to comment on something as complex as macroeconomics you take at least a single course in the discipline?",1405840353

My father, of Lebanese descent, moved from Lebanon in the 50s.  He had stories about Yemen from way back when.  One example was that an eye for an eye was still the norm there - a boy smashed out the eye of a cow with a rock in a morbid attempt at fun, and the owner of the cow did the same to the boy.  This punishment was accepted in the village where this occurred.",1405839605

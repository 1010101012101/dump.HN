4841895,comment,4840807,4841832,4,0,laumars,,,"I don't think you've really read through the points I was raising as the vast majority of them were relating to hiding server based information from unauthorised users and preventing brute force attacks. Neither of those two have any impact on usability what-so-ever (that is, unless your 'user' is an attacker lol).<p>If you don't mind, I will address your points individually:<p>""Changes that give you relatively little gain from a security point of view at the cost of massive usability. I'd be happy to run production servers without these changes, and so I claim that these are debatable.""<p>Which items specifically prevents usability? None of them do aside the FTP (but SFTP is supported by nearly every FTP client already) and turning off PHP error logging to STDOUT (really <i>not</i> recommended for production servers!). Everything else doesn't reduce usability for authorised users. And I resent the claim that there's little gain as even on my servers which have a low public profile, I get reports of multiple brute force attacks a week (on average, about separate 5 attacks a week, all of which I manually add to a permanent firewall blacklist when it becomes obvious that they're just retrying attacks everytime fail2ban's autoban expires).<p>""Changes that stop inexperienced admins accidentally compromising their servers, at the cost of usability/complexity. Debatable because they're less about security and more about not shooting yourself in the foot. Eg. fail2ban. I use ssh keys only. Brute forcing my ssh won't work, and I'd prefer to not allow outsiders to cause firewall rule changes on my servers based on a script that parses log strings with regular expressions. I trust ssh's security more than I trust fail2ban in not having a vulnerability.""<p>You don't understand how fail2ban works if that's your primary concern. Fail2ban isn't public facing, it just monitors logs and then adds an iptables (or any firewall you chose) rules based on the results of the log files. It's iptables that is public facing and thus needs to be protected against vunrabilities; and iptables is proven technology already. What's more, preventing brute force attacks doesn't reduce usability nor prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot; preventing brute force attacks is the !!<i>bare</i> <i>minimum</i>!! you need to do if you have an internet facing server. This is security 101! I do agree with you that SSH keys are preferable to password log ins, but that also adds complexity and can reduce usability if users need access from multiple locations and platforms (there are workarounds, eg memory stick with the key on), and then you still have the issue of brute force attacks on every other log in service.<p>""This is pretty much what AppArmor hardening does. LXC (Linux containers) are implmented via AppArmor. A compromised httpd daemon restricted in this way won't be able to much anyway (eg. open outbound ports or go to other areas of the filesystem). And this is what Ubuntu ships by default for many daemons.""<p>You missed the point about easy snapshotting though, which is why I raised the point about containers in the 1st place. I will grant you that you can have back up solutions on bare metal systems, but snapshotting is way more usable (which is ironic given that's been your key argument). Plus I did say that advice was for the paranoid (ie not really all that necessary unless you fancy tinkering).<p>""Nowadays this stuff is only installed if you requested it, which is different from ""ship""ing it. If you use distribution defaults, you won't have an FTP server installed. If you choose to install one, you'll get the weakness whether you use the distribution, tune it yourself or install from a third party source.""<p>You're just reiterating what I said though as I didn't say distributions install it by default. However you missed my point there as well, as I was describing how FTP isn't ideal for production systems (FTP sends clear text passwords and doesn't behave itself behind firewalls and/or NATing without adaptive routing (which means that FTPS often doesn't work behind some firewalls).). Thus chrooted SFTP is a much saner solution for production systems.<p>""Secure enough for production. I have plenty of servers on distribution defaults that haven't been compromised (and I have experience in dealing with others' servers when they have been compromised, so I don't think I'm oblivious). You may prefer adding additional hardening, but it is unnecessary and relies on you knowing what you are doing.""<p>You've been lucky. But what your advocating is little more than 'security by obscurity' rather than pro-actively hardening your box. Having worked on a number of high profile web infrastructures (including farms that take web payments), I wouldn't be doing my job if I ignored my steps; in fact our business wouldn't exist as we would break UK laws.<p>The Apache configuration I described is ridiculously easy to set up, as is fail2ban. They are the bare minimum any web server should implement. Which is why I placed emphasis on them by placing those suggestions at the top of my post. However if we're going to advocate complacency in order to make our lives easy, then lets also not bother keeping our software up to date, because that's a real pain in the arse at times :p",1354099709

The Fed is aiming its unlimited buying power \n  (since it can literally create money) at the market for \n  mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the pools of mortgages \n  where nearly all American home loans eventually end up. And \n  the one of the largest holders of these MBS are the banks.\n</code></pre>\nSpeaking of rails, California is still building a $68 billion train to nowhere. The state will still declare bankruptcy within years, Prop. 30 or no Prop 30. Most of the people entering CA are not YC founders, but rather high school dropouts, and most of the people and companies leaving are net taxpayers.<p>Further taxes will only increase this exodus. All of Prop 30's projected revenue is based on the fallacious idea that smart, high-earning people are stationary targets.

They can be divided into two groups:<p>1) Changes that give you relatively little gain from a security point of view at the cost of massive usability. I'd be happy to run production servers without these changes, and so I claim that these are debatable.<p>2) Changes that stop inexperienced admins accidentally compromising their servers, at the cost of usability/complexity. Debatable because they're less about security and more about not shooting yourself in the foot. Eg. fail2ban. I use ssh keys only. Brute forcing my ssh won't work, and I'd prefer to not allow outsiders to cause firewall rule changes on my servers based on a script that parses log strings with regular expressions. I trust ssh's security more than I trust fail2ban in not having a vulnerability.<p>> And lastly, if you're really paranoid, run your webserver inside a Linux/UNIX container<p>This is pretty much what AppArmor hardening does. LXC (Linux containers) are implmented via AppArmor. A compromised httpd daemon restricted in this way won't be able to much anyway (eg. open outbound ports or go to other areas of the filesystem). And this is what Ubuntu ships by default for many daemons.<p>> Also many distributions ship FTP, which is insecure by default.<p>Nowadays this stuff is only installed if you requested it, which is different from ""ship""ing it. If you use distribution defaults, you won't have an FTP server installed. If you choose to install one, you'll get the weakness whether you use the distribution, tune it yourself or install from a third party source.<p>> In short; distribution's don't ship secure defaults. They ship a happy medium between usability and security. However if you have an internet facing box (particularly one not hidden behind a hardware firewall, as many budget set ups are not), then the happy medium isn't secure enough.<p>Secure enough for production. I have plenty of servers on distribution defaults that haven't been compromised (and I have experience in dealing with others' servers when they have been compromised, so I don't think I'm oblivious). You may prefer adding additional hardening, but it is unnecessary and relies on you knowing what you are doing.<p>Finally, you've missed my biggest point. For someone new to running servers on the Internet, who can he trust for guidance? You, me, a random guide on the Internet or a distribution vendor?",1354098329

4841789,comment,4839502,4840243,3,0,josephlord,,,"There are two non technical differences that I think are worth knowing about.  Both are good frameworks although Rails is probably quicker to get started with I suspect it may be harder to become really advanced in.<p>1) Stability vs Development Speed<p>The Rails (and it seems Ruby) attitude seems to be that fairly frequent compatibility breaking changes are OK.  Bundler and a well managed Gemfile (and probably RVM too) allow you to progress at a slower rate on any Gems that haven't been updated.<p>The Django (and Python) world seems much more careful about not making breaking changes.  In other comments this thread the slow deprecation of old Pythons in Django is mentioned.  For Python itself Python 3 was I think regarded as the one chance to break things before locking down compatibility to not change very much going forwards.<p>2) Documentation<p>I find the Rails Documentation pretty poor at the details such as explaining exactly what all the valid options are and their effects.  Links to the source are often given in the API docs but there are often so many layers of indirection to drill though to find what options are actually supported that the value is limited.  There are plenty of examples (e.g. Railscasts) to copy and learn from to get you going on hundreds of different topics but you need these resources to guide you through the massive universe.<p>Django is more traditionally thoroughly documented but without the really quick 'get something running in 10 minutes' guides.  I think once you get proficient you could just look up what you need and it is all there for you but there is quite a lot to learn at the start.<p>So in my view:\nRails - quick start, learn by examples, lean on package management systems heavily.\nDjango - slightly slower start, properly documented in the details, stable long term platforms.",1354097240

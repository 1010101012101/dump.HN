Facebook has all of a person's friends, and so it kind of covers the thought leaders for that person to some extent. Twitter has the world's thought leaders, people whose views are very highly valued - see the AP getting hacked causing a noticeable drop in the world's markets for example.<p>Reddit is a bit trickier. It has a lot of localised power - for example the live Boston bombers article was lightyears ahead of the media. It pretty much drove the media wave trying to initially determine who they were. It even has the world's thought leaders dropping in (Obama IAMA). But I think it really lacks the power to consistently put thought leaders in front of people. It's easy to argue it's a stronger community, but I don't think the average social network consumer really cares about the overall community.",1367762332

They may have a small clientele that they cater to exclusively and personally.<p>As far as I can see, you really need VPS if you need that amount of flexibility. The only person you can count on to keep your stack up-to-date in the end is you. If you do it, you know what you did. All the host needs to do is make sure someone else's VM doesn't affect yours and bandwidth and power are taken care of.<p>Running a VPS is an order of magnitude simpler than managing individual software packages/libraries, conflicts and such per client and so you will generally get better service as a result anyway. ""Here's a bucket. Do with it what you please (just nothing illegal or resource hogging)."" Then you just have to worry about the time you spend on keeping your VPS up to date.<p>VPS packages are reaching the same cost that shared hosts had a little while back and if AWS isn't an option for whatever reason, it's the better pick.<p>Edit: I should mention that I use two different hosts. One reseller and one VPS. The reseller on shared is for users who need the nice admin interface for everything, ""one-click"" installs, DB admin GUI etc... and the VPS for personal stuff and a couple of clients.",1367762287

I was elbowing my way through a very busy bar area (it was early and I had just started drinking) and eventually there was a person in front of me who started going to the left just when I went left, and vice versa, as often happens when you walk in a crowded place. After a few left/right attempts I suddenly realized that the person was, in fact, myself, and that I had reached a mirror that covered the entire end of the room. (The bar's bouncer was standing behind me and had watched the whole thing and was laughing very hard.)<p>The thing is, since I did not <i>expect</i> to see myself, I did not recognize myself.

5658331,comment,5658184,5658184,13,0,alanctgardner2,,,"Having worked at (and briefly managed) a local computer store, then a big box store, it's a brutal business. In the small store we made all our money on service: selling recycled commodity boxes was a way to get traffic through the door, so you could fix them later. A few high-end builds were the highlight of my year, but they were few and far between. We considered offering Linux, but:<p>- It used to be that most technical people ( and some non-technical) would buy desktops. You can sidestep the Windows tax and attendant issues by building a desktop (from parts you know work well with Linux), and maybe hit a competitive price in the high end. Now that desktops are a tiny sliver of the market, these stores are enslaved by OEMs, reboxing existing laptop designs.<p>- Starting from the same wholesale price, Linux resellers 'add value' by installing Linux. But this value-add isn't really apparent to a large enough audience - there isn't enough public awareness, and people aren't willing to pay a premium. Especially if they're competent enough to install Linux themselves. In my experience people expect ANY OS to be free; when we used to try and sell Win XP as an upgrade (over 2K), people were aghast that the software cost money.<p>- People want free support if you sell them on Linux. If they nuke the system, you either scare them off with your hourly service rate, or you eat the cost of the labour and go broke.<p>- So the vendor either charges a higher sticker price and doesn't sell many, or eats the labour cost for developing Linux support, fixing and reboxing laptops and tries to make up the tiny (or even negative) gross margin on volume.<p>When I moved to a bigger chain store, they subsidized the low-margin laptop market by aggressively pushing house-brand accessories: cables, cases, blank media, printer ink. These small stores are typically much less aggressive about selling high-margin commodities along with a system (it's harder to do with less capital, space and by mail).<p>So it isn't a problem of freedom and choice. It isn't a problem of Microsoft crushing little independents (not consciously). The computer business is very hard to do well at small scale, and you should expect that on a medium time-scale most will die. This is only exacerbated by the rush to laptops, then tablets and smartphones, where it's impossible to differentiate.",1367761841

However, it's easy to forget that during the postwar boom years, a major shift toward cars happened and it took a concerted effort of willful resistance and politically non-expedient measures to bring back the bike paths (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuBdf9jYj7o"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuBdf9jYj7o</a>).  Clearly, 1897 was not the last chance the Dutch had to fix their transit system, and with the groundwork they've laid over the years, it now costs only 30 per person in funding annually!

This obviously is a political no-go considering that motorists are by far the majority demographic.  It's saddening, though, that there is so much willful ignorance (or apathy) with regard to how we've externalized the true cost of driving, whether it's in the form of:<p>- damage to the environment<p>- subsidy to cheap gas prices by the DoD budget (and body count) for controlling the world's oil flow<p>- casualties from motor vehicle accidents<p>- health problems resulting from sedentary lifestyles<p>- zoning rules that require abundant free parking to be available in communities.<p>We'd probably have to see gas hit $10/gallon and parking lots charge $50/day before Americans start to reconsider.  (These prices are actually quite typical in European cities.)<p>Oddly enough, I think it's good that the Great Recession has caused a lot of Americans to reconsider their car expenses and choose to scale back their lifestyles in ways that are more healthy, safe, and environmentally friendly.  I hope this trend (not the recession, of course) continues and if America can set an example of moving away from a car culture, it will do far more good around the world to discourage the growing middle class in China, India, and other developing countries from adopting the same wasteful practices.<p>In the meantime, though, I'll piggyback on the 40-year head start on bicycle infrastructure in the Netherlands.

While UIKit is going to draw using OpenGL anyway with this case you're missing a big optimisation in being able do batch drawing of the tiles and using VBO's etc.<p>UIKit is fantastic for normal UI's and the 'general case' but almost certainly isnt optimised for doing efficient drawing of a large number of sprites / tiles (trading efficiency for flexibility).<p>Couple years ago I actually wrote my own API compatible version of UIKit but backed by OpenGL , and then extended support for these type of cases. As it was basically a drop in replacement I was able to confirm UIKit (at least at the time) was not very clever or fast when it came to a large view hierarchy. So my fraemwork was optimising for large batch drawing from a single texture mostly which is what you really want in the OP's case.<p>I should release it one day as open source.. though is all OpenGL 1 so a little outdated on iOS these days.",1367760896

It never did, and was broken up as we know the free market does not solve everything.<p>In this situation, you could argue the market would create a viable alternative, but Microsoft has a consistent track record of influencing the market monopolistically.",1367758926

If you can eat with almost zero effort, you will probably not put any more effort in anything. Tropical countries are very much influenced by this.",1367758917

Other factors -- such as whether institutions are inclusive (targeting the welfare of the entire population) or exploitative (transferring wealth towards a small elite) -- simply matter more.",1367758834

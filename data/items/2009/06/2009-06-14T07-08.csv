I've run VPC on Mac (I bought PVC with office 2004 for my G5), but this leave a <i>LOT</i> to be desired. I'd rather avoid the virtualization. the only success I've had with virtualization is with Xen. Other virtualization attempts (VMWare and MS VPC) has failed for performance and driver reasons. This could very well be different on the X86 architecture, hence why I'm asking for advice.",1244966270

   x is the set of features that all the members of the Lisp family share

   Clojure has all features in x
</code></pre>
then this is trivially true and not surprising.<p>But if you compare the specific language and implementation called Clojure with, say, the specific implementation Clozure CL (CCL), then I would say that there are quite a few features (and their benefits) of CCL that are both available in a lot of other Lisps (for example direct support for object-oriented programming or the ability to save and restart the state) that Clojure lacks. Also true, Clojure has a few features (especially features that are not widely shared among Lisps like STM) that CCL lacks.",1244965782

You have to remember that each car represents the hard work of many people, and I know that if I was the last person in that chain responsible for preparing the demo model for the CEO, I'd certainly take the time to make sure everything was perfect!<p>In fact, I think the author buried the lead in the last paragraph. I've never been turned off of a car because of a loose fitting joint on the dash, or a persistent rattle (my current car has both). Rather, the real problem is that they've removed the human element from the design process. I can't find the exact quote at the moment, but I recall Jonathan Ive once said something to the effect that he could pin-point when each car manufacturer moved from clay model prototypes to CAD design, because that's precisely when the cars lost their ""soul"".",1244965286

I can definitely see that video games could be twice as big as music by 2011, but I just don't see music getting ""smaller"" just video games getting ""bigger."" There are problems with the music industry that will be fixed over time.

Entry-level office jobs require a piece of paper saying ""this dude knows calculus""; they don't actually require the knowledge.

I've played around with various flavors of windows from '95, NT 4 to 2000, XP and server 2003. Also played around with linux flavors, focusing on Slackware, Redhat then fedora core and now Debian.<p>I just bought a Macbook pro (base 15"" model). For my work I need to develop platform specific software for all 3 major platforms (Linux, OS X, Windows XP (thankfully our IT staff has deferred Vista.  )), in addition to server software which will run on Linux for production.<p>So I'm reading through the Apple bootcamp docs and looking over my web searches for tutorials and info on triple booting Leopard, Debian and Windows XP. Do any of you work with this kind of configuration and what suggestions do you have?<p>I'm assuming that I'm going to just scrub my factory install and create four partitions (one for each OS, and one win32 for share)<p>The thing I'm concerned with the most is dealing with weirdness in maintaining the configuratino.
Any advice is appreciated.

5657379,comment,5656249,5657015,2,0,Houshalter,,,">The supply of labor exceeds demand right now which sends the price to 0<p>That's not quite how prices work. There is always a demand for labor. If the price of labor fell low enough there would be plenty of jobs. Though no one would want to work at those wages, it's even illegal to do so. The point is just that the price will never really fall to zero, even if it gets low.<p>>If everybody stops working, the price of services skyrockets. But the problem (soaring cost of services) and the solution (soaring reward for labor) are one and the same. This is how the free market is supposed to work. In fact, I'd go so far to say that BI presents a closer approximation to a free market than the system we have now (where the government price-controls labor).<p>That's not the intention of guaranteed minimum income at all, and not a good thing either. You are just cutting off one place (higher prices) to feed the other (higher wages). At least if I understand what you mean correctly, which I'm not sure. But the idea of the system is that it will balance out wealth disparities over time, but not too unfairly on people who do succeed. As well as provide a safety net. And get rid of all the bad incentives and complications created by other systems which attempt to do the same.",1367725519

Well I could share statistics which clearly show a major rise in violent crime by urban youth in the 90s, with a major decline afterwards, and there could be several explanations for that.<p>As for ""ghetto culture"" - I am referring to the statistics on single mothers / teen mothers in urban ghetto neighborhoods, and the amount of violence, drug use and drug dealing and done by chronically unemployed males who are feeling disenfranchised and without a purpose. Note that poverty by itself is not the main factor - the same neighborhoods before welfare (50-60 years ago) which retained similar demographics in terms of race saw far leas of either one of these phenomena. The culture was certainly different, with a greater emphasis on productive labor, two parent households, and responsibility. And I say all this to show the diminishing returns from welfare, because the welfare class will be expanding to include more and more people as automation takes over.<p>But on a more positive note:

We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</i><p>and then he proceeds to conclude that because google separates  the notion of ""personal information"" and ""sensitive personal information"", and the latter is covered by the ""opt-in consent"" clause above, that must mean that the former (plain ""personal information"") must be sharable because consent is assumed.<p>Logically that doesn't follow at all, since the base assumption would be that they don't share personal information unless it falls under one of the listed exceptions, and just because one ""consent"" has ""opt-in"" in front of it, does not mean that any other ""consent"" means some kind of assumed consent. If the words ""opt-in"" had never appeared, there would be no reason to guess otherwise.<p>What's worse, that line appears to be the sole source of information for him (and no one else came in to discuss it), so that becomes the authoritative line, without a caveat about how he arrived at that conclusion (though, luckily, a link to the ""discussion"" of that line). The site also says Hugo Roy is an ""Economic Law student"" in Paris, but his reading of those terms doesn't sound legal in the EU even if that was the correct conclusion.<p>One great thing about this project is that it's something no old media company would have ever attempted, through worries about liabilities, or fear of offending corporate partners, or just a perceived lack of interest from their viewers. It will hopefully be a great way for the actual users of the internet to keep companies accountable. On the other hand, if somehow an old media company <i>had</i> written about this, many would have consulted an expert (and possibly google themselves) before making that kind of sweeping conclusion. The EFF would have too. Hopefully participation can increase in this project so it's not just one guy's reading of a bunch of ToSs.

9588278,comment,9587566,9588231,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Not all that much once you take into account that &#x27;high risk&#x27; merchants will pay more to the credit card companies as well and typically tend to eat quite a bit of their income due to all kinds of fines (charge-backs for instance) which are assigned fairly arbitrarily.<p>Solutions such as VBV and meticulous logging can take care of this but are hard to implement in a bullet proof way to stand up in case of a dispute. The processors do a good job of this and in general are the more solid component of the eco-system.<p>The only time the costs are excessive is when a processor goes belly-up, which has happened twice for a large enough processor that it affected thousands of merchants.<p>Retail stores are at a huge advantage here because they have inherent address verification and a signature upon delivery, whereas most - if not all - adult sites operate entirely in the virtual domain. That <i>does</i> make it much easier for them to absorb the extra costs.",1432303115

9588276,comment,9583843,9586172,0,0,murbard2,,,"No, all, including the USD, gold or what have you are subject to P+e attacks. Currencies are consensus, and you can, in theory, bribe a majority of people to turn against that consensus at no cost.<p>So for instance, I could print a lot of bills and call them dollar2, and go to everyone in the world - except Bill Gates, and say:<p>&quot;Hey, I have this new currency, it&#x27;s the dollar2. Tell you what, I&#x27;ll give you a dollar2 for every dollar you have. I&#x27;m going to do that to everyone except Bill Gates. I don&#x27;t like him, so I&#x27;m going to keep half of his share of the dollar2, and burn the other half. Here&#x27;s the catch, you have to commit to only recognizing dollar2 as the real currency for the next week. If I succeed, you&#x27;ll be a little richer because of the deflationary effect of burning half of Bill Gate&#x27;s share of dollars. If I don&#x27;t succeed, you can go back to using the dollar, and I&#x27;ll pay you a dollar for your trouble.&quot;<p>So in a very narrow, restricted way, the &quot;rational&quot; thing to do is to go along with this plan, and there we go, the dollar have been taken over. Obviously, such a plan would never work, but it&#x27;s similar to the arguments against most proof-of-stake or even proof-of-work systems.",1432303111

9588137,comment,9587947,9587947,0,0,kaolinite,,,"This really saddens me. I used to love Uber, it was one of my favourite companies. I remember when I first used it - I&#x27;d gone down to London and was going to try UberLux out, just for the one trip. I ended up using it about four times that day, even though it was far more expensive than a taxi. It was incredible and worth every penny because unlike taxis, Uber was professional[1]. The driver was polite, you got a bottle of water to drink and there was stuff to read too (and not rubbish either, quality stuff like the FT).<p>For a while, it seemed like Uber was about the high-end - as Travis himself said, he created Uber to have a more &quot;baller&quot; way to travel around San Francisco - but then they started to care more and more about being seen as affordable and UberX is now clearly the company&#x27;s top priority. And as prices drop and margins are squeezed, articles like this are the end result. People will complain that luxury isn&#x27;t important (and they might be right) but Uber had a really good service that was different. Now they&#x27;re just like all the other ride sharing companies.<p>I really, really wish they would shut down UberX. I know they won&#x27;t. But I want to love Uber again - but with all of these stories, almost all regarding UberX drivers - I feel obnoxious if I use them. I don&#x27;t want to support them.<p>Love the service, hate the company.<p>[1] I was recently in a taxi where the taxi driver said a number of very racist things, directly insulted me, my fellow passenger and pretty much anyone he came into contact with during the ride (other cars, pedestrians, etc) and swore repeatedly. This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve experienced this (although it was the worst). I&#x27;m somewhat shy and find taxis to be, on occasion, somewhat intimidating. I&#x27;ve never felt that way in an Uber.",1432301720

An engaged, friendly IT department can help grease the skids for an enterprise sale; a hostile one can scupper it.<p>It&#x27;s true, but I think it depends somewhat on the product and space, right?  &quot;Enterprise software&quot; can encompass a wide variety of tech, from SAP on one end, to database and app platforms in another direction, to marketing tech in a third, and so on.<p>If you&#x27;re running on-premise, IT has to be involved.  If you&#x27;re touching IT-provided services like email, file sharing, etc, IT has to be involved.  But if you&#x27;re not touching IT centrally, they&#x27;re often not involved, beyond the validation points about security, etc.   In the space in which I currently work, for example, IT is almost never involved.  In a previous life selling application and infrastructure management products, IT was almost always the direct customer/implementor.  There&#x27;s a huge spread, so I think everyone has to be clear about which scenarios we&#x27;re talking about.<p>> I think this is partly down to a certain amount of skepticism regarding salespeople&#x27;s promises.<p>Sometimes I think it&#x27;s skepticism, I think it&#x27;s also that IT orgs tend to have a longer history with the concept of &quot;partnering&quot; with a vendor, which often involves a combination of skepticism, optimism, professional services, and a willingness to settle.  When you deal with a different business unit that maybe has less experience with building and implementing Product, sometimes they don&#x27;t see/embrace that approach.<p>>  think that&#x27;s a little bit harsh (but not necessarily untrue!).

This is an important part of the discussion because if they start telling them what the can and cannot do during their time then they start to look more and more like employees (something they absolutely do not want).<p>An example of this are the popularly discussed drivers that run jewellery or other businesses out of their car while also driving. The moment Uber says you cannot do this on while a contractor for us the legal waters become murkier.<p>It may be the case that once someone challenges in court an Uber driver (not Uber itself) and wins on the grounds that not accepting a disabled passenger is illegal then the company will have the grounds (and precedent) to enforce that their contractors do not break the law.<p>To drive the point home, even if Uber wants to prevent their drivers from doing certain things doing so moves them closer to the realm of employees not contractors.<p>Edit: To clarify I don&#x27;t necessarily believe that Uber drivers should be considered contractors, but until a case is brought against them and they lose and all drivers become employees they&#x27;re going to be as hands off as possible to maintain their ability  to defend the position.

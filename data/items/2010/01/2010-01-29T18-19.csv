The iPad removes all those frustrations, and in the process closes itself to tinkering, and I think that's an acceptable switch.<p>Other machines will exist to tinker on. Moreover, the iPad itself is opening to tinkering. If I'm a young kid who finds out online I can download a jailbreaker and completely hack up my iPad, that's exciting for me! That gives me an opening into the world of tinkering and fiddling that you have with these computers by default. Or, if I have an idea for how to excite people into learning how to fiddle with computers, I make an iPad app or a webapp that teaches them all those things. As I said in the article: If nobody else decides that would be an awesome thing to do, chances are I'll make one myself, for my own sake as much as for others'.<p>I understand the criticism that the iPad's getting for being closed. I've been a member here for however long. And to some degree, I sympathize with it. But people here are fucking ridiculous. (Not just here; Reddit and MetaFilter are just as bad.)

However, that's what my labor was worth to my superiors, and they knew their business better than did the USG.<p>You make two assumptions with your comment.  One is that everybody making minimum wage is supporting a family of four.  I have sympathy for those people.  Pricing them out of a job, however, is simply cruel.  They need to increase the value of their skill with experience or education.  And what better way to do that than to make less than they want for a period of time so that they can build up one or both of those.<p>Which brings me to your other assumption -- people who make a low wage will always make a low wage.  I now make many times over that $4 per hour.  That job enabled me to get another job which enabled me to get another job, etc.  I wasn't doing what I do now, but every job had in common the attribute that I had to make myself worth what I was being paid, whether that's $4 per hour or $100.  Every day I use experience gained at each of those jobs, even the most miserable ones.<p>There was a story on HN a while ago about a guy with an MBA who now works at Publix.  He had been laid off and claimed that he wanted to teach his sons that work was dignified no matter the job.  I believe he was being paid $8/hour or so.  Publix has no choice but to pay him $8/hour because he likely can't do a much better job at bagging groceries than the 16 year-old next to him whose labor has been assigned that value by politicians who have never run a grocery store.  If Publix wasn't forced to pay the teenager a higher wage than he's likely worth, Publix could either hire more teenagers and reduce everyone's workload and provide the customer a better experience, or they could pay the teen $4/hr and the father $12/hr.<p>That may enable the father to work there a little longer only to discover he is next in line for management because of his experience.  His wife is thrilled that he's not traveling the world anymore eating out.  And who better to run the store than someone who has been at the lowest level?  Is the teen a slave at $4/hr?  No, because he can walk next door to Kroger and see what they pay.  Maybe it's $4.10.  He decides to stay at Publix because he's already decorated his locker and made friends with the older guy who has great stories about traveling the world.<p>Businesses will determine quite well what their labor is worth and doesn't need USG to do it.

It's not better if we can prevent it altogether by teaching the immune system to fight it off? Chicken Pox is not necessarily harmless; do a Google search for ""shingles"".",1264788075

She has appeared in print and on TV proclaiming that it was a diet, B12 shots, etc that were responsible for ""curing"" her son's autism.  With a little research it turns out that they also used ABA.<p>ABA was the only treatment recommended by the team that diagnosed our son (psychologist, psychiatrist, speech pathologist, OT).<p>There wasn't anything else in the literature that was compelling treatment for Autism (that I know of). I remain open to other treatments if they are safe and effective and doctor recommended.<p>However, a low gluten diet would be difficult for our son.  He had so many sensory issues and eating was a major problem.  I can't imagine trying to work in a low gluten diet at the same time.",1264788031

Levinson, on p51, brought the keys with him (as you mentioned, on p30), but  Levinson, on p52 points out ... well, I&#x27;m not sure.

(I wonder then how Verizon can charge for it.)<p>Levinson, btw, wants to provide the data in a lump data dump, after 60 days of recording (p90). More frequent updates will cost another $1,500.<p>The government, on the other hand, demands real-time data, and wants to install a real-time device which captures <i>all</i> metadata, which is then filtered so that agents only receive what&#x27;s in the pen order (p121). This requires the full SSL keys.<p>The judge agrees with the government that this is reasonable. (line 18, p121).<p>Previously (p56), Levinson asked the court if it was possible to do an audit of the pen register.

They have a lot of catching up to do and it's a seriously great start to something different and unique.  I suspect it will move in the direction of how people use it and want it to work.<p>When Apple brought OS X out to the world for the first time, it was extremely slow, basically unusable, hideous to look at, and Microsoft fans laughed at the effort.  In fact, the industry jumped on Windows XP and IE 6.  However, Apple rev'd, and rev'd and rev'd and polished and brought things to OS X that were innovative and eventually surpassed Windows as an OS people actually wanted to live in all day long. All the while Microsoft seemingly sat around and watched it happen.<p>So for the Surface, at this point, it comes down to execution. Can the Windows team rev and rev and rev? Can marketing push it in a way that gets people buying it? Can evangelism bring enough top-tier designers and developers on board to write grade-A apps for it?  If they can do that, then this sloppy launch will be simply labeled a turning point for Microsoft.  Otherwise, it will be another failed product that just deserved a tiny pat on the back.",1352235471

There have been widespread reports of Romney votes being altered -- days ago.<p>I think our biggest problem is voter registration flaws and the lack of being able to identify that the person listed on the form is the actual one voting. We should also be dipping people's thumbs in ink like they do in Africa and Mexico to ensure that people don't vote twice.<p>Voter fraud is far more common than alleged insidious voting machine malfunctions. Those machines are checked by reps of both parties and under heavy, continual scrutiny. Voter rolls, on the other hand, or absentee ballots are rife with fraud. For example, thousands of military members won't get to vote this election because the department of defense failed to mail the ballots on time.<p>In 2010, I lived in China and didn't get my absentee ballot until 1 month after the election, even though I requested it 6 months prior from the US Consulate in Shanghai. I was disenfranchised like millions of other legal voters, both civilian and military.<p>Some people are more concerned about some old minority lady allegedly with the inability to get a free photo id, yet ignore the military and overseas vote. Yet for the old minority lady, she need only go to the local courthouse to get things straightened out, while a solider in Kabul doesn't have that luxury.<p>Another problem is blantant violations of election law by generally Democrat election judges.

This assumes that most humans fall into broad liberal (counts on government, believes in helping the poor, open to new ideas) or conservative (dislikes taxes, believes in personal responsibility, likes free markets and the past) modes of thinking.<p>Sooner or later, the smaller groups on one side are going to realize that they can push elements of their agenda further if they all vote together. They might not get all of the things that they wanted, but they'll gain more leverage over the people who have a drastically different world view. Once this has happened, all of the people of the other mode of thinking will realize that they now have to band together in order to compete. And wallah, parties are formed.<p>The problem this presents to american voters is that a vote for a third party is effectively a vote for the other side of the ideological divide. Every vote cast for Garry Johnson is directly aiding the cause of Barack Obama. I bet Al Gore hates Ralph Nader to this day. The idea of ""what will happen if the other side wins?"" is a very real motivating factor in the voting booth.<p>I'm not defending the two party system. I'm saying that like free markets, it's an emergent property of human behavior.

Apache licensed code can be used in commercial products. GPL licensed (as with LO) cannot be used without becoming Open Source itself. This is important, because OpenOffice is the one you would take when you are working on a product which needs to include for example spreadsheet features.<p>I work for a company that sells GPLed software to large enterprises and makes quite a bit of money doing so.

GNU licenses _its own marketing materials_, including its website and the text of the software licenses it promotes, under a no-derivatives license.

If I were to work on LibreOffice, it would be because I wanted the world to have a good office suite, not because it is my own enjoyment to develop an office suite for myself.

If the attacker does not share the same cache as the victim, this attack will not work.<p>b) If there are more that just the attacker and the victim on the same machine (core), it is very likely to add a <i>lot</i> of noise to the side channel (attack) signal since it will be busy ""dirtying"" the cache that the side channel attack is being carried out on.  Very likely this will prevent the attack from being successful.",1352232175

4750385,comment,4749603,4749603,1,0,no_more_death,,,"The problem is the idea that a single elected official can somehow represent the entire United States. Can one person understand and represent 300 million people?<p>Impossible.<p>At least, impossible on a deep level. Such understanding is possible only in a very general level, for issues that are very broad.<p>Therefore, government should be as small, localized, and focused as possible. As much power as possible should be invested at the local level.<p>A lot of Europeans don't get this. European countries are already small and homogeneous (apologies for a huge generalization). They already have a fairly local government. The USA needs to work differently because it's the third most populous country in the world and because it's so enormously diverse. Government should be as close to the people as possible. Then if you don't like your municipality or state, you can move a few miles away to get a different municipal / state government.<p>I'm much more concerned about electing people whom I've met personally and had the chance to interact with at a town hall. Grass roots movements are much more effective at understanding people in a deep way. From a conservative perspective (my perspective), the Tea Party is a movement that has had great success enforcing accountability and toppling incumbents. There are similar movements in other political camps as well.<p>Here's the point: localized government increases freedom and choice. It puts local government in a position where it has to compete with other governments (municipal or state). That kind of competition can potentially squeeze out corruption and increase accountability.",1352232152

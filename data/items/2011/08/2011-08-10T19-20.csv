It's okay to have an ""if"" statement or a ""for"" loop in your markup (in fact, it's necessary for dynamically outputting content), just make sure those things are specific to the display of the data, and not the creation or retrieval or ""processing"" of the data. For example, gat all of your data from the database first, put it all into a simple array or simple variables, then just loop through arrays and echo variables in the markup. MVC frameworks will have you put the data retrieval and prep steps in another file altogether, but even if you don't do this, at least shove all of that stuff up at the top of the php file and then at the bottom do all of the markup/display stuff.<p>UPDATE: Here's a stackoverflow link with a zillion more examples and resources about this: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/62617"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/62617</a>",1313006352

My point is about when in the process you make candidates hopping through the hoops and the height and the number of the hoops. I don't have enough time to jump through all the hoops of all the employers that early in the process. It is like in marketing process - awareness, consideration, preference, action, loyalty - insisting and expecting action (buy) immediately at or instead of awareness.<p>Anyway, the process of filling a job vacancy is about mutual fit.

The shared nothing architecture (it really helps you scale).<p>2. The rapid development cycle.<p>3. The portability (Apache, IIS, nginx, persistent in-memory interpreters via PHP-FPM...).<p>4.

The reasons that I see it taking away from the experience they want are:<p>1. It would require users to think about how much room they have on the device. Yes, you theoretically  have to do this anyway, but with approx. half of users never, ever connecting to iTunes, that is something they would have to begin worrying about. Apple doesn't want people to have to think.<p>2. It wouldn't be fast, especially for big files. Soon, people would be complaining that their multi gigabyte movie rip is taking too long over the air. I've done this with a jailbroken phone over wifi-it's a pain. People would try it over 3G, or worse, EDGE.<p>And two non user experience reasons:<p>3. It's scope creep. A phone or tablet isn't meant to replace a computer, despite what everyone says. There isn't a solib business case for them to spend the time to develop this or add in additional storage for all the garbage people would acquire.<p>4.

The latest research on the 'flood' that gave rise to flood myths in every civilization in Southern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, suggests that the Mediterranean Sea was a fertile populated valley during the last ice age. But when the ice age ended due to natural climate change, the rising Atlantic broke through the natural dam at Gibraltar and flooded the valley, and into the Black and Red seas, up the Nile, etc. That's a massive natural disaster that must have wiped out a pretty big chunk of humanity.

To me, Ruby's object-oriented string functions are a lot easier to keep track of than PHP's:<p>x.length vs strlen($x)<p>x.gsub('foo', 'bar') vs str_replace('foo', 'bar', $x)<p>x.strip vs trim($x)<p>x.upcase vs strtoupper($x)<p>All four of the PHP functions use a different form: strX, str_X, X, and strtoX. Some of this could be solved with consistent function names, like always using str_X, but then that makes me wonder why one wouldn't just want to have all string functions available as object-oriented methods on strings. Python takes a different tactic, and has a non-object-oriented len() method, but this isn't just used to get the length of a string, it will also get you the length of a list, tuple, or dictionary.",1313005190

The two questions I would want any company I work for to ask are, ""Why would our developers want to be productive for us?"" and then, ""What do they need to be most productive?"" in that order. Give me a reason to be productive and then make sure my equipment doesn't hold me back.<p>The problem is a lot of people skip the first question and jump straight to the second. I personally believe they do that because the second question is quantifiable. The article is called ""The Price of (Dev) Happiness: Part One"" and it gives a price at the bottom. There is something a manager can put in Excel and show to superiors.<p>However, the ""why"" is more nebulous and harder to enact. Change company culture?

But why do I have to go to the FAQ page to understand what Agony is? Do you really believe mainstream users would go and read FAQs before buying products? The benefit of sorting by ""Agony"" must be explicit on the results page itself. How to make it explicit is something the UI designers at Hipmunk need to think about.<p>2. From $639: When I'm walking by a store and my wife points me to a sign that says ""dresses from 99$"", the sceptic in me reminds her that there are probably just a few dresses that are priced $99(maybe just 1?). The rest are probably priced at 199 or 299 or even 2599. We sometimes still end up going in and buying something, but are very aware that the ""From"" is deceiving.<p>Or when we see a sign that says ""Discount upto 60%"" where the fontsize of the ""Discount upto"" part is 20 and the ""60%"" part is 1000. We know there could be just one item that has a 60% discount. We are skeptical.<p>When a user sees ""From 200$"" on Hipmunk, the same flag is raised. I'd say, just remove the ""From"". As long as they get at least one flight at that price, they're not going to complain. Why confuse users with an extra confusing word?<p>3. Picking flight legs separately: I'm not sure what the basis is of labeling this an edge case. I search for flights, Hipmunk presents me with onward options. At this stage, I have zero visibility into what return options I have for each flight shown. How would you find out the return options? By selecting each individual flight in turn and going to the choose return flight page. That sounds like a lot of potential back and forths (read clicks!) to me. We all know what increasing the number of clicks does to conversion numbers on ecommerce websites.<p>I'm not saying being able to pick legs has no benefit. I'm arguing that this is not the most common use case users care about. A business traveler who has enough time and doesn't have to worry about prices would probably love this feature. But that doesn't sound like the mainstream user to me. And if I were Hipmunk, my target would be mainstream users who aren't the most patient. Think bounce rates? :)<p>4. We might be talking of different things here. my fourth point was about flight durations, I'd like to know how long a flight is. Hipmunk just shows a strip between vertical time markers are spaced 4 hours apart. To find out the duration: (a) I have to hover over the flight (2) I need to do a quick calculation in my head of how long a flight is that departs at 6 am PST and lands at 4.35 PM PST. Not easy.<p>Flight durations are important: they indicate how long I'm stuck on a flight.<p>6. How common is the use case of a person searching for more than 1 flight at the same time? Say, you were looking for a weekend flight from SFO to Boston. What added benefit would you get from opening two tabs?<p>I'm open to the notion that folks might want to run parallel searches. I just don't understand the logic or benefit of doing it. Please educate me :)<p>I think Hipmunk is quite promising. I wrote this when it came out:

Do you think Fog Creek is going to say no? Heck no. They're going to do whatever it takes to keep your developers (and all employees) happy. We are at work a huge percentage of our lives. Not being happy at work is depressing, particularly when the employing company can take steps like this to make the environment welcoming and positive.<p>I think that from an employer perspective, sometimes it's the ""little"" things that pile up and really make a difference. For example, how much does having bagels, cream cheese, coffee, and fresh fruit available every morning really cost a company? In the grand scheme of things, probably not very much. But for those people who need something to kickstart their day, offering this sort of freebie is going to make them happy.<p>In my opinion, the desk setup as described above would make me FAR happier than free breakfast.

2869774,comment,2869426,2869689,14,0,headius,,,"I assume you're referring to the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). DLR does nothing even close to invokedynamic for optimization.<p>The best you can do with DLR is regenerate little dispatch stubs at each dynamic call site, to at least avoid the overhead of re-searching the class hierarchy. These stubs are then reinserted at the dispatch point and used to make the call.<p>Unfortunately, since all current CLR implementations do <i>not</i> optimize code at runtime, these newly-created stubs can't be optimized with the rest of the code. So you get a call from the code to the stub, a few guards, and another dispatch from the stub to the target. Those three pieces never optimize together.<p>invokedynamic is also very useful for optimizing things other than method dispatch. In JRuby master, we're using invokedynamic for constant lookup (as illustrated in this post) and for lazily creating literal values. In both cases, it reduces the access to a single memory hit, much faster than what JRuby 1.6 or any DLR languages can do.<p>tl;dr: DLR is the best you can do for dynamic dispatch optimization at an API level atop current CLR impls and subject to limitations therein. invokedynamic brings true end-to-end dynamic dispatch support to the JVM.",1313004212

So large that the notion of ""The real question is what should humans do about it?"" is still preposterous. We can't ""do something"" about something when we don't understand how that something works. It won't stop us of course, barber's tried to 'balance your humors' to correct illness in Medival times, not because it was effective but it met the goal of 'doing something.' Few people have the tolerance to wait until actually understand how Earth's climate is created/changed/affected before they start acting. And like Medival barbers their actions may make things worse just as easily as they may make things better.<p>I suspect, that you are a 'Climate Fatalist' like I am. I accept that the climate will change and that no matter how much I wish it different, if Yellowstone erupts we're talking ice age baby right then and there. I also accept that it can change quickly without my help so I pursue ways to survive large variations in climates. I've recently been looking at Aquaponics [1] which is a mostly closed loop system for sustainably growing vegetables and protein using a simple eco-system that can be protected from gross changes in the environment. Since it will be impossible (remember I'm a fatalist :-) to get mainstream investment in climate change preparation until rapid climate shifts are upon us, I'm trying to find ways to seed survivability niches.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aquaponics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aquaponics.com/</a>",1313003835

I think the best approach probably varies by individual, and that - to the extent that there might be an objective truth to this point - the truth probably lies in the middle somewhere.  At the very least, I think making a dichotomy between ""no planning ahead at all"" and ""figure everything out in advance"" is a false dichotomy.  It's a continuum, in my experience.<p>I personally lean more towards the exploratory programming style, and the ""figure it out as I go,"" but at the same time, two of my favorite programming tools are an artists sketchpad and a set of colored pencils.  There's definitely a time and place to sit down and sketch out high level relationships and visualize things to help yourself understand how things will fit together.  Well, there is for me.<p>Again, I think this depends a lot on the individual... and also on the problem domain and the inherent complexity of the program.

Our organization's product is a large application written in object-oriented PHP with unit tests for every method of every class. As a team, we use continuous integration and have regular code reviews to promote quality.  We've done some things that we're not proud of, but on the whole our codebase is pretty clean and elegant, and at the end of the day I'm almost always proud of the work I've done.<p>What worries me about PHP is that innovative ideas don't appear to be coming from the PHP community.  They come from Python, or Ruby, or Erlang, or Java projects and are copied by PHP developers afterwards.  I worry there's a risk that PHP is being left behind as the developers who solve new and challenging problems turn to other languages.<p>Furthermore -- and this is just my sense of how things are where I live -- while it's possible (and not even difficult) to write quality PHP code, it seems to be difficult to find developers who care about quality. My manager complains about this constantly and I'm inclined to believe him since, when I was a freelance developer, I saw tons of PHP code that was simply and unambiguously terrible.  Conversely, a developer who wants to write quality code in PHP has to look pretty hard to find a PHP shop that recognizes quality and values it. I suppose that these issues aren't tied to a particular language, but they seem more pronounced with PHP.",1313003340

Even though it might become necessary in response to natural variations, those tend to happen across fairly large timescales. Accelerating such changes by artificial means, as seems to be happening right now, is a bad thing not because it's artificial but because it likely increases the cost and difficulty of future mitigation, much like hitting the gas pedal on a steep downward slope would. In other words, I think it's going to be more expensive later than now - not to the point of shutting down all industry or anything like that, but to the extent of budgeting 1-2% for efficiency/mitigation.",1313003327

The fact that strings can be evaluated as numbers is great for accepting input from GET or POST because it means that there is no need to worry about explicitly casting strings to numbers.<p>Of course, input type validation is still important, and if a variable input by the user is supposed to be numeric, that is why there is the is_numeric() function to validate the type of a variable.<p>But once I've used is_numeric() and know that the string is numeric why should I bother with an explicit strtoint call? I feel that this feature of PHP if used correctly takes away complexity and repetition related to converting strings to integers.<p>In a realistic project the framework for your app should have a layer between user input and your code anyway. At this layer it will be validating that input from the user is of the correct type anyway, and once that variable passes the is_numeric() test the layer can easily cast that input string to an int so that it is the right type for JSON encoded objects or any other output from PHP for other languages that needs to have specific types.<p>Once again, if PHP is used properly, with a decent code architecture this feature of PHP is not a problem.",1313002909

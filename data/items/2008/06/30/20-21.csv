An on-screen keyboard isn't easier or faster to type on, but it allows for a larger screen and probably cheaper manufacturing costs.<p>You have to mention the trade-offs if you want useful information from your question. More like: <i>Would you rather have a powerful engine that gets mediocre gas milage, or a mediocre engine that gets great gas milage?</i><p>Otherwise you'll just get everyone saying they want the powerful engine.",1214859567

Would that it were so easy with MS SQL Server 2000. I asked an MS-savvy colleague how to take a backup of the finance database in the company I was working at, so I could test some new tools on the backup copy.<p>He talked me through the whole thing, I just pressed the buttons. Then he got to the fateful words: ""now you just press F6 and away we go."" In the blizzard of words which whirled across the screen, I could just make out the line ""Dropped database 'Finance'"" I asked my colleague about this, and we both got that nasty, ice-cold ass-puckering feeling you get when you just f*cked up really badly. We went and bought cakes for the Finance Dept while the DB was restored from backup tape, although half a day's work was lost.<p>Technically not my fault, but I did press the button and I hate dropping other people in it, so I fell on my sword, so to speak, and took the blame.",1214858353

232409,comment,232202,232381,0,0,gruseom,,,"Actually, I think you're putting your finger on a certain tension here (I won't say contradiction) in the agile principles. On the one hand, develop incrementally and adapt to change; on the other hand, build the simplest thing that meets the requirements now (and resist the temptation to avoid generalizing up front). The trouble is that code that does X in a direct, concrete way can't always be easily changed to meet the new requirements when X changes to X'.<p>The typical agile answer is, ""We'll just refactor to allow the necessary changes as we go along."" This is an oversimplification, because the cost of such refactoring isn't always low. Sometimes it's no less than the cost of rewriting the system. Other times the refactoring leads to suboptimal solutions for X', compared with what you would have if you designed for X' originally. I've seen agile projects get into trouble this way.<p>There's no question that up-front generality is often misplaced (since you can't know for sure what you'll need in the future) and can cause a lot of complexity damage. But the answer doesn't lie in making a ""process"" out of a half-dozen or dozen principles and pretending you've solved the problem.",1214857610

It's part of being a good programmer to make good judgments about these things.<p>What people usually do (and this author, in my opinion, is doing) is observe one unhelpful behavior and conclude that the opposite behavior must be ""correct"". I think this is because building software is a complex activity, so we seek invariant principles to simplify it.

It worked really well. It gave the other side of the story and provided a LOT of engagement with the user. I believe yelp has adopted something similar now.<p>We tried it with a private system (rebuttals not viewable by the public) and a public system. The private system showed FAR less engagement in terms of the business and the user working out their differences. When it was all done out in the open the users seemed much more willing to engage with the business owner. In our test greater than 70% of the conflicts were resolved. In private the number was much lower (I don't remember the exact number, but it was less than 40%).<p>I'd love to see that on the respective markets.",1284922799

Forcing auto-renewal upon customers (and providing no way to turn it off short of actually cancelling the account) is, alas, common, but most companies won't go so far as to turn the auto-renewal over to collections. They'll send you an email or two complaining, then cancel the account. I think all the times it's happened to me it's actually been stated like that in the emails pretty explicitly; something like, your credit card is no longer valid, please log in and provide new details within X days or your account will be canceled.<p>Does this kind of thing meaningfully damage your credit, though?

He even lists the scores he has gotten that didn't go in.  This is all despite the fact that all of his scores are lower than the lowest high score in the list!  I think we have even posted reviews to try to explain this to the user and to get him to e-mail us at the support address but he hasn't done that or stopped posting his review.<p>I think iOS (and Android) needs to make it easier to interact with customers and address their issues in the market.  There could simply be another section besides comments called ""feedback"" or ""support"".  In this section, your posts are only visible to the devs (and I guess Apple) and you can maintain an ongoing thread of replies to a post.  This would allow users to give feedback and receive support without filling the reviews with bullshit, and without having to e-mail the support address (and thus give out their e-mail).",1284922286

He reinforces with a claim that people go to college because others do, rather than because they've simultaneously converged on the idea that it's a good investment. He doesn't provide any evidence that higher education is actually viewed as a status symbol.<p>More significantly, though, the author doesn't propose or imply any solution for the system as a whole, or even one of his pain points.

If we let the CSRs do it, they'd pick the way that was easiest for them, but would ignore things that were less visible or useful to them.  So their direct manager does the deciding.  Whenever she outlines how changes to the system work, she always talks about how it'll improve their efficiency and how it'll improve the efficiency of the company as a whole.  When work comes from the next rung up the corporate ladder, it's almost always about management's side of things instead.<p>So you have to balance it all out, and have someone that can see all the angles.

Gameplay and graphics had a nice simplicity that holds up today, unlike most pre-NES games. It was a period when games were just starting to become what they are now, with plots, actual level design, and ""thinking"" enemies, but without all the complexity. Sure, most NES games won't hold your attention for hours at a time, but they're still enjoyable in brief sittings.<p>What I find impossible to play today are early 3D games. So much time and effort was spent trying to make the games look cool and flashy at the cost of gameplay, and it was when most devs really didn't even know how to make a 3D game. Most first-year PS1 and N64 games are examples of this.",1284919233

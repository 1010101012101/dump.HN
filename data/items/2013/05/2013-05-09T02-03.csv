To play Devil's advocate for a moment, the bankers that manipulated LIBOR did so for quite some time without being caught. Those whom submitted the rates they thought their bank could borrow from other banks at wielded incredible power, magnitudes more than any VC, i.e. contracts worth $300 TRILLION were influenced by LIBOR. It was shown that these bankers acted, most would agree completely immorally, without conscience, artificially influencing the rates to suit their own trader's positions.",1368068329

Yes, I'm paying it every year and may never use it but the nature of insurance is that I'm Doing It Right if I never have to use it.<p>I also struggle to align myself with the attitude that 1.5-2.5% of my wage is worth more than the safety net that I and my fellow countrymen can rely on to be mostly protected from most life-threatening health issues if and when they need it. To me, the well-being of all of the people in my society (no matter how poor or rich) is worth 1.5-2.5% of my wage.<p>It's certainly fascinating looking in from the outside as the US wrestles with topics such as universal healthcare, gun laws, etc. It strikes me as stemming from core philosophic viewpoints that seem to be ingrained in the US psyche but absent from many other western nations.<p>In the end, I'm very grateful that I live somewhere with socialised universal healthcare.",1368067985

5678499,comment,5677220,5677220,2,0,jusben1369,,,"One of the problems when we discuss ""healthcare"" is the wide variety of price points for healthcare. So at one end of the market you have fully insured people asking for and/or being prescribed an array of drugs. Often quite literally they take a new drug to offset the harsher side effects of another drug so that it builds to the point whereby they'll start their day with 6 - 10 different pills. At this end of the market you could apply market forces and have significant results. If people more fully feel the burden of cost with those drugs they might very well tackle the underlying causes around obesity, diabetes etc. ""If you could drop 30 or 40 pounds you'd probably find you're spending $200 less per month on medication"" Sign me up!<p>However, at the middle of the market and the most serious end of the market you're looking at procedures and ailments that can cost $10,000 to $250,000. Here, if you have free market forces at play you're asking people (including many parents) to make horrible decisions between what they can afford and what is best for the quality of life for years or decades. Some will be comfortable with that I know but it appears, given the acceptance and re-election of Obama, that the majority of people in America are more open to the government running healthcare. (I wrote a blog post where I said that the fear of being financially and emotionally destroyed by healthcare was now on par with foreign invasion. As such, just as no one wants free market forces in terms of national defense they now don't want free market forces in healthcare - shameless plug and done! <a href=""http://jmlite.tumblr.com/post/46257541683/why-healthcare-in-the-us-should-be-thought-of-as"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmlite.tumblr.com/post/46257541683/why-healthcare-in-...</a><p>I think free market forces can be applied at certain price points but I can't see how it can be the driving principle across the entire spectrum. I think state run pricing and procedures that cover 80% + of the population with a legitimate private option for those with the drive or means to pay is the best possible outcome from a tough position.",1368067973

They really meant they'll bill my insurance.<p>My insurance company didn't have a negotiated rate with the hospital and the treatment was considered out of network.  Instead of paying only the maximum out of pocket cost of $4,000 USD per year, insurance only offered 50% and I got hit with a bill for $50,000.

5678400,comment,5673628,5674364,1,0,NamTaf,,,"This.<p>If I were dealing with that level of photography here's how I would consider setting it up:<p>I'd buy a home NAS and shove it full of disks (a Proliant Microserver can take 4x3TB drives easily, 6 if you want to get creative with ports and USB bootable sticks) and run it as a RAID-5 array. This cost me about $600-$700 a couple of years ago, drives inclusive. My array sits on a bookshelf, tucked away, almost silent (drives are the majority of the noise sometimes) and low-power. RAID gives it pretty decent durability so if you do get a hard drive freakout you're able to correct pretty easy. When one of my hard drives went dicky, I just ddrescue'd it across to a fresh drive then let the RAID array rebuild the bad data (RAID-Z is so sexy but that's another topic). You could probably just DD the thing and rely on the RAID checksums to do it or even just checksum the entire lot, depending on the volume of data.<p>Then I'd link Crashplan or Glacier to those folders and have it periodically diff/sync the data (e.g: overnight once a week/month). I don't have any such setup myself but I have read posts on forums from guys who have set this up as automated syncing of folders and they seem pretty happy with it. This is essentially an insurance against fat-fingeredness or your house burning down.<p>Now you have an offsite backup that is always relatively recent and an onsite backup that is free to access to your heart's content for modification through almost any medium. Yearly crashplan unlimited access costs $70 for a single device which is really all you're after, because your working storage is your NAS and the NAS is all that'll ever be touching the crashplan storage. I don't know Glacier pricing but I'd imagine that for some workflows it could be beneficial and for others it could be detrimental.<p>Dropbox can be set to sync with a subfolder so that if you take images on your iDevice or equivalent it automatically syncs them via dropbox to your NAS. Dropbox can also act as your working directory for any images you may be tinkering with on a remote device that can't just access the NAS outright. Rsync can be used to transfer files out of the dropbox folder to the main folder or to a 'to be sorted/postprocessed' folder on a periodic basis - essentially, every day you take a bunch of photos, that night it checks dropbox for those photos and shifts them out to free up more space. The NAS is a full linux install so it's flexible on what you can do.<p>The only downside I can see here is that you don't have every single image in the cloud, available to every single device at any given moment. I'm not sure if for your gigabytes of photographic memories that that's necessarily an issue, nor am I sure that if you're primarily editing stuff on a fullsized computer with e.g. Lightroom that is usually on the same network as the NAS, that it's a problem either. Sharing of data can be facilitated through a public dropbox folder that you just copy stuff in to when you want to share those images.<p>Anyway, from the perspective of someone who doesn't actually do this. I'm sure there's tools I don't know about that could slot in to this workflow and solve other problems that may affect some people. The beauty of it is given that the storage is yours, local to you and based on a full linux distro, you're free to do just about anything to it. Change backup providers? No problem, just resync all data. Workflow changes and you need a new feature? Find it and install it.<p>I look forward to hearing feedback on why this may/may not work for you :)",1368066014

I paid those taxes two years ago, not last year. Last year's US tax bill (when I cleared $100K) was $0. It was two years ago when I had to pay $2000. Those records are more difficult to get access to than I care to do, and I don't recall the reason.<p>> You do not have to pay payroll taxes if you are employed abroad<p>Correct. But as I started off, I'm self-employed.<p>Quoting from elsewhere: ""If you are self-employed and you live overseas, you may still be required to pay self-employment taxes in the US, including Social Security. This would need to be paid before the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion so it is an actual out-of-pocket expense, not something that would be offset on your expat tax return.""<p>The exceptions are those countries which have a totalization agreement with the US. ""This covers Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea (South), Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.""<p>> It really isn't that big of a deal<p>If you focus just on that number then I agree. As that's what this linked-to page discusses, then yes you're right.<p>I think there's a more interesting numbers lurking. From the article, ""I.R.S. data for 2012 shows just over two million tax returns filed in 2012 by overseas Americans, compared with an estimated six million Americans living or working abroad.""<p>Now, a tax return can cover multiple people and some of the Americans living abroad are children. I'll be generous and say that some one million people aren't following the law, compared to a few hundred people who are doing what the law says in order to avoid the extra hassle.<p>Has that reporting rate gone up or down? How much revenue has the US gotten from its ex-pats because of the heightened reporting requirements? How much has it cost those Americans? I pay about $600/year for my CPA, for me and my wife, so assuming $100/return gives an unfunded mandate, as it were, of $200 million.<p>Before I moved here, I visited often for work. I would rent a business apartment for a month or two. Most work on P.O.s and the giro/SWIFT system, not by credit card or cash. I also had difficulty purchasing some things online because sites wanted a Nordic bank card. I figured that opening a local account would make things easier for me. Had I been any nationality other than US, I could have done so. But US banking laws prohibited me from doing so.<p>Again, not a big deal.

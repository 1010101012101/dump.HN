2427492,comment,2420509,2420648,10,0,NateLawson,,,"As another HN reader who does security for a living, perhaps I can add some specific points. (I know this thread is probably dead given that it is 1 day old, but I access this site via HN Daily now so bear with me.)<p>* No transport security. As many people mention, at least adding HTTPS would help with this. However, most non-browser SSL clients (wget, curl) don't include any root certs by default so even switching to SSL would not help this method. Firesheep, sslstrip, etc. automatically generate a self-signed cert which would look no different to wget than a real cert.<p>* No persistence. If you download any installer package once and then reuse it on multiple machines, you get the benefit of knowing that the same code was installed on each machine (good or bad). With this method, users may catch the site in the middle of an update and get multiple versions of the package.<p>* No authentication. Even with SSL, you only get strong transport security. You would know strongly that "".pow.cx"" sent you some code, but not how that code got put on the server. With package-signing, typically done on the developer's end system, you know that it was protected even before it was uploaded to some site.<p>* Easier to trojan than binaries. Inserting a few extra shell commands in a single HTTP(S) session (say, targeting a single client IP) is much easier than building a custom binary package. Consider how hard it is to even compile Firefox with all the dependencies. Now do that work and insert a trojan and upload a separate 10 MB binary that needs to be stored somewhere on the server while waiting for that one client to visit the site. Compare this to keeping a two-line patch to a shell script (easily done in RAM, maybe even by hotpatch).<p>* Trains users that all the above is ok since the popularity of this ""| sh"" install method is relatively new. (Yes, I know about shar scripts in the past but those ended by 1996 or so with the advent of real package managers). It is absolutely impossible to retrofit ""| sh"" to be secure, whereas it is definitely feasible to add package signature verification support to gem or yum or apt or whatever (in fact, all those already support it).<p>The fact that many installers aren't signed today is not an ok to drive this process back to the 80's. We should be moving toward the future when package signing is a required part of being a software developer. Too hard? Well build tools to make this easier!",1302368225
2427491,comment,2427296,2427472,9,0,tptacek,,,"Funny? No, just boring. ""DHS"" siezes domain names because DHS was hurriedly created, as a reaction to 9/11, by jamming agencies together like so many insects in the transporter from The Fly. One of those agencies happened to be Immigration and Customs, which has always had IPR enforcement in its portfolio.<p>Every time people make these conspiracy-theoretic comments about how ""Homeland Security"" is doing antipiracy raids, they betray either a lack of understanding of how their government is actually structured, or an easygoing willingness to buy into Internet drama, or both.

2427488,comment,2427296,2427296,80,0,grellas,,,"The FCC's claim of authority in this instance to impose rules from on high <i>is</i> problematic.<p>Here is what EFF says:<p>""We’re wholly in favor of net neutrality in practice, but a finding of ancillary jurisdiction here would give the FCC pretty much boundless authority to regulate the Internet for whatever it sees fit. And that kind of unrestrained authority makes us nervous about follow-on initiatives like broadcast flags and indecency campaigns. In general, we think arguments that regulating the Internet is 'ancillary' to some other regulatory authority that the FCC has been granted just don’t have sufficient limitations to stop bad FCC behavior in the future and create the 'Trojan horse' risk we have long warned about."" (<a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/02/part-i-fcc-ancillary-authority-regulate-internet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/02/part-i-fcc-ancillary-a...</a>)<p>I have chimed in on this in a previous HN thread:<p>""The FCC is way out of its league on this one. Basically, it is a creature of statute. It can do whatever Congress has authorized it to and no more. Nothing in its authorizing statute expressly permits it to impose the rules now known as net neutrality. Therefore, it sought to justify its ability to do so under the doctrine of so-called 'ancillary jurisdiction,' meaning that it had an implied power to do so in aid of its expressly granted powers. Unfortunately, a definitive federal appeals court ruling held that no such ancillary jurisdiction existed, leaving the matter for Congress to decide. Rather than deferring to Congress, the FCC chose to adopt a new rationale for its assertion of this authority. Congress overwhelmingly balked at the idea of any broad assertion of such authority and, in the back and forth, the FCC came up with the toe-in-the water approach just adopted to the satisfaction of almost no one. Even this assertion of jurisdiction will certainly be challenged in the courts in cases that will take years to decide, leaving this whole issue in a pathetic state of uncertainty for all concerned. Nothing good will come of this except for lots of employment for the lawyers who will be litigating whether this or that action is 'reasonable' and whether the internet is really like a public utility or not. All in all, a royal mess.""

Then the groats are parcooked by steaming, rolled flat and sometimes baked. These are your ""Old Fashioned Quaker Oats."" ""Quick-Cooking"" varieties are made in a similar way, only the chaff AND the bran have been removed. The bran is the nutritious part.<p>Around the turn of the century, the US imported most of its oats from Scotland and Canada. These would have been ""steel cut oats"" with the bran left on them. Rolled oats would have been relatively new in 1914. I have no idea when quick-cooking oats appeared.<p>So the difference is in what you buy. Think 'pig' versus 'pork' -- to a food scientist, there's a word for the grain in every stage of it's processing. But to us, it's just an oat. It's convenient language for Quaker to put ""100% Whole Rolled Oats"" on the package, because that's what they are. Are they whole rolled groats with the bran still on them? Or are they whole rolled endosperms, which are mostly the high-calorie starch that the germ uses to become a plant?<p>BTW, if you love oatmeal as much as I do, you will appreciate slow-cooked oats:<p><a href=""http://www.foodnetwork.com/good-eats/oat-cuisine/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foodnetwork.com/good-eats/oat-cuisine/index.html</a>",1302367607

However, yesterday when I opened a box of flour that I'd ordered from the internet, I realised that it made me feel kinda snobby. Why do I order flour off the internet? Protein content. Read this:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour#Flour_type_numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour#Flour_type_numbers</a><p>There's a lot more to flour production than the milling. Or the bleaching. We think of flour as just being ""ground wheat"" -- turns out, there's plenty of kinds you never see, which have a greater nutritional value than what your standard preprepared-from-grains prepackaged food item is made from. Think of it as the difference between the coffee you buy in the supermarket in tins and the beans you pick up at Intelligentsia or Peets. Prepackaged foods are optimized for profit to the manufacturer, using the cheapest available ingredients.<p>What are your sources of grains? Specifically, if you taped a USDA Food Pyramid graphic to your refrigerator and kept track of how many servings of each as per those recommendations are you consuming a day? Remember that one sandwich is two servings of grain. (I am NOT endorsing the USDA food pyramid. Just using it as a reference point.) You might even get Mr Taubes to admit that not all grains are equal.<p>As for extending prepackaged foods with fillers, look for ingredients on the label such as carboxymethyl cellulose, carageenan, guar gum, xanthan gum, agar, pectin or maltodextrin. These things are called stabilizers, thickening agents and bulking agents by the food industry. They are cheap, and some of them are not entirely bad for you, as they contain indigestible fibers, but for the most part, they are nutritionally empty. Real, good food that is made the proper way doesn't need to be thickened, bulked up or stabilized.<p>As a would-have-been pastry chef and baker, this is a topic somewhat dear to my heart. It's somewhat suspicious that I lived on bread, yogurt, cheese and pasta in CH for 19 months and still lost 65lbs. My hunch -- and it's only a hunch -- is that there's something in our food here in the US that's partly to blame.<p>Also, my great-grandmother would have used groats, not steamed, rolled quick-cooking oats.

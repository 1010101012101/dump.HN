Looking through their history, it looks like all their comments past a certain date are [dead], and that they're not aware of this fact - but I also don't see anything particularly offensive in their history.  Is it possible they somehow mistakenly get auto-flagged and no one notices?  It doesn't seem possible to upvote or reply to [dead] comments, so how can they climb out of this hole which they're (presumably) not even aware they're in?",1242374386

But I think you take devices you use as granted - computers, mobile phones. Our generation (I'm 1969) was exploring these devices themselves, how they work and how to make them work our way. We learned computer languages from listings in magazines and by trial and error. We thought AI is around the corner, we were sure computers can change our lives, but never foresaw Internet.<p>Edit: oh, and we thought digital electronics is an essential part of software engineering. So different now.",1242374016

From the perspective of the guy who signs up on your SNS twelve weeks from now after reading about it on Bob's SNS Addict Blog, the site had ads from launch day.  But if you actually put ads on it on Launch Day, you might not get that link from Bob in the first place.<p>P.S. On the other hand, if you charge money, charge money from day one.  Even if you're not actually charging anyone because you mailed Bob a free invite code because you dig his blog especially that series on MySpace monetization and thought your new site would interest him.  Free stuff = meh, the Internet is full of it.  I am getting for free <i>what other people are paying money for</i> = proves my status as an expert on this field (validating my self-worth) and makes me like you enough to want to write a review in which I will (strike)brag(/strike) disclose that you thought I was an expert worthy of a freebie.<p>Edited to add: SNS means ""social networking service"".  Apparently its a Japan thing.  Sorry!",1242373736

It's not <i>bad</i>, not <i>wrong</i>, but possibly <i>inefficient</i> enough to be detrimental to the survival of the society as a unit.<p>To put it another way: Thoreau is compelling but he had the luxury of civil peace, plenty of land, good crops, and natural barriers to invasion.

610204,comment,609881,610156,0,0,sho,,,"That may be a factor, but it is not the only factor. When applying for a spouse visa, someone from (say) Norway has little economic incentive to gain the visa. As a general rule of thumb, their visa will be subject to less checks and the marriage assumed to be genuine. They just don't have much motive to lie or try and fake their way through.<p>Someone moving from (say) Cambodia, however, will face an entirely different situation. They plainly have any number of motives to get the hell out of Cambodia and into a big rich country. These motives can and do lead to fake marriages, fake information, everything. The application will be given a far greater level of scrutiny and will take a <i>lot</i> longer.<p>Hell, don't take my word for it, Australian immigration spells it out.

Also if you're rating co-workers from previous companies then old animosities could be perpetuated online.<p>I'm only cautious because in a couple of places that I've worked at in the past the office politics was occasionally quite toxic, and amplification of that via the internet could have quite serious consequences.",1295092410

There's always a push, initiating your actions.<p>A great example of using it for your benefit is described in The Creative Habit by Twyla Tharp, where she says that having daily rituals helps in shaping new habits. In her example every morning she goes outside and hails a taxi; then she goes to the gym where she exercises for an hour. The point is she's not <i>going to the gym</i> every morning (that's hard, I tried it); instead she's just <i>hailing a taxi</i> (sounds much easier, doesn't it?). This puts her in motion. Waking up is a trigger to have a shower and dress, this leads to putting your shoes on and getting outside; once you're outside you just call the taxi, and once you're in the taxi there's no going back. You've tricked yourself into going to the gym. Again!",1295089511

299581,comment,299233,299233,0,0,webwright,,,"I think the biggest risk is ""death by fizzling out"".  Startups are fun... at first.  Eventually, they hit a point where they (hopefully only briefly) aren't remotely fun and are instead hard freakin' work that you'd love to avoid.  So spend some time engineering a ""system"" where you can't slack off (have a co-founder who depends on you and have recurring scheduled work days to avoid the ""Meh, I'm pretty slammed this week-- I'll get back to things next week"" state.<p>The second biggest risk is failure to pull the trigger (or inability to do so).  Know what your target is for jumping into it full-time (and make sure co-founders are on board with this target).  Be sure you have the financial means to jump when the time comes-- start saving now.  PROFIT generally comes a long time after REVENUE.<p>I wrote a guest post on VentureHacks on this exact topic (<a href=""http://venturehacks.com/articles/half-assed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturehacks.com/articles/half-assed</a> ).

Here's what I've been laboring on: <a href=""http://clovercontent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clovercontent.com</a><p>- Use every spare moment you can find to work on your startup.<p>- If you're married, don't neglect your wife/husband. Make  time for what's truly important.<p>- Stay up late, but don't forgo sleep.<p>- Slim down your feature set and only do what's absolutely necessary.<p>- Lock yourself away in a private area so you can get into the zone.<p>- DON'T USE CREDIT. If you can't afford something (hosting, etc.) wait until you can. Start your company without debt.<p>- Get friends and family to test your software. There's no better QA department than your spouse. Who could be more critical than the person you married.<p>- Sometimes you won't be able to work on your project for weeks. Don't sweat it. Wait it out and keep focused. Come back to it.<p>- Stay focused on completing the software, no matter what problems come up. You can complete it. You will mentally fight your own self telling you to quite. That's the hardest part.<p>- The question ""why am I doing this?"" will come up in your internal monolgue at least 5 times a day. You have to really want it to combat your own doubt.",1220979181

The first thing you should do is find out why it's slow. In your case, it sounds as though  you were fetching one url at a time (blocking). Switching to async io all could have fixed this.<p>Btw, if you're using the Gnu utilities, it's unlikely that they were written in the 60's and 70's (also, people were processing much smaller amounts of data back then).",1220979057

Are you willing to basically pay - with both cash and time - for the privilege of educating the programmers you're using until they're up to your standards? Or to throw away their work and look for better programmers, possibly ad infinitum?  Rewrite parts of the code yourself?<p>I haven't outsourced any projects so far.  I have, however, worked on a project launched with an off-the-shelf script - it definitely saved time and effort upfront, but the code is far from great, so it's been more frustrating over time.

4020528,comment,4019660,4020379,6,0,lukifer,,,"> If a monopoly occurs because the majority of consumers are giving that product/service their money, then it must be deserving of it.<p>""Deserving"" is subjective, and that attitude doesn't seem far from ""might makes right"". Beta was better than VHS (or so I hear), but the consumers went where the content was, and the better format lost.<p>> I see no reason for the government to get involved with Apple's private marketplace.<p>Except it already is involved: the government issues currency and defends copyrights and patents, all backed by (heavily abstracted) violence. In fact, remove the threat of prosecuting NDAs alone, and I guarantee that Apple as we know it would collapse within a year.<p>> How is that any different than a Government defining arbitrary rules on the national marketplace?<p>In theory, the rules are not arbitrary, but driven by democratic processes. In practice, such rules might as well be arbitrary, if not openly hostile, and I will stipulate this as unfixable (for now).<p>But we already have marketplace rules all over the place, whether by law or by convention: don't false advertise, don't market poison as candy, etc. I don't see why ""you're not allowed to encrypt everything so you're the only game in town"" can't be one of them. Moreover, I don't see a difference between a tyrannical Apple and a tyrannical government, except in details and scale, and I'm not willing to settle for either.<p>For the record: I am typing this on a MacBook Pro. I think curtailing Apple's monopolistic tendencies would be not only be good for users and the ecosystem, but in the long run, good for Apple itself. For instance: if users are allowed to side-load any old app, they can curate their App Store to their heart's content, including only the best of the best, and regular users would be <i>more</i> satisfied their experience as a result.",1337893171

So Google's philosophy (for better or worse) is often to find and fix the root causes of problems. So for an account that was hijacked, we'd prefer to put our resources into finding new ways to prevent and protect against hijacked accounts, rather than putting a ton of people into one-on-one sessions to work with people whose accounts are hijacked. For one thing, the scale of Gmail makes those sort of one-on-one consultations extremely difficult.<p>Imagine if tens of thousands of accounts are hijacked every day. There's not an easy way to interact with all those people, which is why we look for ways to drive down the number of hijacks or provide additional solutions like two-factor authentication or other self-service solutions.<p>In this case, there was a subtle point that I was trying to make, which is that the problem resolved itself even though the original poster never appeared to give his email address.

You are now old and your liklihood of getting here by building wealth via the markets is probably lower than you think.<p>Alternate reality:<p>- Phase 1 (year 1-2): Save aggressively $200k by living like a bum.<p>- Phase 2: (years 3-8): With your independence, start a series of high growth ventures (some of which will fail) and work incredibly hard to build wealth. By year 5 you should be cash flow positive, by year 8 you should have $1-5m.<p>- Phase 3: (years 9-15): You are completely financially secure with a passive risk free income on interest of $150k-250k/yr on your cash sum. This is time for you to decide if your dreams require more passive income than that. If so, spend this time continuing to work independently and building wealth. If not, you're retired here and can do what you please on your 6-figure risk free salary.<p>- Phase 4 (optional): Get to $10m-20m in the bank.

The usage of the words ""theft"" and ""piracy"" to refer to patent and copyright infringement is a symptom of this state of mind.<p>Thomas Jefferson et al would have called this nonsense. By its very nature, an idea -- once divulged -- cannot be someone's property, and it should not be treated as such. To prevent the free flow of ideas through a populace is, in many cases, harmful. (Imagine a group of hunter gatherers in which one family has patented the idea of farming.) At <i>most</i>, limited monopolies should be granted to prevent situations in which nobody is incentivized to create due to rampant copying. But we still have to be judicious in granting these monopolies:<p><pre><code>    ""...it may be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of invention\n    are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices.""\n    -- Thomas Jefferson\n\n    ""But grants of this sort can be justified in very peculiar cases only, if at\n    all; the danger being very great that the good resulting from the operation\n    of the monopoly, will be overbalanced by the evil effect of the precedent; and\n    it being not impossible that the monopoly itself, in its original operation,\n    may produce more evil than good.""\n    -- James Madison\n</code></pre>\nIt's painful to see copyrights and patents today accomplishing the <i>polar opposite</i> of what they were intended to. But we've been gradually heading in this direction for the last 200 years.<p>In my opinion it's a combination of (a) allowing businesses to have too much say in law-making, (b) Congress + the populace not being sufficiently educated about the implications of copyrights and patents, thus giving more power to the natural tendency to think of ideas as property, and (c) the Supreme Court following overly non-interventionist policies and allowing Congress to make unconstitutional decisions.",1337891103

If the meetup event is not to your liking.  Figure out why you don't like it and leave.  No point in wasting time.<p>9. Write a very small and brief thank you note to the organizer afterwards.

Meditate for 15 minutes and put at least one hour into one of my projects.<p>The amount of time I put into my personal projects depend on if there is any complex problems going on, I am just starting one or it's in maintenance mode.  But I always try to put at least one hour into them.  I was hard to actually find time for all of those things, but I finally managed to find a balance.<p>I must mentioned that as a big soccer/futbol fan the fact that all mayor leagues are in off-season has boosted my productivity.",1337889808

If anything I'd think Google would find it in its (and, frankly, our) best interests to let the patent war escalate further.  The more of a mess it is, the more likely someone in government will step in to intervene.

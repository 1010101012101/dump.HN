22845,comment,22726,22731,0,0,BrandonM,,,"That was the purpose of my second paragraph, but maybe I didn't get the point across enough.  I don't think Rails is bad, not at all.  I think Rails is great for getting projects up and running quickly, and for easily adding to the projects later on.  You simply need to expend some energy on optimization (and reliability) once you find yourself growing to sizes that test your current code base.  This could involve writing some frequently used code in a low-level language, rewriting a Rails function you're using which does more than you really need into straight Ruby, or reconsidering some of your SQL queries and handwriting some of those that are automatically handled.<p>All I'm trying to say is that no matter who you are, at some point in the scaling process, you are going to have to revisit your code and make improvements.  The great thing about Ruby, Python, Lisp, etc is the ability to throw a bunch of code down and get something running quickly.  This code is inherently not optimal, and this is not a bad thing.  Once you start to see problems, however, it's time to profile and re-think some of the things you are doing in order to improve your software overall.",1179421187

22841,comment,22726,22735,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Ahh, you're right.  I should have said, ""you need to expend some energy on optimization and ensuring reliability.""  I guess I was making the assumption that the software was basically working, but failing under heavy load, which seems to be an optimization problem.  I let it be given that the software is correct, but perhaps that is not a safe thing to do.<p>And I totally agree that Rails et al are great development platforms to get up and running quickly, but when that software begins to fail with increasing traffic, it's time to first reconsider your own code (algorithms and bulletproofiness (as Colbert might say)), and if that doesn't help, to consider rewriting at least parts in something else.<p>I can't imagine the call stack for a single Rails function call (I'm actually not all that familiar with Rails).  At the very least, it might be good to migrate some code from Rails to straight Ruby, and some of the auto-generated stuff to hand-tuned SQL.  That's all I was trying to say.",1179420917

22830,comment,22812,22812,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"News.YC really isn't the place for you to make false & libelous attacks against my business practices and my company.  I wish you would've brought your concerns directly to my attention first, and I would've been glad to address them.<p>If you believe the company is operating illegally, then you should've brought my business practices to the attention of the government agency with which the company is registered.  Specifically, you can contact Sarah Weeks. She's the IRS Bank Secrecy Act Revenue Agent in our area.  I work with her extensively, to make sure our company is in compliance with all applicable regulations.<p>Her contact information is:<p>Sarah Weeks, Internal Revenue Service, 400 North Street, Room 948(MD#65), Richmond VA 23219  <p>Office Ph. 804.916.8056<p>
Again, this isn't the place to have this discussion, but you've made public, false accusations.  I'm forced to respond:<p>===================================<p><i>Sam claims they have a very rigorous ""authentication process"". Right. He sits in his dorm counting...</i><p>Actually, if you took some time to research me, you'd realize I don't live in a dorm room.  Here are some pictures of where I work:

As shown on that page, we've invested in several thousand dollars worth of equipment in order to verify the authenticity of the currency we sell. <p><i> how many suckers he can find.</i><p>Please don't call my customers ""suckers.""  If you're suggesting I rip them off - ask them, you can check my company's record at the BBB.  My customers tell me it's stellar.<p><i>Hmm 5 Million dinars are a lot cheaper at <a href=""http://www.gidassociates.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gidassociates.com</a> </i><p>Yes, prices do vary in this market (as in every market).  However many customers are happy doing business with us, and feel we're more reliable.  We've been in business selling dinars longer than just about every one of our competitors (including GIDAssociates, according to the date on their treasury registration).<p>You're right though, we are more expensive.  I'll try to find some ways to cut costs without sacrificing service (which is our differentiating feature). Hopefully, I can bring my prices down so that they're more competitive with GIDAssociates. <p><i>Furthermore, Sam actually ships the Dinar's too you. That's really shady. </i><p>The dinar is such a new currency, it is not traded on the Foreign Currency Exchange market.  This is why you can't get it at traditional currency exchange locations, or trade it electronically.  Our whole business model (just like those of our competitors) is filling this gap - and providing early investors access to this currency when they can't get it elsewhere.<p><i>""Bookmark this page, otherwise you will not be able to return to these prices at a later time.""</i><p>Because the Iraqi dinar exchange rate changes, our prices are forced to change as well.<p>We've had customers complain that they visit the site one day, and when they come back the next - the price is different.  To solve this problem, each time you visit the store on the website, you're given a unique URL and a static price.  If you return to the same URL, you'll be able to purchase at the previously quoted prices.<p>===================================",1179418825

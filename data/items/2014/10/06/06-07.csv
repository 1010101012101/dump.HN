I&#x27;m sure facebook&#x27;s spend is not even a miniscule amount of what any public transportation project would take.<p>It&#x27;s quite amazing that these companies provide commuter buses, and that&#x27;s probably the best way every private company can help the community. Each one of those buses probably takes hundreds of cars off the road, easing traffic and reducing pollution. I don&#x27;t understand why the media is obsessed with viewing private buses as a symbol of privilege, and not as a practical solution to bay area&#x27;s commute problem.",1412578645

8414596,comment,8413971,8414324,1,0,cnvogel,,,"Certainly it depends. One one side, if your input data is read only once or a few times, introducing any intermediate binary format will often not be worth it, and optimizing reading the ASCII is the way to go.<p>On the other hand, if you have to crunch through huge amounts of locally stored data, try to make most of your binary file-format resemble the in-memory layout as closely as possible. That way you can, with some luck, mmap() your file and just use pointers into the bulk data. Saves at least one level of copying, from the filesystem cache to application heap. Be careful with validation of lengths and offsets, though!",1412578539
8414595,comment,8414389,8414505,1,0,jackowayed,,,"Per hour rate seems somewhat misleading given the split shift. There&#x27;s 15 hours between the start of their work and the end of their work, and the gap in their day is short enough that they often can&#x27;t make great use of their break. If you were to consider all of that hard-to-use time as time on the job (since the job is the reason it&#x27;s being underutilized), it would cut their effective rate almost in half.<p>Imagine someone hired you for a job where they wanted you 10 minutes out of every 20--10 minutes working, 10 minutes off, repeat. You might have a day where you clock 6 hours, but it would essentially be a 12-hour day at a job with a lot of stops and starts. Whatever rate they claimed to pay you would be inflated by two because they were only paying you for half of your time.<p>I&#x27;m guessing something that granular is illegal, but the split shift acts similarly; there&#x27;s a big difference between working a 9-hour day straight (say with one 45-min meal break) than working a 9-hour day with a 6-hour gap in the middle, so the latter should be more highly compensated.<p>And so it&#x27;s not necessarily an economic conundrum. There&#x27;s no magical market law that says there is no bus-driving labor that could be worth more than $20 per active hour driving. Bus drivers want better compensation (or at least accommodations that make the gaps more useful to them, such as bunk beds). Facebook is surely willing to pay some amount more than they are now to continue the bus service (evidence: increased costs such as SF&#x27;s new pickup fee have not stopped bus service from growing). So Facebook could pay more due to increased driver compensation or accommodation cost, the drivers could in turn be paid more or be better accommodated, and everyone would be getting more out of the economic deal than they&#x27;re putting in.<p>The union would do what unions always do--shift some of the economic surplus that the company is currently enjoying (paying less for the bus service than the value it provides) to the workers.",1412578522

8414593,comment,8413548,8413548,1,0,jmduke,,,"I have a deep love for Vonnegut&#x27;s work, and consume it like day-old pizza: while I still haven&#x27;t read a couple of his novels (<i>Timequake</i> and <i>Galapagos</i> are the last two, I believe), he&#x27;s one of the few authors whose writing I cannot stay away from for too long.<p>Now that I am (relatively) older and the immediate luster of <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i> has worn off in the opinion of my peers, I think I have a better idea of what I love about him so much beyond his wit and style and candor -- it&#x27;s the conflict between his relentless hope for the universe and the brutal cynicism he developed during his time spent in it.  (I&#x27;m fortunate enough to have never been in a war, but I can imagine that witnessing the horrors of Dresden pretty much eradicates any aggregate good-will you might have towards the ultimate fate of humanity.)<p>My favorite portion of his writing is in an essay that&#x27;s referred to as <i>Vonnegut&#x27;s Blues for America</i> (apparently adapted from a graduation speech he gave to Eastern Washington University in 2004, three years before his passing).  The entire thing is [here](<a href=""http://www.rense.com/general69/vonnegutsblues.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rense.com/general69/vonnegutsblues.htm</a>) -- and mired with the political venom that laces most of his later stuff, but the part I love:<p><i>No matter how corrupt, greedy, and heartless our government, our corporations, our media, and our religious and charitable institutions may become, the music will still be wonderful.<p>If I should ever die, God forbid, let this be my epitaph:<p>THE ONLY PROOF HE NEEDED\nFOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD\nWAS MUSIC<p>...<p>It makes practically everybody fonder of life than he or she would be without it. Even military bands, although I am a pacifist, always cheer me up. And I really like Strauss and Mozart and all that, but the priceless gift that African Americans gave the whole world when they were still in slavery was a gift so great that it is now almost the only reason many foreigners still like us at least a little bit. That specific remedy for the worldwide epidemic of depression is a gift called the blues. All pop music today \u00AD jazz, swing, be-bop, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Stones, rock-and-roll, hip-hop, and on and on \u00AD is derived from the blues.<p>A gift to the world? One of the best rhythm-and-blues combos I ever heard was three guys and a girl from Finland playing in a club in Krakow, Poland.<p>The wonderful writer Albert Murray, who is a jazz historian and a friend of mine among other things, told me that during the era of slavery in this country \u00AD-- an atrocity from which we can never fully recover --\u00AD the suicide rate per capita among slave owners was much higher than the suicide rate among slaves.<p>Murray says he thinks this was because slaves had a way of dealing with depression, which their white owners did not: They could shoo away Old Man Suicide by playing and singing the Blues. He says something else which also sounds right to me. He says the blues can&#x27;t drive depression clear out of a house, but can drive it into the corners of any room where it&#x27;s being played. So please remember that.</i>",1412578482
8414592,comment,8413971,8414487,1,0,unwind,,,"It&#x27;s very bad.<p>Using feof() to somehow ask if a stream has reached EOF before doing any I/O is wrong. Code like this comes up very often on Stack Overflow so it seems it&#x27;s somehow intuitive for people, or suggested by some tutorials or something.<p>The purpose of feof() is to answer, after I/O has failed, if it failed due to the stream reaching EOF.<p>It&#x27;s also utterly pointless in this code, it should just <i>check the return value</i> of fscanf() and stop when it fails to convert the desired number of values. This, on the other hand, seems deeply surprising to most people, you very rarely see code that cares about the return value when scanning. Which is strange; I/O can fail.<p>Further, since fscanf() basically ignores embedded whitespace, I&#x27;m not at all sure it will do as expected and read six floats per physical line of input.<p>Lastly, yes of course it&#x27;s strange to use the super-flexible fscanf() if you&#x27;re looking for performance.",1412578467

Author&#x27;s version produces provably different results than the library one for a lot of the same inputs.<p>- The fscanf must process the format string on every call, therefore we&#x27;re not comparing the same functionality.

The problem is stated by the CEO of the contracting company very clearly:<p><i>> Jeff Leonoudakis, president of Facebook’s shuttle bus contractor, Loop Transportation, said many Facebook drivers earned $18 to $20 an hour.<p>> “We believe that we take really good care of our drivers,” Mr. Leonoudakis said. “They’re the heart of our company. Without them, we can’t provide service to our customers.”<p>> He also said Loop provided a generous medical and dental insurance plan.<p>> “We pay overtime, which most of our competitors do not pay,” Mr. Leonoudakis added, noting that the company provided vacations, sick leave and holiday pay.<p>> “In keeping with the fact that we provide this high level of wages and benefits to our drivers, I don’t think the union is necessary in this case,” he said.<p>> Mr. Leonoudakis acknowledged that the split shifts were a strain for drivers.<p>> “The split shift is a necessity — that’s what our customers are asking for,” he said. “We are trying to make the conditions as pleasant and comfortable as we can.”<p>> He added, “I don’t have an answer for” the split-shift problem. “I don’t think anyone in the industry does.”</i><p>The drivers are well compensated, have benefits, and are treated well. The only problem is that the job requires a split shift, but not much can be done about that. The company&#x27;s already having a hard time being competitive with contracts - putting 2 drivers per shift would probably make the company non-competitive for contracts.<p>The job has a clear downside, but that&#x27;s just how it is and the company tries to make it as comfortable for the employees as it can.<p>If it&#x27;s really a problem for the employees, isn&#x27;t that where the free labor market would allow them to quit their job and look for something more in tune with their preferences?<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to replies to my comment because I&#x27;m having a hard time seeing the magical cure here.

And while, contrary to your argument here, you actually stand a fair chance of the end user realizing it&#x27;s the printer drivers that suck and not your OS, the cries of &quot;Windows sucks now&quot; are the fault of nobody but Microsoft.",1412575429

There were certainly bright and talented individuals, but the inability to rely on any given level of competence was maddening.  I think it was made all the worse by a cultural fear of challenging authority that made them extremely averse to admitting any inability to understand or comply with direction.   They would all smile and tell me they understood everything and then produce code with basic flaws that proved they didn't understand anything, even core concepts that were well within the supposed certifications they had.  It took a lot of time but eventually they became a reasonably productive team, but I'd hesitate to recommend any company go this route unless it's a major and long term project because the overhead of getting through it all is enormous.",1245714539

I had a cofounder but he is soon departing, so out of respect for him I'll try to keep things anonymous.]<p>Question: Is it realistic to expect to find (or retain) a Wozniak-caliber cofounder for my web startup before the technical work becomes challenging and interesting? For my startup this could be 6-12 months after launch.<p>Background: I'm mid-20's, have liberal arts degree, been part of startup scene in major US city for 2.5 years; been failing ""quickly and often"" while bootstrapping. This January I finally attracted a Woz-caliber technical cofounder (50/50 split). We were same age, single, shared same values, both had part-time jobs to cover expenses, and I thought were both passionate about the vision and building this company into the next Apple or Google or whatever. All was good for 4 months. // Then he says he's bored out of his mind and can't finish the 2-3 weeks of work for the alpha launch. He can't imagine building features for a year while waiting for the big problems to emerge. So he's left to find a startup that, in his own words, ""would make me want to pour my soul into it at the cost of something else.""<p>So if he can't see past the ""boring"" work, is there anyone of his caliber who would? Or should I just expect not to find a proper cofounder until the work gets interesting for someone like him?",1245713315

669562,comment,668030,668154,0,0,cma,,,"> I do not find, however, much evidence to support the idea that physician reimbursement has anything to do with our high national health costs.<p>Really?  I have read that the increases in the mean wage of doctors have outpaced or at least tracked medical inflation at least since Bush took office.  Given that doctor salaries are a major component of health care costs, there aren't too many ways that that can not have <i>anything</i> to do with our national health costs.<p>In general, doctors in the US make close to twice as much as doctors in other rich countries, while enduring similar costs of living.  Doctor salaries definitely aren't the whole picture--we also spend almost twice as much per patient on prescription drugs along with twice as much on bureaucratic overhead.<p>Drug costs:<p>The NSF funds a near majority of the drug research that is done in the US (and this doesn't include much of their basic biology research even when it later proves crucial for drugs), and meanwhile drug companies spend close to 50% of their budgets on sales and marketing.  Of the research that they do carry out, a large portion of it is on developing clone drugs to get around other drug companies' patents.  Some portion of their research budgets also go into things which in a sane world I could have categorized under marketing and sales without drawing comment: stuff like cures for baldness.<p>Overhead:\nI don't know a lot of details about why the bureaucratic overhead is so much higher; I've heard some handwaving on lawyer costs involved in eeking out payments from estates during medical bankruptcy, the costs of dealing with multiple insurers, etc., but I haven't seen any hard numbers itemizing these things.  I do know that malpractice isn't a significant part of it: around the time Bush came into office touting his catch-all solution to the problem of rising health care costs--malpractice reform--the ratio of malpractice judgments in dollars to national health care spending was around 0.60%.  I don't know if that included settlements, but there is a pretty decent upper bound on what settlements/judgments could have been in total: the ratio of the amount spent by doctors on malpractice insurance premiums vs. national healthcare spending was 1%.",1245712256

669551,comment,669276,669276,0,0,frossie,,,"Can you go away and come back with an easier question?<p>Seriously, there are two cases here. First, the idea that developing countries (I believe the term ""non-developed"" is frowned upon) need certain skills to ""compete"" in the modern world. Now this is in some way a political or at least philosophical position, because it implies that all countries should seek growth. For example, you can imagine an island country with fertile soil where everybody makes an abundant living through agrictulture or fishing and have access to a reasonable standard of medical care. Do they need IT? Well I don't know. Depends who you ask.<p>The second case is: for the countries desiring to progress economically, is high-tech a good solution? I think there are some good examples (eg. India, South-East Asia) where the answer does seem to be yes. In particular the reason high-tech (of which IT is one part) is a good choice for a developing country is that it allows you to leapfrog certain historical stages thus eradicating your relative disadvantage faster.<p>The classic example of this is network infrastructure. The developed countries got network by literally having to dig the ground up and lay cables in order to wire up a city. Now if you were a city in a developing country that only now is getting around to be connected, you can go straight to wireless at a much lower total cost. So, the fact that you are so far behind becomes a comparative advantage - instead of being 20 years behind your developed counterpart you are suddenly only 2 years behind.<p>Of course the big issue now is energy. Suppose this afternoon someone announces a true renewable energy breakthrough - say a massively efficient but cheap to make solar cell. This kind of technology would allow a developing country to leapfrog centuries of expensive inefficient energy production (coal, oil etc) straight to the best solution. This is the great environmental fear right now - that populous countries like China and India will start laying down ""dirty"" energy infrastructures before the next best solution is invented.<p>Do you need high-tech more than hospitals? No. Does high tech help you decent hospitals faster? Many would argue yes.",1245711615

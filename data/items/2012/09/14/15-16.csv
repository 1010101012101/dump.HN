The government bailed out GM.  That's obvious.  We, the tax payers, now own some 500 million shares of the stock.  This stock would have to be sold at some $53 per share to just break even.  Google it.  We are taking a huge loss to benefit the unions.<p>Lastly, one of the reasons GM is doing well is that the government has vectored a ton of business towards GM.  We, the tax payers, are buying brand new GM cars at a time when government should be making due with what they have and save us money.  This is a secondary and never-ending bailout.<p>Translation:  We got your back.  Vote for us when the time comes.<p>Using taxpayer money to buy votes.  Brilliant.<p>Want backing articles?

4522284,comment,4521897,4522051,3,0,gardarh,,,"I don't agree with you on that point. Android layouts are designed from the beginning to handle different screen sizes and proportions, pretty much like html. One of the iPhone's strong point has always been that you can design ""pixel perfect"" apps, so that your design is exactly what users see (as a contrast in Android you have to define ""points of stretching"" for your screens).<p>The point here is that you have to create a new layout for the iPhone 5 (if you don't want your app letterboxed) and this adds an extra layer of complexity to the development. Seeing that there are also rumors about a different form factor iPad you would then have to maintain 6 different layouts (standard/retina/16:9 for iPhone, standard/retina/new layout iPad). Well or 12 if you have specific landscape layouts.<p>Designing UI on Android apps can be a pain since you don't have the ""pixel perfect"" paradigm, which is a common criticism on Android from iPhone developers, but if you manage to get them right you can get away with a single xml layout (of course, you can able to make things more complicated).<p>It seems to me that Apple are getting themselves in a bit of a mess with this. The tradeoffs with the ""pixel perfect"" method haven't really materialized until now.<p>Maybe I'm just being over pessimistic with this and it will be a non-issue, I really can't tell at this point, but I see this as the greatest issue with the iPhone 5 (which in turn is probably the reason they didn't increase the screen size earlier).",1347638048

4522276,comment,4521897,4521897,24,0,Bud,,,"A silly, trivial article with major errors or questionable fudges in basically every paragraph.<p>The writer says the phone can be summed up by an extra row of home icons; there are in fact improvements to many hardware and software facets of the device. One may not think the improvements are <i>major</i>, but denying their existence temporarily to make an argument is silliness.<p>He then gripes for two paragraphs about his own personal impressions about how Apple presents products, including one paragraph griping about a guy who is now dead, and thus presumably not responsible for the presentation in question, i.e., the iPhone 5 presentation.<p>In the next paragraph, more whining about presentation, plus a blatant lie, saying ""Apple tried to convince us that it had stolen a 16:9 display from the gods"". Apple did no such thing. I watched the entire 2-hour event. There is not a single boast about Apple magically creating 16:9, originating 16:9, or any other such nonsense. In fact, 16:9 was barely mentioned. At all. The writer is simply making it up.<p>Then griping about a Jony Ive video.<p>Then silliness about how ""Thin and light smartphones were an exciting concept a couple of years ago""; perhaps the writer hasn't noticed, but thin and light has ALWAYS been a driving concept in smartphones and basically every other kind of portable (and even non-portable) tech design. It has always been an issue and will always be an issue. So when someone makes something circa 20% thinner and lighter, yes, that is noteworthy. It will not change the course of planetary history single-handedly, but it is notable.<p>He then lies about the hardware, saying that ""you would be hard stretched to find any new features except for the single-chip GSM/CDMA/LTE radio"". But that's not true either. The CPU is reported to use A15 cores, which would make Apple first to market, but all the writer can do about that is boast of some vaporware product using the A15. The writer ignores the camera upgrades, the speaker upgrade, addition of an extra mic, etc., etc.<p>Later in the article, he gets the software wrong too, talking about how iOS will use the additional screen space: ""Rather than do something interesting with this space, though, Apple will simply letterbox all 3:2 apps"". That's already untrue; Apple has already redesigned the OS and its own apps to do interesting things with that space, and third parties who make major apps will of course do full redesigns in most cases too.<p>The author then makes a hilariously bad statement about why Apple made the phone thinner: ""It seems like Apple felt compelled to increase the iPhones screen size, but at the same time it couldnt summon up the marketing cojones to introduce a phone that was both larger and heavier than the iPhone 4S.""<p>Yeah, that's right. The author is actually saying that the phone is lighter and thinner because of Apple's lack of ""marketing cojones"".<p>It's just hilariously bad writing and control of the facts, all the way through.",1347637976

4522266,comment,4521897,4522197,7,0,cooldeal,,,">So, there is no other phone that can beat its design and construction, but ""is it enough""? Is being the best enough?<p>The Nokia N9, Lumia 800, 900 and 920 are pretty well built and designed too. If you haven't, try going to a store and playing with one.<p>Coming to the design itself, it's tied in with fashion and at this point the design has not changed(except for the new back) since the iPhone 4 over 2 years ago. Design and fashion do age. The iPhone 4's design was a leap over the 3GS and combined with other features warranted a new version number, while this iteration feels that it should've been named iPhone 4X, X for extra long. Why get a new iPhone 5 when you already have an iPhone 4 or 4S and can add a Galaxy or Lumia and keep the old phone around as a iPod Touch music player?<p>Also, even if the design is superlative and timeless, for many consumers it is just one factor. The other factors are raw power, technical specs, camera quality and features(which the Lumia 920 is going to have a head start on). If the iPhone 5 cannot compete on specs with this years phones, what chance does it have with the Android phones of the next year?<p>However, there's another bigger factor that I previously commented on:<p>I think their problem right now is that users' choice is overwhelming them and the one-size-fits-all approach of the iPhone has diminishing returns after a point. The variety, choice of screen sizes and price ranges of the competition is only getting better by the day.<p>A new iPhone is released only once a year, so it better be very good with a lot of new technologies, features, new designs etc. for sales to last all through the next year. iPhone 4S sales started lagging in the 3Q itself this year, compared to the 4th quarter for the iPhone 4. This is because people start waiting for the next version or switch to the competition because they have better specced devices with more features. I think Samsung timed their Galaxy S3 launch perfectly to coincide with the iPhone 4S getting old enough to beat, and they beat it in monthly sales for the first time, which is a noteworthy thing in itself.<p>The whole situation is reminding me of the PC wars in the 80s, where Apple had a seemingly unassailable innovation lead, and then squandered it away by offering limited choice and higher prices, while Microsoft very smartly licensed DOS to Compaq and others like Dell and HP, and the rest is history. Apple's marketshare is now 17% vs. Android's 67% which is about 4 times more. No wonder Apple is going crazy with the patent war against Android. That's probably their only weapon against the equivalent of the attack of the hordes of beige boxes' that previously took them down.<p>The iPhone 5 is good enough to get great sales and beat all sales records ever, but the key is how well it does starting about 6 months from now.",1347637877

I'd like to add something from my experience working in large development companies.<p>The first months or so, it's perfectly understandable that a new developer doesn't ""get"" the application, how it works, or even what it does. The myth of the ninja programmer turning things around, applying a mix of beautiful elegance and sharp efficiency to save the business big bucks, is just that, a myth.<p>Actually, during this period, a new recruit should focus on one thing only: survival.<p>Deliver the mindless code, even if it doesn't make sense (or seems plain wrong), but deliver it on time. Do not slack off on your hours, show up (at least) ten minutes early and leave (at least) ten minutes late. You may be the genius programmer who delivers in an hour a day's worth of an average programmer's productivity; but now's not the time for cleverness. Now, I repeat, is the time for <i>survival</i>.<p>It is also the good time for getting to know (and being accepted by) your colleagues and your direct managers. Coffee/cigarette/you-name-it breaks are important. Do not miss those.<p>So when do you get the chance to behave like the great programmer you always thought you were? From experience the milestone has always been the same: The next batch of recruits (which in my case has always been around 8-12 months in large enterprises).<p>As soon as you're not the ""new guy"" anymore, things automatically change. Not only have you already earned the acceptance and trust of people around you, but you've also seen enough of the code and interacted enough with business analysts. You have much more elements in hand to be creative and take initiatives.<p>In short, I'd add one thing to this article: Be patient. \nIt's true that you can never see the whole picture, but as time passes, you can definitely detect the places where you can have an impact. Until then, you simply have to turn on your survival mode.",1347637732

But once you start digging deeper, the usefulness becomes readily apparent.<p>Algorithms is an especially problematic topic, for a couple of reasons.  The first is that the entire topic is built on top of a good foundation of discrete math, big-O, set and graph theory, and with a sprinkling of data structures on the side.  So it's no a topic that you can just jump into immediately.  There's a lot of background study needed before you can really start working on it.<p>The second is that to really understand an algorithm, you really need to be able to make(or understand) the proof of correctness and proof of efficiency.  The goal of the student looking into algorithms shouldn't be just to get a laundry list of potential things to use(though they will get that as well), but to have the skills to be able to show that their algorithm will work correctly for all valid inputs, and that it's capable of doing so at a certain efficiency.  That's the mindset of a good programmer, and it definitely comes with experience, but I think having the theoretical background helps a lot as well.",1347637271

The reason is because there's a much larger common footprint of what a website needs to do than what javascript needs to do.  Is it a single page app or a full site?  How much JS code is there?  Is it a lot of CRUD or is a more minimal crafted UI?  Is it progressively enhanced or not?  What other technologies are in the mix?<p>All of these affect the needs of a particular site's JS implementation, and even assuming that all JS framework authors are smarter and more knowledgeable than me (which is a dubious assumption btw), they may or may not have taken into account any of the conditions and constraints that are now staring me in the face.<p>As to leaving crappy legacy stuff behind, well, frameworks don't save you from that.  For a simple app written by a beginner there's a good chance I'd prefer maintaining the 10-year-old PHP version to the 5-year-old Ruby version.

Apple are known for innovation and inspiring design. The iPhone 5 only innovates with its acceptance of the new 4G LTE standard, which is brilliant. In other areas it's rejected innovations like wireless charging and NFC payments. The criticism is well earned because these innovations will be held back without Apple's much needed support. Apple have also missed a trick by introducing anything completely new to the mainstream this time around, but we can't blame them too much for that, we can't expect miracles like Siri every time.<p>2. They're also being criticised for how obvious they've made their efforts to milk their fanbase for money this time round. The adapter debacle, smaller, but for no functional reason. It means a whole host of accessories will no longer work, stereos, speakers, docks, chargers etc. Adapters can be bought, but they'll ruin clean attachments and aesthetics. Couple that with the seemingly identical look of the phone and people are left wondering why this is the iPhone 5 and not just another incarnation of the 4.<p>It may well be a good phone, after all it's only been improved. But Apple have a lot more than that to live up to. I could forgive them partially if they were at the top of their game, but they're not, Samsung, HTC and Nokia are still producing better phones, and for better value. Apple are coasting with this phone, which could be dangerous considering how desperate HTC and Nokia are to prove themselves especially.<p>Apple can't afford to be complacent right now, they now that their fanatic fanbase run on fads and fashions, and by stagnating their phone line with this update that fanatacism could threaten to perform a shift to another manufacturer. I'd predict Samsung, if they can move away from Apple-ish designs.",1347636276

An average person would most likely have one home to live. So a platform should provide enough comfort and trust-worthy mechanism for users to adopt. I guess every blogging platform started with this vision but over time, they lost trust-worthiness and a feel of comfort for users (unless you self-host).<p>It didn't feel right when Blogger was littered with neighbors who were spammers and pornographers, although blogspot was a fine and crisp start.<p>The guinea-pig aspect of Wordpress.com and their lack of control for user over their own blogs is another negative.  I don't know much about Tumblr and others so I won't speak about them.<p>Ultimately, if you are providing blogging services as a platform for users to adopt, than you have to ensure that your ground has a solid foundation for users to build their houses.",1347635251

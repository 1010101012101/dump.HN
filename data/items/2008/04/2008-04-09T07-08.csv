158659,comment,158008,158454,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Forgive me, because this is not an insult, but this ""doesn't make conceptual sense"" argument I hear so much is so much nonsense and excuses to me. Git supports multiple workflows and allows you to either directly resolve tainted-working-copy situations directly or avoid them.<p>By allowing for local branches you enable multiple parallel lines of development in one repository. It saves space, it saves effort, it saves time, and it's a cleaner way to organize your projects (all in one place rather than scatted across a directory listing). It also means you can evade the tainted-working-copy problem entirely by keeping short-lived, private, parallel branches of current feature development. Personally, I much prefer this mode of operation when I have the foresight to do it.",1207727756

Scaling stuff up is a pain, and something a lot of people (myself included) have only taken so far.",1207727656

Google tries to be at a class above everyone else down to their company motto of ""Do no Evil"".  Whether it was a few guys working off the clock or using their 20% time at work it was still Google that released it.<p>Don't get me wrong, I do think Google has a right to release competing products and they have done so with Gmail and many other apps.  However, it's a very crappy message to send would-be developers to ""trust"" them to do the right thing.  Let's not lose perspective just because you may or may not like the 37 Signals guys, it was a pretty crappy message to chance sending.",1207726551

You don't really get a sense of it until you have a real social circle on it, though; currently it's not super easy to add friends or import lots of friends at once, so your crowdspace isn't immediately useful. The global ""universe"" feed is kind of cool but not everyone wants to talk to strangers.

158631,comment,158531,158531,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I don't think there are any official government agencies that let you report fraudulent sites to them. Your best bet is to go to the commercial providers of anti-phishing software (IE, FF and the addons that seek out phishing sites, etc...) and contact them. I believe many of these have a process for users to submit their sites.<p>On a ""fight fire with fire"" note, see what you can find about this site. Do a whois lookup (probably won't find much, if they know what they're doing). You may be able to find their hosting company and contact them directly. Also see if you can find where the site is hosted geographically. This will give you an advantage of knowledge should you need to take any legal action (a host in Utah is easier to fight legally than an off-shore one). I also like the suggestion about creating a script to bombard their servers with false registrations - maybe as a last resort thing...but maybe not. :)<p>Also, would you mind sharing the sites with us (both yours and the bogus one)? I would personally like to see how this site is trying to phish information from your visitors.",1207724682

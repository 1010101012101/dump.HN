Google has actually opened the door for companies to now make money on the wearables hardware since the software is standard. While Google launched wearable by focusing on the Now integration, there are still hints that fitness apps will be there at launch of the smartwatches. This is the first time Google and Apple are launching in a new category at the same time, it&#x27;s a bit premature to conclude that Apple will capture the high-end (although they do have iOS customer captive in their ecosystem)<p>Nike doesn&#x27;t figure into this at all. The fuelband never even worked with Android devices (Tim Cook holding a spot on the Nike board for the past 9 years might do something with that). Mike&#x27;s play is to get out of the wristband business before Apple jumps in while keeping their Nike+ integration with Apple via software and SHOES (Nike&#x27;s real business) as done previously.

Besides the complete fear that is instilled in my heart because this building was built in a flawed way it also has an absolute terrible elevator design.<p>The elevators are double-deckers. So the elevator actually has two rooms that move together. In the morning if you want to go to an even floor you have to enter from the basement level and if you want to go to an odd floor you have to enter from the lobby level. This results in the weird sensation that if you are going to a higher floor the elevators often stop but the doors do not open. Probably related to the weird design the elevators break down often and with or without an elevator set out of commission there are high queue times during peak hours. This is a building that could REALLY benefit from an elevator call system where you enter a floor and it assigns you which elevator to get into to. Why they haven&#x27;t installed a relatively simple fix like this is beyond me.<p>My final gripe about this building is its sheer ugliness IMHO. The steel facade pegs it as one of those buildings that was built in a particularly time. It&#x27;s not timeless like the Empire State Building or perpetually modern like the Willis Tower or One World Trade center.<p>I guess its only redeeming factor is the very nice public plaza it has both inside and outside, its direct access to the E and 6 trains (super convenient for me), and the fact that it has not fallen down yet.",1397922348

7613668,comment,7612686,7613105,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> I think the real answer is compulsory licensing of patents.<p>The trouble with compulsory licensing is that it doesn&#x27;t solve one of the most fundamental problems with software patents, which is how do you set the price? An iPhone is probably covered by some tens of thousand of patents. How much of the value of the iPhone should be attributed to each patent? There are too many patents to spend any real resources evaluating each individual patent; the lawyers fees would surpass the royalties. On the other hand, not looking closely creates a powerful market incentive (which is what has been happening) to file for thousands of low-quality patents, and thwarts the patent incentive to make significant inventions because high-quality patents requiring significant R&D are awarded no additional royalties over the crap.<p>On top of that, circumstances change quickly, and how do you respond to that? If you establish royalties for specific patents one year and the next year the new model comes out which is covered by all the old patents plus thousands of new ones, do the old patent holders get less money for the same patents until the royalties from a patent fall below the cost of filing for one, or does the price of a phone keep going up until they each cost $100,000 and everyone is forced to go back to pen and paper? And what do we do about free software -- percentage of zero and no money for the patent holder or fixed fee and free software ceases to exist?<p>Compulsory licensing can&#x27;t fix software patents. They probably can&#x27;t <i>be</i> fixed. The patent system was never designed to apply to products with zero marginal cost and a combinatorial explosion of patent liability.",1397922034

One of the disadvantages with custom bindings is that they are rather tightly bound to how the view model looks. If your binding expects something which isn&#x27;t directly in your view model (at the right level) and perhaps requires a little transformation of your view model, you sometimes end up adding &quot;synthetic&quot; computed observables just to transform from your real view model to the view model that the custom binding expects. This is not really encapsulated very well. (I hope that makes sense, it&#x27;s kind of hard for me to explain.)<p>In React it&#x27;s just simple JS which you write exactly where you need it, namely where you instantiate your component --  it doesn&#x27;t even have to escape the scope (vs. KO where it &quot;pollutes&quot; the view model in the &quot;owning&quot; component so to speak).<p>EDIT: A little addendum: It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used KO in any serious way, but another issue is that of embedding <i>arbitrary</i> components inside another.

It may not be interesting to a lot of beginners, many of which probably want to immediately start doing something &quot;interesting&quot;, but these are the fundamental basics that anyone claiming to have a CS degree should know.<p>Starting with higher-level languages tends to breed more misconceptions, because the students get used to seeing things &quot;seem to work like this&quot;, and having only a vague, superficial understanding, it is much harder to unlearn these than to learn the truth in the beginning.<p>It&#x27;s also not as if things like logic, data representation, and the sequential nature of programs don&#x27;t matter at higher levels --- whenever one uses conditional statements and loops, a good grasp of boolean logic is essential. Why numbers have a finite range, floating point values aren&#x27;t exact, etc. all depend on knowing how data is represented. Not knowing these things will at best make it difficult to reason about code, and increase the chance of introducing bugs; at worst, it can lead to security flaws.",1397920407

But the engineering seems fixated on mechanically hooking everything together with heavy frameworks, even having cargo building where arriving pods get racked.<p>Turns out space is big; things don&#x27;t go anywhere if you just put them nearby. So no need to have buildings to store them.<p>And thousands of independently-operating solar cells would work as well as a big rigid frame. Why not have each cell in a swarm beam its energy to a single large transmission facility? No need to wire-and-bolt them together.<p>Probably its improvements in compute power that made this inconceivable decades ago. But now it seems obvious.",1397920328

Did you see how lightly he was swinging it for the inner splits?  Other commenters talking about the extreme accuracy, but that&#x27;s easier when you are hitting it so lightly.<p>Look, I don&#x27;t regularly split wood, but I&#x27;ve spent several summers splitting wood before.  And I&#x27;ve split unseasoned gnarly pine with a wedge and sledge.  I am not completely ignorant on the subject.<p>So my question is why you dismiss it outright just because the demo uses favorable wood?

A product &quot;grows up&quot; as its original user cohort grows up, and that&#x27;s OK.<p>I saw this in the music creation software space. Products start simple out of necessity. They are a good fit for a cohort of users with simple needs. But as the user cohort advances, they need and want more powerful features. Typically companies add the features to create a &quot;more professional&quot; product, rather than see their existing users jump to a competitor.<p>Of course after (say) 5 years of this, the product is no longer such a great fit for &quot;beginners&quot;. So it creates space for a new product to step in, and with a fresh approach. Of course that <i>new</i> product will eventually accrete more features, too. Some manage it better than others, but they all become more complex. And so the wheel turns again.<p>At the same time, plugins provide a safety valve, as well as a way to form partnerships. Plugins can be a way to give certain features an &quot;audition&quot; before maybe rolling them into the product itself (or bundling the plugin, maybe with somewhat tighter integration than before).<p>TL;DR Products have a natural cohort of users. If the users grow up, the products do, too. Also plugins.",1397919846

Sometimes there's two or three quick, reflexive downmods that can dent your self-esteem, but often your comment's opinion-o-meter will rise hours later, and leave you feeling rather silly if you added another comment just to complain about downmods.",1221656361

306959,comment,306488,306488,0,0,tel,,,"Good design is prescient of an audience, yes. Often, however, good design applies widely to audiences it was never intended for.<p>For instance, OXO brand kitchen supplies were designed to be big and easy to handle for the arthritic. I own a lot of their supplies because they're sturdy and easy to handle. I never use it and think ""Wow. I'm feeling arthritic today""<p>Similarly, Apple. Designing to make computing cool and succeeding wildly probably means the design will apply to a large number of unintended audiences as well. If you wear a suit and are professional, a glowing apple is still going to look better than a clunky black box.",1221656045

Being a Black American correlates negatively with income, and positively with low birth weight and infant mortality (note that Black Americans have an infant mortality rate of 16/1000, vs about 7/1000 among White Americans).<p>With such large confounding factors, how can you draw the conclusion you seem to be implying?",1221655921

306949,comment,306933,306933,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"What a wonderful idea. Why didn't anybody think of that in the 200+ years of publishing?<p>Perhaps because it's specious? In the article the author mentions ""Swift Boat"" -- I think this is an excellent example of the problem. The Swift Boat ads were seen mainly by one party as being fallacious. To use a recent example, when candidate A says Candidate B voted for sex education for Kintergartners, Candidate B replies it was age-appropriate. Then Candidate A shows the exact wording of the bill, which calls for a discussion of the transmission vectors for HIV.<p>Everybody can pile on to me about how my examples suck, but you're just reinforcing the point: there is no universal truth squad that could un-tangle all of this rhetoric. That's what you, the voter are supposed to be doing. Stop looking to somebody else to do one of the few things you have a duty to do in a democracy.<p>Sorry for the rant. The article just struck me as a great example of the great gap between what passes as common sense and what would actually work.",1221654844

306944,comment,306438,306563,0,0,netcan,,,"<i>A competitive free market is more likely to develop better medicine.</i><p>Well, yes & no. A free market does develop <i>good</i> medicine in much the same way as it develops good everything else. But what you are usually measuring something essentially different when evaluating medicine.<p>You could say that a free market system should produce <i>more</i> medicine. But (as free markets do) this is distributed unevenly among the population. that's OK when you are talking about shoes. Your free market will produce more shoes then a nationalised shoe industry. But a lot of those will end up in the closets with 20+ pairs or in the form of $500 shoes. Same with medicine.<p>The US is a good place to go if you want $10m surgery. But if you are measuring public health: life expectancy, infant mortality, death from preventable diseases, & such a $1 at the bottom goes a lot further then $1 at the top. The gains made from flattening the system, generally outweigh the lost effeciency.",1221654378

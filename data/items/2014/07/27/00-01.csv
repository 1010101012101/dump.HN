I&#x27;d <i>really</i> appreciate it if you didn&#x27;t condescend me by trying to explain my own wealth percentile, as if I&#x27;m completely oblivious to being showered in money (as you&#x27;re implying), when I&#x27;ve simply made a remark about the average price of an item of clothing. That was quite an insulting comment to get through, and I hope you realize that even if you didn&#x27;t intend it.<p>I&#x27;d also challenge your assertion that the majority of the HN audience is elite, as that&#x27;s a bit of projection, but that&#x27;s not a fight I&#x27;m prepared to get pulled into right now.<p>I&#x27;ve spent my entire life at just about every notch on the wealth spectrum short of having seven figures in the bank (and I came from stretching $10 for a family of three over two weeks), and I would consider myself upper middle class at this very moment, yet one constant for me has been the price for an average article of clothing even if the purchaser had to save up for it.",1406422738

I find it extremely hard to believe that a significant portion of people pay taxes because of social pressure and convention rather than the fear of punishment.<p>A reasonable thought experiment is to imagine what would happen if the government convincingly announced that it would no longer perform <i>any</i> physical enforcement of any laws. I for one wouldn&#x27;t immediately go out and murder or burgle anyone, because my reasons for not doing those things are firstly my ethical intuition that such an act is wrong and secondly the fact that people are likely to fight back. But you better believe that I would immediately disregard some laws, particularly ones prohibiting so-called victimless crimes.<p>I would make essentially the exact opposite argument as you. I think that most people believe that government is not primarily in power because of violence, I think they&#x27;re wrong, and I think history (ancient to modern) makes it extremely clear that they&#x27;re wrong.",1406422706

It&#x27;s rare that cops ticket safe drivers for speeding, but it happens (IME, about once every 5 years). Tickets themselves weren&#x27;t a big deal if you&#x27;re a good driver who gets unlucky occasionally, until insurance got involved and started hiking up the prices. Depending on your state and insurance policy, a $100 speeding ticket can end up costing $1,000 or more.<p>&quot;Police oppression&quot; might be a bit farther than I&#x27;d go, because I rarely get speeding tickets.

This seems to contradict your statement that there is not an increased risk with marijuana use.

It says:<p>> Experimental studies have shown modest functional impairment, but debate exists over how well these experimental studies translate into real-life driving situations (41). Epidemiologic studies, however, have shown contradictory results (39, 42, 43). ... it is unclear whether marijuana plays a significant role in crash causation.<p>The paper itself is a meta-analysis. They write:<p>> Results of this meta-analysis indicate that marijuana use by drivers is associated with a significantly increased risk of crash involvement. Specifically, drivers who test positive for marijuana or self-report using marijuana are more than twice as likely as other drivers to be involved in motor vehicle crashes.<p>It then very emphatically points out that this conclusion is not strong enough for public policy decisions, and that there are many possible confounding factors.<p>This conclusion is also mentioned in the NYT link you posted: &quot;Still, it is clear that marijuana use causes deficits that affect driving ability, Dr. Huestis said. She noted that several researchers, working independently of one another, have come up with the same estimate: a twofold increase in the risk of an accident if there is any measurable amount of THC in the bloodstream.&quot;<p>Thus, I think it&#x27;s enough to suggest that your first line is likely incorrect.",1406421755

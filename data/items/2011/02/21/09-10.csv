2244901,comment,2244304,2244690,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"That might be a deeper question about the nature of the Universe.<p>Newton's first law (inertia): an object in motion tends to stay in motion. This gives rise to the idea of an ""inertial reference frame"" which is the idealized reference of a hypothetical object in motion. In simplistic terms, if you pretend that the Universe is merely Newtonian in nature and contains a preferred reference frame then you could imagine that an inertial reference frame can be described by a velocity vector (a speed and a direction). If an object has zero speed relative to the inertial reference frame that will tend to continue to be true so long as no forces intervene.<p>If you induce an acceleration on an object you will change it's velocity. In it's initial inertial reference frame it will appear to be accelerating. In any other inertial reference frame it will also appear to be accelerating.<p>There is no such thing as an accelerating inertial reference frame precisely because such a frame is not inertial, it would imply that forces are being applied to the objects involved. The laws of physics make sense if you apply them within any inertial reference frame, but they don't make sense in accelerating reference frames (mass, energy, and forces become inconsistent and confused).<p>Does that make sense?",1298282247

In the book, he takes a genuine question about the nature of things (how does light work?) and answers it by ""bringing up paper and arrows!"" (I encourage you to read the book to see what I mean).

Seriously?!\nPersonally, whenever I see logic implemented in a markup language, it makes me wanna scream. That's simply not what they were designed for.<p>As far as I'm concerned there's only one time when you're better of programming in XML and that's when doing GUIs. That's because XML lends itself naturally to GUI programming.

Samsung's own Galaxy S II phone will replace the next generation A4 with Nvidia's Tegra2 in some territories, that's how interchangeable a commodity it is.

Like it very much and definitely worth checking out IMHO:<p>Cyclone is a low-level network toolkit, which provides support for HTTP 1.1 in an API very similar to the one implemented by the Tornado web server - which was developed by FriendFeed and later released as open source / free software by Facebook.<p>Key differences between Cyclone and Tornado<p><pre><code>    * Cyclone is based on Twisted, hence it may be used as a webservice protocol for interconnection with any other protocol implemented in Twisted.\n    * Localization is based upon the standard Gettext instead of the CSV implementation in the original Tornado. Moreover, it supports pluralization exactly like Tornado does.\n    * It ships with an asynchronous HTTP client based on TwistedWeb, however, it's fully compatible with one provided by Tornado - which is based on PyCurl. (The HTTP server code is NOT based on TwistedWeb, for several reasons)\n    * Native support for XMLRPC and JsonRPC. (see the rpc demo)\n    * WebSocket protocol class is just like any other Twisted Protocol (i.e.: LineReceiver; see the websocket demo)\n    * Support for sending e-mail based on Twisted Mail, with authentication and TLS, plus an easy way to create plain text or HTML messages, and attachments. (see the e-mail demo)\n    * Built-in support for Redis, based on txredisapi. We usually need an in-memory caching server like memcache for web applications. However, we prefer redis over memcache because it supports more operations like pubsub, various data types like sets, hashes (python dict), and persistent storage. See the redis demo for details.\n    * Support for HTTP Authentication. See the authentication demo for details.\n</code></pre>\nAdvantages of being a Twisted Protocol<p><pre><code>    * Easy deployment of applications, using twistd.\n    * RDBM support via: twisted.enterprise.adbapi.\n    * NoSQL support for MongoDB (TxMongo) and Redis (TxRedisAPI).\n    * May combine many more functionality within the webserver: sending emails, communicating with message brokers, etc...\n\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""https://github.com/fiorix/cyclone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fiorix/cyclone</a>",1298279449

I'd like this paper a little bit more if it had said something about this, but the final thought that <i>Packages control how  the  reader maps  strings  onto  symbols  (and how  PRINT maps  symbols  onto strings),  nothing  else.</i> is I think helps appreciate the point.",1298279410

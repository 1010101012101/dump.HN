The developer can say ""I'm 50% done, can I please have half my pledge money?"" And he'll get half his money if the pledgers are okay with his progress (if they're not, he might only get a portion of his money till they are happy).<p>2) The share-the-burden thing -- especially if you're talking big pledges. You could have your $10,000 split across 5 people/companies (or more, of course).<p>The Credibility Thing is a good point, and something we're very conscious of. We're going to be very open about who we are and where we live. And (very soon) we're also going to look into getting our money flow audited annually by a company like Grant Thornton.<p>P.S. Just wondering if you have a contact email/website somewhere? Didn't see one on your profile page.",1184047143

They may seem a bit negative towards you but its their job to take a critical angle.<p>In other words, be cool and dont take stabs at your idea personal. Chances are, the comments they're making turn out true anyway so heed the advice.",1184045462
33413,comment,33384,33384,0,0,staunch,,,"Very nice. I'm excited about this because I've sponsored some open source development and never had an easy way to do it.<p>Here what I've done: I use a piece of open source software. I want the developers to implement a feature that will be very useful to me. I offer to pay a considerable amount of money. They agree. I send them half. They complete it. I send them the other half.<p>A system that would let me share the financial burden and handle the whole process would be very useful. I said before that I think you should expect to see much bigger pledges than you're thinking right now. As a business, pledging $10k for a feature that saves me having to buy an extra $50k in servers is a no-brainer.<p>If you're going to be actually holding the money you will need to be extremely credible and your reputation spotless. A picture of who you are, your office (if you have one), street address, phone number, and that kind of stuff goes a long way. I want to make sure the authorities can find you if you do anything evil.\n",1184045122

33411,comment,33322,33406,0,0,jmclain,,,"Yes, you can't really think of PayFloPro as PayPal.  It is an actual merchant account.  You obtain full credit card authorizations and can run reports to reconcile things through the API.  The only thing to be mindful of is that the libraries they provide for using the APIs are pretty much either C or Java (I want to say PHP also, but I am not 100%).  If you do not use the libraries I am pretty sure you can use URL strings to pass data back and forth.",1184044233

That's the best justification I can think of anyway.<p>I'm just scared he said ""staff up"" since that always seems to mean hiring the worst kind of people. Anyone know if he's still writing any code at all these days?\n",1184043706

1006115,comment,1005924,1005929,0,0,hga,,,"Well, one of the issues is magnitude: do we get, naturally or unnaturally, temperatures back to the level of the Medieval Warm Period or do we get a ""cataclysm"" (or do we get the next Ice Age, we <i>are</i> overdue one, and the same general group of people and some of the same people were warning of that before the '80s).<p>""Worth doing something"" is nice and fine, but that ""something"" really needs to be connected to the probability of the risk.  The extreme warmists want us to essentially spend all the world's disposable wealth on something that has at best a <i>very</i> shaky scientific foundation (cataclysm).  It would be a real pity if we did that and it turned out we were entering the next Ice Age instead, or needed the money for some other greater threat instead (e.g. one of the ones mentioned in this discussion, like a megacaldera cutting lose).  A maxim of warfare is that the side that tends to win in a battle is the one that is the last to commit its reserves.  We <i>really</i> need to keep some reserves.<p>In the HN discussion in which you posted a pointer to this discussion I referred to Bj√∏rn Lomborg, ""The Skeptical Environmentalist"".  Back before the release of the CRUtape Letters he believed moderate AGW was happening, but he advocates moderate local expenditures to deal with that (moderate at least when compared to the ""take over the world's economy"" proposals of the extreme warmists), and that we spend some serious money on targeted interventions that will clearly help a lot of people (e.g. as I vaguely recall one involves addressing a common vitamin deficiency).<p>Unless a threat is truly cataclysmic it's a mistake to focus on it to the exclusion of all else, and the extreme warmists are just one example of an advocacy group that thinks they've found the <i>one</i> problem we're facing.",1261316414

1006107,comment,1004701,1005746,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I suspect it might be fruitful to do static analysis for constraints, with type identity as just one attribute. While inferring that X is an int is useful, inferring that it's an int which is always positive and less than 256 would allow a lot of other optimizations. Even if an inference engine can't completely prove something is always a (string * int list) pair, it would still be useful to know that it's (string * (either int or double) list), and the list cannot be empty. Etc. Type declarations or inference are a bit all-or-nothing, and I think being able to read through the properties that the compiler could infer (or at least confirm) would help find bugs, suggest optimizations, etc.<p>If I ever get past the first dozen projects on my list, I'd like to write a compiler for a dialect of Prolog designed with constraint analysis in mind. (I also need to read more about what's already been tried, first - this is just me being curious about how far constraint analysis could go and wondering out loud.) It would be tricky, but more feasible with Prolog-like semantics than in, say, C.",1261315982

1006097,comment,1005464,1005946,0,0,kunley,,,"Yeah it's a bit sad if people really downvote like that.<p>Anyway I'd like to have another point for the people who may think I desecrated holy shrine of Haskell. It's a quite long response and may seem like bashing but there's a conclusion at the end, so if you'd like to downvote please read to the end at least.<p>GHC is very nice piece of high-tech. I like coding in it and I am looking forward to have new cases when it would be the right choice. But there are not many, in my case.<p>Some of the difficulties are in the people's attitude which determines the quality of tools, docs and stuff. Most coders don't have big expectations: apart from the toolchain to create the code they need a platform to share the pieces of code they create. Such platform can be loved or hated (Gems, CPAN are mostly loved, Maven is mostly hated). What do we have here in Haskell world? Cabal, pretty coll stuff, except of one thing: upgrade is broken, so you have to eventually take care of your packages by hand. So it started great, but the actual implementation didn't catch some quality and nobody seems to care.<p>Next thing, a bigger piece of code: Darcs. Great idea, had some performance issues, probably fixed recently. Well it seems that at the time they were fixed lots of people didn't care as they were using git already. Yeah, git, whose manpage says it's ""the stupid content tracker"" and it really is. It has nothing like theory of patches which finds the coupling of code changes automagically. But git established some good practices which actually enable people to manage code changes in a very sophisticated way, even if these are crude hacks the end user doesn't see it. So git won. Worse is better? Maybe just pragmatic is better?<p>Now the cited Happstack & macid. Another cool piece of high tech which seems a bit unfinished (those limits and scalability issues). it's perfectly ok that something is unfinished. In fact, it's great that the authors were kind enough to share their hard work. But let's look what's the general attitude towards fixing the issues. It isn't: ""let us help get rid of these issues"". It's: ""There are issues and I don't care, and you shouldn't care too"". WTF?<p>Do you see a common pattern in those 3 examples?\n- great theoretical idea\n- nice implementation, but reached some limit\n- ""we left the rest as an exercise"", ""we really don't care"", ""it's cool already because it's Haskell""<p>Got it?<p>Looks like if you want to participate in improving the actual Haskell stuff you have no choice but accept such attitude. Which is unacceptable for many coders around, I guess. If you ask me, I tried, but was turned off. I can sacrifice my time for learning state monads as the knowledge gained will benefit me anyway, but I don't want to waste my time struggling with people's defeatist attitude.<p>Now the political incorrect rant ends. You can start breathing normally ;)",1261315520

You need to make points by making blocks disappear. To do this you have the piece at the top of your screen. Click where you want to drop it.<p>Now all blocks under and on the same row will shrink.

1006089,comment,1005607,1005866,0,0,robotrout,,,"> deeply unsatisfying to ""solve"" the problem by blindly copying nature<p>The image that jumped to my mind, was the wing flapping airplane prototypes that, quite literally, never got off the ground, and that we all laugh at today.<p>Perhaps, in the end, our solution won't match natures.<p>That also leads me to another thought, which is the definition of the problem.<p>Going back to the airplane.  If the problem had been defined as ""to build a machine with birdlike agility and control"", than we still wouldn't be there.  Instead of patting ourselves on the backs, we would still be miserably failing, over 100 years later.  But we didn't really need birdlike agility, we just wanted to fly, which, it turns out, is much easier.<p>The problem statement for a lot of AI research seems similarly ambitious.  Do we really want to create some sentient being, trapped in a box?  Or is what we're really after, a little more practical and obtainable?<p>I think folks like the military, get this.

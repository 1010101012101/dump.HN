832366,comment,832222,832354,0,0,ovi256,,,"They have an online self-care system - you use it to signal a problem and the system runs diags on the Freebox, phone line etc. Yup, completely automated.<p>Unfortunately, if your problem falls between the cracks (something new, that is not in their list of common troubles) then it can get tricky, and you need to replace the Freebox. They'll replace it for free, of course, but it's still a hassle make the demand, get the delivery (UPS usually), install the new Freebox, send the old one in. This is all completely automated again, and the Freebox warehouse is outsourced to a specialized company. Free only has engineers : hardware, software and (lots and lots of) telecom guys. BTW, one of their top VPs wore a teeshirt saying ""Go away, or I will replace you with a small shell script"". So yeah, these guys love automation, they are hardcore engineers, nerdy to the core.<p>Anecdote : some time ago they launched a new version of the Freebox. It was supposed to be for new subscribers and replacements. People (especially geeks, but mostly everybody) asked for replacements, because the new version had a bigger harddrive and some new features. Free had to replace many more Freeboxes that forecasted. So many of the consumer reports among the lines of ""My Freebox broke so I had to have it replaced"" should be more like ""I invented a problem to get the free upgrade"".<p>Furthermore, you can replace the HDD with a bigger one or connect an external HDD - that's how you recognize a geek in Paris - his ADSL modem is tuned.",1253397366

832350,comment,832222,832222,0,0,ovi256,,,"There is a small mistake in the description of the Free subscription : the broadband is 20 Mbits per second, not 2.<p>Personal remark : this guy is freaking awesome, always seeking to disrupt markets to lower prices. The Free triple-play subscription (unlimited broadband, cable TV + free phone calls to most of the world) is so cheap it's a freaking no-brainer. Before, it used to be an exercise in comparison shopping : what operators are available in my area, are they good, what are the prices. Now, you just get Free and stop worrying. They have a bad reputation for customer service, because, just as Google, they like to automate everything (heard that their back-office is huuuuuge).<p>If he could get the license and disrupt the mobile telecom market, that would be great.<p>About the Freebox, the set-top box they provide to subscribers : as if everything they do is not hard enough, they designed custom hardware and software for their combined set-top box/cablemodem. Ok, the UI is not Apple level, but it provides lots of awesome stuff : a TiVo like DVR, video broadcasting, FTP and HTTP servers, a Wifi (802.11-N !) access point, a router and more.",1253396355

That means you ought to spend plenty of time - learning of an alien skill is a very slow process, and that's why it is so boring.\nIt is very good idea to start exploring new fields, but you shouldn't expect a success which could be compared with your primary skills. So, I think the good idea is to find and hire someone pro and learn from him. You will save the time and money.",1253396305

(EDIT: Dennis Baron, the author of the book discussed in the article, teaches at Urbana-Champaign).<p>I think you might be onto something with the way 2001 depicts communication.  I think the film is so ingenious in its presentation of ""future technologies"" in a mundane context.  The movie has aged so well; I think that's a pretty accurate representation of some video chatting I've done, even though it took more than 40 years to materialize.<p>It's pretty hyperbolic to call 2001 a dystopia, especially if they're referring to the apparent lack of enthusiasm that accompanied communication.<p>Yes, HAL went on a murdering spree, but if that's all the Rossmeier (the article's author) is talking about, then he's missing the point of 2001.<p>Anyway, I agree: it's an odd reference.  I think 2001 is one of the best movies I've seen (no joke), so I have a few thoughts on the matter...",1253395961

I think it is wonderful if someone can stand by their choices simply because they figured that was the best they could have done with the information at the time.<p>Hindsight is 20/20, easy to say now 'you should have stayed on', when in fact it could have gone the other way as well and he'd have been on the hook.",1253395388

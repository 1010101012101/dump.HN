1372761,comment,1372275,1372275,0,0,rue,,,"I disagree that it is just about ""trust"", as someone above asserts, although that is a big part of it. Many people indeed are upset mainly about the violation of trust rather than the underlying privacy issues. (The intrusions are not advertised, explained clearly, and the amount of interconnectedness is quite beyond most people's understanding.)<p>However, one component of all this I find distasteful is the more or less explicit coercion into revealing private information to use a service which, in some cases, is perceivedly or <i>de facto</i> necessary for one's livelyhood, social life or whatever. In particular because the offline equivalents or predecessors never needed such. You can argue that a teen does not <i>need</i> to use a virtual (no pun intended) monopoly like Facebook, or that no-one really <i>needs</i> to use unencrypted e-mail but that is just not realistic.<p>The (soon-to-be) ubiquity of the WWW or internet in general means that it cannot for long be allowed to go so radically against people's privacy expectations (some countries already offer better protection than others). The solutions may well be created by the private sector - say, making HTTPS and encryption for e-mail or equivalent the defaults.<p><i>Disclaimer: For this and other reasons I have avoided Facebook, MySpace et al., do not exclusively use Google's services, handle my own e-mail and so on. I am under no illusion that I am particularly secured against a concentrated effort, but I am satisfied I have limited my exposure somewhat.</i>",1274641090

There are a bunch of decently supportable practical and principled reasons for this.<p>Since there are going to be leaks anyway, reducing the expectation of privacy is in their interest.<p>Getting more data searchable and public means people are more likely to consume more facebook time/data (alluded to above).<p>In the medium term, privacy for things people put on the internet is dead, and spending a lot of effort fighting a rearguard action seems pointless if you've already accepted where this is going.  I think this is actually where most of this is coming from: Zuckerberg, Schmidt, and others <i>have</i> spent a lot of time thinking about privacy and the implications of a basically open internet (largely unused SSL, DNSSec, public key crypto), and they understand that the battle for keeping things private was lost more than ten years ago.

1372730,comment,1372579,1372675,0,0,jimmyjim,,,"[Interviewer]: So, Google claims to offer more freedom than apple<p>[Stallman]: It's hard not to respect freedom a little more than Apple does, since Apple is about as nasty as exists in world today. Google does some things that are good and some things that are bad. I think it's usually best to look at the various things a company does and judge each of them separately. That way we put more pressure on a copmany to change the things that are bad. Now Google develops a lot of free software and funds substantial amount of free software developers, that's good. Then, look at the Google services. Some of them work okay with free software, and there's nothing particularly bad about them. Nearly all of them, maybe all of them, try to install a piece of non-free javascript program to the user's browser. But many of the services will work okay even if you block the JavaScript. Some javascript code does things that are so simple that we can think of it just slightly extended markup for the HTML, but that's not always true -- some  JavaScript is quite complicated, and it's not acceptable for that to be non-free. So, somebody's working on a program, which I think will probably be an added feature on NoScript that will make it possible to block all non-free non-trivial JavaScript. I think for instance that Google Docs won't work if you don't allow a half a meg of a JavaScript program to be installed.",1274639924

I realized I cant play video games, golf, read  for long hours on a regular basis even though I love doing these things. So why should programming be any different. I will only code when I feel like it. I think its less productive then the traditional style but the code feels better.",1274638502

I live in Michigan, so I can guarantee that pretty much every child coming out of Detroit has been tested in a standardized manner by the state at least three times while in school (conservatively, I remember having more but I'm not sure what all they were), and they still come out with problems. You can't even get a real HS diploma without passing these tests.

1372676,comment,1372275,1372275,0,0,jdietrich,,,"We all have a vague, intuitive sense of what the appropriate degree of publicness and privateness is in a given situation. Although vague, our sense of privateness is incredibly fine-grained and what is perfectly normal in one context can be a massive violation in another, almost identical context. While some of us geeks might think of ""public"" and ""private"" in a binary, cryptographic sort of way, most people have a much more nuanced approach.<p>Consider for example the difference in privateness between two people sitting on a quiet park bench and two people sitting on a bus seat. They are both obviously public places, but there is a subtle but significant difference in our expectations of privacy. In one context, eavesdropping is perfectly normal (within certain bounds), in another it is quite sinister.<p>On the internet, these intuitions are frequently confounded. Someone who assumed that their facebook feed was fairly private discovers youropenbook. User 927 assumed that his search terms were just noise in the crowd until AOL published them all. Countless iPhone users didn't know that their photos contained their exact geographic location until 4chan had a go at ruining their life.<p>The problem isn't the level of privateness or publicness of a particular service, it's not even particularly about leaks or breaches; it's about people being completely unable to judge the level of privateness of anything digital. I expect most people simply would not use a 100% public medium for their private communications, so the ""if it's on the internet, it's public"" mantra isn't a great deal of use. I think this is one of the reasons why Twitter has been so successful - it provides a platform that implicitly communicates its privacy or lack thereof. Twitter's simplicity makes it easy to understand and integrate into your existing model of social appropriateness.<p>I think we come back to a very old and very simple principle of interface design - don't surprise the user. We should be trying wherever possible to design systems that are as private in practice as they would seem to be intuitively. Users don't read much of anything, so we need to think about other ways of communicating ""publicness"" and ""privateness"" in our software. We need to recognise that designing social spaces is not a primarily technical problem. Small differences in architecture, interface and even general ambience can create enormous differences in how a platform is used. This stuff is really hard and really easy to completely cock up and I think we need to think much harder about it. Nod to PG here - HN is IMO a great example of a subtly, intelligently designed social platform.",1274638053

1372673,comment,1372387,1372596,0,0,jerf,,,"The economy is really pressuring the unions. As it becomes clear that public pensions are right up there with the unfunded Social Security and Medicare mandates in terms of ""things that will destroy our economy in the next couple of decades"", the unions that have obtained their public pensions are having to spend more and more of their political capital just on maintaining their economy-destroying gains. The teacher's unions are one such union. (Not the biggest, but definitely a player.) Teacher's unions have a lot less political capital left over to defend themselves against reforms that may weaken (or eliminate) tenure or create the sort of individual accountability they've been fighting for a while.<p>I think their ability to resist this is tied to whether the economy gets substantially better in the next two years; if so the pension problem may fall out of focus (even though it will actually only be getting worse, but such are the vicissitudes of democracy), if it doesn't, I suspect the teacher's unions will end up spending themselves politically bankrupt at which point who knows what will happen? There's a lot of ""reformedness"" that's built up over the years, everyone's going to want to take a crack at it.<p>There is a potential here that there hasn't been for a while.<p>FWIW, I mean most of the above as descriptively as possible, without endorsement of the desirability or lack thereof of anything mentioned. Personally I would like to see substantial ""reform"", but only certain ones, not others. (For instance, I would oppose increasing hours spent in school; I think they are already far more than are necessary to meet current goals and to the extent goals are not being met it is not for lack of hours. So simply slapping an initiative to increase school hours with the label ""reform"" does not make me approve of it.) I perceive no guarantee that even if reform happens, I will like it.",1274637715

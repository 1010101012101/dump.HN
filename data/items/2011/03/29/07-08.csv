The only thing that would make me switch is if they came out with a Linux ARM client. It's the only hardware I have that doesn't have a native client and as more and more ARM devices are coming to market, more people will be wanting that. \nAs a Linux developer, it does feel as if Linux is a third world citizen and the company I work for has offered to do the work for them in porting it to ARM but with no response. If Amazon were to make the ARM client they would definitely see uptake in clients on the devices.",1301385586

In the more than 20 years since it was founded - and now - daily life just could not be managed without it. Sure, it started innocently enough. Connect with your friends, post your pics, keep up with the fam. Yeah, that was then.<p>It wasn't too long before they started adding features. Adding value they called it. Extending your circle. Enabling you they'd say. Yeah, in the same way a spiders web is beautiful. The pattern and symmetry, glistening like shiny gossamer art. Its beauty pulls you in - you don't realize at first as you touch it, that it sticks. No, more than sticks - you become <i>imbued</i> with it. The more you move it wraps around you, encasing you... entombing you. For the data-mining black widow to come and suck the marketable value right out of you, your connections... every aspect of your life is now a product.<p>Classified, organized, tagged, sorted, tracked, pegged, followed, poked, monetized, labeled... owned is what you are. A commodity. A small spec among 3.5 billion in the user base of the book.<p>That's what it was these days... just simply 'the book'.<p>Everyone knows - everyone is aware. They are all in the book. Not even a page, or a word either... more like a letter. A single letter. An iconographic digital hologram of the total sum of your parts - all wrapped up real nice in a uniform singular profitable little package called your <i>user profile</i>. Displayed and viewed and consumed and tracked billions of times over. With more than thirty trillion page views per month, the cancerous blue and white digital encapsulation of the human soul was now blazoned across innumerable screens as nearly half the worlds population interacted on the book - more than 20% of the worlds population on the book at <i>any given moment</i>.<p>A study, one of the countless to be sure, said that now more than 90% of real human interactions occurred through the book. What does that even mean anymore... real? Real human interactions? Through the book? how is that even possible.<p>It was no wonder that in the last few years the backlash has switched to resisting this unexpected strangle-hold on the human condition. Most never saw it coming... happily going along with every new feature update, privacy change, ""enhancement"". MZ was repeating himself a lot these days... except his frame of reference had gotten bigger. Where years ago the book was likened to that which only came along to change humans interactions every 100 years... now his statements were 10 fold. MZ thinks of himself as the embodiment of the singularity... whatever that means. Some fucking fantasy of a long dead cybervisionary that couldn't recognize the makings of our current prison I'm sure. Fuck him.<p>Looking around looks a lot more like binary slavery than any form of singularity. None of our old problems have been solved - in fact the book has only made things worse. After it became a ""platform for governance and outreach"" we, people like - those who <i>really</i> see, knew. We knew what this meant. Game fucking over.<p>This era of hyper connectivity and ultra social awareness was supposed to usher in some sort of Utopian orgasm -- one in which MZ would be carried on the shoulders of the masses to stand next to fantastical human saviors like Jesus. Fictional allusions to stellar bodies be damned!<p>The only problem is that most of the world is too busy. Feeding their attention into the black hole of the book to notice... or care I guess.<p>With ubiquitous access thanks to the assimilation of the largest global fiber network a few years ago, the book was now able to offer complete and total ""free"" access via the acquired goog-net.<p>Years ago, when Athena rolled out - it was a huge success. Welcomed into every neighborhood - direct, very high speed fiber access in every home was quickly made into a ""right"". The model was seen as our manifest destiny, held in a 62-micron translucent hair that fed us with more 1' and 0's to each person in a single day than the entire digital output of the globe in 1999.<p>Such an umbilical cannot be bad right!<p>The only problem is we misjudged the direction of the flow!<p>Now, with goog-net reaching everywhere, but the book being the only lens into the tubes -- our minds are warped. We are a most technically advanced - yet wholly dependant child-like civilization.<p>A mutant.<p>If its not on the platform. Not ""in the book"" they say -- how can it be trusted - how could it succeed? How can you expect to be relevant?<p>HOW CAN IT NOT BE RELEVANT!<p>Slaves! All of them!<p>This is why we act! This is what is needed. Who are we? Who the fuck were we? Not this! Surely not this. It is time....<p>We take action now. Rewrite this so called book.<p>We will not forgive.

Otherwise your statements about performance are doubtful at best.<p>Second of all, those symbols will have an effect on compile times, but they should certainly be stripped out by the linker. Why would symbols that do nothing sit in the executable?<p>Thirdly, Boost's purpose is to iterate faster than the C++ standard library and have real-world data about what libraries work and are needed. Those libraries would then be included in next C++ standards, as it has happened with TR1.\nThere are useful libraries inside Boost and there are research libraries or concept libraries. Don't use a library just because it's included in Boost!<p>I use Boost and Qt. Since TR1 I didn't need Boost as much, which means that it's achieved one of its goals.",1301383245

2381737,comment,2381538,2381538,2,0,jackkinsella,,,"Last year I managed to sell quite a few legal ebooks for students at $160 a piece. It could be worth your while experimenting with a high price point initially since you can always lower it at a later date, or even simultaneously sell at multiple prices.<p>It's possible to have multiple price points for essentially the same item. In another project (learn Spanish, photography and journalism in Bolivia -www.bolivianexpress.org) I differentiated between a ""basic"" package and a more expensive ""complete"" package. This allowed us to charge a higher price to customers with cash yet still remain affordable to those without much money. A commonly cited example of this technique is coffee shops. Coffee is a commodity yet many people will buy their daily fix for $6 (a triple chai vanilla latte cappuccino on wheels) whilst others will buy for only $2 (americano). Both are getting essentially the same product.<p>On the printed vs ebook pricing I choose to sell ebook only for business efficiency reasons. On my website I emphasized the advantages of the electronic format to my customers: instantly available, easily backed up, available to be read anywhere.<p>I'm sure you already plan on doing this, but make sure you take out a Google Adwords campaign targeting your niche.",1301383194

For them, competing with Dropbox would be like shooting themselves in the foot. As long as Dropbox remains on S3, Amazon makes more money the more successful Dropbox gets. If they start to compete directly Dropbox will surely move to a cheaper solution and Amazon will loose a pretty large contract. They would also loose some trust with developers who feel Amazon might smash them at any moment. If Dropbox ever moved as they probably will, I think Amazon may consider competing, but even then don't seem to be in the business of creating client software (exception kindle).",1301382782

The question was about cigarettes, and cigarettes do bend / deform.  That means that any analysis will need to take this characteristic into account.  The problem is, we don't necessarily know all of the factors that need to be modelled to do a correct analysis, which is why empirical testing is still an important technique for problem solving.",1301382473

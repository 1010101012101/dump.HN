I agree re: Silicon Valley, everything from coding resources to VC is restricted here, and the fact that there seem to be only a few of us registered on news.YC is in itself indicative of the different environemnt here. Vinny Lingham and Eric Edelstein seem keen to start some sort of Angel Investing scheme, but I can't see anything ever really equating to the environment in California. As PG says ""places that aren't startup hubs are toxic to startups. You can tell that from indirect evidence. You can tell how hard it must be to start a startup in Houston or Chicago or Miami from the microscopically small number, per capita, that succeed there."" I'm going to apply to YC for Jan 2009, will hopefully have some cool stuff under the belt by then!",1190293198

So one way is to invest in shares of a piece of information and get returns to fluctuate based on the demand for that piece of information. But that would die given enough users, so implemented something simpler, but similar.",1190292981

You already have the answer (but may not realize it.)<p>I clicked on your name and read all of you comments here.  Looks like you've been involved in some pretty healthy debate (pun intended) about diet, lifestyle, etc.<p>The debate IS the answer.<p>We don't need more science, more medical research, and we certainly don't need you going to medical school.<p>WE DO NOT NEED MORE COMPLICATED SOLUTIONS TO SIMPLE PROBLEMS.<p>We already know the answers to the most important questions regarding health.  You have even expressed some of those answers in this forum.  The problem is that half the people don't believe these answers and the other half doesn't do anything with them.<p>The answer to your original question is communication, education, and changes to major institutions.  Many people smarter than you and me have already tried and failed.  The obstacles are many: opponents with vested financial interests, institutions built upon premises that destroy others' health, and downright personal laziness.<p>You are the second multi-millionaire that I have encountered in the last 2 weeks on this exact same issue.  The other was a personal contact who made his fortune through the ""health care machine"" and helplessly watched his father die an anagonizing death from a lifestyle disease.  Now he wants to start something related to the singularity.<p>I am 52 years old, in perfect health, eat cleanly and exercise every day of my life.  It tears me up watching everyone else in my life suffer from declining health.  But they never listen to me; they think I'm ""lucky"".  You and I know better.<p>I am currently working on my 3rd start-up, using web-based technologies to solve many of the problems I haven't been able to solve before regarding helping small businesses harness technology for competitive advantage.  And I, too, wonder, ""Is this all there is?""  Not sure, but for now, I'm giving it all I've got.<p>If you have any ideas about proceeding with something bigger and more beneficial for humankind, I'm all ears.  And full of passion and energy on the subject.  Contact me off-line.<p>   ",1190292894

This guy wouldn't trade some extra time with his family for all the startups and VC cash in the world.</i><p>Saving time is to me the most important point of doing a startup.  You compress the tedious business of making a living into the smallest number of years, instead of letting it drag on through your whole life.<p>Startups often do dramatically novel things, because that is the way to create a lot of wealth fast.  But that benefit is extra.  ",1190291957

57360,comment,47746,47762,0,0,yubrew,,,"Credibility is a large hurdle you will need to overcome.  No one will want to talk to you unless you have some big names backing up your research, and patents showing that you control the IP.  In the science world, so much data is produced that the signal to noise ratio is high, and recognized scientists are extremely valuable.  In other words, you will need to collaborate with academia, and it's probably better now than later.  I suggest pitching your idea to senior faculty in different universities, especially ones focused in doing HIV stem cell research.  Or perhaps working at someone's lab and setting up a collaboration with them.  From what I understand, grant committees look at the name first, and then project second.<p>Salaries alone are nothing in the sciences, but it is expensive to set up your own lab, and could take years before you have validated that your thing actually works.  For developing diagnostics, I bet there is someone trying to make a drug or therapy from CCR5.  Collaborate with them and make the diagnostic part.<p>I know that at Johns Hopkins, anything you develop as an undergrad is 100% owned by you.  Check the IP rights of other schools by talking to their tech transfer offices, and maybe consider transferring to another school.<p>Get someone reputable behind you, and then you guys can actually start doing something.

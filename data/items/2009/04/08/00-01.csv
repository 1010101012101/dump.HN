552064,comment,550583,552036,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Dude, I was a history student. :) (I taught myself to program with library books and a C-64, starting when I was five or so.)<p>Just, it boggles my mind how many ideas from barely ten years ago seem completely unfamiliar to most programmers. As Steve Yegge put it, ""Oh, right, I keep forgetting: you were born in nineteen-ninety something, and you're nineteen, and I'm ninety-something.""<p>I'm only 27, but I'm starting to feel like I'm at least one programmer-generation back (and, occasionally, the cranky old man yelling, ""get off my lawn!""). I find a lot of inspiration in the 70s-80s Unix-era books, for example. While some of the surface details have changed, those guys wrote lucidly about ways to design useful systems without them growing into impossibly tangled monstrosities (even before C++...). A lot of issues programmers struggle with today have been mulled over for <i>decades</i>, and there's a lot of good advice if you look. The field hasn't changed <i>that</i> much.<p>I see ideas that keep getting rediscovered, and sometimes it's really sad how few stick. Lisp had a lot of great ideas in it, yes, but it's not the only old language that did, and the way it gets exalted that way touches a nerve of mine sometimes. (FWIW, the second paragraph in my response above was saved right as the edit window closed. I was still rewriting it, and it sounds harsher than I would have kept.)",1239152328

Currently the one I am working on just launched a successful pilot last Friday and hope to expand organically.<p>I think the YC application really made me think of making the leap in earnest.  While acceptance is always more desirable than rejection I think being rejected by YC has still been a very good thing.  As others have said if you're willing throw your idea(s) away because YC said ""not this time"" you probably don't have what it takes or your idea just isn't what they're looking for.  It doesn't mean you should just abandon or that you can never have a good idea again.<p>That said I certainly would have loved to have the experience and to meet Paul.

When you heat up air, its relative humidity goes down. So especially in winter, the ventilation system can blow very dry air into the building. There are simple technical solutions that artificially ""humidify"" the air, but it's definitely something to look out for. Low humidity can cause all sorts of health problems.",1239151875
552057,comment,551532,551532,0,0,Tiktaalik,,,"I'd certainly pay for an iTuneslike service for impulse buying old magazines in a digital format. I love magazines but they're rarely justifiably keepable as they accumulate and create a terrible clutter. Unfortunately for the majority of us that throw out magazines after a short time, eventually old magazines become incredibly interesting. If I come across ancient Wired, Next Generation or Nintendo Power magazines at a flea market for example, I almost always buy them, not really to keep, as I usually donate them after reading, but just to really page through and revel in the nostalgia.<p>I'd love to be able to go on the web and instantly download some obscure issue of the magazines I liked when I was a teenager, or looking back farther, old ancient National Geographics or Esquires or Playboys or whatever. There are rare magazines as well, such as the Beastie Boys' self published Grand Royal, that only had a handful of issues.",1239151821

You will almost certainly need to organize your schema differently, but you can delegate a lot of that checking onto the database engine, and it will probably speed everything up -- you'll be passing quite a bit less data back and forth just to verify it, and  databases are generally optimized heavily for that sort of checking.

I spent a couple days in Dubai on my way back from visiting family in Jordan, and it felt like a whole different world; supposedly it's all ""Arabs"" but culturally everything was vastly different. That's been my experience interacting with Arabs from other Gulf states as well (Yemenis are crazy...). I suppose it has something to do with the fact that these countries have crap tons of oil money so their citizens don't have to pay for anything (Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, etc are not oil states).<p>It's not totally fair to call the ""Arabs"" the top of the pile. It's more like whoever is a citizen of that state: be it Emiratis or Quataris or whatever. There's a definite hierarchy of ""Arabs"" depending on what country one's from, and in my experience it's not so much who's higher up, it's who's farther from the bottom and thus more difficult to fire.<p>I'm not going to argue that it's not a shitty situation for the servants. I know that there is some hired help that is treated fairly, paid what was agreed, and is free to leave if they so desire, but I can't speculate on what proportion that is, and further my experience is primarily in Jordan. In my short time in Dubai, it was pretty obvious that the opulence of the town could only exist by taking advantage of its poor. I guess if you live there the only way to live with yourself would be to ignore that, as this article shows so many do.<p>About your last comment, I don't think I'd be that harsh about the middle east. It's not all bad, really.

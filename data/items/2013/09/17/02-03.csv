It clearly did not pan out to be the best long-term strategy, but when you already have thousands of paying customers, it gets pretty difficult to &quot;open up&quot; to the general public vs. a company like SO which started open and monetized in other ways (Careers).",1379386779

If the city contracts out to a private monopoly, it is doing nothing more than creating a giant corporate subsidy.&quot;<p>You also mention that the fees are very large, especially for those who are not particularly well off.  I think that&#x27;s VERY to the point.<p>I also think that this penalty will hit the poor much harder than the rich.  If you get a speeding ticket or other similar law infraction, the penalty you get is set by law.  If you get towed, the penalty is set by the tow company and may end up being more than the cost of the car.<p>If you don&#x27;t get it out of impound, and they auction it off and the value they get is less than the fees they have charged you, then they will attempt to extract the extra fees from you as well.<p>If you don&#x27;t have 520 dollars on the first day it&#x27;s towed, and you net less than 56 dollars / day (part time worker? High living expenses?) then every day goes by you&#x27;re losing money and your car.<p>With most law violations, penalties can be appealed to a judge.  In this case, they cannot - it&#x27;s a private debt to a private agency.  It&#x27;s treated as though you asked for this &#x27;service&#x27; and they delivered so you&#x27;re required to pay them for it, even though this is patently ridiculous.<p>The end result is that someone who is poor or down on their luck or otherwise unable to scrape together several hundred dollars is penalized much more than a wealthy individual who can pay the fees immediately.  This is a fundamental inequality in the way the law is enforced.<p>You admit you broke the law and that you were punished.  Most other posters seem to think that&#x27;s the main point.  I think your main point is that the punishment should fit the crime.  Running a red light or speeding by 20 mph may cause people to die, and both crimes carry a few hundred dollar fine.  Your crime causes no chance of physical bodily harm to anyone, and carries a greater penalty, including potentially the immediate forfeiture of ones vehicle depending on whether one is wealthy enough.<p>*edited to include comparisons to other vehicle-based crimes.",1379385989

You miss read.<p>>Well, now it isn&#x27;t clear what you mean at all, because you&#x27;ve said you advocate Weight Watchers while also advocating a simple belief that &quot;it&#x27;s physically impossible for a body to gain weight if it&#x27;s burning more calories than it&#x27;s using&quot;. The people at Weight Watchers are very clear that &quot;we know that a calorie isn’t just a calorie&quot;: they advocate modifications in the kinds of things that you eat and the way you live your life that will lead to a healthier body and, as a side effect, weight loss; in the process, they have a fairly complex equation that assigns &quot;points&quot; to different food items based on a bunch of different quantifiable metrics.

I&#x27;ve also seen a guy eat nothing other than chips and beer, but not go over his points.<p>They all lost weight, because they ate less calories than they used, which the WW points system is all about.<p>As I said, I&#x27;ve seen hundreds of people lose staggering amounts of weight, and I&#x27;ve never seen a single person that didn&#x27;t lose weight when they ate less calories than they used.

For example, the whole grid thing might have to go, instead making tables first class objects in the language, and then have a strong visual representation with an accelerated (not plain text) interface for manipulating them.<p>But maybe you want to take it in a different direction than I do?

For this reason, a number of projects have risen to replace X11.<p>&#x27;Wayland&#x27; is the best supported of these projects, whilst &#x27;Mir&#x27; is similar but has much less support. Mir was started specifically for Ubuntu, and has caused significant controversy in the community.<p>Until these new projects are completed, and in order to support legacy software written for X, bridges that allow X11 compatible software to run on Wayland or Mir have been created. These are called XWayland and XMir respectively.<p>== Current Story ==<p>The open source Intel drivers support X11, and increasingly will support Wayland (not sure on current state of this).<p>Canonical wrote a patchset that adds support for Mir to the Intel drivers, and requested that this be included in the main Intel project.<p>Intel has, for seemingly political reasons, denied that request. Canonical will thus have to maintain the patches themselves (it is common for many distributions to maintain patchsets in this way). If anyone else wanted to use Mir, and use Canonical&#x27;s XMir bridge, they would need to source it from Canonical directly rather than from the main Intel repository.<p>It seems that Intel doesn&#x27;t want to support multiple new windowing projects, and has backed Wayland over Mir (as have many others in the community).",1379384240

In the context in question, they have 64-bit pointers, and they are using unsigned 64-bit values (which conveniently have defined overflow semantics) for the lengths of the input buffer.<p>Even if the calculation for data_end overflows, that would mean one of two things: the caller improperly specified the buffer, or the memory model really does have a buffer whose addressing overflows. In the latter case, because they use an equality test and they have no check for magical address values (like say, NULL) of currbyte, I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;d be a bug in the implementation.<p>> - bugs when using particular functions of the API, such as base64_encode_update()<p>You mean bugs when using specific parts of the API in ways that are not consistent with their specification. It&#x27;s hard to see why you&#x27;d even consider that a bug in the implementation. That&#x27;s a bug in the caller.<p>> The latter problem means that there is no proof that b64enc.c is correct at all, even for a fixed size: it&#x27;s entirely possible that multiple calls to base64_encode_update() would corrupt the internal state.<p>Are you sure about that? First, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be much that would qualify as &quot;internal state&quot; to base64_encode_update(). The closest thing to internal state it has is base64_encodestate, which really only captures which of three states the state machine is in and a result code, both of which are provably in the correct state at the end of each invocation of the function.<p>I&#x27;m not clear as to why you think the proof doesn&#x27;t cover base64_encode_update() being invoked multiple times. It&#x27;s hard to know without understanding what their simulator does, but it sure looks and sounds like it is expanding the full set of possible execution paths through the b64enc, which would include up to N invocations of base64_encode_update(). The only way I can imagine it wouldn&#x27;t be proving correctness for multiple base64_encode_update() calls is if the simulator always had fread() return ball all requested bytes AND you never proved it for cases where N > BUFSIZE (which would just be silly).",1379383473

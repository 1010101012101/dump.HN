If you can invest a few hundred for a computer and have an internet connection (not entirely necessary), you're on board.<p>* Being so new, Computer Science and Software Engineering have nowhere near the academic clout of these other disciplines for which curricula have been refined for quite some time. Think of it this way: How much woud you have valued a doctor's certification in 1650, or even 1850, compared to today? I don't think that very many people really <i>trust</i> a CS degree in the same way that they do a law or medical one.<p>* There's a lot to learn, but you can begin to be productive wth very little knowledge of programming. The nature of programming lends the discipline to a master-apprentice style of training over the highly theoretical.",1222296802

Please. There's no need to insult your readers.<p>And also: <i>""Unlike my friends at the Free Software Foundation, I believe in choice. At the end of the day though, Iâ€™ll keep my iPhone.""</i> Is that sarcasm? I found it hard to tell, but I hope it is. Because if anything, 'choice' doesn't come into play anywhere in the iPhone... And his mistrust of Google is completely irrational (well, given his trust of Apple or whatever other smartphone company; personally, I think I would avoid putting all my assets into one company anyway.)<p>So yeah. Either I failed to understand this article and it was supposed to be funny or a parody, or this is just slightly pointless and aggresive...

Django is really a nice framework, but when you start googling specific issues, e.g. working with an ajax lib or finding/deploying to a VPS/ shared host, ther'es a lot more blog entries on specific issues/techniques that people have used in PHP than in Django.

314177,comment,314118,314118,0,0,cperciva,,,"This sounds like a nice solution -- wave a magic wand called ""changing the accounting rules"", and suddenly everybody will have lots of assets against which to borrow money.  Too bad it wouldn't work.<p>This is exactly what Japan tried: Banks held loans which everybody knew were never going to be paid back, and pretended that they were still worth something.  Instead of having a wave of bankruptcies, Japan had a decade where banks weren't willing to loan money to each other because they knew that they couldn't trust each other's balance sheets.<p>Now, if Sarbanes-Oxley and mark-to-market had never been put into place, it's entirely possible that this financial crisis would have been avoided -- nobody would have ever realized just how bad the situation was.  But now that everybody knows that the situation is bad, allowing companies to overvalue their assets won't do anything to help; and might even make the situation worse, since allowing insolvent banks to fudge their accounting would make it impossible to identify the banks which <i>aren't</i> insolvent.",1222295410

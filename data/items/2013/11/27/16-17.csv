So let me explain why this is a good idea from a rich man&#x27;s perspective.<p>You give poor people a basic sum of money so they don&#x27;t climb over the fence and kill you in your sleep.<p>That&#x27;s it.<p>Behind all the nice language this is what it boils down to. It is paying off poor people to stop pestering you. Chump change for security. Europe learned it the hard way through numerous revolutions and war - keep the lower classes happy and <i>everyone</i> benefits. Social housing, healthcare, the lower rungs of Maslow&#x27;s pyramid.<p>The Romans called it panem et circenses. Not a new idea. Focus on the panem. Hungry people do desperate things.<p>Want to see how society looks like that does not get that? Brazil. Mexico. Have a nice house in Sao Paulo or Mexico City? Then enjoy your 3m high wall with barbed wire around it.<p>Sharing a bit of wealth means personal security for you. You don&#x27;t get robbed. You don&#x27;t get infected by shit because no one gets shots (yes, you want basic healthcare for all). You have a nice large market to sell shit to, so job security (the basic Henry Ford insight).<p>So there you have it, even if you hate poor people there is good reason to give them some money.",1385571521

This is a solved problem on virtually every other platform with a windowing metaphor in the last 25 years.<p>Apple&#x27;s concepts around window resizing and full screen support make it seem like this is a problem so complicated we could solve P=NP and efficiently fold proteins with less effort.<p>I don&#x27;t want to install addons, I don&#x27;t want to spend several seconds breaking my work flow to resize windows <i>just so</i> or any other madness.

Since<p>a) they&#x27;re so cheap as to be virtually disposable<p>b) they haven&#x27;t made core basic OS functions like moving files, accessing network shares without hanging the machine or Maximizing windows an unpossible task worthy of years of wait just to hope that they haven&#x27;t screwed it up yet again and solved only by me wasting my time dragging things around or installing half a dozen third party kludges to hack the OS into something resembling a usable platform.<p>I&#x27;m not asking for weird edge case user environment things, or highly specialized workflows, or ultra-specialized niche window management or other  things, just for the things to work as the user would expect.<p>I love love love my rMBP hardware-wise, but OS X as a user environment has been broken for a long time and it&#x27;s regressing every release with problems that were solved on multiple platforms a <i>human generation</i> ago.<p><i>sorry venting</i>",1385571482

I&#x27;ve lived for years in multiple countries on multiple continents, so I&#x27;m not just talking out my backside.<p>In the rest of the world, the poor people vote for health care, welfare, and unemployment insurance.  This is because they want that safety for themselves if something goes wrong.  They recognize that these programs are largely <i>insurance</i>.  They pay into them in the expectation that most of the time nothing goes wrong, and they&#x27;re not getting their moneys worth.<p>But when something does go wrong, the insurance is there to help them.  In that situation, they get far more out of it than they put in.<p>Their decision to pay insurance is a rational one, based on cost/benefit analysis.  It&#x27;s the same as your decision to buy life insurance, or fire insurance on your house.  (Car insurance is usually mandated, so I&#x27;ll ignore that...)<p>Sure, there are scammers.  But the scammers of these programs are individuals.  Their impact is limited.  The scams done by corporations, and people with the right connections far outweigh the scams done by Joe Average on welfare.<p>In the US, the poor people vote for no health care, no welfare, and no unemployment benefits.  They also vote for lower taxes on the rich (corporate, inheritance, etc.).  They claim this attitude is because they don&#x27;t want idiots on welfare spending MY money.<p>You might be well intentioned, but the rest of the world thinks your approach is crazy.  Not &quot;Gosh, that&#x27;s crazy!&quot;.  But &quot;We, the jury, find the defendant not guilty by reason of mental defect&quot;.<p>The disparity between rich and poor in the US has grown enormously in the past 20 years.  And it&#x27;s all because the average joe has bought a line of horse twaddle about &quot;independence&quot; and &quot;welfare mom living off of MY money&quot;.<p>The rich people who&#x27;ve sold you that crap are laughing all the way to the bank.

6809168,comment,6807380,6807676,20,0,pcwalton,,,"> I feel like PNaCl is the technically superior approach - define a stable set of LLVM bytecode and build an interface to run it in the browser.<p>I don&#x27;t agree. I think that LLVM bitcode was not really designed for this either [1]. Google has not succeeded in eliminating all of the undefined behavior from LLVM [2]. At least asm.js has a fully <i>defined</i> semantics as specified by ECMA-262. For any hope of interoperability between browsers, that&#x27;s critical. Things like order of iteration of properties were once left undefined by ECMA-262, but pages began to rely on Netscape&#x27;s behavior and other browsers had to reverse engineer what Netscape did. Eventually they were added to the standard. Likewise, without <i>all</i> the undefined behavior removed from PNaCl, anyone who wanted a separate implementation of PNaCl would have to reverse engineer what Chrome did.<p>There is also the issue of compilation speed: asm.js was designed to compile quickly by a backend that doesn&#x27;t do much optimization. LLVM, on the other hand, was optimized for -O2, which compiles much less quickly. PNaCl at -O0 is far worse than either V8 or OdinMonkey. On the Web, compilation speed matters a lot.<p>I think an actually technically superior approach, if backwards compatibility were not a concern, would involve:<p>1. A from-scratch, untyped, <i>non</i>-SSA bytecode, basically an isomorphism to asm.js. All operations would have fully defined semantics. This would yield fast compilation without the JavaScript syntax and would be amenable to multiple backends, like LLVM or V8.<p>2. A mechanism for providing a C binding to WebIDL-based Web APIs. This would eliminate the necessity of Pepper and would mean that any new Web APIs would instantly be available to native code.<p>PNaCl, unfortunately, is neither of these. asm.js isn&#x27;t either, but I think it&#x27;s closer to this ideal than PNaCl is.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2011-October/043719.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2011-October/0437...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/stability-of-the-pnacl-bitcode-abi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/stability-of-the-...</a>",1385570646

6809134,comment,6808012,6808185,111,0,oso2k,,,"I worked IT for JPL&#x27;s Cleanroom Group a few years ago.  Biological contaminants are only one factor.  95-99% of the cleanrooms they have are not much cleaner than something like a typical elementary classroom with a well kept air filtration system (not great).  These are Class 100K rooms [1].  Less than 100K particles of 0.1 um size or bigger per m^3 of air (dust, hair, skin, anything really).  Offenders of contaminating the rooms some brought in unapproved or contaminated materials, like non-cleanroom notepads or gaseous/non-cleanroom markers/pens, cardboard.  The reason why the rooms were not operated cleaner is because of their size.  Some were large like 40m by 40m by 40m (the main Spacecraft Assembly Facility where the Herschel instrument saw final assembly), others housed special capabilities like the 25-foot Space Simulator [2], shakers and bakers (rotation/vibration test pedestals, and space vacuum hot/cold chambers), or isolation pads (pedestals mounted on ultra heavy 40&#x27;x40&#x27;x40&#x27; blocks of concrete to reduce vibration for optics instrument testing).  It was also common practice to certify a room at one level, and operate it like it was the next higher level with minimal cost and maximal benefit.  Things like additional air exchanges, daily or twice daily cleanings (instead of weekly), extra HEPA filters, stricter ESD operations, stricter temperature and humidity control (ESD & Planetary Protection reasons).  This was often more than sufficient to appease the Principal Investigators, Instrument Designers, and Planetary Protection.<p>Many rooms were Class 10K capable.  A few were Class 1K or Class 100 capable.  But those were very small rooms, sometimes even 10&#x27;x10&#x27;x10&#x27; tents setup in a one level less capable room.  Only two rooms operated were even capable of operating at Class 100, IIRC, and only did so when necessary.  There were apart of chip fabrication building.<p>To answer your question, Herschel has its base requirements similar to anything we send off into space, and then it had it optics instruments requirements.  Projects have been ruined when instruments do not work or do not work as well as designed because of dust, ESD, or a hair particle.  It&#x27;s really hard/expensive to wipe your lens with a microfiber cloth in space; JPL once did a study to determine the cost/feasibility.  It dwarfed the original project.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanroom#ISO_14644-1_cleanroom_standards\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanroom#ISO_14644-1_cleanroom...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/97249/jpls-torture-chamber-for-spacecraft/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.universetoday.com/97249/jpls-torture-chamber-for-...</a>",1385570391

An agreement with other people, yes? What do we name that agreement with other people? Can there be further stipulations? A price, if you will, for having the convenience of an agreed-upon currency, of a set of courts to seek redress if that agreed-upon currency isn&#x27;t given to you for the work you&#x27;ve put in? Is it okay with you if that agreement tries to get more wealth into the overall system? How do you know if a solution will succeed at doing that unless you try it?<p>That&#x27;s a lot of questions, and few answers, of course. But I think considering these ideas through this lens may be useful. The concept of “my” money, “my” property, etc, is something we&#x27;ve agreed on. There&#x27;s nothing that says there can&#x27;t be more facets to that agreement. That is what we organize for. And ideas like this, and like welfare, etc, are ideas that are meant to raise well-being. People who do well tend to create, as well. And creation breeds wealth. So while the <i>specific mechanism</i> whereby we encourage this creation and well-being is something that&#x27;s absolutely up for debate, it&#x27;s <i>your</i> money only insofar as you&#x27;re not trading it for a service. In this case, the service is, greater wealth for all.<p>Will it work? I don&#x27;t know for sure. But experimentation seems like a pretty good way forward, rather than simply sitting on our hands in a world where we believe we can increase well-being, out of fear that maybe our money might be misused along the way.

Giving every adult a $34,000 basic income (the amount proposed here) would mean a married couple would be bringing in $68,000 a year doing NOTHING AT ALL productive. There&#x27;s no getting around economics: money is an abstraction of productivity. To the extent you introduce money into the economy that was not created by productivity, you simply reduce its value. So what would happen is that the basic income would become the new zero line. It represents the value of zero productive work.

It was actually two conferences held back-to-back, and I was attending both. At the first one the snacks were fruit smoothies, fruit skewers and the like. At the second it was chocolate bars. So during the second conference I grabbed something, then made a comment about the different food and what that implied about the different audiences, and that led into a conversation with a group of three people, exchange of cards, and some follow-up emails since. So yeah, it helps to have something interesting to say about the food, but it&#x27;s still a convenient way to get talking. And people are at these events to talk to other people, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to get started. Similarly, if someone says &quot;nice crab dip&quot; to you, rather than shutting down the conversation with a &quot;yeah&quot;, it behooves you to open it up some random personal detail (&quot;yeah, I don&#x27;t normally eat crab back in <home town>&quot;, &quot;it reminds of the time I visited <random seaside place>&quot;, etc.)<p>As for &quot;seeming creepy&quot;:<p>Whatever, man. One goes to networking events to talk to people. If you have a problem with people talking to you at a point in time and your social skills are so low you can&#x27;t you make that obvious, don&#x27;t go to these events. The other side of the coin is you don&#x27;t glom onto people when they obviously don&#x27;t want to talk to you. That&#x27;s why chatting in a line is good -- you have a maximum of 5 mins if the conversation goes nowhere.",1385569649

Fractional reserve banking, the mutability of the money supply, interest: all of that will continue to exist regardless of currency.

That event triggered an idea of Vulhunter.<p>Features<p>Vulhunter collects information about different server-side software’s vulnerabilities from websites such as NVD and CVE details. The core purpose of the app is to allow user’s to select softwares or operating system keywords from a set list which then becomes activate for notifications. Vulhunter servers continuously checks the feed content against the user’s selected keywords. If the vulnerability report description has a keyword which is selected by the user. The server will fire a notification to the specific user.\nThe other information I wanted to add was a general information about the system’s security news, blog post aggregation and also reports from NVD feed etc.\nDespite, most of the information provided, Vulhunter doesn’t secure users from any 0 day attack. Also it won’t notify for vulnerabilities which aren’t being reported to our third-party feed sources. However, Vulhunter notifies the information which is available to it which helps user to be cautious.\nThere aren’t much competitor in AppStore which provides similar level of information.

To an extent it will depend on what you set the figure at, but history has shown that most people don&#x27;t like not working, even if they don&#x27;t need to to survive.<p>An example; Ireland has a relatively generous social welfare system; an adult currently gets 188 euro a week plus housing benefit etc, and this lasts indefinitely. During the 90s-00s economic boom, unemployment fell below 4%, which is normally considered functional full employment. Clearly, when jobs were available, people wanted to do them. Now, maybe if you double or triple the figure it&#x27;ll work out differently, but I&#x27;d be surprised if it would be that different.

Now, you have to keep your money in a bank because it appears to be safe, etc. and of course all your arguments about creating liquidity in the economy are correct.<p>However, there is a lack of choice in this scenario. Due to the way the economy functions, I do have to put my money into a bank, I do have to look into investments because otherwise my hard earned money is worth less in the future. Let&#x27;s leave the discussion about that being fair or unfair, etc. because this is a subject where people tend to have strong opinions.<p>Right, so coming to bitcoin. Why can&#x27;t there be an entity that allows you to lend your bitcoin as a loan and you get a higher return (higher % interest than regular deflation) because you lent your money out (i.e. took some risk) ? Say deflation is 5% per year and you can give out a loan through some entity and get 10% returns ?<p>Isn&#x27;t this what the bank does right now for you ? But do you have much of a choice in the current scenario ? Right now, you take on the risk of a bank without having a say in it. It&#x27;s either that, or have your purchasing power slowly eroded over time.<p>I personally don&#x27;t like arguing about inflation vs. deflation because I am not an economist but I can on my own think of trivial solutions that turn the problem around. Maybe these solutions are ultra complex to implement in practice, but so are the economy, currency markets, stock markets, etc.<p>Can I argue that it would be great if I worked hard to earn money and save it, and have it at the very least, retain it&#x27;s value and purchasing power in the future? Why should the capital that I have worked hard to earn lose it&#x27;s value because it somehow doesn&#x27;t help the economy ? Helping the economy comes with it&#x27;s own risks.

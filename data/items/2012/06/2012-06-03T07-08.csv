    Application windows
    Move left a space
    Move right a space
    Switch to desktop N (number of entries up to N appearing  varies with current number N of dynamic Spaces)
</code></pre>
Also:<p><pre><code>    Move focus to active or next window
</code></pre>
By default and depending whether you upgraded to Lion and what your previous settings were the base mod key may be Command, Control or Command+Control. If you installed from scratch it's Control.<p>Then, shortcuts are:<p>- Ctrl+Up/Down to enter MC/App Expos<p>- Ctrl+Left/Right/1/2/3/4 to change Spaces (works on the desktop and in MC)<p>- Command+` (and Tab/Shift+Tab) cycles apps in App Expos.<p>- Arrows allow one to select a window in App Expos<p>On a laptop, the touchpad is right below the keyboard and I usually trigger MC with a 3f swipe, F3 or Control+Down (depends on my zone level) and select the window with index (when swipe-triggered) or thumb (when keyboard triggered). When using a mouse, I'm using a Logitech MediaPlay at home and a Logitech MX900 at work, which have two awesomely placed thumb buttons, which map perfectly to Mission Control and App Expos (the button choices appear in the rightmost combos in System Settings -> Mission Control if you have a sufficiently buttoned mouse). Using another mouse than Magic Mouse I lose the brilliant touch/inertia scroll, but the two-finger double-tab gesture is completely ridiculous and a total pain.<p>Comparatively, Command+Tab is only fine when I'm toggling between two apps which have a single window, else the whole target app windows cover the previous one, which defeats my extensive use of Window Magnet. Also I have 1) a high chance of not landing into the proper window this way, and 2) a high chance of toggling between three apps, in which case Command+Tab is inefficient. Also I find it egregious that one keeps open Command+Tab by keeping Command down, then drill down to App Expos, where you have to release command before moving with arrows and subsequently select a window  with Return when it could be Command all the way then release to exit.<p>Also, when moving between terminal windows and tabs I use the build-in Next Window/Tab shortcut (Command+Left/Right, with Shift for tabs). I bound the same keys in MacVim for consistency.<p>Besides there's still lack a (non third party) keyboard way to:<p>- navigate between window groups/windows in MC<p>- add a new space<p>- move windows between spaces",1338709286

4060305,comment,4058513,4060107,2,0,jasomill,,,"Conversely, it gives two opportunities to <i>avoid</i> not only typos, but ""thinkos"". Simple declarative definitions can often define the results of complicated algorithms. Algebraic topology is actually a nice example. Presumably a surface has no holes if and only if any loop on the surface can be contracted to a point (given appropriate definitions of all these terms, of course). While this equivalence is easy to verify,<p><pre><code>    def has_holes(s):
        for c in all_loops(s):
            try:
                contract(c)
            except:
                return True
        return False
</code></pre>
isn't an effective algorithm (e.g., ""all loops"" is an infinite set). But algebraic topology shows how one might instead reduce the problem to computationally tractable linear algebra. Suppose, then, that you've implemented an (presumably nontrivial and therefore error-prone) algorithm to carry out this reduction. Then your patently correct constraint on all loops might be a useful source of tests.<p>(disclaimer: I know nothing at all about computational algebraic topology, except that it's fascinating. So please take my example with an unbounded grain of salt.)",1338708938

(That YouTube video of the CNC-milled chess pieces is pretty cool too.)<p>For all the geometry advantages of 3D printing, there are also disadvantages.  The materials you can use are limited.  Pieces coming out of the printer require finishing work, especially at the low end.  Mills are more versatile and produce mostly ready-to-use pieces.<p>Both 3D printers and mills are inefficient for making more than one copy of a part.<p><i>2. Tooling cost.</i><p>Tinkercad links to the Makerbot Replicator, it's $1800.  Roland makes hobbyist CNC mills for $900.  I've used a cheap 3D printer before, and it can't produce pieces that are anywhere near the quality you advertise on your site.  They look like a very drunk person vaguely sketched the outline of the piece with a hot glue gun :)<p><i>3. CAD software. ... This is a meta observation that ""I drew in my CAD program"" is often the hardest problem to solve.</i><p>I don't understand why your software can produce 3D printing instructions but not toolpaths for CNC mills.  Once you've made a nice UI layer (which you have) it's just another algorithm on the backend.<p>Anyway, I don't think the 3D printing is going to be a revolution.  People can draw things and make a machine make them already.  The rest is just implementation details.  (2D printing was a revolution.  Cheap inkjets were just a nice implementation.)",1338708250

The capacity between ground and shaver circuit is tiny, so only a really tiny number of electrons travels through you to put the shaver circuit on the same potential as ground.<p>The important thing here is that as soon as you ground the shaver circuit by touching it, there is a (tiny) static discharge, and then there is no force that restores any potential difference between ground and shaver circuit. The only force is the transformer, creating a potential difference between the two ends of the shaver circuit.

4060265,comment,4058818,4058818,6,0,DenisM,,,"In FIDO.net the problems were largely solved, and they remained solved for a long time. It worked like this:<p>1. Each forum has a list of rules. Not reading rules -> penalty. Breaking the rules -> penalty.<p>2. Each forum forum has a FAQ. Asking a question from FAQ -> penalty. Unless you can show you read FAQ and there is still something to be discussed.<p>3. Each forum has regularly updated off-topic list. Bringing up a topic from this list -> penalty. Moderator keeps the offtopics up to date, adding/removing things as needed to maintain calm.<p>4. Arguing with moderator or comoderators in public -> penalty. All arguments should go into private messages.<p>5. Telling others what they can and cannot say (usurping moderator's power) -> penalty. All complains should go into private mail.<p>6. Moderator is usually elected (if public forum) or self-appointed (if he owns the forum). The former can be impeached. The latter can be ignored by creating an alternative forum.<p>7. Moderator appoints co-moderators. If comoderators misbehave, moderator alone can overrule.<p>8. Penalties accumulate, yielding bannination.<p>The system worked well because bannination was real - most people on FIDO had real identities. No reason one can't do the same with facebook logins now.",1338707187

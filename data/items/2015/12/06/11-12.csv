But 40% is outside the US, and compare it say to Walmart which employs literally a couple million, and you&#x27;ll find tech companies in general don&#x27;t make large dents in employment figures.<p>As for actual services, there&#x27;s barely any difference. A European benefits virtually the same from Google&#x27;s products and services, albeit sometimes say the launch of the latest Nexus happens two weeks later in small European countries like the Netherlands.<p>Mostly I&#x27;d say the benefits are related to generating and disseminating your own culture, more political/legal influence in worldwide companies, drawing talent to your country etc. These benefits are significant, but I don&#x27;t think Europe has anything to be alarmed about. Tech here is great, lots of solid companies with billion dollar valuations, solid infrastructure, but fewer unicorns. And that&#x27;s no surprise with the EU being, deep down, a fragmented market where the biggest first-language market is German which stands at 18% of the EU population. It&#x27;s not easy to roll out companies that grow to hundreds of millions of people in Europe, if the biggest language that people speak as a first language is only spoken by 18% of the union. European talent with great ideas that aim very large tend to go English first, and then move to the US at the earliest signs of solid traction. Everyone else stays, and that&#x27;s how you get lots of solid companies like Supercell with a few billion dollars valuation that are relatively small compared to a Facebook.

For example, a package build machine could track compiled files that have changed since it compiled an older version of the software, and store them at the start of the archive when zipping the installable files into package.

This has in its execution by Google etc. generally become more of an annoyance than a privacy feature).<p>However, I think the decisions the European Court of Justice makes on these issues could be a chance for Europe. The &#x27;right to be forgotten&#x27; and the recent safe harbor decision show--in my opinion--that the ECJ wants to establish a more privacy-focused jurisdiction in Europe. That could be a chance for, say a Google competitor that does not track you through AdWords but, instead, relies on a monthly subscription model (this might not be a very good idea, but you get my point). And when Angela Merkel says that &#x27;too much privacy is bad for business&#x27;, I disagree, because Europe cannot come to the table one decade late and copy what worked in the Bay Area.<p>If Europe establishes a reputation for a different sort of service that relies on strong encryption, user privacy and the absence of ad-support but rather subscription, I think the European startup world could thrive in serving a market that is currently emerging rather than one that has been there for the better part of a decade.",1449400958

10684968,comment,10684730,10684730,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"One can wonder how valuable these companies really are. Yes, they&#x27;re valuable to investors, but the investors of Facebook are not American, they&#x27;re completely international. The return on investment on capital investment flows to investors worldwide, not just US investors because it&#x27;s a US company.<p>So what else then... Taxes, here tech companies are notorious. Stories of FB paying a few thousand in total taxes in the UK, Apple leaving its cash abroad to avoid taxation, Google channeling its revenues through a royalty-scheme between Ireland and the Netherlands that goes virtually untaxed (Dutch Sandwich) etc... tax wise these companies contribute little to the place of their main business (e.g. the US for the above three companies).<p>Then, employment? Here too, tech companies are known for providing relatively little employment compared to the size of the business, versus other industries. To take an extreme example, walmart (a company which pulls the vast majority of its revenues from the US alone) has up til recently had more store locations, than FB has employees. FB doesn&#x27;t even have 12k employees, Walmart has literally a couple million. The article mentions Whatsapp as an example, it just had 55 employees when it was sold for almost $20b Compare that with say Vente Privee, a French online retailer that has 2500 employees and close to $2b in revenue and a slightly higher valuation, that nobody talks about. Which would you rather have in your country, creating jobs? You may still (likely) say Whatsapp, but it wouldn&#x27;t be an obvious answer. Instagram is similar, 18 employees, who cares whether they&#x27;re in the US or not? It&#x27;s a meaningless figure for employment alone. And again, ownership wise the billion dollar valued company is in the hands of international investors, and tax wise it&#x27;s likely little to nothing.<p>So what&#x27;s the contribution of these US companies to the US then? What is Europe really missing? It profits from all the international innovations (I happily use Google&#x27;s services), while it taxes the above companies for doing business in the EU.<p>If tech was shitty in Europe, sure, all of this would be alarming. But we have great research (e.g. hadron collider), IT/ICT infrastructure is very solid, if I look at my own country we have digitised and modernised everything from insurance to banking to tax filings, at the supermarket I pay via NFC, as I do in a bus, metro, train or tram. I don&#x27;t live in some outdated world without technology.<p>There are very obvious counterarguments to make... in particular political and cultural control and influence that large companies like Google have and the power that wields, that Europe thereby doesn&#x27;t have, can be or become an issue. Reinventing our own industries the next few decades without inspiring tech companies, is trickier. Seeing talent trained at great European universities with great startup ideas fly to the US for various reasons, is an issue. I appreciate all of that, and yet I feel the importance of companies like FB&#x27;s contributions to the US as opposed to the rest of the world, is overstated, and that we&#x27;re not missing out all that much by not having a European FB, for example.<p>At the end of the day there are 3 superlarge markets, the US, Europe and China. Then a number of very large ones like India or Japan. But of those first three, the EU is merely a partial economic, political and legal union, with a wide range of languages, laws, cultures and systems. While the US and China certainly have internal diversity, it&#x27;s nothing like the EU. It&#x27;s why we have tons of companies with a few billion dollar valuations, that capture a substantial portion of the EU but far from all of it. The biggest first language market in the EU is German, and it stands at 18% of the EU as a first language, see what I mean? In the US or China, you can pretty much roll out tech products nationally in many cases, not without any friction, but in a way that&#x27;s much more natural than in the EU. That doesn&#x27;t mean tech sucks here, that we have little value, no jobs or shitty digital/online services, it&#x27;s just fine here (find me digital/online services that the US has that we simply don&#x27;t have access to, that&#x27;s missing in EU markets completely), but we have fewer ultralarge unicorns like Google or Facebook, and I&#x27;m not all that convinced that this is as big a problem as it&#x27;s made out to be.",1449400751

Here are my thoughts:<p>* Regulation: With its strict censorship and great firewall, the Chinese government effectively shut out most American IT companies from their market, giving local companies enough time to grow.<p>* Culture: Chinese culture is much more different from American than European culture is, hence it is also much more difficult to adapt an American IT service to the Chinese market than to the European.<p>* Market size: With 1.3 billion people, 900 million of which speak Mandarin the market size for any IT service is enormous, even taking into account that many people still do not have reliable Internet access or a lot of money to buy services / products online. Likewise, the market growth is much higher than in the US or Europe.<p>Personally I believe that the main competition for American IT companies will not come from Europe but from China. Right now, most Chinese IT startups only follow in the roots of their successful American idols, but with so many well-educated young entrepreneurs this should change soon, and I predict that we will see more and more disruptive Internet startups &quot;made in China&quot; very soon.",1449400245

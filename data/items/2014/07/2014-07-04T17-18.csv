In fact Rich Hickey says himself: You can do concurrency in Java with semaphores and such, but you end up doing some sentinel-thing that&#x27;s somewhat specialized for your particular subsystem. Then you have to interface with this other subsystem...implement this new feature...then several months later you have a bug introduced because these weren&#x27;t put together correctly.<p>In a large Clojure project, you should pick a particular way of doing things, then maybe allow a wrinkle or two, then be consistent about it throughout your project, or at least in that subsystem. Maybe you make your entire model an Atom and have a few FIFO queues for information coming in and going out? What you don&#x27;t want to do then is to mix in transactional memory or Agents. Otherwise you can find yourself back in the &quot;polyglot&quot; mode of Java. With Go, you have a few flexible primitives from which to produce concurrent systems, but the same thing goes here too. You need to pick a few patterns and stick with them. Otherwise you can make your life much harder.<p>However, when you start going parallel, whatever you have chosen can go pear-shaped for some hard to fathom reason. Go is no better in this regard.",1404496599

7989617,comment,7988738,7988738,5,0,skybrian,,,"The conclusion I take away from this is that good performance isn&#x27;t necessarily more useful than predictable performance. For many language implementations, the performance characteristics are quite fragile, and you&#x27;d better be benchmarking after every change or you won&#x27;t notice a regression.<p>Even setting up a benchmark is tricky because the same binary can have dramatically different performance depending on the environment. At the machine level, caching effects from different processors can have dramatically different effects on performance. But compilers and runtimes can easily make things even more unpredictable, requiring things like warmup time to even hope to get an idea of what&#x27;s going on.<p>I think Go starts out a bit closer to achieving predictable performance; any ahead-of-time compiler has an advantage here. Other than the use of garbage collection, the whole language seems to be designed with predictable performance in mind over ease of use, and you can avoid GC where it matters. Also, recently they replaced segmented stacks with copying of contiguous stacks, which both improves performance and makes it more predictable (while a goroutine is running).",1404495808

The second would be that giving an &#x27;unknown&#x27; third-party this kind of access to your systems leaves you open to them being exploited and then exploiting you (and this scenario seems much more likely than someone guessing your password if you are using one on SSH for some reason).<p>All in all, deployment seems like something to me which I&#x27;d always want to keep in-house.",1404493328

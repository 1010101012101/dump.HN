I didn't mean the industrial revolution was started by population explosion, only the squalor was (among other factors) caused by it. <p>Sorry I don't have the books with me right now (until next week), and I didn't learn them by heart. I seem to also remember that there were machines before the ""revolution"" - maybe it still was a change of political circumstances that permitted the revolution (free trade between countries, possibility of ownership giving incentives for entrepreneurs etc.). Certainly several factors worked in combination, it's not like the invention of a particular machine triggered it all.<p>I also seem to remember that China has the fewest farmland per person of all countries in the world. I don't think anybody can simply be a farmer. I know I couldn't just be a farmer in my country.",1182171196

28847,comment,28703,28779,0,0,euccastro,,,"Sure, automating the grind is easy; the problem is other humans noticing you're a bot. Turing Test anyone?<p>The surest way to make a game less automatable is to link progress to social factors. It would also make the life of everyone more interesting- including sweatshop workers. If someone is making my game more interesting and meaningful through human interaction, they're legitimately earning their dough in my book.<p>Of course, easier said than designed.",1182170402

It's a waste of time. It just requires way too much work from the regular user to be worthwhile and viable. Only redeeming quality was the endless scroll :).  ",1182170254
28845,comment,28703,28780,0,0,euccastro,,,"[Disclaimer: I work for a MMOG company that is not Blizzard.]<p>I'm with you, and still I can see how it makes business sense for Blizzard to discard your suggestions:<p>- WoW is doing well, gold farming and all. If Blizzard can contain the problem in tolerable levels by playing whack-a-mole with the most ostensible farmers, then it's not a huge deal for them.<p>- Actual plot and compelling narrative aren't what Blizzard brands are made of. The more personality a world has, the harder it gets to keep it appealing for everyone. Stereotypical/generic/mildly cartoonish themes are easier to mass market.<p>- I believe allowing scripting would make any MMO better (long story, and this is not a game design forum; email me if you want to discuss this further), but it would favor programming savvy players, discouraging the vast majority of your audience. This would also make problems like security or game balancing harder to deal with.<p>I believe you could make an interesting MMOG that has mass appeal, but unfortunately it's a harder design and execution problem than if you relax the 'interestingness' constraint.<p>I wouldn't want to come across as cynical, though. I'd rather make something I love even if it makes less money, and I can see how smaller studios can make a niche for themselves, and even get a shot at big time eventually, by committing to outstanding game design.<p>But WoW? They won't mess with their cash cow, and it makes full sense.",1182169413
28844,comment,28610,28781,0,0,corentin,,,"Bloat is different from complete (or ""feature-full""). Bloat means very long installation processes (Microsoft is the champion here), long startup times, slow software, huge memory requirements, crashes, etc.<p>When you install a typical, cheap consumer device under Windows (anything: a printer, a joystick, etc.) from the vendor's CD-ROM it usually installs megabytes of bullshit, including automatically-started craplets with shiny but useless owner-drawn GUIs, etc. This is bloat. When I plug-in some USB stuff in my OpenBSD laptop, the kernel spits a few lines on the console to tell it has recognized the device and that's all.<p>edit: the last releases of Acrobat Reader, huge, very slow and buggy are a very good example of bloat.",1182168859
28843,comment,28703,28842,0,0,lupin_sansei,,,"Exactly. The guy above got it back to front. The population explosion was <i>because</i> of the extra wealth from the industrial revolution lowering the death rate due to the end of famine. <a href=""http://www.mises.org/books/conquest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mises.org/books/conquest.pdf</a><p>Feudalism ended in England in the 16th century, hundreds of years before the industrial revolution <a href=""http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0006447.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0006447.html</a>",1182168380
28842,comment,28703,28821,0,0,pg,,,"Are you implying that the Industrial Revolution was caused by population pressure? That would be an amazing coincidence, wouldn't it, if jobs in factories appeared at just the moment it ""wasn't possible to be a farmer anymore.""<p>In fact the history of every country that industrializes is the same.  People work on farms till jobs appear in factories, and then they move to the cities-- not because it isn't possible to work on farms anymore, but because it's such a grim life.<p>And incidentally, feudalism was over in England centuries before the Industrial Revolution got started in the late 18th century.",1182168042

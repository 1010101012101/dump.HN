8979493,comment,8977229,8977229,0,0,mwhite,,,"This is very interesting.  I&#x27;m currently a little bit of the way through solving some of the problems solved by Relay using an existing open source stack, and I&#x27;m curious if anyone has any thoughts on how it would compare.  I&#x27;ve only skimmed the Relay video, and I haven&#x27;t created a full React app yet, so forgive me if I get something wrong.<p>First, for the framework-level handling of fetching all data before rendering, where the data needed by each component is defined in each component, just copy how it&#x27;s done in react-router&#x27;s async-data example [1], modified to expect a hash of promises as in [2].<p>The promises return Backbone-Relational models [3].  You can model arbitrary relations using Backbone-Relational, although many-to-many is apparently kind of hacky (but just needs work to be seamless).  It supports parsing REST API responses with nested models and collections as related models.  A REST API generator like Flask-Restless [4] creates these responses with a single efficient query.<p>You have the flexibility to either sync all models before rendering, or render any component without all data already being fetched, and have it automatically re-render when loaded.<p>Components subscribe and unsubscribe to model events at the proper points in the component lifecycle using react-backbone-component.[5]  I missed this and wrote my own version [6] before I found it, but mine is cleaner, slightly more featureful, and presents a simpler API.<p>Anyway, this requires some work to pull together, but I think it presents a viable alternative that:<p>- uses existing libraries that do one thing well and allows as much departure from each elements of the architecture as you want<p>- works with react-router, which is the shit<p>- works with your existing REST API<p>Relay looks wonderful, but it&#x27;s possible to build the abstractions that do pretty much the same thing that support existing REST APIs.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/examples/async-data/app.js#L121"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/examples/a...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/rackt/react-router/wiki/Announcements"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rackt/react-router/wiki/Announcements</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://backbonerelational.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backbonerelational.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://flask-restless.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://flask-restless.readthedocs.org/en/latest/</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/magalhas/backbone-react-component"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/magalhas/backbone-react-component</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/mwhite/f763c189f58de7af5d34"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/mwhite/f763c189f58de7af5d34</a>",1422779430

If a trade is to large it ends up being sent to another exchange.  If it&#x27;s large enough it&#x27;s going to move both exchanges.

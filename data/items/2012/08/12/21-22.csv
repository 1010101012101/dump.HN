From the Wikipedia entry:<p><i></i>On May 2 2012 the leadership roles of the project came into question [8]. Prior to May 2 2012 Leighton acted as project lead, and operated the project according to free software principles. After taking control of the pyjs.org domain name and copying the mailing list data without members' permission, a group of developers critical of the leadership methods of Leighton effectively outed him from his role by transferring the project to non-free resources. Talks were held with the Python Software Foundation to have the project transferred to and run by the PSF, but the talks stalled after the PSF learned that, in direct violation of the UK Data Protection Act 1998, the mailing list data had been copied without Leighton's permission or knowledge, and without the consent of or consultation with any of its members. The pyjamas project is the first Free Software Project ever to have been hijacked, rather than forked.<i></i>",1344808721

In the really early stages of a startup, it would seem best err on the side of focusing on maximizing the potential / value of ""what makes you win"" given the danger at that stage tends to be doing too many (unfocused) things. I still think ""slack"" time is important, but only after what ""makes you win"" is running out of juice or you need a different stepping type / level of stepping stone when expanding (say, when you cross $10,000 users and you've run out of friends / acquaintances to sign up).

I recently had a look at Ada and was pleasantly surprised -- it has a very straightforward syntax.<p>As other's mention here, I think C should be learnt with assembler (and computer architecture - especially the bit about cache hits/misses). I find that:<p><pre><code>  http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/\n</code></pre>\nis a great introduction to assembler and C -- and how the two (can) interact.<p>Another thing I find frustrating with C is that it's still a bit of a pain to work with unicode/wide strings -- on my todo list is writing a short post on ""Hell wrld (with unicode)"" -- with some examples of wide strings in C, (possibly Pascal) and ADA -- along with assembler output and a ""pure"" assembler version.<p>There is surprisingly little good material on the web for this (that I managed to find, anyway).",1344807821

I think I have a pretty good plan for learning to program that seems to be working (= just trying to build stuff and going over it with the developers I work with).<p>But I want to learn more about general technology too (e.g. how flash memory works). Even some history would be nice. Almost all of my friends who are non technical (and even some who are) would benefit from broader exposure to technology (I frequently get asked questions like ""What's an API?"").<p>I'm considering diving into this (in addition to programming) and posting what I learn on a blog, but it would need to be organized to be useful. I was thinking to (1) dive into the history of computing a bit (2) understand how hardware + software have evolved (3) learn about today's systems setups (4) learn about where top people think tech is going.<p>If you have any suggestions or advice or parts of tech you've found helpful knowing, any good books / resources or general thoughts, I'd appreciate it.

I wouldn't be ready to move off my familiar Objective-C stack quite yet, but if more projects like this one come along i might just consider it.<p>One thing I'm curious about is the support for TDD when using Rubymotion, there's a lot of Rspec clones out there for Objective-C but they all feel a bit hacky due to the language's less than stellar support for DSLs.

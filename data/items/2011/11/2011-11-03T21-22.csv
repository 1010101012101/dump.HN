3193855,comment,3192589,3192752,1,0,product50,,,"IMHO, this is not a bug but a feature. ""do a barrel roll"" is a trending topic today. So it must have been ranked higher in their search suggestions. The first query which is suggested when you say ""do a"" is ""do a barrel roll"" which causes the whole page to roll.<p>Pretty cool - I think we should be appreciative of such efforts rather than cultivating bugs. A standard experience is what Google had offered for years - can you even begin to imagine, what it would have taken for the Product Manager for Google Search to even convince everyone to get this implemented. And this is multiple teams you are talking about here (I am guessing at least 5-6 including engg, QA, monetization, legal, support, branding etc).",1320357470

No code loading restrictions are placed upon such processes.</i><p><i>> Really? That's good news if true. Got a reference for that?</i><p><a href=""https://devforums.apple.com/thread/108004"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devforums.apple.com/thread/108004</a> (Apologies to anyone not registered as an Apple developer.)<p><i>> Furthermore, Lion-only apps could employ an XPC based plugin architecture and entirely avoid loading code into their address space.</i><p><i>> Please elaborate. I still don't see how XPC can be used to implement a plugin architecture, assuming the Apple documentation is correct in stating that XPC services need to be located inside the main application bundle in order to be loaded.</i><p>The app can modify its bundle, so that's not the problem. While I haven't actually tried this myself, there's nothing theroetically preventing the app from copying a service into its Contents/XPCServices directory in response to some user action that makes that service available to the sandboxed app (e.g. they double clicked a file that's of a type registered by the app, or they invoked an open panel within the app somehow).<p>The bigger problems, and ones that I can't find solid docs on are:<p>1) Does the service's signature need to match the parent app's signature? The docs actually indicate the service might not even need to be signed.<p>2) Can the app easily enumerate services, to discover new ones? Presumably, this should be possible but, again, I've never tried it myself.<p>In the end, it may well be that XPC isn't an option for 3rd party out-of-process plugins. In process plugins are, as noted above, not a problem though.<p><i>> Re: Thunderbolt -- the problem here is that even if a kernel extension driver is already installed, a sandboxed app can't access it. (The example case in my mind would be my own video capture app: it's got direct support for devices by Blackmagic Design, including their new Thunderbolt-based units. I'm using the vendor's API for this. If I were to sandbox this app, it would have to lose this functionality.)</i><p>Ah, gotcha. I'm a little surprised to hear about that restriction, as I was the BT and Firewire restrictions. I'd have expected all of those to work, as long as your app was only using user-space APIs. Is the mach port lookup restriction what kills these? Have you contacted WWDR? We've got a WWDR contact that has been very helpful and proactive.",1320356930

But here is an overview:<p>The school age people, although highly influenceable don't have spare cash mainly because they don't have a job (or just a part time job). So thats roughly your 15-25 group, you can sell them cheaper more fashionable items. Music has always been a real winner here because its cheap and fashionable.<p>The next major bracket is 25-35, people who have there first jobs, no real debts, and are trying to settle down or impress others. You can't really sell big ticket items here because they are often saving for a house or something, but medium range stuff you can.<p>between 35-50 its a wasteland, people have priorities that trump marketing, kids, mortgages etc... You won't see a lot of advertising targeted to this group unless its to do with kids or household items. Car manufacturers target this bracket a bit I think, but really its to much of a hard sell when there is easy money else where.<p>The next group is the 50-65, these people who suddenly have there lives back. Not a hugely impressionable group but will really splash out on the big ticket items. New cars, expensive holidays, this is where the real money is. Need a computer? buy something top of the line.<p>I remember hearing 45-55 chucked around a lot in meetings, this would be the mid life crisis bracket. More or less the same bracket as the 50-65 but I guess more impressionable due to the fear of getting old.<p>65+ it changes again because health starts to become an issue. Priorities start to trump.<p>So theres only two demographics with money 25-35, and 50-65. With the 50-65 being the real spenders.<p>Apple historical has had a majority 50+ user base, but recently has started selling very well in the 25-35 bracket. Co-incidence? I think not.",1320356089

I noticed Bell (phone company) is especially bad for leaving the boxes for their fibre terminals open. No one thinks its a big deal, because nothing happens to them.<p>One of my friends works for a cable company and occasionally has to patch a fibre connection, and whenever he does he has to run back to head office to pick up the mechanical splice and asked the guy one day ""Why don't they let me keep some of these in my truck?"" and got told ""Because it costs over 500 bucks"".<p>When he told me this all my mind went to was: It costs $500 plus time to repair a fibre bundle and Bell leaves boxes containing 20 or more bundles open.<p>If you'd have told that to a kid where I grew up, he'd be out there with bolt cutters as soon as it went dark because costing a company $10000 for their own stupidity would be awesome.<p>So I really don't get why companies leave these bundles unlocked and in plain view.

3193757,comment,3187350,3193500,2,0,xenophanes,,,"I was thinking it through more and I think it's the stopping procedures that might not halt that are the problem. You can have a data dependent stopping procedure if it's guaranteed to halt which makes sure all data does get counted.<p>For example of one that might <i>seem</i> bad, but does halt, and turns out to be OK:<p>Flip a coin until you have more heads than tails OR reach 500 flips.<p>This procedure will produce a majority of trials with more heads than tails, but I think the average over many trials will be 50/50. The conceptual reason is that stopping early sometimes prevents just as many heads as tails that would have come up after stopping. I haven't formally proved this but I did a simulation with a million trials with that stopping procedure and got a ratio of 1.0004 heads per tails which seems fine (and after some reruns, I saw a result under 1, so that is possible). Code here:<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/H42qHYbA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/H42qHYbA</a><p>With a guaranteed halt, a sequence of 500 tails and 0 heads can be counted. With no guaranteed halt, it's impossible to count a tails heavy sequence, which is not OK because it's basically ignoring data people don't like.<p>Does that make sense? I think it may satisfy the stuff you/Bayesians/Eliezer are concerned with. It means it's OK to stop collecting data early if you want, but you do need some rules to make sure your all your results are reported with no selectivity there.<p>There's also a further issue that these kinds of stopping procedures are not a very good idea. The reason is that while they are OK with unlimited data, they can be misleading with small data sets. It's like the guy who bets a dollar, and if he loses he bets two dollars, and if he loses again he bets 4 dollars (repeated up to a maximum bet of 1024 dollars). His expectation value in the long run is not changed by his behavior but he does affect his short term odds: he's creating an above 50% chance of a small win and an under 50% chance of a larger loss. If you only do 10 trials of this betting system, they might all come out wins, and you've raised the odds of getting that result despite leaving the long term expectation value alone. Doing essentially the same thing with scientific data is unwise.<p>BTW/FYI I believe I have no objections to the Bayesian approach to probability but I do think the attempt to make it into an epistemology is mistaken (e.g. because it cannot address purely philosophical issues where there's no data to use, so it fails to solve the general problem in epistemology of how knowledge (of all types) is created.)",1320355482

The main value-add is that users can easily +1 (share, tweet, whatever) from whatever page they're on. A secondary feature of some (including this one) is to show how many other people +1'd (etc) it. There are other extensions that exist with just the first part and not the second (though they're usually not 'official') and I imagine those wouldn't be ""tracking"" your activity (except what you're sharing).

I really only need a minimum mobile rig (low end dual core, 2 or 3 GB of RAM, 250GB HD) enough to be more than a netbook and have a 15"" screen, and I do <i>not</i> need an OS, I develop on Linux. I see these laptops like this go on sale on newegg for about $350, but I know I'm wasting near $100 dollars of this money on Windows, which I neither want nor need, I'd much rather pay $250 and install Ubuntu myself. The only places I see laptops without an OS are gaming websites, which sell at a minimum of $700 for laptops. Where can I find low end laptops with blank hard drives? I know I could get what I need for about $250 if only someone sold it! Does anyone know a website that sells laptops like this? Or one that supports incredibly vertical customization, down to this price range? Thanks!<p>P.S. As far as building, I've built three desktops, but never a laptop.

It's also part of the C.W. that institutional VC isn't going to invest in your C Corporation either; there's going to be thousands of dollars spent in restructuring your corporation one way or the other. It's probably <i>not true</i> that having an LLC is going to prevent you from getting an investment. If you're worth a VC round, you'll get a VC round; it's just a question of how much of that round will go to legal fees.<p>2. The tax issues for LLCs aren't particularly complex. In fact, tax simplicity is one of the reasons LLCs exist. If your LLC is paying you --- you're post-revenue --- <i>you need an accountant</i>. Don't DIY your taxes. I've done dumb things with taxes before. Learn from my errors: it's not worth the heartache to blow off your taxes. Just get an accountant.<p>3. There are common constructs used to grant equity to LLC employees (I believe they're formally ""restricted stock units"", but, ask your lawyer --- who you certainly needed to engage if you were building a C Corp). The bigger issue to my mind is the fact that the founders of an LLC, formally ""principals"", ""owners"", or ""partners"", technically aren't supposed to take W2 income, which makes taxes trickier.<p>Against all of this complexity just note that an LLC is <i>way</i> easier to set up than a C Corporation, and if it's between an LLC now and a C Corporation ""sometime soon but not quite yet"", please remember that the benefits of incorporating are significant:<p>* You are unlikely to lose your house in a contract dispute.<p>* You can invoice and be invoiced.<p>* Big companies will have a harder time rolling you into letting them withhold taxes for you when they pay you.",1320354020

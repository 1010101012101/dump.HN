To wit:<p><i>Theme and plugin developers have helped make WordPress the champion blogging platform that it is today without receiving a single dime of the $29.5 million in funding that Automattic raised last year. Both Matt Mullenweg and his company Automattic benefit financially from the hard work of plugin developers and theme designers. Yet it’s somehow justified in Matt’s mind that it’s not okay for plugin developers and theme designers to directly receive financial compensation for their contributions to WordPress.</i><p>To me, that reads as ""We've worked hard on Wordpress and we <i>deserve</i> to share in its success.""  The crazy thing is that a) as far as I can tell, not much has changed in terms of the rules, so if this wasn't a problem before, why is it a problem now?  And, b) no one is saying that developers and designers can't offer premium themes and plugins for pay, just that Wordpress won't host those assets for them.  How it that unreasonable?  Again, this goes back to this guy thinking that he <i>deserves</i> to be able to charge for stuff that Wordpress is hosting for him, for free.  Give me a break.",1245459362

Even though there are plenty of legitimate users of mIRC?<p>It seems more likely to me that there is some sort of objection to 'web clients' because desktop clients are the 'one true way' to access IRC. Note that I say this as someone that prefers to IRC from console clients like BitchX and irssi through a screen session.<p>I known plenty of people that have used IRC that don't 'know' what IRC really is other than how to use the graphical elements of their client to access things for the 'chat room'.<p>And in this case you are not 'providing' IRC accessibility. Mibbit is providing that. The only thing that you're doing is restricting accessibility by banning Mibbit.

666000,comment,665844,665844,0,0,RISCfuture,,,"This problem is studied deeply in the philosophy of color, and there are three major theories on the relationship between light, color, and experience:<p>The theory of physicalism states that an object's color is an intrinsic property of matter, that its color is determined by its atomic properties.  This theory is largely discredited in modern philosophy.<p>The theory of relationalism states that an object's color is determined by the atomic properties of the object in combination with physical properties of the environment: ambient light, reflection/refraction, diffusion, etc.<p>The theory of projectivism states that an object's color is a combination of its physical properties and the perception in the viewer; namely, that color is an experience tied to a dual system of subject and perceiver.  This is the generally accepted theory today.<p>There's a large body of work on the philosophy of color (most of it sitting in my girlfriend's bookshelf).

665990,comment,664621,664811,0,0,rjurney,,,"I feel like you read a different article than I wrote.<p>For one, Atlanta has the highest rate of entrepreneurism in the nation - true.  Unfortunately, almost all of those new businesses are not startups - they are under paid consultants and mom and pop shops.  Anyone who has ever attended a Technology Association of Georgia event knows this to be indisputable fact.  Corporate downsizing in our big-company town has driven this rate up.  A former executive selling management consulting, or a former factory worker selling bait does not a startup make.<p>As I said, the number of early stage deals in new ventures this year is very close to zero.  If you're connected with the angel community, you know this is true.  I didn't simply make it up.<p>As to customer-driven development, what I am suggesting is that we embrace a model that involves customers at the stage where new entrepreneurs tend to look for investment capital.  It is unfortunate that you didn't care for the article's tone, but I would encourage you to take a look into the customer development model - it has applicability in Atlanta, and elsewhere.<p>As to a profound misunderstanding - I'm not sure you read the article that I wrote.  Nowhere did I say that entrepreneurism is easy anywhere.  Its hard everywhere.  What I said was that Silicon Valley does support exceptional individuals with resources in every area to aid them in their success.  Think about the definition of exceptional: way, way above average.  People work hard in California, and they follow the California game plan and if they are exceptional, it often works.  That game plan simply does not work anywhere near as well in Georgia, because it is a fundamentally different business environment.  If you drew your livelihood from a startup in this area, you would probably understand that.<p>No offense, sir, but you seem to have been rubbed the wrong way by someone else, and you are taking it out on me.",1245457900

You can have a small home party with 10-20 people and it's fine. Throw in a hundred gate crashers and it becomes a nightmare.<p>The thing with the internet is the anonymity that is afforded by such communities means that there is less of a barrier for people to become jerks. Look at YouTube or 4chan.<p>Youtube has a huge population and the comments are filled with volatile diatribe. Conversely, look at Vimeo - it's a much nicer interface, yet it doesn't have the same community issues that Youtube has.<p>Now let's look at 4chan. It has a simplistic user interface, but with extreme anonymity and a large enough population, it's the cesspool of the web.<p>I just don't think your ""pretty interfaces = bad"" argument has any merit.<p>Digg wasn't half bad when it FIRST came out, but as more people flocked to it, the quality went down.

665977,comment,665546,665546,0,0,tolmasky,,,"I agree with all the points here except for the part about bit flags. Bit flags are still arguably the best way to store ""sets"" of non-duplicate information. For example, if I wanted to aggregate the kinds of nodes I'd want with John's API, I'd have to accumulate them in an array, then use apply() because I can't pass that array in. Then there's the problem of duplicates, and also easily being able to check, add, and remove. All these operations are of course possible with an array (even if they contain duplicates), but it seems a bit much to go down a route where all these operations are inherently O(N) when there is an O(1) solution that isn't <i>that</i> hard to learn. Additionally you can easily construct shorthands for often used combinations: ElementsAndText = Element | Text. In the array world, you're going to be having to concat arrays to achieve a similar effect. It's also really nice that you can say ""ALL"" just with 0xF...FFFF (-1) and be assured that it is future proof, whereas in the array world if new nodes creep in in the future, you have to now go back to every instance where you called this and add a new parameter. I suppose the ""easy"" fix for this is to just say that if nothing is passed in it means ""all"", or alternatively have an ALL constant.<p>We recently tackled a similar issue in Cappuccino and our solution was to create two parallel ways of specifying this information that were transparently convertible: a pure bit flags version and a strings version, such that (Selected | Highlighted) is equivalent to ""selected+highlighted"". You can pass in either the string form or the bit form to the methods, and you can convert between them as well. All in all, none of the ""JS people"" using our framework seemed to mind the use of bit flags.",1245456674

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.""",1245456611

It's up to you to find it.""<p>I am, currently, going to college. I have quite a bit of debt ($8K) and expect to get about double that by the time I'm finished. If you can show me a way to pay for college without debt, and I actually get the money, I will pay you $25 for every $100 I receive. So, if you can show me a way to get $200,000 for college (which I would have to come up with, somehow, if I weren't fortunate enough to get some scholarship money), you would get $50,000. If you can show me a way to get $20,000 to pay off my current and future debt, you'll get $5,000.<p>I can predict in advance, with fairly high probability (although I would obviously be delighted to be proven wrong), that you won't be able to come up with any way for me to get that sort of money, even given that you probably have more experience than I do, and even given an immediate large financial incentive. The reason why is obvious: $200,000, or even $20,000, is a <i>crapton</i> of money, especially when you're young, have no to little experience and are working hard as a full-time student. Most <i>adults</i>- people who have had full-time jobs for ten or twenty or thirty years- pay for items that cost that much on credit, because they <i>can't</i> afford it otherwise, even though they get socked with finance charges when they borrow.",1245456421

352068,story,,,2,0,anonymate,"ASK HN: I need a Linux desktop and programming workstation. Any advice?",,"My budget is $1500,  and I will use this as my main workstation for web development, publishing cross platform software (financial, mathematical, and data analysis), programming with Eclipse, Netbeans and the occasional Glade, experimenting with multicore programming in languages like C++, Java, Erlang and Haskell, experiment with NVIDIA CUDA programming in C, number crunching, database development, data mining and simulation software (both writing and running) and finally, regular office productivity (OpenOffice, Gimp, etc...), including substantial photo editing. Well, that's a lot of stuff, but I'll do each of them to a certain extent.<p>I'd like to get a Velociraptor (300GB) as my boot disk, and a larger disk for media files. This cuts my budget for a powerful quad core like the Q9550 though. I'm trying ECC configurations (I want 8GB of RAM) as well, on server boards, but the motherboards are double the price and so is the ram, so I can't get the 10000rpm disk. Please help me make a decision of what's really important and what components would you select.",1225716768

Programmers tend to prefer their games to be strictly rule-based simulations, but that's not necessarily what the target audience want and it doesn't equate to good game design.<p>I'm not saying that Spore is perfect, just that it's very easy as a game developer to get carried away with stuff that you find cool, only to find there's no game there.<p>The irony is that Chris Hecker is pretty much the man who popularised (and evangelised) the use of simulated physics in games. Virtually all papers on inverse-kinematics in games reference his essays.",1225716612

352063,comment,351351,351908,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Interesting.<p>In the U.S., the House of Representatives is specifically supposed to represent the taxpayers while the Senate represents the states (as you noted) For those of you concerned with runaway spending, the founders specifically charged the House with the pocketbook.<p>What happens, however, over time the House begins to realize that while you don't have taxation without representation (unless you're DC -- long story) you sure as heck can end up with completely disproportionate representation to the amount you are paying.<p>Or in other words I can get taxed $1 and you can get taxed $1 Million and we still have the same representation. To me this feels more like a prison system than a progressive one. If you proportionately had representation in the ""House of Taxpayers"" according to how much skin they had in the game, increases in taxes would amount to re-districting, and would be done with the utmost care.<p>Very interesting idea. On first glance, I like it.",1225715708

352055,comment,348774,348774,0,0,buridan,,,"What you are experiencing is called 'science'.  Normal science has around a 95% failure rate, great science is 1 in a million or billion.  Most science is 'the grind', collecting, considering, developing minor things, most of which end up to be wrong.  It is hard work, it is challenging work, and 5 years from now, you will either be part of something, or you won't.<p>If you think science is or could be otherwise, I think you are basically just fooling yourself by being completely unaware of history.  Science isn't 'hacking' something together and making it work, it is finding the answer, not just 'an answer', but 'the answer' and even then 'the answer' is likely to be shown to be wrong by someone else.  Knowing and learning what is wrong is as important as finding what is or could be right.<p>It sounds to me from what you say above that you want to be some sort of freelance creative computer consultant more than a researcher.<p>btw, no one needs another google, not because google is the best or anything, but because the model of centralization and massification has reached its potential and fails for too many people.",1225714573

The House of Lords is full of people who know (or used to anyway) that any problems they create, their own grandchildren would have to sort out. Regardless of anyone's feelings about heredity, that was a very valuable capability and it has now largely been lost.",1225714099

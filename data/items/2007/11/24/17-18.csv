83213,comment,83196,83196,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm curious: how many of those single exit/entry bugs were caused because a function mucked with global state?<p>Again, I haven't seen this problem in the wild, and I have trouble seeing how it <i>could</i> exist.  My functions tend to be actual <i>functions</i> - they don't touch state outside of the function (and lexically enclosing scopes, for closures) - and so if a function exits early, it just gives the wrong answer.  This is caught immediately by the unit tests; there's no place for bugs to hide and cause problems later.<p>The one exception is UI-intensive code, which often <i>requires</i> state because users expect their UI to change in response to distant changes.  For this, any ""hidden"" state is clearly documented and included in the tests, just as if it were the return value of the function.  All other destructive updates touch the UI, so they're fairly quickly visible when screwed up (and I have individual tests for subwidgets, that test the GUI components in isolation).<p>I see a lot of the tenets of structured programming as holdovers from when it was okay to mutate variables.  It's <i>state</i> that's the true cause of bugs, not single-entry-single-exit.",1195926866

With the exception of some trolling, the responses tended to be some  variant of ""try both and pick the one that best fits your head.""<p>I was struck by how little the Ruby community (at least at the time; this may have changed in the last year or two) seemed to care if other people dropped their current fav language to become Ruby converts.   Rather, the mood was, if you choose Ruby, great, we're here to help and welcome, but if you don't, we hope you choose something that makes you happy.",1195926139

83207,comment,81453,82252,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Buffet's success has always been based on having loads of ultra-cheap capital lined up from insurance companies he generally owns big stakes in.  He waits for obvious bargains at times when credit is tight and then acquires big positions.  He is not really an investment guru.  He has good connections.<p>People who do not understand this about Buffet try to extract more lessons from him than makes sense.  The lesson to get from Buffet is ""Have very rich business partners and friends.""  He got where he is by shaping the playing field to his advantage, not by having special investment skills and knowledge.<p>Buffet doesn't avoid technology because he ""doesn't understand it.""  He avoids technology because ALL he is looking for are temporarily depressed assets that he has an easier time lining up capital for than others.  It's rather oversimplifying, but he's kind of a one trick pony.  The theoretical MO of most investors is to allocate capital for new business opportunities, and that's just not what he does.",1195924749

It is essentially a magic enchantment that provides its recipient with an ability to gain a positive outcome of chance events at a frequency above those provided by normal probability. Sure, there are some people who will 'beat the odds' on a regular basis, probability provides for this, however more people report being lucky than the probability suggests as well.  Further, luck has a social connotation roughly equivelent to fortunate, but when the term lucky is used there is a nod to vague supernatural forces controlling outcomes, a la the Fates.<p>As such luck really cannot be isolated as a factor. Instead tho, people who claim to be lucky can easily be isolated. They can be studied for what makes them ""lucky"".

That's what allowed him to execute the dive perfectly on the ""first"" try.<p>The same effect comes into play in a breakup after a long relationship.

Here are a few answers:<p>- My experience is that the humidity isn't as bad as it's made out to be. Make sure it's properly heated in the winter, and if you can fit it in get a wood stove. That'll take care of all humidity problems. I've never had any problems with food, clothes, etc.<p>- I don't know about mooring prices in the US (or anywhere else for that matter) but my experience from Copenhagen is that if you can get into one of the smaller harbours that aren't as high-end and have a bit of fishing and other maritime business it's going to be a lot cheaper. Besides it's more fun! I pay around $1000 a year for mooring and access to water and electricity.<p>- I pay $900 a year in insurance. Again this is Denmark and I have no idea about US prices.<p>- Power is supplied by the harbour, and I've never had any problems. It seems as reliable as anywhere else.

1128976,comment,1128014,1128222,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Ok, here goes.<p>1. The Answers market is in a land grab mode<p>David argued that just because they had a home run in one niche, it didn't mean that they will have success in another niche.<p>I disagree.  The brilliance of Stack Overflow (SO) is that they've come up with a product that takes flows with how the internet works.\nPeople type questions into search engines constantly.   And, Google gives a high page rank to sites that provide frequently updated, quality content on a specific topic.  Stack Overflow has nailed that, and because of that, a large percentage of their search traffic is organic.   Stack overflow, has also solved a big problem that Yahoo answers has, which is reputation and trust.<p>I'm guessing the reason that they are interested in rapidly expanding SO to other markets, is Joel sees that this is how the internet currently works and SO has a 6-9 month lead on them in terms of technology and answer site savvy.  It's a good time to exploit that, in my opinion.<p>David also suggests via straw man argumentation that people typing questions like ""How to make swedish meatballs"" isn't a market worth chasing.   You'd have to ask the people at the Food Network that.  Joel  might be interested in licensing a ""Food Overflow"" to the Food Network's set of web sites.  Or, perhaps he would be interested in setting up a ""Home Repair Overflow"" for Home Depot.  Or, a ""Car Repair Overflow"" to Napa Auto Parts.   Speaking of which, my 2003 caravan is acting up, and I'd kill for a ""Car Repair Overflow"".<p>2. Stack Overflow is like Starbucks<p>Just because David can't see a reason for Stack Overflow to spend money doesn't mean that Joel cant.  SO has grown from zero to 6 million monthly unique visitors in 18 months with a staff of 6 people. I'm guessing that Joel is interested in adding dozens or hundreds of niche specific SO sites.  And, yes, if he is going to chase that option, then he needs a lot of capital to hire.<p>3. Stack Overflow wants to get on Techcrunch<p>Ummm.  No.  Read Joel's post.  That's not what Joel said. Again, another straw man by David.  Joel said that he was interested in publicity.  Publicity != Tech Crunch.  Publicity can also mean attention from old media outlets like television shows, and newspapers. And, answers site benefit particularly well from media attention and publicity.  One of the big reasons that SO was a success was because Jeff and Joel's blogs were so popular.  If SO can get some media attention in other markets, I'd wager could see explosive growth for other verticals as well.<p>David dispariaged expanding SO to other niches by suggesting that SO was going after kids interested in how to find 3 gold rings in Zelda.  I'm guessing that Joel is more interested in the consumer that asks ""How do I change the alternator on my 2003 Dodge Caravan"".  Someone asking that question ooking for advice on changing an alternator in a 2003 Caravan, is going to be in  the market to purchase that alternator.  Advertisers pay a premium to reach people at that point in the sales funnel.<p>4. The investor will give you advice, connections, and introductions<p>David has the balls to give Joel hell for raising money in order to get advice?  37 Signals took money from Bezos to ""get his advice"".  I'm just flat out calling bull shit on that one.  I'm really sick of 37 Signals guys talking out of both sides of their mouths about this subject.  They really have no room to talk on this one.<p>And, yes, investors often do have connections that young entrepreneurs can use.  I have a number of friends in funded startups that have gotten introductions to airline executives, banking executives, CFO's of large consumer product companies because they found investors that had experience in those industries.  It might not be an issue for 37 Signals, because they are sell ebooks, chat and TODO lists to Rails Developers, but if your business has anything to do with medium to large businesses, then the introductions come in really handy.<p>5. Taking money means big exit or IPO<p>""I don't know if you heard, but IPO markets aren't all that interested in eyeball companies without the numbers to back them up"".  Fog Creek makes $1 million a year on a job board that he advertises on his blog.  37 Signals also makes a bunch of money off their job board.  There are more ways to monetize eyeballs than just advertising.  SO is already doing that.<p>And, Silicon Valley is full of people that have made a bunch of money off of big exits or IPO's. Have you looked at the real estate market in the area?  One of the reasons that it's so high, is because Google's first 1000 employees were all millionaires.  Yahoo, Ebay, HP, Intel, Cisco, Sun, Oracle...  Living here, you're surrounded by people that have made a killing off of options.  Living in Chicago, you'd never see that, so I can see where David's myopia comes from.<p>The IPO market isn't over, and the merger and acquisition market is warming up.  The last 10 years of financial and real estate hubris are collapsing before our eyes, and investors are going to be looking for places to make big returns again.  It's just a matter of time before companies like Facebook, Yelp or Twitter IPO, and I'd be wiling things in the tech world will begin to look a lot different.  Also, there's a bunch of companies in the economy that laid off a lot of people and they are now sitting on tons of cash.  Those companies are going to be interested in growing, and acquisitions are a very nice way to do that.<p>A founders chances of getting a large company to look at her startup as a potential acquisition are better if they have already been valued at $10 million post money, than if it's 4 guys in their garage with a website.  There's a reason that Del.icio.us took investment before they got picked up by Yahoo.<p>6. Taking VC will make your company successful<p>Joel said that taking VC makes sense if it meant you could grow the company and the founder wasn't interested in self aggrandizement.  Joel has written a number of times that one of the problems that he saw with a self funded company, is that his employees don't have a huge upside potential.  Upside can be shared with employees via options and an IPO.  A quick acquisition for $6 million based on 3x annual revenues... not so much to share with employees.<p>I don't get the impression that Joel is doing this because he wants the money personally.",1266333387

Keeping the value system for evaluating people's performance and the wealth they create secret, only leads to subjective standards and gives the keeper of the secret far too much power. To the contrary, I think that only metrics as known and objective as monetary value can ever be useful, as otherwise lots of productivity would be wasted in pursuit of the wrong (secret) metrics.<p>It may be true that at any given point in time, there may be some wrongfully inflated monetary high scores. I think they always get detected over time, though. Are there any wrongfully inflated high scores over the course of time? I think not, as there is wealth to be created in detecting the frauds.

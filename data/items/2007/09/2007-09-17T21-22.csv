55915,comment,55849,55849,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I like these numbers.  As someone pushing an Open Source based business along, Open Source businesses selling for huge prices is a nice thing for me to see...XenSource went for 500mil not more than a month ago.  Zimbra 350mil.  Both sit either side of us on the continuum of applications (and we've got a mail stack with webmail like Zimbra, though not as advanced, and a virtualization management product more feature-laden than XenSource have).<p>I'm gonna act like I don't know any of y'all when I'm cruising around on my mega-yacht.  That's all I'm saying.",1190066178

55901,comment,55882,55882,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I recently saw a demo of Invention Machine, which does semantic extraction of a body of data. They integrate it with engineering processing tools, and their target market is companies that have a process that they can improve.<p>The problem with semantic search is that out of context, it doesn't buy you much. Note how many of the demos of Powerset have been on a tiny body of data.<p>I'm very familiar with the state of art in natural language processing. Invention Machine is pretty good. Powerset seems pretty good.<p>It is silly to think that Google, with a mass of excellent engineers and folks like Norvig heading the effort, will be beaten because Powerset will go public with semantic search features sooner.<p>Google certainly has people working on it. Even a marginal improvement on search or adWords relevance would get them millions. Unless they are already a sloth of a big company, there is a reason such features aren't released. My guess is that the techniques aren't good enough yet to take on the entire web.",1190063412

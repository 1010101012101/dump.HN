A treaty must be ratified by the Senate, but the Budapest Memorandum was just an unratified political agreement. We do however have a formal treaty with Japan that guarantees military assistance.<p>Furthermore it didn&#x27;t say anything about the United State&#x27;s obligations to protect Ukraine with our nuclear umbrella. It only said that the US (along with Russia and Great Britain) would: respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine; not use force, economic pressure, or nuclear weapons against Ukraine; and seek UN Security council action if nuclear weapons were used against Ukraine.<p>Nowhere does it say we are under any obligation to respond with military force if another country invades Ukraine, it just says <i>we</i> won&#x27;t invade.",1402210149

7864138,comment,7863856,7864111,21,0,lobster_johnson,,,"They are conceptually very different.<p>Rabbit is a broker based on the AMQP model of exchanges, queues and bindings. Producers and consumers talk to Rabbit, which processed, stores and dispatches messages across the cluster. It supports both direct (one message goes to a single consumer) and fan-out (every message goes to all consumers) delivery, and can pick targets based on wildcard routes. Queues can be &quot;durable&quot;, where Rabbit will store messages on disk atomically in case of a crash. You can restart Rabbit, as well as producers and consumers, and the queues will still be intact.<p>ZeroMQ is (despite the name) not a message queue in the classical sense; it&#x27;s more like multicast TCP or UDP, with some message queue functionality. To start, since Zero is embedded in each program, a &quot;queue&quot; does not persist if a producer and consumer are not both running; any buffering occurs in the consumer, so if a producer emits messages and no consumers are running, the messages are lost. Similarly, there is no durability; all messages must be handled right away.<p>ZeroMQ is a low-level toolset for implementing robust messaging -- it could be used to implement a high-level broker like Rabbit, but in itself it doesn&#x27;t compete directly.",1402209794

In  1984 MCI wanted in, so that&#x27;s one of the major reasons AT&T was broken up.<p>The court realized that they companies should be restricted from these other markets, like long distance because they could vertically integrate-- ie, combine local, long distance, broadband, and control the wire.<p>Long distance -- while that market has been diminishing year by year, in 1996, the incumbents wanted to get into this market, so they created the &quot;Telecom Act of 1996&quot; to trade off-- opening the networks in exchange for entering long distance.<p>If you look at any triple play they still have a long distance component-- about $12 bucks.. not counting taxes and while many might go voip - the average customer just wants the thing to work.<p>if you want the full history search for the &quot;Unauthorized Bio of the Baby Bells&quot; -- also a free download, with Foreword by Dr. Robert Metcalfe.

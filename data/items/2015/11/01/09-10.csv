Buying access to stuff online with a credit card is totally inconvenient, and even worse, you have no privacy then. I guess this is part of the reason why sites financed by advertising have become so prevalent.<p>Personally, if there was an easy and private way to do so, I&#x27;d much rather pay for content than getting &quot;free&quot; stuff financed by ads. Inevitably, sites will be extremely reluctant to write anything negative about products from companies that buy lots of ads. For this reason, I consider many of the reviews on tech sites, for example, kinda worthless.<p>So, I&#x27;m glad to see this ad financed business model break down. Buying access to content with a cryptocurrency could be real easy (and relatively private). But it does not help that many governments want you to calculate capital gain/loss everytime you make such a purchase.<p>I think governments ought to make an exception in the capital gains tax for small personal purchases. Maybe promoters who loudly proclaim that cryptocurrencies will soon replace &quot;legacy&quot; government fiat currencies are part of the problem. No wonder governments are so negative. But I don&#x27;t think cryptocurrencies necessarily will replace fiat currencies anytime soon. Cryptocurrencies work great for small purchases online, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to put my lifesavings into one - oh no!

Obviously this part of the equation is _preference_<p>But the problem is I am dying to find something in LA but it&#x27;s just really hard to find a tech company you&#x27;d want to work for where because there&#x27;s usually only one company in that space.<p>For example. Let&#x27;s say I want to find a job involving &quot;bitcoin&quot; I search and find this link[0]. Ignoring all the links to companies that no longer own their own domain names, NO ONE HAS ANY SPECIFIC JOB OPENINGS. 3 of the sites I went to give a generic form for you to enter info if maybe you are interested. But nothing specific.<p>Okay so maybe bitcoins are not a good startup idea in LA, let&#x27;s go for Drones. Everyone LOVES drones right? So I goto &quot;drones&quot;[1] on that same website. There&#x27;s like 8 links there, half of them don&#x27;t go anywhere and the rest have no specific job positions either.<p>Part of the lure of SFBA is that your options are pretty varied but also the depth of each tech space is relatively deep. Don&#x27;t like this company in tech space Y? Try the 4 other companies in that same field.<p>You can&#x27;t even get two options in LA. You can either goto Snapchat if you want to be part of the big social media company or you can join... what?<p>You can go with the hot online dating startup Tinder, or.... what?<p>There is literally no alternative to seek another company in the same space in LA because most likely the company doesn&#x27;t exist. You don&#x27;t really have the freedom to still be in a certain tech category while avoiding certain companies in that space.<p>About the only tech space you have options in is if you want to be part of a tech boutique shop that does custom websites for the big movie companies. I know people in that field and they seem happy with what they&#x27;re doing so if that is your thing, LA could work out.<p>Oh yeah and they also pay kinda shitty considering LA (especially Venice, Santa Monica, Playa Vista where Rubicon is) is not cheap. And although I&#x27;m sure some companies do offer free snacks/perks, I&#x27;ve heard a lot where they aren&#x27;t expected to provide that because it&#x27;s LA, not SF.<p>Yes yes, no free snacks, first-world-problems and all that.

It&#x27;s part of a law saying &quot;No Nazis, and no bullshitting about what they did&quot;[1]. If you look at your own quote, you&#x27;ll see it says &quot;grossly plays down&quot;. The scale of the Holocaust was large - there was a heap of physical evidence, and tens of thousands of eyewitnesses. And it&#x27;s not a topic that has had little research - to characterise the story of the holocaust as springing forth from the mouths of politicians is grossly misleading.<p>Denying the holocaust altogether is not research - it&#x27;s an attempt to <i>stifle</i> research for political gains. It moves the needle from &#x27;what actually happened&#x27; to &#x27;did it happen at all&#x27;, wasting resources - the same needle-moving tactics are seen in intelligent-design and anti-climate-change arguments, stopping productive conversation on a topic to further a political goal.<p>Finally, note that these laws limiting freedom of speech around holocaust denial are particular to that topic and nazism. The &#x27;slippery slope&#x27; argument hasn&#x27;t taken hold; it&#x27;s not these laws that are limiting freedom of speech (hell, even with &quot;the American concept of free speech&quot; you still have Free Speech Zones, National Security Letters, and copyright that lasts for author&#x27;s life + 70 years). The laws don&#x27;t stop you from doing research into the shitty things the Allies did. They don&#x27;t stop you researching Nazism in general or the Holocaust in particular. They only stop you playing politics from pretending that something does&#x27;t exist when it has tens of thousands of eye-witnesses, troves of physical evidence, and heavy existing research on the topic.<p>Europe has a problem with violent nationalism; cutting off this particular avenue helps alleviate that, and doesn&#x27;t do harm in return.

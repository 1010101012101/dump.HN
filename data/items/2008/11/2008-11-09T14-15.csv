358275,comment,358256,358256,0,0,tdavis,,,"While I wholeheartedly agree that there are many things wrong with ""kids these days,"" completely abolishing adolescence would... what's a good word here... suck! Look, I did my fair share of dumb stuff when I was younger, most of which was done in the name of boredom. But what's the alternative here? ""Happy 13th birthday, son, now go get a job!""?<p>If high STD and drug use rates tell us anything, it's that these young people are, on average, too immature to assume adult roles. I adore the feelings of achievement that being an entrepreneur/adult have brought me, but at the same time I recognize the fact that ""being a kid"" wasn't as bad the article makes it out to be. I spent most of my time playing video games, hanging out with friends and, yes, doing drugs! OMG! But you know what, at the end of the day, it was still <i>fun</i>.<p>I think we as a society should do everything in our power to encourage young people to focus on school so that they don't get dragged down into the worlds of drug addiction, poverty, etc. However, the reason I had so much time to dick around during my adolescence/teenage years was mainly because school was far too easy and not engaging enough. The entire schooling system is not nearly as progressive as it needs to be. Furthermore, there are not nearly enough reasons to excel at it. Working hard in high school just means you can get into a good college where you have to work even harder (and, unless you <i>really</i> excel or are financially secure, take a long-term monetary hit for the privilege) and the reality is that where one attended college is rarely relevant today.<p>School should be designed to provide useful knowledge instead of information that is merely cataloged, regurgitated, and forgotten. It should encourage and enable young people to find something they are passionate about and learn relevant things about that and gain useful experience in the process. The only classes that I worked hard to excel in and go beyond the bare minimum were programming and writing courses. It should come as no surprise that these are the two topics I am most passionate about to this day.",1226242374

I set up a mail client to download mails weeks ago and it was downloading them 1 at a time (seems like a server limitation), so it wasn't a problem until today, when it downloaded first unread messages ever. I didn't suspect it because it's been operating for weeks in the background and didn't cause any problems.<p>Thanks for help!",1226241565
358271,comment,358256,358256,0,0,peakok,,,"It is naive to assume that ""adolescence"" was a concept invented out of the blue, then deliberately experimented by some politics, it <i>never</i> works this way. The opposite is true : at some point we needed a word to describe a change in society, and a new cultural phenomenon that didn't exist before. Then was born the concept of adolescence and the teenager, wich is a worldwide phenomenom in Occident and other parts of the world.<p>Necessity is the mother of all virtues. People responsabilise when there is a need for it, especially when there is no other choice. Should the economic crisis worsen and make our life tougher, you'll see a lot of young people do whatever it takes to support their family and take a more serious stance on life and politics.<p>Some people are afraid that young people cannot responsabilise because of their education. I would argue that the same people underestimate (1) the potential of the young people, wich fuels the problem, and (2) underestimate the greatest educator of all : necessity.",1226241533

If you are referring to a lunar satellite kind of mission, this is not true.
""Chandrayan- I"" is their very first shot at it.
Even the launch vehicle (PSLV) has a very good track record.

358265,comment,357538,357992,0,0,dhimes,,,"Interesting argument, but now let's assume that Comcast builds it, promising unlimited internet and that they won't throttle users.  Then they change their mind.  What can you do?  As a town, you might be able to revoke Comcast's charter, and then build your own anyway, but you've certainly wasted some time (and probably money in the legal battle with Comcast).  Not to mention torquing off the residents who don't know enough to care.<p>A town, on the other hand, can hold the leaders directly responsible.<p>On a broader point, perhaps the town should be able to decide whom they trust more--the local business person (who you've painted to be competent, but that isn't always the case), or their own manager (who may be excellent, in any isolated instance).",1226240420

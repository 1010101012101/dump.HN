3337572,comment,3336656,3337402,1,0,masklinn,,,"> It was about a family that decided to relocate to be closer to their son's doctors at Duke.<p>It was not exactly a decision, leaving a 3 years old child for 6 months in a medical environment tends to be a rather hurtful option for everybody.<p>> They also decided to stop working during their son's treatment to better take care of him.<p>Outside the US, there are UHC countries with (paid) caretaker leave, or allowing parents to use (paid) sick leaves to take care of young children if needs arises. In Sweden, they could have taken up to 364 days at 80% salary (and a further 550 days at 75% salary). And even without that, this would generally be protected circumstances: the employer would not be allowed to fire the employee for taking unpaid leave to take care of his/her child, not without taking significant (monetary) risks.<p>> By starting to talk about the need for universal health care, the entire conversation changes away from what was a simple story about the power of social media to help people.<p>I'd expect that people in here try to get to the root of the problem instead of praising band-aids. Praising band-aids is good, but insufficient: band-aids are a short-term solution to potentially systemic problems.",1323525582
3337571,comment,3337365,3337365,1,0,pedalpete,,,"Can you give an idea of where you are with your start-up? Just because you 'want an investment' doesn't mean your ready. Many people suggest you should get introductions long before you actually need the money.<p>But to answer your question about how to contact investors, the best way is through personal contacts. Depending on where you live, this could be more or less difficult. You'll  also need to 'sell' your start-up to the contacts first. I doubt a contact would do an introduction for you without knowing what they were introducing. Use this to your advantage. Pitch any contacts you have who might be able to introduce you to investors. This will also give you practice with your pitch and help you refine it.<p>You can also try AngelList, but my understanding (I've never tried it) is that you'll need to have social proof to really get anywhere on the platform.<p>Are there technology/entrepreneur meet-ups in your area? If so, go to them. You may not meet investors there (though you might), but you will meet other start-ups and somewhere somebody is getting an investment and they have contacts in the angel/VC community.<p>Lastly, keep in mind that it isn't about what 'you' want. You have to sell the investor on your business and you. It's what THEY want. Telling them that you want investment so you can grow your business, etc. etc. I'm told won't get you very far.<p>It is better to tell them what you're building, where it is going, why it is going to change the world and make a ton of money. Ask for advice, not investment. Ask for investment and you'll get advice, ask for advice and you'll get investment.",1323525470

They want a home screen icon they can tap once and get an application with native look and feel.  If developers can write that app in HTML5/JS then it's a win/win for both developers and users.

But the decisions of individuals and small companies to choose or not choose to buy health insurance are much more strongly driven by their own personal health, with less-healthy people and people who suspect they're likely to have health problems soon more likely to buy in, and healthy entrepreneurs more likely to opt out / self-insure.",1323524230

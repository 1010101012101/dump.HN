This is something Alexis Ohanian mentioned when he started talking about SOPA and PIPA on TV, and I recall that point being dismissed pretty quickly (although unfairly). This article addresses the core problem of convenience. It reminds me of why Grooveshark exists: their mission statement is to compete with piracy by offering a better experience than downloading or torrenting music. It actually delivers on that. The artists still get paid while Grooveshark legally and safely operates within the DMCA. For $5/month, I can listen to all the music I want on my mobile device using Grooveshark, and I know that they're going to take care of all the royalty distribution going on in the background.",1328349518

3550711,comment,3548445,3549462,3,0,yason,,,"* Most management responsibilities have nothing to do with technical matters. A manager should serve the developers, not order them around.*<p>Exactly. That's what good management does: insulate the programmers from as much nonsense that is possible. A good manager has some grasp of the field so that he can block at least the most outrageous feature requests from the devs or at least delay asking about them until a weekly meeting or something. If the devs have problem, the manager will drive the issues through the cogs and clogs of the organization and bureaucracy instead of using valuable developer time to track those issues.<p>An anecdote: I have had travelling arranged by a competent office manager and a company-wide travel reservation and approval system. Guess which saved so much time from everyone, sending an email to the office manager ""I need to fly to X next Tuesday, my boss on Cc: with this"" and afterwards dropping a stack of receipts back to her for filing reimbursements, or a dozen people trying to figure out what's the best way through the travel system without sacrificing too much work time on that and still ending up scanning individual receipts for uploading to the system.",1328348874

3550705,comment,3548445,3548445,2,0,scotty79,,,"I think the problem is that people are allowed to open their physical mouths when they are in the presence of the developers.<p>I worked in one company that was managed nearly perfectly. If someone came to the developer to tell him something, he wasn't met with ""hello"". He was met with ""Write a ticket!"". Even though all employees occupied almost undivided space of less than 50 sq meters.<p>Ticket system was only legal means of communication. Tickets had to be written well because you had no other way to reach the developer with your message. From time to time developer came to the ticket issuer to verify some details but he might as well just ask further details in ticket comments.<p>There was one half an hour meeting per week that was attended by product manager that knew what she wants and two or three programmers working on the interconnected parts of the same thing. Product manager was available for instant contact for the developers at any time and had enough decision power to respond instantly.<p>Developer could talk to the other developer when he had an issue or was interested in what the other developer was doing and if he has any issues. These ""meetings"" where usually announced via skype or happening at natural time when target developer was already out of zone because he was just getting back from toilet of with fresh cup of tee.<p>There were of course ""sky is falling"" events that needed to be responded to urgently. There were communicated to developers by product manager via skype or in person but they were rare and serious enough so the developers wanted to deal with them in the first place to get ""I just saved the day"" feeling.<p>Ticket system was the communication hub, wiki and google docs were the knowledge hub. Skype was when you have to ask someone about something but you don't want to make noise or interrupt them. And mouths were for drinking tee (or coffee) and swapping short remarks with the developer that is at the moment looking at the same physical screen as you do.<p>And no slacking off because you monitor is visible to everybody.<p>I think that the issue described by the blog post author would be resolved by ""boss"" telling Sue to describe step by step how to reproduce the issue or record a movie of her reproducing the issue and create a ticket for the developer with that description or the link to that movie. Boss could further (if it's really important) ask the developer politely at 30 minutes Monday meeting if he could take a look at this issue (after checking of course before the meeting if developer didn't do that yet).<p>If you allow for other thing of communicating business issues (like email, skype, meat flapping) then the ticket system becomes cargo cult device that no one really pays attention to.",1328348624

When looking back to my life, I think the moments I were going forward were the happy times - the ones backward were a bit harder.<p>You've got to decouple your happiness sentiment from your overall self-worth. People's happiness doesn't grow much once they've got 50000$ a year a famous study said. But one's self-worth still grows when millions of $ are adding. Once you've conscious of the difference between the two, you start decoupling a bit your happiness from your success. Of course, you can't totally, but letting things a bit loose helps your health, stress, and life quality. Trying too much is dangerous.<p>Last, don't forget life isn't undimensional (god would that be boring if so). Beside the success you define, there are friends, love, entertainment elsewhere. It's not a path, rather a space where you can go to many many directions <i>additionally</i> to the success strategy you define for yourself.",1328348360

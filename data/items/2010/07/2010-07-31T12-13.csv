Of course, as the number of notes grow, many people will experience information overload and have trouble finding the forest for all the trees...this is where using specialized tools that are optimized for finding what you need will help you.<p>My blog post regarding large amounts of information

Now that I think about it, it makes a little bit of sense. I hypothesize that the target market is different than sites like Hacker News, Reddit, and even Digg- StumbleUpon requires less effort and less contribution to a ""geeky"" community. I'm not saying this is necessarily a good thing, but they have found a way to get user submissions from people who would never get themselves involved in other social sites, so it's working for them.<p>Anyone have thoughts on this theory?",1280580048

1563644,comment,1561155,1563188,0,0,briandarvell,,,"I have tried both PB and Freemind and I still have trouble grasping the use.<p>I say Procrastination-forming because in my experience with these kind of tools you end up spending more time formatting and aesthetic-izing your stuff than actually doing notetaking.  Look at the demo video on the main homepage and one thing they emphasize is on putting small icons beside the bubbles and having neat background colors.<p>I say Pseudo-notetaking becuase this tool is actually more geared towards structure than creation.  Your video for instance doesn't show anything related to my idea of notetaking.  Notetaking means you are writing down quotations or details upon ideas that you're listening or reading about because you wish to remember them or study later.  Notetaking, in my mind, is not limited to linking Ayn Rand as an author and 1902 as a birth year.  There's no depth to anything.<p>In the end if you say it works for you then go for it.  But I'm just saying that if it's really notetaking you're interested in then I really don't think this is the program to use.",1280579688

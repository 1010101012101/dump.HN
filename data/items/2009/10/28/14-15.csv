This is largely a philosophical argument, even though it's framed practically, so I will counter it philosophically;<p>The argument fails to incorporate some very basic and well understood market mechanism. A company whose products consumers are forced to buy (either because they are subsidised or because they have a government-enforced monopoly) are less inclined to invest and take risks in development. Why take a risk when people are already buying what you have today and can't go anywhere?<p>Another factor is political interference and the ensuing ICan'tBelieveItsNotCorruption. What happens when the pipes clog up before there's budget for increasing bandwidth because more people than expected are downloading and seeding torrents? Is the memo that says that it's mostly porn and piracy anyway, and we can just block the ports going to be ignored over pumping money in new bandwidth? To help people get porn? Protect the children, save money and get re-elected -- all in one firewall.<p>Yes, absolutely, a government run business can be more efficiently than a private one, and sometimes if can get some infrastructure in place where it simply isn't practical for for private actors to work. But it's never because they don't have to make money for their owners.",1256741985

The effect on your working day is negligible, especially as it can often take you out of rush hour traffic and you'll likely leave and arrive home around the same time (supposing you don't live in an area where the rush hour is more like three-hours).<p>You then have an extra day, essentially a 3-day-weekend every week. This can actually dramatically decrease costs, not only time wise and fuel wise, but if you have children who have to go into daycare or to a babysitter after school then it means lower childcare expenses. Not only that, but having a friday or monday off means you can get groceries and such done during the day and well out of the supermarket rush hours; you wouldn't believe how empty stores can be even before a major holiday.<p>Swapping, not only yourself but your workers too, to a 4 day week could keep you able to be there directing people, it'll at least take 1/5 of your wasted commute time and it could potentially shorten your commute dramatically if you commute time gets pushed outside of rush hour.

I have worked with professional athletes, college swimmers, and desk jockeys alike.<p>Get yourself a good massage therapist, I don't know where you are, but find a qualified professional on www.AMTA.org. be sure to ask them questions about whether they have dealt with chronic wrist pain in the past, and they can show you a series of stretches and/or exercises to help you be more pain free.  Now, I truly hope massage can help your situation, letting symptoms go unattended to is definitely a BAD idea, as prolonged compression of a nerve can lead to permanent nerve damage.  You should feel some relief after your first session, but I would highly recommend going once a week for 30 minutes to an hour for at least the first 3 weeks of treatment.  Your therapist should work on the small passageway of your ulnar nerve right at the base of your wrist below your little finger  as this area often gets compressed from keeping your wrists pointed IN and your hands turned out to stay aligned with the keys.  The wrist flexor and extensor muscle attachments should also be attended to at the top of the forearm near the elbow and on the underside of your forearm as well.<p>Another very immediate thing you can do is to purchase an ergonomic keyboard with the split down the center, this allows the wrists to be at a much more normalized angle than traditional keyboards.  Also look at how your mouse is...if it's straight up and down, with the two click buttons evenly placed at the top, this is not the mouse for you.  Ideally, a mouse at an angle to fit your hand with a trackball on the thumb side is what you're looking for.  Try and find a mouse with an offset right and left click button to follow the natural difference in first and second digit finger length.<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at my office,<p>Andrea J.

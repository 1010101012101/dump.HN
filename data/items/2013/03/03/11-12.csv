I think so, and for the same reasons why growing your own food might also be a good idea.  It makes you more independent and more resilient, and reduces your dependency upon increasingly centralised systems which are vulnerable to failure or being co-opted by parties who don't care about your interests.

(I'm not an expert on this stuff so I don't have a whole list of links at hand to back up these statements, but pretty much every actual expert that I've seen writing about this topic seems to agree. I've given a couple of links for formal support in earlier posts here.)<p>I will obviously defer to the experts; however, to be honest it is hard to apply that logic to a real life example I have been known to use:<p>Did you see the superbowl? SF was getting KILLED until the second half, then they made it a good game.<p>I have used kill and killed in the sports context, so according to the experts logic my usage of kill/killed does a great to normalize killing in our culture, and it makes actual killing seem a routine part of life.  I find it harder to believe that by using kill/killed in this context I may have encouraged my peers to not see killing as a big deal, which in turn makes them more likely to kill.",1362309599

Only selected few could afford to NOT work in farming.\nEven America, just 200 years ago had 90% of its population working as farmers.<p>Why such a desperate trend to make everyone grow their own food again? Sure, the food industry is not always honest,not always as good as your own home-grown food, but still - it allowed us to do something else with our lives, and pushed our societies an order of magnitude ahead.<p>As much as people should APPRECIATE farming, I don't think that everyone should do it. We produce enough food as it is.\nWe should teach kids how to code however, not because we need more programmers(which we do,but I digress) - but because it's the easiest way to introduce kids to logical, technical-like thinking. That way we can have more mathematicians, physicists, astronomers, engineers - people who we can afford to keep alive(almost literally) because they do not need to grown their own food anymore! They can sit at their desks for the whole day, thinking how to make the world better, instead of looking at how the crops grow.<p>I would say - why not give kids both? Is it too much to ask? Show them how vegetables are grown, how animals are cared for and how are they slaughtered, but at the same time, yes, please teach them how to code.",1362309426

Probably not a big deal for SSLizing a normal website, or even for accepting credit cards), since they're a decent-sized US company with legal liability, although I'd be concerned about their internal security vs. your own internal security (since you're still fully exposed on your side, too -- it doesn't improve security, and can at best not be a source of new vulnerability).<p>2) Their DNS doesn't appear particularly redundant; it's just anycast in one big block.  Using CloudFlare for DNS seems to be bad practice; you should use something else and cname to CF.  Ideally something with multiple DNS servers either individually anycast or in at least two independent (probably anycast) netblocks.<p>3) Performance of the proxy service seems adequate in my experience but for sites with large amounts of overseas-source traffic, I've heard of people getting lots of suspected-bad-guy path.

They don't help at all with dynamic content due to having poorly located nodes and lots of heavyweight code running in their proxy. Their lack of many nodes in good positions (compared to something like CDNetworks or Akamai, they are one or two orders of magnitude smaller) also means they can't provide very good latency even for the times when they actually happen to have something in cache.<p>(Note: if someone is now going to say CDNs don't generally do well with dynamic content, they are wrong: normal CDNs actually improve the performance of dynamic content incredibly by maintaining large-window pre-connected HTTP sessions to customer origin servers, often over private networks that already provide better bandwidth: you can easily see 2x latency improvements with a normal CDN even for fully dynamic content).<p>So, they really shouldn't be compared with a ""CDN"": they have an interesting service that actually provides something valuable for many key use cases (4chan comes to my mind: in essence, something that is actually likely to experience a true DDoS attack sufficiently often and with sufficiently little provocation that it makes sense to add an external system to your infrastructure), but if you need a ""CDN"" there are many more reasonable alternatives that don't have as many moving parts and are thereby going to break much less often (and, if they actually do, should break only in localized regions).",1362308451

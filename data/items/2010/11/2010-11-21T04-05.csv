Somewhere, I probably still have a moleskine with notes on the matter.  A couple things I remember:<p>-Crop Rotations:  The texts I read about this subject were the result of some very painstaking note-taking, and keeping all this information straight can confound even the very studious.  We had at least 3 copies of Elliot Coleman's ""The New Organic Grower"" around and they were all falling apart from constant reference.  Having instant access to your planting history would be invaluable, especially if coupled with pH effects of relevant crops and other useful info.<p>Certifications:  The process for getting that nifty ""certified organic"" label is quite difficult.  You have to submit all sorts of things.  It was even worse for us because we had commercial kitchen equipment (we sold jarred jams, salsas, etc)<p>Marketing: We sold shares of our output through a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) program.  ~100% of people who partook found out about us from meeting us at a farmer's market.  I think there's a decent market for CSA shares, but not really any way of comparison shopping, or even knowing what's available.<p>It would be neat to work on a project to solve these problems while simultaneously encountering them on the day-to-day.  But fair warning: ""plowing the fields all day"" does not really leave one in the mood for hacking.  Contemplation? Surely.  Conversation? Absolutely.  But I wouldn't expect to get a whole lot of hacking done, at least not in your first season.",1290315599

The basic design concept is to have one largish thermal envelope that encloses multiple garden and dwelling spaces that are kept at a relatively constant temperature year round.<p>I would really like to bring the Whole Earth Catalog hacking tradition full circle.",1290315595

I don't mean some highly involved complex AI, I mean just something that picks its moves slightly better than random. These things are perfect for a genetic algorithm, or an ant-colony-like simulation (Look up John Koza's books on how to do this right). Also, if you are a two-member team, and this is your <i>biggest</i> problem (which it sounds like it is - you have a product and no users!) then you should devote time to it.<p>2.

I ask because I might've been sympathetic to these kinds of views before I started grad school at the University of Arizona. Most students in grades K - 16 are not going to do intensive projects or actual work; many of them simply aren't ready to do so. Most students in most subjects are there because they need the spur and structure school provides.<p>This is true even at very high levels; how many people would <i>actually</i> write a dissertation if not for the fact that they'd already spent several years in grad school, that their professional lives depend on it, and they'll look like a fool if they don't? Hell, even <i>with</i> those constraints, there are a shockingly high number of ABDs floating around out there.<p><i>Schools, to the extent that they exist at all, should be more like graduate study where an advisor suggests resources for further study. These advisors could be unpaid volunteers.</i><p>This is insane. It does not scale. If volunteers did a better job of educating than the system we have now, no one would send their kids to mediocre public schools.<p>All of your ideas are wildly utopian, and I don't mean that in a good way.

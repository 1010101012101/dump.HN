10649108,comment,10644381,10647658,0,0,level3,,,"Your analogy is clouded by emotion, since it appeals to the notion that we shouldn&#x27;t be able to pick some arbitrary number and then be able to compare the quality of universes. Comparison of universes is multifaceted, so it seems nonsensical, but it actually becomes very possible when you reduce the universes to a single number, and thus make it a question about a probability space.<p>Let&#x27;s use your protocol. We arbitrarily choose a number R. Then we find out our universe&#x27;s number A. So now our question is, what is the probability that B is further away from A than R (and in the same direction)?<p>This might seem intractable because we don&#x27;t know anything about the way A and B were chosen. But in fact, we don&#x27;t need to. We&#x27;re not actually trying to calculate the probability; we just want to know whether it&#x27;s greater than zero.<p>As initially posed, the problem is, &quot;Out of all the possible distributions for A and B, and all the possible As and Bs for each distribution, is there a nonzero probability that B is further away from A than R (and in the same direction)?&quot; Intuition might tell you no, since the interval [A,B] is always finite over a seemingly infinite range. But that doesn&#x27;t account for the fact that &quot;most&quot; distributions are just as finite. And it&#x27;s also easy to envision that there are an infinite number of distributions that will permit a B that meets that condition (especially given that there are just as many Bs on &quot;that side&quot; of R as there are on &quot;this side&quot;). Still, you may argue that we don&#x27;t have an easy way to sum the probabilities over all the distributions.<p>So we solve the problem by re-framing it in simpler terms. Instead of fixing R while varying A and B, we transform the problem by fixing A and B and varying R (which is completely under our control). And it turns out, if our distribution of R is positive everywhere, then regardless of A and B, there&#x27;s a nonzero probability of R falling between them. We still need to sum over all possible distributions of A and B, but we&#x27;ve already shown that every term of the sum is positive.<p>In the end, we might not know the exact value of that probability, but that&#x27;s irrelevant to the problem.",1448888015

Consider a concrete question, like &quot;if I open the envelope and find $10, how confident would I need to be that it&#x27;s the low envelope before I switch?&quot;. In Bayesian terms that&#x27;s easy to answer, but with the frequentist version one is left asking &quot;how likely is it that my opponent used a distribution which when sampled once yielded $10, as opposed to a distribution which..&quot; or some such thing.<p>I mean, the envelopes puzzle basically says, &quot;you start out expecting two things to be equally likely, then you learn a piece of information, now how does that change your expectations?&quot; It&#x27;s as Bayesian a question as ever there was.",1448887949

For one, it&#x27;s very cheap to reach such exchanges for companies like Hetzner, because they usually operate their data centers on the same campus, to safe exactly on that backhaul cost to the exchange. By implication all the ISPs are expected to extend their network into these facilities to pick up traffic. While it&#x27;s true that some ISPs operate big POPs near exchanges, it&#x27;s not where their customers are. And both users and data center operators rightfully expect a professionally built network with redundancy etc. In that respect it&#x27;s not necessarily unfair that they charge for the traffic. (While it is certainly unfair that they don&#x27;t upgrade their connections to extort outrageous prices from other market participants and what&#x27;s much worse to contain internet growth on a large scale, which is why Germany is a fairly under-developed country in terms of internet connectivity).<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_...</a><p>But also, people who work for exchange point operators are the only ones left flying business class in the telecom industry.

Then it declines into &quot;cubical land&quot; where a local minima is probably the &quot;jeans friday&quot;.  Then the curve goes back up where there are strong labor markets (programmers in SV, former Apple CEOs who like turtlenecks, etc) and slovenly attire is a very public display of how difficult replacement would be.<p>Something else to keep in mind is the unemployment rate (the real labor force participation rate, not the made up propaganda figures) is about half.  And labor saving home appliances mean the half who are not working are no longer standing at a sink doing dishes or hand washing laundry.  And a minimal level of social transfer payments mean the unemployed have some money and therefore something to be seen doing.  In &quot;the bad old days&quot; the bums down by the river were not well dressed, but they were unseen.

Big majors won (until now).<p>Now as I said in my previous comment, I&#x27;m me too an indipendent &quot;artist&quot; sharing my music in a compromise between free/no-free after long struggle with myself.<p>So MusicBot is great if used by artists/listeners fully aware about intellectual rights of posted contents. Long story. Generally, unfortunately, this is not the common case (awareness). The big risk I see, is that malicious (or simply ignorant/naif) users could post famous music (not necessarly good music), protected by copyrights. Boring Issues alla involving actors!<p>If I&#x27;m not wrong, quickly reading your beautiful synthetic python code, you store music in your server (as a MongoDB blob). ins&#x27;t it ?<p>Smart. Superb I could say!<p>But a possible issue could be that you store music (possibly copyrighted) in your own server.<p>A possible workaround/proposal is to test your project, avoiding to store stuff in your server, but leaving digital contents in Telegram Servers! if I well remember, until now Telegram do not officially say when file will be purged after upload... Ok that&#x27;s a &quot;volatile contents&quot; solution. Just an idea, maybe always interesting for sort of &quot;auto-deleting&quot; sahring, as secret messages (but could be wrong).<p>Another approach, could be, again to do not store anything in your server, no file upload/download, but just manage links to external repositories/specilized websites. An example ? just share links to youtube.com contents; in that way you &quot;delgate&quot; all copyrights possible issues to youtube censors ;-)<p>BTW, I quickly tested MusicBot looking for an artst and title, I noted that search functionality could be developed to understand better what user are looking for, but this is not a criticism of your excellent work, just a feature for a future implementation!<p>Thank again for sharing MusicBot\nrespect\ngiorgio",1448886932

I think that the two are relative -- dressing casual for your location is doing something to distinguish yourself from the lazier crowd.<p>I also think that using lookbook models as examples of casual dress is going to be excessive outside of fashion hubs. Their clothes are tailored well, layered appropriately with appealing, seasonally appropriate color schemes -- outside of a well curated closet, these aren&#x27;t going to be looks that you&#x27;ll pull out every day. And if your wardrobe is well selected, you probably are dressing a little more than casually.<p>Also, I would say that skinny jeans are a pretty gender agnostic article of clothing now. And again, I think location comes into play. You&#x27;re going to see a disproportionate number of women wearing sundresses/skirts in the south etc. I do think that in larger cities this is much less of a thing.",1448886123

Not the usual game-bot.<p>BTW, I&#x27;m an &quot;indipendent music maker myself (<a href=""http://solyaris.altervista.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://solyaris.altervista.org</a>) and I debate since many years about copyright/copy-left realms. I unfortunately think your good idea, could be abused easly, as someone pointed out :( I&#x27;ll feedback you later in different comment about this hot specific point.<p>Anyway, I fully agree with you, when you say that:<p>>Telegram is amazing platform and I&#x27;m looking forward for their next moves.<p>Absolutely! I think Telegram  is moving really great designing the big picture &quot;communication&quot; architecture including:\n1- p2p chats\n2- groups & supergroups\n3- channels\n4- bots\n5- bots integration in groups and channels<p>In my  opinion this integration of bots INSIDE groups and channels (humans), open new services scenarios, not games! Instead service apps useful for people, in business/application scenarios A real revolution: integration of robots and humans services. I&#x27;m serious about it and my twitter microblog: www.twitter.com/solyarisoftware is about that. I wote some ideas about in my draft/raough doc here: <a href=""https://github.com/solyaris/BOTServer/blob/master/wiki/services.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/solyaris/BOTServer/blob/master/wiki/servi...</a><p>> I must admit, that the current generation of bots is quite dumb and we need to move towards natural languages and learning.<p>I fully agree!<p>> I also don&#x27;t think that bots are viable &quot;app platforms&quot;. Bots should either be interfaces to bigger services or stand alone smart assistants.<p>Yes, but: I feel nowadays visual-paradigma/web-interface based/mobile apps are in many cases poor in suppluing real services. I&#x27;m basically perplex regarding  nowadays glorification of (mobile) web interface as &quot;THE way&quot; (to communicate/to get services/make business). I feel instead that next generation(Telegram) bots could be instead a real revolution in man-machine interfaces for services apps: the (Telegram) chat as prevalent way to communicate for users (see very young people habits...). Now as a text-based chat, in a near future, I see phone-calls + video-calls as front-end (along with text-based chats).<p>What I mean,  and I think I agree with you, is that a possible very interesting world is build-up &quot;intelligent chatbots&quot; machine-learning enabled, astep forward nowadays dumb bots that responds to basic /commands or enabled by some finite state machine dialogs (my project now).<p>What do you think ?<p>respect\ngiorgio",1448885785

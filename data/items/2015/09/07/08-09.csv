Where it is established, on the basis of proof or circumstantial evidence as described in the two lists mentioned in Article 18(3), including the data referred to in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000, that an asylum seeker has irregularly crossed the border into a Member State by land, sea or air having come from a third country, the Member State thus entered shall be responsible for examining the application for asylum. This responsibility shall cease 12 months after the date on which the irregular border crossing took place.&quot;<p>Therefore the first state entered is responsible for the registration and then for the application for asylum.<p>And no, the Dublin regulation doesn&#x27;t state denial of freedom of movement. But they never had such. The Schengen law is only valid for members of the European Union. Everyone else has to get a visum. \nThey were legally not allowed to enter Hungary in the first place, why would they be allowed then to enter another state without getting asylum first?",1441616390

In my opinion, YC has positioned itself near its center of gravity by being a bit more ruthlessly efficient and a somewhat paradoxically a bit more humane.

A compromised machine is therefore dangerous. This is no different than getting root access on the local machine, as you can access your local ssh agent there as well.<p>However, with sshmux, the agent channel is not forwarded as a socket, but instead internally handled as the ssh channel it really is. This means that compromising the agent at sshmux requires arbitrary memory access, which is a considerably more difficult feat, and means that the machine is 100% compromised regardless.",1441615562

To be perfectly honest I&#x27;ve not noticed any significant pressure on my US colleagues and team to not take vacation days. If anything my own US based manager is frequently reminding everyone to plan their vacations and not leave too much of their allowance until the end of the year. So clearly this culture of not taking full vacation days isn&#x27;t ubiquitous, and of course the culture may be different in other parts of the bank - I work on the tech side. Maybe it&#x27;s partly because as a global organization the US side has absorbed some of the vacation culture from other regions.

People are being driven to extraordinarily dangerous actions, just to save their families. \nSo, I have an idea, it&#x27;s superbly fledgling, and really I don&#x27;t have any idea where to begin with it, never mind the skill set currently to implement it - hence why I&#x27;m reaching out to the HN community.  \nReporters go to great lengths to describe how many of the refugees are connected through their smartphones. So I figured, why not create an app, where individuals in communities refugees are congregating, who have room in their homes, could offer shelter and warmth to refugee families for a few nights could open their doors and be paired with somewhere people could stay. A mixture of coachsurfing and airbnb. The expectation would not be for someone to offer a house and &#x27;adopt a family&#x27; - merely to show someone warmth and welcoming vibes.\nThis is not a solution to the problem of war. Nor is it intended to be a permanent resolution to refugee families problems - it is merely an opportunity to help them feel human once again - to feel safe for a couple of nights and welcome. Often people such as refugees are left to feel sub-human, this would be a chance to integrate them.\nI lay no claim to this idea - if someone wishes to take the ball and run with it - fine. This is a problem bigger than any one person. It certainly would not be an idea run for profit however.\nIf you can help - reply here, or if you would like to be involved, drop an email to jmcclafe@gmail.com (not a real name - just an email set up for the sake of this project)\nHelp: \n- First, thoughts on the business - am I just being completely stupid?\n- How to navigate safety concerns about housing strangers?\n- How to develop an app?\n- Any help advertising/funding?",1441614446

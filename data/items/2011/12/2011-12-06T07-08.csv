Depending on the carrier it may be VoIP in the backbone part of the network, but the critical part over the air is circuit switched voice traffic. This changes with LTE, which is the first all IP wireless standard.<p>So what do you get with cellular voice that you don't get with VoIP over cellular data? For one thing, when a voice call is set up it will get guaranteed resources with a delay guarantee, so your call will not be dropped so easily and the number of lost and late packages is minimized. Also, when doing handover to a new cell tower you'll be prioritized to minimize dropped calls.<p>For LTE, the carriers will likely offer voice plans that have similar characteristics. So your VoIP traffic will be prioritized compared to normal data. If you run a normal VoIP client, you'll have the same prio as data traffic, which will give you more dropped calls, lower call quality due to dropped or late packets etc.<p>That's how the carriers can compete. Is it worth to pay extra for? That depends.

</code></pre>
During the second world war US wages were frozen. But there was an exception where you could provide employees with differing levels of health care. So that became a mechanism for competing for staff: it became common for companies to offer corporate health care at the same time that individual private health was dropping off because nobody had any money to afford it. This pushed the market towards group-based programs. After the war, public policy further cemented the patterns that had developed.<p>I understand that if you live in the US it's impractical to get private health insurance on an individual basis because there's low business in the space, meaning low competition, as well as the tax structures described by other commenters.<p><pre><code>    > My understanding is that health care is linked to

Paypal takes a cut of the merchant's revenues for virtually passing the money from the consumer to the merchant; therefore, the merchant is PayPal's customer, and the consumers the necessary evil.<p>Secondly, PayPal didn't simply say ""stop that"".  They gave him the runaround, froze unrelated accounts, and stonewalled him when he tried to make whatever accommodations would please them.  That they were rude and condescending during all of this only adds insult to injury.<p>""Don't ever use PayPal"" is really a reasonable reaction to these sorts of stories.  When a seemingly legitimate transaction can unexpectedly invite the fury of paypal's overzealous fraud protection drones, how could the reaction be anything but?",1323155940

It doesn't matter since it's still lock-based (albeit more efficient due to fewer system calls). My original point is, threading is still lock-based. <i>Replacing your lock-based code with queues eliminates many of the penalties associated with locks and also simplifies your remaining code. Instead of using a lock to protect a shared resource, you can instead create a queue to serialize the tasks that access that resource. Queues do not impose the same penalties as locks. For example, queueing a task does not require trapping into the kernel to acquire a mutex (or however mutex is implemented)</i>",1323155874

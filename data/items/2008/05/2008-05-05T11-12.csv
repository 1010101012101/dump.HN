But I don't like this ""company.gov"" idea if it gives the feds any regulatory power.<p>Currently, most corporate details are regulated by the states. In the article, it's mentioned that incorporation costs over $900 in cali. In NJ, it is much cheaper, and Delaware is particularly nice (YC does all it's paperwork through Delaware, no?).<p>If the feds get this kind of power, I'd be worried that the whole nation would look like California rather than like Delaware.",1209988752

There is none that I know of, other than the word ""design"".<p>My approach is to consciously absorb as much of the problem at hand as possible, then let my subconscious crunch on it for a while, the length of time depending on the complexity of the problem.  Coming up with the big concept for a large design, both building or software, can take a few days if its revolutionary, or a few minutes if its not.  The key is to have a process that helps you leverage the power of your subconscious.  Trying to force a solution in your conscious mind on a harder problem can be both painful and a waste of time.",1209988170

I write it mostly for myself and to polish my English ...""</i><p>I use my blog to 'try' and polish my ideas.<p>Funny things happen when you write them down. The ideas that sound great in your head suddenly appear trivial, less substantial. That's why working on them in blog format is a good idea. You get to throw ideas around for others to read, comment. Shred. Some work, others get shot down or in the process you find better ones. The ones that work can attract comment. This is where you can make improvements or just kill them.<p>Ideas can be polished far easier under the wear of others scrutiny.",1209987237

I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but ...<p>I used to be very optimistic (""global village"", etc) about the Internet, newsgroups, blogs, but now it seems that most of the time, communication drives people into irreconcilable factions. Too many people bring limited reading comprehension skills with them, and end up violently agreeing with each other or creating conflict for absolutely no reason. Most discussions seem to descend all too quickly into name-calling (""fanboy"", etc) and I personally fail to see the value in it.<p>The best blogs start with some simple questions: do I have anything of value to contribute? Am I an interesting person who has achieved something noteworthy? Do I have unique insights or am I just recycling the zeitgeist? For most bloggers, I suspect the answer to all those questions is ""no"", and (although they can keep going if they like) there's precious little reason to actually read them.",1209987092

181339,comment,180970,180970,0,0,ikerin,,,"Doesn't anyone remember, back in the day, when HTML was ""just fine"" and javascript was 'clunky', 'unusable', and had a multitude of accessability issues. Cross-browser javascript problems, anyone?
Now, of course flash also has its issues, but believe it or not, they are, much, much fewer and smaller than javascript/ajax had when it first started out, and even, dare i say, now.<p>The accessability issues, associated with flash are usually (as always) because the developer didn't know how to fix them, or didn't care to.  There simply hasn't been a ""killer app"" like gmail, to show all the world that it could do thing much better than is generally asumed.<p>For example did you know that you can make a flash site change it's url as you navigate through it, enabling you to link/bookmark a specific section or a page of it (also allowing you yo use back/forward buttons)? The accessability issues have also long been solved, giving 'no-flash' users a striped down, yet fully functional/accesible site (as is the idea of javascript behaviours, if I recall correctly). (Take a look at this site <a href=""http://www.rizn.bg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rizn.bg</a> for example of the two above - I know it's not english but the important thing is the concept)<p>And flash in itself has much more potential than javascript/ajax. 3D animations, build-in optimised compression algorithms, easier server integration, <i>video/audio streaming</i>, webcamera support, better file upload, etc, and  it's all build in, on a single platform, with a quite nice and consistent api on top of it. Actionscript (the flash language) is a quite nice blend of java and javascript, minus the java bloat, complete with classes, inheritence, true C-like data types (insane performance), clusures.  And it's all a lot more cross-browser friendly, than any other competing tehnology.<p>Now, i'm not suggesting we all jump in, because it does have issues still (font rendering, os integration and of caurse performance, to name a few) but there are quite a few places where it is a very good alternative. Just because most of the flash we come in contact with are useless splash screens and tacky animations, it doesn't mean that it can't do better. It's a hugely undervalued platform in my opinion, and we kinda have to 'wake up' and talk about its benefits instead of ""it'll never work, its better to stick to what you know"".<p>As for the original question - maybe because when it started out, flalsh was not good enough (pre flash 9 time), and by now they already have an infrastructure in place. Maybe if they create something radically new, they'll try to adopt flash, otherwise they'll stick with what works for them now.",1209985440

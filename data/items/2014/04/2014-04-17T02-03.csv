You couldn&#x27;t really bootstrap Twitter. Or most medical device companies.<p>I have a friend bootstrapping a company right now. He is growing organically, and is cash flow positive. He&#x27;ll likely be acquired in 4 years for about $20M. That&#x27;s awesome. But if he would have raised just $3M, he could have built his product in 18 months instead of 5 years.<p>In the end, he&#x27;ll have the satisfaction of having bootstrapped. But from a purely financial perspective, I think he would have been better off raising money and exiting (or being even more profitable) faster.",1397703555

7601813,comment,7601631,7601631,1,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"The general sentiment of bootstrap, get traction, get paying customers etc... is generally accepted by the vast majority of serious entrepreneurs, but I think the idea that moving forward you will be able to get to an MVP with no budget will become very difficult. This is largely because the projected technologies of the future will require much more up-front capability to even prove useful to a potential user than ever.<p>Doing anything useful or reliable with machine learning, computer vision, data processing, image processing, robotics, genetics or nanotechnology takes years of practice engineering and studying. Those are the frontiers 10 years from now and to think you could bootstrap a competitor to SIRI or QR reader etc... without already having a significant background in it is in my mind far fetched.<p>I would love to see this proven wrong with the creation of an API/framework/toolset that allows people with <5yrs in engineering to create such products.",1397703360

7601770,comment,7599765,7600498,1,0,quanticle,,,"I disagree quite strongly. In theory it works like you suggest - developers see problems, and they&#x27;re motivated to fix them in a permanent fashion so they won&#x27;t ever have to deal with them again. In practice, there are multiple equilibria. The good equilibrium is what you describe and what I&#x27;ve summarized above. The bad equilibrium is that the team is short staffed and developers are too busy putting out fires to actually implement the architectural changes required to prevent the fires from starting in the first place. If you&#x27;re building an organization where developers are expected to do operations work, you <i>have</i> to think about the latter case. If you don&#x27;t, you can very easily fall into a trap where your core infrastructure stagnates because developers are too busy coming up with the next hack to fix the ongoing outage to step back and think about broader changes that will make the entire system less painful in the future.<p>In fact, this is one of the things that Steve Yegge cites in his famous essay [0] about how Google, organizationally, is better than Amazon:<p><pre><code>    And their operations are a mess; they don&#x27;t really have SREs and they make \n    engineers pretty much do everything, which leaves almost no time for coding - \n    though again this varies by group, so it&#x27;s luck of the draw.\n</code></pre>\nAt a small company like Olark, they may be able to get away with this because their product is small, their team is small, and so by necessity they have to do everything. But once their product grows, or their customer volume grows, it&#x27;s very easy to get sucked into a very painful trap by having your engineers be your ops and your customer support.<p>[0] <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX</a>",1397702389

It lets you 1) mix and match pieces build to work with Backbone (ModelBinder for declarative model-view bindings, Relational for client-side relations, etc.), 2) scale state change management up and down as appropriate for your app (via model changes, controller interactions, route events), and does not force you into a fully single-page architecture if you don&#x27;t want it.<p>Anyway, I think Marionette is a pretty great way to write small, modular, readable code without sacrificing high-level abstractions.",1397701761

You want feature X (the ability to return multiple values) without having to either (a) pick apart a simple structure containing those values or (b) assign names to those values, letting the runtime system pick them apart (or never stick them together, its choice) for you.<p>I was actually aiming for (b) here, just incorporated directly into the normal function call and return syntax. Why shouldn&#x27;t you be able to return multiple values in registers or on a results stack without &quot;tupling them up&quot;? It&#x27;s clearly supported by the hardware. By &quot;call-values&quot; (sp) hack, I meant that needing to use &quot;call-with-values&quot; and &quot;values&quot; is the hack. Lua, for instance, lets you (with very clean syntax) return multiple values from a function, and assign the results to separate variables, during which at no point is an intermediate table constructed:<p><pre><code>  thing, err = getthing()\n  if thing == nil then print(err) return nil end\n  do_stuff(thing)\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t think I got it quite right with my angular brackets, but I was trying to think of a nice, clear syntax for multiple return values that wouldn&#x27;t look out of place in a Lisp.<p>Maybe I was being misleading by using an example that resembled option types. I wasn&#x27;t trying to bring static typing into this, though I am interested in static type systems and curious about static Lisps, it&#x27;s just that emulating simple option types for error handling purposes is a very common usage for multiple return values in dynamically typed languages (and, cough, static ones like Go that have lame type systems).<p>> data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a<p>> No matter what kind of cleverness you do in memory or whatever, in the end this type is a tuple of two values: (constructor, data).<p>Is that true? &quot;Maybe&quot; seems like the perfect candidate for a nullable pointer representation, or at least some kind of small tag.

It means that the user retains the right to the content they uploaded, and we don&#x27;t take exclusive rights on displaying it back to them. So they have full rights to upload/store/do whatever with it elsewhere.<p><i>worldwide</i>: These rights are not restricted to a specific country/zone, like the US, because our service operates and displays content around the world.<p><i>publicly perform, publicly display</i>: Users can generate public links to their files, so we have to cover the case where they post it publicly and let their content be publicly displayed via the link they created. Publicly display covers still work like images; publicly perform covers &quot;moving&quot; work like music and videos.<p><i>derivative works, copies</i>: Gives Streem access to make thumbnails/cover arts (derivative work) and copies of the data (redundant storage).<p><i>authorizing others to do so</i>: Lets Streem pass the content through different layers and service providers during the upload, processing, and when data is requested. For example, Streem has to pass the content through a CDN when the user accesses it, which this gives us the right to do.<p>The main thing that prevents Streem from abusing these policies is the &quot;for use in connection with the Service and Company’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business&quot; line. This ensures that we can only operate on the data to provide our service to the user when they authorize us to do so (i.e. if they click the &quot;Share&quot; button, they authorize us to operate on the file to enable it for sharing), and not for something like advertising the user&#x27;s content to generate money since they haven&#x27;t authorized us to do that (we&#x27;d have to add an opt-in &quot;Advertise this for me&quot; button or add it in to the TOS and appropriately notify everyone if we wanted to be malicious like that, which would be ridiculous for us).<p>Other cloud storage companies also have very similar TOS&#x27;s, although they&#x27;re more colloquial in their wording, so they may be easier to understand, but no different in the rights they&#x27;re asking for.<p>If you want a more credible source, take a look at Yishan Wong&#x27;s (CEO of Reddit) post: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1sndxe/weve_rewritten_our_user_agreement_come_check_it/cdzaf2a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1sndxe/weve_rewritten_...</a>",1397700290

2792071,comment,2789540,2791806,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"I am not arguing for a lynch mob but describing what a rational actor might do in a serious dispute with Cisco. In such a dispute there is no civil government to appeal to. Cisco has decided they wish to be treated as a sovereign power. So be it. That has great benefits, but also great risks: to paraphrase von Clausewitz, war is a mere continuation of litigation by other means.<p><i>And you would, validly, be deserving of the same retaliation by any children of the exec ...</i><p>And how would they do that, given that a rational actor would use difficult-to-trace asymmetrical warfare techniques?<p><i>... unconcerned with accuracy or the case of false positives ...</i><p>Collateral damage is one of the main considerations of the rational opponent theory. His rational counterparts in Cisco will understand that the corporate sovereign strategy has a ghastly risk of blowback and therefore act to stop it. Very few VPs are willing to be gunned down in front of their grandkids so that some dickhead in legal can get a bonus. Likewise for the neighbors, the company that supplies electricity to the corporate headquarters, the banks that settle their financial transactions, the garbage men, and so on. Nobody wants to be on the Death Star unless it is certified rebel proof.<p><i>... just as lame-brained as every single idiot that hit a car in the Vancouver riots.</i><p>Random violence is illegitimate, a synonym for saying it does not work. It has to be tit-for-tat. Talking about bombing some deli does not keep corporate states in line. What does work is talking about an exec's kids coming home from school to find daddy hanged from the ceiling by his own guts. And if talking does not do the trick, they will eventually victimize someone who strikes back.",1311299732

Icy Moons, James Webb, LISA -- real science, real discovery -- tends to get budget-axed to make more room for politically-savvy STS, ISS, Flags on Mars.<p>Icy Moons -- first substantial progress in space probes in decades, long-delayed trial of nuclear electric propulsion -- not important enough.

New frontiers in experiment capability: scanning mysterious moons with high-powered radars, spectrometers.

They generally rely entirely on other professors to edit their journals and conference proceedings, and for all the content.  They charge ridiculous rates - often thousands of dollars for a single annual journal subscription - and get away with it because the system is not prone to change.  Researchers are rewarded for publishing in ""the best"" journals, so no one wants to take the leap to publishing in a free space where there is currently much less prestige.<p>That's basically why academic publishing is messed up.  Because there's money to made in keeping it messed up, and money to be lost in fixing it.  But the ones who generate the real value _do_ want things to be as freely available as possible.  If a critical mass of top-tier researchers agreed to stop publishing in non-free journals and conferences, it would probably start a revolution in this area -- but that's a lot to ask.<p>It's a prisoner's dilemma, in that the ""traitor"" researchers who keep publishing in the old journals will be rewarded.<p>(This is all about academia -- I guess motivations may be different in industry-backed research.)",1311297672

We appreciate your input and interest in our company.</i><p><i>In the specific case you referenced, Cisco discovered what it believed to be theft of Cisco software by Mr Adekeye.  We brought civil claims against him and his company, and reported the matter to law enforcement, as we customarily do when we believe we have been a victim of theft. After nearly two years of independent investigation, the United States Secret Service issued a criminal complaint alleging that
Mr. Adekeye violated the United States Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 97 separate instances.  As a result, a United States District Court judge signed an arrest warrant for Mr. Adekeye.  The decision as to whether to prosecute any criminal matter must be made by governmental authorities, and not by any private citizen or company, and Cisco in no way controlled the bringing of criminal charges against Mr Adekeye, nor did we contact any other agency regarding the matter.</i><p><i>Separately, as part of the civil lawsuit, Cisco presented evidence that Mr. Adekeye repeatedly stole information and software from Cisco using a current employee's credentials to access Cisco's computer network.  The United States District Court for the Northern District of California agreed with Cisco, and ruled that Mr. Adekeye's conduct violated the U.S. federal anti-hacking statute.</i><p><i>The Canadian judge apparently objected to the fact that Mr. Adekeye was arrested by Canadian authorities during a civil justice proceeding. This is a matter between the US and Canadian governments, and we believe any person or entity concerned about theft of its property would have acted as we did.  We strenuously object to the judge's characterization of Cisco's actions, which was based on Mr. Adekeye's allegations in a proceeding in which we did not participate and in which we had no opportunity to present any information.</i><p><i>Again, thank you for your email.</i><p><i>Sincerely,</i><p><i>Mark Chandler</i><p><i>Senior Vice President, Legal Services, General Counsel and Secretary</i><p><i>Cisco Systems, Inc.</i>",1311296773

If it were my job to write articles about the situation I certainly wouldnt pick Greece Defaults as a headline. I would mention the default in the body and explain what that actually means. Context.

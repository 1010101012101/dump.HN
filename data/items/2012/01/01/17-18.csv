3413417,comment,3412643,3412643,0,0,mikeash,,,"I'm seeing a few common themes in comments, so I figure I'll address them all at once. I'm writing this comment both for my blog and Hacker News, so please excuse vagueness etc.<p>Beginning work without a contract was certainly not a smart move. They talked a good game but I still should have known better. However, I think I was still in a pretty good position, because it is that contract that gave them the right to use my work. I already had a reasonably popular technical blog that would have made a fine home for what I wrote if they had changed their minds.<p>In fact, this gave me quite a bit of leverage when it came time to get the Pro Objective-C contract amended. After they refused my amendments, I pointed out that they could not use my work without a contract, and that I would not sign anything that didn't have my amendments. They changed their tune with amusing rapidity.<p>The amendments I requested were fairly simple. Aside from fixing the dates, I struck out portions that required ongoing work from me, such as responding to errata, since I was no longer involved with the book.<p>The money involved was not large, for sure. In general, writing technical books doesn't pay well. There are good reasons to do it (exposure, fun, satisfaction, etc.) but money isn't one. I went into the project knowing that I wasn't doing it for the money. Given that, it might seem strange to have such a problem over money, but I don't think it is: even though I wasn't doing it for the money, I was still promised money, and I simply couldn't tolerate any crap over it.<p>For everyone talking about other publishers, I appreciate the sentiment, but I have moved into self-publishing. The Complete Friday Q&A is self-published and the experience was great. I intend to continue doing so in the future. I really don't see much of a role for traditional publishers these days.",1325440723

Is it because you are trying to save people from themselves?  Perhaps it's because you are concerned about what it might do to the dollar.  If that's your concern, is that not an admission that the dollar is fragile?<p>Is it wise to run the economy with the Federal Reserve as a single point of failure? We are suffering greatly from the failures of the Federal Reserve now. They will make mistakes in the future.<p>Edit because site will not let me comment on reply below:<p>The Federal Reserve failed us by stoking the housing boom with low interest rates.

3413393,comment,3412643,3413307,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Unfortunately the answer for your friend is simple: He got scammed. If a ""publisher"" asks you to pay for everything, or indeed for anything but postage, they are a scammer. There are entire message boards dedicated to authors warning other authors away from such scams; look e.g. for Absolute Write's ""Bewares"" section or google ""Yog's Law"" (""Money flows toward the writer."")<p>Paying for your own publication costs is called <i>vanity press publishing</i>, and it's okay provided you know what you're doing: You are almost certainly taking a big loss in order to get your work into paper form. You will only make money if you've got publishing talent, which equates to ""marketing talent"": You've got to be good at selling books, which is very hard, especially if you've never done it before.<p>(Before I got distracted by the story of your poor friend, I was going to answer: many do self-publish, more and more every day, but you don't notice them as often because they aren't as well promoted. Also, whereas it's fairly easy to market tech books online non-tech books are far harder to sell without market knowledge that publishers have scraped together over decades, non-techie writers therefore lust after contracts, and techies imitate non-techie writers. And, because getting a publishing contract probably increases the odds that your book will get finished, because someone else is pushing you toward completion, when we survey the universe of manuscripts we disproportionally sample the ones that get turned into finished books by publishers.)<p>(And, yes, e-readers are busily upending this centuries-old industry, so ask again in five years for a completely different answer.)",1325439748

Getting your car broken into in a major city is a relatively common experience.   Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death.<p>Your paranoia can be lumped into two categories -- minor inconveniences to you or threats with a very very low probability of happening.<p>I'm not trying to dismiss your paranoia.  I completely sympathize that the shady looking fellow can make anyone afraid, and the only ""cure"" is habituation and rationalization.    And you can't habituate if you're not a regular transit user.<p>On the other hand, one of the major problems with driving is habituation.   If you're not paying attention, it's quite easy to kill a family of four.   But people do it so often without having a problem that they let themselves get distracted.   That's when accidents happen.<p>Driver training really needs to be more like the firearms training I received as a kid.   Loaded firearms can be easily handled safely, but you always have to remember that they are deadly weapons and treat them with care and attention.   A multi-ton vehicle moving at velocities well in excess of those evolution trained us to deal with is also a deadly weapon.   Safe when used properly by yourself and everyone else on the roads, but always a deadly weapon.",1325437699
3413346,comment,3413116,3413116,0,0,jessriedel,,,"> In 2004, I.B.M. sold its PC business to Lenovo of China. Mr. Palmisano says he deflected overtures from Dell and private equity firms, preferring the sale to a company in China for strategic reasons: the Chinese government wants its corporations to expand globally, and by aiding that national goal, I.B.M. enhanced its stature in the lucrative Chinese market, where the government still steers business.<p>This doesn't surprise me, but I'm still blown away by this concept.  It's highly unlikely that Lenovo happened to offer the <i>same</i> amount as whoever else was the true highest bidder, so this was essentially a huge extortion payment from IBM to China.  The deal involved roughly $1 billion of assests, so it's not unreasonable to think that IBM paid of order $100 million to get into the Chinese government's good graces.",1325437673

I would guess that around 20 years or so ago, they stopped being primarily a technology company and shifted to offering services that were sold be a great sales force to keep customers hooked.",1325437516

About 20% of our technical hires in 2011 were people who came from HN.<p>I wondered about whether a similar post each month would be useful. I've been surprised in two ways: 1) The number of applicants has generally gone up each month, not down and 2) almost every month, one or two of the people responding say something like ""I've seen your post several times now and have been meaning to reply. Today, I finally decided to do it.""<p>I guess what I'm saying is that my experience with posting jobs to HN has been great, and posting (almost) the same content each month seems effective.",1325437247

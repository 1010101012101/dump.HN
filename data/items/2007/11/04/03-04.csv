I have been at Microsoft less than 3 years and haven't drank the Kool-Aid. However, I don't buy the Microsoft is evil argument either.<p>I rarely write about Microsoft. In fact I write about Google and lots of startups about 80% of the time. That said, if you want to disagree with my point of view anytime...that is fine. It is a free country.<p>Don ",1194148195

75951,comment,75776,75811,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Being an entrepreneur type (at least I like to think so), I can't stand working for someone else. I hate it, I absolutely can't stand to sell myself short, which is what I feel working or someone else is. That said, before I started reading PG's essays, I had no idea of the ""other option"". I hadn't even considered web startups or not working for someone else. I didn't even know what it was that bothered me about working for other people; I always just thought it was the ""daily grind"" getting old. Of course, I realize now that I just felt like I was getting all I could out of my abilities, like I (hopefully) could in a startup.<p>So while I may not have been ""looking forward"" to getting a job, that was all I ever considered. I think that may be true for a lot of people. Now, of course, I don't even consider it, except as a last resort. I can't even stand being tied to the work associated with my Fellowship (for grad school), and that is much more open-ended.<p>I guess my point is that advertising like this is definitely valuable. There are individuals out there like myself who have the drive and the talent and simply aren't aware of any opportunities outside of the status quo. Thank goodness I took that random Lisp course....",1194146696

I could/would definitely plan my career so that I had enough money to retire comfortably, which would require about $1.5 million.   I'm saying less than that just to be safe (and in case I really want to switch to a less lucrative/more fulfilling career). In reality, I think I'll make a lot more than $1.5 million, but it's a little too risky to bet on.<p>",1194145681

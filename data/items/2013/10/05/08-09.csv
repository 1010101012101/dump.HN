Most also don&#x27;t consider that immigrants should vote, and in the case of Switzerland that&#x27;s another 20 or 25%.<p>I&#x27;m obviously not saying that not allowing women to vote is good or anything, but that you can&#x27;t say a system is not &quot;purely&quot; democratic just because of full class of population doesn&#x27;t vote.

6500026,comment,6498878,6498984,9,0,Joeri,,,"Oberon was the programming language and environment used to teach first year programming classes at the university of antwerp when I studied there back in the late 90&#x27;s. I ended up using it as my main programming environment for months at a time. There was a definite learning curve because of the weird mouse approach. They used mouse behavior that I haven&#x27;t seen anywhere else, like interclicks (chorded mouse button click combinations). Mostly though there were keyboard alternatives, like ctrl-enter for middle click, so you didn&#x27;t have to have the mouse in hand all the time. Once the learning curve was over I remember finding the keyboard/mouse behavior quite efficient, though you did need a three-button mouse to make full use of it.<p>I initially had a negative reaction to the clunky appearance of oberon and the weird conventions, but grew to like it quite a bit over the course of the year. It was really a programmer&#x27;s OS, because there was essentially no difference between documents, programs and user interfaces. You could look at any application and decompose it into its building blocks and program code quite easily because &quot;view source&quot; was an intrinsic part of the system. The downside was that it didn&#x27;t actually <i>do</i> much, given that there was basically no way to port existing software so it ran inside the oberon environment. Had it somehow gained the ability to run other programming languages than Oberon within the same UI paradigm it might have been quite popular as a geek OS.",1380962831

Imagine you work hard and only get enough to live on the edge. Now imagine you&#x27;re not even the average joe, but feel that you could really change things on the world. You haven&#x27;t to be a genius in order to do that, but you need to be creative, innovative and willing to work without the command to work. Now let&#x27;s get an eagle&#x27;s perspective on what would happen, if encouraged people would not have to spent their entire lives working for the bare minimum that keeps them slaves of the economy and industry.<p>You would essentially create the startup-country #1. Everybody could now cherish their dreams again and make them real. You don&#x27;t believe it right, that&#x27;s &quot;stupid eastern communism thinkblarg&quot;, right? How comes you Sir, Madam believe in Kickstarter, Crowdfunding, Bitcoin, P2P, Wikipedia.. and the individual freedom, so to say the american dream, when you actually have to rely on the mercy of the rich and your leading political party? Isn&#x27;t that a wet dream reserverd for the 1:100.000? Let&#x27;s chill and put into retrospect on what would happen if you were getting a salary that allowed you to get your basics needs fulfilled. You would be less sick, stressed, worn out. You would now be able to do what you always wanted to do in your life. Hey admit it, you wanted to buy a house at some time and have a wife and children and you knew that you&#x27;d have to work hard, the half of your life to get there. Believe it or not, but giving people freedom doesn&#x27;t mean blindly trusting them. You are only one and the community you live in that government that likes to keep you locked into boundaries called country, consist of many of the smartest people on the world. Why not let them free, who do you trust if not them?\nWe&#x27;re far from a Star Trek world, where anybody get&#x27;s free access to medicine and any food or resource he needs.<p>Dear patriots, don&#x27;t be afraid that your Governments managed it to go bankrupt, they&#x27;ve managed that already and not for the first time. It&#x27;s time you your friends, families understand that the people you thought were the cause, aren&#x27;t the cause. It&#x27;s your Government stupid. I don&#x27;t say hate Governments, but do you blindly trust a complete stranger to care for your baby? Certainly not.<p>For those who&#x27;re not still convinced that an unconditional income is a good idea:<p>Why do you blindly trust your Government word-by-word to judge on your and everbody else&#x27;s life&#x27;s? When these people cannot even cooperate with just a few hundred other politicians? You see how wrong it is to not trust all people, but a selected few.

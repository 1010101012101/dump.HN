5872549,comment,5872348,5872526,22,0,dietrichepp,,,"Just because it is public knowledge doesn&#x27;t mean that the government can use the information to prosecute.<p>Suppose Alice and Bob are talking about a big drug deal over the phone, and Carol (working for the NSA) listens in.  Carol lets her friend Dan know, and Dan&#x27;s a police officer so he goes on a stakeout and catch Alice and Bob in the act, with $1M of cocaine in the trunk of Alice&#x27;s car, and $1M of cash in the trunk of Bob&#x27;s car.  Open and shut case, right?<p>US case law states that the cocaine is &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot;, because the cocaine would never have been discovered by the police if it weren&#x27;t for the illegal wiretap.  Therefore it is inadmissible as evidence.  The prosecution&#x27;s case is sunk, and Alice and Bob go free.  (Note that Dan never committed any crimes, might not be aware of the wiretap, and got good, hard, physical evidence that Alice and Bob were breaking the law.)<p>So if the government tries to use an illegal wiretap in an actual criminal case, it will probably do the prosecution more harm than good.  Best chance for a conviction is to pretend the wiretaps never happened.<p>Edit: I think a good example here is &quot;Nardone et al. v. United States.&quot;  In this case, Nardone was convicted of smuggling alcohol etc. during a first trial based primarily on evidence acquired through illegal wiretaps.  This conviction was overturned because the wiretaps were not admissible as evidence.  On the second trial, Nardone was convicted again on other evidence.  This conviction was also overturned, because the prosecutors wouldn&#x27;t have had this evidence if it weren&#x27;t for the wiretaps.",1371103154

5872500,comment,5872002,5872320,1,0,ihm,,,"1. There is probably no faithful grade-school language explanation. Monads are generally the composite of a left adjoint functor followed by its right adjoint. Adjoint functor pairs often consist of a free and a forgetful functor. A forgetful functor maps objects from some category to similar objects with less structure. E.g., groups to their underlying sets, abelian groups to groups, groups to monoids, etc.<p>A free functor gives objects with less structure the &quot;minimum possible&quot; stuff needed to be an object with more structure. Importantly it doesn&#x27;t assume anything about the simpler object. That is, the free construction should work in the same way for all objects of the same kind. For example, we might want to construct the &quot;free monoid&quot; from a set. A monoid has an associative binary operation and an identity element. The most natural way to make a monoid out of the set is by making the elements of the monoid strings of elements of the set, with string concatenation as the operation and the empty string as the identity element.<p>Composing a free functor with a forgetful functor means we&#x27;re taking some object, giving it some generic properties, and then &quot;forgetting&quot; what kind of properties it was given. Forgetting is in scare quotes here because a lot of the information about what these properties are like is captured in two natural transformations, `return&#x27; and `join&#x27;. (I won&#x27;t attempt to explain what those are. If you have some experience with functional languages, they&#x27;re a lot like polymorphic functions. E.g., a function that takes a type `A&#x27; to the type `List A&#x27;.)<p>Say F is a free functor and G is a forgetful functor. T = G . F is a monad. For some object X in our less-structured category, `return&#x27; expresses a correspondence between X and T X. `join&#x27; expresses a correspondence between `T (T X)&#x27; and `T X&#x27; (the basic idea here being that adding free structure twice is similar to adding it once). This is obviously a pretty incomplete (and judging from your request, too mathematical) treatment, but there is no such thing as a faithful non-mathematical treatment of monads. They are mathematical objects.<p>One neat things about monads in practice is that they&#x27;re typically pretty useful. Go out and find an arbitrary adjunction, and it&#x27;s likely that it leads to a useful and/or interesting monad. One fun one is (s,-) and (s ->) which leads to the state monad.<p>2. You can&#x27;t really express monads in C and C++. The necessary constructs to talk about these mathematical objects are just not there.<p>3. If you use Haskell regularly, you&#x27;ll use them all the time, even outside of your class. They are a useful way of doing things like passing around state or expressing safe exceptions. I doubt Google would ever ask you about something like monads in an interview.<p>Sorry I can&#x27;t give you a better idea. The best way to learn about monads is to use them and study the relevant category theory.",1371101924

I am not a mathematician, though, nor a hardcore Haskeller. But maybe that&#x27;s good enough. Let&#x27;s see.<p>A Monad is typically a parametric datatype which stores a value with some context. (A &quot;parametric datatype&quot; is just a concise way of describing something like scoped_ptr<Foo>.)<p>An example would be Maybe. A Maybe is a parametric type, much like your scoped_ptr<>. An example would be Maybe Int.<p>A Maybe Int can be one of two things: Nothing, or Just x, where x is any Integer. Examples: Just 2, Just -8, Just 0.<p>Monads support two functions: bind and return. Maybe is no exception to this.<p>Return (unfortunate name) puts a value inside a monad, in a minimal context. So if you apply &quot;return&quot; to the number 6, you get Just 6.<p>Notice that unless you implement your own arithmetic routines, you can&#x27;t (hand-wave) use operations like + or - on a Maybe Int. This is what the second operation, bind, is for.<p>Bind applies a function to the value inside the monad, with the stipulation that the function in question itself results in a monad. (Hold on to that thought.)<p>Bind is what you&#x27;d use to add (e.g.) 3 to Just 6, or how we&#x27;d divide Just 9 by 3.<p>Why would Nothing be useful? Well, in this dumb example, you might want to implement a division operator. So what if you have Just 0 and attempts to divide it by 3? Well, since Nothing is a valid value for Maybe Int, you could just return that instead of throwing an exception.<p>By convention many functions which can result in a failed computation return nothing. So a key lookup in a map, for instance, will return Maybe MyVal. It&#x27;s incumbent on the caller to check for whether it&#x27;s an instance of Nothing or Just MyVal; there&#x27;s no &quot;null&quot; in the picture. (I&#x27;m hand-waving here; there&#x27;s a ton of syntactic stuff in Haskell to make this very simple.)<p>I&#x27;m not going to talk about function composition, except to say that Bind lends itself well to that; you can bind multiple items expecting such as a Maybe Int in a row, since a stipulation of bind is the result has to be a monad.<p>2) They&#x27;re probably doable in C++ with template magic, but I would never ask someone to subject themselves to that.<p>3) You won&#x27;t necessarily <i>use</i> them but they are a useful concept to have in mind. Maybe itself crops up in such as Scala or other places, as an Option type.<p>It&#x27;s conceivable that instead of returning null/None or the moral equivalent you design your classes such that nobody returns null. Instead you might return an empty Person class. Calls on it which do nothing could be a no-op instead of crashing the program, or what have you; you can define what behavior you want to occur rather than a crash/stack trace.<p>I probably didn&#x27;t do a good job explaining this but I hope it helps. I tried to define monads in a more operational way rather than explaining the theory, which I myself can&#x27;t explain in a systematic or comprehensive way.",1371100399

From what I understand there is a huge emphasis on obligations to others, perfection, and the shame of failure. Traditional Japanese culture frowns on entrepreneurship, preferring obligation to a large corporation (who is in turn loyal to you), where it can sometimes be hard being so disconnected from the value you provide to society.<p>Most of hacker news will be lucky in this regard.

6461591,comment,6458360,6461541,4,0,tikhonj,,,"Haskell, fundamentally, is actually quite simple: it&#x27;s just the lambda calculus. You could fit the typing rules on a single piece of paper, and the evaluation rules are even more trivial. It is very difficult to come up with a simpler model than the lambda calculus.<p>Sure, it might be <i>difficult</i> to learn, but that&#x27;s very different from being <i>complex</i>. Haskell is, if anything, <i>different</i>--but this is also why it&#x27;s so much more expressive! I think this is a great example of Rich Hickey&#x27;s distinction between simple and easy. Also, learning a language to some level of proficiency is an O(1) cost but the benefit is O(n) to how much you use it, so I really don&#x27;t think you should consider that much.<p>Avoiding a language because it seems difficult to learn is just shortsighted.<p>Now, Haskell does have some complexity that other languages don&#x27;t. But this is mostly in the compiler and runtime system: things like the incredible parallelism and concurrency features. There are languages that have <i>much</i> simpler runtimes, but Clojure ain&#x27;t it: the JVM is probably the most complex existing runtime, full stop.<p>Legacy code, also, is more a matter of being on the JVM than language design. If you have a bunch of legacy code in C, it&#x27;ll fit better with Haskell than Clojure. Calling out to native programs from the JVM is a real pain. The Haskell FFI, on the other hand, is relatively nice.<p>More generally, I think the idea that every bit of power has a price is not accurate. I agree that language design is going to be a complex optimization problem against several axes. However, this does <i>not</i> mean every improvement along one carries a cost along another--not every language is along the Pareto frontier! Since all languages are imperfect, you <i>can</i> get strict wins.<p>Also, as I understand it, protocols do the <i>easy</i> part I talked about. Certainly useful, but not very interesting. I do not see how you would accomplish return type polymorphism in Clojure--something like the from_string function or polymorphic numeric literals--because the information needed is simply not there. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible, but I&#x27;ve certainly never seen it done.",1380369043

6461580,comment,6459915,6460231,1,0,kiddz,,,"I have rented up to four apartments at a time on AirBnB in both DC and LA.  Also I advised a good friend of mine, GSB grad and former investment banker, on how to use AirBnB so he could pursue a comedy career in NYC.<p>From my experience, if you are renting apts to put them on AirBnB, you seek out low cost apts where you a guaranteed a return.  I don&#x27;t think that apt pricing overall increases by this behavior, because as a sub-letter (unlike if you are paying a mortgage), you are looking for monthly positive cash flow because you don&#x27;t get the real estate appreciation.<p>For the last three years, I just look for studios and small one-bedrooms that if rented for 12 or less nights covers the rent.  So in DC, I&#x27;d never rent a $2000 month place for AirBnB because that would require me to rent out the place 15 nights a month just to break=even.  Too much risk.  But a studio at $1200 a month starts to make a lot of sense.  Yet, I would not want to personally live in a studio.<p>So I don&#x27;t think AirBnB leads to increases in overall rents.  It does lead to winnowing of small cheap well located apartments though, that you would otherwise move from but now you have a great opportunity to hold onto and put on AirBnB indefinitely. Oh, and if you really get into AirBnB, it can really affect your relationship with your gf/bf . . . let me crash at their place for three nights so I can make this $450 :)  But that&#x27;s another story.",1380368619

6461565,comment,6460761,6461530,4,0,beloch,,,"Publicly funded research typically focuses on curiosity driven, high-risk, long-term research that doesn&#x27;t have very good odds of ever producing a viable commercial product. Private enterprise focuses on short-term, low-risk research and engineering, packaging, marketing, etc. to bring safe-bets to market. For every big-pharma dollar spent to produce a new drug, ten government dollars were probably spent to get the underlying science to the point where pharmacorps were willing to touch it, and a hundred dollars more of government funding probably went off on various other tangents that turned out to be dead-ends.<p>On the other hand, academics often suck at commercializing their research. Bringing a drug to market involves many years of careful study and clinical trials that are utterly boring to most researchers in academia. You can&#x27;t get journal publications out of your twentieth double-blind study looking for side-effects!  Big pharma companies do perform a valuable service, but the rewards they receive are out of proportion. Multiple decades of monopoly are an unreasonable reward for performing this last step in development, especially when a lot of drug patents are the result of meaningless changes to existing products that are made solely to restart the monopoly clock!<p>Taking academic research and turning it into a commercial product does take time and money, and without patents this crucial last-step might not be adequately incentivised.  However,  If corporations want exclusive rights to commercialize publicly funded research, perhaps the public deserves a cut.  Perhaps Pfizer, etc. should be on the hook to help fund some of the taxpayer funded research they benefit from. Either that, or some alternative way to fund commercialization of academic research needs to be found.",1380367958

And for what?<p>Forget about a static type system in particular: every bit of power you get from a language has a price. Sometimes the cost is performance and sometimes  and this is often a much higher cost  language complexity.<p>When choosing a programming language, you should not aim for the most powerful language, but for the one that gives you the power you need for a price you&#x27;re willing to pay. Clojure strikes a pretty remarkable balance: a lot of power at a very low price (it&#x27;s very simple, very easy to learn, integrates extremely well with legacy code, and can give you great performance when you need it). It is arguable whether Haskell gives you more power, but even assuming it does, this power comes at a much higher cost. Haskell is not easy to learn, and it&#x27;s not simple to integrate with legacy code. The right question, I think, is how much are you willing to pay for extra power? Is extra power worth it?",1380366813

Traditional gamepads aren&#x27;t just a little bit worse than mice for FPS&#x27;s. They&#x27;re utter <i>shit</i>. You have to completely rebalance a FPS for gamepad users because they&#x27;re so clumsy compared to a mouse&keyboard user.  Still, gamepads are ergonomically fantastic for what they&#x27;re designed for.  Sitting on a couch, surrounded by buddies, they can&#x27;t be beat for comfort and compactness.<p>Trackpads are a lot better than gamepads for precision control, but they&#x27;re still inferior to mice. This is no surprise.  A mouse is centered around a single (okay, sometimes two) point(s) of laser-powered high-precision optical sensing. A trackpad is a giant array of sensors that are trying to approximate your intent from where the center of a mushy blob of flesh is mashed up against it applying pressure.  Multi-touch gesture commands can help compensate for this in many applications, but a FPS really demands a single, focused, high-quality stream of user input, and the mouse is still god, emperor, and <i>king</i> when it comes to that!<p>This steam controller is intermediate between a joystick and a mouse, and Valve is being honest about it.  It&#x27;s not going to be as precise as a mouse, but it promises to be better than a joystick. Yeah, that sounds wishy-washy, but only until you consider just how long the joystick has been with us. We&#x27;re talking about a method of input that hearkens back to the first automobiles ever built. It&#x27;s a big honking lever for applying force to a mechanical steering apparatus! The joystick was not birthed out of the need for precision input, but rather, out of the necessity to amplify human strength. This controller, albeit an obvious evolution once you&#x27;ve seen it, is <i>genius</i>. If Valve succeeds in delivering it, all existing gamepads will be rendered obsolete. I don&#x27;t know if the steambox will succeed because of this, but I know I&#x27;d rather use one of these than the XBox360 controller I (very) occasionally dust off to play console titles that have been (incompetently) ported to the PC!<p>Even if the steambox is an utter failure, I think this controller will be a runaway success.  I know Gabe has a huge grudge against Microsoft over their app store, but both MS and Valve could benefit if steambox controller support was baked into the Xbox One. Ditto for Sony and the PS4. This controller could change the course of the console wars.",1380366705

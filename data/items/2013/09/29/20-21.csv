Lodsys was allowed to unilaterally settle.</i><p>There&#x27;s no such thing as a unilateral settlement in a lawsuit; both the plaintiff and the defendant in question must agree, otherwise there&#x27;s no settlement. (Exception: A plaintiff can unilaterally dismiss its lawsuit against one or more defendants, without prejudice, but only if it does so before the defendant in question files an answer or motion for summary judgment.)<p>My guess -- unencumbered by any knowledge of the case -- is that Lodsys made a generous settlement offer to its defendants so that the case would become moot, in the hope that this would cut the ground out from under Apple&#x27;s motion. If that was Lodsys&#x27;s intent, it seems to have worked -- for now. From what I can tell from the report, there&#x27;d be nothing nefarious about a strategic withdrawal of that kind.",1380488294

6466484,comment,6440362,6463968,1,0,adamlett,,,"You seem to be arguing against points I did not make. I did not argue against copyright. I pay for both Netflix, HBO Nordic and Spotify subscriptions. I used to be a paying member of Last.fm when it was available in my country. I have a paid subscription to Ars Technica, I subscribe to a printed newspaper, I pay the mandatory public broadcast license and I regularly pay for books and apps. Is that what you call my abusive relationship with authors and artists?<p>The point that I keep restating is simply that nobody who produces anything, tangible or intangible, can expect to get paid a priori. After you&#x27;ve produced something, you have to also have to sell it to get paid. Consumer&#x27;s have a right to not buy, and if they don&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t get paid. Simple as that. Your talk about big sticks and the law is missing the point.<p>In places like the music industry that used to be a license to print money (80s and early 90s), it&#x27;s easy to understand why there seemed to arise the idea that there was in fact such a thing as &quot;the right to get paid&quot;. And that it was that right that was infringed upon when suddenly they lost the competition for the consumer&#x27;s entertainment dollar.<p>You like they were, seem to be fixated on piracy as the cause, but that is missing the forrest for trees. The internet was what happened, the cause of the disruption of the music industry. The internet is also what is happening to print media these days, and soon will happen to cable tv. These businesses don&#x27;t have a right to get paid either.",1380488094

So yes, on average Texans are among the most devout Christians and among the worst educated in the United States. There are more than enough public statistics to back this up.<p>In response to your libel statement, while I respect your background, that is entirely not the point.<p>It&#x27;s actually exactly the response I would expect from someone or a group who are involved in nefarious acts and are being called out on it. Rather than addressing the accusation and presenting evidence to the contrary, they seek to attack and silence the investigator by throwing out accusations of libel. It&#x27;s a tactic of snakes.<p>Unless I am seriously misunderstanding what happened here, which is possible, there was no mutual settlement here. Lodsys was allowed to unilaterally settle. Most of Apple&#x27;s arguments were just ignored. Quoting from the article,<p>&quot;The East Texas judge overseeing Lodsys&#x27; systematic patent attack on app developers has refused to even consider Apple&#x27;s motion. Instead, he allowed the patent-holding company to settle all its casesand then dismissed Apple&#x27;s motion as moot. By doing so, US District Judge Rodney Gilstrapwho has inherited the patent-happy East Texas court that once belonged to patent-troll favorite T. John Wardhas enabled Lodsys to threaten developers for months, and perhaps even years, to come.&quot;<p>This is why I stand by my question of corruption. Another commenter posted about no one finding corruption out of normal bounds. At least someone has been looking into it. But when you smell smoke, something&#x27;s burning. These cases keep getting the same rulings over and over, in one area of the country, by the same judges, in an area of business that is essentially parasitic and damaging to the very nature of my industry.

Hell, there&#x27;s a significant contingent belonging to the Tea Party who think the Republicans <i>don&#x27;t go far enough</i>. They were significant enough to elect a Tea Party representative to the <i>U.S. Senate.</i> That&#x27;s <i>mental</i>.

6466473,comment,6465880,6466341,6,0,alexqgb,,,"Relax. When it comes the discussion of corrupt public officials, the bar is much lower than it is with private individuals. Since trust in the system is so important, even the appearance of corruption can be as open to criticism as corruption itself, which is obviously harder to demonstrate. Simply tolerating the possibility of abuse invites distrust, making those who tolerate it reasonable targets for sharp skepticism (e.g. the NSA).<p>Of course, government is shot through with conflicts, both obvious and hidden. And people getting criticized for these ignore them and the criticism routinely. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that you don&#x27;t have to know something is rotten to speak up.

The interesting question now: is Bitcoin <i>sui generis</i> (like say TCP/IP, and further cemented in place by network effects) or the harbinger of many similar systems (like say Napster/Gnutella)?<p>A lot of people were deterred from trying things in this sphere because of a (flawed) conventional wisdom that there was no room for success  that various academic attacks would be fatal, and social/institutional barriers too strong. But now that Bitcoin shows that an ugly &quot;Minimum Viable Cryptocurrency&quot; with the right balances/incentives can take off, we&#x27;re already seeing lots of new interest and experiments.<p>I strongly expect some of these will discover new workable tradeoffs, in some cases even better than Bitcoin&#x27;s brilliant+lucky mix, that will then either coexist with Bitcoin in overlapping domains, or feed into the evolution of &#x27;Bitcoin Prime&#x27;.

6466300,comment,6463011,6464897,4,0,dlitz,,,"> There&#x27;s no inherent, fundamental reason in the universe other than momentum that says you&#x27;ve got to use an 8-bit encoding.<p>&quot;Other than momentum&quot;?  That&#x27;s a double-standard: Momentum is the only reason why UTF-16 is still relevant today.  Ignoring momentum, UTF-8 still has a bunch of advantages over UTF-16, namely that endianness isn&#x27;t an issue, it&#x27;s self-synchronizing over byte-oriented communication channels, and it&#x27;s more likely to be implemented correctly (bugs related to variable-length encoding are much less likely to get shipped to users, because they start to occur as soon as you step outside the ASCII range, rather than only once you get outside the BMP).  What advantages does UTF-16 have, ignoring momentum?<p>The comparison between UTF-8 and UTF-16 is adequately addressed here: <a href=""http://www.utf8everywhere.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.utf8everywhere.org/</a><p>I don&#x27;t want to debate abstract philosophy with you, anyway.  Momentum may be the reason, but there&#x27;s no plausible way that UTF-16 is ever going to replace octet-oriented text.  The idea that UTF-8 and UTF-16 are equivalent in practice is a complete fantasy, and I&#x27;m arguing that we should pick one, rather than always having to manage multiple encodings.<p>> I thought we software types are supposed to be big on abstractions and coming up with clever ways of managing complexity?<p>The best way to manage complexity is usually to adopt practices that tend to eliminate it over time, rather than adding more complexity in an attempt to hide previous complexity.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how &quot;clever&quot; that sounds, but it&#x27;s generally accepted that it takes more skill and effort to make things simpler than it does to make them more complex.<p>> It seems rather rigid to say you&#x27;ll only ever deal with one text encoding.<p>It seems rather rigid to say you&#x27;ll only ever deal with two&#x27;s-complement signed integer encoding.\nIt seems rather rigid to say you&#x27;ll only ever deal with IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic.\nIt seems rather rigid to say you&#x27;ll only ever deal with 8-bit bytes.\nIt seems rather rigid to say you&#x27;ll only ever deal with big-endian encoding on the network.\nIt seems rather rigid to say you&#x27;ll only ever deal with little-endian encoding in CPUs.\nIt seems rather rigid to say you&#x27;ll only ever deal with TCP/IP.<p>Why <i>not</i> eventually only ever deal with one text encoding?  There&#x27;s no inherent value in paying engineers to spend their time thinking about multiple text encodings, everywhere, forever.<p>Remember that we&#x27;re talking about the primary interfaces for exchanging text between software components.  Sure, there are occasions where someone needs to deal with other representations, but the smart thing to do is to pick a standard representation and move the conversion/negotiation stuff into libraries that only need to be used by the people who need them.  This allows the rest of us to quit paying for the unnecessary complexity, and incentivizes people to move toward the standard representation if their need for backward compatibility doesn&#x27;t outweigh the cost of actually maintaining it.<p>> I am pretty sure every Unix-like system I have set up gave me Latin1 by default, even quite recently.<p>Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora all default to UTF-8, and have for several years now.  You&#x27;re going to have to name names, or I&#x27;m going to assume that you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>> I think you are underestimating the extent to which UTF-8 is a crude hack designed to avoid rewriting ancient C programs that did very much the wrong approach to localization.<p>Really?  How would you have done it so that UTF-16 wouldn&#x27;t have broken your program?  Encode all text strings as length-prefixed binary data, even inside text files?  It&#x27;s ironic that you say it&#x27;s immature to call UTF-16 &quot;wrong&quot;, but you&#x27;ve basically just claimed that structured text in general is &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that nearly every important pre-Unicode text representation was at least partly compatible with ASCII: ISO-8859-* & EUC-CN were explicitly ASCII supersets, Shift-JIS & Big5 aren&#x27;t but still preserve 0x00-0x3F, and even EBCDIC, NUL is still NUL.  Absent an actual spec, it was no less reasonable to expect that an international text encoding would be ASCII-compatible than it was to expect that such a spec would break compatibility with <i>erverything</i>.  Trying to anticipate the latter would rightly have been called out as overengineering, anyway.<p>In that environment, writing a CSV or HTML parser that handles a minimal number of special characters and is otherwise 8-bit clean is exactly the right approach to localization.<p>Also, &quot;ancient C programs&quot;?  Seriously?  Are you really saying that C and its calling convention were/are irrelevant?<p>> There was a time before UTF-8 existed and became popular when it was a fairly common viewpoint that proper Unicode support involved making a clean break with the old char type.<p>Sure, and it was a fairly common viewpoint that OSI was the right approach, and that MD5 was collision-resistant.  Then, we learned that all of these viewpoints turned out to be wrong, and they were supplanted by better ideas.  UTF-8 became popular because it worked better than trying to &quot;redefine ALL the chars&quot;.<p>> You are right to say that UTF-8 &quot;won&quot; in most places but the fact that the NT kernel or the JVM use 16-bit chars reflects that prior history.<p>The JVM isn&#x27;t comparable, because its internal representation is invisible to Java developers.  I can write Java code without ever thinking about UTF-16, and a new version of the JVM could come out that changed the internal representation, and it wouldn&#x27;t affect me.  Python used a similar internal representation, and recently <i>did</i> change its internal representation.  Most Python developers won&#x27;t even notice.<p>If NT used UTF-16 internally, but provided a UTF-8 system call interface, I wouldn&#x27;t care.  The problem is that, in 2013, people writing brand new code on Windows still have to concern themselves with UTF-16 vs ANSI vs UTF-8.  This is a pattern of behavior at Microsoft, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m criticizing.<p>> I think a more mature attitude would be to accept this, that it came from a time and a place and is a different way of working, rather than call it &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>Look, I understand that mistakes will be made.  My criticism isn&#x27;t that the mistakes are made in the first place, but that Microsoft doesn&#x27;t appear to have any plan to <i>ever</i> rectify them.  The result is a consistent increase in friction over time, the cost of which is mostly paid for by entities other than Microsoft.<p>One could argue that Microsoft&#x27;s failure to manage complexity in this way is one of the reasons why Linux is eating their lunch in the server market.  Anecdotally, it&#x27;s just way easier to build stuff on top of Linux, because there&#x27;s a culture of eliminating old cruft---or at least moving it around so that only the people who want it end up paying for it.<p>As for your ad hominem arguments about &quot;attitude&quot; and &quot;maturity&quot;, I could do without them, thanks.  They contribute nothing to the conversation, and only serve to undermine your credibility.  Knock it off.",1380484817

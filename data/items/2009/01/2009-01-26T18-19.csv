How hard is it to make minimum payments on a few credit cards?  A hundred a month?  Credit cards have terms that allow borrowers to just keep going.  Typically, it means that people end up paying way more than they should, but in this case it also means that they're unlikely to default.<p>Plus, what are credit card bills as a percentage of one's budget?  Usually a much lower percentage than housing.  So, it would be easier to pay credit card bills than mortgage bills even if they were to be on the same terms.<p>The level of credit card debt is very worrisome and I hope people reevaluate that situation, but I don't think we're going to see massive default rates simply because the way that credit card agreements are structured allows the borrower to make very low monthly payments for a long time rather than creating a confrontation that could lead to default (as mortgages do).",1232994404

But towards the end even with a live in girlfriend I still got a little depressed.<p>The problem is mostly assuredly the lack of human contact. Not physically seeing people every day got to be a little rough. I'd force myself to go out on weekends and be social but it still felt fake.<p>The other big problem was that since I lived in the PNW and winter was setting in. It would be dark when I got up, and dark when I shut down for the day. This mean I never really saw the sunshine. I wouldn't really leave my house for days at a time. This got to be an issue. I felt trapped, even worse than that corp job I took while in college.<p>Now I live in San Francisco. The startup I work for has an office. I see sun almost every day. Hell I walk 2 miles to and then 2 miles from work every day. Its great! I think the human contact combined with the daily walk has increased both my energy level and my moral.<p>As a caveat to this. I still prefer to work from home at least one day a week. As the break from the daily in office distractions (meetings, troubleshooting, lunch, etc..) is nice.<p>So I think proper life balance is in order when working from home. If almost a daily regiment that forces one to go stop working and go have meaningful human interaction.",1232993510

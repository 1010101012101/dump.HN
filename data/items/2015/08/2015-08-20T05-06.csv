Though SQL as a language in my opinion is not pretty: the utility of SQL databases(my favourite being Postgres) is undeniable.<p>I&#x27;ve seen POs choose MongoDB because it&#x27;s &quot;webscale&quot;(believe me when I say we don&#x27;t need it), and often enough we end up with a situation where with joins our queries would be trivial, but with MongoDB, the queries are often only feasible at all with aggressive denormalization. Such denormalization is typically error prone, complex, and slow to insert.<p>Node itself is pretty spectacular, if for nothing but the ease with which you can take a synchronous single-node system, and factor it into a distributed system. In most environments this is infeasibly difficult, Rails seems to me like one such environment.<p>Clojure is an interesting and pragmatic language with a whole lot of cutting-edge work in datastructures having leading implementations there.
LISPs also have inherent magical powers which I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard explained ad nauseam by a little-known chap called Paul Graham or something, maybe his website Hacker News is written in one.",1440050349

In a free market there is a transaction when both (all) parties agree on a deal, every party is free to say no. In education and healthcare a one-sided &quot;no&quot; means a less secure future or even death respectively. It means rich will continue to have better resources, live longer and be healthier. It means their children, who did no work to obtain their wealth have better chances.<p>I think a system where the schools/colleges/universities etc are paid with public money are more fair. Such a system provides a reset of opportunities for every generation. I think it will even lead to a better market as I can&#x27;t imagine that &quot;the top 1%&quot; also provides the top 1% smartest and motivated children.<p>Of course everyone is free to vote for their own system, I&#x27;m just saying I would prefer to live in a country where I&#x27;m helped when I&#x27;m ill, no questions asked and where I have the same chances as any other kid of my generation.<p>Can you really blame Walter White for cooking meth when his life is on the line? Can you really blame a kid from a poor neighborhood when he ventures into crime? They are born with less chances than a kid that was born in better circumstances. The current American system judges and gives kids opportunities based on what their parents earn in stead of on their motivation and intelligence. It will be reflected in American markets. It will increase the gap between rich and poor because both are on a self amplifying course.<p>And don&#x27;t start about Darwinism, this is past that, this is Darwinism of ideas: memes. And any brain can be &quot;infected&quot; by a meme, good or bad. Memes are not restricted to a set of genes and they are much more at the root of the economy than DNA is. And memes are perpetuated and destroyed by raising kids and giving them quality education.<p>I like the speech, it nicely points out the downsides of the current system for those on the inside of that system.

I grew up in a decent, moderately sized city (300k) going to a private religious school with children whose parents were similarly strongly interested in the intellectual development of their children.<p>I had access to all the sports teams. I played soccer through Varsity, played with the golf team [but note I was not <i>on</i> the golf team...lol], and basketball in middle school. I played piano for 8 years. I attended one of the top 5 schools of my field in the nation, and graduated into a small company with other graduates from my school, MIT, etc. From &#x27;good places&#x27;.<p>Because of this, education was always something I always took for granted. I always valued it, but always took it for granted. Some of my education, however, took humans for granted. Your value to society was sometimes considered limited by what you could produce. Additionally, many of those I highschooled and undergraduated with (mainly other purported Christians who I have since determined were not living congruently with stated beliefs) held little reservation filtering people out of their life based on, I&#x27;ll call it,<p>&#x27;being dumb&#x27;.<p>This always bothered me. As fruit of my religion [mainly &#x27;made in God&#x27;s image&#x27;, combined with looking at the life Jesus lived] I believed in the intrinsic value of the human, so I always sought to correct for it: because I always tried my hardest, it never occurred to me how people could willfully and knowingly not aspire themselves to something greater than what required minimal effort. Everyone I grew up with did [though, in hindsight, for different reasons than I], I did, and my parents did, so naturally I assumed everyone else did, too. As such, I was regularly perplexed at the value judgements certain colleagues would place on other members of humanity...like me...because they miscategorized generational challenges I was facing as &#x27;being dumb&#x27;. Damaging prejudice.<p>So I left that company, and struck out on my own. I have since discovered what a rare breed my background nurtured, and now understand the wisdom in filtering those you spend time with. Instead of a prideful superiority [which I certainly observed], I exercise with a cautious respect for, and in protection of, talent and time. I exercise without placing value judgements <i>on</i> the people I come in contact with, but I do judge the values <i>of</i> the people I spend time with. In this way I safely continue to respect their humanity, and avoid pride.
It&#x27;s only since I moved and became aware of my need to protect that I became aware of how hard it is to find knowledge seekers. And so, when I come across someone from a different field but similar excellence, who carries with them persuasive content helpful for advancement, I am thankful. I also realized I need to stop spending so much time trying to argue with people-- because most people aren&#x27;t actually listening, aren&#x27;t actually seeking.<p>And so I am thankful to have found HackerNews, this article, and shared insights like yours.<p>It&#x27;s very important to surround yourself with excellence.

Almost all of this time was dedicated study time. I was frankly amazed at how few of these opportunities students took advantage off – every building and every dorm room had similar jobs and I was always able to pick up extra hours if I needed to. I had a few entrepreneurial friends that also worked night shifts at 7/11s or the front desks of nursing homes who were also able to get paid to study all through college. With the exception of the 7/11 gigs, studying was always encouraged. My impression was that college students felt these jobs were beneath them and/or did not take the time to seek them out.

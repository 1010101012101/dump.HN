They then pass through a pair of accelerating electrodes, where they are accelerated and bombarded against a phosphor screen.<p>The paper does present a new method, but they are still using a streak camera:<p>> To overcome this limitation, here we present CUP (Fig. 1), which can provide 2D dynamic imaging using a streak camera without employing any mechanical or optical scanning mechanism with a single exposure.<p>---<p>I do not know anything about the topic, so I can&#x27;t answer any questions.

I don&#x27;t know the entirety of the reason, but presumably to help prevent decreasing the value of existing bitcoins for all time. (If you kept minting them, there&#x27;d always be new ones devaluing existing ones, like how the US gov&#x27;t does with dollars).<p>Buying means you buy already-minted bitcoins. You can buy them privately or on exchanges. Then they&#x27;re yours. The exchanges&#x27; role is to facilitate trading between users, and they operate at a profit (they charge you a % to buy). Basically, it&#x27;d be hard to sell your bitcoin if you didn&#x27;t have exchanges. You&#x27;d be posting on craigslist or something. And people would be scamming you for the money. Stuff like that.<p>Anyone can mine on virtually any hardware, however due to competition, it&#x27;s hard to mine profitably. You have to have specialty equipment that is both very good and very efficient (power-wise). You can mine on your own or as part of a pool, but you essentially have to &#x27;get lucky&#x27; on your own, and it&#x27;s very unlikely that&#x27;ll happen. My advice is to not think about mining until you&#x27;ve done a lot of research and for some reason decide you want to do it. It&#x27;s a bad idea for almost every non-expert at this point.",1421546034
8906311,comment,8904980,8905678,0,0,pjc50,,,"There are four basic lines of argument:<p>- legal. It&#x27;s against the law; there are strong 1st and 4th arguments against surveillance, and 5th and 6th amendment arguments as well. Some people have even tried to argue that if encryption is a munition the 2nd amendment applies. The &quot;we could stop bad people&quot; argument applies <i>especially</i> to the 4th.<p>Similar legal protections exist in Europe, although not generally as strong.<p>- practical: either a system is secure or it isn&#x27;t. Handing it over to anyone increases the risk of compromise. Bans on effective encryption are self-defeating.<p>- collateral damage: US intelligence agencies have a track record of killing innocent people themselves (e.g. drone strikes), supporting murderous governments (CIA in south america), funding terrorism and failing to prosecute the guilty (Iran-contra), use of intelligence for domestic immoral politics (Watergate, FBI vs MLK). Handing over data about your e.g. Chilean users to the CIA may result in them being murdered.<p>- international hypocrisy: saying that mass surveillance is OK says it&#x27;s OK for other governments too. Do you support Chinese interception against <i>their</i> adversaries? Are you happy to turn over your entire email history on entering a country?<p>- finally, I&#x27;m going to question how much it does help. The Paris terrorists were known to the police, as was the killer of Lee Rigby. Intercept evidence is generally not used in trials. Nobody is presenting a cache of encrypted emails found on a computer used by the Parisian terrorists and saying &quot;if we&#x27;d decrypted this we could have prevented it&quot;.",1421546026

The easiest way to discredit someone is to point out technical ignorance in their argument. So I&#x27;d make my point technically sound on all points.

But now that we have reached the top-of-the-line 28-20nm, Bitcoin ASIC developers are just waiting for foundries to make the next node available (16nm), so the lifetime of a Bitcoin miner should grow from less than a year to at east ~2 years.<p>If a Bitcoin miner lasts ~2 years, its hardware cost is relatively small compared to electricity costs, so replacing them is not much an issue: a $1500 2kW Neptune consumes $3500 of electricity over 2 years at $0.10/kWh. TCO = $5000. The hardware represents only 30% of that. So not only it is affordable but it makes sense to throw that hardware away and replace it for a more efficient one after 2 years.",1421544474

I suspect the audio quality at 6 MHz to be far better than an FM signal which is nominally 100KHz wide.  The FM system is more resistant to amplitude changes (due to distance, etc) but can&#x27;t encode as much data as the VSB-AM signal used by NTSC.<p>There are a few caveats and I haven&#x27;t looked at the transmitter/receiver pair he purchased.  If it&#x27;s simply 6MHz of bandwidth transmitted for some specified distance, it will probably work.  SPDIF is a digital signal and while it runs at 6Mbps, there are significant harmonics that can be passed through the fiber.  Since we can assume the first harmonic will pass through the link, you can expect a signal which has more sinusoid pulses coming back out of the receiver.  With a PLL to recover the clock and a good data recovery circuit added to the receiver, I&#x27;m guessing he could easily push this link to 50 to 100 feet.<p>As an aside, the NTSC signal is actually sending far more information as a whole and while it uses an AGC to overcome amplitude changes during transmission (the sync pulse is adjusted to be -0.3V), it also uses a comb filter to recover chroma information and the luminense is AM modulated above at the pixel clock rate.  Your eyes are actually pretty low resolution compared to your ears and there are lots of ways to fool the brain&#x27;s image processing (e.g. interlace makes a 30FPS system look more like 60FPS).<p>In any case, a very creative build!",1421544221

8906197,comment,8904707,8905490,0,0,this_user,,,"One difference between professional traders and amateurs is that pros don&#x27;t judge a trade by its outcome but by the idea and its execution. What makes something a good trade is if it is a good idea at the time based on the available information. But even the best idea may not work out and that&#x27;s where risk management comes into play. Conversely, you can also make money on a bad trade, but it&#x27;s still a bad trade. A professional trader&#x27;s job is not to predict the future but to make good trades.<p>Taleb&#x27;s idea may have been good at the time that simply did not work out. Of course, his statement tells you nothing about the concrete implementation of this idea which more often than not will make all the difference w.r.t. a trade&#x27;s outcome. Maybe he even did actually make money from the idea. There&#x27;s really nothing to suggest that he would have shorted in 2010 and just held the position since then.",1421543259

The previous night we had a few drinks and then called it a night and walked home together.<p>Jerry, in the morning mentioned to someone that his shoulder really hurt, but he couldn&#x27;t remember hurting it.<p>We came up with a plan that morning to convince Jerry that he had been sideswiped by a taxi, and got into a fight with a taxi driver. We emailed everyone we were with the night before, explained to them what we were doing, and started planting that idea in Jerry&#x27;s mind.<p>At first he claimed that it never happened. He kept saying he knew we were just fucking with him.<p>More and more people corroborated the story. We even had a military police officer call him on the phone to inquire about the incident. We got his boss to sit him down and have a talk with him about his problem with alcohol (he doesn&#x27;t drink that much).<p>Eventually as the story was repeated to him by everyone, especially people with authority, Jerry went from:<p>&quot;this never happened.. I only had two beer last night&quot;\nto: &quot;hmm... maybe I was really drunk after all... but I don&#x27;t remember anything&quot;\nto: &quot;Yeah... I remember everything now! How could I have forgotten before? Crazy!?!?&quot;<p>He turned our story into real memories and even started adding his own details to the story. We thought that was hilarious.<p>That night we all got together and told Jerry that it was all just a joke. He couldn&#x27;t believe it. He argued with us that he was sure it did happen. He remembered it. When he finally accepted it he felt really dumb, but it was a really fun day at work for us, so definitely worth it.",1421542949

The huge advantage is that you can update your MacBook to the latest version frequently, without having to deal with all the pain points the GP describes.<p>The same benefits accrue even more so for Windows; not because of hardware incompatibility (there are Windows drivers for all Macbook hardware) but because of system decrepitude. I have never had a physical machine that booted Windows for 7 years (or even 2 years) that didn&#x27;t become hopelessly fucked up, whether due to installing some weird open source thing, malware, or Windows Update.<p>But I have had the same 3 Windows VMs (XP, 7, and 8.1) running since the day I installed Windows on them, albeit with significant help from my frequent use of VMWare Fusion&#x27;s snapshot feature.<p>The only big drawback is graphics performance -- if you want to play games I don&#x27;t think you would be happy with the solution, but it works great for virtually any other usage.",1421542887

That's theoretically possible, but I have trouble believing that you could keep it up for a whole 10 hours, unless the work you're doing is <i>completely</i> mindless.  And if that's the case, why did it take you 1500 lines?<p>Now, I just mailed off a code review yesterday that probably has over 1500 lines of diffs (it's 44 files, and I could believe that each file is easily averaging 30 lines).  However, most of those are just deleting a line or two and then changing the indentation of the whole file to match.  The change as a whole is behavior-neutral: it doesn't actually <i>do</i> anything.  It's pretty easy to get distorted statistics like that - often the changes with the most lines do the least.",1265399985

There are some terrains/situations where a manual transmission is far superior to an automatic, but the majority of people will never experience them. So, the convenience of the automatic works great for most people.<p>The question I have with tablet computing is this: my computer usage is extremely multi-tasking - I have actually tried to pay some attention to this recently. I'll put the pasta to boil or something, and then I will hit the computer for 8 minutes. During those 8 minutes I might contribute to a few IM sessions, set off 4 or 5 tabs loading with the top HN stories and scan them, check my RSS feeds, check personal and work email and reply to anything that can be dealt quickly, check the state of my gentoo compile, tag some photos in digikam and set an upload to smugmug, and look up a recipe for tomorrow's dinner. The only reason I can do all that in 8 minutes is by aggressive keyboard shortcuts and desktop-switching.<p>I do have an iPhone and I do really like it, but it's not a multi-tasking device - not due to the OS, but due to the UI.<p>So the real question is - how rare am I in my computer usage? Am I analogous to the rare driver that tackles unpaved mountain roads, and so need my niche manual transmission while the rest of the world is happy with their automatics? Is the multi-tasking a geek thing, or do ""regular"" people do this?",1265399967

1104629,comment,1103578,1103578,0,0,dasil003,,,"First, learn to recognize good design.  Some people claim that you can't learn good taste, but I disagree.  You just need to pay close attention to <i>everything</i> you see on a daily basis and store it in an accessible part of your brain.  Most people don't store design information, they just store whatever was communicated.<p>Formal training can be of tremendous value here, but in this day and age it's also viable to be completely self taught, especially with some good books.<p>Once you have an eye for design you can apply the basic principles as described in other comments here.  Without the eye then the principles are meaningless.  You also won't learn much by looking at your own work.  You're too close to it, so objectivity is all but impossible.  You need to leave it alone for a month, absorb as much design training as you can, then come back to it with a fresh eye and quickly critique it before miring yourself in the details again.",1265399914
1104628,comment,1104554,1104554,0,0,grellas,,,"Actually, the securities laws do permit investments by non-accredited investors within limits. For example, California has a so-called limited offering exemption by which a corporation can issue stock to up to 35 non-accredited investors in any given round who have a pre-existing relationship with the company or its founders and who warrant that they are acquiring the stock as an investment and not for resale (federal law also supports investment by non-accredited investors, as for example under Rule 504 of Regulation D). This exemption would generally allow, for example, for a company sale of stock to the employee who saves up $10K and wants to buy in an angel round.<p>Though the law allows limited avenues for such non-accredited investments, the securities law rules nonetheless operate in practical terms to bar most such opportunities. VCs, for example, are very hesitant to invest in a company along with a lot of non-accredited investors. This means that startups will hesitate to open up such opportunities.<p>Thus, the essential point of this piece is a good one. Why arbitrarily restrict the ability of individuals to invest in promising opportunities? The theory of the securities laws is that investor protection warrants the restrictions and this impulse, far from being on the decline today, remains strong (there are, for example, current attempts in Congress to <i>increase</i> the requirements for what it takes to qualify as an accredited investor). So the question becomes, in re-evaluating these requirements, should the law take a more, or a less, paternalistic direction. Protection is fine but it does have its costs in limiting choice.<p>While I have not given much thought to how the restrictions might be eased, I would definitely say that the efforts currently afoot to tighten them would be a horrible mistake for the startup world, for founders and investors alike.",1265399895

Is there any way we can help each other out as friends? I love to help people out. I can give slots at my conferences, and I know a lot of bright kids looking for unpaid internships, and oh by the way I do some writing for TechCrunch too. Do I need any help? Well, I always want to hear about good story ideas and meet other interesting people. As my boss Michael Arrington has said, send us scoops and we'll think fondly of you and be more likely to report on you later! Also my side projects are hurting for equipment. You know, Company X gave us a projector when our old one broke.

1104609,comment,1103578,1103578,0,0,tel,,,"A common misconception is that ""simple"" is easy to do. Instead, it's often as hard if not more difficult. Solid design is a battle won in the detail and with simple designs you have fewer details that each must be perfect.<p>For example: The left part of DedaSys
  - The fonts are sized as to have an ambiguous hierarchy
  - The shadows are not consistent and thus break the illusion of layered paper
    - (especially important is that the shadow on the yellow bar at the top
       doesn't match the shadow in the menu block)
  - The current location box is larger than the others once 
    again breaking the illusion of layered paper
  - The grey line surrounding the whole thing crosses layers<p>On your personal site
  - The text grids are not equal or obviously intentionally unequal
  - The navigation headers are almost randomly arranged
  - The picture doesn't fit well into the gridlines formed by your text
  - Your text doesn't have a visual flow<p>Each of these criticisms is a tiny fix in and of itself, but they build an emotional reaction in a viewer. It's an unfortunate circumstance that your designs are judged by all viewers on the same level as those done by professionals. No matter how hard you try, nothing looks ""good"" unless it's close enough to perfect that people can't tell it isn't.<p><pre><code>  ---
</code></pre>
So, what are you going to do?<p>Simple designs are a good place to start: you can iterate them much more quickly, and, just like all design, you definitely are going to be iterating.<p>Graphic design can be thought of as the unification of a message with a design metaphor. Simple designs should have simple messages and simple metaphors. Interestingly, your sites provide a great comparison. DedaSys has a simple message (a shallow hierarchy) but a complex metaphor (stacked, multicolored paper in hard lighting). Your personal site has a simple metaphor (text blocks in white void) but a complex message (highly nested hierarchy with many levels of equal importance makes it difficult to skim).<p>So pick a simple metaphor and craft a simple message and then keep iterating.<p><pre><code>  - single sheet of brilliant plain paper with two columns
  - a sheet of nice, lined paper lain on textured wall paint
  - Two sheets of paper, laid atop one another, with shadows between them

  (these all involve paper because it's easy to visualize, but it's possible
   to get more exotic while still being simple)

  - a pane of glass with big bold letters stuck to it, held over interesting scenes
    which are wildly out of focus in the background
</code></pre>
Visualizations of your message and metaphor drive the ""simple"" details which build your design, but you should always be moving in a positive direction. There are three focuses I like to use:<p><pre><code>  1. intent: make it clear that even your accidents were thought out
  2. consistency: if you've made an intentional decision, defer to 
     it throughout the design
  3. illusion: let a realistic design metaphor guide your decisions

  ---
</code></pre>
So with that theory in mind, there are also a few pretty common design tricks that help you to be effective. All sorts of comments have already covered these, but I'll reiterate<p><pre><code>  1. Pick a grid, both horizontal *and vertical* and stick to it
  2. Study other designs, especially classic and powerful ones like 
     Coca-cola's logo or a newspaper, and understand what makes them 
     attractive. Steal it.
  3. Study the shape and appearance of real things. If you can physically 
     build what you want your website to look like, you have a wonderful
     guide for how to design it.
  4. Study a little typography. It's a very old art which has strong traditions.
     Some of them are important and necessary, some of them are simply important
     because of consistency. We're all expert consumers of type design, whether
     we know it or not.

  and finally

  5. Break any and all of these rules when you think you should, but know when 
     you're doing it and DO IT INTENTIONALLY. Breaking a rule shyly looks
     terrible. Breaking one with panaché makes something striking and phenomenal.

Typical color LCD/CRT screens have only red, green, and blue pixels - a tetrochromat wouldn't get any signal on the fourth channel.  Computer displays increase the number of colors by increasing the number of bits per channel, but with 24-bit color (8 bits per channel), you're already showing 256 different intensities of light, while the human eye can only distinguish 100.  You'd either need special displays or an eye that can pick up more gradations of color per channel to increase the color bandwidth.<p>I think this effect may be because of another phenomenon I heard about in my psych class: females tend to have larger vocabularies for color than men do.  Whether that means they can <i>see</i> more colors or <i>say</i> more colors remains to be determined (and my philosophy class said it <i>can't</i> be determined ;-)), but the net result is that you get better color feedback from a woman.",1265399205

Like I said, my kid is not even two years old, and predicting the world he'll be entering the labor market in is effectively impossible right now, because there's a <i>crapload</i> of trends that simply Can. Not. Continue. And therefore won't, the only question being in what manner they will not continue.<p>For instance, I'm not sweating trying to put aside vast quantities of money for college education. Why am I doing this horrible thing? Well, tuition has been going up by about twice the rate of inflation for a long time now (<a href=""http://www.finaid.org/savings/tuition-inflation.phtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.finaid.org/savings/tuition-inflation.phtml</a> ), and projecting that out, it's another 70% increase in real tuition prices over what I already consider the completely unsustainable tuition rates of today. I don't know what will happen, but today's traditional ""four-year college you live at"" is not going to be the only choice, or possible even the dominant choice, by then.<p>Similarly, health care insurance simply can not continue increasing at the rate it is currently increasing at for another 20 years. It's physically impossible. Who knows what will happen instead?<p>Housing prices are also very difficult to predict once it really settles in that housing is not a good investment.<p>It's a choice he'll make with eyes wide open if I can help it, but it's his choice, not mine, and frankly neither of us sitting here in 2010 have more than a passing clue what sort of world he'd be making that choice in.

1104495,comment,1103773,1103773,0,0,dkimball,,,"Another interesting thing is that birds represent an evolutionary road not taken. All modern birds are descended from a small theropod dinosaur, possibly _Velociraptor deinonychus_ itself -- a more plausible candidate for the star of ""Jurassic Park"" than _V. mongoliensis_, although it was only re-classified as a velociraptor in the late 1990s. It probably ran, fought, and foraged like a crane (although this is convergent evolution, as cranes probably evolved from small shorebirds called rails), and may have looked like something halfway between a crane and an eagle.<p>Of course, no intelligent birds exist, but we can see enough of the personalities of some species to get a sense of how an intelligent bird might act. They'd probably be less tribal, less extended-family-oriented, less self-serving than humans, more aloof and self-reliant, more like a startup founder... but also much more violent and warlike, as no avian however large has the same instinctive reluctance to kill a member of its own species that all large mammals share.<p>I don't know nearly as much about the _other_ path not taken, the cephalopods -- but I've read enough about the behavior of Humboldt's and giant squid when confronted by an unfamiliar sight to get the impression that there is a reason why nature didn't manage to take it. Unlike squid, octopodes are not psychotic, but they're easily bored and they have a malicious sense of humor. The urban legend of the octopus who waits until the lights are out and the aquarium-keepers have left, then crawls out of the water and goes over to the neighboring fish tank to have a snack before slipping back to his own tank before the morning, has happened any number of times.<p>Little-known medieval trivia point: if St. Thomas Aquinas was right about a certain speculation, the study of avian and cephalopod behaviors is probably a prudent one. Aquinas believed that if other worlds capable of supporting intelligent life exist, they _would_ be populated by intelligent beings, since God wouldn't let a perfectly good dwelling-place for souls go to waste. The only question, to the medieval mind, was whether such worlds existed (and, secondarily, whether Christ would have come to them separately had they fallen, or whether it would have been necessary to convert them to Catholicism; for more on this mindset, read C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy and perhaps Poul Anderson's _The High Crusade_).",1265397294

Referring back to the white-on-yellow highlighting several paragraphs along is a clever way to unify the piece.

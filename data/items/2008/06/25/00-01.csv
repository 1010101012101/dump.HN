Maybe, Not yet, But...",http://www.shirlawsonline.com/blogs/197-my-pond-theory-or-why-social-networks-must-fail,"There's been a lot of discussion here lately about the quality of front page stories, comments, and the community at large. Is it still focussed, or are we going down the bland road to mediocrity other social sites have done?<p>In one of these discussions (on potential pg bias http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=165855 ) I came up with a visual of a social website (network/ bookmarking / whatever) being like a pond with a series of ripples.<p>I've now expanded on this on my blog - more reflection made me wonder if the growth of social sites might necessarily lead to homogenization<p>http://www.shirlawsonline.com/blogs/197-my-pond-theory-or-why-social-networks-must-fail<p>and what might be done to prevent it\nhttp://www.shirlawsonline.com/blogs/199-my-pond-theory-or-how-social-networks-avoid-failing<p>Is HN too far gone? What can we do to stop it from becoming the next Digg?",1214355176

227012,comment,226811,226967,0,0,derefr,,,"The door closes when the pressure coils (a.k.a. the ones that ring the bells at gas stations, and the spaced out ones used for speed detection) on the floor detect the vehicle has been parked. If it detects that you are no longer moving toward it, it will also close. The garage will learn which cars you park inside and which you leave outside it, so it might open at the wrong times the first few times, but once you've trained its filter, it'll do fine. You'll obviously be able to open it manually (that is, with a key fob) as well, in order to train it. If you want to let your friends park in your garage, just put ""my friends are coming over by car"" on your calendar.<p>And none of this will happen, of course, if your garage is full.",1214354538

Leaping on to the business model of the week becomes a substitute for self-assessment and critical reflection. And of course there is the ""ooh that's cool, I want to build one of those!"" factor to be considered.",1214354039

Well written, too.<p>But somehow, all these articles about Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, don't really strike me as interesting. Do we really care that much about what other analysts say? Does all that political and religious bickering over operating systems really matter? Somehow, reading the continuous articles about ""Microsoft's Problem"" or ""Why (Mac|Google|Linux|Ubuntu) Will Win"" or ""Why Microsoft is Doomed"" just doesn't really excite me.

SQS's design has its uses and S3's ordered key-space makes it easy to create queue structures without this behavior if that's what you think you want.<p>The thing I too would like to see from AWS would be some kind of callback api where an HTTP request would be sent to an EC2 instance when something useful happens in S3.

I was really surprised when I learned that my then 13 year old son was regularly spending hours online with armed service personnel stationed in Europe, disabled diabetics from Iowa in their 40's, thirty-something gay couples from Palo Alto, off-duty nurses from Los Angeles, etc.   In short just about every kind of person he would never otherwise consider part of his social group.<p>So personally I think the real reason it is successful is that it seems to be able to create the same kind of opportunity for shared experience across cultures in much the same way early radio and television did.",1214352128

Second, it is effectively a defence of opacity and inequity in financial regulation. And it seems coherent, too, though verbose. But I hesitate to accept it without having read the book and without any experience in the realm of central banking.",1230911676

It would be easy to assemble and wouldn't require expensive new lithium-ion battery technology or exotic composite materials. It would seat at least six, have a range of 400 miles on a fill-up, and get 35-40 miles per gallon with greatly reduced emissions. It would run on gas, diesel, biodiesel, or ethanol.

Granted, it's probably better integrated with Android, though.<p>The problem with running ""other code"" (Open Office, for example), is that all graphics have to go through the Android interface - the whole GUI is done with Java/Dalvik.

Clojure?<p>Even CL has some of the best libraries I've used, although coverage can be spotty at times.<p>This still hasn't killed all the other programming languages, which leads me to believe that libraries aren't actually what matters.  I think, instead, that most people pick programming languages based on what's crammed down their throats.  For a UNIX app, you ""have to"" use C.  For everything else, you ""have to"" use Java, since that's what you learned at school (now it's .NET too).<p>Popularity is overrated anyway.  Haskell and SBCL are not exactly popular, but they have great runtimes, important modern features, and plenty of libraries and tools.  The only reason not to use them is because you'd rather use Java instead.",1230908976

Of course, you should have a zero balance before you take them up on the offer and not use it for purchases or subscriptions in the mean time.",1230908835

So I'm not surprised that it still carries that connotation... the real surprise is that the connotation is wearing off. We're getting to the point where your proposed definitions sound more and more reasonable. Because it no longer takes five years of advance planning, an enormous staff, office buildings, multiple factories, and all the other big-company trappings to scale up a small company, if that company is on the web.",1230908598

Worker suicides would cause a tremendous loss of face for Foxconn while preserving the face of the workers' families. The point of an anti-suicide contract is not to prevent people from feeling suicidal but to prevent the individual who signs it from holding that over Foxconn as a threat. If someone committed suicide after signing such a contract, the contract has priority and the loss of face would be from the worker's family.",1326232736

You name-drop Apple, and the article name-drops Microsoft, but its also Intel, IBM, Samsung, Sony, Acer, Asus, MSI, EVGA, and a myriad of other high-profile tech companies using Foxconn.  It'd be more instructive to make a list of companies that are <i>not</i> using them.  And even then, whats to say that they're not using equally poor labor that just hasn't been publicized like Foxconn has?<p>In other words, in order to ditch every piece of technology that's got a foundation in human exploitation and suffering, you practically have to ditch technology altogether.

3449233,comment,3447475,3447622,6,0,bodyfour,,,"Probably just a historical artifact; it's common at places with <i>long</i> Unix histories.<p>The first UNIX machine that I used (circa 1985-1986) had one shell: /bin/sh.  No command history, no anything.  If you made a typo you had to re-type the whole line, being more careful this time (of course this is before we had graphical terminals with cut&paste)  In fact, it was a common habit that if you were going to run a complicated command you'd write a one-off shell script, just so you could edit it if it didn't work.<p>After some months we managed to get a copy of /bin/csh, and it was a godsend.  Now we had a history buffer.. you couldn't do anything ""modern"" like editing the command line with arrow keys (and certainly no tab-completion yet; some later versions of csh supported completion using the escape key however)  However you had things like ""!!"", ""!$"", ""^foo^bar"" for at least modifying the last command run.  All of these csh-isms later appeared in bash, btw.<p>csh was simply such a huge improvement for interactive use you could hardly <i>not</i> use it.  The only downside was that it had its own incompatible scripting language which was supposed to be more C-like but actually was just fairly busted.  Worse, this was before ""#!/bin/sh"" was understood by the kernel so scripts just broke: for some reason anything that started with a comment, csh would decide to run itself and fail.  However there was a hack where if you started the script with a line that just had "":"" it would pass it to /bin/sh instead.  So we updated all our scripts and life was good.<p>A few years later when tcsh was getting popular, migrating to it was natural.  You could keep your existing .cshrc/.login files and get all of the modern tab-competing, line-editing goodness.  There was a time in the 1990s when just about everybody seemed to be running tcsh except for a handful of ksh fans.<p>Once you're on tcsh the motivation to move to bash is smaller.. after all, most things work OK.  Personally I only converted about 5 years ago: I got sick of having to install tcsh on new machines so I sat down and rewrote my 800-line .cshrc that I'd accumulated over 20 years.<p>I'm glad I did though.  There are often times when I just want to write a short script on the command line (something a simple as ""for x in a b c; do blah; done"") but I could never remember the csh syntax.  So I was always dropping from csh to sh to run them or even doing ""sh -c '...'""  It's much nicer just being able to type that at my shell prompt.",1326232156

Almost any programmer should be able to do the first 50 programs with random brute-force methods that are only a few lines long, but that doesn't do anything other than demonstrate you can have a computer add together numbers based on an if-statement.<p>It especially doesn't show you know how to bring together technologies that are useful for doing things such as building a website.",1326231769

3449183,comment,3447028,3448983,5,0,bzbarsky,,,"The maximum you can contribute is somewhat inflation-pegged.  As of this year, it's $3050 for an individual plan and $6150 for a family plan (plus an extra $1000 per person involved over the age of 55).<p>Note that the contribution is pre-tax, so if you're at the 25% marginal federal rate and contribute $3000 you have to compare that to getting at most ~$2020 in after-tax money: HSA contributions are not subject to FICA (7.65%) or federal income tax (25% on the margin per above assumption).  They're not subject to state income taxes either; those can range from 0% to 12% depending on state and income level.<p>Another important thing to keep in mind is that this is a health _savings_ account.  Your contribution stays in the account if you're not spending it on actual medical care; it doesn't disappear at year end.  Money in the HSA can be invested if desired (though it's probably a good idea to leave at least the deductible amount in liquid funds).  Interest, dividends, and capital gains on the money are not taxed.  When you reach retirement age, you can withdraw the money for any reason, not just medical care.<p>So basically an HSA is just like a traditional IRA in terms of tax treatment, but with the added ability to make early withdrawals to pay for medical care.  The only drawback is that you can only open one if you have a high-deductible plan (defined as at least $1200 for an individual and $2400 for a family, as of this year).  So you're basically gambling that the tax savings and possible future growth of the money, plus what you save on premiums, will be higher than the deductible.<p>Going back to our case of a single individual at the 25% marginal rate, with $100 premiums for the high-deductible plan and $300 premiums for the low-deductible plan, the difference in premiums is $2400.  If you're depositing those $3000, your tax savings are about $1000.  So you'd have to spend more than $3600/year on average on medical care to lose out.  For most young-and-healthy folks, spending on medical care is likely to be less than this.  Note that the 25% bracket starts at a taxable income of about $34,500, so figure a salary of at most $50,000.  If you're earning more than that and are single, chances are an HSA is a good deal for you.",1326231477

An exception is harder-to-monetize research, like running clinical trials for old generic medications where it's not profitable for the private sector to do so (since they wouldn't be able to patent the result), or studying diseases that primarily affect poor countries.",1326230582

3449076,comment,3448027,3448478,8,0,pak,,,"Let's modify the GP's example--instead of checking if an array contains something, he wants to return a copy where a callback is applied to each element.  Kind of like ""map"".  However, if the array contains other arrays, he wants to return an empty array.<p>No problemo in Ruby:<p><pre><code>  def map_unless_nested(arr)
    arr.map {|v| return [] if v.is_a? Array; yield v}
  end

  map_unless_nested([2,3,4,5]) {|v| v+1 }
  # => [3,4,5,6]
  map_unless_nested([2,[3,4],5]) {|v| v+1 }
  # => []
</code></pre>
This starts looking ugly in JavaScript if we want to generalize ""map"".  Either we can keep ""map"" clean and wrap our callback so it throws exceptions on array input:<p><pre><code>  function map(arr, callback) {
    var ret = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      ret.push(callback(arr[i]));
    }
    return ret;
  }
  
  function map_unless_nested(arr, callback) {
    try {
      return map(arr, function(v) { 
        if (v instanceof Array) throw ""nested!""; 
        return callback(v);
      });
    } catch (e) {
      if (e===""nested!"") { return []; }
      throw e;
    }
  }

  map_unless_nested([2,3,4,5], function(v){ return v + 1; })
  // => [3,4,5,6]
  map_unless_nested([2,[3,4],5], function(v){ return v + 1; })
  // => []
</code></pre>
Or, if we want to keep the callback clean, we have to start fiddling with map, and then it's no longer really just map (it's map with halting parameters), and then you're using special return values to inform calling functions that the halting condition was met.<p><pre><code>  function map_unless_test(arr, callback, test) {
    var ret = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (test(arr[i])) { return false; }
      ret.push(callback(arr[i]));
    }
    return ret;
  }
  
  function map_unless_nested(arr, callback) {
    return map_unless_test(arr, callback, function(v) { 
      return v instanceof Array;
    }) || [];
  }
</code></pre>
If you still think that exceptions are the best language feature to solve this example, consider the situation where you want to do something with those nested arrays.  For example, let's take the Ruby example and modify it so it will return a copy of the first-encountered innermost array with the callback applied.<p><pre><code>  def map_first_innermost(arr, &block)
    arr.map do |v|
      return map_first_innermost(v, &block) if v.is_a? Array
      yield v
    end
  end
</code></pre>

China could make the same transformation based entirely on domestic demand the way the Western countries did, but instead, China gets the demand from the Western countries, plus Korea and Japan to speed up the process, plus all the cool technology we've developed to make it go faster.

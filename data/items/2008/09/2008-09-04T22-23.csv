I can inspect dynamically created elements by right clicking on them, where in FireBug somehow the link kept getting activated.<p>I also like how it computes the styles, but I'm not sure how to track down the computations.  However, these are all my falling-outs.  The browser works nicely.<p>Although, Shockwave Flash just crashed while listening to pandora and using the webkit inspector.  Related?",1220569008

But in terms of user friendly features (who doesn't prompt to close a window with tabs?) it has a long way to go. Google has a history of this write strong powerful utilities and make them shiny later. I have nothing wrong with this, as long as they realize they are doing it. It is the Unix way after all, and we all know the Unix way is the right way :p",1220568798

It adds classical inheritance to JavaScript, not unlike what most JavaScript libraries try to do, except it cleans it up (IMO) with Objective-C style syntax.<p>Even SproutCore is resorts to preprocessing code to get syntax enhancements, like their sc_super(whatever) which is converted to arguments.callee.base(this, whatever).",1220568768

I know IBM is still selling servers, but obviously a browser isn't much use on an 8 node node Power6 server.  Seems like maybe PPC isn't a platform worth targeting new desktop software to...though, since it's open source, as long as its endian-sane, it ought to just be a recompile away, once it works on Linux.",1220568679
295287,comment,294788,294788,0,0,gamble,,,"Historically, the most successful 'unions' have been the professional medical, legal, and engineering associations, since they've been delegated the right under law to control the number of practitioners. For IT unionization to work, you'd need to persuade government to treat it as an engineering profession and require licensure. Personally, I think the window of opportunity to professionalize IT has long since closed.",1220568436

Since impressions bring in such small amounts of revenue compared to clicks we're really not shitting the scales very much.

If it was a jump into the deep end or a slow progression.<p>For me it seems to have been a slow progression over years.

295284,comment,295197,295197,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think this is pretty disappointing coming from Harvard Business publishing.<p>Google isn't trying to create new grand markets that they might or might not get a share of, they are simply commoditizing their complementary products, and making them as good as possible.<p>Complementary products are products that are used together, and where one enhances the other - cars and gasoline are classic examples. By commoditizing, or making cheaper,  your complementary product your own product becomes more desirable: If gas is cheaper cars are more desirable. This is classical economics, and has been known since Adam Smith.<p>Basically what this means for Google is that they have a strong interest in commoditizing the webbrowser, making it as good as possible, thus making their own complementary products more desirable. This is also one of the reasons they are interested in firefox - it isn't philanthropy: it's purely business.",1220568134

Philly might not be known for its tech scene as much, or very early stage investing, so DreamIt has been a big step for the ecosystem here.  Philosophy on investing seems different than what I see in Silicon Valley and NYC.<p>There is money here: Entrepreneur Magazine's VC 100 in August 2008 listed Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern PA as tied for 3rd in the country as far as #deals done.  Josh Kopelman and Chris Fralic from First Round Capital are here too.<p>There is community here: Phillystartupleaders.org is a group of 250+ mostly tech entrepreneurs and VCs that meet monthly for a happy hour event.  Indyhall.org is one of the most successful coworking spaces out there.  IgnitePhilly was a huge success, with another one planned in the next couple of weeks.  phillytechhq.com is a blog aggregator of all the tech companies here (big + small).  The ""user group"" community is pretty huge too: <a href=""http://phillygroups.org/community/GroupDirectory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phillygroups.org/community/GroupDirectory</a><p>There are alot of universities that provide access to talent: Drexel, Penn/Wharton, Temple/Fox, etc.<p>Philly also has an awesome combination of art and American history that make it a wonderful place to live.

5757570,comment,5755226,5755226,1,0,geebee,,,"I enjoyed this essay immensely when it came out, and it's still worth discussion.<p>One thing that isn't discussed much [1] in this essay is the difference between <i>rent collection</i> and <i>wealth creation</i> (I wouldn't go quite so far as to say it's <i>missing</i>, which would imply that it should be there and isn't).<p>PG does conclude in this essay that on critical ingredient to encouraging wealth creation is allowing people who create wealth to keep (a lot of) it.  I do agree.  But looking back at the massive banking bailout (for instance), it's hard to avoid the conclusion that at least some of the massive fortunes were obtained through rent collection or even wealth destruction.  Even in Silicon Valley, there are issues as well.  The massive wealth of Microsoft was based heavily on leveraging a pretty aggressive monopoly - I've also read arguments that Facebook also occupies an incredibly profitable spot as a natural monopoly - earned fair and square, perhaps, but a monopoly nonetheless.<p>My guess is that everyone agrees that there is a mix of rent collecting and wealth creation - the real differences probably come in the extent to which people believe these two different activities occur.  If you believe that most of the fortunes in the US are based on highly creative wealth generation, you're probably at ease with inequality and low taxes.  If you believe that it is mainly rent collection, cartel and monopoly building, and an incestuous relationship with government, you probably aren't at ease with these things.<p>[1] It is mentioned, particularly in the first paragraph under wealth in power.  I'd be interested in reading a PG specifically devoted to the difference between rent collection and wealth generation, the extent to which this is a problem, and what we might do about it.",1369324790

The reason he sees few ""signs of solutionism"" is that specific solutions for these problems abound, the ""debate"" is over which is acceptable. The author enjoys living in a world where whomever expends the most effort repeating their viewpoint through mass media eventually wins ""political consensus"" and some centrally-dictated incremental change gets made for their favored direction. Of course if you're a professional journalist who is ultimately supported by vested interests that align with your views, this is a great world to live in.<p>The fact that something as amazingly straightforward to solve as gun ""control"" (hint: there's two very simple solutions) is <i>still and always</i> ""up for debate"" just shows the brokenness of that system. It's not particularly surprising that techies, having chosen <i>doing</i> instead of <i>talking</i> all their lives, want to focus on ways to move the world forward instead of expending energy on the quagmire of politics.<p>(Of course none of what I said is addressing the looming problem that this ""tech uber alles"" philosophy gets watered down and ends up letting hackers comfort themselves that technically-deficient but socially-popular centralized websites are empowering individuals rather than merely different masters, but that's a topic for a different day)",1369324785

I'm pretty darn good at that kind of stuff, but even so it took me several experiments over a period of weeks to get something I was happy with - and BTW it bears no resemblance at all to what the IT group thought would suffice.  Similarly, it pays to make sure that using test machines is as friction-free as possible, and that common tasks are automated as much as possible so that you don't have to keep watching/tweaking things from afar.  All good sense even if you're not remote, but even more important when you are.",1369323681

They're one indivisible thing with one icon and no hair.<p>Google's exploratory Failure is OK, Let The Users Figure It Out mentality is good too. It produces some really good stuff. But, for a lot of the things that google is trying to do, the ability to create really strong concepts is important. ""Packaged web app"" or ""chrome app"" or even ""web app"" are not clear concepts.

The first time I was asked to do fizzbuzz in an interview I got it wrong. It was about a year ago. I have been programming sine I was in middle school (I'm 29 now). Walking out of that interview was probably the worst day in my entire life.<p>Ever since then, two things have happened. First, the lines of fizzbuzz are forever etched into my mind. I can recite fizzbuzz verbally now. I don't even need any writing utensil. For i in xrange 1 comma 101 colon if i mod fifteen equals zero colon print ""fizzbuzz"" elif... [and so on]"". This has come in handy in interviews since. All you have to say is ""fizzbuzz"" and I go ahead and write away. I don't even need the interviewer to explain the actual wording of the problem.<p>And the second thing is that I now have absolutly zero interrest in hiring a company that has fizzbuzz (or any other live coding portion) as part of it's hiring process. If I'm at an interview and the interviewer tells me ""we're going to write code now"", I'm done. If the problem is interesting I'll do it, but if it's fizzbuzz or anything having to do with reinventing something, I'm done. Not gonna work there.<p>I've struggled to put into words how to describe why I think live coding is such a terrible thing to ask candidates during interviews. Joel Spolsky makes a great point thats hard to argue against. If you're hiring a guitar player, you want to hear him play. If you're hiring a programmer, you'd first want to see them write code. I think the problem is that programming is kind of more like song writing. You can't ask a song writer to go the white board and bang out a new song. Even if you tell him exactly what the song should be about. Song writing is a process, and so is programming.",1369322942

This makes testing a lot easier.<p>Only use routing ($route, $routeProvider) if your app has very little UI state and could reasonably thought of as several totally independent pages.  I switched to managing $location.path() explicitly and haven't looked back.<p>Embrace promises throughout your app.  Angular templates can now render promises naturally but I've found that I prefer to be more explicit:<p><pre><code>  $http.get(url).then(function(response) {
    $scope.something = response.data;
  }, function(error) {
    $scope.$emit('error', error);
  });

</code></pre>
Wrapping jquery widgets in directives often results in more code than just doing it yourself.  Obviously this increases your maintenance surface area but typically less than you would expect.<p>The Angular Bootstrap project is trying to create directives that avoid jquery and could be bound (with different templates) to other UI frameworks.  What I really want is a core set of UI widget directives and then separate (bootstrap or foundation inspired or not) CSS libraries for styling them.",1369322413

When I started learning web dev. using python, I started with Django. As I moved along trying to hack a simple side project using django, I realized that I was just not understanding the ""why"" of many things. For example, I tried to create a simple user registration and needed my own fields on the user object. Playing around with  User and User_Profile on django, I gave up after a few hours. When I came across Flask, I actually found it easier to do some of my own stuff to understand the whys and then i could always choose a vetted extension/plugin. For example, I wrote my own login system in flask and then switched to Flask-Login later. Btw, this is not about django vs flask but just giving a perspective as a newbie learner.<p>To newbies, my personal opinion is to understand the ""whys"" a lot more than just the ""what"".

(search for ""advice from best authors"" or ""daily routines of great writers"", etc, and you're bound to find many such articles. Some are good, most are puffery, but so it goes with anything).<p>Not all of the advice applies, of course, but there's a lot of good advice on making a good workspace and keeping yourself motivated. I've certainly noticed after working alone that there's a lot of implicit encouragement merely from working near other people, and this makes working at home harder than the same work might otherwise be. That's part of the reason why many prefer to work from cafes or worker/hacker-spaces, I think. Motivation is contagious.<p>(The positive flip side is that working from home removes a certain set of distractions that might otherwise be bothersome, and gives you more fine-grained control over the distractions you have in general).<p>Lots of authors use funny setups to transition from home-mode to work-mode. Some people build extra doors in their house so they can ""leave"" their house and ""enter"" an office that is sealed off from their house, but is otherwise the same building. One author (Roald Dahl?) worked from a bunker.<p>That being said, its probably a bad idea to get hung up on the idea of perfect working-from-home conditions. Per E. B. White:<p><i>""A writer who waits for ideal conditions under which to work will die without putting a word on paper.""</i><p>Some similar important words from Tchaikovsky, which I found especially relevant to working from home:<p><i>Do not believe those who try to persuade you that composition is only a cold exercise of the intellect. The only music capable of moving and touching us is that which flows from the depths of a composers soul when he is stirred by inspiration. There is no doubt that even the greatest musical geniuses have sometimes worked without inspiration. This guest does not always respond to the first invitation. We must always work, and a self-respecting artist must not fold his hands on the pretext that he is not in the mood. If we wait for the mood, without endeavouring to meet it half-way, we easily become indolent and apathetic. We must be patient, and believe that inspiration will come to those who can master their disinclination.</i><p>I think motivation is under-stated in its importance when it comes to working from home. Even if our work demands little distraction, we're social creatures, and we've probably all had days where its hard to even open up the editor.<p>It's important to stay positive and stay at it.

A couple of examples:<p>- Endless war-mongering.  They pushed heavily for the disastrous war in Iraq.  After the Boston bombing, they asked whether America was getting complacent.  They post a lot of stuff implying that America should go to war in Syria.<p>- Their coverage of American presidential politics is horrible.  In 2000, they endorsed George W Bush, a political scion who was clearly an anti-intellectual and bit of a fool, over Al Gore, a visionary vice president who had co-presided over the longest economic expansion in American history.  In 2004, after 4 disastrous years, their ""endorsement"" issue was titled ""Incompetent vs Incoherent"".<p>This stuff, especially the war-mongering, has made me care a lot less about the Economist than I did when I was, say, 18.

If there are two somewhat separable programs, but one is much more heavily used by the constituents that politicians care about, the privileged one will consistently enjoy an advantage in resource allocation decisions.  This eventually will cause them to be very unequal alternatives.<p>Also schools are in the habit of raising money from parents in a variety of ways.

It is massively complex because it must perform every UI task in the browser and simply moving around DIVs doesn't give you a feel for its the performance in complex scenarios.<p>If you think about how native applications perform and then imagine every one having to go through a DOM interface and every button and UI interaction being composed of DOM elements and re-styling these elements on every interaction  you get a sense of what the problem is. There is simply no way to get the DOM to do something it wasn't designed to do, which is to be a document display interface and not a general graphical user interface. You have to clobber together a lot of interactions to get the desired behavior and not only does this increase the overhead for both your program and the DOM you are going to hit cases where the DOM isn't optimized.<p>This doesn't mean that the DOM is inherently slow. If you tried to offload the UI work onto javascript you wouldn't get the performance benefit of doing that on Asm.js or NACL. You really need unsafe code to solve this problem. Asm.js and NACL are only useful if you are going to do this; targeting the Canvas and WebGL gives you the ability to do that.",1369322063

This requires a good understanding in what coding styles and data structures to avoid or pay extra attention to, but if you're aware of the pitfalls, it's actually not all that difficult. Just make sure your workers don't share any state, collect their outputs in a single thread-safe queue, use off the shelf components to represent threads, thread pools and locking mechanisms, be aware of things like multiple-read-single-write locks, and if you really can't avoid writes to shared state, only then start thinking about mutexes or semaphores. If you're smart about how you set up the code, more often than not you can get away with just some thread-safe queues. Take a look at Objective-C's block syntax and GCD for example, it makes maybe 90% of tasks suitable for multithreading dead easy.<p>Your estimate only 0.05% of programmers could write reliable multithreaded code is extremely pessimistic, cynical even. I almost feel flattered, having written a fair amount of multithreaded code that works perfectly myself, but I most definitely would dare count me with the 0.05% top programmers or whatever. My estimate is that with proper preparation, at least 50% of all programmers could learn to write reliable multithreaded code, and the remaining 50% probably wouldn't have a use for it anyway.",1369321949

So, write for yourself  and hold yourself to an appropriate standard, because youd better believe that others are judging the person as well as the piece  but as soon as you publish your views, youre inviting readers to take a look.""<p>Matt comes very close to one of my beliefs about writing... Creative writing is a way to give yourself an opportunity to think through an topic or story and give the rest of us an insight into how your mind works. That's the kind of writing I love -- the kind where I can see the gears moving to a certain degree and I know the author is honestly putting an effort into analyzing a subject or putting something difficult into words.<p>As an example, I think this is why the recent ""Hyperbole and a Half"" (<a href=""http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-par...</a>) about Allie's experiences with depression is so valuable and compelling.<p>And it's why I find listicles and articles that purport to be delivering glorious nuggets of truth from the top of Mount Bullshit to be boring, frustrating, and obnoxious. (If you look at my comment history, you'll probably find a fair amount of bitching about articles that are nothing but (often wrong or over-simplified) conclusions with no evident thought process behind them.)<p>I think it's actually something that's hard to fake. Like Matt says, your personality and opinions are integral. And it almost forces you to start writing about something you're not so sure about, which can seem uncomfortable. Because you might come to wrong conclusions. But if you write to edify yourself and to give yourself the chance to meditate and process the world around you, then suddenly sheer audience count will matter much less <i>and</i> (if you're a good thinker) you might find yourself writing much more compelling pieces, anyway, since, like I said, I think people appreciate being able to see the mental processes of another person at work.<p>So. I've diverged a bit from Matt's initial point, but his words made me think of this so I thought I'd share...<p>(Before someone else says it: No, I'm not talking about technical or instructional writing. That's different.)",1369321905

Whenever I visit my family, I have to constantly clean up junk from their PCs as they are not careful when installing stuff on Windows.<p>Hopefully Toolbar Blocker will help users keep the computers cleaner - it effortlessly prevents installation of toolbars (kind of like antivirus for toolbars). I am not sure about business model for this yet. Obviously I don't want to bundle anything, and I don't think people will want to pay for such a software.<p>Your comments would be very appreciated!<p>Here is the download site: http://www.toolbarblocker.com",1369321460

For personal use, I found it incredibly refreshing to use, even as bizarrely different as it was to anything else I've tried. Not in a bad way, but in the sense that it was more convention than I was used to (outside of Rails)<p>I would add that the Yeoman build manager is an absolute delight to structuring and managing your project. It was so slick that when making my first Angular app, I also ended up learning CoffeeScript to kill two birds at once...Yeoman made this otherwise prickly situation as smooth as possible.<p>And I also would agree that directives are Angular's killer feature...and unfortunately for me at the time, one of the hardest to grok because of their magic. Anyone writing an Angular tutorial would do a great service to emphasize the power and use cases for directives.",1369321335

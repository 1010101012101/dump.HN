There are also numerous examples of extremely popular bands releasing an album that is panned by critics, fans, or both (read: Metallica).  I agree with your parent post, every discipline involving art and talent is complex and difficult if you're interested in it and delve deep enough into it. It's just that programming gets a lot of attention on the Internet, especially Hacker News, but that's no surprise, is it?",1229190237

396798,comment,396596,396596,0,0,symptic,,,"This post and the video sickened me. I think everyone had good points, but the panel (people we're supposed to respect?) would yell and change topics when someone made an actual valid point.<p>The one comment about 'Americans need to appreciate life and Europeans need to work better' is the best argument in the entire video and it was looked over. Arrington is blind to say the Americans had the best stage presence. Le Meur was the most reasonable I think through the whole thing and he was cast aside. Why? Because he's french.<p>Seems to me the American panelists (Feldman aside) only see the world how they want to. There are great people everywhere, and the mentality they exhibited-focusing purely on winning and being efficient-shows their lack of comprehension into what matters most, both in life and business.<p>No matter how efficient you are or how much you want to win, it's important to have a level head to be able to step back and appreciate the things around you. Shoving your face in your work 12+ hours a day will make you miss half your life. I don't know about most of you guys, but I learn the most living life as compared to reading blogs and business articles.",1229189932

This works perfectly well so long as you know how diseased the cows are, and the odds of any one cow dying are independent from the next.  It's called math.<p>The actual <i>problem</i> with CDOs is that the cows were all more diseased than the historical track record suggested (because <i>after</i> they started putting together CDOs, a flawed incentive structure created a new motive to buy <i>sicker</i> cows) and that the probability of one cow dying wasn't independent of the next cow dying.",1229189055

396787,comment,396696,396696,0,0,windsurfer,,,"For any advanced techie, the three main reasons (Backup, sync, sharing) for using DropBox are irrelevant. For ordinary users: sure! It sounds like a great solution. Let me explain.<p>I don't think anyone with valuable data would trust their only backup with an external ""in-the-cloud"" source. On top of that, most people's upload capacity is severely limited.<p>Syncing is accomplished with rsync or a network share on your home network. Most geeks will SSH into their home computers, etc.<p>Sharing via drop box cannot be any better than a personally managed web server. GIT/SVN on your server offers much more than drop box can.<p>On the other hand, maybe I just like to hack and get my hands dirty creating my own solutions.",1229188996

396780,comment,394609,396742,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"You realize, of course, that to sit in modern Germany alive and well (and being able to speak freely) is the result of two world wars, a cold war, a dozen or so continental wars (including ones that gave you religious freedom) countless invasions and counterinvasions by various tribes, the Romans seeking to pacify the Germanic tribes -- the limit of this list is simply the limits of our written record. Most all of these conflicts were fought ""wrongly"" according to your standards, because they involved torture and mass killings.<p>Your supposition is that somehow modern life would have come about without all of this dirty armed conflict. Since it did, in fact, happen the other way, the onus is on you to explain how all of this magic would work. I'm simply reporting to you that by your own standards you should still be living in a tribe in the woods somewhere.<p>Wars in many cases have different outcomes than the victors imagine. That's a non-sequiter, however, in that as 3-dimensional beings we are forced to make our best judgments and go forward. I'm not making an ""ends justify the means"" argument. I'm stating that the means must take into consideration what the ultimate ends will be for the human race, not just dither around about aspects of violence. Sometimes we get it wrong, sure, but that doesn't relieve us of our responsibility to think for more than just ourselves.<p>My personal morals say that I should never torture or kill. But I have a greater obligation to mankind than to myself. If forced, I have an obligation to my species that overrules the obligation I have to my conscience. It <i>is</i> better to die than violate one's personal morals, but it is better to violate one's personal morals than to let mankind perish. I am not the center of the moral universe.<p>That's some hard logic. Thanks for your response.",1229188213

Full disclosure: I work at Rackspace, but I <i>honestly</i> believe that Cloud Servers + Cloud Database (hosted MySQL) at Rackspace is vastly superior choice for a reasonably large number of projects/products than AWS.<p>IMO, the perfect setup for most non-Facebook sized money-making web apps is nearly always dedicated SSD-powered database hardware connected to a cheap cloud of virtual boxes to serve requests. Spending engineering $$$ on scaling your data across unreliable virtual instances <i>often</i> is not a good idea.<p>Going all-dedicated, if you can afford it, is great for pretty good uptime at zero engineering cost. I recommend SoftLayer for this: they sell cheap and reliable dedicated servers connected to pretty good networks (just stay away from their older Dallas-based DCs, but DC5 is good).",1361915919

5288932,comment,5284627,5284627,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"From someone who is writing a game in his spare time, this looks promising, but not something that I will consider using.<p>* First, I am put off by the choice of a proprietary language. I can tell you right away that I am not going to use it, not ever. A proprietary language just won't cut it these days. Sure, Lua has its problems, but they are not big enough to warrant inventing your own ActionScript clone, in my opinion.<p>* Secondly, the front page says I can ignore LoomScript if I like, but it doesn't suggest what the alternative would be. I assume that it means writing directly to the C++ framework? If so, that's a crappy alternative. The attraction of engines like Moai is precisely that the scripting experience should so good that you could, up to a certain threshold of complexity, write an entire game without ever dipping into C++.<p>* Thirdly, I tried to find the API documentation, but apparently this requires me to not only download Loom, but install it. It's really important for me to have online docs I can browse anywhere without jumping through hoops to get it.<p>* Fourthly, the web site is <i>very</i> light on details. The Features page is very vague. It has a ""gameplay framework"", which I don't know what is. From the descriptions it's unclear exactly what Loom brings to the table; does it have support isometric games? Is it a scene graph engine? What about building 2D meshes, layers, asset loading, custom shaders, file formats, sound/audio?<p>From the vague description it <i>looks</i> like Loom is ""just"" some glue for tying various libraries together, centered on Cocos2Dx with LoomScript bindings -- unlike, say, Moai, which is an engine written from scratch that integrates some external libraries (Box2D and so on), but all abstracted through its own native API.<p>* Lastly, I didn't download it because the web site requires me to sign up. I just wanted to explore the code, not sign up for a license, so that's off the table.<p>I am currently on Moai. I don't love the APIs, I'm not a fan of Lua, and I was forced into writing C++ code way sooner than I expected (not a problem, but it's for fairly trivial stuff that Moai should have provided in the first place, and only because Lua is too slow at maths/vector stuff). On the other hand, Moai is free, open source, well-documented (with online docs), fairly mature, fast, has good APIs, an active community, and Moai Cloud (the hosted backend system) is reasonably priced.<p>In other words, I like Moai but I'm only something like 80% happy with it; it would not be terribly hard to entice me to switch to something better. If someone hacked up an engine on par with Moai, with slightly richer 2D features and a better language (Ruby! JavaScript/CoffeeScript with a JIT-based VM like V8 would also work) and a better physics engine, I would probably switch in a heartbeat. Superficial things like live reload I don't care much about.<p>Just my thoughts. I don't expect they are representative of game devs in general, although I suspect you will find that the choice of language will be a point of contention among more experienced devs.",1361915871

  Immigration is one that others have mentioned.  Here in the US it can be fairly difficult (not impossible though) to hire a programmer from outside of the country if they do not have any academic credentials.
  You can certainly build a portfolio of released software that can generate as many or more opportunities than a degree, but it is easier to understand exactly how to accomplish a university degree and how much effort it will take.  It might be harder than you think to build a great portfolio.
  The signaling value of a degree is fairly well understood.  You are communicating your intelligence and some measure of what kinds of things you can accomplish in a very easy to understand way by getting a degree.
  But honestly, from my point of view if you release a bunch of software, find users, and make them happy you will be far ahead of anyone who only has a degree (in terms of being interesting to recruit).  I think lots of people think a degree will solve this for them, but education is just a start.
  Also, it's worth mentioning that I quite enjoyed getting my degree.  It sounds like you aren't excited about it, but going to college is a really fun set of experiences for many people.  After having done it, I think it was worth doing just for those experiences.",1361915113

Sure, you can have a web app and then a separate API for mobile clients, but why not just have a RESTful interface that can be used by all of them?<p>This doesn't necessarily mean that you can't still do server-side views if you wanted to. But by separating the view rendering from the service layer you provide a bit more flexibility. Designed correctly, the argument becomes moot. Either you're creating a controller, models, and event callbacks on the server, or you're creating them on the client.

Gold is not currency outside of a few niches because people just hoard it.  Gold was replaced by other currencies as soon as people discovered reliable ways to prevent counterfeiting.<p>""If you rephrase your statements using words ""buying"" and ""selling"",""<p>...then you wind up with the same problem.  Here is a simple example for you:  suppose an enormously wealthy person decided to buy all the gold in the world, and keep it locked in his cellar.  What would gold be worth once everyone realized that there was none left to buy?  People would eventually forget that they ever wanted gold once there was none left to buy.<p>Let's put it this way:  Livermorium is one of the rarest materials in the universe.  How much would you be willing to trade for a gram of it?<p>Now, with Bitcoin, things actually become simpler.  Gold has industrial uses, and Lv might also.

No, because people are still willing to buy.""<p>People are only willing to buy currency if the currency has utility.  Nobody buys gold as currency anymore because it is not currency (again, try to use it at a vending machine; for that matter, try to find a merchant who even has a scale available to weigh gold), they buy it as an investment, and only when they have a supply of some other currency available to them.<p>""Please point out logical problems in my statement""<p>Right here:<p>""When a single seller expects that the price will not grow further""<p>1.

I suppose the difference is in scope and scale.<p>Someone passively resisting a bad law can certainly be said to not be a vigilante; they're not actively trying to to bring about their desired brand of justice, they are simply refusing to comply with the current legal version of it.<p>One would not expect to bring out change only by themselves via civil disobedience, it's power comes from being applied across a group of people. Vigilante justice is different; you simply fix whatever situation is unjust.<p>If Aaron had simply complied with his own manifesto (e.g. downloading an article at a time, organizing others to download articles, etc.) I think we could safely say he was simply being civilly disobedient.<p>But he kicked it up a notch. He used technology to speed up his extraction of the entire JSTOR database. He evaded network blocks in the process. When he finally could go no farther on Wifi he hooked his computer directly within the assumed-safe MIT subnet. In short, civil disobedience was taking too long for him and he decided to escalate.<p>So even if one agrees substantially with his desire for open access I hope it is understandable why people might disagree with his methods, and furthermore to understand why the legal system would disagree. We as a society have deliberately chosen to punish vigilantism because it breeds a world where justice applies only to those strong enough to enforce their worldview.<p>Although Aaron was not physically violent he certainly had a leg up on 99.9% of the rest of the U.S. population with regard to ""cyberskills"", does he not? If I stole a million cars and returned them without a scratch to their rightful owner in order to achieve some desirable positive goal I would still get in trouble, because I am not Caesar and therefore don't get to decide which laws do and do not apply to me (however virtuous I might be as a person).<p>We can debate about misdemeanor or felony, whether 3 months of prison or no jail time at all is appropriate but people seem to be shocked and amazed that the legal system would have taken an interest <i>at all</i> in this case, and I just don't understand why people think that.",1361914105

This is really pretty!<p>The stated use case for this is ""transactional messages in your app."" For that I think it fits pretty well. It might work as a debugging utility, similar to how we used alert() before we had console.log(), but it seems like the intended use case is for an end-user-facing interface.<p>Two minor gripes: 
1) Backbone as a dependency for a UI element is kind of overkill.
2) This is more of a pet peeve, but why is the demo written in Coffeescript? I love Coffeescript and use it all the time, but I think it makes more sense for something like this to be demoed in Javascript.

Aaron didn't accept a plea deal, and he didn't have to if he didn't want to.<p><i>He was legally entitled to make the copies that he made; the alleged intent is the sole basis for even supposing any crime existed.</i><p>This is false. Look at the charge sheet and look at the law cited. Many people seem to have this misconception, but the law doesn't say ""it's a crime to intend to do this"", it says ""it is a crime to do this thing with the intent to do this other thing"". Both the things he did and the intent that was alleged are part of the accusation, and both would have have to been proven to the standards of ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" if it had gone to trial. If the prosecution could not meet that standard for his actions (i.e. if they could not show that he was not legally entitled to do the downloading the way he did), he would have been found not guilty as well.<p>The point being: the alleged intent is <i>not</i> the sole basis for the charge.",1361912937

2) No one forced him to do it.

The bind is best in terms of memory and simplicity, but will not run on on IE 8 or crappier, so in that case #2 is preferred.<p>The last one creates anon functions needlessly, but is very compact to write.",1421783998

8919110,comment,8917045,8917780,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"I feel like this is just another variant on the utility argument, though. You feel the SSC would have been more useful to scientific research than the ISS. But there is still the argument to be made that we don&#x27;t know in advance what knowledge will be more useful. Maybe in the future, it will turn out that we really need to know how to keep humans alive in space, but the Higgs is useless for all practical purposes.<p>But--what I just said is still the argument from utility!<p>As the GP pointed out, we pay for all sorts of things that have little directly measurable utility, like fireworks and parks and the arts. Yes, towns with good fireworks, parks, and arts will have an advantage in attracting good companies and employees. And I&#x27;d say the same is true of space exploration (it helps the U.S. reputation). But once again, we&#x27;re into utility.<p>Why do those things create advantage in the first place? Because people like those things. So turn the utility argument on its head and consider: things have high utility because they allow us to do things that we like.<p>Now consider that exploration is itself popular. Whether it&#x27;s diving to the Mariana Trench, free climbing a new route on El Cap, or flying to orbit on the Space Shuttle, these are stories that many people love to read, and kids love to dream about.<p>So I would argue that space exploration can skip the utility argument altogether...we do it because we like it--directly. The purpose of exploration is to explore. This is behind quite a bit of the history of science as well: people exploring places and phenomena simply because it was so interesting to do it.<p>Edit to add: this sort of reasoning can make fans of science uncomfortable because it&#x27;s not a logical or scientific argument. But the fact is that emotions like awe, excitement, etc. are often big reasons that kids begin to pursue careers in science. Not many 18 years olds start on a physics degree because of a deep-seated desire to add 0.01% to future GDP.",1421783871

8919091,comment,8916993,8917893,0,0,leo_pekelis,,,"While I do agree that a sequential hypothesis test like the one we implemented in Stats Engine is different than a completely Bayesian method, I wouldn’t necessarily call it less powerful. In fact, numerous optimality properties exist showing that a properly implemented sequential test minimizes the expected number of visitors needed to correctly reject a null hypothesis of zero difference. I should note that our particular implementation does use some Bayesian ideas as well.<p>I agree that a benefit of Bayesian analysis is flexibility. Different posterior results are possible with different priors. But in practice this can be a hindrance as well as a benefit. When answer depend on a choice of prior, misusing, or misunderstanding the prior can lead to incorrect conclusions.<p>There is also a very attractive feature of Frequentist guarantees specifically for A/B testing. They make statements on the long-run average lift, which is a quantity that many businesses care about: what will my average lift be if I implement a variation after my A/B test?<p>That said, we have, and continue to look at Bayesian methods because we don’t feel that we have to be in either a Frequentist or Bayesian framework, but rather use the tools that are best suited to answer the sorts of statistical questions our customers encounter.<p>Finally, there have been some very interesting results lately on the connections between sequential testing and bandits!

8919081,comment,8916993,8918280,0,0,leo_pekelis,,,"I do agree with you that with sequential testing it is possible to get much slower results. This is actually similar to using a sample size calculator for a classical t-test. If you set your minimum detectible effect (MDE) much smaller than the actual effect size of your A/B test, you will end up waiting for many more visitors than were needed to detect significance. We have looked at many historical A/B tests at Optimizely to determine the range of effect sizes which give the most efficiency for our customers. In fact, we didn’t put out Stats Engine sooner because we wanted to be confident that the speed was comparable to the usual, fixed horizon, t-test. This tuning will be part of an ongoing process to customize results at the customer level.<p>Second, I want to point out that Stats Engine is not a Bayesian test. We do not recompute a posterior from past information after every visitor and use this directly to get significance. Instead such calculations are used as inputs to determine how much information we have compared to a situation of zero effect size. There’s only ‘one lense’ still because we use all this to make and guarantee the usual Frequentist hypothesis testing statements, but now factoring in that an experimenter can look at results at any time.",1421783655

It is 1 minus the chance of committing a type I error. I think you do point out an important nuance that under sequential testing a type I error changes to “ever detecting a significant result on an insignificant test” instead of just at one, predetermined visitor count.<p>The amount of accumulated evidence for X is exactly a p-value, or a measurement which can tell you if there is enough evidence in the experiment to contradict a hypothesis of “no difference between a baseline and variation.” A high p-value, or low significance tells you there is a lack of evidence to make this claim.<p>You bring up a very interesting point which is that with sequential testing it is actually possible to also look for evidence of ‘not X’ or that there really is no detectable difference. This works by ‘flipping the hypothesis test on it’s head’ and allows for a mathematical formulation of stopping early for futility.

8919041,comment,8917989,8918234,0,0,angersock,,,"I&#x27;m kind of doing that right now--we&#x27;ve got that issue pretty badly, actually. It&#x27;s surmountable, but annoying.<p>Here are some observed causes or environmental factors:<p><i>Using an older or low-level language</i>. If you&#x27;re doing code in asm/C/C++/Matlab/Fortran (arguably Perl, PHP), odds are you aren&#x27;t in a position to easily pull in other people&#x27;s solutions. That means that you are probably trying to reinvent the wheel, because you don&#x27;t know of a pre-existing solution, because you don&#x27;t want to pull in the massive baggage of other solutions, or because you enjoy making the wheel over again yourself. Newer, more abstract languages don&#x27;t have this problem, mostly I think because they come from a time of easy collaboration via the internet. The whole gem/npm/hex ecosystems simply couldn&#x27;t be possible without easy internet access and github. I&#x27;m going to call out C++ specifically here, because using that language with old code is terrible because odds are that, even if you are doing things correctly, the library author isn&#x27;t (from a strict software engineering standpoint).<p><i>Not understanding your problem space</i>. Oftentimes, being overly conservative about your design requirements (we must be webscale, fault tolerant, absolutely <i>have</i> to support XYZ vendor integration) means that you overdesign--and when you do that, you are more likely to be fighting old wars. If you really grok and have cleanly defined your problem space, you know where you can cut corners, instead of overbuilding based on previous experience.<p><i>Not following de facto standards</i>. There&#x27;s a bajillion ISO standards for everything you might want, and a lot of people will glibly explain &quot;The great thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from&quot;. The problem is, those people will either go on to ignore standards in favor of their own (usually created to fight the last war), or pick one that isn&#x27;t being used (usually something that is fighting a war that was already won/lost). The only thing worse than fighting the last war is fighting the last war from the losing side. JSON vs XML is a great example of this, as is RFC3339 vs ISO8601 vs <insert wrong in-house way of doing time here>. Another great example is REST vs SOAP, or Unix Way vs Not Unix Way, or ORM vs Not ORM.<p><i>Not being lazy</i>. The best wars are never fought, right? There&#x27;s nothing worse than a developer who is super industrious and never pauses to think &quot;Wait, is the problem I&#x27;m solving just a rehash of something I&#x27;ve done before, or is there a deeper conflict here?&quot;. Fighting the last war happens when these people continually reiterate on the last battle (&quot;This time I&#x27;ve got time right!&quot;, &quot;This time I&#x27;ve got better performance!&quot;, &quot;This time I&#x27;ve got the right object model!&quot;), all the while missing the important thing (&quot;My customer still can&#x27;t do X&quot;).<p><i>Not sharing knowledge</i>. Probably the biggest one of these other than the previous one is the problem of developers not letting other developers know about what&#x27;s been tried before, and why it did or did not work. We already hate rehashing solutions--so if presented with a module that isn&#x27;t explained, are you going to rewrite it, or just accept it? Almost all the developers I know would prefer to rewrite it (and only experience and wisdom holds them back from doing so). When you&#x27;ve got a large codebase, and you&#x27;ve got like three different exception handling systems built by different groups because they don&#x27;t talk, you&#x27;ve fought the last war three times.",1421783293

One of those things that, once you&#x27;ve seen it, pops up again and again. A reason I like Javascript as a language.<p>It is having three layers of instantiation.<p>Typically in a data-driven game engine you have some base class that handles the behavior of, say, a collectible. (In a modern engine this would be a component, rather than a base class).<p>Then you load data and instantiate a number of those components for different types of collectible: health, powerup, etc.<p>Then you instantiate those for a specific collectible (the health pack at location X,Y,Z in level A).<p>That doesn&#x27;t map elegantly onto the class/instance dichotomy. The mapping is tricky enough that there are different ways of doing it: you can have a different kind of class in the middle layer that acts as a factory for your third layer instances; you can have an &#x27;archetype&#x27; mechanism, where instances at the second level are copied to make instances at the third; or you make instances at the third level have a reference to their &#x27;type&#x27; (instances at the second) and delegate queries through to them. There are many other approaches.<p>But that three layer data-driven problem goes away when you can just inherit as many times as you like.<p>In most large game engines, there is a poorly architected buggy version of prototypical inheritance.",1421783184

1. Five star rating systems by themselves contain such little information that they are basically pointless. If there&#x27;s a critical mass of ratings, then they can be somewhat useful. Yelp is a 5 star system, but without the ability to skim a handful of reviews written by other users, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as useful. 
2. The system presented in this post might work ok for one&#x27;s personal ecosystem, but as soon as I strayed into a new city where my contacts were 0 to a few, the utility of this service would rapidly decline. 
3. For all their pitfalls, Yelp and Google reviews do a decent enough job at enabling discovery, especially when users take into account the amount of reviews for an establishment, the specific area they&#x27;re searching in, and the specific search term they&#x27;ve entered. Sure, there are fake reviews, astroturfers, and gaming going on, but it&#x27;s not too hard for a trained eye to filter these things out.",1421783162

To achieve this, the page will probably contain a SQL query with a &#x27;name&#x27; field. If the inputs are not properly sanitized, the field can contain anything including SQL code.

Decorations (handles and such) would be the first to vary, then dimensions, then materials then the actual design of the business bit and finally the process.<p>> If we&#x27;re talking about something that qualifies as the same type of tool or weapon, OK.<p>Exactly.<p>> If we&#x27;re talking about something with extremely similar metallurgical qualities, size, design, age, etc., then it&#x27;s likely a little more than just &quot;well, it&#x27;s an x made of y found at z, they&#x27;re all the same.&quot;<p>No, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect.

There&#x27;s plenty of other VCs, but they are not substitute products for Ronco.<p>Finally, the way to find these unique, priceless features is to look for extremes:<p><pre><code>    - Cloud hosting with not just 99.99% uptime, but 100% uptime
    - Email inboxes with not just a lot of storage, but *unlimited* storage
    - Photos developed not just faster, but *instantly*
    - A VC with not just a great track record of doing the right thing, but a *perfect* record

At some point the community split and people from Mozilla, Apple and Google (I think) formed WHATWG to pursue a different (and faster) direction which is where HTML5 was formed, then later adopted back by the W3C.<p>One of the issues at the time when people pushed for wide XHTML adoption was that most people served pages as text/html which was basically wrong.<p>Serving pages as application/xhtml+xml triggered the XML parser instead of the HTML parser which is the &quot;proper&quot; way to parse XHTML.<p>The problem some people ran into was that the XML parser is way less lenient than the HTML parser. You _have_ to close your tags, you _have_ to escape entities, and if you had a single mistake anywhere in your markup the browser would render an error page instead of working around it.<p>There were also issues with in-lining JavaScript and having to wrap it in a CDATA block to stop the XML parser from attempting to parse it.<p>This was a headache for sites with user generated content and people in general seemed to not like the idea of having to clean their markup for what some perceived as very little gain.<p>Anyway, long story short, HTML5 won, XHTML didn&#x27;t.",1421780838

8918746,comment,8916993,8918063,0,0,dargani123,,,"Hey guys,<p>Answering addressing a few comments right here. I think the industry deserves a lot of credit in its efforts to help those wanting to run A/B tests. Many people were aware these were issues and many actually tried to fix it (us included). There are many blog posts in the community about why continuous monitoring is dangerous, why you should use a sample size calculator, how to properly set a Minimum Detectable Effect etc... We were part (and definitely not the first) of this group as we published a sample size calculator and spent a lot of time working with our clients on running tests with a safe testing procedure.<p>However, after doing this and looking more closely attempting to quantify the effect of these efforts we saw an opportunity for a simpler solution that could help even more people. Sequential Testing was this solution, and it&#x27;s had success in other applications. We wanted to bring sequential testing to A/B testing and take the hard work out of doing it correctly. Specifically, we have built on that groundwork laid in 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s by providing an always valid notion of p-value that customers are looking for.<p>While traditional sequential testing combats the continuous monitoring problem well, they require you to have an intimate understanding of the solution that can pose cognitive hurdles for those not well-versed in statistics. You have to either know your target effect size, or have in mind a maximum allowable number of visitors and understand how changes in these will affect the run time of your test. What’s more, it is not straightforward to translate results to standard measures of significance such as p-values. This is actually where the biggest research contribution of Stats Engine comes in. We allow you to run a test, detect a range of effect sizes and provide an always valid FDR-adjusted p-value as opposed to a set of stopping rules that bounds Type 1 error at say 5%. The error rates are valid no matter how the user chooses to interact with the A/B test. Also, FDR control itself has only been around over the last 20-25 years.<p>Our biggest industry contribution is probably much simpler in us moving a lot of the market to sequential testing more generally. We are happy to be in the position to help build on research and bring this to practical applications.",1421780468

You <i>could</i> set up your own email server, but doing so in such a way that you don&#x27;t harm your ability to get emails into people&#x27;s inboxes is problematic in all sorts of ways: you&#x27;ve got a good chance of being classified as spam. So even though the system is decentralized, the fact that most users are centralized within a few big players means that those parties can unilaterally impose rules that cut off users who don&#x27;t participate in the centralized ecosystem.<p>In short: if Coinbase becomes sufficiently large, they could have the de facto power to disadvantage people who choose to use bitcoin outside of major centralized services.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that a system can&#x27;t tend more or less to centralization: sure, it can, and Bitcoin could have a strong tendency to make unilaterally enforced centralization hard.

(and btw he's commenting on Mossberg's review so he's not out any money)<p>The criticism that Microsoft would do well to reign in their OEMs putting crapware on their offerings is well taken. But understand that Microsoft got convicted of being a monopolist by being pretty aggressive telling OEMs what they could and could not put on the machines they were selling. If I were Microsoft I would err on the side of not pissing off the Justice department and let the market sort it out.<p>And by and large if you have purchased a laptop from an OEM with Windows pre-installed in the last 5 years you've noticed that it has a lot of crap on it, and those are 250GB and 500GB drives. So I am hard pressed to believe that any buyer today, given the 'small' size of 128GB of storage, would have <i>any</i> expectation that even half of that would be available without doing a lot of work.",1353217990

4799979,comment,4799017,4799742,2,0,001sky,,,"Not sure this makes sense. The example of leveraged loans is quite distinct from residential mortages, for example. Also, the credit risk of the latter is pawned off onto the federal gov't in the US. Either way, banks should be banks. They should be taking the risk they underwite.  Shares and bonds are a slightly different animal than asset backed secured loans, but they are now essentially all treated alike: things to pawn off with zero net book exposure. Investment banks structured as partnerships also had downside risk -- that is one of the main structural differences in a legal sense -- and that also should not be overlooked.

4799971,comment,4799695,4799816,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, great discussion and yes I do understand the 'its in the spec why can't I use it' feeling. For disks its pretty straightforward to ""see"" the consumption and for other things (like RAM) you don't get a clear idea of how much RAM you get to use for your applications vs all the other things hogging RAM [0][1].<p>Of course in specmanship you can't speak truth when your competitors don't right? So you can't advertise this as ""xxGB of disk space"" which accurately reflects the amount available to the user any more than you can say 700 Mhz of available CPU power is yours to command. This because brand Y will tell you all of the GB on the disk since that will get them some sales for people who don't read the label closely and are doing number + unit to number + unit comparisons.<p>When I worked at NetApp the customers would say ""Gee you've got n x yyyGB drives in there, how come I don't get that much storage?"" And the answer was well there are RAID parity data, OS overhead, snapshots, Etc. Never a very satisfying conversation because they always believe you give them more space if you ""tried harder"". And the sad thing is <i>that</i> is true, but what wasn't true is that the customer would accept the cost increase of the extra engineering to make it so.<p>I'm amazed at the changes that dirt cheap magnetic storage has wrought. I've been cleaning out my 'junk box' to make a donation to the Hacker Dojo and came across some speed matched 8MB DIMMs. Yup four speed matched DIMMs for a robust 32MB of memory. About the only thing they are good for, if you're not into 'old' computers, is perhaps geeky jewelry.<p>The Manual of the Yoga 13 [2] indicates there are 256GB and 512GB disks available, since it didn't look like any of the partitions scaled with storage size (restore partition for example just has to be big enough to hold release images) you can add more space by adding money.<p>So I totally understand how disappointing it is to see half the drive or more consumed by unknown stuff, but on a larger system that would be a quarter or an eighth of the drive. And I'm sensitive to the 'my laptop is my only machine' argument too (although the natural backup feature of having two machines should not be overlooked!) it is that we've arrived here on the back of super cheap spinning rust, and SSDs don't have quite the economies that rust does.<p>[0] Not a new issue, see CP/M 80 system advertisements bragging about how much ""TPA"" you got.<p>[1] And yes you can run atop(1), Taskmanager, Etc and see how much you're being given access too, but I haven't read much outrage over that at the moment.<p>[2] <a href=""http://download.lenovo.com/consumer/mobiles_pub/ideapad_yoga13_hmm_1st_edition_oct_2012_english.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://download.lenovo.com/consumer/mobiles_pub/ideapad_yoga...</a>",1353217348

4799964,comment,4798791,4799451,2,0,geofft,,,"The usual complaint regarding systemd is about its extensive and fundamental use of cgroups for process group tracking. There is nothing in the POSIX standard that offers a feature similar to cgroups -- a simple example is to track all processes spawned by a given child process (or by anything it in turn spanws), and be able to kill them all, even if that particular child process terminates early. So any implemention of this feature, whether or not it uses Linux cgroups, must be independent of what's specified in POSIX.<p>POSIX standardizes approximately nothing relating to sound, so the same problem is there too for PulseAudio. Nor does it standardize anything about devices being added or removed, so there's no standard API covering udev or some other hotplug solution.<p>One argument you could make is that Linux should offer no features that are not standardized in POSIX. I bet that would not make many developers or users happy, though.",1353217011

With that in mind, I will also explicitly say I don't even disagree with your conclusion: I just feel that there is a misconception about jailbreaking that should be corrected that is causing the argument to not really follow all the way through to the conclusion. In the end, I still agree that Apple already has the control they need in this scenario, and the suggested solutions in the article would not cause them any challenges in that regard.)<p>The percentage of people jailbreaking their iPhone over time has not really fallen, excepting of course times when we don't have a current jailbreak (like now, but that rebounds quickly when we do as the demand is latent and pounces); I wouldn't even call it small, as it hovers upwards of 10%: of the hundreds of millions of active devices Apple has out there, tens of millions of them are jailbroken (and yes: they are often current devices; the people most likely to want the absolute newest device constantly are also the people most likely to want even more out of it and thereby jailbreak).<p>That said, that isn't really relevant: jailbreaking has nothing at all to do with the device testing limit on applications because jailbreaking isn't really about applications: it is about all of the little modifications we make to existing software using my Substrate library... the default repositories in Cydia actually carry an insignificant number of ""applications"" (something that could be installed with a developer certificate) in comparison to the number of Substrate extensions. If you told me tomorrow that everyone in the world could now get infinite developer certificate access, we in the jailbreak community would say ""so what? that doesn't help us"" and continue with business as usual.",1353216870

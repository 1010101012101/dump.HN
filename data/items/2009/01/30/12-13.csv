I mean sure it might help you identify some middle class families trends but thats about it<p>Based on that data an average minter makes at least $4,100 x 12 * 1.33(to account for taxes) = $65,436...and thats specific spending, who knows what % of their income gets saved or invested.<p>So thats the 10% or so of the population who are well off, what about all those people making less than 70-80K?",1233319973

Perhaps it was just the way it was taught in secondary school, altho' I was good at it there didn't seem to be much point. Then they taught us linear programming and it was literally mind-expanding. Suddenly a whole class of things I couldn't even think about before was opened up before me. The question is, how can that moment be experienced younger, by people who don't already have an A-level (or high school diploma, whatever you call it).",1233319551

It is, honest.  We just need to figure out how to convey that.  And if you don't think it is, you haven't found the fun bits.<p>OK, it doesn't suit everyone.

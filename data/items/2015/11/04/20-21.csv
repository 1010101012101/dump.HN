Or do they mean as a pure transport format? In which case... Who &quot;likes&quot; these kind of things? I might have strong feelings about endianness (LE just doesn&#x27;t feel natural) or stupid bases like 10, but a mediocre serialization format?<p>And it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that Haskell users dislike thing. Once you use a superior language, you really realize how much things suck. People warn about this in jest: don&#x27;t learn <fp lang> because you&#x27;ll hate working in other languages. But it&#x27;s quite real and true. After being in a high level language with a good type system, working in a &quot;mainstream&quot; language is like trying to explain stuff to a subpar 6-yr-old. It&#x27;s just incredibly frustrating.<p>(Working with one customer that chose C for their large codebase due to performance... Except the incredible verbosity ended up hiding terrible algorithms, and the lack of abstraction means changing things is a huge undertaking. Or on C# projects, every 5 lines of code I write I realise how it&#x27;d only be one in F#. Or how a long-standing bug would not have been possible due to more sane compiler checks.)",1446670793

You raise it, because suddenly there&#x27;s a group of so-so engineers who now can&#x27;t get a job just because they&#x27;re white.<p>If that feels uncomfortable, replace &quot;white&quot; with &quot;MIT student&quot;. Or any other in-group.<p>If you almost exclusively hire from a single group, at some point just being part of that group makes it easier for you to get a job.<p>As far as I can tell, nobody is asking for hiring quotas based on profile. What people are asking for is an equal chance.<p>For pretty much any group that&#x27;s not white/asian male, tech has an issue. The percentage of the minority group in the general demographic is higher than the percentage of people in that group graduating. The percentage of graduates is higher than the percentage of people hired. The percentage of people hired is higher than the percentage of people promoted.<p>All this diversity thing is asking for is that we take a look <i>why</i> the percentages are decreasing.<p>E.g. for black people: They&#x27;re 12% of the general work force. 4.5% of CS bachelors are black. 2% of SV tech employees are black. 1% of Fortune-500 CEOs are black.<p>There&#x27;s constant attrition going on, while the number of the main demographic increases as you go up the ladder. (This general relationships hold for other minorities as well, but I don&#x27;t have numbers handy right now)<p>That&#x27;s what diversity asks for - stop the steady attrition of anybody who&#x27;s not in the majority group.",1446670791

It is very expensive to raise a family while complying with US rules. You can have your children taken away if you fail to comply with any of that. Many illegal immigrants shortcut through that issue by leaving their families behind and living like frugal single men. Even those that immigrate as full families are already used to breaking the rules, and since they already face deportation if caught they do not fear doing without with &quot;necessities&quot; like cars, up-to-code housing, child care, etc.<p>3. Communities matter a lot. Poor citizens are every man for his own more often than not.

Currently we track them, but don&#x27;t use them.<p>Confession regarding images/colors/contrasts/etc: neither of us are UI people. It is something we struggle with, so doubly appreciate the feedback here. Will try to improve this soon.<p>Regarding some missing links to reddit, are there good threads on reddit we should be linking to for them, or has reddit just not picked them up? Our algorithms try to find every related reddit thread to a story, although they can make mistakes.<p>Regarding autofollowing all defaults -- it&#x27;s tricky. We used to do this, and got feedback that people didn&#x27;t link having to unfollow a bunch of topics when they created an account. Exactly how to package the experience is an open question, one that is complicated by the desire to have a good logged-out experience that transitions as smoothly to the logged-in experience as possible. Point being, you hit on a good issue here that we don&#x27;t yet have a perfect answer to.<p>&#x27;Since last visit&#x27; time range sounds neat. Will look into adding.<p>Re: star ratings -- manually ordering articles (this should rank above that) or having up/down arrows for each article are also natural ways to provide ranking feedback. A big concern of ours here is the ability for a user to have a clean mental model of their own feedback over a long period of time. For example, feedback in the form of up/down arrows comes necessarily in the context of a specific set of articles shown at a specific time. If someone wants to review their feedback in aggregate, it might be difficult to represent it all in one place in a way that&#x27;s easy to understand. On the other hand, your criticism of it is also correct. Adding additional ways to make training data, or changing how we do this, is something we are really interested in getting right.",1446669217

10509461,comment,10505349,10505349,0,0,Animats,,,"About ten years earlier, in 1970, at Chi Corporation (a spinoff of CWRU) in Cleveland, I used the prototype Harris Intertype phototypesetter.  We were one floor below the Harris Intertype Printing Equipment Research Center, and they&#x27;d built the first CRT-based phototypesetter.  It had a custom CRT one line high and about 12 inches wide, which wrote letters onto photographic paper.  The photographic developer, with rollers and tanks of chemicals was built into the machine, so it emitted developed pages.  The machine was its own darkroom, with a door so that people could walk inside.  This was the prototype of what became the Harris 7000.<p>Input was via a magnetic tape drive, and fonts were sequences of strokes. \nJohn Langner at Chi wrote a program called Procrustes, which took in fonts in some grid format and turned them into a sequence of vectors.  There was no need for reverse engineering; this was done with full cooperation from Harris Intertype. There was also a primitive markup language and layout program, all text-driven. All this ran on an UNIVAC 1108 mainframe. Tapes were written on the mainframe and carried to the phototypesetter. The end result was quite good.  I still have some manuals printed from its masters.<p>We also had the first electrostatic printer, built by Clevite/Brush Instruments.[1]  This was a small machine which ran paper over a row of tiny pins which could be turned on and off. This placed an electrostatic charge on the slick coated paper, which was then pulled over a tank of liquid containing toner. The toner was attracted to the charge, and was then somehow fused to the paper.  The result was more like dark grey on light grey than black on white. Resolution was under 100DPI. This was a prototype.<p>Al Misek at Chi built a controller for the thing so that it could talk to the 1108. The controller had an early character generator, so it could print text in one rather bad font.  It could also do graphics, I wrote software to do 3D plots with it, and still have some of the printouts.  I think that&#x27;s one of my drawings in the Computerworld article [1]; my 3D graphing program was often used as a demo.<p>Clevite/Brush didn&#x27;t intend to build a printer. They built chart recorders (like this [2]) to draw plots on paper from analog input data. (That&#x27;s how you recorded data from experiments and industrial processes back then.) Those devices moved a pen back and forth mechanically, so they had very low frequency response.  The electrostatic printer technology was developed for a faster chart recorder.  Then someone realized it could do more than draw lines, so they made up a prototype and let Chi use it.<p>Clevite never did much with that technology, but Versatec did, and for most of the 1970s, electrostatic printers were a popular output device. Quality never got very good, but the machines were fast and not too expensive.  &quot;Troff&quot; supported Versatecs.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=849&dat=19700225&id=Q5obAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v1MEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6030,1625397&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=849&dat=19700225&id=Q...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/Clevite-Brush-Instruments-15-6327-10-Mark-280-Recorder-AS-IS-/262113928622"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebay.com/itm/Clevite-Brush-Instruments-15-6327-10...</a>",1446669100

But from what I have read and seen in life, people with secure, well paid jobs who don&#x27;t actually need the money very frequently put up all kinds of self imposed barriers between themselves and making something entrepreneurial happen successfully. They turn their noses up at work they could be doing or avenues for making money that are, in fact, currently open to them, while waiting for something better that fits their narrow parameters of what is <i>acceptable.</i> Sometimes nothing better ever does show up. They are sometimes turning their noses up at the only avenue that will ever start them down the path they state they wish to take. When nothing shows up that meets their picky standards, they often then complain about how baffled and frustrated they are that they just can&#x27;t seem to make it work.<p>There is nothing wrong with saying &quot;I only want to make this transition if it meets thus and such conditions because I am basically happy where I am at, so it needs to flat out be an improvement of my current situation or I am not interested at all.&quot; But that isn&#x27;t usually the position these people take. They usually express extreme bafflement and frustration at how impossible it is while actively throttling any hope of success because their expectations are simply too high.<p>All I am saying is &quot;Well, you actually <i>can</i> start doing side work <i>right now</i> and are choosing not to. First, recognize that it is a <i>choice.</i>&quot;<p>The OP can make that choice if they so desire, but people are usually happier with their lives and also more effective when they recognize that, no, really, they are <i>making a choice.</i> Doors aren&#x27;t actually barred and locked to them.

I could have got one from Amazon but after hearing so many stories about scams or refurb devices or devices with someone else&#x27;s state on it I decided not to deal with that headache and ordered direct from the Apple website.<p>Upon turning on the device for the first time it showed a screen saying it was controlled by the LDS Church and wouldn&#x27;t proceed through guided setup until I acknowledged that. After some time on the phone with customer service, we determined there was no way to remove this configuration. I ended up having to return it to an Apple store. The rep there said &quot;yeah that happens sometimes&quot; (someone pulled from the wrong pile in fulfillment most likely). So sometimes you&#x27;re damned if you do, and damned if you don&#x27;t.<p>If anything Amazon&#x27;s customer service is better - to resolve an issue like this for items they ship I don&#x27;t have to drive anywhere, just put the box back on my front doorstep. I wish they would make it clearer when you&#x27;re buying things from them, and would do a better job of associating compatible products.

I don&#x27;t follow.<p>You dismissed the idea that forceful redistribution of capital is a problem at all because force already exists throughout society. By extension you must be perfectly fine with the other forms of force enumerated.<p>>Suppose you have a lot of money and I want some. So I hack your bank account and take it, except you don&#x27;t let me because you call the police who arrest me, or maybe just the threat of arrest deters me. Either way, you are using force to restrict my freedom to take the money lying there in the bank. Now, if you say that you didn&#x27;t give your consent to my taking the money, and it was I that used force when taking it, then we will get into a very long discussion about what consent means, and I will say that consent or coercion are not binary but a spectrum and a person is almost never at either extreme (as various psychological experiments have shown).<p>In other words you&#x27;ve perverted the definitions of otherwise very clear words as to make this discussion entirely worthless.<p>>For ownership to be effective it must be enforced by violence or the threat of violence towards those who want to violate it, hence -- it requires force, and is therefore a restriction on freedom.<p>I think I understand what you&#x27;re getting at but I still fail to see how it&#x27;s relevant. Yes, if I own something and I protect it from theft, I will use violence. But when I previously mentioned force, it was not the reactionary use of violence I was referring to.

These are massively over-engineered specifically to contain even unlikely problems. We learned that this was important after the SL-1 accident[3]. As you suggest, this is a feature designed to <i>fail safely</i> - the containment should keep the rest of us outside the building safe, and doesn&#x27;t say anything about what happens to the stuff in side.<p>> meltdown<p>This term is thrown around a lot, and while solid fuel melting in a traditional reactor is a serious event, a lot of people seem to think that &quot;meltdown&quot; is some kind of terrible or damaging event. The reason people in the nuclear industry panic over a possible meltdown has little to do with safety; up until that point you could - in theory - still reasonably believe that the reactor could be fixed and (eventually) restarted. After a meltdown, you have to assume the core is trashed and is now a financial <i>liability</i> instead of your main source of revenue.<p>Meltdowns are a terrible event financially. The actual melting of the fuel involves the passive-safety, which are usually designed to drain that fuel into (multiple) areas where it can cool down without criticality risk.<p>All of this is still discussing <i>very old</i> features. This is like worrying about <i>today&#x27;s</i> computers because vacuum tubes are fragile and need to be replaced when they burn out. Modern reactor design is very different, because we learned form the problems that happened in the original designs, just like any other technology. Unfortunately, propaganda based on radiophobia has been a serious roadblock. Ironically, this means we&#x27;re stuck using older designs that should have been replaced <i>decades</i> ago with modern reactors that emphasis passive safety.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in a brief overview of these problems (and why some of us believe thorium breeder reactors are the answer for <i>many</i> of these problems), I recommend watching &quot;Th&quot;[4].

You can rail those on their own flatbeds, but that&#x27;s also not optimal.  Intermodal ISO containers make a lot more sense for sea and (sort of) rail; some sense for trucking, especially final delivery, but not OTR; very little sense for air freight (although I&#x27;ve seen a bunch of specially configured equipment shelter 20&#x27; containers shipped in cargo aircraft, it&#x27;s not done for general cargo because the tare weight is in the tons when you&#x27;re paying $1-20+/pound; they also don&#x27;t work well with aircraft cargo handling, and can&#x27;t fit as standardized ULD or loose cargo in passenger aircraft.)<p>Repacking your cargo from one container to another sucks for a lot of reasons: cost, time, theft, damage, etc.<p>There&#x27;s also a latency and performance improvement if you can go door to door with a truck, vs. do intermodal with a train in the middle.  Unless you&#x27;re moving a bulk commodity to a high-volume location, it&#x27;s unlikely they have rail directly to the destination.  (Coal power plants do; lots of modern light industrial manufacturing sites do not.)<p>Optimizing air vs. truck vs. rail vs. ship across your whole supply chain is an interesting problem.<p>Another fun thing: with robo drivers, you could go essentially non-stop (except for fueling) door to door.  Otherwise, you need a team driver or relay concept (usually you carry 2-3 drivers and swap them enroute; you could also do something with depots where you swap out drivers while retaining the vehicle, which I think is done for some high security convoy operations.)  That makes the truck vs. rail advantage even greater.",1446667728

Speaking anecdotally, I know many people who graduated from college and headed to the Bay Area to look for a job. I myself moved to Mountain View for a job, then later moved away.<p>A more complete analysis along the lines you took would look at where people in engineering and product management were, say, 1 or 5 years previous. That are would likely better characterize the relevant population statistics.<p>As an obviously contrived example, suppose people in engineering and product management are only in the Bay Area for 4 years, burn out, and leave, and suppose the companies offer free relocation from anywhere in the US. Then it doesn&#x27;t make sense to look at the local demographics.<p>As a more real-world case, consider a place like Los Alamos National Labs, which has a large number of people from around the world working there, with a relatively high turnover rate partially due to interns, post-docs, and visiting professors. Los Alamos county was carved out for the lab, so the demographics of the county reflect the lab, but most of the people working at the lab are not from Los Alamos.<p>I do not have access to these sorts of numbers, merely pointing out how it&#x27;s not easy to interpret the numbers you gave, or the certainty of your conclusion that it&#x27;s a &quot;not unexpected&quot; result.

Blocking and restricting flash is as much about security as battery, more-so in my opinion.<p>But OK, let&#x27;s compromise -- rather than preventing connections to Wordpress sites, maybe they could draw a big red line through a picture of the Wordpress logo, and then perhaps warn the user that this site is or soon will be serving malware.",1446667252

I work in cancer and disease genomics doing data analysis software and all of the analysis methodology goes back to this reference in some way.<p>Sequencing technology has gotten to a point where it's just blown Moore's Law absolutely out of the water and we can't throw more compute at the analysis problem, we have to make it smarter.  The reference genome is used in how that's been made smarter.<p>It helps to discuss a little bit about how the HGP reference was produced, and why producing it took 10 years and three billion dollars.<p>The HGP process first had a map made, where the genome was broken into lots of smaller segments.  The idea was that this reduced your problem space; any segment of DNA produced from a sample from that portion of the genome came from that area.  Then that segment was broken into lots and lots of smaller chunks and then read on the sequencing machines in 600-800 base segments.  By the time that sequencing technology reached ""max level,"" the state of the art machine could generate 96 of those segments in an hour's time.<p>Then you'd calculate overlaps and assemble those smaller ""reads"" back into a sequence of that chunk you chose from the map.  Then someone would audit the computer-generated assembly by hand, possibly ordering up more lab work to fill any gaps or resolve areas of crummy data. Repeat for the next chunk from the map.<p>Now here's how things work, when we need to do any sort of genomic analysis on an individual:<p>New technology has the ability to sequence human genomes at deep coverage in 11 days[1], and cranks out 6 billion reads 100bp long from places all over the genome.  Computationally, this is an absolutely different animal. You can't feasibly try to re-assemble these reads into a human.  So, what we do is use string matching algorithms to ""map"" a 100bp read back to where it most likely came from, using the HGP genome as a reference.[2] Since obviously your DNA does not match the HGP reference base-for-base, and mismatches/insertions+deletions are really where the interesting data is anyway, there's some leeway for mismatches in the mapping.<p>At that point, by mapping reads back to where they came from, we end up with a data file that represents an individual's genome.  You're able to walk across the genome base for base and ask ""So, base 347 of Chromosome 7 is a T in the reference, what is the most likely base on Joe's genome at this point given the reads we have that span this base?""<p>Mapping things to the reference also allows us to attempt to find really interesting stuff that can cause disease, such as structural variations in the genome.  These are instances where large segments are removed, duplicated, inverted, or picked up and moved somewhere else relative to where they ""should be.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.illumina.com/systems/hiseq_comparison.ilmn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.illumina.com/systems/hiseq_comparison.ilmn</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/</a> is the tool that's most popular these days.",1367807568

Because the ""hater's"" identity in this situation is not anonymous either.<p>For most people, posting under their real identity doesn't really get them in trouble. I'm talking about posters who discuss controversial topics publicly- not only is it so easy for someone to send in anonymous hate emails, but now they can anonymously harass the poster in real life by calling up their boss or family members, after a few clicks of research on the Internet.<p>It makes me wonder in what form this kind of ""hateful"" harassment (say, one step below actual hate crimes) existed in the days without Internet.",1367807442

On Facebook you can post updates on important life things,  things no one cares about, or even touchy subjects without much fear of being harassed.  On places like Reddit, or deeper down into 4chan, or other sites that are known for their 'lynching' it gets riskier to be so 'outspoken' with your real identity because there are larger quantities of people that you don't know that are way off from your personal network thus making the possibilites well endless.<p>When it's an accepted peer to peer network it's different from either a 'real' user to anonymous user or anon user to anon user.  The more anonymous people are, the more brave they become but as soon as their real identity is attached, things don't get quite so serious, at least not in the main factions of social media.

Fallacies are what they are because they describe faults in reasoning: they describe the terms under which a conclusion does not follow from the premises given.<p>The argument from authority, argumentum ad auctoritatem, is a well-known and well-understood fallacy. Take the GGP's scenario: I am sick, and there is a doctor who has prescribed treatment or a cure.<p>By virtue of being a doctor, it's implied that they are a medical expert. Going to a doctor and trusting him is not the same as going to Joe the Plumber and asking him for medical advice.<p>So if I, being a layman, believe that the doctor is actually a doctor (and thus, an expert) <i>and</i> I have no contrary knowledge to refute the doctor's claim, there is nothing that prevents me from trusting his prescription provided I have no reason to believe he is biased or his prescription goes against the consensus of the greater medical community on my sickness.<p>That last part is key, and how trusting a doctor when you are sick is <i>not</i> an appeal to authority. If the doctor in question is an expert in the field and expert consensus agrees on a treatment or cure, I can get a second, or third, or fourth opinion from other expert doctors and get the same answer.<p>So by trusting a doctor, I'm not willy-nilly putting faith in someone else. Rather, I'm using inductive reasoning to make a reasonably valid conclusion.<p>One could refute any of the premisesthat the doctor isn't really an expert, or that there really isn't consensus, or that the doctor isn't really impartialand that's fine, but if I have every reason to believe that the doctor is, in fact, an unbiased expert and representative of consensus (or, conversely, no reason to believe that he isn't any of those things), I am justified in believing what he says.",1367807220

Different systems provide different levels of access to their internals. The vast majority of Emacs is written in Lisp, and can therefore be hooked and rewritten.  Its C code is an Emacs interpreter and text editing/rendering engine.

The intentions are noble and clear, but is a poster with magic number enough to help? Most people will see a poster with a beaten up kid, but no number, so it kind of loses effect. If the number was always visible it might be of more help and doubtful it would be any child in danger. The money spent on this campaign will far outweigh any benefit it provides and it somewhat saddens me.<p>The number #1 thing kids who are abused have mostly in common is that they go to school. Teachers are exceptionally good at spotting signs of abuse and reporting it, it's highly encouraged especially here in Australian educational communities. Posters with the number clearly displayed being plastered around school grounds and playgrounds would probably be more beneficial and helpful in my opinion as parents or perpetrators are most likely not following the kids they're abusing around the school between classes.",1367805857

You cannot even do the argument you claim to be against even a modicum of justice. If you have something <i>specific</i> that you disagree with, I would try to provide an answer or point you in the right direction. However, I'm not going to tap out a dissertation for someone who is clearly woefully ignorant of even the basics. For starters, the question of the origin of the universe, of abiogenesis, and of the evolution of life are completely separate questions. You reveal yourself to be completely misinformed when you conflate these three separate issues.<p>But yeah, keep on beating that ""randomness"" strawman to a pulp. Feel free to offer specific questions if you want to actually engage in a conversation. But make no mistake, nothing you have said so far shows even the faintest understanding of what you claim to be against.",1367805625

I am a VIM user, although not a fanatical one, I see the merits of having a language like eLISP for emacs, but honestly I think they are both outdated. If I wasn't so partial to using a command line editor (I use the terminal a lot), i'd switch to Sublime text 2 because it uses python, and I'd rather use a modern scripting language than either vimscript or eLISP.",1367805622

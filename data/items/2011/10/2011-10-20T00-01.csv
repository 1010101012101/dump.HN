What I got out of the article was ""I think I know how Google should design its product, and thus I deem decisions not in agreement to be total bullshit.""<p>Personally, I prefer to respect the work they've put into the product and to accept that they may have insights deeper than mine. It's evident from Google's announcement that they see more complex issues around pseudonyms, and I will form an opinion after I see their changes. I do not understand this attitude of ""Fuck those guys"" - so much anger over a social network!",1319072398

The only reason I have a desktop is for gaming.  I imagine most people who buy new desktops now only get them for gaming.

A plenoptic camera (this is what Lytro are selling) trades off resolution against the ability to discriminate between angles.<p>Take an ordinary camera sensor, with (let's say) 16MP in a 4000x4000 array. Group them into (let's say) 8x8 blocks, of which there are 500x500. Now put a little lens in front of each block, with focal length equal to the distance from lens to sensor.<p>A light ray reaching one of those blocks will end up on one of the block's pixels; which ray depends on (not the exact position at which the ray meets the array of lenses, but) the angle at which it's travelling.<p>Now, imagine an image that's not quite focused correctly on the camera sensor. What that means is that for each point of the object you're imaging, you get a cone of light rays that are converging towards some point either in front of the sensor or behind it. With an ordinary camera, that just gives you a circular blur and you're screwed. With a plenoptic camera, you can tell what angle the light in that circular blur was coming in at, which means you can determine where it would have gone if the sensor had been further back or further forward, which means you can reconstruct what you'd have got if the focus had been different. (What if it <i>is</i> focused perfectly? Well, you still get to know the distribution of angles from which the light is reaching the sensor, which means you can work out how the image would have been blurred out with a different focus.)<p>The main price you pay for all this is a severe loss of resolution: your output ""pixels"" are the blocks of pixels on the sensor.

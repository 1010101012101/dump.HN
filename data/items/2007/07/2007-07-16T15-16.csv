34484,comment,34461,34480,0,0,gregwebs,,,"From what I gather, it would always be better for their product to run faster, so they probably felt they had to use C++.  I believe they are using Java for the front end because they found good libraries for what they wanted to do.  It is possible they are being productive with their Java code by using pre-exising libraries, but their C++ is from scratch.
It does also seems that they are comfortable and experienced using both languages.  I don't think it crossed their mind to use other fast languages in place of C++ such as D, O'Caml, or Haskell.",1184600964

Personally I think that focus on content is the most important aspect of design, so I'm glad that the article points it out, though I am loathe to refer to it as a 'trend'.",1184600063
34482,comment,34114,34114,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"""Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, ``The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.'' I don't know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.""<p>-- Richard Hamming, ""You and Your Research""

34480,comment,34461,34461,0,0,willarson,,,"I think the important question is ""why are they using C++/Java?""<p>
If they are using them for efficiency reasons, then this may be a case prematurely optimization, and they may not like the tools either, but feel trapped into using them.<p>
On the other hand they may be using them because they are most comfortable and experienced using them. This is a pretty good reason to use a language, but eventually leads to stagnation.",1184599318

This is definitely not the first example you want to show in your homepage, if the purpose of your site is to help with personal relations.<p>The intent of the site is good.  I think there will be a big market for this kind of thing if you find a way to help.<p>An address book is good; just lose the my.peeps name and call it an address book.  People are not eager to learn new fancy names for things.  <p>Reminders about relevant events (birthdays, anniversaries) is good.<p>Of course there is plenty of software around that provides address book and calendar functionality, so these can't be your selling features.  Semirandom reminders to do something special?  OK, a bit mechanical, but I guess they help.<p>I'm not sure about the functionality you offer, but anyway I don't think functionality is what matters the most here.  I think you want to look for community features.  Somehow encourage your customers to ask for and share tips.  The value of your site will not come from functionality, but from becoming a hub for people interested in these matters.  IMO, if you achieve that, you're golden.<p>A minor one: lose the ""best viewed with"" tag.  That's so 90's :).  People aren't going to get a different browser to go to your site; if your site doesn't work on <i>their</i> browser, they're just going away.  Alien logos are noise and cheapen the feel of your site.  Don't let any in, unless there is some serious business motivation for it.<p>[Edit: fixing formatting hiccups.]",1184598953

On one hand its mostly true (its easy to get the majority of functionality working), but its also a bit of bravado: raw functionality and a polished product are not really equivalent.",1184598813

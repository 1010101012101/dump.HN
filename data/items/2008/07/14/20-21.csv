246073,comment,245870,245937,0,0,jules,,,"Have you thought about handling this at the language level? Instead of allocating the closure on the server you send a string representation of the closure to the client.<p>First make sure that the lambda doesn't have free variables by adding the free variables to the argument list. (lambda (x) (+ n x)) => (lambda (x n) (+ n x)) Because the resulting lambda doesn't have any free variables you can turn it into a global function. (lambda (x n) (+ n x)) => function#345 and somewhere else you (define (function#345 x n) (+ n x)).<p>Next you store the values of the free variables in a hash table (use the memory location of the data as the key for the hash). Now you have a string representation for this closure. The representation contains the function's name (function#345) and the keys of the free variables in the hash table.<p>An example. Assume that users are represented by a cons cell (cons user-name karma). We're writing a page that has a link called ""increment karma"". When you click this link your karma is incremented.<p><pre><code>  (let ((user the-current-user))\n    (display-link ""increment karma""\n                   (lambda () (set-cdr user (+ 1 (cdr user))))))\n</code></pre>\nFirst transform this to:<p><pre><code>  (define (function#345 user)\n    (set-cdr user (+ 1 (cdr user))))\n\n  (let ((user the-current-user))\n    (display-link ""increment karma""\n                  (make-closure function#345 user)))\n</code></pre>\nmake-closure in pseudo code (assuming there is one free variable/argument):<p><pre><code>  (define (make-closure fn arg)              \n    (add-to-hash *free-variables* (memory-location arg) arg)\n    (add-to-hash *functions* (memory-location fn) fn)\n    (concat (to-string (memory-location fn)) ""/"" (to-string (memory-location arg))))\n</code></pre>\nWhen the server gets a request it parses the string representation of the closure, looks up the free variables and calls the function.<p><pre><code>  (define (invoke-closure closure)\n     (let ((fn <lookup thing before ""/"" in *functions*>)\n           (arg <lookup thing after ""/"" in *free-variables*>))\n        (fn arg)))\n</code></pre>\nThis solves the problem of allocating closures but the global hash table keeps growing. This may not be a problem in the average case. Consider the usual data in free variables: front page links, users, etc. These things have to be stored on the server anyway. For temporary data that isn't stored permanently you can use a seperate hash table that is cleaned up every x minutes or after it gets too big (just like the closures you're storing now).<p>What do you think? I'm sorry if this explanation isn't clear. I'm not good at explaining these things, especially in english.",1216068624

246070,comment,245963,246047,0,0,tstegart,,,"Good point, however, if you own the printer, the information is still valuable. If you have the printer serial number, and own the printer in question, you can find out who may have printed it. Or who in an opposing organization may have printed it, if you're in a legal environment and can request discovery. But you're right, if the printer in question is owned by an unknown third party, you would need the help of law enforcement or Xerox, etc. However, even this would lead to entrepreneurial gain. Without being able to decode the dots, a person in possession of the originals would still not know who printed them. Knowing what printer they were manufactured on and the serial number, a company can now initiate legal action on a manufacturer to get the required information, just like law enforcement does. Today, no one has the codes, but if you did, people would want what you have, no doubt about it.",1216068261

246053,comment,245976,246048,0,0,Locke,,,"A good question.  It's been a while since I played on yahoo games, so I'm not sure I can do a full comparison justice.<p>At yahoo games the focus is (or was, anyway) on real-time play.  You play games serially.  You spend a lot of time waiting for your opponent to move.  Or, if you spend too much time thinking you take verbal punishment from someone who's impatient.<p>At Vying Games you <i>can</i> play real-time.  But, most people play turn-based (more like correspondence chess).  You tend to have multiple games going at once.  When you have a few minutes throughout the day you go through your games and make your moves.  You don't really spend time waiting for your opponent.  You don't feel rushed.  This is great for busy people who want to enjoy games a few minutes at a time.<p>Philosophically, I don't want to get as obnoxious about advertising.  I'd rather the site have a more adult (mature?) community.  And, I'd rather focus on more obscure (but great!) games where possible.",1216067155

They think ""the elites"" made up functional programming (and similar things) just to make programming harder.  That's not true, the good programmers know that these abstractions make things easier.  That's why we use them.<p>However, if the ""I hate thinking when I could be cutting and pasting"" programmer is your blog's audience, it makes sense to agree with them.  More ad revenue.<p>I don't really see this as elitism, I see it as reality.  For what it's worth, I have no problem trying to educate these developers and turn them into good programmers.  My blog is mostly instructional, I give free talks at every conference I can, and I teach paid classes if companies really want to make sure their developers learn good practices.  Some people can be educated, and I am always happy when people realize that writing good code is fun.<p>However, some people really don't get what programming is about, and those people are going to criticize things that are ""hard"".

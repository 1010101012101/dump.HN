If you want to learn about finance, work for a fucking bank!  If you want to make contacts, you could do a lot worse than a top MBA program.<p>An EE friend of mine (who helped me survive PChem, since I taught myself linear algebra and multivariate calculus, poorly) went back for his MBA recently.  He began a standard engineering exposition of market forces in terms of structural equations and nearly the entire class glazed over. Afterwards, the professor (a former physicist) told him that, while his math was spot on, you can't use calculus in front of businesspeople and expect them to follow.<p>He almost cried.  I laffed when he told me about this.  (We both worked at JGSM and also at the supercomputing center as undergraduates -- even still, I think he was disappointed.)<p>Scientific programmers (what I was trained as) and everyday build-something-that-works programmers (which is more fun) are as different as FORTRAN77 and Lisp.

There is, however, a divide between systems/performance-centric programming and logic-centric or symbolic programming, and the latter is more efficient in terms of man-hours IMHO.",1202406330

You'll need the soft skills eventually, if you get big & political, but in order to get to that stage you need to do the work yourself.<p>Also, business skills are often very context-dependent.  What works for McKinsey probably doesn't work for Coca-Cola, which doesn't work for SAP, which doesn't work for Microsoft, which doesn't work for Apple, which doesn't work for Google.  Ignoring this fact led to disasters like John Sculley and AOL/Time Warner.  While if you learn to hack, you know that there's at least one path that's guaranteed to get you to working software, and then you can assess the context from there.<p>Stay alert to business issues though, and try to learn all you can about business on your own time.  If there's an entrepreneurs' club, join it; the club itself is probably useless, but they often do practical projects that give you some real experience.  If you can, start a side business like web design or software contracting or tutoring in college (I didn't, but I wish I had).",1202405590

111068,comment,110571,110648,0,0,olavk,,,"> libraries so powerful, apparently, that it's cheating to compare Arc to other languages using a problem that requires saving a string on the server<p>It is kind of a straw man though, but he also got a point. Clearly the use of continuations allows very compact descriptions of multi-page control flow. The only languages that can match the succinctness of Arc in the Arc-challenge are other lisps, Ruby and Smalltalk/Seaside, which all of them also uses continuations. Python which is otherwise known for succinctness but which doesn't expose continuations, does not allow such compact code.<p>On the other hand it is a straw man because you would not use continuation for navigation in real-world production web sites. You would have to store a continuation for every hit on the site forever, which is clearly not scalable. Therefore it is obvious that serious web frameworks uses other approaches more in line with the stateless nature of HTTP, even if it leads to more verbose code.<p>I still think the arc-challenge is fun (and I agree that brevity is very desirable), but I think it would be more ""fair"" if it was framed with real world requirements (scalable, pages bookmarkable etc.) rather than random constraints (the user input must not be exposed in the URL) which only serves to disqualify some non-continuation-based frameworks.<p>Continuation-based web frameworks suffers IMHO from the same mistake as ASP.NET - trying to make web development look like traditional application code. ASP.NET tries to make it look like event-based desktop GUI app development, Arc tries to make it look like a long-running interactive app written in a function style.<p>What web-frameworks are really trying to, is to create a new kind of DSL which embraces the spirit and constraints of the web rather than try to hide it. We are not there yet, and such a holy-grail web app DSL might very well be written in Arc one day. It would probably be very short then.",1202404793

(my mother is Austrian, my father British) There is an (awful) home video of me in which I speak both languages fluently, roughly age 2. Comparing the way you think to other people's thought processes is not so easy, putting differences down to some particular influence is impossible, especially as there's no before & after to compare.<p>That said, I don't generally think in terms of words unless I'm actively trying to express a thought. I don't know whether this is why I'm very quick to pick up new concepts in maths and computing, of if those observations are unrelated.<p>Interestingly, I did have a noticeable Germanic accent when speaking English as I lived in Austria for the first 18 years of my life. I then went to study and work in England, and within less than 3 years my accent had disappeared sufficiently for strangers to be unable to distinguish me from natives. Kids learn English at school in most of Europe from about age 9 - I knew some German students at university and their accent stuck, even after 4 years. That head start of a few years obviously makes a hell of a difference.<p>Learning French (at age 14) and Spanish (at age 16) was still hard for me.

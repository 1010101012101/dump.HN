It also doesn't accept anything based on a word -- the password ""Poopio123!"" was rejected for being based on the word ""opio.""<p>The first thing I did was email it to myself.",1217483628

262717,comment,259756,259858,0,0,brokenladder,,,"Score Voting (aka Range Votiing) and Approval Voting are actually the best voting methods, especially when you take strategic voting into account.\n<a href=""http://rangevoting.org/StratHonMix.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rangevoting.org/StratHonMix.html</a><p>In this case, even if the election result changed, you'd still get a candidate who was rated relatively well by the average voter, so the results would not be that much worse.  Now consider that other voting methods react much worse to strategic voters, _and_ that score voting is as good with a great number of strategic voters as other systems are with 100% honest voters, and this whole argument falls flat.",1217482098
262714,comment,262072,262072,0,0,sonink,,,"I think labmeeting is a great idea and also something which could be very useful.<p>Specifically, I believe there is a lot of value in breaking up the traditional research publication methods - Conferences, Papers, Journals and the costly (atleast for developing nations) access to this material controlled by a view publishing houses.<p>Research and collaboration needs to open up for everyone and should work freely over the internet rather centered around conferences etc. If labmeeting can enable something like that (which I guess is something its founders would have though about) it can very well change the way research is conducted.",1217481685

262709,comment,262660,262663,0,0,NoBSWebDesign,,,"Oh, and one thing I would ask about in particular is what your opinions are on homepage calls to action.<p>RateMyStudentRental essentially needs students to rate their rentals. However, just saying ""Rate your rental now"" on the homepage doesn't offer much immediate benefit to the student, and thus does not convert very well. I've had several iterations of the homepage that I've tried out, and just recently made a change (last night) that focuses solely on ""Browse Rentals"" for the main call to action.<p>A lot of my knowledge on the subject matter comes from studies and reports such as this:\n<a href=""http://www.marketingexperiments.com/improving-website-conversion/optimizing-ecommerce-websites.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketingexperiments.com/improving-website-conver...</a><p>Anyway, your thoughts would be greatly appreciated!",1217481228

That is, until I learned the language and the standard libraries. I've never looked at Erlang, but I'd bet it's the same issue.<p>A C++ programmer can look at C# code and figure out what it's doing because they have similar syntax and vocabulary.

Power, I might add, that frequently comes at the expense of our rights and privacy. From the Patriot Act to the ugliness it empowered (NSLs, etc.) to the broadening of power referenced in the subject article and everything in between; there is a constant, undeniable power creep. Now, you may need ""reasoned argument"" to help you establish whether you believe this is justified, etc. But, you cannot deny the existence of an ever-broadening government power.<p>Perhaps you found my wording too rhetorical for your taste. I can certainly live with that. But, if it is substance you seek, that substance can be found in the article itself along with the countless other instances of the government accruing more power. My comment was merely commentary on this substance.<p>Still, we may disagree on where all of this is taking us. You say that it's hyperbole to speak of the nation's dismantling. I would argue that the nation is already fundamentally differerent and that its demise, on principal, is not only imminent, but nearly complete. It is the sum total of changes like this one that makes it so.<p>Because, irrespective of the opinion you reach through reasoned argument as to the ""neccessity"" of the changes, the changes themselves represent the morphing of our nation into something entirely different; in other words, its dismantling piece by piece.",1364421313

Yes, it really helps, miraculously! But dont know how. Those of you who have had a lifetime experience with Full Throttle OnDemand must be having this question on mind. Here is the explanation, read it out:
Full Throttle On Demand works by targeting the biological complicacies of sex from the root itself. Unlike its other counterparts who work for a market status, this medication aims at improving the condition gradually instead of curing it instantly with a shorter longevity. And also ensures zero fatal side effects too, dont forget it! 
Full Throttle On Demand consists of herbal ingredients like rose root, guarana seeds, grape seed extract, MuiraPuama, Damiana and ginseng. These are specifically natural sex stimulants which control the sex hormones of human beings with their own phytohormones. What makes these more reliable is that each pill consists of the exact amount of ingredients that is enough to stimulate the sex drive. Soy bean extract particularly has profound role in improving female sexual complicacies by controlling the secretion and flow of female sex hormone estrogen, which is primarily responsible for the regularity of the periodic cycle in females. 
The pills after intake increase the blood flow to the dormant sexual organs stimulating and arousing them. In males it ensures a stronger, longer and firm erection that lasts for a long time. Menopause and irregularity complications, pregnancy related issues and sexual discomforts in females are also reduced after the usage. And all this happens in a herbal way! Isnt it truly safe and secure in a market where chemical drugs dominate the industry? 
Its usage is very simple! It takes nearly two hours to react and remains effective as long as 72 hours. Incredible! Get into this incredibility and give yourself an incredibly incredible bed time experience!",1364420720

I felt I had to reply to this comment to discourage this practice for a couple of reasons:<p>1) By convention anyone reading your code will think this is very strange, and it will force them to spend additional time reading your code to understand why you are breaking such a strong convention.<p>2) Using properties really will make your life easier when you need to track down a state change in your program. Detecting a state change on a public setter is a lot easier than detecting state change on a public field.<p>3) In C#, at least, using public fields where you should be using public properties will make creating an interface on existing code significantly more difficult - as interfaces can only define public properties, and not fields.<p>In short please don't do this.

How are we supposed to know it isn't just music fans writing stuff off the top of their head? The only reason Wikipedia articles are trustworthy at all is because they cite their sources, and I can follow up those citations and see what they say for myself. I have no reason to believe some random Wikipedia editor otherwise.<p>Overall, it's an encyclopedia with a (very) large but nonetheless delimited goal: summarizing the existing literature on as many subjects as there is existing literature. That is a lot of things, and it already seems almost absurdly ambitious to set out to summarize all of them, without trying to expand the scope further!<p>I also participate in projects with different goals, documenting things that <i>aren't</i> currently documented by existing literature. One of them is a music-related wiki project documenting an under-documented music scene. I think those kinds of projects are also worthwhile (or I wouldn't spend my time on them). But I don't see that as the same job as Wikipedia, which as a tertiary source should only be summarizing existing secondary literature, not doing its own independent investigations. I don't actually understand the motivation for <i>why</i> people want to merge this kind of wiki with Wikipedia, either, since it seems like a clearly different kind of activity, requiring different standards and probably a different community. Is it just that there is some cachet (whether SEO or just general prestige) to having a Wikipedia article, while there isn't the same cachet to having an article on a music-scene wiki?<p>I did write something [1] about the main problem area that results: stuff that is clearly notable, where you'd <i>think</i> sources should exist that Wikipedia could cite, but then when you look, there just isn't much solid written on the subject. This is indeed a pain point, but I'm not sure what could be done about it short of writing un-cited or very-poorly-cited articles, which I think is worse than not having an article. Not having an article is at least honest about Wikipedia's current inability to provide a well-sourced article on the subject.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/wikipedia_notability_verifiability...</a>",1364420439

As an added benefit, I now had a local DNS caching server too, and since my machines use this as their primary DNS server, it needs to be recursive and not just respond to queries for my internal fia.intra. network.<p>Now, all this is running on an internal 192.168.1.0 network, and bind is set up to only respond to queries from 192.168.1.0/24, and I'm behind an ADSL NAT gateway, so noone from outside should be able to query my internal DNS server.<p>I ignorantly assumed that the ADSL modem wasn't completely broken and having a moronic way of operating.<p>Now, I've <i>not</i> set a port forwarding rule in the modem that forwards port 53 to my internal DNS server, the only port forwarding rule I have is one for SSH.<p>However, I have this setting on the ADSL modem: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/dlL9LKV.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/dlL9LKV.png</a><p>The ADSL modem as shipped from the ISP acts as DHCP server on the LAN side, as most modems would do, and by default the DHCP server hands out a DNS server that is my ISPs DNS server. I changed that to my internal DNS server, 192.168.1.20.<p>In the image you will see the DHCP server isn't even enabled,  I moved that to my same Debian machine and turned it off on the ADSL modem, but didn't erase the DNS settings.<p>As it turns out, because of that setting the ADSL modem listens on port 53 on the WAN interface(which has a routable IP address), and forwards/reverse-NATs queries to my DNS server at 192.168.1.20.
I'd never guessed it to do that.<p>I did a ""dig google.com @<my.public.ip>""  from an EC2 instance I have, and indeed it responded nicely..<p>I've now changed the setting to read ""Primary DNS Server= 0.0.0.0"" and have verified I no longer respond to DNS queries from the WAN side.<p>Stuff sucks.",1364419998

5452118,comment,5448923,5450221,3,0,dgreensp,,,"I'm still working on this problem myself, but we can get some answers from the assumptions in the question:<p>1. Don't link perfection and pride so strongly.  Find ways to be proud of other things about your work besides ""perfection.""  Many of us are perfectionists or recovering perfectionists, and we aren't sure what's ok to be proud of besides an A+ or brushing against some platonic ideal.  Pride is individual and has to do with our identity, so find what resonates with you.  Try being proud of: just doing the work -- productivity, reliability, consistency, quantity; particular skills or expertise; specific aspects of quality that you personally value; the end product and the good it will do or who it will please.  I draw inspiration from creative professionals (writers, artists, performers) who have strong process and show up each day to face the blank page.  I like to create delightful and visually beautiful things.  If you are too egoistic about your work or your job just isn't a good fit for the kind of work you are proud to do, you may need to find another job, but usually you can go far by getting in touch with what things that make you feel good about the work you do and desensitizing yourself to ""flaws"" by putting them in perspective.  ""I make perfect things"" is a lame identity; dig out a better sentence for yourself.<p>2. ""Just get it done"" and then <i>do</i> look at it ever again!  Be comfortable writing first drafts.  Start early and revise.  Or, save some improvements for the next release.  Be aware of acceptable flaws in your software without having to compulsively fix them.<p>If you are working on a team, try to align your goals with theirs and accept the constraints that come from working with other people.  It's also ok to have your own goals that no one else shares or supports.  Expect resistance, but if you believe in it and can muster the confidence and courage, do it anyway, and people will respect you later.<p>Currently, I believe that the primary cause of this mode1/mode2 divide is perfectionism fueled by fear and internal resistance.  As perfectionists, often the level or type of ""quality"" we insist on, which may be contrary to the expectations of all around us, just isn't reasonable, or isn't compatible with shipping on time or achieving our greater personal or professional goals.  Or, it may be an achievable level of quality for us, but we just aren't good at sitting down and achieving it.  We put off the tough design questions or stifle the very creativity we need to meet our own standard.<p>Another random tip:  Find small ways to be creative in your work even if they don't matter to anyone else.<p>When all else fails, invoke the ""it's just a job"" frame as necessary, have a beer and don't worry about it. :)",1364419737

As someone who works on a parallel functional language, it's very hard to sell a parallel language that isn't as fast as parallel fortran or hand-tuned C code that uses pthreads and the fastest parallel implementation of BLAS and other libraries.<p>The people who really care about performance are using those. The ones who don't are honestly mostly still writing code that has large constant factors of _sequential_ performance available as low-hanging fruit.

The .NET IL compiler actually supports closures by generating a class with the lambda's method body as method on that class. That method takes in as parameters whatever outside variables need to be captured.<p>It also supports iterator continuations (e.g. ""yield return"") by generating an entire class which inherits off of IEnumerable and wraps your single function with all the necessary trappings to track the continuation state.<p>You can see this stuff by looking at C# assemblies in a free program called ILSpy[0]. Normally it'll reverse-engineer these compiler patterns, but if you uncheck all the ""decompile"" checkboxes in the options, it'll just straight-up translate the IL to C# and you can see the dirty tricks.<p>[0] <a href=""http://ilspy.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ilspy.net/</a>",1364419333

And of course there's no unit tests or any kind of documentation or even agreement among those working on it regarding what responsibilities each part of your system has. It inevitably results in the dreaded ""big rewrite"", if you haven't fallen behind your competitors enough at this point and are still in business.<p>Like you say, it's a balance and a hard one but I'm getting more and more convinced that this false consensus results in bad advice, especially when non-technical people start throwing around ""just ship"" and ""move fast and break things"" without even knowing there is a balance.<p>There is also absolutely no context to this lean advice that this balance is <i>completely</i> different for different types of programming.

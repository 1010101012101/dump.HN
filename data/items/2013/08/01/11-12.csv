6139595,comment,6129148,6134776,2,0,jfarmer,,,"Part of Bret&#x27;s theory of learning (which I agree with) is that when &quot;illustrating&quot; or &quot;explaining&quot; an idea it is to important use multiple simultaneous representations, not solely symbolic and not solely visual.  This increases the &quot;surface area&quot; of comprehension so that a learner is much more likely to find something in this constellation of representations that relate to their prior understanding.  In fact, that comprehension might only come out of seeing the constellation.  No representation alone would have sufficed.<p>Further, you then want to build a feedback loop by allowing direct manipulation of any of the varied representations and have the other representations change accordingly.  This not only lets you see the same idea from multiple perspectives -- visual, symbolic, etc. -- but lets the learner see the ideas in motion.<p>This is where the &quot;real time&quot; stuff comes in and also why he gets annoyed when people see the it as the point of his work.  It&#x27;s not; it&#x27;s just a technology to accelerate the learning process.  It&#x27;s a very compelling technology, but it&#x27;s not the <i>foundation</i> of his work.  This is like reducing Galileo to a really good telescope engineer -- not that Bret Victor is Galileo.<p>I think he emphasizes the visual only because it&#x27;s so underdeveloped relative to symbolic.  He thinks we need better metaphors, not just better symbols or syntax.  He&#x27;s not an advocate of working &quot;purely visually.&quot;  It&#x27;s the relationship between the representations that matters.  You want to create a world where you can freely use the right metaphor for the job, so to speak.<p>That&#x27;s his mission.  It&#x27;s the mission of every constructivist interested in using computers for education. Bret is really good at pushing the state of the art which is why folks like me get really excited about him! :D<p>You might not think Bret&#x27;s talks are about education or learning, but virtually every one is.  A huge theme of his work is this question: &quot;If people learn via a continual feedback loop with their environment -- in programming we sometimes call this &#x27;debugging&#x27; -- then what are our programming environments teaching us?  Are they good teachers?  Are they (unknowingly) teaching us bad lessons?  Can we make them better teachers?&quot;",1375357260

Lots of legislators are ex-lawyers, they hanker to tidy the place up inbetween shitting on everyone.<p>> <i>It seems that, much like software, it&#x27;s a lot easier to add clauses to, or make minor changes to existing laws than it is to write a new, much simpler version that would cover all the same ground, get it passed, and repeal the older version.</i><p>Like software, it&#x27;s easy to underestimate the complexity of the existing system and to overestimate the advantages of a single, sharp cutover.<p>The current system is not perfect, but it largely works by groping towards better solutions over time. Legal systems where the official concept of law is &quot;we designed it <i>ab initio</i> with Pure Reason (tm)&quot; tend to be just as riddled with contradiction and complexity. They just lie to themselves about it.<p>> <i>I&#x27;m also curious about what effect changes to a particular law have on precedent based on an interpretation of an older version.</i><p>Most of the time it is very easy to make the connection. Either it&#x27;s new legislation, in which case the legislature will amend the clauses that a court has interpreted differently from what they considered to be the intent.

His idea was simple but genius. He would make a homepage (as they were called back then) with a grid of 100 by 100 squares each ten pixels across. Each square could hold an image 10x10 pixels. One million pixels.<p>Back when we didn&#x27;t have retina displays and Stallmann was still young designers thought 10x10 pixels was plenty to make a pretty picture. You could then buy a square for one hundred dollars; a dollar a pixel. And if people clicked on the pretty picture you had made in your square they would be taken to your homepage. If you had lots of money or worked for one of those new dot-com&#x27;s you could buy more than one square so your designer could make a bigger picture.<p>Now, you can probably guess why it was called the million Dollar Homepage (Hint 1000 x 1000 = 1 million), and as you can see all the squares were sold so the architect reached his goal, won his bet and retreated back to the matrix to devise new ingenious devious ideas.<p><i>Edit: changed ten dollars to one hundred dollars - thanks for pointing it out jgrubb.</i>",1375356025

It&#x27;s tantamount to setting global variables. At the very least, give that definition an if (!Function.new) guard to prevent redefining another implementation that another script (or the browser!) has already given.<p>* Adding methods in the constructor is awful even if you&#x27;re not using inheritance, because it burns memory like crazy. If you define sayHi on Person.prototype, then every Person gets a reference to the <i>same</i> sayHi method. If you define this.sayHi in the constructor, then each Person you create gets <i>its own copy</i> of the function, making every Person heavier in memory. Not a big deal for a simple console.log, but if you have more complicated objects with a few dozen methods that you&#x27;re using a bunch of you can really make things chug.",1375355722

The debate therefore needs to shift. The question cannot be over whether the state should have access to this information. We are powerless to push on that point.<p>The question has to be this: Given that our state (and others) will necessarily know the most intimate details of our lives, how do we want it to behave? How do we want this information to be used? What do we want the newly intimate relationship between individual and state to look and feel like? It may well be that we come to a startling different conclusion than our initial starting points might presuppose.<p>There are tremendous social benefits to be had by using this treasure-trove of information wisely, just as there are tremendous dangers to be risked by using this trove with carelessness or malicious intent. However, we need to think very carefully about how we manage the relationship between individual and state; how we manage the relationship between individual and peer; and how we manage the relationship between individual and technology.<p>I feel strongly that this is the most important debate of our generation; perhaps the most important debate to be had in this new millennium.",1375355696

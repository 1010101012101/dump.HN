I am a fully engaged social being. The &quot;me&quot; that dies is not the whole me. I identify as part of a human culture.<p>And yes, if that human culture dies -- if humanity goes extinct -- then that is just about the worst thing I could imagine. You can scale that down any number of ways, but at no point will I agree that death isn&#x27;t bad. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a single cell, a single organ, a whole person, or a whole room full of people. It&#x27;s only as good as the value it produces for the whole, and my personal suffering is not a factor to that insofar as it doesn&#x27;t disable my contribution.<p>And I didn&#x27;t say death is the worst thing that can happen to you.",1439067491

10028636,comment,10027102,10028468,0,0,hackuser,,,"I&#x27;ve tried to solve that challenge a few times now. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned so far, from most efficient to least:<p>* Ask an expert; this is a simple question for them. A university library&#x27;s reference desk has worked well for me. For example, looking for books on Egypt, I contacted a university library referece desk and was connected to the library&#x27;s Arabic Studies reference librarian, who had a Ph.D. in the field from an elite university. What was a challenging question for me was probably offhand knowledge for him. (Of course, respect their time (be prepared and patient) and the fact that you are not entitled to their services, but he seemed excited that a member of the public was interested and serious.)<p>* Look for scholarly articles reviewing publications in the field. I use Google Scholar but I get the impression JSTOR is better if you have access (I&#x27;ve never used it and know little about it). In each case I&#x27;ve read several articles to triangulate what is widely accepted and what is particular to that author, and to fill gaps in each author&#x27;s coverage. However, I find the review articles themselves fascinating, almost essential background on what I want to read, and tend to get lost in them. Lacking expertise myself, I still feel uncertain about the conclusions I draw - what don&#x27;t I know? what context am I missing? - there is no substitute for expertise.<p>* Look at class syllabi at universities. This has been slow going: I have to find the classes and the syllabi (if available), and then hope it includes more than an unannotated list of books.<p>* Do not: Use general web resources. It seems like the general web and the scholarly world are two separate silos of knowledge. I find 100x more valuable information in the scholarly articles, and random people on the web are often badly misinformed (this includes Amazon reviewers, a great source of complete nonsense that sounds good until you know better).<p>Overall, it makes me appreciate the resources available to university students, who have free and easy access to experts in a huge variety of fields, all paid to help them.",1439067305

10028628,comment,10027867,10028585,0,0,cristianpascu,,,"I think the problem of proving the (non) existence of something is as simple as understanding that (most of the time) it can not be deductive. I&#x27;d say that when it comes to existence, it is always inductive. What kind of proof can anyone give me that she/he exists? Or the rest of the world? There is no such thing. Even in mathematics, if one doubts basic entities as numbers and their properties, the whole establishment of mathematics starts to crack, at least for that particualr one human being.<p>All of our reasoning about the world is inference based, hence probabilistic. That&#x27;s in the nature of science, religion and everything else in between. There is strong evidence for the existence of God, but it&#x27;s inherently inductive. Not to mention various conceputal complication which follow from in different kind of reasoning about God (in whatever view).",1439067071

But normally, I interpret it as &quot;X does not exist independently of mental constructs and their derivative effects,&quot; which is a workable claim that can be false. And that&#x27;s how most people mean it when making those kinds of claims.<p>So there are two meanings to existence: existence &#x27;proper&#x27;, and existence as a name for the extra-mental nature of a thing.",1439067064

Currently we use bash scripts and NFS filesystems for testing and programming. It&#x27;s worked well to date, but I can&#x27;t help but think Go, Python or some other object oriented language would be a better approach(code reuse / common architecture that can be shared). My concerns are we tend to implement the same boiler plate logic over and over - call a test which passes or fails. Log low level details to a server for analysis(NFS plain text file), and display a high level pass / fail message. Most scripts are tightly coupled, so one script is used for multiple boards. This results in surprises when someone makes a change for one product and breaks another related product that shares the same bash script. The boards themselves vary widely in that the kernels could be anywhere from 2.4 to 3.1x, oabi, eabi... busybox, ubuntu, debian for filesystems... This makes me think an interpreted language such as Python would be the way to go. My concern is this is run in a manufacturing environment so interpreted languages(e.g. Python) that are slow would cost money on every board processed.

The writer touches on it but somehow skirts the real issue. When we say &quot;you can&#x27;t prove a negative&quot; you&#x27;re really saying that in order to prove a statement of the form &quot;not exists x P(x)&quot;, it&#x27;s equivalent to proving &quot;for all x not P(x)&quot; and so you&#x27;re really making a statement about EVERYTHING that has or does or could ever exist somehow. These proofs are either analytic and trivial (i.e. there doesn&#x27;t exist a rectangular circle) or not proofs.<p>He suggests you get around this by providing an argument about unicorns and then goes on to talk about how premises don&#x27;t always need to be justified, but the problem is proving the nonexistence of a thing -- and he provides a formal deductive example of a proof of nonexistence of a thing by instead substituting as a premise nonexistence of another thing (evidence). Sure, if you can prove no evidence for unicorns exists and that for unicorns to exist they MUST have left evidence you can prove they don&#x27;t exist. But the first one is a reduction to the original problem -- in order to show something doesn&#x27;t exist (be it unicorns or evidence for unicorns) you need complete and total knowledge about existence, which no human up to this point has had enough hubris to claim, and the second requires a level of certainty that doesn&#x27;t really exist.<p>If we&#x27;re discussing the existence of a thing that doesn&#x27;t leave evidence (god) especially it&#x27;s very fair to say you can&#x27;t prove a negative and I think his attack on this tactic is a non-starter.<p>There has never been even the tiniest bit of evidence against the existence of god. There is certainly evidence against a god with specific qualities; a benevolent god, a god that wants this to happen, etc. But if you don&#x27;t require god to have any specific qualities there isn&#x27;t a shred.",1439066038

As for the remaining half, I went to interviews, most of which went really well, only to be told weeks later that they assumed I would be able to just get the visa on my own. All I needed was for the company to be willing to sponsor me, which is a relatively easy process on their end.<p>One particular company had the guts to call me, tell me they really liked me but wouldn&#x27;t hire me because of the visa situation, and asked me if instead I could direct other people like me in their direction.

But, the scalability of your solution is only as good as the mechanisms within the language and runtime to efficiently allow developers to create a scalable system.  BEAM implements several nice features:<p>Data is immutable, so we don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping data coherent between.. anything.  Whether it is two processes or two nodes.  New data is can be constructed with reference to old data without fear that the old data will be modified.  So, &quot;mutation&quot; is really just new data with a reference to the old unchanged data.  This greatly lowers the churn in creating new data.  It also means everything can just pass (process to process or node to node) what it has without feature it will be out of date.<p>Everything is defined in modules.  Modules define what we would think of in OOP as namespaces, structures, classes/types, and class functions.  Importantly, they only define functionality.  Modules do not have state.  Therefore, functions accept some set of inputs, create new data from the inputs (no mutation), and return some output.  This makes it very easy reason about what the code is doing if you keep the modules well defined and reasonably sized.  This code can be shared around easily, too.  It&#x27;s got no state and is immutable.<p>Processes are an abstraction.  You can think of them as thread, but they&#x27;re really just a stack and and a little book keeping.  A BEAM VM will normally of real threads equal to the number of CPUs in the machine.  Each real thread will then exclusively pick a process, load the book keeping, point itself to the stack, and execute bytecode for a period of time.  When done, it will mark the changes in the book keeping, and move to the next process.  This is very lightweight, so literally millions can run on a single computer.  Because they are self contained, they&#x27;re easy to clean up.  Processes also expose standard set of interfaces for communication, a pub/sub system.  Again, immutable messages are sent back and forth.  So, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s the same node or not.<p>Finally, everything is abstracted to the notion of nodes with in a cluster.  By default, anything you executes on the local node, but you can specify otherwise.  I can execute a module call on another machine or spawn a new process on another machine.  It just means a little more information in the call, but it&#x27;s the same exact concept programmatically.  Also, it&#x27;s possible group processes into named services.  You can call a named service and it will know what processes to contact.  It&#x27;s a very low barrier to entry to parallelize your code if you just write it that way.<p>When you start thinking in terms of how structure you code for BEAM, you inherently get easy access to scalability.",1439064925

Forgive me if this is more off-topic than you would like.<p>As someone who joined the IE dev team relatively recently, I must say I had much of the same ambivalence you express in your first sentence. To add to that, I was a Mac user and moved from the Bay Area -- not exactly the bastion of Microsoft love -- and still have friends who are skeptical of my move. For me, the decision boiled down to two things:<p>(1) Web browsers have intrigued me for about a decade, and this gave me a chance to help push the web platform ahead. I love how through a process of public discussion and consensus some of the largest technology companies come together to build these (more or less) mutually compatible and complex platforms (a.k.a web browsers). Notice how I skipped past much of internet history there? You might say that, well, there are other browsers out there that I could have contributed to, and I will then ask which one do you think needed the most help? ;)<p>(2) Where would my small contribution be able to have the most impact. As you rightly point out, IE remains the most used browser (on the desktop at least) and every line of code I write may some day be exercised by hundreds of millions. I cannot emphasize enough just how fulfilling this is to me. When I was graduating and interviewing, Facebook liked to say that their user to dev ratio was a million to one, and our team easily tops that.<p>How's it like to be an engineer on this product? Lots of fun and very challenging. Much (as my limited view sees it) boils down to adding new features and/or rewriting older subsystems for performance reasons. Simple enough, but when you factor in about 15 years of legacy code, much of whose functionality has to be maintained (or emulated even in the new subsystems), life becomes very interesting very fast. I _suspect_ Firefox and Chrome are running into some of these challenges with the Electrolysis project (FF) and adding in graphics hardware acceleration (Chrome), which is perhaps why they're taking longer than anticipated.<p>Do other web developers treat me guilty by association? I don't know :)",1302929698

Haskell wants a guarantee that if some function takes a function of type Int -> Int, the passed-in function will absolutely positively not do anything in the universe except take an int and return an int, and if that isn't true and that closure can do something else, Haskell breaks. Even if you can macro your way towards restricting arbitrary closures like that, you don't have Lisp anymore; you've got Haskell. Or you don't have Haskell and you do have Lisp.

You get paid less at a relatively small company in Portland because <i>they</i> get paid less.

Certain ""party"" brands such as Bacardi target Evite on a regular basis given their obvious alignment with the audience.  The direct sales team there takes them to task on the rates in comparo with a Adwords.

Direct sell + high CPM works relatively well with a large network, affinity group of sites or a niche vertical master brand.<p>Advice (roughly 10 yrs in media/content) would be to completely own a niche or vertical with a strong brand and loyal spend-oriented audience.  This can be through traditional media, aggregation, gaming or utility.

2453180,comment,2453098,2453130,10,0,barkingcat,,,"one criteria is the prepress process. Before committing to print, good quality printers usually have a whole prepress process - from checking the correctness of file formats (I think this is why you were missing certain things on your deck - maybe they can't read your file, or had outdated and/or pirated software), to generating digital proofs - the best printers have a way to let you check the proofs before they even print up a sample. Some even let you come in and check it on their proofing workstations at their press.

 * 10.04 will continue use FF3.6 in main as long as Mozilla supports it (probably about 6 more months)
 * Once mozilla stops support for 3.6, 10.04 will switch to the latest stable (if that is FF5, that is what gets installed).<p>Seems very reasonable. Imagine if you are a huge corporation and you standardized on Ubuntu 10.04. Would you want every package to get updated to the latest and greatest each time it comes out or would you want security updates to those packages? If you want latest and greatest, jump on the 6 month cycle. If you want to get security updates for a known system, stick to the LTS. Even so, for those that WANT to get the latest of select packages, there are ways.<p>So, if you feel that having the latest and greatest for your users is important, stick to the non-LTS cycle and pick it and go. You can also install 10.10.<p>Have a look at the EOL dates...you can use 10.10 with full support until April 2012, getting you through 2 more Ubuntu releases and to the next LTS.<p><a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases</a>",1302927806

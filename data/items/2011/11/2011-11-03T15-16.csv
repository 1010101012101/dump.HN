And some people do. But most C programmers read K&R at some point, or maybe even some Linux kernel code, and so they end up valuing a style that emphasizes clarity and simplicity.<p>If anything, the sheer easiness of shooting yourself with C puts on a Darwinian pressure that causes long-term C developers to either adopt this culture or switch to something else.",1320335986

Some possible interview question might be;<p>1)Describe an algorythm? Then describe it within it's implementation.<p>2)Write a function with two parameters that returns a string in a reverse fashion.<p>3) Write a SQL queries?  Use inner, outer, and all other joins when needed depending on interview requirement of the question.<p>3)Describe dependency injection?<p>I think for the most part interview question's can either can go one way or another.  They will either slam you with conceptual CS stuff or actually have you write code.  I would look at as many question's as possible.  Then I would literally ingrain the basics of coding(In order to implement anything they ask you in the interview on the spot).  Things like loops, structures, stacks, recursion, and everything else.  Learn them and understand how to implement them at their most basic level.<p>Let them know that you are addicted to programming and learning new technologies.<p>Also get involved in as much open source projects you can handle.<p>Focus on the fact that you understand business process and how that relates to software dev.<p>Mock up some demo stuff or have a site that contains your portfolio. (Have demo of something cool for each language you know.) Take you laptop to the interview and show them your work and explain the abstraction and logic.<p>Focus on any projects you have done in the interview even if you did not get paid for them.<p>Find a solid mentor that has been in the industry for 10 plus years..  learn everything from them.<p>Put them as a reference.",1320335939

People who look down on black, consider them black (that does not mean everyone who'd call them black are racist, but that racists while grasp at the ""one drop"" pretty much immediately). Often if they try to define themselves as white they get it from both sides - a lot of black people see them as ""traitors"", a lot of white people assume they're ashamed of their black heritage and look down on them for that, or in the case of racists often take offense at it. And if they try to define themselves as black, there are people that have issue with that too, grasping at anything to write them off as ""not black enough"".<p>So for him, I guess part of it is that being ""black"" is still more convenient than being mixed race at the same time that when dealing with somewhat racist white people, trying to insist you're white or mixed when you look a bit darker than them will just make it far less likely that they'll give you any kind of respect.<p>If he'd called himself white or mixed, I don't think there's any chance he'd have gotten elected - the entire election campaign would've been massively marred by a focus on race far beyond what it was, and I think it'd have lost him votes from both whites and blacks.",1320335324

I can live with the Dock, but I'd rather have a task bar or more precisely a task bar plus a one-click way to open heavily-used apps such as is provided by both the Gnome Panel and the ""panel"" or ""bar"" at the bottom of Windows 95 through Windows XP.<p>I can't live with Apple's Expose as the normal way to switch between windows.  (And Spotlight is too slow on my 2006 Macbook as a means to switch to or start apps). To switch between windows, I use OS X's facilities for app switching, and rely on every app having only one or two windows open. To switch between apps, I use the dock or I use a function key -- four of my function keys' having been bound (using Spark) to my most-heavily-used apps, namely Emacs, browser, IM client and Finder.

Since I started running OS X, I have worked around OS X's less capable window-management facilities by upgrading my Emacs skills so that instead of using terminal windows, I now use Emacs buffers to interact with shells and other ""text-mode command-line"" programs. (There's no problem having many Emacs buffers open at the same time, and I only ever have one Emacs window (or ""frame"" in Emacs terminology) open at a time.)<p>ADDED. Moreover, when I ran Gnome 2, it was no trouble to have 3 or 4 or more Firefox windows open. One thing that makes OS X a little more comfortable for me is that when I switched from Firefox to Chrome, I stopped having dozens of tabs open with the result that I am able to manage most of the time with only one browser window open. (Fewer tabs are required in Chrome because Chrome does not have Firefox's bug in which invoking the back button or the history menu frequently takes many seconds to complete.)  In other words, I got by in OS X by rearranging my life so that I did not run any apps with a lot of windows open.<p>ADDED. None of these difference between Gnome 2 and OS X is a huge deal, but it does shed light on the quality of decision making at Canonical these days to note that they decided to transition from the Gnome 2 way to the OS X way in one of the few areas in which Gnome 2 is better. (Hmm, if Canonical switches to the OS X way of doing cut and paste, in which you have to press Command-C or Control-C to get the selection into the clipboard, that would be further evidence that they do not know what they are doing.)",1320335098

3192231,story,,,2,2,hideaway90,"Ask HN: How do I switch my career to software engineering?",,"Hello HN,<p>I'm trying to switch careers from systems integration (SI) consulting to software engineering, but I have a lot of questions and would greatly value any advice I can get from current software engineers.<p>Here's my situation:<p>I graduated from college (undergrad) fairly recently from a top 10 undergraduate business program (which also happens to rank in the top 10 for engineering). At college, I majored in business, but also minored in computer science through the school of engineering. This major-minor combination meant that my coursework involved core business classes with many business electives, as well as core computer science classes with an upper-level CS elective. I performed a lot better in the CS classes because I found the material much more interesting and challenging, and I often scored well above the curve on CS exams - even in the ""weeder"" classes. Looking back, I should have switched my major to CS.<p>As a result of my undergraduate education, I have a pretty solid foundation in computer science - OOP, algorithms, data structures, memory management etc...<p>During college, I also ran a web development business and earned a reasonable amount of money to cover my basic living expenses, so I'm very familiar web application development. This business also involved working part-time at a web technology firm creating Flash web applications (back in 2007), and working with advertising agencies to implement concepts from designers.<p>Since college, I have worked for about 1.5 years at a large SI consulting firm.  I chose to work at this firm because I thought SI consulting would be a good compromise between business and computer science. But I was wrong - my passion lies in coding and solving difficult technical problems. Many of my co-workers at this firm majored in some sort of engineering, but they work here because they didn't want an engineering job. I'm the opposite - I <i>want</i> an engineering job.<p>In consulting, it's typical for consultants to go out to dinner or to the bar after work. Instead of doing this, I come back to my hotel room (as soon as I can get out of work after an 11-hour day - 6:30ish) and build Ruby on Rails / AJAX web applications. I read HN religiously and enjoy learning about new technologies and languages, whereas the consultants I work with seem allergic to code.<p>I don't suck at consulting, either - I was rated among the top 10% of consultants at my level within the firm, but that doesn't stop me from disliking it.<p>I've tried to ""stick it out"" in my current job, but I don't see a future for myself at this firm. I don't aspire to become a manager or executive, and I don't enjoy my work.<p>Nevertheless, I understand CS very well and I've researched CS interview questions.  I'm confident I can pass a software engineering interview using pseudocode (I could probably manage in a coding language, but I don't code in my current day job, so there would be lots of syntax errors).<p>Furthermore, since I work on software implementation projects, I have a good understanding of the software development lifecycle (requirements traceability, testing, functional designs, etc...).<p>Here are my questions:<p>1.) How do I go about approaching companies to obtain a software engineering job? Is a CS minor going to put me at a significant disadvantage compared to the CS majors, given my experience?<p>2.) I apologize if this sounds arrogant or naieve (given my situation), but I want to avoid becoming a ""code-mokey"" and work somewhere with opportunities for advancement. How do I avoid ""dead-end"" coding jobs? (or do they even exist?) Please set me straight if I'm completely off-base here.<p>Thanks for reading, and thank you in advance for your advice.",1320334554

It means I don't have to keep it in working memory. I just press back when I'm done.<p>I also disagree with Gruber's complaint:<p><i>Heres one thing I dont like about the Android Back button that Ive never seen a counterargument for: it presumes that you, the user, remember the activity stack. If you turn your phone on and youre looking at a web page in the browser, if you dont remember what you were doing immediately before opening the web page youre looking at, you have no idea where youre going to go if you hit the Back button. Could be another app, could be another web page, could be the home screen. And if hitting the Back button takes you somewhere you didnt want to go, theres no Forward button to reverse it. Its like leaving a breadcrumb trail in the dark  you have to remember where the breadcrumbs are because you cant see them.</i><p><a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/02/defending-androids-buttons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/02/defending-androi...</a><p>Actually, I think what's nice about it is that you <i>don't</i> have to remember the activity stack. You just hit back if you want to go to the previous activity, and if you don't want to go to the previous activity, you go to the home screen. Why would you hit back if you didn't want to go to the previous activity and also didn't remember what the previous activity was?<p>Here's a common analogous scenario for me. I unlock my phone to a web page. I finish reading the web page and then go, ""How did I get here?"" I hit back, which usually takes me to the previous web page, to google reader, or to twitter. I then go on with what I was doing, probably skimming feeds. It's a great, natural workflow that allows me to pick up exactly where I left off.<p>I wonder how Gruber manages to use web browsers' back buttons without getting confused. I mean, when you hit it, it can go to SOME RANDOM WEB PAGE!<p>As for the forward button, it's just a matter of hitting the exact same link or button that you did the first time. Forward is redundant.<p>And of course, if you're ever confused, you can just hit the home button and start over. This is your <i>only</i> option in iOS. If you get routed to twitter from another app, and then you want to go back? Hope you remember what you were doing before. In fact, you'd better <i>make sure</i> you remember if you want to get back. Because you're going to have to go back through the home screen to get there.<p>In my scenario above, ported to iOS, if I wake up my phone to a web page, I basically have no way to go back to the activity I was doing before the web page except to just remember. That, to me, is a much worse workflow. There just aren't any breadcrumbs at all.<p>I also don't think there's any way to get rid of the OS-wide buttons, because there are basically two axes of navigation. There's the OS wide one along which the back button acts, and there's also the in-app one that takes you between panes of an app. Swipes already move you between panes. How can they also move you back in the activity stack?<p>I do agree with you that icons are outdated. I hope Android steals more from Windows Phone 7. Those tile are gorgeous.",1320334402

Please let me hide in your house"".<p>You haven't adjusted to the spontaneous time travel or meeting the living dead very well, and you're staring without answering for too long; he continues: ""It's only for a couple of days until I can make a run for the continent. I guarantee you with the power of suspended disbelief that none of your neighbours or the police will ever know"".<p>""But it's just an enquiry"", you say, ""that's what the police do all the time, at this stage there's nothing to fear.

What I'm saying is, it's a bad law, will you help me escape the consequences?"".<p>""No, no I wont"", you reply, ""I want to live in a society with a rule of law. This is the law and you should be tried by it. It's the correct thing to do according to this system"".<p>He pauses a moment, then ""Think of the public humiliation, the jeering and mocking. They'll chemically castrate me, they'll make my life not worth living, the resulting depression leads to my /suicide/. They'll as good as kill me themselves!""<p>""Ha ha ha. Alan, m'boy, nevermind the jeering, and your resulting /death/. Think of the alternative! Your suffering is surely better than /anarchy/"".<p>""I'm a real human, it's real personal suffering here, and on the other hand, your ideology!""<p>You reach for your cellphone to call the police. ""If it's any consolation, Alan"", you say, giving him a hearty slap on the back, ""I think it's despicable too"". Your cellphone has no signal - the past, again. You look around for a phonebox.<p>""'s easy for you to say, you're not the one being involuntarily sacrificed to someone elses political ideology under rules they don't even agree with themselves"". He jogs across the road. ""Why do you think it's useful to call it despicable if you go along with it regardless?""<p>""I don't know"", you answer, ""maybe I'll reply to this comment and explain it"".",1320332830

3192088,comment,3190738,3191417,1,0,cousin_it,,,"Many online forums today are plagued by pointless repetitions of very weak arguments without any systematized attempt to make them stronger. For example, ""underrepresentation implies racism"" is a very weak pro-PC argument, easily sniped by any anti-PC debater. I wonder if the pro-PC crowd ever came up with a strengthened version of that argument?<p>More generally, maybe discussions of controversial topics would benefit from detailed argument maps where each side can state their actual best response instead of the watered-down version. Have you seen the detailed map of William Lane Craig's Kalam argument for theism, which he used to beat Hitchens and other prominent atheists in debate? No one should ever need to restate or re-refute weak arguments when stronger versions are available.<p>My personal impression is that anti-PC arguments tend to be slightly more robust than pro-PC ones, when strengthened as much as possible. But a systematic mapping attempt could very well change my opinion, because I'm probably not even aware of the strongest arguments for either side.",1320332767

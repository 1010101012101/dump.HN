And one could make the argument that the sample of men was also biased--towards men who liked tech.<p>No one claimed this was an iron clad peer reviewed scientific study--and I&#x27;d love to see some done on this in addition to those that already exist.  Deborah Tannen is one of the more well known researchers in this area to uncover distinct gender patterns in speech that affect performance, for example.<p>There are now hundreds and hundreds of data points, and anecdotes.  At what point is there enough evidence to convince some people that there IS a problem, and believe those of us who have experienced this exact phenomenon?<p>TBH this response is exactly what I thought I&#x27;d see on hacker news: attack the methodology, thus missing the forest for the trees.",1409266716
8240187,comment,8237064,8239889,4,0,bkirkbri,,,"I have a pet theory that the reason that women (as well as non-traditionally-masculine men) are considered bossy, while other men are considered &quot;go-getters&quot; is due to a lack of the threat of violence. Not that a type-A guy is going to assault you if you don&#x27;t capitulate to their authority. More that there is a perceived or possible threat.<p>In contrast to women who would be considered bossy or abrasive because they don&#x27;t &quot;back up&quot; their claims to authority. I suppose that there is often a feeling of resentment that society/culture/custom is taking the place of that threat.<p>Again, all supposition and musing on my part.

My experience is that even if people aren&#x27;t <i>trying</i> to be jerks then the quality of books inevitably goes down over time as people take the things they find interesting and replace them with things they find less interesting. You might think that since different people find different things interesting that this might work out in the end, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to.<p>Add to this the fact that some people <i>are</i> just jerks and will take books without replacing them, plus a bunch of people who see this as an opportunity to promote either their self-published books or their own political opinions, and you get a bookshelf rapidly being denuded of popular books and filled up with political tracts, dated &quot;how to&quot; books and obscure genre novels from the 1970s.<p>Compare this to, say, an ordinary public library, which allows you to freely borrow any one of many thousands of well-catalogued books as long as you return it in a few weeks.",1409266553

Neither of them are nothing. The connection between 0, the empty set and nothing is that the empty set contains nothing (no elements), and its cardinality is 0. There is also a connection to propositional logic: we can universally quantify a negated predicate to say that nothing exists which satisfies a certain property.<p>One question is, can we work with an actual nothing which is not &quot;wrapped&quot; in the empty set.<p>We could try to postulate a nothing object such that when a set is constructed which contains that object as an element, it is the empty set (and still has cardinality zero). Just like every set has the empty set as its subset, every set has the nothing object as an element.<p>This nothing could simultaneously serve as an additive identity, and as a multiplicative identity: a plus nothing is a, a times nothing is a.  (This works in Lisp, by the way: (* 42) is 42, and so is (+ 42).  We can pretend there is a second operand there after 42, and that operand is nothing: it doesn&#x27;t extend the length of the argument list by one. Also, nothing plus nothing should be zero. Nothing times nothing should be 1. This is needed so that (a * nothing) * nothing is equal to a * (nothing * nothing) so associativity of multiplication is preserved. (Lisp is with us here again: (+) -> 0, (*) -> 1.)<p>It&#x27;s a matter of going through all the grunt work to see whether the formalism can be used in a way that is consistent: does its presence lead to theorem-wrecking contradictions.<p>The question of whether we can work with an &quot;unboxed&quot; nothing, of course, does not address the philosophical question. Any formalized nothing that we use is actually a something: a syntactic and semantic concept denoting the idea of nothingness. When we think of it, we are not thinking nothing; our minds are not blank. It is not wrapped in an empty set, but it&#x27;s still boxed in a framework.

On top of that, I applied to YC with the same idea in the last round and got rejected. However, it is a business and industry that I spent significant amount of time understanding, networking-in, and developing. As a result (especially in the last few months) there is extremely good clarity on how to succeed in the market along with potential resolution with some of the business issues in the next few months (most likely after the YC application is due).<p>On the other hand, I have another startup idea which I have a prototype and some #&#x27;s on product/market fit, but not much more than that.

It’s likely they will offer me a role in the AdWords sales team which would interest me but having spoken to existing people in the sales team, I am beginning to think it’s not for right role for me.<p>My passion, however, is in startups and I’ve dreamed of moving to the Valley to join a startup and soak up the entrepreneurial spirit and network among the people I have read the blogs of for so long. In the past I’ve worked at a fast growth tech startup in a European Incubator (business development) and loved the challenge and the fact I could make a big impact.<p>Do I take the ‘ok’ role at Google for a few years and enjoy the perks, stable pay, and brand recognition? Or do I follow my dream now and join a startup in the Valley? It’s hard to turn down Google (my parents can’t understand why I would even think about doing that) but I know I’ll end up in a startup anyway so I feel ‘why wait’- join one in a years time.<p>It’s important for me to move to San Francisco- I feel I need to experience it at least for a few years. I’m interested to hear your thoughts based on your experience on what would be the best way for me to develop my skills out of college.

This is also true of REM sleep; additionally you often remember dreams.<p>Stage 2 is also good. A good 30 minutes afterwards, you will feel better rested, and your mental acuity will rise; for longer than from stage 1, but it is a delayed effect.<p>But if you wake up out of a deeper sleep cycle, you get &#x27;sleep inertia.&#x27; Mental acuity plummets. You feel poorly rested and ill.<p>The problem:<p>The body is often not even aware that you are sleeping in stage 1 sleep. You are in a different physiological stage, but you may not have lost consciousness.<p>You usually are in this stage from minute 5 onto minute 10. And in stage two up to about 15-20 minutes.

And even then, there&#x27;s the fracturing problem, which despite Alcor&#x27;s handwaving, is a serious problem.<p>> By the time you have the biological machinery to repair the kind of damage that thermal stress fractures, residual ice and cryoprotectant toxicity causes, cancer will be a curiosity in the bookshelves of history.<p>It&#x27;s a very big assumption that we&#x27;ll ever have the machinery to repair the damage caused by the freezing process. But apart from that, there&#x27;s real and rapid decay of tissue in the brain when a person dies. Loss of even a small percentage of brain tissue has seriously traumatic effects on otherwise healthy people who haven&#x27;t been frozen.<p>It&#x27;s probably not gonna work.",1409263800

First I read the previous comments here, then I read the fine blog post by Peter Frost.<p>It is correct that Charles Spearman originated the current, generally accepted view of &quot;general intelligence&quot; (<i>g</i>) as a common factor for diverse mental abilities tapped by a variety of mental tests. Each kind of mental test, in Spearman&#x27;s view, also tapped &quot;special abilities&quot; (<i>s</i>) and Spearman, contrary to the brief account here, elaborated his view of those in the years after his landmark 1904 publication on general intelligence. Spearman wrote, in a 1927 writing I&#x27;m indebted to John Raven for drawing to my attention, &quot;Every normal man, woman, and child is, then, a genius at something as well as an idiot at something. It remains to discover what—at any rate in respect of the genius.&quot;[1]<p>The article continues, &quot;In recent years, however, we’ve begun to identify the actual genes that contribute to intelligence. These genes are very numerous, numbering perhaps in the thousands, with each one exerting only a small effect.&quot; The second sentence quoted here is a lot more accurate than the first. We know FOR SURE that genes that influence human intelligence number in the many hundreds, with confusing interactions with one another and with differing environmental conditions, and also know for sure that none of those genes have a large effect acting alone. But we have barely begun to identify any of the individual genes.<p>Blogger Peter Frost then comments on some current primary research publications. As someone who regularly discusses current research with other researchers in the local journal club,[2] I&#x27;m always glad to see citations to some new primary research studies, but I&#x27;ve also learned how few of those replicate, and how limited our precision is so far in matching behavior patterns to gene assemblages in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in human subjects. The sample sizes are becoming more and more huge in human GWASs, but are still too small to provide reliable data on associations between genes and behaviors of interest.[3]<p>The unreplicated primary research studies he cites (in some cases from very obscure journals) will be worth following up on, but right now I think the blogger&#x27;s suggested conclusions run ahead of the evidence, particularly about spread of literacy in some regions being associated with particular genes--the sample sizes of the relevant populations are still grossly inadequate for backing up conclusions like that.<p>P.S. Reliable information about the neurological underpinnings of reading ability can be found in the book <i>Reading in the Brain</i>,[4] by a scientist who has done many neuro-imaging studies of reading ability, a very readable and interesting book.<p>[1] <a href=""http://assessingpsyche.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/strawman-spearman-vs-charles-spearman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://assessingpsyche.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/strawman-spe...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.psych.umn.edu/research/areas/pib/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psych.umn.edu/research/areas/pib/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3778125/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3778125/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm</a>",1409263223

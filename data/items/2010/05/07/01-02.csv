1326443,comment,1324692,1325079,0,0,CamperBob,,,"<i>But back to your point, the toll roads I travel on charge more for semi-trucks than they charge for passenger vehicles.</i><p>Yes, because the semis cause more than their share of road-maintenance costs.  This is akin to charging me 2x as much if I want to upgrade to a pipe that's 2x as fast.  Nobody has a problem with that.<p>The problem happens when the government sells the tollway to a private corporation, who then starts up its own trucking line.  The road's new owner charges its own trucks $0.25 and everybody else's trucks $5.00.  How could you defend that?<p><i>I wonder why we believe it is okay for the govt to meddle in some areas and not others? Where and how do we draw the line?</i><p>This isn't even a new question.  There are some interesting parallels with the early telephone switching system.  About a hundred years ago, an undertaker named Strowger noticed that his competitor was getting all the calls whenever someone kicked the bucket.  It didn't take much investigation before he discovered that Betty the Switchboard Operator was the sister-in-law of Bob the Undertaker at the competing funeral home.<p>Nowadays we're faced with the exact same scenario, but due to the logistics of the last-wire monopoly, we can't solve it by inventing a new switching system like Strowger did.  That's where the government has a legitimate role to play.",1273196860

You're not the normal use case though, even at the office.<p>At work I probably have SQL Server Management Studio open, a tabbed text editor, Visual Studio, a Terminal Services client, an IM client, Chrome and MSIE both open, Outlook, several internal apps developed for our trading workflow and monitoring, internal design documents, specs and documents from data vendors... etc.  My average window count is probably 16 across three displays, and I'm just a developer.  Even in most offices that's absolutely abnormal.  Heck, in your average office <i>multiple displays</i> is incredibly abnormal.  I've worked in other quant shops and I remember in one even the guys driving the company's bottom line were given just a single 19"" display.<p>But that's fine.  I don't need most of that at home.  At home I get by with a browser, iTunes and occasionally a Terminal Services client.<p>iPads aren't going to replace desktops for doing real work.  They can't.  They never will.  However the average user -- and the average power user most of the time -- doesn't need a desktop either.  I'm pending a home hardware refresh.

1326403,comment,1325758,1325758,0,0,derefr,,,"My advice, which isn't so much advice as a recollection of what worked for me, on my own self-taught journey to programming enlightenment:<p>Before learning <i>any</i> language, first learn some DSLs, like ActionScript or Processing; they'll give you 100x the sense of ""instant gratification"" (really just a good feedback loop, to avoid learned helplessness) of general-purpose languages.<p>Then read a book on C; but don't bother trying to ""learn"" it yet. You won't get it, not at first. Then learn Javascript and PHP (and SQL), and use them until you get tired of Javascript's missing standard library and PHP's disorganized one. Quit using PHP; quit using Javascript for now. Read the C book again. Also read a book on Lisp.<p>Learn Python or Ruby now. Now read the C book one more time. This time you should understand it.<p>Now's a good time for a university education, if you'd like, or algorithms/data structures/discrete math books, if not. Become really good at creating normalized data structures and efficient indeces for them (to the point where you stop craving ORMs and NoSQL.) Learn to cache data.<p>Learn the sundry unix shell scripting languages (basically trying to live anything resembling a normal life on a non-GUI Linux set-up will force this on you, so that's a good proximal reccomendation.) Try to code some sort of compiler. Realize that, despite knowing however many of the algorithms involved, there still seems to be something magical about them. Learn an assembly language, and how the dynamic linker/loader, executable object format, and virtual memory subsystems of your OS work. Grok that compilers just do clever string processing, and write a simple one. Learn to cache instructions, and make your compiler do a few optimizations.<p>Keep learning other languages until the Lisp book makes sense. <i>Then</i> pick a language to work in, for you are now a Journeyman.<p>(If you'd like to like Javascript again at this point, learn Smalltalk or Lua, or look at how MOOs work. If you'd like to ever like C++, learn Haskell first and treat C++ as a compromise between it and assembler. Don't bother liking Java or C#, but learn some language on the JVM/CLR so as to like managed code in general.)",1273196043

Every time we do it, we find that the #1 reason is: ""Scribd gets me readers"".  Not ""it hosts my docs for free"", or ""I like the display format"", or whatever.  Readers is what they want, and so we have worked very hard to maximize the number of readers we can get them.<p>I think file hosting sites are great, and Scribd is not attempting to replace them, they just serve a different purpose.  If you want to share a file with a few friends, a file hosting site makes a lot of sense.  But if you want to build an audience of strangers, posting on Scribd gives you a surprisingly good change of doing that.<p>If you don't believe me, try posting some doc you've written on Scribd.  You will probably be surprised by the number of random people bumping into your document brought by related doc traffic, Scribd community traffic, search engines, Facebook, Twitter, our mobile apps, and all the other ways we make Scribd content discoverable.<p>re 2)\nAbsolutely.  Scribd isn't trying to be a content discovery site - other sites do a great job of that.  Rather, if we've done our job right, then when you bump into interesting links on Digg and Reddit, some fraction of them will happen to be hosted on Scribd.  Now that we've launched the HTML5 reader, you will hopefully enjoy clicking over to Scribd to read the document that Reddit surfaced for you.<p>Re making Scribd a ""high-end"" brand - I think that is a terrific idea.

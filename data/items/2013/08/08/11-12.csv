In reality, government is just a bunch of people with a lot of self-interest fighting for power here and there between each other. But all of them are interested in keeping this myth going that because there are > 1 power-hungry guys it somehow represents &quot;checks and balances&quot; for a worried general public. It&#x27;s a joke.<p>Government is a violent institution to extract resources from unarmed people under a promise of &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;interests of the nation&quot;. Being a &quot;democracy&quot; its nature does not change. Only extreme risks like &quot;dictator kills 100000 people at once&quot; are reduced, but the nature is the same: the will of people to command violence (politicians) and the will of bribed others to execute it (cops and army).<p>Just check the news about <i>anything</i> that people don&#x27;t like about the government. E.g. NSA scandal. What do the branches do? There&#x27;s a &quot;secret court&quot;, congress does not care to fight against NSA and every government official still extracts your taxes for the same NSA, judges and congressmen.",1375963176

That would means that the data goes away as the container gets updated (if you just replace the old container with a new one). Or do you just never replace the whole container but just update what&#x27;s inside? Or would you mount a device of the host? Does the container get access to device nodes of the parent?

6178186,comment,6178051,6178051,10,0,derefr,,,"> docker is just slightly further along the spectrum than Xen: instead of using a special guest kernel, you use the host kernel. Instead of paravirtualisation ops, you use a combination of cgroups and lxc containers. Without the direct virtualisation of hardware devices, you dont need the various special drivers to get performance, but there are also fewer security guarantees.<p>No. People seem to be really confused about this. Docker is a <i>container standard</i>, not a virtualization system. The thing you can download on the Docker website, besides being a toolchain for creating containers, is a <i>reference target</i> for containers to deploy to, which just <i>happens</i> to (currently!) use cgroups and lxc and aufs overlays.<p>The point of Docker is to create one thing (basically a container file format + some metadata stored in a &quot;container registry&quot;) that you <i>can</i> deploy to all sorts of different places, without changing what&#x27;s inside it. In fact, one of the goals of Docker is precisely that the reference target (cgroups+lxc+aufs) could be entirely swapped out for something else in the next version of the Docker toolchain, and none of your containers would have to change.<p>Docker containers <i>will</i> be deployable as Vagrant boxes, Xen VMs, AWS instances, whatever. Targets that have an overlay filesystem will use overlays; targets that don&#x27;t will build a flattened filesystem image from the container stack. Targets that have paravirtualization will rely on their host kernel; targets that don&#x27;t will rely on the kernel in the container&#x27;s base image. And so forth. It isn&#x27;t possible <i>yet</i>, but that&#x27;s the entire goal here.",1375959742

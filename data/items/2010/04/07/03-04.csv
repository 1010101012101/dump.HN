They tried to give students a better mathematical foundation for more advanced maths that ended up backfiring politically?  Namely they were teaching rudimentary set and number theory to K-5 kids.  This came at the expense of kids ability to multiply and divide, and when the press caught wind of this, the program was quickly shut down.<p>It seems like any attempt to restructure the math curriculum will be met with massive resistance from parents who were eminently satisfied with their own (likely poor quality) math education, and want their children to have the same.",1270612688

1246424,comment,1246125,1246125,0,0,tokenadult,,,"It's time for a favorite quotation about mathematics again:<p>""What should every aspiring mathematician know? The answer for most of the 20th century has been: calculus. . . . Mathematics today is . . . much more than calculus; and the calculus now taught is, sadly, much less than it used to be. Little by little, calculus has been deprived of the algebra, geometry, and logic it needs to sustain it, until many institutions have had to put it on high-tech life-support systems. A subject struggling to survive is hardly a good introduction to the vigor of real mathematics.<p>"". . . . In the current situation, we need to revive not only calculus, but also algebra, geometry, and the whole idea that mathematics is a rigorous, cumulative discipline in which each mathematician stands on the shoulders of giants.<p>""The best way to teach real mathematics, I believe, is to start deeper down, with the elementary ideas of number and space. Everyone concedes that these are fundamental, but they have been scandalously neglected, perhaps in the naive belief that anyone learning calculus has outgrown them. In fact, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry can never be outgrown, and the most rewarding path to higher mathematics sustains their development alongside the 'advanced' branches such as calculus. Also, by maintaining ties between these disciplines, it is possible to present a more unified view of mathematics, yet at the same time to include more spice and variety.""<p>Stillwell demonstrates what he means about the interconnectedness and depth of ""elementary"" topics in the rest of his book, which is a delight to read and full of thought-provoking problems.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/</a>",1270612247

Granted, only co-authorship, and I don't have the leverage of a Stephen King.<p>Still, from all I've heard, getting as high as 45% out of a traditional publisher is pretty rare.<p>Plus the other benefit you get, in addition to the rather high royalty, is the ability to totally bypass traditional publishing process. It's just 'vanity publishing' but with Amazon behind it. Which is good and bad, of course, but can still be pretty attractive.<p>Another factor: yes, you could keep 98% if you truly self-published, digital only, rather than only 45%. But you get potentially a larger number of eyeballs, and they're making printed books, not just PDF's. Paper is cheap. Assembling and shipping a book, not so much.

I finished college and worked at a few large companies, doing mostly unrewarding work and not really challenging myself.  By age 30 I felt I was at an impasse, and needed to either apply myself or drift along from job to job.  I think the final tipping point was the arrival of my first son.  The combination of wanting to do better and provide for my son was a powerful one.  I ended up losing 50 pounds, getting back to my highschool weight, and working on projects that interest me.

If I had to go back and give one piece of advice to that boy, it would be - Relax a little and don't be too harsh on yourself, especially with those expectations. There is _no_ rush. You have much time ahead of you.<p>Quarter-life crisis is more common than you think. While the reasons do not matter much, in my view, high expectations (not bad) and impatience are the culprits. Life is a long journey and learning to navigate the ups and downs is a skill learned only through experience.<p>In many ways, this is what entering adulthood really is about :) You no longer have the structure of school, and as you said yourself, the highs and novelty of grad school, your first job have started to wear off. It happened to me too. You are lucky to have a girlfriend who has known you for long. Don't let this feeling affect a precious relationship, first and foremost. If you have a right-brained friend, a guy, who has known you for a while, talk to him. Male camaraderie & bonding is something different altogether.<p>I hate giving you a list of ""things-to-try"" but this is what I've learned - ""changing things up"" is one of the most effective ways of pulling yourself out of this. Your mind needs fresh fuel. It needs to see and experience new things. It is a feedback loop. Your mind will automatically give back to you great motivation, new ideas, and happiness if you feed it with something new.\nSoon after I turned 26, I backpacked by myself for a bit around Europe. It was one of the most defining and amazing experiences of my life. Take your girlfriend along and go travel a bit if that seems possible. My travel energized me so much that soon after I returned, a new venture idea dawned on me and gave me a strong purpose.<p>It is difficult to find meaning and purpose in modern life. Expectations are high, and we see media-fueled stories of 20-something millionaires all the time. That's a rarity.<p>Most importantly, let life unfold. Life is long (no matter what you hear otherwise). It is a journey. Embrace the uncertainty of what is yet to come. If you stay on your feet, let yourself gravitate towards new experiences, and let them permeate you, the flow will be smoother. Remember that there is no rush. There is no deadline to get to a certain place. There should be no I-must or I-have-tos, especially in this phase. You don't absolutely _have to_ find a strong meaning and purpose to everything just yet. It will come. The 20s are some of the most wonderful years of our lives. Take a few risks, have new experiences, form some amazing memories.<p>You seem like a fairly cheery guy prior to feeling like this. I see what you are feeling as more of a transient phase in the journey of life. It happens to all of us. Everyone. I speak from experience, too. And believe me, when this phase passes, you will have been glad you went through it. It will define the man you become. It will be good =)<p>Good luck!",1270611161

After playing around, she understood that not only was it not going to just break on its own, but also if it did, she could just ask me and I'd fix it, and no one would know.<p>By the end of the season, she had become the person everyone else in the school came to for help, not because she was better with computers, but because she was less afraid of them, and understood that it was a simple causal relationship - you do something, the computer responds. She began teaching the other teachers how to do things, giving mini-lessons or fixing their problems.<p>This is why I feel the iPad is going to be a hit. It lets you do quite a lot of what the typical person does on the internet, but at the same time, you CAN'T damage it, except physically. You can't break the OS, you can't get a virus, and you can't do most of the things I see computer users have problems with. You'll never 'lose' an app because a shortcut disappeared, you'll never lose a document because the 'Save As' dialog opened up somewhere new that one time, you'll never download the 64-bit version of an app on a 32-bit OS, or install a 32-bit OS on 64-bit hardware.<p>When users aren't intimidated by the computer, they can do great things.

The chairwoman and CEO Irene Rosenfeld (already not a good sign, best practice is to separate the two roles) was awarded a 41% pay increase, bringing the total to $26 million for 2009  for her “exceptional role” in the Cadbury transaction, as well as her “commitment to fiscal discipline.""<p>...\n""The punchline is that Kraft actually screwed up. Part of their plan for Cadbury involved closing off the company’s pension plan but there’s “an obscure clause in Cadbury’s pension trust deed that makes it almost impossible to close the scheme.” As a way ’round this obscure clause, they’ve issued an ultimatum to employees, threatening them with a pay freeze unless they “voluntarily” agree to opt out of the pension plan. Point being that no matter how obscure the clause may or may not have been, this is supposed to be part of your due diligence before you buy a company, to say nothing of “exceptional” performance""",1270610576

Twitter plans to move its Tweet storage to Cassandra. Suffice to say that Cassandra is young and the reliability of Cassandra with our throughput and our (very very large) corpus can use some improvement. Cassandra is not yet ready for production use at Twitter despite the fact that it has been deployed successfully at Digg and elsewhere. The Cassandra community is improving the database very rapidly. In a year or two I expect Cassandra to be a reasonable option for many popular web sites. But, even then, Cassandra's design has certain limitations that might prompt you to design a custom store (or consider alternatives). And indeed, there is a lot of stuff we have at Twitter that we have no plans to store in Cassandra unless there are substantial design changes.<p>An advantage of Gizzard here is that it is more flexible. You could, for example, build a document-partitioned inverted index with Gizzard such that you could do local intersections on each shard and merge these intersections in Gizzard itself. You might, in fact, use Gizzard in front of Lucene to do just this. There is no way to do that with Cassandra though perhaps they will build such features in the future. (To anticipate an objection, Lucandra is not document partitioned so it will suffer from fundamental efficiency problems for a certain class of search queries.)",1270610454

Dad was in the Army with orders, and they let him/us stay where we were until I was born, then two weeks and go. I moved with my parents a lot in the Western US and Hawaii. The I joined the Navy, saw the world from Virginia to Hawaii to Kenya, and moved duty stations with my first wife a lot in the process.<p>I did all that by the time I was 24, lived in Seattle 15 years then moved to Denver, where I've been another 15 years. I'm in my early 50s now. Besides the moving, I've lived what I think of as four fairly different lives, different friends, jobs, interests, relationships.<p>I say all that partly to acknowledge that I look at moving and changing differently than a lot of  people. It's not a big deal to me, and I usually look forward to it. It's difficult for me to understand what it's like to live in one place most of one's life, so my perspective is probably different than yours.<p>All that said, when I look back at how much I've moved and settled comfortably, I think at your age you have more than enough time to move somewhere, decide you don't like it, and move again.

When I went to school they checked attendance 6 times every day (once for every class), and gave you 3 bathroom breaks/year/class. Taking attendance took about 5 mins/ class, every time you went to the bathroom a teacher had to sign a form verifying you had permission. This comes out to about* 340,000 HOURS of wasted time in ONE YEAR FOR ONE HIGHSCHOOL. This isn't even considering many, many fundamentally wrong things with how grades and classes are structured and credit is awarded. For every competent teacher teaching a useful subject there are 3-4 incompetents wasting people's time with sophistry and selectively blind adherence to stated rules.<p>Public high school education in this country is a net negative. High school ""education"" has nothing to do with teaching students skills, its there first to benefit the people running the school, and second to make people obedient for factory jobs.<p>Math & science people tend to be humble & introverted because they're usually wrong about the solution to whatever problem they're trying to solve, and they spend all their time doing math/science and not talking to people.\nThis is a bad thing. Every hour spent on spiffy presentations is an hour not spent on telling people public school's are doing it wrong. The author wasted his/her time on this* * , it's not going to change anything. Math/Science people who want to improve the state of math/science education should spend their time politicking, not science'ing.<p>* (5mins/attendance * 6 classes * 10 mins bathroom break form filling/a day * 2000 students * 34 weeks/year / 60mins/hour = 340K)<p>* * It is pretty cool, though.",1270609296

Way too much clicking and page jumping, and then it looks like I have to fill in dates too that I’m not sure I can pull out at the top of my head.  I think the UI for that could be a lot better and can fit on one page.<p>I’m down with the idea, though.",1270609200

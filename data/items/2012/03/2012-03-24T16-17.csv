The OP point was kernel can have exploit so kernel is inferior than ZeroVM.  My point kernel can exploits, so can ZeroVM.  You just don't know yet.<p>2. DOS on ZeroVM indirectly DOS on the host.  There are so many way to DOS a system.  How do you handle an app running in a tight loop access all the memory randomly?  Queuing the max payload in a tight loop?  Spawn off new instances across the entire cluster in a tight loop?  Claiming DOS can happen in kernel and not possible in ZVM is just naive.",1332608369

3749805,comment,3748401,3749592,2,0,blahedo,,,"> <i>How is the task heterogeneous?</i><p>Within a single course, the heterogeneity comes from how to actually do things, how to understand what you did, how to understand what <i>other</i> people are doing when they do the same things, how to think about changes to those patterns when the task changes a little, how to write about what you did, how to <i>talk</i> about what you did, how to read/listen to other people talking about what they did, and many other aspects of understanding the material.  None of these are actually the same thing; the unifying thread in a given content area is you might have to memorise the same jargon and diagram conventions for each of those different tasks.<p>A given course may also be somewhat heterogeneous in its content; for instance, a typical AI course might include algorithms and strategies based on discrete probability, others based on highly-architected structural representations of knowledge, and still others based on self-rewriting code.  At a lower level (high school), you might consider a biology teacher, who gets to cover cellular biology, taxonomy and cladistics, genetics, anatomy and physiology, and possibly some other things I'm forgetting right now.<p>Between courses, teaching is heterogeneous because you're teaching a lot of different things.  Even if it's all ""math"", for instance, there's a fair amount of variation between algebra, geometry, logarithms and function analysis, differential calculus, vector calculus, trigonometry, and probability and statistics, and that's just among the courses often taught at the high school level.<p>And all of that is <i>only</i> talking about the things taught, which speaks directly to the question of evaluation.  But on the subject of heterogeneity, classroom dynamics can vary significantly just between semesters at the same school, not to mention between different schools, and within a single classroom you have students with assorted learning disabilities (documented or not) and simply different learning styles—some are more verbal, some need to see it done, some need to do it on their own first, some benefit more from working together, some really need to try it first and crash and <i>then</i> hear the way they were supposed to do it and try again.

The goal of Java was to build a language that runs everywhere, and to facilitate Sun's ""everything(your watch, toaster, pc) is networked"" ambition.<p>All the things that people flout about Java saying that how it helps them manage large projects(completion, re-factoring, ide integrated debuggers, good libraries) wasn't even a twinkle in anyone's eyes who was involved with Java development. Java's initial release was terrible - it didn't even have decent stdout facilities, was interpreted and as a result dog slow, took a long time to load the jvm, and essentially failed it's ""write once, run everywhere"" motto as it became ""write once, debug everywhere"" in practice.<p>Java has evolved, mainly because people bought in the hype. I don't know why people stopped questioning the hype.<p>""Look, we are totally object oriented.""<p>I am not sure what it means for me as a developer. So, what about classes? Are they objects? Packages? Are value type objects?<p>""Ummm. No it doesn't matter. Just listen to us. We are object oriented.""<p>""Our goal is 'write once, run everywhere.""<p>Your awt looks like dog shit on both windows and linux, and is slow.<p>""Hey. We didn't say anything about 'looking good'. I can bet it looks equally crap. That's platform independence.""<p>> In some ways that sounds terrible by itself, but I think it turns out to be legitimate.<p>If that's the actual goal, it isn't terrible at all. Why do you think writing large programs quickly is a terrible goal?<p>> I've been on python projects that need to grow but struggle b/c all the things that make it easy to get a lot done the first few weeks become liabilities very soon.<p>And those things which make it <i>easy to get lot done in first few weeks</i> but are liabilities would be?<p>> Adding developers to a project that doesn't declare types and encourages just passing around hashmaps is brutal.<p>I understand time complexity, space complexity, and api of dictionaries. If you needlessly wrap it in your class, I couldn't know anything without reading through your wrapper. What exactly do you gain by wrapping dictionaries?<p>> All the stuff you can't do in Java makes it easy for someone else to understand it and edit it.<p>Examples please. If your developers have an easier time understanding implementing an interface to sort, rather than saying persons.sort(key=lambda a: a.name) then I don't know how that can be remedied.<p>> I would believe that C# might be a bit better but only being fully supported on MS is a non-starter for many server side situations.<p>The list of things which aren't supported on mono is small, and basically includes things which won't run outside of windows(office interop) or are deliberately dropped(WPF).",1332605599

It was a combination of an office building that was repurposed, a county government that was expanding very quickly, computer equipment that was taking more room and a government contractor under pressure to keep things running while the expansion was going on.<p>I don't believe the county government fined itself, but, things did change. It was the only building other than the courthouse in another city where we didn't run plenum rated cable. After the incident, all cable we ran was plenum rated.<p>It was the wild west back then. 143mb hard drives were the size of file cabinets, 67mb removable disks had 5 platters and weighed about 20 pounds. PCs were just starting to come into play, but, the mainframes and minicomputers took a lot of space. The tape library was easily 300 sq feet. When we needed more space, we asked the county, they would move whatever office group was adjacent to the computer room and the space would be expanded. There wasn't a lot of documentation at the time regarding best practices.<p>I never really felt that I was in danger, though, at 18, you sort of feel invincible anyhow. Had the computer room been built properly and not been converted office space, it wouldn't have had a drop ceiling and the outcome may have been different. Had the system been sized properly for the expanded room, perhaps things would have been different.<p>Edited: even though the mux we were using was a 32 channel mux, probably eight or more of the ports would have been 1200 baud for printers.",1332605535

Online education can potentially be pretty good at helping students learn (although, even at that, it's much weaker at helping the less-self-motivated students learn; you might regard that as either a plus or a minus, I suppose).<p>It's a lot less good at verifying it, especially if there's credentialing involved.  As soon as the verification becomes high-stakes (due to a resultant credential---grade, course credit, etc), cheating becomes a big problem, and one not easily surmounted within the context of the online learning environments that have sprung up so far.<p>So if something like Thrun's class is really going to ""change higher learning forever"", one of those changes may have to be a separation of the teaching/learning component and the verification/credentialing component.  The teachers could then say, learn it or don't, I'll help but I'm not your taskmaster... and then if the students want to prove to anyone else that they learned something from it, they have to figure out some other way to do that, because transcripts won't cut it.<p>Actually, I could kind of get behind that.",1332604857

Seatgeek was one, where you were asking about their algorithm.  That's important stuff, especially when judging a startup. Some might feel startups on the stage there should not be put under the gun, but that's silly.  If these are truly 50 of the best startups out there, they should be prepared for questions like this.",1259441976

965493,comment,965297,965297,0,0,blehn,,,"Andy's thesis, ""Creativity is not design,"" is pretty obvious. I'm not sure anyone ever defined creativity as design. What I think he means is, ""Design is not creative,"" and I think that's pretty short-sighted.<p>Design is not art, it is, however, problem-solving, and being a good problem-solver requires a capacity to <i>think</i> creatively.  Creative design doesn't mean ignoring accepted principles of hierarchy, spacing, etc.  Design goes deeper than that.  For example, think about the way that Google has implemented it's own cross-browser CSS button style. The button doesn't <i>look</i> very different, but Google designers were smart enough to know that the variety of default browser buttons detracted from their brand.  Google designers (very creatively) devised a solution that is lightweight, accessible, looks the same across browsers, etc.",1259441338

965491,comment,965270,965270,0,0,Dove,,,"It's a decent idea in principle, but I'm not sure how well this would work in practice.  I can think of two problems.<p>The first is distraction.  When I am working on a difficult problem, it's true that I often need periods of inane distraction interspersed with periods of extreme focus.  In theory, taking care of a child and hacking could be combined; where I go for walks or play video games now, I could be playing patty-cake.  But those breaks need to occur when I intellectually need them, not when the baby needs them.  When I am madly coding something I understand well, I very much need to avoid distraction.  When I am mulling over something I don't understand, I very much need to embrace it.  So I suspect this would not work well in practice.<p>A second problem arises from simple physical compromise.  I am presently seven months pregnant, and--much as the admission grates on me--I have found my performance slipping throughout.    Sometimes because I am tired, sometimes because I am forgetful, sometimes because I am more excited about the coming baby than the current project, sometimes because half a dozen random things are wrong with me physically and discomfort is . . . distracting.  I had hoped to keep working at full capacity, and while I've kept working full <i>time</i>, I have to be honest: I haven't been as effective as I once was.  Where I used to produce a couple brilliant ideas a day, now it's more like one or two a week.  I don't see that improving just after the trauma of birth, during the subsequent hormonal adjustment, and what with the excitement and distraction of <i>having a baby around</i>.<p>Programming is an activity that depends so much on mental sharpness; where caffeine and sugar are performance-enhancing drugs, insomnia and strange hormones are remarkably destructive.  On a bad day, I can spend 8 hours not-quite-achieving what should be half an hour's work.  Mundane programming I can usually still do, but great hacks?  Not so often anymore.  Nor do I see them recurring with regularity for a while.  No doubt about it, being a mother is a sacrifice intellectually.  All indications are that it's well worth it, and I wouldn't do otherwise.  But it strikes me as unrealistic to suggest that it's a light side-activity that one can casually combine with a serious commitment to work.  Even very intellectual work.",1259441285

When she is playing she likes to have my attention, when I sit at the computer she would come and show that she wants that I take her on my hands, I can read Hacker News or something but usually I can do programming only when she is asleep which is now two times a day about 1/2 - 1 hour, and often she gets asleep when we are on the daily walk - then this 1/2 hour of my time is lost.

Pretty but poorly-designed websites often under-perform by a factor of 10 compared to industry averages, for metrics as simple and basic as bounce rate or conversion rate. Just with exposure to some of the basic stumbling blocks I've seen sites trip on, I have enough domain-specific common sense to figure out about half of those questions.<p>I think the author exaggerates the divide between creativity and design, although not by much. I couldn't make a web site to save my life, because my creativity is zero, but when someone else makes one I have enough of a sense of design to know what they did wrong. So creativity is still necessary in design work.",1259439772

965468,comment,965203,965370,0,0,PieSquared,,,"Ergh! Sure, some of these things are true, but some just <i>reek</i> of a stubborn refusal to do things the way the language intends for them to be done.<p>Note how instead of saying, ""Ocaml doesn't have with-open-file or unwind-protect"", he says, ""Here's how you have to do with-open-file and unwind-protect in Ocaml"". No! You do not go around trying to turn other languages into Lisp if you want to code in Lisp. If you want to code in Lisp, you code in Lisp.<p>Similarly, he just dismisses the syntax as ""pretty much unreadable"". Bollocks. The language syntax is fine. Sure, it's different from what most people are used to, unless said people have used SML or Haskell. But it's a decent synatx - yes, with it's own quirks and problems - which is most certainly not ""unreadable"".<p>""No Polymorphism; Cannot add an int to a float - need an explicit cast"" - what he means to say is that it's a very strong-typed language. If you use the ""O"" part of ""Ocaml"" (Objective Caml"", polymorphism exists and works.<p>Now, a lot of his points are valid, like the one about the standard library. But in general, I feel that he really discredits himself by his persistence in writing Lisp code in Ocaml. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.<p>(Disclaimer: I've used Ocaml, but not to any grand extend. Maybe 10,000 lines of code written in it. Paradigm-wise, I'd have to say I might prefer Lisp, although I find that CL is slightly annoying often times.)",1259439188

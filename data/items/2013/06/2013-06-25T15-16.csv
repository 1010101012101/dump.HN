If you don&#x27;t trust the NSA&#x27;s oversight,  then you should assume they keep everything for ever and taking issue with them being able to eavesdrop so easily.<p>If you do trust the oversite, it makes sense that they keep encrypted data around since they have no easy way of knowing if its from a US person or not. Once they decrypt it and find out it is a US person, thats where you should focus. It should be as if they collected US Person data originally and should count it as collected when they actually got it, not decrypted it.<p>As to the argument that the NSA could count anything as encrypted. Yep, they could. See point one.",1372175994

5940382,comment,5939498,5940305,4,0,greghinch,,,"Without knowing more about the OP&#x27;s business it&#x27;s hard to say for sure, but I can give some thoughts based on my own experience. I&#x27;m going to assume they are a B2B company of some kind based on the limited description. In this capacity, when you are starting out, often you have a very small customer base. You likely know each of your customers individually. And as individuals, they have their own thoughts and opinions about how they want a service like yours to function. If you&#x27;re not careful, you end up becoming something more akin to a consultant than a vendor. Your service becomes tailored to the specific needs of one or a few customers.<p>The problem is, when you are going for growth, you can&#x27;t focus on the needs of one. You have to be able to take a higher level view, and build a product that can do the most for all of your customers. Sometimes that means cutting features, or at the very least making changes. If you had a product which was tailored for one customer, that fact may very well be quite limiting to expand to many more customers. Even if you build something that <i>could</i> do just as much for that early customer, the fact that you had to make those changes may be enough to sour the relationship and end it.<p>Again it&#x27;s hard to know what happened in this specific case without details, but I would wager it was something along those lines. It&#x27;s a decision not to be made lightly, but one you&#x27;re likely to face as you grow a B2B service.",1372175986

There are few concepts required to understand it:<p><pre><code>    (function arg arg) ; is the default form
</code></pre>
And every form is passed to eval, which calls apply, which calls eval... until you get to a fully expanded form and the final call to eval.<p><pre><code>    (map #&#x27;my-func &#x27;(1 2 3 4)) ; might eval to

Behind the scenes, its a different story.<p>So yeah, the NSA and he government are trying to present a Church of England tea and cakes at the afternoon garden party type of image. Of course they are. Meanwhile the people questioning this setup are trying to present an image people need to be worried about. The media then just present these extremes, and the citizens are expected to pick a side. As both sides become increasingly extreme, the issues loses credibility and gets swept aside by the next big news splash. while the relatively few people who actually care eventually disperse wonder what the hell just happened. This is the exact same pattern we see on almost every issue. Where is Occupy now?<p>This issue&#x27;s only real relevance is as another example of the broken bond between those who govern and the people. And Im not sure there ever was any such bond. Lets face is, the government is basically the formalization of the rule and maintenance of the powerful over the population. There was a balance, they did used to realism they had to keep us broadly happy, in order to keep their power in place. But I think now, they are so arrogantly confident in their manipulations that they no longer care.<p>Heh, its like the old saying: No matter who you vote for, the government always get in.",1372175014

We have more like 6-12 months of runway left but things aren&#x27;t looking good.<p>Our path tracks your alternate reality.<p>I started a project several years ago that took off. It wasn&#x27;t meant to be a business at the beginning but once it started getting traction I slowly devoted more and more time to it.<p>It was &quot;profitable&quot; from the first day; the Adsense ads more than made up for the costs of hosting it and the initial design work. I programmed it myself so there was no development cost.<p>From the beginning it snowballed. It had a thousand users the first week, ten thousand the first month, and 50k users 3 months in. It was at that point that my amateur coding got in the way and the server crashed and burned.<p>By this time the business was making about $300/day in advertising. The costs were basically zero (a single virtual server + me part-time while I was still in school).<p>In retrospect this is the point I wish I had dropped out of school, raised some funding, and started building a development team. But I didn&#x27;t; I read up all I could on scaling and hacked together some more code. That helped the project grow to a million users by the end of the first year.<p>By this time I had added in for-pay features to the free product to augment advertising and was making well over $1000 per day. I started plugging some of this into advertising to accelerate the growth but most of it was being distributed to me as the only shareholder. Things were going peachy until the servers crashed again.<p>Again, I read up on scaling, bought a couple hours of consulting time, and patched things up. Within a few months the advertising spend had paid off and at the peak the project was raking in $20,000/day (most funneling straight back to me since at this point it was just me [still part-time] and a couple of part-time customer service reps). This was where the project hit its peak of about 1 million monthly actives.<p>And, of course, the servers tanked again. This time by the time I was able to get things stable again the market was not as good and we weren&#x27;t ever able to get back our exponential growth.<p>I wish I had at the very least &quot;gone for it&quot; and plugged the profits back into the business to hire people to help me. It was about this time that my competitors were discovering the same things I had been experiencing (easy viral growth, cheap user acquisition) and raised about 100 million in VC funding to buy up and saturate the market.<p>Long story short, we stagnated and slowly declined (no longer able to compete effectively with our newly extremely well-funded competition). Our competitor who raised 100MM in VC is now a public company with several billion in market cap, and there are several others who took a similar path that are worth in the range of a billion as well.<p>By the time I decided to hire and build a team it was too late to make much of a difference.<p>I made a couple million bucks and had a fun ride but I&#x27;m still kicking myself for not seizing the opportunity to go all-in while the window was open.<p>We&#x27;re now playing catch-up but the market is more fully developed now and it&#x27;s harder for underdog players to get an upper hand.",1372174414

The problem is that, since there&#x27;s no built in concept of separation, you have to enforce it yourself.<p>A lot of code written by beginners (myself included, once) will put business logic as close to where it will eventually be rendered as possible, so you end up with code that looks like this<p><pre><code>    <ul>

Why does a customer care? What does this do for them? How is this different than what e.g. Monster or CareerBuilder does? Emphasize benefits you provide that sites like that don&#x27;t.<p>2) Work on your branding and elevator pitch. What brief phrases explain what you offer and why it&#x27;s awesome? How can you quickly communicate this in 48-point font or giant colorful illustrations, and then back up with more text addressing a customer&#x27;s needs?<p>I feel like your branding/message suffer from Prospect being a common term, and all the Prospect info being hosted under &#x27;Human&#x27; (another common word), not being on its own site. Hard to have a uniform top-level message.<p>3) Work on your pricing grid. This is a key step of your sales funnel; literally no one can become a customer without seeing it. I would flip the grid into the more common vertical format; you can search for &quot;four column pricing grid&quot; for advice here. I would consider naming the 4 plans, offering a discount to those who buy longer plans (and show the discount!), and add a &#x27;start now&#x27; etc call-to-action button for each plan. You don&#x27;t want this grid to be dull or a dead end.<p>4) Marketing ideas: I might continue to sell personally until you have some decent stats to speak of, in terms of # of jobs posted and # of job seeker subscribers.

They believe that Snowden has reduced the effectiveness of these tools.<p>For example, most people know we have spies.  But I think these same people would be upset if someone said, &quot;We have two spies in Pakistan working with this group.  And a common technique for this group is to infiltrate via this mosque, where we have several spies, etc...&quot;.  While this isn&#x27;t a list of the names of the spies, people would probably believe at even this high level of specificity that the effectiveness of their intelligence gathering would be reduced.<p>I personally have mixed feelings about it.  I do think that to the extent that the gov&#x27;t is doing something illegal, whisteblowers should be empowered to stop it.  On the other hand, I think the capability of our intelligence gathering should be as secret as possible.

What the Polish writer Tadeusz Borowski called &#x27;the incredible, almost comical melting pot of peoples and nationalities sizzling dangerously in the very heart of Europe&#x27; was perilously rent with riots, massacres, and pogroms -- but it was real, and it survived into living memory.<p>Between 1914 and 1945, however, THAT Europe was smashed into the dust.  The tidier Europe that emerged, blinking into the second half of the 20th century had fewer loose ends.  Thanks to war, occupation, boundary adjustments, expulsions and genocide, almost everybody now lived in their own country, among their own people.  For forty years after WWII Europeans in both halves of Europe lived in hermetic national enclaves where surviving religious or ethnic minorities -- the Jews in France, for example -- represented a tiny fraction of the population at large and were thoroughly integrated into its cultural and political mainstream.  Only Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union -- an empire, not a country, and anyway only part-European -- stood aside from this new, serially homogeneous Europe.<p>But since the 1980s, and above all since the fall of the Soviet Union and the enlargement of the EU, Europe is facing a multicultural future... voluntary and involuntary migrants from failed or repressive states at Europe&#x27;s expanded margins have turned London, Paris, Antwerp, Amsterdam, Berlin, Milan, and a dozen other places into cosmopolitan world cities whether they like it or not.<p>This presence of Europe&#x27;s living &#x27;others&#x27; -- perhaps fifteen million Muslims in the EU as currently [2005] constituted, for example, with a further eighty million awaiting admission in Bulgaria and Turkey -- has thrown into relief not just Europe&#x27;s current discomfort at the prospect of ever greater variety, but also the ease with which the dead &#x27;others&#x27; of Europe&#x27;s past were cast far out of mind.  Since 1989 it has become clearer than it was before just how much the stability of post-war Europe rested upon the accomplishments of Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler.  Between them, and assisted by wartime collaborators, the dictators blasted flat the demographic heath upon which the foundations of a new and less complicated continent were then laid.</i><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>On my trips to Europe I have seen students in Prague (none in Plzen), Arabs in Paris, some British tourists in Ljubljana.<p>Overall I was not surprised to learn that when Poles gained the right to emigrate by acceding to the EU, the richer member nations were swept by waves of anxiety over the arrival of a slightly different kind of white person.",1372173437

We wanted it to be a paid service. Our only competitor was a paid service. But when we looked around, we saw ludicrous valuations per user for users that provided little to no revenue. And the VC&#x27;s saw it too. And everyone were seduced into going for a free service and figure out monetization later. So that&#x27;s what we did.<p>Of course the bubble burst, and the lofty valuations disappeared, and we had to hunker down. The business survived, but we fired 45 or so people - the vast majority of the team, and the VC&#x27;s lost most of their investment.<p>I have two big takeaways from that experience: Be conscious whether or not you want to gamble. A gamble can be worth it, but you may be much happier building a company that&#x27;ll stand a reasonable chance of giving you steady returns and pay you a salary than taking a long shot at millions. We started out wanting that reasonable chance, but got seduced into the long shot without really thinking about it.<p>Secondly: Keep in mind the VC&#x27;s often have a vastly different risk preference than you. A founder is usually investing all his/her time in a single business, often for years. A VC spreads their investment over a wide range of companies, and spreads risk accordingly. For them, it&#x27;s not such a big deal if a few of their portfolio companies fail, if they get the occasional massive return, so it may make sense for them to be willing to take risks with your business that are not in <i>your</i> interest.<p>It&#x27;s vitally important to think through how much risk you&#x27;re ok with <i>before</i> going out and getting investment, and to look for money accordingly, as well as consider how much control you&#x27;re willing to give up depending on how aligned you think your interests are with the profile of any investors you bring in.<p>Failures makes valuable lessons (and I&#x27;ve had more lessons...).",1372173423

5940010,comment,5933557,5934164,2,0,electronvolt,,,"I&#x27;m sorry that you have cancer.  It&#x27;s a terrible disease that nearly took a parent from me (it had metastasized before it was caught; my mother was incredibly lucky).  I don&#x27;t intend to trivialize it by any means, but I do think it&#x27;s important to compare it to something like bipolar disorder.<p>Malignant cancer will probably either be dealt with or kill you on a time scale of 5-10 years, and although mortality rates vary, your chances of surviving many forms of it, particularly if it&#x27;s caught before it metastasizes, are decent.  Yes, there&#x27;s a chance that it has gone into remission and might come back, but that chance goes down every year it hasn&#x27;t happened, to the point where you&#x27;re generally considered &#x27;out of the woods&#x27; if you&#x27;ve been cancer free for more than 5 years.  It&#x27;s in many ways an acute disease:  you have it, and it either kills you or you get better.  Treatment is acutely unpleasant, but unlikely to kill you and although it can leave you with health concerns (if I remember correctly, it can cause osteoporosis in some people), for the most part you are done with it after less than a few years of chemo+radiation therapy.<p>Compare that to being diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 20.  Life expectancy in the US is almost 80.  You don&#x27;t really get better from bipolar disorder: you can be stable for a long time, but you never get to the point where you&#x27;re considered to be &#x27;out of the woods&#x27; with regards to having more mood episodes.  That gives 60 years of dealing with a disease that has a high mortality rate and incredibly unpleasant symptoms; mania sounds great until you realize that it can mean experiencing full blown psychosis:  walls melting, seeing people where they aren&#x27;t levels of crazy.  About one in three (25% to 50%) of bipolar patients attempt suicide at least once; one in five will die from suicide.  As has been pointed out elsewhere, that is a higher death rate than some cancers, and that is -one of- the ways it can kill you.<p>The treatments, too, although not as immediately unpleasant as chemotherapy, are honestly potentially worse and cause more chronic concerns.  They can cause other chronic problems that can kill you (liver failure, weight gain, weight loss, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, lithium toxicity/lithium, weight gain, diabetes, associated heart issues/depakote+antipsychotics, PCOS in women/depakote) or be debilitating (dystonia, tardive dyskinesia/antipsychotics).  It should be a sign of the severity of some symptoms that it&#x27;s considered an acceptable trade off to have muscle spasms or uncontrollable facial movements for the rest of your life, sometimes in ways that are debilitating enough that you won&#x27;t be able to walk.  Note that these aren&#x27;t the disease, these are the side effects that&#x27;re considered &#x27;less bad&#x27; than experiencing the actual symptoms of bipolar disorder.  Many of them are permanent and will continue even if the medication that caused them is stopped.<p>These are some of the -common- serious side effects, not all of the common side effects (there are lots of other common ones that effect quality of life, including hair loss, sexual dysfunction, memory failure, etc.).  With regards to rarer side effects, lamictal can (rarely; 1 in 1000 or 1 in 10000) cause your skin to fall off, particularly if your dose is increased too quickly.<p>Schizophrenia is generally worse than bipolar disorder, and the treatments are often similar (less lithium, more antipsychotics).<p>Both are chronic conditions that, when they are bad, can keep you from working, finding housing or living a normal life for however much longer you live.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t wish cancer or bipolar disorder or schizophrenia on anyone.  But I&#x27;d probably wish for cancer over severe bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.",1372173241

You are going to clash with the professional rules.<p><i></i>*<p>>New York rules do not permit a pure referral fee  that is, a fee for merely referring a 
client to another attorney. (Some states do permit such fees under certain circumstances; as an 
example, New Jersey court rules permit certain attorneys who have been certified by a state board 
to provide a referral fee to another attorney without regard to the amount of work performed or 
responsibility assumed by the referring attorney [N.J. Rule 1.39-6(d)]). The governing New York 
rule is DR 2-107(A), which provides:<p>A. A lawyer shall not divide a fee for legal services with another lawyer 
who is not a partner in or associate of the lawyers firm, unless:<p>1. The client consents to employment of the other lawyer after a 
full disclosure that a division of fees will be made.<p>2. The division is in proportion to the services performed by each 
lawyer or, by a writing given the client, each lawyer assumes joint responsibility 
for the representation.<p>3. The total fee of the lawyers does not exceed reasonable 
compensation for all legal services they rendered the client. [1]<p><i></i>*<p>The job of a lawyer is not merely to act as a &quot;broker&quot; who develops business and then sells the client to specialists who will pay her the biggest fee[2]. Referrals are a part of the profession, yes, but the emphasis is not on making money but rather directing your client to the best person for the matter because you have the duty of acting in the client&#x27;s best interests. The referring lawyer should still do work on the case after the referral in order to accept a fee, too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/LawPracticeManagementResources/Feesharing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/LawPracticeManag...</a><p>[2] Of course, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with being a lawyer who  counsels clients on picking the best lawyer for the job, or provides access to their network of contacts. However, the client should pay for these services (hourly or fixed), not the referee. When you sell the lead based on a referral fee there is going to be a conflict of interest and keep in mind the lawyer has to get the client&#x27;s consent to this division of fees.",1372173239

It&#x27;s that they referred to themselves as World Champions.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s interesting to me, the fact that this type of attitude can even exist.<p>Whether or not a team can be called a world champion is probably up to two factors:<p>1)  Is their league the best league in the world?<p>2)  Is there no truly international competition that would be acknowledged as having a similar or higher level of competition?<p>For example, for soccer and MLS, the answer is no for both questions because the World Cup and the Euro tournament are tops, with the World Cup being number 1.  Even the Olympics can&#x27;t come close precisely because FIFA disallows their best players from competing in the Olympics in order to make the World Cup a more spectacular event.  And the MLS certainly isn&#x27;t up to par with leagues in Europe.<p>For hockey and the NHL, the answer is yes for both questions because the only other regular competition that comes even close is the IIHF World Championship, and it is a sub-par level of competition.  The NHL tried to make their own World Cup a regular event with attendance from multiple nations, but failed to sustain it regularly.  If they had succeeded, that World Cup event would probably be able to say that they crowned the real World Champions.  The Olympics are the only thing that comes close, and that is heavily contingent on the NHL&#x27;s willingness to send their players to the Olympics, which the NHL has repeatedly stated is an undesirable burden for them.<p>For baseball, I think it&#x27;s clear that the World Baseball Classic trumps MLB on both questions, and it helps a lot that MLB is a big contributor to the tournament so that the best players are sure to be there.<p>For American football and the NFL, there&#x27;s no argument.  Superbowl = World Champs hands down.<p>I&#x27;d say likewise for whoever wins the NBA championship.<p>But there&#x27;s a difference between knowing that you won in the best league in the world and are probably the best team in the world and actually publicly calling yourself the best team in the world when you didn&#x27;t compete with anyone from other nations.  The debate is further confused when teams have international players, so are players representing their cities (as in league championships) or their countries (as in the Olympics, World Baseball Classic, World Cup)?  It&#x27;s a lot of comparing apples to oranges, so the whole debate is very muddied, and sometimes I wonder why we even care about it.  But the debate is what it is.<p>edits for clarity",1372172763

Lesson: VCs want founders to take larger risks with their company for the reward of a larger payoff. If the founders don&#x27;t want to &quot;bet the farm&quot; like this, then they probably shouldn&#x27;t be seeking out VC money, or at least wait until they&#x27;re profitable enough to have a lot more negotiating leverage.<p><pre><code>  > I didnt believe the shit I was selling investors.

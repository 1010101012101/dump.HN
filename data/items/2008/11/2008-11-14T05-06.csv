364022,comment,363778,363976,0,0,kiplinger,,,"What are you on? I ask because in another post you say ""real estate"" will lose 50%, if that is true, then you have a severe price drop in a non liquid asset, also if the recession is as severe as you say it will be, then people will not be spending any money on goods which will drive the price of most goods down resulting in a period of immense deflation, which can be equally damaging.<p>I don't have an advanced degree in econ like you may, so I don't really get what you are saying but you seem to be ""amused"" by being overly negative. you are making Roubini sound like a shiny happy person.",1226641013

364011,comment,363815,363954,0,0,jonknee,,,"As I said, I usually buy what's on sale (it really is a good way to keep up variety). When chicken breast is on sale it's usually pretty good, in the $2-3.50/lb range which is about half off. Whole chicken is almost always economical. That said, there are a lot of other cuts of meat (pork chops, roasts, etc). After the holidays you'll be able to pick up turkey and ham really cheap. I got a ham last year and threw a party, it was ridiculously cheap and delicious. It's all about being flexible, if you're alright with going with the flow you can get away with spending much less than you'd think.<p>It's a fun challenge for me and I've come up with some fun recipes as a result. That said, I do splurge where it counts--good quality olive oil, parmesan, fresh herbs, etc. At the end of the day I'm in it for a tasty meal, not a cheap meal.",1226639746

364003,comment,363270,363425,0,0,tdavis,,,"I have had less than stellar success with multiprocessing in non-trivial applications. There seems to be a lot of undesired ""magic"" going on, such as workers having access to global imports which causes all sorts of issues. If I want a worker to have access to a module, I should have to import it in that worker. The irony in trying to make a multi-processing module <i>stop</i> sharing state isn't lost on me.<p>I didn't actually read this article because it basically sounds like ""this is a myth because of the GIL"" which is just downright moronic. I completely disagree with the idea that concurrency is a ""myth,"" I do however believe that it can be more trouble to successfully implement than in other languages designed for concurrency, even if (theoretically) all the tools are there.",1226639313

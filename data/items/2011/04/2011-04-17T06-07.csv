However what surprises me most is that if they ever want to be adopted on a large scale the clients ought to be better than this.

2455708,comment,2454493,2454493,3,0,CountSessine,,,"<i>The iPhone, revolutionary as it was, didn’t alter one underlying dynamic: Phone manufacturers—who wanted to make the most capable, feature-rich phones—were still at odds with the carriers that provide the pricey bandwidth to power those features. That had led to conflict between Apple and its carrier partners, especially AT&T. Apple wanted users to take full advantage of the iPhone’s capabilities, but carriers then had to spend billions to keep up with the demand on their overtaxed networks. Android finally rewrote that calculus. Because carriers get a cut of app sales and ad revenue, they stand to make money when subscribers surf the web or download applications. For once, the interests of software designers, manufacturers, carriers, and customers are all aligned.</i><p>This is so ridiculously wrong - and anyone who had to do j2me development for applications for all those silver clamshell phones that we all had before the iPhone knows it.<p>The carriers ALWAYS took a big cut of your application revenue. Wanted to sell a BREW app to Verizon customers? Verizon took a very healthy chunk of your little program's paltry purchase price. What was genuinely different (and refreshingly so) was the iPhone's software market - Apple told the phone companies to go to hell.<p>Does anyone really remember just how bad all of this was before the iPhone?",1303022602

Assuming the engines can scale behind the scenes for us, how many cores would be needed?<p>This would change everything, especially for the iPhone's walled gargen (unless new apps appear that require the extra power - perhaps console-quality games? complex visualizations)<p>Intel managed an amazing trick, of keeping demand for more processing power strong for decades (from 1978 to 1998; when the celeron was introduced, for the market that valued low price over performance; and 2008, the Atom for low power consumption over performance). But to really compete against ARM requires letting go of  the blessing and the curse of back-compatibility - which Intel hasn't succeeded at so far (see Itanium). The demand for performance seems to be ending, and I expect with it, Intel will also - perhaps by 2018.",1303022424

There are a couple of differences re:the environment in Singapore vs the Valley. For starters, students here prefer interning at banks, or other 'proper companies', as opposed to startups. Second, the startups themselves are often very new to the game. (Founders asking for NDAs are still a fairly common occurrence.)<p>2. Google SoC is doubly attractive because of the exchange rate. USD5000 is a big thing when compared to the market rates in Singapore, and that still doesn't factor in the benefits of learning from a large, well-managed OSS project.<p>I wrote this primarily as a response to the number of companies that hit the NUS Hackers mailing list with off-the-mark ads. I'm not sure if this would help other companies looking to recruit hackers, but hopefully the context would give you enough information to decide for yourself.<p>Plug: NUS Hackers is a student organization dedicated to the spread of OSS and hacking in the National University of Singapore. We're affiliated with the Singaporean Hackerspace (<a href=""http://hackerspace.sg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerspace.sg/</a>) and both organizations would be more than willing to show you around/lend you some help/introduce you to people, should any HNer choose to drop by Singapore. :)",1303021080

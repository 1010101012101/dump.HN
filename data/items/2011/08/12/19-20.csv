2878974,comment,2878264,2878279,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"Film guy here. It wouldn't be that hard to fake. angle of the sun/direction of shadow is easy to keep consistent, motion blur is wholly automated these days (as in, select start/end frame & position, and motion blur will be on by default in most programs with excellent results). Although the camera is moving slightly, the distinctive and structured shapes of the batting nets provide perfect tracking points for trajectory mapping; alternatively, you could shoot at a higher resolution from a tripod and then introduce some floaty movement afterwards, windowing onto a smaller frame at 1:1 resolution. Making the nets bounce is trivial, you just need a couple of takes from the same camera position. As long as the light isn't changing, it's astonishingly easy to key stuff in and out from different frames - typically used to remove people or vehicles, but just as easy to introduce them. So it's possible that this is a film school/enthusiast project; I'd say it could be done in a single day on an average workstation.<p>On the other hand, the guy may just be a good batter. Bouncing a ball off 4 nets will rob it of a lot of speed, and if one practices a lot it's not that hard to get a rhythm going. When I was a teenager I used to kick a soccer ball off a wall for practice, and my aim was kick it back 100 times, starting over from 0 if I lost it. I wasn't all especially good or dedicated, so I have no problem believing this would be achievable by someone who's serious about the sport. Jugglers have to perform far more complex movements at much faster speeds, for that matter. Finally, for all we know this could have been the 10th or greater attempt to pull this off.<p>So either is possible. I don't feel like downloading the video and stabilizing it to do a windowed frame diff, but if you wanted to get forensic on its ass the best place to start would be to measure the # of frames between hits, because you're got a nice marker from the noise of the bat; if it's exactly the same more than 3 times in a row suspect a fake, likewise if you see a repeating progression of frame intervals like 23-25-24-23-25-24.",1313179187

I argue that this restriction is meaningless, because it has no technical impact in this patent. Even when the patent seems to try to be a little more broad, by trying to describe the data structure itself, this description also depends on traversal and nothing else: ""[claim 1 ...] said primary function pointer functioning as a primary linked list to direct a computer program to a first sequence to _traverse_ said computerized list [...]"" (x2 because the same thing is written for the ""auxiliary"" list, then x3 in claim 2 for the ""tertiary"" one).<p>There is never any interaction described between one list and the other -- so from the point of view of patenting I don't see anything difference between this patent and a mere description of basic single linked lists, description centered on its traversal (the various enumerations are to be considered as irrelevant in themselves, and are not supplemented by anything else).<p>That reason alone would be one of the major angle of attack of the patent, would it not be already even more basically invalid because of triviality and prior art. The only challenge would be to present those formal concepts using casual language clearly enough so that nobody would mistake this description as the description of a new structure (even in the hypothetical alternate universe where nobody ever previously used two lists at a times for ordering the same sets of elements)<p>There is no meat.",1313177856

I don't understand the insistence on real names, not just because I think it's wrong, but I just don't understand what the motivation is. What's the upside?<p>Here's the only thing I could come up with:<p>Community. This early in its life, they don't want Google+ to become a cesspool of fake/joke accounts, youtube comments, spam, and ""brands."" They want it to be a real place for real people to share about real things. They don't want it to become Myspace. [Edit: I think you can also see this emphasis on noise reduction in how Circles are set up and how game notifications aren't part of your stream unless you want them to be.]<p>But I hope the plans are bigger. I hope they're just going for a nice clean introduction for a large enough user base, while temporarily marginalizing edge cases in order to give the mainstream a pleasant initial experience, so they can leverage that user base into a more successful version of what they tried with Buzz and Wave: an open, standards-based interoperable social networking environment that's more like the open web than a closed social network.[1]<p>The fact is, if they're planning on opening it up eventually, there's no stopping pseudonymous/anonymous activity or brands or even spam to some degree.<p>That's my optimistic fanboy take on it. I just don't see what else they get out of the policy. I definitely don't buy the ""it's for advertising"" line. They don't need your real name for that. And it just seems like too much of an obvious backlash and logistical mess to have to deal with unless they have a good, large, long-term reason.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/07/google-plus-social-backbone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/07/google-plus-social-backbone...</a>",1313177005

Let's take a more plausible scenario than one in which the account was opened for fraudulent purposes from the beginning.  Let's imagine our business owner has had every intention of running a legitimate business and has been doing so, but as a result of personal misfortune is now in a state of desperation.  Would it really make sense to torpedo a running business in order to get a final payout of maybe 50,000, and put oneself very much on the wrong side of the law in the process?  For 500,000, I could see this, but I don't think many people, even those desperate or venal enough to ignore the ethical difficulties, would do it for an amount comparable to a year's revenue from a business they've worked for years to build.<p>Or conversely, if there really are fraudsters with the patience to run a legitimate business for six years in order to run a large scam, surely they would also be shooting for a payout well into six figures if not seven.<p>I think PayPal has made the considered decision that it's not worth their time to think about individual cases.

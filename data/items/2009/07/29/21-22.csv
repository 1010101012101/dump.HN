This is an extremely high price, which is orders of magnitude higher than the alternatives: bicycles, motorized bicycles and scooters, motorized skateboards, etc.<p>The high price instantly relegated the product into a niche. At that price, the Segway is only viable for businesses (consumers can't afford it) that can really justify the need for the product.<p>Imagine for a second that the first Segway came out at a price of $1000, and that the price gradually dropped to $400 - $500. I think a good number of early adopters would have bought the first dorky-looking version. These people would have used the Segway, and some would have complained about the look. Some people would have started customizing it and making it look cooler, go faster, attach jets to it, etc. Gradually, the manufacturer would have listened to the customers, and would have started making many versions of the product, some for kids, others for teens, adults, etc. They would have created off-road extreme versions of it and one-wheel versions of it.<p>Basically, I believe that there is a healthy demand for getting around town quickly, and that if the price of the Segway was right, the mass market would adopt it. Mass market adoption would then quickly iron out the dorkyness of the Segway though many iterations of the product.",1248903327

731108,comment,730801,730801,0,0,schacon,,,"I think the reason I don't like the GPL is that it is aggressively pessimistic. If you release your code under MIT or BSD and _ask_ people to contribute back if they improve it, most people actually will - I don't think I've ever used GPL and I've gotten hundreds of patches for projects of mine.  People don't contribute to open source because they're forced, they do it because they want the network effect of everyone else contributing and they want the software to be better.<p>However, GPL says ""I don't trust you, and I don't trust you so much that I'm going to legally severely limit what you can do with my code unless you promise legally to share my philosophy"".  It's not only frustrating when you're trying to figure out what you can and can't do with it, but it just seems kind of mean-spirited.  It implies that they feel that if they don't legally force you to, you'll try to take advantage of everyone, which is sad.<p>Maybe I want to use a library for a commercial application and would then be able to spend part of my work day improving it - if it's GPL, it's use is not even an option assuming that the company will not open source the main product, if it's not GPL than both the library and the company benefits.<p>I guess at the end of the day, I just don't care if someone takes advantage of some of my code - several of our GitHub competitors use our MIT'd Grit library we use to run their own sites, but honestly we don't really care - we'd rather have a larger user base and volunteer pool and let even our competitors be able to contribute back than shut everyone out because we are so distrustful and protective of our code and time.<p>I just think that asking is more effective than threatening, and to me the GPL is threatening.",1248903080

The author set people up with a computer game where the goal was to run around and collect as many points as possible.  Bags would randomly appear, you would collect them, and that would get you the points.  Different rooms had different rates of points appearing, and some rooms would produce higher value objects, etc.  He tried a variety of scenarios to see how people would behave; one involved a door to another room (which might have more earning potential than the current room) that you could travel through at the cost of a certain number of points.  If you didn't go through the door, it would eventually disappear.  He found that people, even after finding that the room that the door led to was worthless, would still waste time and points to keep the door open.  Nobody wanted to let an opportunity, even a poor one, pass.<p>I think this explains the (predictably) irrational hatred for the GPL; it makes doors close, and that is something we are apparently hard-wired to hate.

5791648,comment,5790508,5790508,8,0,drostie,,,"So, two years ago or so I started a project in the middle of my Master's -- not a great time to focus purely on that project. The idea was to replace Node.js's callback hell with Scheme-type promises (i.e. deferreds), ideally preventing most applications from writing `function callback(err, value) {}` ever again. The Promise library was not bad and I might reuse it in other applications; it's only 250-ish SLOC if my memory serves me correctly.<p>But I quickly realized when <i>using</i> it that the project could not live up to my earlier ambitions. The problem was that I hadn't foreseen the problems in not being able to overload JS operators: something like half of the Promise library just wrapped the JS operators, so that `this.gt(that)` becomes a deferred representation of `this > that`. This kind of worked, but I began to lose interest in this general approach when I started to struggle with how to idiomatically represent (a) variables, (b) if-then-else constructs, which are right now of the form promise.then(promise_if_truthy, promise_if_falsey), and (c) composite statements.<p>Fortunately, I found the right thing to study, and off-and-on for the past year I've been studying it. The right thing to study in this case is Haskell, because the way that Haskell reduces 'do notation' to a pure sequence of function applications is precisely what you need above to solve (a) and (c) at least.<p>Another idea was to take a revision control system like Darcs and try to move it, as much as possible, out of the realm of IO so that it could work on an arbitrary in-memory data structure as well. (I might then try to move it back into IO by storing the internal representations in a database, which would probably look a lot like a graph database or like Datomic) This is a great idea but it has stalled because the handling of dictionaries requires 'confluently persistent tries'. There's a great paper on these by Erik Demaine et al., where basically they make functional link/cut trees and build the system out of those, then optimize them to languages which aren't functional as well. I say 'there's a great paper' on it but actually that paper is an incremental result, not a tutorial -- so while it looks really interesting it's required me to learn a tremendous amount of new concepts before I can even implement it.<p>What I am trying to say is this: is this a code addiction? Probably, but <i>that's not why the projects are stalling</i>. The projects are stalling because my Master's degree and interest in physics have become more important. Computer programming has only a second-order effect on the brain; the first-order effect is <i>distractions</i>. We should not write articles on the problems of being addicted to computer programming, the time I spent programming yesterday, while substantial, is about as long as I've spent <i>typing this comment</i> today. This comment (or other distractions which might replace it, TV or comparative religion podcasts or whatever) is more of the problem than the programming.<p>I wish the things that competed for my attention had a simple ordering relation.",1369907986

I'm not going to get paid $120k a year, unless my being there is generating $130k, or $140k, or more for the company.  They're not hiring me to lose money.  This is obvious.<p>As to your theoretical example of starting a company, here is where that falls apart logically.  Several hundred families own trillions in capital.  They make 20% a year profit on each engineer they employ.  Say I own $50 million.  I am a nice guy, so I only make 15% a year profit off each engineer, and give the engineers the other 5%.<p>Several things arise from this.  For one, the dozens of people I employ are only a drop in the bucket to everyone else.  So the dent in the whole economy is negligible.  More importantly, my already relatively small pile of money is growing slower than everyone else's.  Compound returns and all that.  Now they get even more economies of scale.  I can't even maintain my small niche, my small piece of the economy becomes ever smaller over time.<p>I don't want to go into every detail of your messages...anti-competitive?

Musk began by hiring Martin Eberhard as CEO and a management team and provided almost all of the capital for Tesla's first two funding rounds, giving him a controlling interest from the start. As a result of the financial crisis in 2008 and a forced layoff at Tesla,[28] Musk was forced to assume the additional responsibility of CEO.<p>Wikipedia also states Tesla was founded 2003.<p>In 2003, two independent teams, consisting of Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning and Ian Wright on the one hand, and Musk and JB Straubel on the other, both sought to commercialize the T-Zero prototype electric sports car created by AC Propulsion.<p>Tom Gage, the president of AC Propulsion, suggested that the two teams join forces to maximize the chances of success. They agreed to merge their efforts, with Musk becoming chairman and overall head of product design, Eberhard becoming CEO and Straubel becoming CTO.<p>-

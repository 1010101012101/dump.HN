And I'm guessing that it's very hard to find an additional contributory/necessary cause that, when combined with light, would reliably predict the behavior.<p>So they use probability to communicate their findings.<p>If that additional contributory/necessary cause exists (but is just really hard to discover, or perhaps light itself is just highly contributory but not necessary/sufficient) then the probability is an effective way to communicate degree-of-belief, and helps to combine information about what they know with what they don't know.  In other words, they are using probability to communicate partial findings.<p>If that additional contributory/necessary cause doesn't exist, then the probability is a fixed, physical part of the science.  In other words, they're communicating full findings; that light actually creates probability of an effect.<p>And that confusion about ""probability"" is making people believe that the second case is true when they haven't necessarily disproved the first case yet?

It is disruptive, perhaps too disruptive. It commoditizes things which used to be hard to do, even replicating something like Skype or Google Hangouts becomes much easier for small startups, and it scares big IHVs and ISVs who sell equipment and charge money for these services. It threatens to turn phone carriers into bit-pipes as well.<p>Putting on my tin-foil hat, it doesn't seem surprising to me that Microsoft (which owns Skype), Cisco (which owns WebEx), and Nokia (puppet of Microsoft), are pushing back and finding ways to delay it. The brouhaha over the VP8 codec is only one aspect, there are players who are worried their existing deployed VoIP/Video HW endpoints will be obsolete legacy equipment in the new WebRTC world, and so they do not want mandatory features which put them at a disadvantage.<p>But this technology is too important to be designed in a way that makes it hard to use, hitched to commercial legacy hardware, or encumbered by commercially controlled cartels like MPEG-LA.<p></QUOTE>",1364519092

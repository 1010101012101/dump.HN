To make this statement any more meaningful we&#x27;d need quality quantifications; this is an empirical question that a firm or someone with access can answer.<p>But modelling long into a market&#x27;s future in a way that is more accurate than other models, and with appreciable effect size, is probably way harder than short-term predictions. We should expect any approximate model to drift over time.<p>So if you have confidence in short-term modelling, then of course you&#x27;re going to engage in behavior that is profitable to you in the short-term, even if that causes detriment to the company in the long-term. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s enough long-term investor money to counterbalance short-term investors money. But this is an empirical question, and we need quantifications to advance the conversation.",1448571572

Everything else is dead, Jim. Noone is investing enough money and brain power in the other architectures. Only a few people actually know about the rest of the ecosystem (mips, power8...), and noone gives a shit anyway.<p>Keeping an obsolete platform alive is fun because this reminds you of the &#x27;90s, when there was a large choice of hardware platforms, with roughly similar cost/power rations. Eventually, the cheap PC killed almost all competition, and the smartphone market gave ARM an unhealthy market share in the embedded systems world.<p>Then, after a while, it&#x27;s not fun anymore, because noone is writing code with your platform in mind, because it&#x27;s not deemed powerful enough, because modern compilers no longer support your platform (or they produce broken code for it, which is even worse). Does your platform have a hardware limit of a few hundred MB of physical memory? You won&#x27;t be able to run a web browser or even a PDF viewer on it. Does someone still run today&#x27;s gcc&#x27;s testsuite on your platform? No? Sorry dude, here&#x27;s a nickel...<p>Keeping a platform alive is a real team work. This requires a serious commitment from all the ``building block&#x27;&#x27; projects: a not-too-bug-ridden toolchain (as/ld/gcc), as well as support in the flagship projects (emacs, python, X11, mozilla, libreoffice...), and accurate, up-to-date documentation available free of charge.<p>None of this is true of platforms, except for amd64, armv7 and aarch64.<p>Because of this, trying to keep a platform alive is really going against the tide.<p>Have a look at all free operating system projects: they really only support amd64, armv7 and aarch64. Gee! Sometimes they pretend to support a few other experimental platforms. Or other platforms which have not been tested in years and are only cross-built because they are not self-hosting anymore.<p>Of course, you&#x27;ll still find a few looneys which will do an incredible amount of work to prevent the decay of their platform of choice, and give the impression that these platforms are still first class citizens. But these guys are the same as ten years ago. And eventually, they get tired and give up. Just like me.<p>The worst part in this, is to look back and realize that, after all those years, free software has lost. Companies working on non-free software have been smart enough to get the momentum of the free software developers to work on embedded platforms in order to tremendously shrink they software engineering costs, yet getting positive press.<p>So, today, we&#x27;re building disposable systems, without any consideration to future products, because when the time will come, we&#x27;ll pick the next trendy SoC. No need to have what makes an architecture: a vision towards the future allowing different hardware generations to share hardware and software; a design allowing today&#x27;s software to be able to run on tomorrow&#x27;s hardware as long as the changes are not too drastic; consistency in choices of busses, key chips, address maps; a real firmware, not something utterly disgusting as EFI which can&#x27;t even compete with > 20 years old Open Firmware (IEEE 1275); and reliably enumerable busses. No, sir, we&#x27;ll take today&#x27;s latest SoC, wire a few extra devices wherever we can find some hole in the address map, put a castrated u-boot on it, and today&#x27;s stable Linux tree, and here you go, here&#x27;s your ``platform&#x27;&#x27;. And people cheer.<p>I&#x27;ve spent 20 years in my life trying to promote a certain view of free software, its values and its ethic, fighting for it, getting involved, trying to lead by example, and on this day, I get the feeling that all I did was wasting my time and that nothing I did has been useful.<p>It&#x27;s a hard pill to swallow.<p>Better resign now than keep trying and only get bitterer in the process.",1448571432

The old version of the kernel they originally applied to no longer compiles without a number of changes.  Automake doesn&#x27;t work with the old makefiles anymore.  So if you type make, you have to rewrite the makefile.  Then if you do that, they still don&#x27;t compile because of behavior changes in gcc.  Some of these are the fault of the kernel developers making bad decisions, like including both -Wall and -Werror in their flags which cases compilation to fail with newer compilers when new warnings are introduced.  (Compilers are always allowed to add warnings later, and indeed they do.)  Along with a few other things that fail.<p>Since I didn&#x27;t want to develop on a years old kernel anyway, I forward ported Sun&#x27;s old patches to a newer version of the kernel and successfully moved the newest kernel code available for the platform forward a few years.  But was never able to get the latest kernels working, because the newest kernels all fail on that platform during initialization.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s something I could fix if I needed to, but tracking down why a kernel crashes on an entire platform before it starts init is just no fun.<p>Maybe someone else fixed that bug and pushed it forward again, but as far as I know the current status of running Linux on an FPGA with the OpenSPARC T1 core is that the latest kernel available is 3.9 from my tree on github.

I&#x27;d like to take a look.<p>The high-protein diet fads are not new. You can find a lot of information discrediting their authors and methodology. Here is just one example,<p>> There are two kinds of high-protein diets popular today: Those that limit calorie intake by causing the body to develop a metabolic state known as ketosis; and those that make stringent rules which limit the dieter’s intake of food.<p>> The “ketogenic diets” cause the body to produce ketones by severe restriction of carbohydrate intake while allowing unlimited fat and protein intake. With insufficient intake of the body’s primary fuel, carbohydrate, the body turns to fats from foods and from body fat for fuel. Byproducts of this metabolism are acidic substances called ketones (acetacetic acid, B-hydroxybuteric acid, and acetone). The metabolic condition is known as ketosis. Ketosis is associated with loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, and hypotension (lower blood pressure). The result is a decrease in food (calorie) intake. Ketosis is the key to the diet’s success, by allowing the body to starve while reducing the suffering of severe hunger pangs.<p>> This same condition, ketosis, occurs naturally when people are literally starving to death or seriously ill. During starvation this metabolic state is a kindness of nature allowing the victim to suffer much reduced pains of hunger while dying. During illness the suppression of the appetite frees the person to rest and recuperate, rather then be forced by hunger to gather and prepare food. Because ketogenic diets simulate this metabolic state seen with serious illness, I refer to them as “the make yourself sick diets.” As we will see below, another reason low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets deserve this title is they contain significant amounts of the very foods — the meats — that the American Cancer Society and the Heart Association tell us contribute to our most common causes of death and disability.<p><a href=""https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/health-science/featured-articles/articles/high-protein-diets/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/health-science/...</a>",1448570450

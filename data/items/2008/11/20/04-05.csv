If they fire all the executives at those companies as he suggests, will Bain Consulting make a lot of money guiding the automakers through a restructuring? I don't want to sound conspiratorial but it is convenient that he's publically expressing opinions like this while closely tied to a company that does business consulting.",1227157173

370330,comment,369932,369932,0,0,hooande,,,"The biggest problem with the detroit automakers is their high pension and medical cost burden. People are living far longer now than they were predicted to when the pension deals were struck in 1951. The Detroit automakers have an unbearable burden when compared to foreign car makers. This drives up their prices and effects all of the business decisions that they make.<p>The management at the big three auto companies hasn't been very brilliant or innovative, but I bet they've done just about as well as the management teams at comparably sized companies. Firing all of them would probably just cause a lot of chaos and waste decades of learning and experience.<p>This financial problems they are facing have more to do with the credit crisis than making the wrong kind of cars. There is this insinuation in that media that if Ford had just made more eco-friendly cars then everything would be ok. There is still plenty of demand for american cars and trucks (especially in the american south). It seems like they just need some time and money to re-negotiate things with the unions and this can be worked out.",1227156642

Most sites today are so terrible that a user is forced to run a near endless gauntlet of trials and tribulations before they meet anyone remotely suitable.  This leads to a scarcity mentality which many people react to by 'latching on' to the first acceptable person.  As a corollary, many people think that online daters are only in it to search for 'the right one.'<p>But in reality, most online daters would in fact like to meet ""the reasonable 10"" and have some options to choose from.  That was our thinking behind <a href=""http://flowmingle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flowmingle.com</a> .  We wanted to lower the cost of finding a reasonable person and setting up a date, and make going on a date a likely and regular event.<p>In this way, yes, your customers eventually leave, but in the meantime they have had a good experience and will come back if they need to.  The supply of single people is endless and lucrative for an effective site that treats their customers well.",1227154878
370314,comment,369932,370229,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, a very high % of taxes come from either businesses or people who make more than the average GM worker. Plus a $25 billion dollar loan to GM isn't the same thing, from the taxpayers perspective, as giving them $25 billion. Presumably it will be paid back with interest. Of course, it won't get as much interest as people could earn investing their own money in the private sector, or they'd all be buying GM bonds already, but the actual loss is orders of magnitude less than $25 billion.<p>I don't think there's a lot of moral hazard there in terms of taking from the poor and giving to GM workers. The real issue is whether it's better for everyone involved than just allowing them to restructure in bankruptcy. I can't see how the answer to that could be yes.",1227154853

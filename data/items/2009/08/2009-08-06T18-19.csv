Alternatively, Apple fail to conduct said search, pass the app, and someone's rosy cheeked darling is caught scanning naughty words on their iPhone. Consumer advocacy groups and parental groups set the blogosphere alight with vitriol and damns Apple to hell. The honeymoon for Apple is over. They fought, they gained market and mindshare, and now they find themselves in a position where their former fans wish to slay them, and they're high profile enough to piss off the non-techs who buy their tech.

Moreover, with the latter problem, he'll get virtually no feedback as to whether his answer was correct, because a correct answer for ""use statistics to predict stock prices"" doesn't exist.

1.  People in different social classes have different inherent desires in life.  Some people simply want a family and have no other ambitions.
2.  Lower class people (or people that have more children on average) have a harder time delaying gratification on average.  Delaying gratification is a skill very beneficial when attempting to be successful and is related to the ability to think ahead and visualize the future.

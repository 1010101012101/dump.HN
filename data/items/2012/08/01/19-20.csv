It varies industry-to-industry, but governments have long recognized that you get many of the monopoly powers before you reach 100%.  This is even more true when there are network effects.<p>Standard Oil only had 64% market share when it was broken up.<p>Edit (since I can't reply): We aren't expecting a FB breakup for the same reason we don't expect a CL breakup; the US Justice department has been taking a hands-off approach.  Given their expertise and the possibility of doing damage, that might be the right approach, but that <i>doesn't</i> mean the monopolies don't exists and aren't doing damage.  (Remember, I'm not arguing for a CL breakup, just for the fact that the monopoly exists and must be discussed.)  Frankly, I would support a FB breakup, especially if it could lead to an open social-media protocol for federations.<p>There are plenty of CL competitors.

The technology is out there, it's just a matter of patching it all together.<p>Here is a concept image I drew up in Paint just now: http://i.imgur.com/yEDT2.png<p>Here are my implementation thoughts:<p>+ Use http://codemirror.net/ for the actual in-browser editor<p>+ Use git for project file syncing, on the server, similar to Cloud9<p>+ HTTP-based API for fetching and updating files from a client browser<p>+ Compile on the server using Xcode command line tools, similar to how http://travis-ci.org/ operates<p>+ Actual iPhone emulator, using the technology, or similar technology, that powers https://browserling.com/ so you could get full click interaction<p>I know I entirely over simplified this. The only parts that I do not know if they'd work or not would be the actual compiling of the Objective-C code and the VNC-like emulator idea. I don't know if Substack has open sourced the core technology that powers browserling or not (I would assume probably not).  Also, not sure if it would run on OSX either. There's probably ways to simplify this, too. Like, I have not poked around at the command line parameters to the iPhone emulator, etc, so I don't know if you can even invoke it from a command prompt, or if you have to go through Xcode.<p>This would require a lot of server power, but I think it'd be pretty sweet.",1343851084

If padmapper remained small, then they probably scrape more posts than they have unique views. Of the 100 they scrape, maybe only 10 are seen. As padmapper et al grow, it may reduce the bandwidth on cl.<p>In 10 years, if all clients looking for apartments use a plug-in however, now you have cl paying for a lot more bandwidth than outsourcing this functionality to a centralized service, because for every 100 posts they scrape, they may only really look at one and they want the ability to show thousands on a single map.<p>I really don't understand why cl doesn't just do it themselves. It's not hard.

You should not just start working on being a better UI designer without knowing what context your work will exist in. Specialize in UI later.<p>A quick overview on how to be a better UX designer\n- Figure out and write down in minimum words the goals and reasons for undertaking the exercise<p>- Figure out the main types of users you are designing for (don't try to design for everyone). Find out what relevant mental model they already have.<p>- Break down the problem via concept maps (involve others to brainstorm).<p>- Sketch several solution hypothesis using flow diagrams (boxes containing major concepts connected to each other) (involve others to brainstorm).<p>- Compare these flow diagrams and identify the best hypothesis to develop and test first. (Failure is okay)<p>- Now do UI design for each aspect of the selected flow diagram (as you will know how each page/area in the flow diagram works with the entire picture, you'll know what to show the user when.)<p>- Do not try to complicate your test by adding features/distractions that are not extremely crucial.<p>- Put in some love and care. Ideas that spawned from your brain have the possibility of giving so many others so much joy.<p>(Hint* For a lot of products it is about making MOST users get engaged for the LONGEST period. For many others it is about solving a user problem in the Simplest+Quickest+Most-Painless+Most-Joyful way possible.)<p>A bit more on how to be a better UI designer<p>- Go back to the basics and learn how humans sense, how the brain perceives, and what makes us get ideas, form opinions and take action. This is a big part of what UX and UI design is about (this is useful to understand and remember too - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Properties"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Properties</a>)<p>- It is also about having a two way conversation between an interface and a human. Follow protocols of a decent and efficient conversation. Empathize. Introduce if you haven't met before. Maintain a flow. Be focussed on the goal. Don't distract and value their time. Be terse. Don't disrespect.<p>- Know that content is always more important than the user interface. Strive for harmony between what you have to say with how you are saying it with the best UI for that purpose). Use the help of a copy editor or a technical writer. Ensure they don't write more than is needed.<p>- Learn about the medium and context you are designing for (e.g. how users use computers, web etc)<p>- Learn about the existing UI patterns that you can leverage<p>- Browse a lot. Note down what you like, store it as a pattern in your head. Note what irritates you and think about how it could be done better for more users.<p>- Practice. A Lot.<p>- Get hold of a good designer and sit next to them. See them work. See how they make their life faster and easier while designing. Optimize your workspace continuously. Look out for new tools that can help your workflow.<p>- Generating consensus around the flow and UI solution is your job. Get the stakeholders to see the way you think.<p>-Don't use Colors initially, they derail conversations quickly as humans are prone to judging colors instinctively. Use grayscale and rough way of doing stuff first. Finalize (visual design) after that.<p>- Ensure that the colors did not change the flow of user's attention on a page.<p>-Figure out if the flow of user's attention on a page is the way you intend<p>- Grab five people, give then some basic context and do RITE (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RITE_Method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RITE_Method</a> ). Don't listen to all feedback. Designers usually give feedback based on heuristics. Try to get more designers to give you feedback.<p>- Use web based tools as often as you can. It is easy to share your work and get feedback quickly. There are tools for getting feedback online. But have a meeting at least once initially to explain the context and thinking behind your design decisions.",1343849020

Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.<p>Academia.edu has over 1.5 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.<p>We need talented engineers to help us accelerate the world's research. We believe that science is currently dysfunctional, and that there is a chance to make a big impact.<p>We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812</a>.

4325006,comment,4322767,4324794,9,0,gecko,,,"I'm a <i>heavy</i> Emacs user, and I don't agree with that statement.<p>I can see three places you might be coming from and feel that way: you use Eshell; you use ansi-term mode with e.g. bash; or you simply barely ever hit shell, instead using things like dired-interactive to accomplish shell-like tasks.<p>The last, to me, is a nonstarter.  You can do many, many things using native Emacs tools, but not all.  dired is not the right tool for quickly making a pile of nested directories and moving files into them based on file size, there is no Emacs take on top, etc.  You can come back and say, ""Fine, write some elisp for that,"" but to me, that's like saying you don't need to learn PowerShell because you have Explorer and VBScript.  Just because there's overlapping functionality doesn't mean that one tool can substitute for the other.<p>If you were thinking ansi-term, then learning the nuances of zsh (or fish or whatever) is still helpful.  ansi-term, at most, frees you from memorizing keystrokes.  Past that, you're still very much using whatever shell you're invoking.  I'd want to learn zsh just as much, or as little, running in ansi-term as in Emacs.<p>That just leaves Eshell.  I like Eshell fine, but there are hard limits on what you can do with it <i>as a shell</i>, because it's not really a shell as much as an interactive elisp REPL with an alternative default syntax.  Job management and piping are bizarre, you're still thrown into ansi-term for interactive tools (and yes, there are some tools I would prefer to use interactively), even non-interactive stuff sometimes displays incorrectly or bizarrely due to Eshell not really being a term, and so on.  So while you can use Eshell <i>most</i> of the time, it's not a complete replacement for a real shell.<p>Now, is it possible that Emacs tools like dired/VCS integration/etc., combined with Eshell, means you can use a ""real"" shell less if you want to?  Yeah, sure--just like I can use folder actions and AppleScript on my desktop to replace some of my old cron jobs with on-demand drag-and-drop processing.  But to say that learning zsh wouldn't be rewarding if I knew Emacs just strikes me as weird.",1343848546
4325005,comment,4322371,4323164,3,0,drostie,,,"I don't write <i>for atheists</i> per se, I write for everyone. However, <i>as an atheist</i>, I won't inject supernaturalism into the religion: therefore, the religion mixes effortlessly with whatever supernatural predispositions you already have or lack. In that sense I suppose it can be called ""meta-religious"". When I speak to myself I sometimes classify it as ""a material dharma"" -- but ""dharma"" is religious jargon from India and won't make so much sense if I don't explain its etymology and its meanings in those religions. (A passable definition is ""essence"", used idiomatically. So you have to ask, ""the essence <i>of what?</i>"")<p>When we talk about authentic, virtuous living, the commitments we make, how we work together, how we conceptualize the world, and how we find meaning therein, then the supernatural might teach or inspire these things, but we should not mistake the supernatural as identical with these things.<p>So, you might say for example, ""the Light shines from God."" I am not going to speak about God, but about the Light, which is its own thing; and I remain non-committal about its origins. (Too much blood has been shed historically because ""They don't believe in Our Gods."") Or you might say for example ""the True Reward from the Light is reaped in the afterlife."" Again, that's fine by me, as long as you acknowledge that, in this life, the Light is its own reward -- authentic living is worth it for its own sake.<p>Thus we head into a future where theism and atheism are as one and enlightenment depends upon the character one cultivates, not the doctrines one professes.<p>(Edit: I want to add that the real paradox in that sentence is self-contained in the subsentence, ""I'm writing a religion."")",1343848539

4324916,comment,4319276,4322498,1,0,bobwaycott,,,"This is actually quite a projection on your end. Saying ""God"" != ""something is just what it is, and we can't really say why."" It is typically, from an investigatory and cultural-historical standpoint, a curiosity-stopper, not an explanation (or even a signifier of an explanation). It is equivalent to stating ""magic"" (ignoring for just this moment the generational and historical bit offered as explanation for the term's usage).<p>Including references to ""God"" in an attempted explanation of quantum mechanics is not ""easily understandable"". Moreover, it's rootedness in culture brings with it myriad histories that impact the way a reader understands what a writer intends. Explaining quantum mechanics by anthropomorphising a God-construct who ""chose"" to make something one way versus some other way is distracting to readers who do not inject God-construct into their own explanations specifically to avoid making understanding more difficult on the reader.<p>I can accept that this is a practice from the author's field and generation and <i>still find it distracting and unhelpful</i> without that equating to me being ""that much biased."" <i>God</i> does not elicit a mentally neutral concept that compresses ""a pack of thoughts and emotions in just a few words"" when discussing quantum mechanics. It would still be better for the author to not use ""God"", insofar as it eliminates mysterious language from his explanation, thus reducing the overhead of his reader needing to substitute a non-loaded term (especially when dealing with the sciences, where injecting the term ""God"" has a history rooted in Western culture of not being too helpful and enlightening).<p>I can accept it being a practice among the community. That, however, does not imply it is an easily understood, necessary, or sufficient shorthand.",1343847743

Until i reaches the length of the collection foo, do the following, then increment i and repeat: call the function bar with the element of foo at position i. If bar returns true, append the element to baz.

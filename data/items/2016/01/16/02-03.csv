I&#x27;ve seen this myself: you don&#x27;t have to grow up rich or even upper middle class to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders grew up desperately poor. But again, the problem here is not simply economic inequality. There is an enormous difference in wealth between the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successful startup founder, but that didn&#x27;t prevent him from joining their ranks. It&#x27;s not economic inequality per se that&#x27;s blocking social mobility, but some specific combination of things that go wrong when kids grow up sufficiently poor.&quot; (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html</a>)",1452913170

I forget about these things since I&#x27;m not American.<p>> First, it&#x27;s not just &quot;simply&quot; population growth. Try ferrying 27 million immigrants to current Southern Europe and see how the GDP fares.<p>A certain economic development model says growth is a function of technology, labour, and capital utilization.  Assuming there&#x27;s excess capital available, more population growth will always lead to economic growth.  Whether or not you actually believe the model doesn&#x27;t matter, economic growth has generally followed population growth, according to data.<p>> What you&#x27;re essentially saying is that if a country has ten people earning $100 each, and then ten more people who were earning $2 in other countries now join the first ten (whose income is unaltered) but earn only $5, the quality of life has been reduced.<p>That&#x27;s essentially what slavery was...<p>> To me this is simply nonsense unless one doesn&#x27;t care about the quality of life of immigrants.<p>This is a different discussion altogether.  We can see today, in places like Saudi Arabia, migrant workers come and are unable to attain anywhere close to a living standard the Saudis enjoy, is that the model we want?<p>Also, the US can&#x27;t take in 6+ billion immigrants.  Nice thought, but not possible.<p>And finally, I&#x27;m well aware of the plight of immigrants and those in 3rd world countries - my wife is an immigrant from a 3rd world country.  However, when you factor in the cost of living, it&#x27;s not always an upgrade (in my wife&#x27;s case, she&#x27;s done well so it is, but many of her family are in worse condition in Canada than back home)...",1452912934

10913991,comment,10912225,10912780,0,0,exclusiv,,,"VRBO and HomeAway tend to be better for higher-end properties. People that spend a lot of money want to talk to the owners prior to booking and VRBO/HomeAway facilitates that. People that own high end properties want to talk to the renters too. They also have custom rental agreements baked in to the booking process. I rent a 6BR and everyone wants to get a better deal. That&#x27;s part of the dance. I tend to favor last minute / higher yield since I have a solid product and an automated home.<p>AirBnB prevents pre-booking contact because their model is different. They make money on bookings, mostly from the consumer. For HomeAway I pay them ~$1600/yr and get featured placement and no booking fees. That is actually a small marketing expense for my property so the consumer can actually pay quite a bit less by booking my property on VRBO instead of AirBnB which charges the consumer 6-12%.<p>AirBnB has the problem of being seen as the platform for renting shared space. I think they will do a good job branding as a place for entire home rentals but that may take some time with the older crowd. They have a good renter review system which doesn&#x27;t exist on VRBO. They are prioritizing hosts that respond quickly because they know that in order to take real share from hotels/resorts and HomeAway/VRBO they will need to provide a better booking experience and also excel at last minute bookings. HA/VRBO doesn&#x27;t have a lot of checks in place to ensure the consumer receives adequate service and this is mostly due to their chosen business model.<p>I don&#x27;t know how this will shake out in full but as an owner, you should be on both. Expedia bought HomeAway so I think that is huge for them because they could launch a really compelling reward platform and provide owners more distribution. I would bet AirBnB would get scooped up by someone as well or finance a strategic acquisition of their own.<p>Once business travel falls to AirBnb/HA/VRBO due to incentivized rewards programs, hotels will be extremely scared, esp since most are franchises who are losing power. This hasn&#x27;t happened yet. They&#x27;re telling the story that AirBnB/VRBO has simply provided more room-nights that wouldn&#x27;t have happened without them but I don&#x27;t buy it.<p>Regardless, there is plenty of space for two heavyweights and I&#x27;m bullish on both.",1452912553

For file I/O there is no non-blocking I/O option, so the whole OS-thread might block on it along with all the fibers that it owns. Therefore any operation that is not socket I/O and goes beyond CPU and RAM should be delegated from fibers to a good old worker thread pool. The fiber should yield after submitting a request to the pool, and on the request completion the worker thread should notify the fiber scheduler to resume the original fiber.",1452910797

Then there are random and difficult to reproduce issues where containers with bridged networking simply stop passing traffic from external interfaces into the containers when nothing has changed etc. So we use docker containers for some things, but try to limit them due to docker simply not being amazing for running production services for some of our use cases.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/13885"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/13885</a>",1452910609

My wife is in health care (Physical Therapy) and makes 80k+ which is a bit higher than my own salary, but that&#x27;s it.  No benefits (such as stock, etc), and no chance of higher pay.  80k is about it (she&#x27;s a clinic director with a large company).  I can get half again her salary by commuting 1+ hour a day instead of my 20 minute commute, but she doesn&#x27;t have that option.  The pay in Seattle is pretty much the pay in Tacoma. In fact, she works outside of Tacoma in a small town, so her pay is actually higher than in Seattle, where in web development, that&#x27;s not the case.  Tacoma hires &quot;ninja javascript developers&quot; as low as 35k (according to listings in craigslist that I&#x27;ve seen, and in fact, my first job out of college in the immediate Tacoma area - Gig Harbor - started at 15/hr with a &quot;promise&quot; of 20/hr after 90 days; which turned into 17/hr)<p>So, I don&#x27;t disagree with your points, but nurses and PTs have a lower ceiling than software engineers.  By far.",1452909668

They wanted to drop it before then, but the publishers in order to promote an alternative to iTunes made DRM-free music available to Amazon first. Apple dropped it as soon as they were allowed by the publishers. It was written into their contract that DRM was required. Steve Jobs talked about this in his &quot;Thoughts on Music&quot; post. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be on Apple&#x27;s site now (it was written in 2007), but you can read the whole thing at,<p><a href=""http://macdailynews.com/2007/02/06/apple_ceo_steve_jobs_posts_rare_open_letter_thoughts_on_music/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macdailynews.com/2007/02/06/apple_ceo_steve_jobs_post...</a><p>The relevant part is:\n&quot;The third alternative is to abolish DRMs entirely. Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM-free music encoded in open licensable formats. In such a world, any player can play music purchased from any store, and any store can sell music which is playable on all players. This is clearly the best alternative for consumers, and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat. If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM, we would switch to selling only DRM-free music on our iTunes store. Every iPod ever made will play this DRM-free music.&quot;",1452909659

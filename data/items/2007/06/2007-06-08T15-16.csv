I just go to the big warehouse that stocks every item I can possibly think of. <p>On the net, ebay and Amazon come to mind - and not because Amazon is the best vendor in selling Paris Hilton memoirs...",1181317156

I use software RAID 1 for reliability purposes. <p>With new quad core processors coming out from AMD I can see myself using 4x4 (16 cores) box with at least 32GB of RAM with My SQL DB sitting on one of those ""solid state disks"".

I love that you post here, give genuine advice on your blog, and didn't present at startup school with the crazy and rude idea that you were going to find employees for your company, like some of the speakers did.<p>But, I think you should mention the most important rule of optimization--don't optimize something that doesn't even exist yet.  When you create anything new, just do it.  When something bothers you once, twice, three times, then you know what to address.<p>Another example of when optimizing early isn't just a waste of time, but can hurt one in other ways as well, is when optimizing early is going to hide some information from the developer(s) when they need it most.<p>For example, say one has a live stats page.  One can always optimize and cache the stats pages later on when one gets a lot of users and doing so will actually make a difference in performance.  But in the beginning, anything ""live"" should be live so the developers can test things out and get instant feedback, and not see a cached or confusingly optimized result.<p>How I try to think about it, is ""anything that takes time away from creating new things because something that used to work previously is now slow or broken.""  THEN one should optimize.  Anything else is a waste of time.<p>The WORST kind of optimization?  PEOPLE RE-WRITING THEIR ENTIRE SOFTWARE OR WEB APP IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE.",1181315964

Then, when I did become Student Body President at 19 (it was a big two-year school my parents made me attend), everybody else in Student Government said there would be too much apathy in the student body to have a student-run newspaper. Also, students said a chess club wouldn't happen.  Finally, administration said a smoking policy could not happen.  Yet, not only did they happen, but all of those things exist 5 years later, each in even bigger form.  <p>The newspaper is now in color and part of a class.  The chess club is now run by the math advisor who loves doing it and there have been chess boards in his office and the engineering lab for the past 5 years, last I heard.  And, the smoking policy is in the student handbook the exact way I planned it out and wrote it, so students wouldn't have to walk through smoky entrances.<p>Then, people said I couldn't get a congressional nomination to the Naval Academy because it is very difficult to do so.  But I did, twice, and worked my butt off to succeed in the physical aptitude tests, and raised my SAT from 1170 to 1400, and started selling shareware at 20, though I was not appointed by the school itself; but with the cheating and rape scandals at that school over the past few years, I think their student body and alumni must also upset be upset about the disconnect between who they say they want and who they take.  So I just continued to create software since then.<p>Compared to that, one just has to create some kind of a web application that helps people do something.  You don't have to attend meetings, get signatures, drive for hours across the state, run for election, or wait for unions to respond in some cases.  You could have a working prototype in one day.<p>Everybody tries to compare themselves to facebook or youtube or google, and they never realize that each of those was very simple in the beginning and had a purpose since day one.<p>The fact is that ""apathy"" is actually a good thing for those who create.  It means once you do create something, people are going to be reluctant to switch away from it.  So, apathy is actually a benefit to those who create things.<p>The only people who bring up apathy are those who weren't going to create something, anyway.<p>In other words, the people who pretend they are creators but say ""there is no market"" even though such a tool or idea would definitely benefit certain people--those people are not creators, they are talkers.  The creators realize that apathy actually works with them, not against them, since whoever starts using their tool (if it benefits them in any way) will keep using it.<p>On a similar note, if somebody says something can't happen or won't happen, then you know they're just lazy and are reflecting their experiences on you, but not considering your own drive and motivation.  Most everybody who says you can or can't do something, shares experiences based on their own life, that they can't even remember clearly, and in only a 2 minute conversation.<p>Apathy towards change is also why you have to read diverse opinions every day on many different subjects, just to find the few people whose stuff makes sense.<p>Most people write the best stuff before they are famous, and  everything since is just garbage.  So, apathy works to those people's advantage, but not necessarily to others.<p>If you started reading Steve Pavlina today, you would think of him as some kind of a nut job who tries to pimp as many affiliate programs to his readers as possible.  If you learn about Paul Graham today, you will think of him as some rich dot com millionaire-turned-investor making kids work 60 hour weeks during the summer, as well as telling kids to drop out of school so they try to start businesses with his money.  Both of those are true, because at some point, everybody deserves to make money, but if you look back, you can see it's their articles from many years ago that truly defined them, and that's the stuff you want to be reading.<p>This means that you have to not only find the companies and people who are reputable, but figure out WHY they became reputable.  Don't look at facebook or myspace or PG right now; look back at what their options were, and what they did.  That's the only thing that matters.  Otherwise, you're laughing at Jerry Seinfeld or whoever it is because you're used to their delivery style.<p>To famous creators -- comedians, web apps, investors--apathy is great and they deserve it.  But you have to realize it's a good thing that exists, not a bad thing.  Otherwise, you wouldn't have any benefits either, as people would jump from your web app to another, or a comedian would be forgotten if he didn't do standup for one month.<p>YOU want to be the most agile developer ever, always helping people the fastest way you can, always researching the best ways to help people.  But most users will stay with a tool that already helps them--so move on to something else.  <p>So, don't hate apathy, and ignore those who bring it up as an excuse to avoid creating something.  YES, apathy exists, but it benefits those who create, not those who think.<p>So, the next time somebody wants to create a Magazine, people will say, we already have a newspaper.  Don't bother trying, because the school will never sponsor both.  Let's create a Risk Club. No way, they already sponsor Chess, so let's not bother trying.<p>That's right, people will whine about the current state of affairs without realizing it's up to them to continue the improvement along, and without making an attempt themselves.  That means that apathy carries your current creations way beyond any date you can imagine.  The harder it is to start something, the longer it will fly, it seems.  So, the more ""apathy"" there is towards helping people do a certain thing, the more likely whatever you create will fly longer.  It will be weird to come back in 20 years and hear that those three things either exist in the same form or are even greater.<p>Plus, remember--even though you proved those people wrong, you are now in a different place, while the nay-sayers who are afraid to try to make a difference are still there.  Therefore, they are slowing down whoever else is now there trying to make a change, therefore increasing the length of time your ideas continue to exist.<p>Therefore, apathy is NOT a deterrent to success, only YOU are.  Because whether people TALK agreement or TALK disagreement, only YOU can make the change and do it.  Whether or not somebody likes your idea or not, you're the one who has to create it, so you're the only criteria in whether it happens or not.",1181314991

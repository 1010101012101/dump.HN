Funding a team will often mean funding people with experience, or some other factor that lets the VC know that this is the right horse to back.<p>Lots of engineers get funded, but they don't get funded for 'projects that languish in notebooks due to lack of capital'.<p>So that's the problem first. You need to be able to sell your idea, and likely you should probably be on the road to building it or have something built before looking for funding.<p>Pick up Curtis Carlson's book ""Innovation: the Five Disciples to Creating What Customers Want"". \nIt will help you put together the proper positioning for your idea and get it ready to be heard.<p>----- EDITED -----\nI REALLY liked Sama's response (which wasn't there when I wrote my original response above).<p>My response is probably focused on steps. You can't go right from idea to VC (unless you have some serious connections and likely some very serious successes in your past as well).<p>An idea is just an idea. It is a management team (which <i>might</i> need a good engineer) which brings the whole thing together.<p>Rarely (though it does happen) is an engineer the best person to lead a business. Think Apple - Woz was the engineer, Jobs the manager/marketer. \nYou might need to find your Jobs if you're Woz (okay, that's not the way the history works, but you get the jist).<p>By the way, I'm in your boat (kinda) I'm the engineer of my start-up and also trying to be the management guy.

Also locks have well understood performance characteristics, unlike TM's which generally rely on a complex and not-well-understood runtime portion (and indeed all the STMs out there have wildly varying ""sweet spots"" such that code which performs well on one STM might be really unusably slow on another STM).""<p>Transactional memory sounds appealing to programmers who've worked hard on making lock-based systems scale because the grass is always greener. Locks sound easy, too, until you try to build a huge system with them. It sounds like Azul has built the first industrial scale TM implementation, and done it with some of the best and brightest, but has not found the going significantly easier or faster than with traditional methods.",1237665453

It's brand new and it's true the docs need some improvements. .NET has three ORMs built in (L2S, EF and typed Datasets, which are crap, but they're there) that you can use for the model. Validation and scaffolding are there (not sure how they missed that) and there's excellent 3rd party validation tools (like xVal).

They cost around $3-4 per cubic inch, and one method of reducing cost is to create hollow volumes instead of solid ones. But then they're reduced to visual study models, rather than any potentially functional ones.<p>I'm interested in seeing how the print materials will evolve. Current materials are great for prototyping and generating forms, but materials like starch are very brittle, and anything less than .125"" thick will usually break. It would be great to print models that are not only functional and durable, but viable as end products.<p>A lot of attention is on 3D printing, but that's connected to a larger set of technologies that make up ""digital fabrication,"" which includes laser-cutting and stereolithography, etc. Laser-cutting is as significant as 3D printing, I think, as you can design interesting 2D patterns as well as folded surfaces, that can be aesthetic or even structural.<p>For one of my projects this semester, I created a nice set of computer speakers for my macbook, out of foamcore(!). I lasercut the foam to create the housing for the speakers, and encase the circuit board that had the power and volume controls. The next step is to buy higher-end speakers and create the housing out of high-grade wood for better acoustics.<p>Anyway, the point is, you can make a lot of interesting things with digital fabrication.. I don't think it'll be as ubiquitous as inkjet printing, but more similar to the structure of Software Development Kits, where industrial designers will facilitate co-creating your customized products. I can imagine separate teams of designers making customized laptop chassis, medical equipment, cell phones, etc...",1237663535
526455,comment,525912,526396,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"A nice data point.  Though, the critical thinker will immediately notice that the article discusses foreclosures, and not foreclosures on CRA loans.  Indeed, a little research will confirm that most of the places you listed, do not qualify for CRA.  For instance, Lehigh Acres (Ft. Meyers FL), often described as ground zero of the mortgage crisis would have in no way qualified for CRA loans.  Contrast that with the North and South Carolinas.  Both states have huge, impoverished, minority communities.  Both states have communities that make liberal use of CRA.  Odd, is it not, that these states should be so relatively void of foreclosures.<p>An interesting exercise I am trying to engage in is to determine, what percentage of CRA loans were defaulted on in comparison to Fannie and Freddie loans.  It is difficult to determine as right now Fannie and Freddie seem almost desperate to keep that information opaque.  Why?<p>What I can say is that here is a telling datapoint, Fannie and Freddy have collapsed, but Ginnie is still going strong.  What problems Ginnie has, it got through foolhardy government attempts to save Fannie and Freddy.  ""What is Ginnie?"", you ask.  Ginnie Mae is the explicitly government backed entity that handles all of the FHA HUD housing stuff, indian (native American) housing, housing for military veterans etc.  Incidentally, FHA HUD housing provides loans explicitly to those with low credit scores and low incomes.  Strange, don't you think, that they are not having trouble right now?  I mean given that these are exactly the people who are alleged to have caused the problem.  Even more curious that Fannie and Freddy would collapse, considering Ginnie was the one on the hook for all of these low credit score mortgages.<p>Again, as always, I know there are a lot of people shooting off their mouths right now, so I invite you to look these things up.  You may find it helpful to start here <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_National_Mortgage_Association"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_National_Mortgage_As...</a>.  Then there is an explication of exactly what CRA does here <a href=""http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ffiec.gov/cra/</a>.  And finally, you may think wikipedia is biased, so I would encourage you to read more about Ginnie Mae here <a href=""http://ginniemae.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ginniemae.gov</a>.  Finally, take a look at the map on the link you sent out in your post <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2009-03-05-foreclosure_N.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2009-03-05-for...</a> and compare the North and South Carolinas to say California.<p>Now you are probably asking why you've never heard of this stuff before?  Because data, takes analysis and critical thought.  It doesn't fit well in a soundbite.  Seneca said that a lie could make it halfway around the world before a fact could get its shoes on.

1024089,comment,1022944,1023219,0,0,ashley,,,"I'm more familiar with St. John's College, as I dreamed of attending had not the cost been so prohibitively high.\n<a href=""http://www.sjca.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sjca.edu/</a><p>But the one-track curriculum is based off the trivium and quadrivium of medieval education, where you don't have electives but regardless, you get a well-rounded education because they're preparing you to think and inquire.  So every student studies Greek, Latin, French, Western classical music, mathematics from the source (like Euclid's Elements and Newton's Principia), physics from the source, chemistry, history, etc.  No modern textbooks rehashing information, so theoretically, no passive learning.  So this curriculum isn't really a straitjacket.<p>The one downside is that you're not getting a very multicultural or contemporary view, given that you're reading the Western canon largely pre-World War II.  But it's not such a big problem if you again realize that the idea with this education is that you're being trained not in subjects but in the ability to go out and find what you don't know in the classroom on your own and to discuss these new ideas with other people.",1262253146

It's unfortunate that a lot of abuses have gone unpunished and that more people (and companies) are taking these bad examples as 'the way to do it' because everybody else is doing it too.<p>This is not a purely American thing, though I would definitely contend that the United States has seen some of the worst excesses of this.",1262252808
1024084,comment,1023656,1023703,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I'm not a Microsoft hater at all and contrary to some others I think they have been an innovative company (e.g. VB, XMLHTTPRequest, Linq, ...). But Wilcox's list of ""visionary"" Microsoft innovation is weird.<p>I mean just because they did something before Apple did it doesn't mean they invented it, nor that they were particularly visionary. Most of the items on that list were talking points at the time and many wanted to do them in the .com bubble years. What Microsoft was talking about then was just part of the general ""vision hyper-inflation"" of the time.<p>Hailstorm was a concept for an XML Web Services platform. Yes it was supposed to support API access to things like address books among many other things, but presenting this as the predecessor to Facebook is a stretch to say the least. Facebook started out as a web site, not as a platform. Turning that on its head is not visionary. It's an old blueprint for certain failure.<p>And the tablet PC a precursor to the iPhone? Excuse me but the iPhone is a phone. It's primarily a communication device on which people play some games as well, and a very small minority does one or two other things with it. Is everything with a touch screen now a would be iPhone?<p>And then there's the NTFS successor. As far as I remember it was not planned to be a distributed file system or some kind of virtualized cloud/cluster thing. It was supposed to be a file system that had database-like features like a rich data model, and it used SQL Server technology. Scaling out was not the vision but that's exactly the point of ""cloud"" storage.<p>Microsoft as the largest OS vendor completely missed the boat on virtualization, which is probably the most important OS trend in the past 10 years. Ok, they took the next boat, but the fact that it's not even mentioned is telling.<p>And then there is Office collaboration. What a horrible mess. There's nothing even remotly usable. They piled on useless features in Office but stuff like editing a Word file in a group, something really obvious, is so horribly broken and has been forever. That's an anti vision.<p>So no, they haven't just been bad at executing. Their visions were either of me-too quality or the kind of failed platform grandstanding that IBM was known for.<p>That said, they have created some solid high quality stuff in the past 10 years as well. Windows is a good solid OS. .NET is a good solid development platform and C# hasn't stalled as Java has. They have opened up Office file formats and invented a sane alternative to PDF. It's good engineering work and a little bit visionary in some places.",1262252616

1024069,comment,1023663,1023663,0,0,gouki,,,"I'm a big fan of Wikilekas, but I see several things wrong with this approach.<p>First, it's the way they ask for donations. They close the website and it's almost like ""If you want Wikileaks, you have to pay"". I don't think this helps their cause in any way. I remember seeing a banner while the website was still live, but that didn't last long.<p>Also, I don't think they reached a point where then can't hold the website online. It's not like it's new.<p>Like someone else said, they don't tell what their expenses are, nor how much money they need.<p>On the technical side, I don't see the need for having MediaWiki running. It's not the most lightweight application, and since most of the publications are done by the team behind the project, maybe having an approach like <a href=""http://cryptome.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryptome.org/</a> would make it less CPU hungry and would not depend on so many resources.<p>Since someone mentioned the mirror on Freenet, here is the mirror on the Onion land: <a href=""http://gaddbiwdftapglkq.onion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gaddbiwdftapglkq.onion/</a>",1262250849

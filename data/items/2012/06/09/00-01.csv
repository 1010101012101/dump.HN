4086812,comment,4073309,4077143,1,0,mrb,,,"What I say is true for any size of rainbow table. It seems you forget that RT lookups require CPU resources in addition to mere I/O resources. There is <i>always</i> a number of hashes beyond which brute forcing them is faster than RTs. Sometimes this number is very high (billions of hashes), sometimes it is lower (thousands of hashes). It depends on many factors: RT chain length, speed of the H() and R() functions, speed of the brute forcing implementation, etc.<p>To take your example of a small SHA1 rainbow table of 20GB, assuming it has a chain length of 40k, looking up a hash in it will require on average 200M calls to the SHA1 compression function (assuming a successful lookup). A modern CPU core can do about 5M calls per second. Therefore looking up one hash will take at least 40 sec, and looking up these 6.5M LinkedIn hashes would take 8.2 years! (This is <i>just</i> counting CPU time, I assume the RT is loaded in RAM for a negligible I/O access time to its data.) A RT of this size would cover a password space of about 2^44. For comparison a decent GPU can brute force this many hashes concurrently at a speed of roughly 500M per second (see oclhashcat perf numbers on an HD 7970). Covering the same password space would take only 9.8 hours. Compare 8.2 years vs. 9.8 hours: obviously the LinkedIn hashes that have been cracked so far have been brute forced, not looked up in RTs!<p>And even if you leveraged GPUs to perform RT lookups, they would speed up the computations by roughly a factor 100x, reducing the 8.2 years down to 30 days, still unable to match the short 9.8-hour brute forcing session. (My friend Bitweasil is doing research on GPU-accelerated rainbow tables, see cryptohaze.com)",1339203081

The school system identified students who were likely to drop out of high school based on grades and behavior and kept them from entering high school to prevent them from depressing high school dropout rates. They would remain in 8th grade until they turned 16 and dropped out.<p>I was in high school in the 90's, and my classmates frequently failed and had to repeat classes. This usually didn't result in having to repeat an entire grade though, since our schedules were very personalized and classes could be repeated the next year or semester without interfering with the rest of the schedule.",1339203061
4086809,comment,4085318,4085784,35,0,fingerprinter,,,"<i>2) All new team members were automatically assumed to be terminated within a month or so. This was usually true. Any new employee that didn't pull their weight, sat around waiting for someone to tell them what to do, or lied in any way was terminated.</i><p>I've seen this more and more in places and I absolutely hate this. HATE.<p>Here's why.<p>#1. Some else mentioned ""gladiator school"" and I couldn't agree more. While funny, there is also quite a bit of truth to this. Programming et al is not sales and we should not treat it like sales. If someone isn't hitting their quota in sales, then sure, they can go (or stay for another quarter...who knows), but programming is different and we should have a different set of criteria for ""not making the cut"". But, by default, telling all new people ""you will not be here past 30 days unless you are pulling your weight"" is not the right way to motivate someone to do their best. Quite frankly, this is lazy management. EXTREMELY LAZY management (I'm saying this as a manager, fyi).<p>#2. I work for a multinational, so I also realize that most of these policies are in place where firing someone takes an act of god, but I also hate these policies b/c it takes so much out of the hands of the manager and removes responsibility from the manager. Bottom line, managers should be accountable for their employees and try to help them succeed. Policies like this make it too easy for below average managers to remain employed. And if there are few things I hate more than bad managers...we need many, many less bad managers.<p>#3. This is LAZY on the corporations part as well. I said it was bad management, but it is also bad corporate onboarding. The hard part of hiring someone, after finding a good fit, is bringing them up to speed. There are small things they need to know and, frankly, they SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ASK for, they should be told them on day 1. Policies like this make it all to easy to assume it is the new employees responsibility to find these things out. Hint, it is not.<p>What would I do? Well, as a former exec of a startup and now a high-level manager at a multinational, this is what I like:<p>#1. Have some sort of ""welcome to the company"" wiki page that has things like where to get the code, who to talk to about x, y and z, where to get access to various systems. What those systems are and why they exist. All high level stuff. Even more mundane things like communication channels and suggested software would be appropriate. Couple that with more mundane things like system setup, packages and versions to install (if needed).<p>This is all high level stuff. Almost anyone in the company would need these.<p>#2. for devs, how to setup the projects, get them running and showing positive signs they are working. All appropriate systems should be accessible and things like getting access to data, database etc etc should be something the person could walk through and do.<p>#3. Make sure the new employee knows they have a responsibility in this process to MAKE THE PROCESS BETTER for the next person. Meaning, as they go through the process and see something is wrong, missing or something else, they should fix it. This is the first positive contribution they are making. Inevitably, this happens and it is an easy and cost effective way to make sure the onboarding material is up to date and always improving.<p>#4. The manager must sit down, on day one and again at the end of the first week, and go over things like expectations, communication, reviews, how someone will be judged on performance etc etc. These are manager's responsibilities and set the tone for the company. If the manager appears disorganized, too busy or disinterested, imagine what the knew employee thinks? Take the time for the new employee...it is an investment...think of it that way.<p>#5. Give some clear goals for the first 30 days. You don't need to be concrete...but, point the person in the direction you want them to go and see if they start walking or running and see how/when they get to the point.<p>I could go on and on, but at the end of the day, I feel that lazy and poor management are a real problem and this point is an indication of that.",1339203054

I've been a fairly loud critic of ORMs since the first time I was exposed to them (Hibernate, as it happens)--having seen them in practice hasn't changed that a bit. The conventional opinion on them may have changed, but mine never has; mutable data structures increase code complexity and greatly increase the surface area for state changes in places it wasn't (or shouldn't have been) intended.<p>And you may not <i>need</i> mutability for EJB, but it's almost always the case that you <i>have</i> it--it's partly a side effect of having to deal with people like you who consider it ""not a big deal"" and partly because JavaBeans are completely misused[1].<p>(For those following along at home, who might not be familiar with the culture of Java programmers, mutability in absolutely bizarre places eventually ruins your day at least once. See, for example, the Date[2] class, which for some very Java-y reason is completely and totally mutable. Questions related to the Date class are among my favorites for determining whether a Java programmer has any concept of mutability, and why ""do you use Joda Time?"" is a decent barometer of basic not-going-to-kill-your-project competence.)<p>.<p>Seriously, though: is ""just get it working"" the entirety of your defense for diverging from good practices? This isn't just me calling it ""good practices,"" this is what Bloch says in head-shrinking detail in <i>Effective Java</i> and what pretty much everybody else who's had to write Java in anger eventually agrees with. This[3] isn't the best thing in the world on the topic, because I'm not going to quote <i>Effective Java</i> at length, but if you can read that and then come back with ""just get it working,"" I'm gonna have to go light a candle for whoever inherits your code down the line because I've been there (still am there, in the day job) and it's hell.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=84"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=84</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Date.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Date....</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=29</a>",1339201646

I try and be civil in my feedback for products I use even if I am pissed off because I know there is a human being at the other end and they are more than likely operating under similar constraints/deadlines/rules as everyone else in the world. Sometimes I disagree with their decisions, sometimes violently, but I try to approach the conversation from the mindset that they aren't simply doing it to annoy me, because they aren't.<p>>Claiming to paying attention to feedback when clearly not doing so is also quite frustrating.<p>Not sure how we could be considered to be ignoring people.

Feedback can be given, even at large volume, and <i>not</i> result in a change of course.

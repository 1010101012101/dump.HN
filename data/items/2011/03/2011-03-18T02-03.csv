The way the TDD/XP camp talk about software bums me out. As if the test they decided (key word) to write set the software on some Manifest Destiny vector to perfection.</i><p>The tricky part is that anything can become a cargo cult rallying point.  Mediocre programmers can drive anything into the ground.  Even a seeming no-brainer like the Law of Demeter can be misapplied to create byzantine systems if someone knows how write code, but isn't very good at it.  The situation is ten times worse with test code because it's meta—there's no objective measure of quality for test code.  At least with application code it's obvious for any user whether it works or not, but with test code it's all about how much manual testing time was saved, or how much smoother refactorings went.<p>I've long been skeptical of the claim that TDD or whatever makes you write better code.  The way I see it, TDD forces you to put in the time to learn how to write automated tests.  Once you are good at it, tests help you move faster by covering regressions and documenting your intentions.  In Ruby tests can give a nice sanity check that is built into strongly-typed compiled languages.  I truly believe in TATFT, but at the end of the day tests are still meta, and you can't polish a turd.",1300415760

The only star rating system that I've seen that's actually useful to a consumer is Amazon--but Amazon deals with finished, immutable works and products, not evolving, living software, where every single individual rating becomes stale with the next commit.<p>To address what antirez needs--an at-a-glance, summary assessment of the quality of the project--github could provide a standard rating of a number of dimensions. Project followers, recentness of commits, forks, merge history, code analytics, presence of tests, volume and activity on documentation, etc.  This is still subject to gaming, but here's how you fix that: allow each github user to express their own values/constants for the various measures, and allow you to assess any project based on what that user values: ""What would antirez say about a project with no documentation, lots of downstream forks, great testing coverage?""  Now you've introduced a trust metric, correlating values of people you trust with projects you might be interested in.<p>Think OKCupid meets GitHub, with bulk rating of projects rather than potential mates.",1300414964

We did not start of a lean and agile company like we read about everywhere, but this is rapidly changing now we found out who loves our product. This product market fit quest is not over at launch, it will only start all over again, but with a slightly more focus on business and enterprise, we should have iterations faster if needed.<p>A payment gateway and merchant account and thinking about how to get more users into out beta and future free trial options, got me thinking about the App Markets that now pop-up up everywhere. How would this benefit the Reedge.com Application?<p>Comparing apples with apples?<p>AppDirect and Google App Marketplace are a bit different, Google App Marketplace can be used for any application that integrates with existing Google API’s so for example we could use Google Contacts for multi-user features in Reedge or add a integration with Google Analytics and that would be enough to enter in the Marketplace. AppDirect required a deeper integration including sign-on and billing. But When looking at Google App Marketplace as a more integrated option including Google Billing API and Google Checkout the two services actually are very similar.<p>How to pick? Market-size?<p>Well it’s true everyone likes simple sign-up and sign-on so Twitter and Facebook integration could be an option. But Facebook Sign-On for a business and enterprise focused business does not make sense, so that leaves Twitter, OpenID and Google. Besides the ease of sign-up the market size is important with 2 million active businesses inside the Google App environment and 1.000 daily visitors of AppDirect you can see where I am going. Add the 24 available apps in AppDirect and 300 in Google App Marketplace, the 20% cut Google takes vs. the 35% AppDirect asks… the choice seems too easy.</p><p><p>OK if Google App Marketplace it is… what would that involve?<p>Well going with the idea of Google App Marketplace involves some important changes. Single-Sign On, more integration with Google Contacts, Google Billing API (that’s in beta) and a Google Adwords extension that we wanted, all need to move forward in our planning. So it’s not final choice, but something that seems worth exploring.<p>Anyone thinking here in Ynews of entering that Google App Marketplace and interested in sharing there ideas and experiences of the impact it had on their business and application?",1300413714

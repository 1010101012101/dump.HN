I've worked ICU for a number of years as well.<p>It sounds simple to institute a checklist, but the key issue isn't the checklist, it's about allowing nurses to hold doctors accountable and the hospital backing the nurses up in those disputes.<p>Say you're a night shift ICU nurse.  Your patient craps out at 3am, and your intensivist crawls out of bed to come and ""line up"" your patient and put them on life support.  Do you think that Dr. Intensivist with 15 years of school wants to hear at 3am is a nurse with an associates degree tell him to stop what he's doing and start over because he didn't wash his hands properly before starting.  I've had charts thrown at me for stuff like that.<p>This issue is accountability and incentives.  This plan places accountability on the doctors, but it puts a lot of strain on the doctor/nurse relationship when that nurse is the one blowing the whistle on the doctor.  <p>What we need is an incentive system for doctors.  You need both a carrot and a stick.  Doctors only get paid when the patient is sick.  And, if the patient gets sicker, that doctor spends more time with the patient and bills more.  There is no incentive to keeping the patient healthy, only payment for taking care of as many sick patients as possible.  Doctors don't like it they generally want to take good care of patients.  They just have to pay of $200,000 of student loans, and the only way to do that is to rush and see as many patients as possible.  <p>If the doctors received a large bonus every year if their lines did not get infected, or if their patients did not get a pneumonia when the patient was on life support, you better believe that complication rates would go down.  <p>If nurses got a small bonus every year based on our infection control practices,  we'd all wash our hands a lot more often.  But we don't.  We're all paid by the hour on a patient assembly line.  <p>The doctors or nurses haven't set up this system, the insurance system has. It's just the unintended consequences of our third party payer system.  <p>Although, there are winds of change.  Medicare is starting to threaten hospitals by not paying them if a patient gets an infection from the hospital.",1197118233

The main blocker is that they simply cannot write webapps. The interface for dealing with adcenter is amongst the worst webapps of all time. It's a very very slow painful procedure to get anything done at all. Things you can do in adwords in 5 minutes can take hours in msn adcenter.",1197117715

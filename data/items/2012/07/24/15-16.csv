For example almost no-one implements email validation correctly as per the RFC because it's hard to get right, and most people just use a hacky regex that ends up accepting invalid emails and rejecting valid ones.<p>Or with credit card validation, many places don't validate credit card numbers (i.e doing the validation checksum, checking if the card is a mastercard that it's got the mastercard prefix) before sending them to the card processor site. If the card processing services rejects the card and the user has to re-enter the card details, chance are they won't bother and you've lost yourself a sale. If you validated for obvious mistakes on-the-fly (i.e user sees error immediately) you wouldn't lose as many of those customers.<p>You could also do things like supplementing the user supplied data, say the user supplies an address you could automatically geocode it and put it in a hidden field for the website.",1343145274

4286143,comment,4283948,4285088,1,0,eshvk,,,"> I wasn't trying to make that impression. I just thought that most of Rwanda is still rather undeveloped and especially after the war/genocide a lot of people there still depend on the land for subsistence. Maybe I'm wrong, I've never even been to Africa, so if I am I apologize.<p>It is complicated. Rwanda is still undeveloped and there are a lot of people who do depend on the land for subsistence. Having said that, the bushmeat issue has gone beyond subsistence farming, there is a systematic plundering of Gorilla families going on (most probably with the connivance of government forces) where the gorilla mothers are taken for bushmeat and the young ones are taken to become pets.<p>> Well this one is tricky. I'm not trying to sound like an isolationist where we shouldn't interfere with anything. But there does seem to be something morally wrong in my mind if we interfere on behalf of nature to the detriment of the local people. Especially since we've already decimated most of our wildlife en route to our current living standards. Kind of hypocritical to then turn around and use that wealth to stop others from following in our footsteps.<p>Fair enough, you are entitled to your ethical standards. The reason I was pointing out that this is a false dichotomy is that it is not as if people are pouring all money into conservation at the cost of helping the local population. Money, believe me, is not the issue with Africa.<p>> Also just as an afterthought, it was my understanding that the war/genocide was largely manufactured by policies enacted by the retreating Belgians. Before we were there the two tribes got along for the most part.<p>I am rather unsympathetic to this viewpoint. Yes, admittedly regional issues 60 + years ago were exacerbated by colonial forces. I frankly think it is time to move on and start treating people like adults and expect them to grow up and solve their problems the mature way. We see the same issues in South Asia where people are engaging in Nuclear brinksmanship over a silly piece of scrap land.<p>> Yea, I know the track record on African Aid is not good. My comment was more that we should be at least thinking about their situation and empathizing with it. We should at least be understanding in our comments and behavior. But the tone in this article and likely also in the comments being sent to their facebook page makes the locals out to be the bad guy. I just don't think that's very helpful or deserved.<p>I think the ""locals"" are not a homogenous demographic. Sure there are starving people out there who are trying to get their next meal through hunting in forests. There also are several hungry armies using the forests as their pantry. We also have the ""noble savage"" (Pygmies) who spend most of the time in the forests and also get discriminated against (by fellow Africans, I might add). Another demographic is a group of poachers who systematically use sophisticated technology to hunt down endangered animals and transport the resultant products to markets in Asia. I think some of these groups definitely deserve sympathy, the others I could care zero fucks about. Also the discussion we are having is due to the complicated nature of the issue: It is extremely hard to try to get a macro perspective broadcast to the lowest common denominator (the Facebook commenter) in a way that easily understandable. Unfortunately, we kind of need to break it down so that conservationists can get money to fund their programs. The problem in doing such an approximation is that abstraction is rather leaky and leads to bike shedding.<p>> But to your point about giving aide, there have definitely been some mistakes made, mistakes that should probably have been avoided. It was stupid to ever assume dumping material goods or money into Africa would fix the situation. ""Give a man a fish and the local fishermen are out of a job"", that should be the proverb we learned from this. I don't really have great solutions other than the obvious ones: Education and stable just governance.<p>My personal opinion is that Africa would be fine if people didn't try to fix it every five years or so. Practically speaking, I know this to be a pipe dream considering the amount of weapons flowing in there and the next generation colonialism being perpetrated by China/India there.",1343144640

Building an image grinding pipeline is non-trivial, even though all the open source tools are of high quality.  Once users start uploading photos, marketing will realize that they need to be cropped, resized, and enhanced.  As soon as your users upload the first pieces of questionable content, you will have to build an image moderation app.  Then, you have to build a feature where the user sees his own photos on the site privately when logged in because users hate the lack of immediacy.  Then, your marketing people will ask for video.  Totally separate pipeline.  Then, someone will upload custom-generated 40Kx40k single-color jpgs to see if your image crunching pipeline allows denial of service attacks.  Once you get your first upload of child pornography, your legal team will become much more interested and ask how you are ensuring the destruction of these images from all your servers.

4286083,comment,4285171,4285171,6,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Rather than going after late fees, Ive found find it quite effective to offer ongoing clients a modest discount if they pay invoices quickly. For example, if our normal terms on a contract were 30 days, we might offer a client a couple of percent off if they paid within a week of the invoice date. This way, clients are at liberty to wait the full period if they want to, but it will cost them a little more for the privilege.<p>That seems to be enough incentive for a lot of places to pay early, particularly smaller businesses who arent on some fixed schedule run by a central accounts department. That in turn reduces the risk to my company, because typically weve only worked a little over a month before the corresponding payment reaches the bank, rather than having two full months of revenue at risk if anything unfortunate happens to the client.<p>Obviously this is all agreed up-front and terms are always negotiable, and for some larger companies this sort of scheme doesnt help because youre often looking at a longer payment window anyway. In that case, the basic rule is that the longer the window they want, the more the basic rate goes up and the bigger the up-front deposit before we start work.",1343143840

Maybe an ""I'm done voting"" button at the top and bottom of the page, which removes all voting arrows and replaces them with scores. The score for a comment could also be displayed after you've voted on it.<p>[The problem might lie in the implementation for this solution. You probably don't want to store the 'done voting on this story' information in cookies, since that's tied to a single device and vulnerable to user manipulation. This means that you need to maintain a list of stories for which each user is done voting in your database, and then check against that list on each page load. This adds a significant amount of server resource usage, as well as maintenance and performance tuning work for what amounts to an unnecessary feature. Showing scores for a comment after voting on it should be easy to implement, but then you'd be encouraging people to vote just so they can see a score, possibly even up-voting everything on the page.

In the case of the chinese wheelbarrow it is not clear that it was so superior to the european cart. A person simply can't move the same amount of material as easily as a pack animal. The chinese cart is thus tremendously labor intensive. One person must move a load that could be done by 1/4 of a pack animal on a wheeled cart.<p>Additionally, the one other advantage of being able to use the wheelbarrow on narrow paths instead of roads is not something that would normally matter. Roads can move people and goods much more effectively and faster than narrow paths. \nThe article alludes to this by referring to the collapse of the road network and the subsequent development of the wheelbarrow.  Of course, if they had roads, they may never had adopted to the wheelbarrow in the first place.<p>What the author describes as inventiveness is really necessity borne of weakness. Only if human labor is relatively cheap would such an invention ever be considered. China fit these conditions perfectly, however.

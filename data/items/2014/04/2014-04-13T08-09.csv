I would like to get back into reading that sort of thing, but it seems like I never have the massive amount of time it takes to get into stuff like that now that I spend a lot of time reading technical literature as well. Any ideas?<p>Edit: I also find a lot of technical/programmer/etc... types don&#x27;t really know much about film, which is really an amazing art form if you look beyond the typical hollywood stuff (e.g. Kurosawa, Herzog, Tarkovsky, etc...)",1397379545

If this guy was just an employee the tone of this thread would be very different. Every CTO knows there&#x27;s coders that can just drag down the efficiency of the team. Every programmer knows in his bones that some programmers are poisonous to your codebase, even if they get shit done.<p>So how about a third option: They are just trying to cut out dead weight from the company.<p>So yes, get an attorney, yes, make sure you get what you deserve. But don&#x27;t assume your friend (your cofounder is your friend right?) is backstabbing you before you are absolutely certain, no use in getting bitter before the hurt is done. A startup is a business, and businesses need to run efficient to succeed.<p>Asking you to leave, and asking it to be in three to six months, that&#x27;s quite different than doing it suddenly when your grandmother dies. To me it sounds like they&#x27;re doing it as classy as they can.<p>I&#x27;d say, if you really want to keep working with them, step up your game, make sure you&#x27;re the programmer they need.<p>In any case, lawyer up, you have risked a lot going into a startup, so you most definitely have rights to that slice of the money pie when it comes.",1397376635

Maybe it is just a simple case if you are currently contributing code to the idea to step back and let this other guy handle the coding aspect for you. Maybe you can better spend your time as a co-founder elsewhere in your company.<p>Having said that, if he is forcefully advising you to leave, he is overstepping his boundaries and you need to contain that fire now before he starts turning other employees against you. A toxic employee in a company is like a cancer, it will start in one area and if not treated, it will spread throughout every orifice in your body until it kills you.<p>If it is a simple matter of you&#x27;re making it hard for the CTO to do his job because you&#x27;re committing code and continually breaking things, maybe you need to step back and let him do his job. He can&#x27;t force you out of your own company, but he might have enough collateral (if he is truly instrumental in your company&#x27;s success) to get other people to listen to him and force them to make a decision. The CTO is either brutally honest, he&#x27;s an asshole or he&#x27;s gunning for your spot in the company.<p>I would be looking at this from all angles. Don&#x27;t just assume the CTO is acting alone, for all you know the CEO or your business part is instrumental in his push for you to leave. You&#x27;re not just an employee, you&#x27;re a co-founder and you have rights and responsibilities. You&#x27;re acting like the CTO has already one which will be your downfall. Exercise your rights as a co-founder to fix this.<p>I would seriously fire the CTO. He might have been instrumental in the companies success, but he has overstepped the line. He has gone beyond the point of merely telling someone they&#x27;re making his job hard, he&#x27;s asking a co-founder to leave. It&#x27;s like some manager at Microsoft asking the CEO to step-down, it&#x27;s just crazy.<p>Get legal advice ASAP.

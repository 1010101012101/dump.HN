185438,story,,,9,13,angstrom,"YC: Tales From the Startup Crypt",,"I'm currently working for a startup that has lasted 6 years without a series B. I was talked into joining it 7 months ago by a friend, but ever since then things have been downhill. Recently the VCs brought in a consultant who basically was the CEO of another failed startup which died before it got off the ground. He in turn connected us with another consultant who was key in turning a couple of startups around that are now major companies (if you've ever bought anything online you've used their services).<p>This guy was given the task of forming contacts with other companies that would be interested in our technology. We receive a forwarded email about a month later by our CEO (who has now basically given up most control to the VCs). In it is an email forward from this consultant to an interested company. The email is chock full of features and promised to be beta ready by June 1st. Our CEO sent this out to us and has denied in emails going back and forth that there is anything to worry about.<p>Engineering is ticked because none of this information was even checked with us to see how much work would be involved. Meanwhile, our CEO founder keeps saying we just need to get this one feature and this other company won't care. It really sounds more like a case of overpromise, under sell. Whether he realizes it or not, 4/5 of the engineers are actively seeking new employment.<p>Unfortunately, it gets more dysfunctional than this.",1210337143

You need to be ok at most things and really amazing at a couple.<p>My specialties are technology/coding and writing, but I'm also a competent consultant with the associated skills in management, negotiation, presentation, networking and business analysis, and since quitting my job have also acquired decent skills in online marketing.<p>Not everyone in your company needs to be competent in so many areas, but I'd suggest the CEO needs to be. At the same time, there needs to be at least one thing the CEO brings to the table that others aren't as amazing at as he or she is. Later on, when the company becomes larger, who the CEO attracts to work at the company becomes more important than what skills they bring in, but at the early stage everyone in the company needs to be amazing at something, and be involved in using that skill to create an amazing version 1.0.<p>Daniel",1210335812

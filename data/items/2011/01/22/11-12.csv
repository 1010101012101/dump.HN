You can say that the number of likes can be considered as karma, but that does not rank comments or links.<p>2) Though people there can be considered civil, not all of the comments are particularly interesting. I come to HN as 80% of the conversations make me go ""OMG, I never thought of it that way"". That didn't happen here. But again I just looked at a small sample.<p>3) I don't care how many members you have, you may have 10 or 10,000 the question is, how many of them are actively contributing at least mediocre quality content. Judging by the profile pics I see, it cannot by more than 40 and that too is a conservative count.",1295697442

2130319,comment,2129707,2130237,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"It really depends on what <i>easy</i> means here. Poor people might have to work more often and might have less physical comforts or conveniences available, and those things can certainly ease a subset of life's problems, but I wouldn't say that money automatically makes one's whole existence or life <i>easier</i>.  I've known several individuals more affluent than myself whose lives, at least in my estimation, are much more difficult.<p>Money can take care of some things, and the things it helps are nice, but I think it's important for us to have some perspective.<p>Wealth comes with its own worries and some of those that don't have these worries ought to be grateful that they don't. Beneath its luster, wealth is often regarded as a destroyer. Think about it: of the the few that are capable of obtaining wealth, fewer still are able to bear it without destroying their own life or the lives of many surrounding. Wealth comes with burdens. Can you bear it?",1295697222

Especially since SpamAssassin works so good.<p>What I do is the following: SpamAssassin rules + Bayes (currently about 200k mails trained, 25% of them spam) + URIBL. I think I could even tune that with Razor and/or Pyzor but I get to few spam to actually care.<p>Since that, I've given up hiding my mail.

Bad because this could turn into a time consuming enterprise sales process. And this isn't something you sell on the web with a website.<p>Good luck!

2130298,comment,2129755,2130179,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Python 3 is much more than a version number increment. Newbies are advised to use Py2 only because there are more libraries available for 2, and newbies are more likely to need more libraries. This is changing slowly but surely as more libraries go to 3.<p>2.7 is the last major release in the Py2 line. It's all Py3 from here on out, so people are starting to take Py3 seriously, as they rightly should. Python 3 is now the default distribution in Arch Linux and other bleeding-edge distros will be following soon. I'm kind of disappointed the major shift didn't start happening earlier, though the long cycle was to be expected.<p>""Stable"" and ""production-ready"" Python 3 releases have been out for about two years now, by the way, so this definitely isn't a case of everyone jumping over just for a higher version number, and Python 3 has been ""battle tested"" for a while. I'm sure as the real heavyweights like Scipy start seeing real Py3 usage, cpython3 will get a lot of fixes and improvements.<p>We're just starting to hit ""conversion critical mass"" where everyone is beginning to see it's important to upgrade Py3 soon. I would guess in the next year most major projects will have ports underway if not completed, so the Python world will be undergoing a major transition this year, which may complicate things for a while but is for the long-term good of the community. :)",1295695895

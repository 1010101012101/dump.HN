10249337,comment,10248273,10248903,0,0,psycr,,,"I second the recommendation for MM-M, after recently reading it. You may find the chapters around how to structure a team to be interesting. Here&#x27;s my review (posted elsewhere):<p>----<p>I decided to give MM-M a read, after seeing it repeatedly listed as one of the classics of the fledgling - as the book maintains - field of software “engineering”. Despite a few dry chapters extensively detailing the development of OS/360, the book holds up remarkably well for being forty years old. Indeed, many of its central, oft-repeated development aphorisms still hold value. Unfortunately, its advocacy for extensive and exhaustive planning and documentation cycles screams “waterfall”, and muddies what is otherwise - I think - a number of worthwhile recommendations:<p>1. Avoid the second-system effect by being ruthlessly practical<p>2. Build a prototype and throw it away<p>3. The essence of programming has an irreducible complexity<p>Aside from these, I noted with great interest Brooks’ suggested team structure which he refers to as a surgical team: 6-7 people in highly stratified, and complimentary roles, led principally by a “surgeon”-type chief architect. I’ve only worked within relatively flat team structures up to this point, typically set up in junior/senior relationships. Since this is a less frequently cited recommendation in the book, I’m curious to know if it has been implemented with any success.<p>Finally, this suggestion is tantilizing:<p><i>As a discipline, we need an extended information theory that quantifies the information content of static structures, just as Shannon’s theory does for communicated streams.</i>",1442786354

It did not pay particularly well, but it was still around the level that a lot of people with &quot;normal&quot; (none-STEM/Medical/etc type) degrees start at. After I got bored of it, I did some random consulting/contract work for various companies. A connection I met at one of those got me a job working for a company that would eventually wind up being purchased by IBM. At that place I was making as much as most of the people I went to high school with that were graduating with engineering degrees around that time and getting started in the industry.<p>My next place of employment after a few years at that company put my salary range into a level that basically none of my peers from high school are at, including ones that have STEM degrees and law degrees. The couple that went on to become doctors are just now finishing up their residencies and will probably be beating me soon.<p>One of my good friends from school followed a pretty similar path as me, and has an excellent job as a security engineer for a fortune 10 company without a degree.<p>Networking + ability will help a lot in making up for not having a degree.",1442785434

You can get the entire tree from any root post easily (everything shares the same root id) but getting the whole subtree beyond immediate children takes recursion.<p>I find that you don&#x27;t even have to worry about treating the data as a tree in most cases until the very end. What you want to actually deal with is a flat array with the ids (root,parent,id) arranged in rendering order, and to have the tree built in the HTML. The data set from the DB doesn&#x27;t even have to represent the tree structure directly, as long as you can sort it elsewhere.<p>You can even have two arrays - one (say, an associative array) with the data, and another basic array with the ids. Sort just the array with the ids, then use those as keys to iterate the data array when building the html, so you can avoid ever having to sort the larger array (which as luck has it just happens to be optimized for non-linear access anyway.)<p>I should probably mention, I thought this was terribly clever when I did it in PHP, before I was aware that all arrays in PHP are basically the same, so it was mostly pointless overoptimization.<p>Building something like an unordered list in HTML from that array then becomes a matter of adding or removing <UL> elements based on the relative change in depth for each subsequent id. Depth is easy to find by checking if an item&#x27;s parent is (or isn&#x27;t) the same as the id of the previous element. The actual tree never exists in code until the unordered list is rendered in the browser.<p>Also here&#x27;s a good reference on Stack Overflow of different methods to do the same thing: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2175882/how-to-represent-a-data-tree-in-sql"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2175882/how-to-represent...</a><p>If you actually know what you&#x27;re doing beforehand, probably ignore everything I just said and go with nested sets.

As a result, the education industry created the monastery, the university, and the liberal arts college - all of which focused on conceptual mastery.<p>Conceptual mastery education did not and will never replace vocational mastery education. It simply provided another path to success for a select (but still growing) fraction of the population.<p>However, both conceptual and procedural mastery are becoming obsolete in the face of technological advances. There&#x27;s no reason to memorize calculus formulas or accounting algorithms where they are already stored in code libraries distributed across the globe and available at the touch of a button. There&#x27;s no reason to learn how to build air conditioning systems when a robot can do that faster, more efficiently, and more reliably. These days, we&#x27;re even automating roles involving human interaction and medical diagnosis.<p>So what kind of occupational roles will last in a world where responsibilities of ever increasing complexity are being automated? What qualities will those roles require?<p>My answer is that the required qualities will be:<p>The detection of highly complex and possibly almost abstract problems (Predicting consumer intent, for example),<p>initiative & drive (Let&#x27;s face it: dealing with complex issues is exhausting. That&#x27;s why we create stereotypes & labels. That&#x27;s why we give directions in landmarks or major roads. That&#x27;s why America has a two party political system.),<p>and the ability to conceive of and create solutions, whether those solutions take the form of physical devices, abstract systems, or human organizations.<p>Just like educational institutions focused on conceptual mastery did not and will not completely replace institutions focused on procedural mastery, my institution will not completely replace current liberal arts colleges. I do think that I will take a significant (and ever growing) fraction of the education market, however.",1442784435

As long as you have one &quot;alpha&quot;, a designated or undesignated person who makes a call when contentious views are blocking progress.<p><i>I believe that a flat structure would be best</i>  \nYou&#x27;d want to be careful of premature optimization here. I know what you are trying to get at (i.e. ensuring that you are setting up titles and roles that people can grow into), but this may not be the right time to do it.<p>Any structure is good, bad, best depending on the situation you are in, the size of the group, the problem you are trying to solve etc. The point is not to see hierarchy & structure as inhenrently good or bad -- but to work back from what you are trying to accomplish to the structure you need. Lets say you were trying to organize a 6 month expedition to a remote area with a group of people that you just met. How would you or this group go about it? I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d setup titles or hierarchy -- you&#x27;d probably go with &quot;role clarity&quot;, and doing things that engender &quot;excellence&quot; in their respective tasks.<p>In a startup, one expects an organization to be driven by passion, creativity and very little structure. This is an important part of why people are there. Traditional forms of motivation or organization often don&#x27;t work very well (e.g. hierarchy money, title or fear). Once the group is large, then there are companies that go for military style &quot;command & control&quot; structures. Even military is organized differently during war time and peace time. This comes back to the context of your particular situation & what you are trying to do. Are you in war time or peace time? :)<p>The most important thing is that you have a process that everybody understands -- you may never codify that process, but everyone on the team should know that it is there. And the process is: &quot;To get things done & make a difference&quot;. What is the best way to do this?<p>You want to give a sense of progression, via money & title etc. These are good things, but there are more levers you can pull. In a small group, it is obvious who is kicking-ass and who isn&#x27;t. You should let them, create an atmosphere first where they can do this -- and then, when they are. Talk to them about what they want. Do they want to run a team? Do they want more money? Do they want a more senior title? Do they want more free time? Do they want more flexibility? Do they want more responsibility (e.g. looking at 3 workstreams, instead of one)? Your answers will evolve. But don&#x27;t take your eye off the prize -- and the prize is to create an atmosphere where people can excel.<p><i>Judging merit</i>  \nYou make this sound hard, but is it? In a small group, isn&#x27;t it obvious when someone is kicking ass? The problem you are worrying about is that when somoene is kicking-ass, how do I make sure they are rewarded, so that they continue kicking ass. I would say, let people kick-ass first, and understand why they are -- lets say they inherently love &#x27;solving problems&#x27;, then give them problems to solve that honors & respects their talents.",1442783388

Downloadable all over the place.<p>* Apps like Memrise use a similar delayed repetition method. Read up on how to improve your memory, which a memory palace and vivid associations, and use those techniques.<p>* Read children&#x27;s books. Start at an early-grade school level and work your way up. Find and use bilingual editions with matching page translations to make it easy in the beginning. Work your way toward Harry Potter level (it&#x27;s been translated into many, many languages, including Latin.) Finally go for the simpler of its great authors. In English, that would be Hemingway.<p>* Learn old children&#x27;s songs. Putting a foreign language to music makes the phrases more memorable, and will also take you one step closer to getting a feel for the new culture and people, who have those songs rattling around in their memories... Then start listening to the ballads of the language. In French it might be Jacques Brel.<p>* The key is to maintain a feeling of mastery and progress while challenging yourself enough to improve. Don&#x27;t fall into the trap of dry grammars.<p>* Seek out immersion. Talk radio stations in the language you want to learn are probably online. Listen to them while you walk around or are falling asleep. Some languages like Swedish have online radio specifically produced for foreigners.\n<a href=""https://sverigesradio.se/sida/default.aspx?programid=493"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sverigesradio.se/sida/default.aspx?programid=493</a><p>* Find multiple text books or primers that teach the language you&#x27;re learning. Each one will have different strengths and weaknesses. When you bog down with one, switch to another.<p>* Remember that progress learning a language isn&#x27;t always linear. It spikes and plateaus. Don&#x27;t get frustrated, just keep exposing yourself to the parts of the language and culture you&#x27;re interested in.",1442783206

The concepts clash and it&#x27;s kind of a pain, but possible since every post has 1 unique parent, so you can make upwards references and rebuild a tree from that.",1442782835

Look at how many products AVG has. I think they should do just fine by converting free users to paid subscriptions.  Couple of years ago most of their revenue came from toolbars. Since then they have converted their business model to push more for premium upsell. They do it well, I don&#x27;t have problem with such a business model. Free users serve them well as free marketing force, they don&#x27;t have to abuse them.",1442782834

It kept launching instances, and due to the API outage we couldn&#x27;t manually kill the instances either...<p>So we wound up with over 1,000 of these machines running which then due to our fan out of their DB they needed to load into memory from other machines, our whole environment crashed until we could kill off the erroneously launched instances.<p>This meant an effective full reboot of our entire platform...<p>It&#x27;s was not a fun weekend.",1442782801

9539874,comment,9539220,9539764,0,0,BinaryIdiot,,,"> The main criticism leveled against using libraries to manipulate the DOM is that it adds another layer of abstraction and subsequent maintenance overhead and also the perceived or alleged performance degradation in terms of time required to complete the operations.<p>I partially disagree with your assertion; layers of abstraction are not always bad and let&#x27;s face it the DOM API, while simple, isn&#x27;t as nice to write as jQuery due to its verboseness. But the main criticism I&#x27;ve seen is the size and speed, not abstraction and speed. If you&#x27;re working on a project that doesn&#x27;t require supporting older browsers then you don&#x27;t really need much of what jQuery includes except maybe its simplified API. Calling native query methods in the browser is always faster if they&#x27;re fully supported.<p>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend dropping jQuery for <i>only</i> performance reasons though. jQuery is awesome; it makes the DOM API less stupid and it helps a lot with older browsers.

WhatsApp on the old phone stopped working because the account had been used on the new phone so we couldn&#x27;t even look at the chat history without using the SIM card to reactivate it. Reactivating WhatsApp on the old phone involved some extra hassle because the two phones had different SIM card slot sizes. After reactivation we could look at the old messages before moving the SIM card back to the new phone but couldn&#x27;t transfer them, since WhatsApp chat history transfer on WP requires that both phones have an SD card slot.

It&#x27;s like saying &quot;There&#x27;s no real gain from jQuery, it just saves you a ton of time and energy but besides that it sucks&quot;.<p>This is a terrible idea. I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again unless you only have to worry about support the newest Chrome/FF and even then the jQuery syntax is MUCH nicer than plain JS.<p>It&#x27;s simply not worth a developers time to account for all the different ways to accomplish the same end-task in all browsers. I know that when I use jQuery I can count on it working the same in every browser without having to test it extensively. The same cannot be said for plain JS. I know this is getting better but if you need to support a few versions back of IE (8/9) then not using jQuery is like shooting yourself in the foot. I am fully in support of using less jQuery and being smart about caching selectors and the like but not using jQuery is very bad advice unless you are suggesting a full framework in it&#x27;s place which does all the things jQuery does.<p>Let&#x27;s take a quick minute and look at the company behind this site: <a href=""http://pixabay.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pixabay.com/</a> They are a picture hosting (possibly selling? IDK) site. I&#x27;m sure FOR THEM they can get away with just plain JS but for people actually building web apps or building multiple client sites it&#x27;s not nearly as easy. So not only do I think their site would be fairly simple to create without jQuery if we take a little look at the source we see THEY ARE USING jQUERY! Just think about that, the company behind a website urging you not to use jQuery is using jQuery on their own site...<p>Lastly using libraries that don&#x27;t use jQuery will (9 times out of 10) set you up for failure unless the developer behind the library did extensive tests in every browser. I personally am more a fan of things working everywhere then trying to shave off the time that jQuery might add. If you want to convince me on how bad jQuery is you are going to need to show some benchmarks to prove your point. I, for one, do not accept that across the board jQuery is slow and using native JS will make my app &quot;load and react blazingly fast&quot;. With or without jQuery you can write shitty code, it&#x27;s not jQuery&#x27;s fault it&#x27;s the developers...",1431531785

We actually went from 2hrs of meetings/week to <i>almost two full days, I&#x27;m not shitting you</i> (to be fair, they went a bit back on that and cut it down to one day fairly quickly, but we still wasted more time by becoming more Agile).<p>Then my job was to fix others peoples projects from companies that weren&#x27;t familiar with the technology they used as a consultant.

When companies do agile development well, it is effective at solving some of the worst problems that software development faces.<p>Apparently I&#x27;m in the minority for thinking that Scrum in particular is a pretty effective development methodology. I&#x27;ll tell you what our process is.<p>- Spend a couple of hours planning a sprint of work. Two weeks, in our case. During that planning meeting, look at the backlog of features and tickets that the product manager has built up. Identify tasks we can reasonably accomplish in that time frame, ensure we have enough information to start, and discuss each one so we have a clear idea of what it involves.<p>- Make sure that those tasks are customer-visible features wherever possible. It&#x27;s not always the case that this can be done, but it helps to provide feedback.<p>- 10-minute daily stand-up to discuss any issues and communicate who&#x27;s working on what. Also time for the product manager to feed back any information from outside the team.<p>- Work on some tickets. Review the code. Pass them through QA. Deploy them. Let the product owner receive feedback from customers.<p>- Review the sprint when it&#x27;s done – take an hour, discuss what went well, what didn&#x27;t go well, and anything we can improve.<p>That&#x27;s the core of Scrum, and I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with it. The problem arises when it&#x27;s abused; story points as burndown charts, or productivity monitored in terms of &#x27;number of tickets finished&#x27;, or whole-company stand-ups, or whatever.<p>Agile development works well if you&#x27;re agile. It&#x27;s not a set of rules that <i>must be followed</i> – it&#x27;s a set of guidelines that can help to improve the development process. If you are performing useless, time-consuming overhead tasks, then you are not doing Agile – end of story.",1431530647

The problem is that it discourages actually swimming, and people forget how.<p>To explain: where this sort of project management actually works is in a short-term, time-limited crisis that large companies might call a &quot;Code Red&quot; or (in the original meaning of the word) a Scrum. See my Quora post on the topic: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-developers-at-strong-companies-like-Google-consider-Agile-development-to-be-nonsense/answer/Michael-O-Church"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-developers-at-strong-compan...</a><p>When you&#x27;re a small web consultancy that has landed a make-or-break project that (say) must be delivered inside of 4 weeks, and when you have absolutely no leverage and must accept any changes in scope as they come, Agile can work. You can reasonably expect people to set aside their long-term goals (career progress, tech debt reduction) and solve the problem at hand. Moreover, when you&#x27;re a big company fighting a Code Red (meaning, money is being lost right now in large amounts) and have to assemble a cross-cutting do-nothing-else-for-now team with no clear manager, Scrum can actually make sense.<p>In a true sprint-- a short-term reorganization necessary to solve an immediate problem-- unsustainable effort is OK because, well, no one&#x27;s going to be expected to sustain it. You&#x27;re under a short term emergency. You can ignore whether the assigned work helps peoples&#x27; careers, because they&#x27;re not going to be doing it for long. You can mandate that people work on the &quot;official&quot; top priority (of which there&#x27;s only one) and most people will do so.<p>The problem is the perma-Scrum that&#x27;s been sold (dishonestly) by the Agile industry. This stuff works for a few weeks and people don&#x27;t mind doing it. In fact, even if the work itself is painful and the hours are bad and status updates are (by necessity) frequently demanded, being tapped for the &quot;elite emergency team&quot; is something that people generally like and, over a span of 2 to 6 weeks, it gets results. However, when you have permanent &quot;sprinting&quot; and frequent status meetings or impose these rules over the whole organization, it starts to hurt morale. It starts to feel less like being on an elite emergency team and more like a culture of permanent juniority/micromanagement... which is what Scrum/Agile has become in many organizations.",1431529981

Scrum&#x27;s meant to be an alternative to - even an inversion of - the traditional way of running software projects.  But as it passes through the kaleidoscope of corporate culture, it&#x27;s all too easy for scrum to just become a layer of makeup on top of the traditional approach.<p>For example, Scrum has a &quot;scrum master&quot; role that is most certainly <i>NOT</i> that of being a project manager.  But usually a project manager gets placed in that role, and is naturally going to interpret the role by finding and then exaggerating analogies between it and the stuff they learned in PMP class.  In the more traditional structure that the &quot;project manager&quot; role comes from, the PM owns and dictates a lot of the processes that the team follows, including daily meetings and suchlike.<p>This is in direct conflict with the idea that the entire scrum team owns and collaboratively determines the processes that they follow.

You have got to be kidding me.<p>It&#x27;s been mentioned on here a lot that if you have a skilled set of programmers on your team you probably don&#x27;t need Agile.  They are self-managed and tend to do the Right Thing (TM) on their own.<p>I have seen Agile work and when it does it&#x27;s pretty fun.  Things move along, issues are dealt with, and nobody panics when things get behind a little.  Just move it to the next release.<p>I think the problem is that The Consultants sold Agile to enterprise dev shops and they really ate it up.

One of the cultural challenges that humanity faces is making Play align with bigger goals -- for example, if you love carpentry, you might volunteer with a shelter building program for all the &quot;wrong&quot; reasons, but yet... houses get built and (probably most important) carpentry skill gets developed in humans.<p>I would agree that Eve might be a complete waste of time, along with soccer and chess and (my favorite) Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, but I think the instinct to Play is very real and very productive, it should just be channeled intelligently.",1431529328

9539402,comment,9538508,9538508,0,0,srmann,,,"The idea of lowering the learning curve for website development has fascinated me for the past 10-ish years during my employment in the content management system industry. Every once in a while the idea that a tool can replace a developer surfaces, energizes a few people, and then falls flat for one reason or another. Yet it always resurfaces, likely due to the revolutionary nature of a successful solution.<p>The most common reason for failure I&#x27;ve seen seems to stem from the idea that a website requires a developer due to a website requiring massive amounts of meticulously written text in an esoteric language; by replacing this text with a graphical interface, a website no longer requires a developer who understands how to write this text. Experience leads me to believe a developer serves a much different purpose in building websites.<p>Consider applying this logic to another problem, such as writing. If one builds a tool allowing non-writers to drag correctly spelled words and punctuation onto a page, then a non-writer now has the ability to write gripping novels, impactful research papers, and influential editorials -- and they can do this without knowing how to spell. This doesn&#x27;t make sense, of course, since writing a book requires a certain understanding of how to communicate effectively, an achievement demanding a much more clever tool.<p>Much like writing a book, writing software also demands a much more clever tool than a graphical, drag-and-drop interface. Developers understand more than how to write text in odd languages; they understand how to solve problems. Creating a graphical interface for building websites doesn&#x27;t remove the necessity of a developer. On the contrary, it creates more jobs for more developers who specialize in building applications using a drag-and-drop interface.",1431529292

If setup is complex & lengthy consider creating virtual machines for devs (transparency & blockchain hack &#x27;14). Consider having an harassment policy (tcd sf &#x27;13).<p>Rehearse: if it&#x27;s your first and you&#x27;ve many people coming, rehearse when doors open & devs pile in. Rehearse the hacks, make sure presenters can easily connect to the projector, have screen settings correct, sound on or off, have right sound level, know how to use a mic. If you&#x27;ve lots of demos - ideally have two podiums. If someone&#x27;s preso can&#x27;t start or gets stuck, you can quickly switch over to other podium.<p>Scribe: Have a hackathon scribe. Blog before/after the event. Create a tweet handle. During rehearsals create tweet for each pitch describing what it does & handles or name of at least the team leader. During each pitch, send out their tweet. Tweet each and every winning team. Tweet thanks to your sponsors.<p>Guides:

9555129,comment,9549857,9552411,0,0,tomhoward,,,"An operating system isn&#x27;t an emergent property of a hard drive. An operating system emerges out of the minds of the many programmers who work on it, out of the interactions these programmers have with each other and with their users, and out of the society in which they live. It then gets installed on a hard drive by a human, after which it can function by interacting with the computer&#x27;s hardware.<p>This is really the point the author is making. There is no reason to be certain that consciousness (the reflective, emotional, inner experience that is distinct from logical intelligence) emerges out of the hardware of human (and other animal) bodies and brains, as no empirical evidence for such a process has yet been found, after several decades and vast sums of money invested looking for it.<p>Just as an operating system is a separate entity that needs to be installed onto the computer for it to be able to work, it (in the view of the author) is plausible that consciousness is something distinct from the physical matter of the body and brain.<p><i>It&#x27;s entirely possible that we could observe and measure consciousness if we knew what to look for.</i><p>Well yes, exactly, and Kastrup&#x27;s point is that the conventional fixation on matter (which to date has proven fruitless) is a distraction from other possible answers.",1431753237

My routes have dedicated bike lanes for about 1/2 the distance, &quot;sharrows&quot; (bike sign + >>> symbol) for about 1/4 and nothing on the rest. I&#x27;ll agree that the sharrows don&#x27;t seem to do much, but we seem to get along pretty well with cars anyway - with occasional friction. I feel pretty safe.<p>I rarely see bikes impede traffic. They either ride with the flow of traffic or stay right if they can&#x27;t keep up. Once in a while when the road is very narrow or torn up they might slow traffic a bit, but then get right ASAP.<p>In 2 years of daily commutes I&#x27;ve seen only 1 instance where a bike impeded a car for more than a few seconds, and that&#x27;s because the road was so torn up on the right hand side that it wasn&#x27;t usable, forcing bikes into the middle of the lane for about 10-20 seconds. The driver tailgated closely the whole time and started honking - in ignorance of the law that bikes have 100% right to the lane if there&#x27;s not room to share it with a 3 foot margin.<p>Bikes often won&#x27;t go super close to parked cars for fear of being &quot;doored&quot;, but they generally seem to ride at least 10 mph, especially where they need to occasionally weave into the main traffic flow, e.g. for double-parked vehicles.<p>On my route the only place it gets a little crazy is where you&#x27;re in 4 full lanes of traffic and have to cross from right to left in about 200 feet. All the bikes ride between lanes and generally weave their way over in the heavy but fairly slow traffic.<p>I&#x27;ve never had a reportable close call or seen an accident, but there are plenty of annoyances. Busses seem to make it a sport to brush close to you or cut you off - much worse than even large trucks do. Taxis are jerks. They blast by with inches of room. Expensive german SUVs are next worst. Always in a hurry. Oddly I&#x27;ve noticed prius drivers are pretty bad too, pedal to the metal. I don&#x27;t get it. [edit - these are gross generalizations, and even then only apply to a small fraction of the driving population. The vast majority are careful and polite!]<p>My fellow bikers are not always prize material either. For too many, red lights seem not to exist at all and they blow through with barely a glance. There are the invisible bikers too, riding at night with no lights no reflectors, and wearing dark clothes. Freakin&#x27; morons. I look like a total dork/xmas tree, but I&#x27;m visible.<p>I get very annoyed at people who drive right over my bike lane when there&#x27;s plenty of room not to. They&#x27;ll go past me then get slowed by traffic and block my lane - which is painted bright green btw, with white borders. Pretty hard to miss if you&#x27;re not on the GD phone. I&#x27;ve even yelled at them &quot;bike lane!&quot; a few times. (dumb, I know, and I&#x27;m trying hard to chill. Yelling doesn&#x27;t help) Another pet peeve drivers who stop way right in the lane so I can&#x27;t even squeeze by. It&#x27;s only a few rare cars that do this, but it only takes one to screw you over. Drivers - please leave me at least a measly 2 feet!<p>All in all, I <i>love</i> my bike commute. It&#x27;s honestly my favorite part of every day - at least when it&#x27;s above freezing :). And I strongly wish more people felt safe to ride, because I like the company, and feel even safer in a pack than alone. It actually gets pretty congested in places during rush hour (a dozen bikes at a light isn&#x27;t uncommon) but I say the more the merrier.",1431753037

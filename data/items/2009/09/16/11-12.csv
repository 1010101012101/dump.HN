That there are differences is blatantly obvious, though I can't claim to completely and precisely understand the nature of those differences.<p>However, I do strongly suspect that catering to certain common learning styles would severely disrupt the status quo in today's school system, and that research which recognizes those styles is not received with enthusiasm.",1253102388

Reports by security experts such as Bruce Schneier have since revealed a number of flaws in the technology, including password hashing and encryption issues.<p>IPREDator co-founder Peter Sunde, who also founded popular file-sharing site The Pirate Bay, told iTnews: ""128-bit encrypted PPTP can probably be broken by someone that can eavesdrop on the traffic.""\n</quote>",1253102139
825607,comment,821462,821981,0,0,messel,,,"Thanks yef. While I don't agree, perhaps it's a cognitive bias of mine? I need some down cycles, or to chew on a different topic or listen to music to let my brain breathe a little. Perhaps our individual nature plays very much into our creative aspects. You, for example are at your most creative when at the grindstone pushing yourself forward. I always have my best concepts in the foggy moments after waking up in the middle of the night. Walking is like meditation for me, and gives my brain a chance to wander/explore a problem space without judgement.<p>Actually building something requires ritualistic dedication though. Coming up with the original inspiration, not so much.",1253101960

After all, paying for unfinished job is at least reason for a trial, and good pre-trial strategy is to look for a pattern.<p>Of course, you don't have to actually do this (though I was prepared to at the time), but hopefully you won't need to.",1253101431

For that reason, making a sweeping statement about what ""the data"" proves or disproves carries zero weight with me.  Show me your data so I can decide for myself if it actually supports the conclusions you have drawn.

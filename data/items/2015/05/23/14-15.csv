9593091,comment,9591528,9592754,0,0,6d0debc071,,,"The same could be said of making your staff drink honey when they come into work. If it&#x27;s not increasing their productivity, perhaps they&#x27;re simply not drinking enough of it.<p>It&#x27;s true enough that nothing will work if you don&#x27;t sufficiently commit to it. The limitation with the observation is that it doesn&#x27;t show how well associated different stimuli are with the desired output. Did torture not get the truth, perhaps you just didn&#x27;t use enough of it? Did dosing someone with Omeprazole not cure a cold? Perhaps you didn&#x27;t use enough of it... and so on. Or perhaps it&#x27;s not the right approach.<p>What we can say in general terms is that if you need a lot of something, the desired effect is at least only weakly associated with the stimuli. It might be possible to get the desired effect by using more of the thing, but this is a poor substitute for understanding the mechanism involved, and can be prohibitively costly; ethically and practically.<p>In the given case: being an arsehole, for all that it comes easily to the individual, seems likely to be expensive to those around them - and by extension to the organisation - in other terms. There are people who will refuse to work with you because you&#x27;re an arsehole. There are people who will burn out if you push them too hard. There are people who will keep their own counsel on issues rather than attempting to involve you in things. There are normative arguments that you won&#x27;t be able to make, because no-one will take them seriously coming from someone like that.<p>Balanced against the uncertainty that the output is even there, (anecdotes seem to go both ways on the issue,) that it does not match how I would expect productive working relationships to operate, and that I personally have never seen an effective team that I would attribute to the manager being mean, (and a great many ineffective teams that I would attribute to the same,) it does not seem a wise strategy to me.<p>Though, that said, you might be bringing a different model of productive working relationships, or a different basis of observation, to the discussion. (Or be playing devils advocate.)",1432393156

9593077,comment,9592601,9592601,0,0,zvrba,,,"It seems they&#x27;re benchmarking on toy programs to create media hype. In my previous job I found out two non-removable bottlenecks in C++ builds: 1) linking (I don&#x27;t know of any parallel linker), 2) IO (writing of debug information). None of this is relevant in their benchmarks.<p>In my case, the build result, in _release_ mode, was a DLL file of about 40MB, and corresponding debug info of about 100MB.  In _debug_ mode, multiply debug info by a factor of ca 5-10. (Individual PDBs on disk collected together were ~GB, but final PDB was smaller.) Release parallel builds on a 4-core machine, with optimizations and all, (with HT) were noticeably faster because they generated less IO.<p>Link time of _another_ DLL consisting of many (thousands) separate object files took more time than compilation itself.<p>There&#x27;s also another product (I won&#x27;t name it because it created more problems for me than it solved) which integrates in VS and seamlessly distributes the compilation over machines in the local network. I stopped using it because it often generated corrupt PDB files and messed up IntelliSense in VS.<p>To summarize, I have two issues with their system (apart from &quot;good enough&quot; solutions for distributed compilation already existing): 1) they say nothing about speeding up the linking stage, and related to that 2) if they mess with linking, I&#x27;m not confident that they are reliably handling debug info.

It&#x27;s how two actors come to an agreement.<p>Even if negotiation is banned for determining salaries, there are other negotiations to be done: how much vacation you get and when you can take, when you can work remotely (if at all), who gets which projects and which roles in them, who gets the better desk, who gets to go to the conference. Plus you have to negotiate with other companies about contracts, joint ventures, prices, schedules, and so forth. And the rest of life is a negotiation too, for the price of a car, rent, the price for the house, the cost of house repairs, where to go on vacation, and on and on right down to where are we going to lunch and who&#x27;s picking up the tab.<p>This is well-intentioned but the solution is not in the realm of possibility, like trying to solve broken bones by banning gravity.

If any of your peers are indeed &quot;small, insecure, and self-loathing,&quot; as you say, then it is probably a bad idea to try to share your happiness with them in the first place;  most especially if you are already braced for a negative response, but sharing the news anyways.  Your motive here would be really unclear to me as a third-party witness.  I&#x27;ll accept your assertion that what you&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t bragging, but it seems somewhat confrontational to go ahead and volunteer information regarding your successes under those circumstances.  If it accounts for 7/8ths of your problems with people misidentifying your attempts to share happy personal news as bragging, then you may have a more general social problem with knowing how to manage impersonal relationships.  I&#x27;m pretty bad at that, myself.<p>With regards to that remaining 1/8th, the way the speaker is conducting himself, what do you see the essential difference between bragging and sharing good news to be?  What is it in people&#x27;s demeanor or attitude that makes you, as an audience, feel that they are engaged in bragging?",1432390867

In fact, without careful consideration, dependent type checking can end up being undecidable!<p>Compare this to the polynomial type, where the parameters (item IDs, etc.) are right there in the value. We can <i>never</i> have an Action without the corresponding parameters (if we try, we&#x27;ll end up with a function rather than an Action, thanks to Currying). We can never switch the type of an action while forgetting to change the parameters; etc. Plus, of course, we&#x27;ve denoted a finite set of actions, rather than relying on strings (AKA &quot;stringly typed&quot; programming).<p>Another point to note:<p>> it&#x27;s simpler to directly call the right function, rather than over-engineering things with a short-lived intermediary representation.<p>Of course it would be simpler, but the <i>entire point</i> of the exercise is to use MVC to separate concerns, even though it&#x27;s clearly overkill. If we&#x27;re going to do MVC anyway, then the Action type provides a very simple interface between the Controller and the Model: the Controller just spits out an Action, the Model just receives an Action; no need for any further coordination. Plus, it&#x27;s all really easy to reason about and type check.",1432390062

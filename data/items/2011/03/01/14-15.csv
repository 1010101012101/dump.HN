2275591,story,,,12,8,rpweber,"Show HN: HotspotRobot.com - Discover the best restaurants",,"Hey HN Community,<p>This is my first submission, so go easy on me. I'm launching Hotspot Robot (www.hotspotrobot.com) which provides a new way to find the best restaurants/bars near you. Right now, we're launching in NYC, Philly, DC, LA and San Fran.<p>Here is a 60 second video intro which hopefully makes it clear how Hotspot Robot is different than alternatives like Yelp: http://www.vimeo.com/18023901<p>For those of you who can't watch the video, basically Hotspot Robot works by aggregating professional content - specifically ""best of"" & ""top 10"" lists -  from trusted sources (e.g. Zagat, the New York Times, Food Network etc) and shows you which restaurants nearby are on the most ""best of"" lists. Therefore, it focuses on showing you the favorites of the pros, as opposed to having you wade through both the good and bad reviews from random Yelp users, some of whom are legit, but many of whom are biased or clueless reviewers.<p>The goal of the site is to do a better job answering these types of questions:<p>* ""I need to meet my friends over in another part of town. I'd like to recommend a really great place. Which place(s) are the most highly regarded in that particular area/neighborhood?""<p>* ""I'd like to settle the debate about where in the whole city is the best pizza (or burger or steak or brunch etc). Which place in all of NYC (or SF etc.) is on the most ""best pizza"" lists?"" NOTE: see why Yelp kinda sucks at this: http://blog.hotspotrobot.com/why-yelp-kinda-sucks   and how we think we answer this question better: http://blog.hotspotrobot.com/best-pizza-in-ny-according-to-the-experts<p>* ""My wife told me we're trying a new restaurant called Marea in NYC. What's it known for? Is it on any 'best of' lists and if so, what are those lists?""<p>As of right now, we have the highest coverage in NYC but hopefully the site is still useful in the other markets I mentioned. I'd love for any HN participants in these markets to give it a shot and let me know if they think the service is useful (or if you're not in these markets but still wanted try it out, I'd love your thoughts as well!)<p>Again, any feedback you could provide would be super helpful.<p>Thanks a bunch!\nRyan",1298991441

Thanks for the interest and thoughtful replies.<p>I certainly have complaints about the dev process Apple has created but I stand by my statement that Apple has allowed me to connect to more potential customers than ever was possible before.<p>The web has been available to the average person for 10-15 years but that doesn't mean I would have been able to get those people to look at my product. If I held a yard sale I can't realistically say that I have a potential market of all 600k people in Baltimore. Maybe I put up signs around my neighborhood, a small number of people see them and an even smaller number go out of their way to see what I'm selling.<p>But if I'm given a shop in the high traffic inner harbor, I have access to vastly more people who will already be drawn to the area and happen to see my wares. And even better, that shop in the high traffic area is decorated nicely and already set up with a credit card processing system. All I need to do is line the shelves with product.<p>I'll stop before I carry the analogy to the point of silliness, but for me to succeed without the App Store would have taken a different kind of product, more infrastructure and a lot more time spent on the things I don't know how to do. Despite theoretical potential, I never would have made it happen. The App Store significantly lowers the barrier to entry.<p>When I started as a software developer I dreamed of having a product on the shelves at Babbages and CompUSA. I feel I've finally achieved the modern equivalent of that. I would not have been able to make that happen without the ecosystem Apple has set up.",1298990283

I didn't have any plans, I didn't know any people or places there, and I even didn't understand the local language.<p>I wanted to challenge myself, so I chose to have a flight back from the other airport, which was 600 km away from the place I had landed - that's to make sure that I will not spend all the time in one city - I must travel in order to get out of the country. Also, I decided, that in 2 weeks I must never pay for a bed - meet strangers, go to the places where noone goes, or sleep wherever and whenever I can - but prove to myself that it's possible.<p>Those 14 days, I spent traveling through the entire Portugal, was the most amazing time in my life so far. Every day I was meeting someone new and every day it was different experience. I was surprisingly lucky to be hosted by 10 strangers in 10 cities I visited, even though I often didn't know where I will be after a day - everywhere I went people were just saying to me: ""You must see <that> place, it's really worth and it's so close!"".<p>I still remember the conversions I had - every evening they were totally different, depending on the people I was drinking local beer on wine with: from a photographer of Porto sports magazine, and 40 years old famous Portuguese actor, who lived in the heart of Lisbon, was singing in French and preparing for the performance after a few days in Paris, to 60 years old Portuguese woman coffee shop owner, and exchange students from Turkey and Russia with their own culture and traditions.<p>However, I spent three nights sleeping on wild Atlantic beaches alone, which I had never done before. I also had a few days without seeing any people at all.<p>When I was back, I felt like I had learned more about life than in my whole academic year at university. I learned how to deal with myself during the permanent moments of uncertainty. I realised how often the problems are really not such huge as we tend to imagine. When you throw yourself into the world, in which you don't know anyone and noone knows you, you become responsible for every decision you make, - you always have to think forward, you can't be nervous or scared. Now I am no longer afraid of being with myself for a few days in the nature without any communication devices (including a computer - not so easy for a programmer) and without other people. Also, I started to love meeting strangers and learning about things I never imagined existing before.<p>That's a kind of experience, which nobody will teach you at university.

The study asked people to rate how acceptable copyright infringement was on a scale from 1 (completely unacceptable) to 10 (completely ok). The 70% figure is everyone who answered <i>anything except 1</i>. But clearly a 2 out of 10 is still not very positive, especially since in context it could simply have meant that someone found it bad, but less bad than e.g. benefits fraud. Only 20% gave an answer >= 7.<p>3. The study specifically asked about copyright infringement for personal, home use.<p>---<p>From the report (rough translation):<p><i>Seven out of ten Danes accept to some extent the copying of music and movies without paying for them. So long, mind you, as it is limited to copying for one's own use.</i><p><i>Thus finds the Rockwool Foundation's study of Danish ethical attitudes in 2010.</i><p><i>In the study, a representative sample of people were asked to respond on a scale of 1 to 10, whether it is ok to pirate music from the internet for personal use. Those who believe that this act is acceptable under no circumstances, corresponding to a 1, total 30%.</i><p><i>The rest, i.e. 70%, accept pirate-copying to some degree. 50% give a rating between 2 and 6. They're probably skeptical in relation to piracy, but they seem not to think that it is totally unacceptable. The rest, around 15-20%, rate 7 or higher. This group mostly or fully accepts piracy.</i><p><i>The views are different however for making money on illegal music downloading. The population has a somewhat stricter view on that. In fact, three out of four respond that it is absolutely unacceptable to retrieve pirated music online and resell it to friends.</i><p><i>The difference between the two forms of lawbreaking is also clear in the average for all responses.

I doubt it. Would people donate money if movies were released for free? Sharing is all fine for people, as long as it doesn't cost them too much.

The company where she suffered that probably had women in totally different areas that also suffered from that. That is despicable, dishonest and repulsive. But it doesn't have much to do with the culture of software engineering itself, which on a technical level is very egalitarian in terms of really not caring whether you're male, female or a super intelligent shade of the color blue.<p>Regarding the part about being lucky at working in companies with a large % of women in It, there are a surprising number of women in engineering departments in large companies, especially when the companies are not actual software companies, they do business in other areas and have large IT departments to support the business internally. Because the culture in these is not really a startup culture, you really don't hear about most people in there. For the most part they aren't posting in HN or doing technical blogs or participating much in the ""geek"" community - and so this community doesn't actually realize they exist, and when people talk about the lack of women in IT, they're really talking about the lack of women in the open source and startup cultures.<p>In the end, it sounds like she had a really hard time, but she got out in time and in one piece, and she's more productive than ever, which is great. And good to hear that the COO got kicked out, it's good to know insanity doesn't go unnoticed forever. Thanks for sharing! Best of luck with the new startup!",1298988545

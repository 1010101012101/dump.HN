More interesting would be a solution that uses the same space to show the rendered form and for user input. E.g. as you type ""<i>cool</i>"" the asterisks disappear and instead you see the italicized word.<p>Not WYSIWYG: What-you-see-is-what-you-get means you visually present to the user all the options available. The user should not have to happen to know a set of magic incantations.  Markdown requires magic incantations.  Some users know them, many users do not.

But other times -- much more often, in my experience -- you run across hidden technical challenges and limitations that led to what look like really stupid decisions until you understand the real motivation. And even when there were some really stupid decisions, it's often better to leave the system largely intact while you incrementally fix the stupid parts.<p>And, as I said before, sometimes it really does make sense to go in and start over. It's just that the line for when it's warranted may not be where you think it is.<p>As far as learning things go, providing your own implementation to solve a problem can be a great learning tool. Likewise, writing your own compiler, database, or web server can be an absolutely fantastic means for understanding these tools better. But it will rarely be the best means of solving a problem that requires a database-backed web application.<p>Reuse production-proven existing code and tools wherever you can when you're on the clock for a job or building a company, and teach yourself how things work on the side. If you build something so good that it's worth swapping in for the original and going through all the steps to bulletproof it for production, then awesome. If not, then you've still learned what you cared about learning.",1332881513

Get their business cards and spoof mail from one employee to the other, referring to events that occured at the convention to get people to click on shit that would be a trojan.<p>These trojans were rather sophisticated in that they would operate very very slowly to trickle pieces of information out. Sometimes they were very specific pieces of information.<p>I don't recall exactly how this was found out, but someones machine was being checked out - and in the process the trojan was found.

3763384,comment,3761013,3761013,1,0,ivancdg,,,"It seems to me that one of the reasons CDBaby was/is so successful is because its primary customers are <i>musicians</i>, rather than consumers of music.<p>Strictly speaking CDBaby sells to both categories (it sells a service to musicians, and CDs to customers).<p>But to me, as a professional musician, it seems that people buy less music in product form now. Therefore the real customers for music-based products are...the musicians themselves.<p>There are more musicians than ever before. All are competing against one another.\nAs a result, they are willing to spend their disposable income on promotions, marketing.<p>Providing a service like CDBaby's was a brilliant way of tapping into that emerging market.<p>What made it disruptive was: the price-point, the musician-friendly ethos, the dependability and speed of the customer service.<p>As a musician/entrepreneur, it seems to me that very few startups realize that they may be more successful asking musicians to pay for something than finding 'customers' for their 'products' in the old fashioned (read: recording industry) mold.<p>Of course spinning the story to sound musician friendly is delicate...and essential.<p>Do you see other opportunities for charging the growing contingent of musicians for a service that is worthwhile?",1332879374

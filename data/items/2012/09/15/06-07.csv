There was significant rioting across England in August of last year, which had a substantial racial element and which ultimately led to 5 deaths.<p>Radical Islamist and far-right groups are constantly looking to provoke anger and dischord, with regular demonstrations and counter-demonstrations by groups like Islam4UK and the English Defence League posing a real threat to civil society.<p>The American notion of free speech is reliant on a level of cultural homogeneity that limits the risks of political and ethnic tensions. Europeans are much more comfortable with the idea of limiting speech which is a threat to peaceful coexistence, because we are painfully aware of how quickly a society can degenerate.<p>Americans perceive free speech as an inalienable right, but the European perspective is generally that there is a careful balance to be struck between the right of the individual to self-expression and defending the political stability which makes such freedom possible. The provocation of social tension is very much perceived as equivalent to shouting ""fire!"" in a crowded theatre. A great many historical failures to strike that balance loom large over the European political landscape.",1347692399

They are wrong that nuclear power is inherently dangerous, or that it's bad for the environment when compared e.g. coal, or basically whatever other anti-scientific bullshit they care to trot out to support their anti-nuclear stance. The science is clear - if you are an environmentalist you should fervently support nuclear power generation because it stands head and shoulders above everything else in terms of safety and environmental friendliness...<p><i>... when operated responsibly.</i><p>Therein lies the problem. After what's come out over the past couple years about the shit that has gone on at Tepco and the regulatory authorities, it is hard not to take the view that most of these assholes in executive positions should be put in prison. Hell, if Japan is so dedicated to the death penalty, some of them make prime candidates for it. That they could show such casual disregard not just for the safety of the towns near their facilities, but really their entire nation and even region, is profoundly shocking to the point that it starts to make you question your fundamental assumptions of human nature. Fundamental assumptions such as ""human beings are generally not, as a rule, criminally incompetent psychopaths"".<p>I'm sure most of the anti-nuclear crowd in Japan truly believes the bunk science that supports their stance. Others might be more cynical. At the governmental level, however, I think (and hope) something a bit more introspective is going on. Namely, that <i>they have come to the realization that they can not be trusted to effectively regulate the nuclear power industry</i>. Not when the consequences of failure are what they are.",1347692388

4525494,comment,4524447,4524804,1,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"I agree with you wholeheartedly. I turn 22 this year. I feel like I'm constantly learning new things. Not <i>knowledge</i> -- that's easier to obtain than ever -- but hard-won <i>wisdom</i>. Despite that, the list of things I know I don't know keeps growing longer each day. Age matters. And I don't think the OP was disputing this fact.<p>Young people are constantly told that they're young and inexperienced and don't know much about life, all of which is true. However, this has a huge negative effect on their self-confidence and sense of self-worth. I'm starting a company, and the words I fear most at a negotiation are ""You're still young. What do you know about business?""[1] Not a lot of people say those words out loud, but most people at least hint at them. Those words <i>hurt</i>. If someone points out your shitty business practices or poor hacking skills as reasons to not do business with you, you can at least go back home and fix those problems. If someone says they're not going to do business with you because you're 22, then that's that. I don't know how prevalent this phenomenon is in Western countries, but I feel ageism is a huge thing in India.<p>You don't realize this unless you try to do things that people your age are not expected to do. Here's an anecdote: a friend -- let's call him P -- once interviewed for a senior-level position at a software company. P loves software and electronics and has deep practical knowledge about both. Not surprisingly, he did very well at the interview. According to the HR guys, he was <i>exactly</i> the kind of person they were looking for. So there he is post-interview, talking with one of the HR people about things he has built, when someone reading his resume notices his age for presumably the first time. Long story short, they swear at him for 15 minutes for wasting their time and tell him to GTFO of the building.

Yes, once it rejects the premise, it finds the premise holds no power.<p>The whole point of soft power isn't to take on cultural change head on. The meaning of subvert isn't to force change. It's to effect a gradual change, which will be seen over the course of a couple of generations.<p>Hollywood has immense cultural power over western nations; it can, and definitely has, changed attitudes on a number of topics over just a few generations.<p>The OP makes some good points that current western media depicts situations too far from the current core islamic nations to carry much weight.  The world depicted has to be recognizable, and I'm sure Sex And The City seems completely alien to Karachi (hell, it's still semi-alien to Des Moines). So Hollywood isn't going to carry a lot of weight there.<p>But the world of Bollywood films are not wholly alien to Pakistan. It doesn't matter if they consciously resist the messages because India is a Hindu nation. That's the whole point of soft power. It works anyway.<p>Think about this question- did the Mullahs and Imams in faraway lands approve Pakistan opening up to Indian film imports?",1347689729

It's better to com0liment your food intake with the occasional multi vitamin instead of a ritrual daily overdose  turning your pee bright orange.<p>The other aspect is that if you are low on vitimin D and start taking supliments then you will get aches and pains which feel like your bones are bruised in places.  DONT PANIC - this is a sighn that you were low on vitamin D and it is your body adjusting, it is normal and nothing to worry about beyond confirming you were low in that vitamin group.<p>But if you are that worried about lack of any vitamin then it is always best to compliment via dietary needs and for vitamin D you cant beat a nice walk outside at the right times.<p>Like any form of consumption be it vitamins, food, forum posts etc - the golden rule is moderation, moderation and moderation.",1347689715

Our goal is to help users organize and retrieve many types of information as well as facilitate collaboration. Lists can be anything: to do list, calendar, customer relations, playlist, and everything in between. By default, lists are private (registration is required), but can be easily shared with the Groupr community or friends. A simple permission set can be applied to shares, so collaborators can be allowed to view, edit and/or comment on lists.<p>And here it is:\nhttp://groupr.co<p>Usage cases:\n1) YouTube Playlists - Create a list of YouTube URLs and a nifty playlist app will show up.\n2) Databases (i.e. customer relations, places, events) - Lists have a rigid structure (schema). This equates to consumer-friendly databases with less than a minute of setup time plus simple sharing and permissions.\n3) Temporary lists - Grocery lists, to do lists, and other lists that are disposable in nature.\n4) Arbitrary information storage - Store information for easy recall, i.e. itineraries, notes, ideas\n5) Social - The site works well for sharing Top Ten or My Favorite N Things lists. We have a public community which is organized by tags.\n6) ? - Groupr has many other uses, it's up to you<p>What makes this different from Evernote, Remember the Milk, etc.?\nThe difference between Groupr and these other services is abstraction and structure. We do not focus on a specific use case (notes, to do lists), instead we allow lists to have any structure. Groupr requires that lists have structure and that all items in the list follow the structure (again, like a database). There are no limitations to the number of fields and many types are available (Text, Number, URL, Address, Date, etc.). Also, collaboration has been baked in from the very beginning, something other services do not focus on.<p>Mobile?\niPhone and Android apps are in the works.<p>Does anyone find this useful? I would appreciate any feedback or criticisms.",1347689512

4525480,comment,4520702,4520702,1,0,tsurantino,,,"Learn both. A lot of people say Ruby & Python are very similar, I disagree. They are similar in that, they look at similar problems (domains - although Python is applied in much greater variety by its community, ie. sciences, web, gui, server admin, whereas Ruby's popularity is primarily in the web). However, they are different in that their design and philosophical ideas stem from two very distinct ways of approaching the building of software.<p>It is commonly expressed that in Python there should only be one way, and only one way to do something (Pythonic). In Ruby, you can express yourself in a number of ways. Not in ways that are subjective to your taste, but subjective to the needs of your solution.<p>The way Ruby approaches blocks (and closures) is unique. There is no substitute and Python, and it forces you to code in a manner that is unique to the language. It exposes you to different design patterns and a new way of thinking.<p>---<p>To keep it short, learn what language best suits your needs. If you are doing this for fun and are just starting out, I recommend Python. Ruby does way too many things implicitly that it'd be hard to keep track for a beginner (but you can be pragmatic and learn as you go).<p>For resources, here are my recommendations per language:<p>Python:\n- Udacity's courses are fantastic. They are engaging & challenging. They will teach you the language features as well as resources. They also handle domains from debugging, to simple console software, to web applications. <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.udacity.com/</a> is your reference.\n- Learn Python the Hardway is usually a good way to breeze through the syntax.\n- Think Python - a fantastic book.\n- Dive Into Python 3 - also a great short intro.<p>Ruby:\n- PickAxe. Google this. Must read book. Absolutely <i>amazing</i> reference. I don't think you need anything else if you read this.\n- Rubymonk, if you want to do fun exercises. Also a good intro to the syntax.",1347689423

2963530,comment,2947519,2960186,1,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""your argument is [some are] not true Christians because they do not take their beliefs from [theologians]""</i><p>That is not an accurate characterization.<p>The core of Christianity can be summed up thusly: everyone sins and is controlled by a sinful nature, and therefore everyone deserves death.  Christ's death frees us from slavery to sin and redeems us from the deserved penalty of death, and Christ's resurrection ""births"" us into a <i>new and transformed life</i> (which grows over time.)  That transformed life is characterized by love, patience, reconciliation, forgiveness, mercy, humility, and so forth.   Certain people are ""not true Christians"" because they do not display even the slightest hint of that <i>new and transformed life</i>.<p>Having wrong ideas, even a lot of them, does not disqualify a person from being Christian.  Living a life that <i>hasn't been transformed by Christ</i> disqualifies a person from being Christian.<p>> <i>""write how to perform an exorcism or a laying on of hands in a way that is understandable. That is the important stuff right?""</i><p>The ""important stuff"" is the stuff that gets mentioned repeatedly and gets described in detail.  For example, a large percentage of the Bible is dedicated to teaching the concepts listed above.  The ideas of sin, death, repentence, resurrection, and transformation are each given significant attention on their own.  Additionally, several passages discuss the ideas all together; the book of Romans is a 16 chapter long, well-formed, detailed discussion of those principles.<p>Exorcism and laying on of hands are very minor, being mentioned on perhaps a dozen separate occasions, none warranting more than a few sentences as small parts of an ongoing narrative; as a whole they might make up a tenth of a percent of the Bible.  Even so, when they are talked about, the discussion is <i>very clear</i> and <i>completely understandable</i>.  There is no complex ritual surrounding either.  Jesus, or someone Jesus has given explicit authority to, simply gives a command to a demon to ""come out"" or places their hands on someone, and the demon obeys or the sickness is cured.  On occasion there is a simple prayer along the lines of ""Father, heal this person.""  That all there is to it.  Your assertion that they are unclear simply demonstrates that you're unfamiliar with the material you're trying to criticize.<p>> <i>""He wants to prove that he exists, but not in a way that we will actually know [because of] free will""</i><p>Several times in the Bible, God blatantly shows His presence and power, and yet someone still rejects or disobeys Him.  Overwhelming evidence does not render ""free will"" invalid; proof does not prevent disobedience.  God's decision not to offer proof is clearly not about ""free will"".<p>I think it's simpler: God is more interested in <i>advancing His goals</i> than <i>impressing people</i>.  Consider Jesus' miracles -- He never performs them as ""proof"" or in order to show off; He performs them as teaching or as acts of compassion.  The few times proof is offered in the Bible, it's to someone who already follows God and is looking for confirmation that a specific message or messenger is from Him, in order to move them to action.<p>This is consistent with the experiences my friends and I have had.  when my friends got GPS-style directions in prayer, they weren't ""proof"", but a means to an end.  When friends gave, or were given, very specific gifts (often to/from strangers) because of a command given during prayer, it wasn't about ""proof"" but about God meeting someone's needs.  When God told me to make myself vulnerable to someone who hated me, it wasn't about ""proof"", but about showing His love.<p>God continues to act in this world by truthfully instructing His followers.  Now, if one person who I trust is His follower says ""God told me X"", and then X is wrong, the theory would be disproved -- so the theory is falsifiable.  Amusingly, your counter-explanation of ghosts and white noise is <i>not</i> falsifiable; while I would expect ghosts and white noise to make the occasional mistake, they could just get really lucky.",1315263449

I know a developer team here in Toronto that got access to Surface's SDK and was overwhelmed by the demand of customers who wanted Surface apps built. One in particular was a large telco here in Canada, Rogers, that wanted to put one in each retail store. When you wanted to know about a particular phone, you would put the phone onto the Surface screen and then the screen would present all sorts of specs & pricing plans. When you were happy with your selection, the customer service rep would put their badge down (which contained some authentication info) onto the Surface and that would complete the transaction.<p>I'm not sure if the costs of these have dropped over the years enough to make it more affordable for 3rd parties to have at it, but it seems like a wasted opportunity that it was never really pursued in the first place.

To call this fact a <i>problem</i> good evidence is needed.*<p>Usually when this is called a problem it is done along with making the implicit or explicit suggestion that men in scientific fields are sexist and somehow discriminate against women. But I, like most men in science, would severely reprimand anyone who treats women unfairly. Therefore I find it extremely unwarranted and unfair that feminists think it is OK to accuse us of sexism without evidence. And I find it saddening that not more men have the courage to speak up against these accusations.<p>I'm sure there have been cases of discrimination against women in science, but this in no way proves that it's widespread, or that it's affecting the number of women in science.<p>[* The logic goes that since men and women are identical, there should be just as many women in science as there are men.

2963520,comment,2962165,2962698,1,0,mpk,,,"My guess is yes, they do.<p>If you read a bit deeper into their announcements you'll notice that this is not just 'the government taking over'. The breach post-mortem was handled by a private sector security company (Fox IT) and the SSL cert management was moved to another private sector firm (Getronics). Judging by the announcements this was overseen by the Ministry of Security and Justice, which has its own well-funded divisions of security specialists.<p>The Dutch government sees digital infrastructure as crucial and invests a lot of time and money into it. Components such as PKI government, etc are initiated by the government but then sourced to the private sector (a fairly common practice). This allows the government to revoke contracts or otherwise intervene if the contractor is in breach of something (bad management, bad governance, failure to comply with security standards, failing audits, etc). I'm guessing that this is also the legal basis for taking over operations from DigiNotar at such short notice.<p>Also, the Dutch government is a world-class player in the eavesdropping, interception, wiretapping and traffic monitoring game. That implies at least a basic in-house competency in network and crypto matters.",1315263074

So I would argue that no, it's not really sexist to use ""she"" as a pronoun, if you're doing it to be rebellious. It isn't about putting down men. It's about encouraging the visible presence of women.<p>The pronoun thing is probably a minor issue in the gender wars, though.

Then I saw the episode of Seinfeld where he did his bit about sports fans:<p>""We're a little too into sports in this country, I think we gotta throttle back. Know what I mean? People come home from these games, 'We won! We won!' No, they won - you watched.""<p>""They won, you watched.""  It really resonated with me.  I was spending quite a bit of cash to watch a bunch of fit guys try to kick a ball better than another bunch of fit guys in different coloured jumpers.  If 'my guys' won I felt good and if they didn't, I didn't.  It seemed ridiculous to me.  If they won, why should I feel happy?  I don't even know them!  And if they lost, why should I feel upset?  It wasn't my fault.<p>I haven't really been to an AFL game since then and barely watch it on TV.  If Collingwood makes a final, like they did last year, then yes, I want them to win and I will watch the game on TV.  But it doesn't go any further than that.<p>Giving up on the spectating didn't make me go out and play football myself, but I do mostly spend my spare time being creative rather than just spectating.",1315260538

337442,comment,337135,337135,0,0,keefe,,,"Here is my advice having struggled with scalability for the last two years, please take with a grain of salt... Regarding the previous discussion of EC2 etc - EC2 just gives you headless linux boxes that you can do with as you please. You have to configure the disks specially to gain persistence of data or use S3 or SimpleDB. There is a lot of  background knowledge of linux that is going on. For scalability, I would first concentrate on the engineering quality of your codebase. Get lots of tests and get them running nightly and automatically. Automation of tasks is your friend, so if you don't already know ant spend the 2 days it takes to learn it. To really scale well, you are going to need a cluster of machines - this means your app is going to be running in multiple address spaces so you will need to handle that issue - if you haven't already done so, look up memcached. I think you should focus on stability first, make sure your app can run ""forever"" - the two big blockers to you there are memory usage and concurrency issues. Memory usage means cleaning up after yourself and avoiding memory leaks, instrumentation and a profiler are your friends here. For concurrent issues, you should do a thorough study of thread management and make sure your locks are consistent. Once you have all these stability issues under control, I think it is about having good interfaces for key components of your code, identifying bottlenecks in performance (again, instrumentaiton) and then rewriting these bottlenecks. There is also the issue of making sure that you are transmitting the minimum amount of data required and strategies for scaling up. If you are doing work for the Navy, be prepared for fairly serious scrutiny of your security practices as well - security, like scalability, it much harder to tack on later. Last but not least, remember that premature optimization will kill your time.",1224464088

Maybe you could save more through other means, but they are all, in theory, net savers.<p>For example, on the home economics front, I'd advise that you buy pots and pans at Target so you can cook your own meals because you'll save $15/meal/person x 3 meals/day x 30 days/month x 4 persons/household = $5400/month/household, on average. Maybe you can save more by buying used pots at the thrift store, or inheriting them from your rich uncle, or salvaging them out of the garbage, but that doesn't invalidate the point.<p>Your question was glib, and this is a forum for smart people.",1224463883

Which would be fine if they are investing enough money to buy their stake, but if they aren't, then you need to make sure that they'll have a specific role in the company that they're willing to play, and that both you and the third founder feel is important.

337429,comment,334355,334355,0,0,fishonmars,,,"How could I forget. Setting up serve space and a database takes time and money too. And then there is setting up a credit card account so people can pay more easily on your site if you are taking money. Then there's the setting up of the business account at the bank and waiting for eons to get a Federal Tax ID number. I switched over my previous FTID
to my new site from my old site because my old site never launched (thank God) but banks do drag their feet in opening up a business credit card account which is needed to set up a merchant account with Amazon Simple Pay since I won't be allowing PayPal since eBay owns them and I'm competing with eBay. The biggest drawback of a startup is the lack of sleep but the biggest benefit is no commute time so you save a fortune in not driving much. 
So it's a lot more then merely writing code. You need shelter (a place to live) and money for food and rent and utilites and gasoline for the car. Then unexpected bills like speeding tickets, car registration, smog check, and car insurance it all adds up fast and at a frightening pace.
So I don't go insane I visit one of my brothers who's studying for his PhD in CS at UC Santa Cruz and I've promised him a job when he graduates. He thinks in C and Lisp and can write bug free code. He's not human. So I spend money keeping him well fed. So sacrifices need to be made.
And if your site grows you're going to need more
servers and more databases and they run on electricity not oxygen and that costs money. 
I would think it would be educational and a good thing for all universities to house startups on campus to study them and learn from them but I agree with PG that it's the founders, dedication, determination and not stubbornness.
There is a lot of uncertainty too. I just visualize the site working and it keeps me going. I watch videos of soldiers in Iraq fighting on YouTube and then I don't mind so much writing code. At least nobody is shooting at me when I'm writing code. And it's good to take breaks and relax sometimes because you need to unplug from the matrix so that
you have a life outside of your code.",1224462653

Many of these would qualify the person as handicapped and therefore a member of a protected class. If there's even a doubt, you might have to settle out to avoid legal fees or a potential defeat in court. Besides, reasonable accommodations are, by definition, reasonable. Maybe he/she can be one of the people that works odd hours to avoid others?<p><i>he's bringing down the team. Sucks to be him, but if he's affecting productivity, out he goes.</i><p>There was no mention of a productivity hit. We have to take the OP at his word that he/she meant, ""If somebody isn't suave or outgoing enough, fire that person."" I think I'd rather educate my team about diversity, tolerance, and respect than fire technically competent people who happen to like to keep their doors closed. If you have a team that requires all others to be social sophisticates and can't function in the face of shyness, then this is your second biggest problem after handling the inevitable discrimination suit for firing Joe Shy. Also, if I worked with me, I'd probably want some alone time, too.<p>There are just so many things wrong with point (9) that it's hard to get them all out. Here goes:<p>1) Team managers, unless highly skilled (and sometimes even then) don't always understand the factors that make their teams function/fail.<p>2) The aforementioned possible legal liability of insisting on a team of suaves.<p>3) The inadvisability of insisting on a team of suaves.<p>4) The presupposition that the person who is awkward/shy is the problem. Maybe (the hypothetical) you and your team are a gang of unproductive dicks?<p>5) Maybe you're productive dicks but it will never scale?<p>6) The whiny intolerance of anyone who's not having absolutely the easiest time of things.<p>7) The fact that none of this has ever been an issue on any team I've ever worked on?<p>8) The insipid notion that it's a zero sum game or that the only thing is the productivity or that you can improve productivity with misguided social engineering.<p>I could go on. I think that what it really comes down to is that I'd rather be the guy who succeeds by helping others succeed. Entrepreneurship is as much about finding value where others can't as it is about creating new value. That includes finding it in employees who are less than socially perfect.",1224462123

He didn't have enough money to get to the next level and do things that in fact were expensive, like get access to million dollar machines (once he went to college, he did get access to a mainframe, and ran up the bill so much he never went back until he started Apple, and only went back after Apple became a success.)<p>Therefore, I think a modern-day Steve from Silicon Valley would in fact have at least two monitors.

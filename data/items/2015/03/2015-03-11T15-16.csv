    - I love Renaissance Fairs
    - I used to (and still would enjoy) D&D and LARPing
    - I spent more time learning about programming and application security than I 
      spent doing anything else
    - I spent more time in high school learning how to wield a katana than I spent 
      thinking about boys
    - Despite being a 25 year-old gay furry, I&#x27;ve never been in a relationship. This
      might not seem that weird, but when you spend a lot of time in a fandom where
      polyamory and sex is rather pronounced, it makes me somewhat of an outsider to

9184613,comment,9179660,9179660,0,0,geebee,,,"I&#x27;m coming in late here, but I have experienced an open office environment that I found relatively productive.  This was at Sun Micro&#x27;s drop in center in SF (about 15 years ago now).<p>The drop in center had three separate rooms.  Two were loud rooms, with phones at each desk.  One was a smaller &quot;quiet room&quot;, with no phones, intended for people who do quiet, focused work.  I suppose there was some &quot;back visibility&quot;, since the workstations were set up on round (might have been hexagonal) tables, so it would have depended on where you sit.  Another big factor in the success of a quiet room was an office manager who absolutely enforced the noise rules, since a lot of people who would push the limits if allowed (when spaces in the loud rooms were all taken)<p>There were also a few offices/small conf rooms for meetings and so forth.<p>I think it worked, but that&#x27;s probably because it didn&#x27;t have the same goals of &quot;collaboration&quot; or &quot;openness&quot; that modern open office proponents often claim to provide.  Most importantly, the open office and quiet room was clearly not intended to keep an eye on workers in any way.  It was a drop in center in the first place, so while you might see the same people around, nobody was really monitoring anyone else.  Also, there was no status associated with where you sat - open seating, grab what you like.  And of course, the quiet room showed a great respect for people like developers who need extended periods of quiet focus.<p>It&#x27;s also clear that the &quot;open office&quot; quality of this drop in center wasn&#x27;t based on flawed notions of increased communication or collaboration.  At that time, developers at Sun had their own offices (well, I did, and I wasn&#x27;t high on the org chart), so the drop in center was for convenience.  It was set up so that people who had meetings in other spots, or who wanted to telecommute, had a place with a workstation if they needed it, and had a phone or a quiet room, depending on how they needed to work that day.  The idea that the office would be a place for constant open communication wasn&#x27;t part of the plan - in fact, the quiet room ensured that this sort of thing didn&#x27;t constantly distract the developers.<p>Kind of depressing, now that I think about it, that the only time in my life I had my own office was my first job.  The industry has really moved away from that model over the last 15 years.  Facebook has moved into the old sun offices… did they tear them all out and replace them with open offices?<p>I also had shared offices quite a few times, and I enjoyed those (actually, I liked them more than my own office in many ways, provided I shared with another developer).  Cubicles and open offices are pretty horrible, but I think that if we had a &quot;quiet room&quot; approach to them, they might not be so bad.",1426088263

Not any of the others. This is an absolutely vital distinction.<p>> . While yes, you could decide what cost you&#x27;re willing to pay for each channel, you will still arrive at a &quot;yes/no&quot; decision for each channel (a decision that will only get more generous the less expensive the cost of the individual channel)<p>Right, so if I&#x27;m willing to pay $17.50 for HBO, I&#x27;m obviously willing to pay $5 for HBO.

Nobody here is arguing that buying the same items at a higher price each is better value, they&#x27;re arguing that buying a subset of them at a higher price each can be better value overall.<p>This should be obvious if we split out the two channels like so:<p>Package A: Two channels at $17.50 each<p>Package B: Eighteen channels at $1.67 each<p>If I don&#x27;t value the channels in B enough, it is more economical to me to only buy package A rather than package A <i>and</i> package B.",1426088094

9184510,comment,9178765,9183531,0,0,amyjess,,,"> IMO the biggest tragedy is Mozilla&#x27;s unwillingness to put other languages in the browser. Dart was developed in public, far more of an open standard than the original JS, fixed language design problems that ES6 still isn&#x27;t addressing, had an adequate approach to running in JS-only browsers, and would have added much less complexity to browser implementation (the reason given for rejection) than many standards that Mozilla has been happy to support.<p>It&#x27;s also Google&#x27;s failure to exploit their market position. Instead of using Dartium, they should&#x27;ve just integrated the Dart VM into mainline Chrome and began paying web developers to use Dart. Mozilla would then have no choice but to implement Dart or find their users complaining about not being able to access their favorite websites.<p>On a similar note, it&#x27;s kind of a shame that IE&#x27;s support for VBScript never took off. Not because VBScript was a good language, but because it would&#x27;ve laid down a precedent for the web being a multi-language environment. Browser vendors would have developed pluggable scripting architectures to compete. Imagine if, say, every browser on Windows could have allow scripts written in, for example, everything offered by Windows Script Host (and I&#x27;m sure some equivalent architecture would have been developed for Mac and Linux -- maybe even something as simple as &quot;any script that can be interpreted via a shebang line&quot;).",1426087255

The deck was the first time I had heard of a major company having a &quot;no vacation tracking&quot; policy. It was presented in the same context as the HR manual. The policy of having no policies is built on employee trust. Employee trust is built on the standard of only hiring top quality employees.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked for Netflix or any other company willing to make such bold statements so can&#x27;t speak to the reality.

9184474,comment,9184149,9184149,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Not an astroturfer or an apologist here. I&#x27;ve never had any employment connection with NSA or any other intelligence agency of any government. I&#x27;m a United States citizen who has spent six years of my adult life living outside the United States. I&#x27;ll agree with a previous lower-level comment here that it is possible to publicly protest NSA abuses (as I did, with my whole family, in view of news media cameras and police officers in downtown Minneapolis on the Restore the Fourth protest evening in 2013) while still thinking that the United States must, in an imperfect world, have a national signals intelligence agency with powerful tools. Individual computer users--all over the world--ought to have access to powerful tools to ensure private communications and to prevent black-hat hacking of their data or their computers, but I&#x27;m also happy for governments to be informed (within strict legal limits) about what&#x27;s going on in the rest of the world, because that kind of background knowledge actually builds trust and realistic levels of doubt, and helps prevent hasty decisions to go to war or to promote state-sponsored terrorism. The world system has been more stable and less lethal to the common people of the world with strong national intelligence agencies (especially strong national intelligence agencies operated by democratic governments) than it was with weak intelligence capabilities that let countries surprise their adversaries more often.<p>Anticipating a comment that comes up in threads like this most of the time on Hacker News, I will mention why I am not overly afraid of NSA controlling the whole country by blackmailing politicians. I don&#x27;t believe NSA blackmail can or will happen in general, for reasons I have mentioned before here on HN. One of the most common kinds of comments here on Hacker News about issues like this is a comment that ASSUMES that if government leaders are under pervasive surveillance they are all afraid of blackmail. But I don&#x27;t believe that, because some government leaders and some political candidates are essentially shameless. Even after they are caught (by old-fashioned journalism, or by a jilted lover or some unrelated criminal investigation) doing something unsavory, they are still willing to run for office, and SOME ARE REELECTED. United States Senator David Vitter was reelected in 2010 even after a scandal involving behavior that I would consider shameful,[1] and the antics of former DC mayor Marion Barry[2] are probably still notorious enough that they don&#x27;t need further discussion here. In short, I call baloney on the idea that NSA can keep politicians on its leash simply by knowing their secrets. Some politicians have PUBLIC lives full of dirt, and still get elected and influence policy anyway.<p>The other reason I don&#x27;t believe this HN hivemind theory of politics is that I by no means assume that everyone in politics lacks personal integrity. Some politicians, I am quite sure, could have all their secrets revealed only to have voters think &quot;Why is that person such a straight-arrow? Why not have some fun once in a while?&quot; The simple fact is that there is value system diversity in the United States electorate, and there is personal conduct probity variance among United States politicians, and there isn&#x27;t any universal way to unduly influence politicians merely through even the most diligent efforts to discover personal secrets. If politicians think that NSA is going too far (as evidently several politicians from more than one party do think), then they will receive plenty of support from the general public to rein in the surveillance. (Obligatory disclaimer: Yes, I am a lawyer, who as a judicial clerk for my state&#x27;s Supreme Court used to review case files on attorney misconduct, and, yes, some of my law school classmates are elected officials, including one member of Congress. I am absolutely certain that there are enough politicians ready to mobilize to roll back NSA surveillance programs if they really think the programs are excessive in their scope.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vitter#D.C._Madam_scandal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vitter#D.C._Madam_scanda...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry#1990_arrest_and_drug_conviction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry#1990_arrest_and_d...</a>",1426086848

So if you&#x27;ve stored 1000 GB, you can only access 1.7 GB per day for free.<p>The cost for going over your daily &quot;retrieval allowance&quot; can be large, because cost is driven by &quot;peak retrieval rate&quot;. They find the highest hourly retrieval rate over the entire month, and charge the whole month&#x27;s retrieval at the peak rate.<p>This can get expensive fast. Again, with 1000 GB stored, if you retrieve 200 GB over the course of 4 hours, your hourly retrieval rate is 200 GB / 4 hours = 50 GB per hour. Your free retrieval allowance is 1.7 GB per day / 24 hours = 0.07 GB / hour. So your excess retrieval is 49.93 GB per hour.<p>Amazingly, that 49.93 GB per hour for 4 hours is charged for all 720 hours in the month, so that&#x27;s 49.93 * 720 * 0.01 = $359.49.<p>That&#x27;s an astonishing $1.79 per GB just to retrieve one-fifth of the data from Glacier storage.<p>So Glacier only makes sense for true cold storage, where you are very unlikely to touch more than 0.00007 of it in any given hour.<p>Google&#x27;s Nearline is much simpler and faster for the same storage cost -- and far cheaper if you need to access more than a tiny fraction of the data.<p>Source: <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/#How_much_data_can_I_retrieve_for_free"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/#How_much_data_can_I_retr...</a>",1426086792

Unfortunately monetary policy is far too slow to see it yet.<p>The concept of a positive inflation rate is a noble one, but unachievable. This is because, imho, it is just a high level way to reach for what is actually an unattainable goal, which is control over spending habits.<p>On the outset, a policy maker realizes a &#x27;simple solution&#x27; is to increase spending when a recession or pullback arises. If they can force everyone to spend, then recessions obviously cannot happen. On its face, we all can see immediately that this can&#x27;t work; if you reach into peoples&#x27; pockets and force their money on the table there will be knock off effects on other discretionary spending habits; besides that it is politically distasteful as well.<p>So some bright policy maker realized, well, if we can&#x27;t force them to do it, how about we apply more carrot and less stick instead. Then we can achieve the impossible without the use of force. This creates a false environment where people feel they have control, but really they are doing just what policy makers asked. It can be done through inflation targeting.<p>Viewed through this lens, the rest of what happened should begin to come clear. It reached the desired goal immediately, and the unattainable was suddenly possible!  That is until the knock off effects are piled so high and so deep that the whole thing craters, only now it is much worse.<p>It is a bit like forest fires. At first blush it is obvious to anyone that the fires cause the damage. Stop the fires, and stop the damage. So we tried this for years with Smokey the Bear, fire lines, and other measures with success. Eventually fires became less frequent, but highly destructive events. After years passed someone realized that controlled burns were probably a smarter idea. At some point it should become clear that it is probably not necessary due to the considerable expense and effort to create controlled burns. Maybe we should just let them unfold naturally, with minimal interference where needed, and just move people and property away from the areas of danger.<p>Just like in the case of forest fires, inflationary targets won&#x27;t be recognized as the menace they are until we are all forced to suffer from it.

It&#x27;s not primarily the number of characters we&#x27;re optimizing for but code as information dense and devoid of redundancies as possible.<p>I actually think you should be verbose to the point of building a DSL-like syntax for your solution to improve readability. Even for instance addint small properties and methods that simplifies reading. It&#x27;s much easier to read<p><pre><code>  if (CanWrite && WillFitDisk)

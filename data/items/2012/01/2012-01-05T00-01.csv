1. Hackers, and the kind people who really care about this kind of thing want to have the best; if someone says it isn't the best, even implicitly by saying that they prefer a competitor, we get defensive.<p>2. What companies you choose can be seen as a single pieve of what some perceive as an ideological struggle. Google the defender of openness, and Apple the harsh dictator, managing user experience with an iron fist.<p>3. People have their phones nearby nearly 24/7. It's possible a subconscious attachment to it develops in people, though I don't know the psychology of it.",1325725123
3426768,comment,3424693,3425235,2,0,ctchocula,,,"Having read ""Down and Out in Paris and London"" recently, I didn't notice anything too appalling. Just some stereotypical views of Jews, which I thought Orwell wrote with the purpose of describing a typical Brit from the early 20th century in order to criticize their antisemitism, but some googling suggests he expresses similar views in his diaries too, which is a bit more disconcerting.<p>> One could ignore this, just possibly, if it existed in a single book. And yet for 10 years the abstract figure of ""the Jew"" makes regular appearances in Orwell's diaries. Out tramping in the early 30s, he falls in with ""a little Liverpool Jew, a thorough guttersnipe"" with a face that recalls ""some low-down carrion bird"". Watching the crowds thronging the London underground in October 1940, he decides that what is ""bad"" about the Jews is that they are not only conspicuous but go out of their way to make themselves so.<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/aug/13/biography.highereducation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/aug/13/biography.higher...</a>",1325725120

If you wanted to look at one particular event, several years ago a major Nazi site ranked #1 for [Jew], because the people who care about [Jew] and were early adopters on the Internet happened to be Nazis.  Google, at the time, refused to hand-edit that, and instead put PSA AdWords ads against the SERP for [Jew] saying ""While we're certainly not Nazis, the algorithm decrees that the most relevant result for this search is, regrettably, a Nazi site.""

3426762,comment,3426606,3426606,1,0,pwg,,,"I suspect the true reason is expense based, with a bit of old habit thrown in for good measure.  Most tanks are oddly shaped (to fit the confines of the space into which they fit) which means that they empty non-linearly.  Most fuel sensors are a float on a pivot arm, which means the sensor also operates non-linearly.  While it is quite technically feasible to compensate for both non-linear functions and produce a gauge that reads to the exact tenth, or hundredth, of a gallon/liter remaining in the tank, doing so would add extra expense.  And while the expense per car might be small (a few dollars more per car), over the course of a years production run, a few dollars per car times several hundred thousand cars, makes the sum total a very large amount.<p>Plus, the vast majority of drivers very likely only really care about ""when do I need to add gas"" and we have a simple gauge marked in quarter increments, or a set of 6 or 8 bars that slowly disappear.",1325725023

They include more complete information than online versions.<p>3) Never, ever pay for a copy of your credit report. If you just want a copy every few months, it's easy. There are many reasons by law the agencies have to give you a copy for free. You're looking for a job. You didn't qualify for a better interest rate. You were denied credit. Etc. They don't police it. For example, go to equifax.com/fcra right now, you can fill out the form and have an online copy for free in just a couple minutes. Just say you're looking for a job, it'll work fine. As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing morally dubious about this: This is YOUR credit report.<p>4) Don't ever pay for a ""score"" from them. In nearly every case, they will not be a real Fico score anyway. They will be the agencies proprietary, useless score. Lenders use fico. If you want to know your fico, you can purchase it from MyFico.com. There are usually promo codes if you look around.<p>Certain store credit cards offered by GE Money Bank (like the Walmart card, and others like IIRC Lowes, Kohls, etc) offer a free monthly Fico score on their account management website.<p>One final note abotu Fico: Experian does not allow you to buy a Fico. It's totally lame. You can buy a fico via MyFico for TransUnion and Equifax, though. If you want to know your Experian score, there's a couple credit unions that offer it to their members, otherwise your best bet is to ask the loan officer next time you're getting a car or mortgage.<p>And be advised that there are MANY different fico scores: Fico has tweaked the formula several times, and they still sell various older versions of it, and they sell special ""enhanced"" versions -- so a mortgage lender can buy a ""Mortgage Enhanced"" fico that places more weight on your installment loan history, for example. All of this means that the score you can buy on MyFico has only a relation to the one a lender would see when they run your credit.",1325723625

These generated games tested by humans and they found that the aesthetics criteria and human judgements correlated significantly.<p>Besides these criteria (they do not describe all criteria in depth but I assume some might be leaning towards being subjective in regards to the programmers preferences) they also add a restriction to how long the planning of a move for a game can take (15 seconds) and discarding the game if it surpasses this.

Learning to think that way, however, is not just another skill in an infinite toolbox of possible skills, all of which are equal and each of which you can be proud of in a touchy-feely way. Learning to think, and talk, and <i>conceive in advance what you'll do next</i> that way is akin to learning the art of war. The adaptation to programming is pretty minor. Programming is mickey mouse lawyering. The beauty of law is that someone's actually right; there's a logic at work, and teasing out the convoluted threads is your job. I can dig it.

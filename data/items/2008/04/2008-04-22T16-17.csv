The competitors may not be able to release as early or often. Everything might fall through for them. Or, maybe, they'll be successful, and you'll be successful, because there's room in the market for more than one company.<p>You shouldn't be afraid of competition, you should embrace it as an opportunity to be challenged to produce an even better product than you would have.<p>So, I say just focus on your product. Make it the best, most mold-shattering product you can. If you can do that, and keep on doing that, then at the very least your potential competitors are going to have to spend a lot of energy just trying to keep up with you.",1208883520

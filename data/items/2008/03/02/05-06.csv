The other two I'm pretty sure I could pull some strings and get in touch with (off the top of my head, they're each a friend of a friend of a friend), but I'm not about to waste their time for the sake of a social experiment.",1204436818

He's suggesting like a ""digg"" or ""reddit"" on behalf of those people, ie, ""the public"" reads your suggested email and vote up those they think is worth it for you as the ""famous"" person to read.",1204436622

I'm thinking perhaps he meant like if you wanted to get in touch with Bill Gates or Larry Page or Steve Jobs or something like that.  That's a tad bit different.",1204436340

127171,comment,127121,127139,0,0,NSX2,,,"I think he's saying it's like an organically-derived algorithm that meets halfway between ""I don't know you so I'm skeptical of your value"" and ""I may be skeptical but if this many people think it's worthwile, perhaps I'll take a look.""<p>I don't know what famous people you're talking about ... I'm assuming we're leaving out ""celebrities"" and concentrating on ""useful"" famous people in business/academia?  If so, you'd be surprised at how much correspondence they can have.<p>Not to mention I'm not sure if you realize how many of the ""emails"" on things like VC pages are bogus on purpose.  Like when they say, ""mail your business plans attention ""Business Plan Manager"" ... that's usually code for ""just toss this in the paper shredder.<p>Here: test this out.  Think of 5 famous people and email them something you think surely would catch their attention.  See if you can find their real emails and if they bother reading it.  Use one of those ""verification of opened email"" services.<p>It just doesn't happen that often.  If anything it gets sent to an assistant who sends it to another assistant who sends it to the intern who gives it to his little sister who gives it to the cat.<p>I think this would be a good ""idea"" if not necessarily one that translates into a business.",1204435537
127170,comment,126809,126888,0,0,Darmani,,,"Unfortunately, so far I've seen just the opposite. Other than this one, the comments on most of the polls I've seen (both here and elsewhere, now that I think about it) have just been the poster stating what choice he chose with little else. Even the poll on ""When do you upvote an article,"" which I expected to be very promising discussion-wise, has little going for it after 8 hours.<p>I think this is a result of the fact that names are no longer associated with votes with the explicit polling system. In more frank terms, people no longer get their burst of vanity from ""voting,"" and thus many replace it by shouting their vote out loud. In previous polls, many would post a more complex response to the prompt in their own words, along with a few thoughts. While we'd get plenty of the '""a,"" ""b,"" ""me too""' comments (glad I'm not the only one to detest those), they'd at least be at the bottom of an interesting thread rather than the top of a shoutfest.",1204435417

127167,comment,126746,126789,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"That's a lot of fancy words for trying to say their products don't look like Google Docs. But I think that's just you overestimating the simplicity of Google Docs and underestimating how dominating Microsoft Office is in the American business landscape.<p>In the US go apply for an job, an actual job, in a small office and they'll ask you three things: can you type? in Word? when can you start?<p>They've printed hundreds of books to teach you how to use Office. The main interface of office has stayed relatively the same from 1994, 1998, 2000, 2004, XP and it is by far the standard in small to medium businesses and enterprise. This isn't about style, it's about utility and functionality that people recognize.<p>And this SaaS strategy is even more fundamentally important because they can now finally achieve their BackOffice dreams started in the 90's. Complete service backend (SQL, Exchange, systems management, ISA, IIS) to power Excel, Acess, and Outlook and charge you globs of money each month for it.",1204435121

127165,comment,127025,127161,0,0,robg,,,"If you think that's amazing, read about the U.S. farm bill and how it affects farmers around the world. More disquieting is how it affects the U.S. food supply (and as a consequence, our health). There's a reason a Twinkie (or a cheeseburger) is cheaper than an orange (or a salad). Uncle Sam subsidizes the former (sugar and beef respectively) much more. People (like me) are starting to wake up though with the help of popular books, like from Michael Pollan (all excellent). For the first time in a long time this year the farm bill saw some Congressional debate and for good reason. Why pay out millions to treat obesity and diabetes when cheaper food choices are a primary culprit?",1204434790

Personally, what ruined reddit for me was Ron Paul, politics, and all the 911wasAnInsideJob folks.  I could even live with the over-abundance of LOL cats and flicker links.  But the overall nuttiness of the site simply turned me off.<p>Don't get me wrong, I like politics and I personally think Ron Paul has a lot going for him.  But I didn't start reading the site for its political bent; I started reading it for the interesting links and the tech stuff.  I'd simply like to get my political news elsewhere.  With the bastardized reddit, I couldn't get away from politics, even with the introduction of sub-reddits.",1204434279

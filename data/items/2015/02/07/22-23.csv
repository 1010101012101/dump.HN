But that still isn&#x27;t engineering. They haven&#x27;t clearly and thoroughly documented the system so that anyone else can step in and replace them if need-be. They aren&#x27;t capable of measuring their progress since it&#x27;s going to be an unknown guestimation (which phase of the project are you in currently and how long until this phase is completed and we can move onto the next phase?). A massive requirements change might throw this type of individual off and lead to a mental wall since the new requirements don&#x27;t fit into their mental model of the system. And most importantly, their process is not well defined nor repeatable to the extent they could follow the exact same steps on new projects and predicably produce results.",1423349961

It has been worse with that fact that we also work with outside freelancers.<p>I am trying to step up a bit and fix those things I can. Few things on my mind are: coding guidelines (best practices), PEP-8, code review, writing extensive tests, setting up CI server. (Please feel free to suggest more.)<p>Now all of these things will take some extra time, particularly writing tests. People in management are not technical, and they don&#x27;t care as far as things are working.

4966092,comment,4964355,4965887,6,0,Joeri,,,"Volume is not profit. Intel is an order of magnitude more profitable. However, ARM's model seems to be to suck the profit out of the market. It's a textbook example of a paradigm shift, with an initially inferior product offered at a much lower price point gradually catching up with the market leader. Intel has no choice but to follow ARM down the price curve to settle at a lower profit margin. They seem to have realized this with their current chip strategy. I would be looking at intel to start diversifying into the device market, because that's where the profit is moving.",1356447394
4966091,comment,4965868,4966064,3,0,lotsofpulp,,,"This is because of momentum.  The online travel websites have  established themselves among a portion of the population.  As a result, in competitive regions, hotels have to play the third party travel website game, which means offering their rooms cheaper there, otherwise their competitors will get that business if they choose not to offer it.   However, as I noted below, if you call directly, and offer to pay the hotel directly 5% less than what Expedia or whoever is offering you a room, they should take the money, unless they are incompetent.  I would ask to speak to a manager if the lowly desk clerk doesn't accomodate.<p>The larger hotel franchises are combating this with www.roomkey.com, which is a direct link to the hotel.<p>As for credit cards, all major hotels (Choice/IHG/Wyndham/Hilton/Accor) have systems that comply with credit card standards.  Credit card numbers should not, and I have never seen them, printed plainly on any piece of paper.  They are not even visible to most employees, only managers, if proper procedures are followed.  They are forwarded to hotels as a security deposit because sometimes the third party websites are not paying, the guest is, and the hotel then pays the travel agent.  In this case, the hotel needs the guest's card info to authorize the card after the cancellation period has expired, so that the hotel has a guarantee of being able to collect the money.<p>>I tried, and the link is down. Most of the hotels don't even have websites, let alone online reservations. There is a reason customers go to expedia in the first place.<p>In America, most hotels certainly do have websites, via their franchise.  If they don't, I'd advise looking up their phone number (google, tripadvisor), and calling them.",1356447330

Only, when they break, people tend to notice, and those people tend to spread word around pretty quickly.<p>When I worked at a hosting company, we'd have at least 5 shared hosting servers (with ~75-200 websites on each) go down each day, and yet we had a reputation for good uptime, because comparatively, we DID have good uptime.<p>I think the problem is that most people think about uptime wrong. Uptime is a compromise; a trade-off. You can pay for more uptime with diminishing returns after about 98%. Running one dedicated server colo'd with decent fault recovery systems in a decent datacenter will probably get you 100% uptime most of the time, until it doesn't, thus ~98%.<p>If you're going to attempt to get beyond power failures, you'll need a second server (or ""instance"") somewhere. If you need the capacity anyway, this might not double your costs, but you may still have unused headroom. You could buy flexible computing power by using shared hosting (""the cloud"") or whatever, but it's the same problem.<p>Once you get into a state where you have a global business, customer demands, supplier issues, vendor lock-in, etc, it becomes a numbers game. You can hire (more|better|famous) devs and possibly get more uptime. You can test more (and slow down feature releases) to get better uptime. You can break stuff (and pay for the recovery + lost face + downtime) to decrease downtime. Everything is a trade-off, and right now it makes sense to chase about ""four nines"" of uptime -- 99.99%.<p>Four nines is 4.32 minutes per month -- four minutes and nineteen seconds AT MOST once a month. This is very possible for many large services and while it does have cost overhead, it's manageable.<p>TL;DR don't go chasing waterfalls (100% uptime.) It's not practical. It may be possible, but it depends on how long. 100% uptime for 10 years would be a pretty damn lofty goal. In my opinion, it's much more important to recover quickly and gracefully with awesome communication with your customers than it is to be up 100% of the time. 100% uptime goes unnoticed, but consistently great customer service does not.",1356446969

4966070,comment,4965868,4965868,10,0,lotsofpulp,,,"I know people in the hospitality business, and all third party travel websites (and travel agents) are bad for the traveler and hotel, for a few simple reasons.<p>1) Middlemen always need their cut.  In this case, you pay the website, and then the website pays the hotel less.<p>2) By bypassing the middleman (call the hotel directly, and speak to that specific location's on site employees), you SHOULD be able to get a better deal.  Simply compare prices, and if you find it cheaper on a website, ask the hotel to give you 5% off.  Any competent manager will do this because it costs much more than 5% to get your reservation from a travel agent.  Obviously, they will have to verify that third party price, but in the case of Expedia, they can just search it.<p>3) Additionally, it's good to book directly with the hotel for the following reasons too (or at least call them directly after booking online to confirm):<p>-In the fine print of travel websites' T&C, it will say you are guaranteed A room, not THE room you want.  This means if only smoking rooms are available, the third party site will still sell it to you as a non smoking room.  Also, there are many incompatibilities in the GDS/Central reservation system software, so there is a chance there can be an error in your reservation.<p>-Third party reservations don't go to the hotel with the guest's contact information.  This means if the hotel wants to contact you about some issue, they cannot reach you, and the websites won't give out the guest's information.  This was a big problem during Sandy a few months ago.<p>All in all, third party websites are a relic of the times when hotels did not have the technical expertise to implement internet reservation systems.  Nowadays, you can just look up the hotel's reviews on TripAdvisor, call the hotel directly, and make sure you get the room you want by speaking with someone directly at the property, with actual knowledge of the place.  The ONLY benefit these third party websites can provide, seems to be with the bundling of hotels/flights/rental cars, but I still wouldn't use them.  Going straight to the vendor has been the more pleasant experience for me.<p>Edit:  I should have noted that my knowledge comes from US and British hotels, mostly franchises like IHG/Hilton/Choice/Wyndham.",1356446704

Expedia, or any other travel site, always had better deals. In fact, I once called the hotel in question to ask why there is a big price discrepancy between their site listing and makemytrip. I was concerned makemytrip is selling me rooms that doesn't exist and the hotel won't honor my reservation. The hotel staff told me the hotel sells rooms to makemytrip well in advance, and whatever the price that is listed on makemytrip will be honored(doesn't really matter; you pay directly to makemytrip).<p>Also, I am a bit paranoid. I would hate it if some hotel overbooked and told me ""lol sorry"" when I arrive. I know travel sites aren't really on my side, but at least I will have someone to appeal to.<p>I didn't have any bad experience with Expedia but then, I had very limited interactions with them(I didn't even modify or cancel my bookings).<p>I would advice against agoda and booking.com as they forward your credit card info to the hotel as <i>security.</i> In what world does forwarding a customer's credit card info to a random hotel makes sense? Imagine the surprise when you are at the hotel counter and the staff shows you a printout of your credit card info(nothing obscured; everything in plain text).<p>> If you would like to know more about our hotel just visit our website at www.lunabluehotel.com.<p>I tried, and the link is down.

That growth will not be on iOS because apple doesn't do low-budget.<p>That growth will be mostly on android, but there's plenty of opportunity for it to be on windows phone as well. Microsoft has made some smart moves here. They've used windows 8 as a foot in the door to get people used to metro. The pc market may be shrinking, but there are still a billion pc's out there which will gradually be replaced with windows 8.

Obviously a stimulus of $100 will be ineffective, but you can draw no conclusion about ""often"" (or ""rarely"") from what I wrote.<p>> Sticky wages increase risk of having your wage cut to $0.<p>Based on the research I did yesterday, and described in <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4963624"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4963624</a> , ""In a baseline New Keynesian model, labor market frictions render real wage rigidity potentially irrelevant for the dynamics of inflation."" and ""The mechanism emphasized by Hall (2005) and Shimer (2005) that helps the search and matching model fit the facts, appears to have a neutralizing effect in sticky price models.""<p>The search and matching model is the one I hand-waved here. Inflation isn't the same as unemployment, so this quote isn't directly transferable. But it seems that wage stickiness or lack thereof doesn't have as much effect on the economy. Instead, it increases the volatility of hiring and job creation costs.<p>I referenced the paper of Krausea and Lubikb, <a href=""http://www.tau.ac.il/~yashiv/kl_jme2007.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tau.ac.il/~yashiv/kl_jme2007.pdf</a> . It includes a term for what I've been saying is a cultural morality to have sticky wages. ""We employ a version of Halls (2005) notion of a wage norm to introduce real wage rigidity. A wage norm may arise from social convention that constrains wage adjustment for existing and newly hired workers.""<p>> employees choose to spend the money on consumer goods rather than mitigating their risk<p>Because people don't make fully rational economic decisions. You might as well ask why so many people smoke, even with the knowledge of how it affects their health, or ask why I've stopped exercising despite knowing its positive benefits. Why did the banks make so many subprime mortgages? Why did so many people agree to them even with high chances of not being able to pay?<p>If you want, I think you can model things like ""I <i>really</i> wanted a new computer"" as a random external event akin to an unexpected medical problem or broken plumbing, and bring the analysis back into the rational hypothesis.<p>> To determine ""market power"" in any model I've seen, ...<p>Really? The Krausea and Lubikb paper says ""The parameters describing the household are standard. We choose a coefficient of relative risk aversion  = 2."" A constant relative risk aversion implies a decreasing absolute risk aversion, so the more money one has the more willing one is to take risks.<p>This makes it sound like many economic models - or at least those based on the search and matching model - include risk taking as part of the analysis. Can you square my observation with your statement? Perhaps it's because their model isn't used to determine market power per se?<p>> your point about transaction costs does show that there is wiggle room<p>I'm afraid I've lost the point of this thread. I say that employment can be viewed as a monopoly, and more importantly, that an employer can abuse those monopoly powers. And yes, an employee, and especially a union of employees, can be viewed as a monopoly and also abuse its monopoly powers.<p>You do not believe this is the correct analysis, and you believe that the various economic models back you up.<p>Do these quotes help show that economist have considered my hand-waving models in much more depth?<p>- There are search-and-matching frictions in every sector and firms post vacancies in order to attract workers. The cost of posting vacancies and the matching process generate hiring costs. Moreover, search-and-matching frictions generate bilateral monopoly power between a worker and his firm, as a result of which they engage in wage bargaining. -- <a href=""http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/77/3/1100.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/77/3/1100.full</a><p>- A specific class of models argues that wage rigidity might arise in the context of risk- averse workers and risk-neutral firms. In a seminal contribution, Thomas and Worrall (1988) develop a model with self-enforcing wage contracts whereby risk-neutral firms provide insurance to risk-averse workers. In their model agents cannot commit, but contacts are nevertheless self-enforcing due to an extreme reputation assumption, ac- cording to which an agent who reneges on a contract is forced to trade on the spot market forever after. Efficient contracts are contained in a certain interval and when- ever the wage leaves this interval, the agents update the wage by the smallest possible change that puts the wage back into the interval (i.e., on the bounds of the interval). Rudanko (2009) embeds this kind of model into an equilibrium model of directed search with aggregate shocks. In her model a constant wage emerges if both agents can fully commit, in which case the risk-neutral firms provide insurance to risk averse workers through optimal long-term wage contracting. In contrast to Hall (2005), her micro- founded model of perfect wage rigidity does not lead to a substantial increase in the cyclical volatility of unemployment. -- <a href=""http://www.econ.upf.edu/eng/graduates/gpem/jm/pdf/paper/Paper%201%20Cajner.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econ.upf.edu/eng/graduates/gpem/jm/pdf/paper/Pape...</a><p>The description model of Rudanko sounds like your statement - that wage rigidity leads to increased unemployment during recessions - isn't necessarily true.<p>Quoting from her site at <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/leenarudanko/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/leenarudanko/</a> : In this paper I develop a tractable extension of a Mortensen-Pissarides style matching model that allows for risk averse workers with limited ability to smooth consumption. I show that this leads to a form of equilibrium wage rigidity. This rigidity arises because the inability of workers to smooth their consumption across unemployment and employment spells changes how unemployed workers value wage offers, and hence also the offers that employers find profitable to make.<p>Aren't these quotes in opposition to what you've been describing, and more in line with the ideas I've described here?<p>That's not saying that the model is right, or that I'm right, only that there are economic models which agree with my views, so my views are not outright rejected by economic theory, while you think they are.",1356444585

The author had set the expected value of 2 at a given time period, which is to say the author assumes that the 'natural rate' of a mass shooting murder is 2 a year.<p>The mean across the years has got nothing to do with this IMO. It may have been a good rule of thumb to compare against, but it's not a good one to do an analysis upon. It leads to all sorts of mistaken conclusions, like the one the author made.",1356444215

Fire the people who were involved).",1356444086

If I have a function that deals with local files in a monad that's an instance of MonadHandle, I can write an instance for a RemoteIO type that performs file operations on a remote system through a network connection, and suddenly the function that was local also works remotely.",1356444005

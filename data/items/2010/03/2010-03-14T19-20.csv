My favorite metaphor for functional programming is Unix pipes:<p>cat file | grep XYZ | sort -r -n | ...<p>There's no explicit state but you can track the flow... output a file, search for something, sort that result, pipe it somewhere else, etc.<p>Imperative/state-based programming forces you to give names to all those intermediate results, just so you can pass them along. Sometimes variables are just a place to hold data until you can pass them to the next function; functional programming makes that so easy you don't need the variable. And think about how much easier it is to debug; once you get a part of the pipeline working, you can move to the next part (without worrying about global variables and other hidden interactions that can happen with imperative programming).",1268596203

I recall with chagrin the first startup I joined. The CEO was a friend of mine. I kept asking him how much equity he was offering as a percentage. He kept responding evasively by snowing me with all sorts of dealy jargon that I didn't understand. In retrospect, of course, he was concealing the fact that the percentage was negligible. At the time, though, insecure in my knowledge of business, I walked away thinking that I was a pathetic noob for having the idea that percentage was a meaningful metric. (This guy was good at what he did, which was deceive smart but gullible people.) That experience is one reason I like your job post. I totally agree with the commenter who said that they hate the jockeying of the negotiation process and would find it a relief to just know up front.<p>Anyway, I find your post to be an interesting experiment and I think many of us would like to see a follow-up report on it someday.",1268594434

Where 90% of businesses are Small to Medium Enterprises and are slowly coming to terms with technology. The number of businesses with broadband connectivity are increasing making it more pervasive than ever.<p>About 50% of those SME's do trading/retail and wholesale of goods. Goods need to be reordered from suppliers. They most of the time do ordering via phone or email. Phone calls are forgotten, emails get lost. The two solutions offer very little ways to keep track of orders. While sales/Inventory systems are in place, they don't usually have supplier collaboration features.<p>Im asking this question in the perspective of the Philippines. Just try to imagine the situation. The startup I am thinking of involves a product that potentially addresses the issue. It's a web-based sales/purchasing system that organizes the way suppliers communicate with customers and vice versa. Think of it as a social network however built for Business to Business transactions. In essence, it allows the two entities to transact, to make orders to suppliers, and for suppliers to send invoices to customers. Through the system, both entities can track receivables/payables.<p>It's going to have a basic CRM module where customers can submit issues on their products. It'll also have a project-management module for project-based deals where customers and suppliers can track milestones and billing schedules.<p>At this point it's still a rough idea.

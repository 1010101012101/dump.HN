A single language paradigm for client and server is big... the exact same language/structure/models for client and server communications and validation is pretty big.  Many client-side tools utilize node.js these days as well.<p>In general node.js combined with npm bring a lot less friction to development than other languages.   Using node to create shim services for a front end communicating through to different backands is brain dead simple as well.  In fact there&#x27;s been a few times that creating a service in node.js to communicate with an ill-defined backend was so much easier in node compared to the static language the main application was working in it was a no brainer.<p>Utility scripts in JS can also be pretty useful.. any kind of stream manipulations work well in node.js too.<p>This doesn&#x27;t even mention that JSON (current data transmission structure du jour) is native to the environment.  And storage systems like MongoDB (couch, rethinkdb and others) is really transparent to node.<p>I couldn&#x27;t even begin to all list the advantages, but here are a few..  the event loop system, libuv library bindings internal to node.js, language singularity, the npm system and over 40k modules...",1387190825

To the best of my knowledge, the article reads as an honest and true account of security service culture of integrity and professionalism. Kudos to him, and kudos to his colleagues as well for their restraint and their service.<p>I am pleased to see him hint at the exposure and vulnerability of the general public to surveillance by third parties, when he describes of the ongoing battle to dominate electronic systems, being waged by various nation-states and criminal gangs around the world. (I refuse to use that horribly juvenile construction &quot;cyber-war&quot;).<p>However, we still have some way to go before we fully confront the magnitude of the problem, and are able to formulate a sensible and coherent response.<p>Our military forces and security services are rightly part of our response to this vulnerability, but they cannot be the only tool that we deploy. Societies that lean to heavily on their armed forces and security services quickly feel the negative effects of their reliance, no matter how well-intentioned, well-disciplined and professional the servicemen and servicewomen may be.<p>Civil society needs to step up to the plate also. The problem is difficult, and the response needs to be multifaceted and broad. As engineers, we need to make our systems more secure and more trustworthy - and we need to make tools for the creation of secure and trustworthy systems ubiquitous.<p>For example, I am writing software for advanced driver assistance systems & autonomous vehicles -- I need to think very very carefully about how I can make my software secure and robust from attack; I need to educate my colleagues about the risky environment that we will be operating in, and together, we need to come up with standards and processes to help us ensure that the software we create minimises the risk posed by malicious actors.",1387190772

Those are written into law through executive, legislative, and judicial processes, and the three should theoretically balance each other out, which the public currently deems as not doing a sufficient job of balancing.  The NSA acts as an instrument -- the employees (to include the director) are directed through a system of reporting and feedback, and determine how best to act in order to obtain more positive feedback from customers of the reports.<p>This isn&#x27;t some theoretical system I&#x27;m talking about -- it&#x27;s a database of reporting with attached feedback.  The feedback shows who consumed the report, whether or not the party found it useful, any enclosed comments about the report, and how high up the report went.  If my report made it into the president&#x27;s daily brief and more information about the reporting subject is desired, that will show up in the feedback, and thus I have my &quot;direction&quot;.<p>How does this translate into real world operations?

I&#x27;ve been a pretty big fan of the language for a long time.  Well before Crockford&#x27;s good parts book.  And well before modern browsers.  I remember the v4 browser days, and how painful DOM interaction was.<p>I&#x27;ve been pushing for node.js and MongoDB for over three years now, and finally seeing them gain a lot of traction.  Right now I&#x27;m pulling for docker.io and CoreOS to gain the same kinds of traction (and learning go).<p>I don&#x27;t think what the author is asking for is impossible.. but I would be more interested in either stronger core development skills or stronger design skills, you won&#x27;t likely get both.

I&#x27;m really not sure.<p>&#x27;forall x. A x. x&#x27; is a type of polymorphic values. Given such a value, I can instantiate the type-variable to any instance of the type class A. For instance, given<p><pre><code>  x :: Num a => a\n</code></pre>\nI can write<p><pre><code>  y :: Float\n  y = x\n  \n  z :: Integer\n  z = x\n</code></pre>\nNow if &#x27;class A x => B x&#x27;, then B is a subclass of A. In that case, in the type &#x27;forall x. B x => x&#x27;, the type variable x is more restricted. For instance, if I substitute &quot;Integral&quot; for &quot;Num&quot; in the type declaration for x, my code breaks. How&#x27;s that for LSP?<p><pre><code>  x :: forall a. Integral a => a\n</code></pre>\nNow I can no longer instantiate the a to Float:<p><pre><code>  y :: Float\n  y = x\n</code></pre>\nSo I can do stuff with &#x27;forall a. Num a&#x27; which I cannot do with &#x27;forall a. Integral a&#x27;, even though Integral is a subclass of Num.<p>More generally, you cannot coerce a value of type &#x27;forall x. B x => x&#x27; to one of type &#x27;forall x. A x => x&#x27;, because that would allow the type variable to range outside B. Consider:<p><pre><code>  x :: forall x. Real x\n  x = 0.5\n\n  coerce :: (forall x. Real x) -> (forall x. Num x)\n\n  n :: forall x. Num x\n  n = coerce x\n\n  m :: Integer\n  m = n\n</code></pre>\nThis is type-correct, but semantically invalid, since the m has lost precision from x.<p>If you want to talk about contravariance, you can note that when you add a type-class constraint of the form A x => x, you&#x27;ve basically got an implication, and the &quot;A x&quot; is in contravariant position. That&#x27;s why your example is, if anything, the wrong way around.<p>What you can do with existential types in Haskell is kind of like subtyping. At least, it&#x27;s kind of like what you do in the C++ example with abstract types. But that&#x27;s because abstract types are kind of like existential types. Full class hierarchies can then be mocked with Haskell type classes, existential quantifiers and explicit coercion functions, but that&#x27;s because subclassing is kind of like containment which is kind of like implication which is kind of like the type of a coercion function. But by this stage, we&#x27;ve got a long way off from saying that type-class hierarchies in Haskell are <i>subtype</i> hierarchies, as you originally suggested. They&#x27;re certainly not in Haskell 98, and with existential types, they don&#x27;t give you the implicit upcasting that comes from values having multiple types. Even with existential types, all values have exactly one type, and this is crucial to remember when trying to reason about Haskell&#x27;s type system. In other words, forget about subtypes!",1387189580

I think it is more general, but lines like &quot;access to Twilio swag&quot; suggest it might be otherwise. The application page (<a href=\"http://ahoy.twilio.com/heroes\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ahoy.twilio.com/heroes</a>) is 2/3 about Twilio, which adds to this impression. Adding some text emphasizing that you do/don&#x27;t need to evangelise Twilio would be good.<p>Next up, what kind of commitments are you signing up for? An hour a week of Hangouts, or is there more involvement? What time do you expect to run hangouts? Are you reviewed at the end of each track, and are there conditions you must meet to start the next track?",1387188181

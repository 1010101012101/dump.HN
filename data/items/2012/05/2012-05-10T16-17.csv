3954532,comment,3954158,3954158,1,0,mindcrime,,,"One premise of this article is faulty.  They presume that you can only accept an unpaid internship if you're from a wealthy / privileged family or whatever.  But that's not true.  There's no particular reason you couldn't, say, work an unpaid internship 8 hours during the day, and work a second job at night, busing tables, washing dishes, working as a barista at Starbucks, or whatever.   Plenty of people already work 2 jobs to make ends meet, so a college age kid with (hopefully) minimal living expenses could very likely manage this.<p>Note that I'm talking summer internship, when school is out, of course.  I'm not proposing one should go to school, work a real job and work an internship.<p>This is also not to refute the idea that unpaid internships may be bad for other reasons... I'm just arguing against the idea that they're bad because they are only available to the children of the privileged.",1336669177

This means that I on my system at least don't care anymore whether the project is built with GCC or with clang and I can use either or for my own projects.<p>The thing though is that the C++ standard doesn't have a default ABI, so saying that it is non-standard isn't even the case, that we get any compatibility is nice at all, and I understand that complaint.<p>The biggest issue I've ran into is that even with the same compiler on the same platform (using MSVC 2008) setting different compiler flags generated completely different code and memory layouts for std::vector that caused me to not be able to link against a DLL.

I don't recommend doing this in embedded devices or an OS kernel (this is probably why even C++ OS kernels have exceptions disabled, and no STL implementation).<p>But if you're just an app running in an operating system with virtual memory, the kernel's out-of-memory-killer can take you out anytime anyway, so trying to recover from every single failed memory allocation is often futile. The most likely reason to get a failed memory allocation on such a system is that you're out of <i>address space</i> (in 32-bit environments). If this is an issue for your app, you'll need to take higher level design decisions to cope with this fact anyway.<p>If you actually run out of memory (physical + swap) on such a system, you will usually not find out on allocation. Instead, allocations (mmap()/sbrk()) will succeed, but when you write to a previously untouched memory page, it will page fault, not find a backing store for it, and invoke the out-of-memory-killer. Good luck recovering from that.<p>Just to be clear, this doesn't absolve you from managing and conserving your memory diligently. It's just that if you wait for memory allocations to fail before reining in your program, you've probably made your user's system swap so badly it's barely usable. No cookie for you!",1336666464

Even 10 years ago, what general purpose computing platform had all the features of a modern smartphone? Including access to multiple networks and services for transferring data at varying degrees of synchronicity -- think capture video vs broadcast video vs video chat.  What app was commonly used by regular people to handle capture, editing, review and multiple sharing options for both photo and video?<p>A single glyph is simply not enough anymore.  We can reasonably distinguish between text-in-a-box, still-in-a-box (cliche landscape) and video-in-a-box (stick figure with action lines).  But we'll need multiple glyphs in combination to distinguish between video-to-be-streamed-down, video-to-be-broadcast, video-to-be-sent-via-email, video-to-be-captured, etc.<p>And this won't be too difficult.  To some extent we're already doing this, with arrows and combo glyphs to distinguish between things like Save/Delete/Copy/Burn/Share.",1336665970

3954212,comment,3952263,3954133,8,0,krschultz,,,"Eh, I don't really buy any of that. Have you actually worked in the mechanical engineering world? I feel like it's far more gray than software engineering. I might have a specs on the output, but the environment is the actual physical world with all of its problems. Corrosion, temperature, vibration, dirt, dust, etc. It just screws with you the entire time. The abstract environment of a computer is tame in comparison. The only thing you have to worry about is the dependencies - which is basically configuration managament. Configuration managament is a problem in the mechanical world too. Except if you design a power plant to Rev B of the drawing, and show up with a Rev A drawing part that doens't fit, you might be out millions of dollars and months of times because there is no 'recompile' button when it comes to giant machined parts.<p>As for your specific examples, 'different kinds of hardware' is no different than saying my system needs to work at -30F and 130F temperature. Materials behave very differently at different temperatures and we have to account for that. Some metals are weaker in temperatures as high as +25F. That's something you will see all the time.<p>You are also vastly over-rating the complexity of scaling. It's really not that hard. Are you really going to tell me it's harder to figure out how to scale a web site than it is to build a rocket engine? Because there are about 1,000 web sites out there with millions of users and only about 10 organizations building rockets.",1336665939

However, given the nature of this project, it should have been clear that exception should not have been used in the first place. Instead, be very explicit about error handling.

They are making other unprecedented (for them) moves on the ARM platform in relation to JIT compilation and the other restrictions which make Firefox an impossibility. Imposing these kinds of limitations has never been Microsoft's way before.<p>Above, I noted that they seem to believe this is a battleground; I stand by that statement. Microsoft seems to have made the conscious decision to emulate Apple in locking down ARM in a way that will benefit them. This is not a value judgement; it's an assessment of what seems to be their intention. It may be wholly within their rights, but it's hard to argue that it isn't something of a change for them.",1336665829

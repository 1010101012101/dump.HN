Let us imagine that either one loses a massive number of soldiers, say, 1 million soldiers. Using nuclear weapons would not exactly give one an advantage unless one would be able to destroy 100% of the enemy's decision-making centers in a first attack, which is impossible. Thus, if losing 1 million soldiers is bad, losing 10 million civilians is even worse. An eye for an eye? Shanghai for Los Angeles? Hong Kong for NYC? This is madness.",1238733210

I feel that this is the driving force for everything that China has done recently<p>yeah I agree though that war for Taiwan is unlikely, since China's real invasion of Taiwan already started years ago. It's just too lucrative for Taiwanese manufacturing businesses to set up shop in China, and they've already been migrating to China en-mass years ago. Add to that Chinese laws forcing many of these Taiwanese businesses to have a cap as to how much money they can transfer outside of China (specifically back to Taiwan) and then you can see the long term problem for Taiwan...",1238732812

544483,comment,544458,544458,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> An additional complication is that we cannot make such a huge reduction because the current human population of the Earth far exceeds its carrying capacity: a lot of people would have to die.<p>This is a persistent myth that really needs to die.  <i>Right now</i>, per capita world food production is roughly 3000 calories/day/person.  This means that with <i>present</i> food production, even assuming we never get another ounce of efficiency, we could feed a world population up to 9-10 billion.  At present growth trends, demographers expect world population to top out at about 10-12 billion and then start declining just because of lower birthrates in industrialized countries.  We only need a slight increase to support that, and we're home free.<p>So why are there starving children in Africa?  It's almost always because of distribution problems throughout war-torn regions with poor infrastructure.  In the south of a country, they'll be famine and war, while in the north food rots in the fields.<p>The impediments to good nutrition for all are all social, not scientific.  If we weren't such assholes, nobody would be dying of hunger.",1238732464

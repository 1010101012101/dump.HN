For me, it&#x27;s a great way to develop SPAs.<p>Unfortunately, all too often you need to inspect something in the Chrome dev tools - which causes issues because you can only have one debugger connected.<p>Someone created a proxy to handle multiple connections [1] but it requires running the Dev Tools in a separate tab via the proxy too.

It was a website which indexed content from others. I had coded the &quot;spider&quot; in such a way that it was quite flexible if the content on the page changed a bit and it stood me well for those three years. I had a database back up system in place that backed up to another server.<p>But then I began to realise that although I had gave the site zero-maintenance, it wasn&#x27;t truly zero maintenance. If I&#x27;d had a hardware failure, I&#x27;d have a backup of the database but no way to automatically spin up a new server and put it in place. But even if I had some monitoring in place for that, what if the monitoring service went down?

Consider <a href=""http://totallysamsworld.com/backpacker-stereotypes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://totallysamsworld.com/backpacker-stereotypes/</a> , which lists &quot;Backpacker Stereotypes&quot;. The last is &quot;The ones who want to ‘find themselves’&quot;:<p>> These confused and emotional people have gone travelling to find themselves. They don’t know what they want to do for the rest of their lives, and all their friends are settled down, popping out babies and in great long term careers. Whereas they want to avoid commitment and responsibility for as long as possible. These backpackers can go from one extreme to the other… Living by YOLO, trying crazy new things with open minds, to getting all drunk and emoshe, crying on strangers and treating them like therapists. These guys are great when they’re on form, but if they are having a ‘moment’ it’s best to avoid them like the plague.<p>Here&#x27;s a blog post from someone who has post-travel depression after a &quot;year of mind-blowing adventures&quot; - <a href=""http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/coming-home-blues/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/coming-home-blues/</a> :<p>> You find your friends don’t understand the new you, don’t want to hear about your time sailing the Pacific while they sat in rush hour, or don’t get why you feel so uncomfortable being back. “What? You don’t like it here anymore?”<p>I think the comments help enrich the understanding of those with post-travel blues. Some choice quotes, that are not indicative of the whole, are:<p>> Can someone please help me cure the travel bug!! It’s ruining my life, relationships, careers and friendships!! ahhhh<p>> How can we not change after having experienced everything that long term travel offers? It’s hard to explain this to family and friends without sounding self righteous.<p>> If you don’t want to get married and start popping out babies it’s like the end of the world for some people. [I picked this one because it&#x27;s almost exactly the stereotype quote from earlier.]<p>> What I find astounding is that many people don’t really care that I did. What to ME is an amazing thing, they don’t think much of it.<p>> Paul Theroux has a great quote: “You go away for a long time, and you return a different person. You never come all the way back.”<p>> Yep, there’s just absolutely no way that people who haven’t travelled long-term can understand what we go through.<p>I quoted these as examples to show that, yes, this is a real problem, that many people have to deal with. One of the ways to deal with a problem is to infer that it makes one special, perhaps like the agony of Marine Corp training makes one special, or of hazing. I believe the author&#x27;s coping mechanism is to embrace the emotion pain, and the advice to others to avoid the pain is in fact a boast that the author can take the pain when others can&#x27;t. &quot;Thank you sir, may I have another!&quot;<p>You believe that the original author recommends &quot;people to not open their minds until their 40s&quot;. I don&#x27;t believe the author is doing that at all.

9912559,comment,9904428,9906746,0,0,mikeash,,,"900 miles in a day is stretching it, but not entirely out of the question. You can sustain a long distance average speed of about 55-60MPH (counting time for stops) in a Model S 85. It will be slower than you could do in a gas car if you push it. If you <i>don&#x27;t</i> push it, it won&#x27;t be any slower, and could even be faster. (Refueling a gas car takes a lot less time, but can&#x27;t really be done concurrently with other things. If you were going to get coffee or whatever at each charging stop regardless, then you&#x27;re looking at 5 minutes for gas versus zero for electricity. Accomplishing this with perfection is, of course, a bit of a challenge.)<p>Note that an hour every 300 miles isn&#x27;t generally how you&#x27;d do it. Charging is faster the closer your battery is to empty, so your best bet is to work in the bottom ~50% of your charge range when possible, and spend ~20 minutes charging at intervals of ~150 miles. You&#x27;ll note that this is about how far apart Tesla&#x27;s superchargers are spaced. That, to me, is about the right interval for a quick coffee, bathroom, or stretch break. Your mileage may, of course, vary.<p>The biggest problem with your particular trip isn&#x27;t the time for charging, but the general lack of charging infrastructure along the shortest route. If you route through superchargers, the distance is about 300 miles longer due to the need to take I-70 into Kansas to follow the chargers. This should improve with time, and current owners will benefit, but until it does there are some trips that are just not as good with superchargers. But improvements there pay off a lot better than improvements in range beyond 300 miles.",1437334946

The problem for the moment is that company A is not running well anymore and company B is not making profit as we just started 1 year ago.<p>For the moment I&#x27;m not paid as good as before the start of the new company and I&#x27;m able to pay myself today 500€/month but the balans of my company C is not positive.<p>For the moment I&#x27;m thinking and doubting a lot about my current situation, me and my girlfriend are searching to buy our own property and soon there will be kids. I believe really in the new company we started but have bad feeling today because I&#x27;m not winning money as I would be just working as employee.<p>I put this question here on hackernews because I want to find people who are/were in the same situation as I am for the moment and to get some feedback what will be the best step for the future and career.<p>Feel free to give some advise or opinion about this scenario. Should I continue to fight for it or search some other freelance job? Is it part of starting new company?",1437334946

9912549,comment,9912016,9912016,0,0,marknadal,,,"Yes. Or at least that is the goal.<p>What type of &quot;system&quot; is it? A database.<p>I got fed up having to do maintenance on my database, specifically worrying about having to expand its storage capacity. I&#x27;d constantly be woken up in the middle of the night because my entire web application had crashed because it ran out of disk space, because the database greedily pre-allocated excess space to improve performance. I&#x27;m not a DevOps guy, so figuring out LVM and MDADM on the fly was a nightmare. And as my app got more popular, things got worse and I just could not keep up.<p>But then I sat back and thought about it for a minute. I was deploying my app in the cloud, not on my own physical machines. Why was I worrying about expanding storage capacity when the cloud can sell me more of it than I could possibly keep up with? Why was I maintaining finite space when there was an infinite amount available? That doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>The other problem was that despite the fact everything else was working (the web server, the frontend javascript, etc.), if the database server was down then nothing would function properly because data is the life blood of my app. This sucks, if one piece breaks the whole thing is defunct.<p>So after a while, I decided to change all this. I decided to build a database that would be zero-maintenance, it hit the top of hackernews several times, some big name investors (Tim Draper) got behind it. Check out this demo of it automatically recovering from the complete loss of primaries - <a href=""https://medium.com/@marknadal/gun-0-2-0-pre-release-auto-recovery-of-primary-fault-5f4ffbe63301"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@marknadal/gun-0-2-0-pre-release-auto-rec...</a> .<p>So how is it zero maintenance? Well some other people in this thread mentioned some important points:<p>- There are fewer moving parts - there is no database server. Instead it gets embedded into your app server and your frontend (see next point), so the only thing you have to maintain is your app. If your app is flawless or (more likely) can auto-restart just fine, then you&#x27;ll won&#x27;t need to do any maintenance.<p>- It is highly available and redundant because it uses Peer-to-Peer architecture, like BitTorrent. So even if your server crashes, your app can continue to work in offline mode or with WebRTC (not implemented yet) continue to interact with other users. When the server auto-restarts at some point, the offline data will sync back up and resolve any conflicts. If you have more than one server running, then things will continue to work even if one or many of them crash.<p>- Immutable data allows the system to recover and resolve conflicts without your manual intervention. I&#x27;ll let others talk about how awesome immutable data is, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard enough about how many problems it helps with. Especially when it comes to maintaining systems, stuff can&#x27;t get corrupted, and even when it does, the immutable data allows it to reconstruct itself.<p>- State machines allow the system in advance to know what is valid and invalid behavior, so it for the most part can avoid going down paths that are &quot;incorrect&quot; which lead to having to do manual maintenance, because it is already instructed in the first place what states to avoid or how to exit those states if it gets into them.<p>I&#x27;m super glad you asked your question, because I feel like a lot of software developers out there are super negative and bitter about it because most systems they have worked with have basically ruined their lives (like what happened to me, having to fix stuff in the middle of the night). But just because a lot of things have been like this, doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t borrow from engineers or mathematicians ways to make zero-maintenance systems. So I really hope you find what you are looking for or build one yourself, if you do please let me know mark@gunDB.io because I&#x27;m interested in that sort of stuff. Maybe we could start some group/forum around zero-maintenance systems!",1437334799
9912548,comment,9912425,9912425,0,0,djcapelis,,,"I&#x27;ve happily been on airplanes in most of the countries discussed.  From small airlines who gave me handwritten boarding passes in Myanmar to non-western but world-class carriers that are still banned from US airspace over safety issues from the past to flights in and out of many of these airports using major international carriers.<p>This is a fascinating article about a lot of aspects of development and parts where different airports are behind, but getting on an airplane in Asia is still one of the safer things I do on that continent.  (Or any others I&#x27;ve been on.)  I find US media has a habit of doing hand-wringing about other countries safety problems, or perceived safety problems when there&#x27;s really not a substantial difference in outcomes.<p>Also... specifically in the case of South Korea, I find it funny the article breathlessly implies that since South Korea has only installed two wind down-shear warning systems, that&#x27;s somehow behind the curve.  That almost certainly means ICN has one, which means a shockingly large percentage of that country&#x27;s international flights are through an airport with coverage.  Assuming the other system is either at Gimpo or Busan, that takes care of a large percentage of the remaining traffic.  (There&#x27;s certainly domestic air travel in South Korea, but last time I needed to move about the country, I just took the KTX bullet train.  So much more awesome.)<p>WSJ&#x27;s implication that South Korea is unspeakably behind in deploying these systems seems a little strange.  I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t have computerized flow management, but I&#x27;d also be interested to understand why.  I&#x27;d hazard a guess it might be because a lot of the traffic in that country is on either approach or take off, so it&#x27;s already in local controllers hands and flow control for transiting traffic is simply not a large part of their controllers&#x27; duties?  I dunno, anyone an aircraft controller who can shine light on this one?  :)  I doubt South Korea hasn&#x27;t deployed the technology because they can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to, Seoul makes most any American city feel like the the past in comparison.  I live in SF and coming home from some of the cities in Asia feels like moving backwards a decade.",1437334786

I don&#x27;t know what to say, but thank you to all for taking the time to respond and upvoting this thread. I have never expected this to happen. I will respond to each commentor who specifically asked a direct question as time allows, but for now, I will jot down more about me and why I have the career that I have.<p>To start, I earned my BSc in Public Health and Safety. After few years in the field, I became disgruntled with my career choice and felt miserable going to work each day. I felt trapped in a rat race full of fake smiles. I had to decide that I will either do this for 30 or so years and retire, or just leave. Well, the decision was made for me and I was fired...ahahah. I wish they could also fire my student debt. The annoyance I felt working in such environment where I was not being challenged enough and not learning much was oozing from every pore on my body, and managers could smell it.<p>Fast forward, I went off to Africa for vacation and the basic life necessities we enjoy every day such as clean water, electricity and food safety were non-existent. Everything in many parts of Africa are run by NGO&#x27;s. There were rules that prohibit people from planting their own food! The NGO&#x27;s want to supply you the food from their end. Being self sufficient is not part of the game for these NGO&#x27;s. Anyways, I could go on forever about the dire situations in Africa and the corruption from within the nation and from outside agencies, but it will be too long for one post.<p>Fast forward some more, and I came back home. No job. No savings. My cousin told me to apply for a corrections job. I got it. And guess what? I love it. I use my natural verbal judo skills and empathy to get the job done. It is scary, but ultimately, you either get yourself in hot water or stay out of the hot water as a jail guard. I chose the latter. Long story short, I really enjoy my job and there are multiple ideas and what if&#x27;s I come up with when I am there. I was always around entrepreneurs. The best entrepreneur I know of personally is my mother. I learned from her the idea that create something people want. In her case, it was order what people want. I always wondered why my mother would order only ladies clothing and jewelry and perfume for women only. Why not men? Because my mother understood these women and their inherent need to change clothes all the time, and she satisfied this by purchasing everything they needed as a wholesale from Middle East. She never bought even once what men want. She stuck to her believe and made a lot of money doing it by satisfying her core customers: housewives. I think we can all learn from people in our lives that made a silent contribution to push you to entrepreneurship, and for me, it was my mother.<p>I have declared this little blurb last night because I can&#x27;t stand being the idea guy anymore. I have countless ideas, but I understand the need to learn and become a sufficient partner when I do find a co-founder. The idea I will work on with the online coding bootcamp is from my  workplace. I would like to streamline something so redundant that I do every day using technology. There are  multiple things I could work on, but I have to start from  somewhere first. Off to work for now, again, I will respond to direct questions from certain commentors. Again, thank you.",1437334741

They had to; the original Symbolics LISP machine had 45-minute garbage collections, as the GC fought with the virtual memory.  There&#x27;s a long list of tricks. This one is to write-protect data memory during the GC&#x27;s marking phase, so marking and computation can proceed simultaneously.  When the code stores into a write-protected page, the store is trapped and that pointer is logged for GC attention later.  This works as long as the GC&#x27;s marker is faster than the application&#x27;s pointer changing.  There are programs for which this approach is a lose.  A large sort of a tree, where pointers are being retargeted with little computation between changes, is such a program.<p>If they&#x27;re getting 3ms stalls on a 500MB heap, they&#x27;re doing pretty well.  That the stall time doesn&#x27;t increase with heap size is impressive.<p>Re <i>&quot;avoid fragmentation to begin with by storing objects of the same size in the same memory span.&quot;</i> That&#x27;s easy today, because we have so much memory and address space. The simplest version of that is to allocate memory in units of powers of 2, with each MMU page containing only one size of block.  The size round-up wastes memory, of course.  But you can use any exponent in the range 1..2, and have, for example, block sizes every 20%.  This approach is popular with conservative garbage collectors (ones that don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s a pointer and what&#x27;s just data that looks like a pointer) because the size of a block can be determined from the pointer alone.",1437334435

I can do what web devs do and what people from bootcamp do, better and fast as I&#x27;ve seen these people here at this company. It employs around 400 devs and I&#x27;m considered as the one of the best in the organization. I&#x27;ve been offered 68k at this where starting is 50k for starting developer once I graduate. I&#x27;ve got similar offers from around the area.

However, I&#x27;m not learning anything I didn&#x27;t know (from doing few side projects). I&#x27;m doing all Microsoft stack from Javascript, C#, ASP .net MVC(pretty similar to ruby on rails) T-SQL, Sharepoint etc. I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;m writing large programs in C# (which is nice lang btw) but I&#x27;m only learning business rules from these &quot;senior devs&quot; and which database has what data.",1437334181

E.g. just talking to a person with severed brain stem from one side in sufficiently lowered voice is sufficient to provide different information to each brain half and cause them to diverge - coherence is lost pretty much from the first moment; though the <i>extent</i> of it can remain quite low for some types of information for quite some time.<p>> You could modify the source code of a distributed database so that the nodes in a cluster were no longer guaranteed to be consistent. That wouldn&#x27;t show that consistency is an illusion; it would just show that you can break stuff by modifying it.<p>This is a poor analogy. In this case the brainstem is the replication mechanism, not computation.<p>Take a multi-master database and sever the replication, but let the nodes <i>most of the time</i> see <i>mostly</i> the same data. Now change the database so that it tries to infer what the results <i>actually</i> should be based on patterns seen in the past, so that it actively lies to you about what the basis for the query responses are (the database tells you it is derived from inserted data, but half the time it&#x27;s computed based on imperfect assumptions of what the other node will have seen).<p>This is what is actually observed in experiments on people with severed brain stems: You know you&#x27;ve fed bullshit data in, yet the system responds with providing a result with a confidence it has no justification for. You can argue we can&#x27;t prove that the motivation is to maintain the illusion of self, but the <i>effect</i> certainly is to maintain an illusion of a coherent self - or at least try to.  Unlike the database, you can ask each brain half what it based it&#x27;s decision on, and the deceived brain half will usually insist <i>it</i> made the decision based on x,y,z, even when <i>researchers</i> made the decision without its knowledge.<p>The only change is blocking communication.<p>Yet when one brain half tells you it made a decision and explains to you why, you can&#x27;t trust a word it&#x27;s saying, as it will present itself with equivalent certainty whether or not it <i>actually</i> made the decision, as long as it <i>thinks</i> some part of the collective actually did make the decision.<p>Think of any part of your brain as some government spokesperson who is trying to speak for the whole, and who needs to answer questions about statements they personally never made without letting slip that it&#x27;s total chaos behind the scenes.",1437333046

E.g. in the 1980s or 1990s, someone probably had to operate that dam&#x27;s SCADA system from a particular console in a particular room.<p>&quot;As we get more connected we require to maintain the software.&quot;<p>Yes. As soon as everyone started networking everything together - and <i>especially</i> after they started putting everything on the internet - those old systems become a dangerous liability. IMO it is effectively impossible to have a truly fixed-design system continue to operate in a reliable way when it exists in a changing environment. Computing systems are too complex for any designer to understand all of the possible conditions in advance.<p>While it&#x27;s true that <i>if nothing goes wrong</i>, the dam will probably continue to operate correctly, if it&#x27;s now attached to a network, then there are all sorts of things that can make those vulnerabilities an issue later:<p>- Obviously there&#x27;s the possibility of someone tampering with it for malicious purposes. Maybe they&#x27;re a foreign government who wants to destabilize the US. Maybe they&#x27;re a malicious stock trader who wants to short the stock of the dam owner.<p>- If it&#x27;s a really poorly-written system from the 1980s, it probably crashes if it receives input beyond a certain length, because of e.g. a buffer overflow. Maybe someone mistypes an IP address in a configuration field and suddenly a database client tries to connect to it and triggers that bug.<p>- Does it represent time in some way? If so, is it going to enter unexpected territory when whatever counter it uses flips over? If it&#x27;s old enough that the author is dead, it&#x27;s probably using a 32-bit integer <i>at most</i>, and so is susceptible to the same kind of problem as legacy Unix systems.<p>Etc.<p>IMO, as soon as computing systems start to be networked together, they have to be treated more like plants in a garden than machines in a factory - if there isn&#x27;t a &quot;gardener&quot; keeping things under control, it will turn into a disaster. It&#x27;s still a deterministic system, but it&#x27;s one in which the number of variables is far too high (IMO) to effectively plan out every possible contingency and response in advance.

However, I suspect they would do better to separate the hardware products from the software.<p>I would happily buy a laptop with a good hardware spec that came with Windows without the junkware and with physical switches to disable all the sensors and transmitters. That would be a significant improvement on the things available to me today, and I would be willing to pay a modest premium for it. (These devices do already look quite expensive given their specs.)<p>However, by taking this pure stance on the software side as well, it runs headlong into the same thing that keeps most people out of FSF world: you buy a computer for the software you can run on it, and the software you get that way simply isn&#x27;t as good in many cases as what you can get on Windows or OS X.<p>Here&#x27;s an obvious example. I can buy a new Windows PC and probably watch the Blu-Ray I bought while I was out by (a) inserting the disc, and (b) pressing play. In contrast, the site here explains in great detail how installing software on Linux to watch a DVD is likely to be illegal in many places and they aren&#x27;t going to supply the software themselves for that reason. Which of these is going to give a better user experience?<p>I wish them luck, because their goal is a noble one even if I&#x27;m not personally willing to give up the useful capabilities of mainstream software to go as far as they do. I hope they at least inspire more hardware companies to install physical switches to prevent abuse of the ever-increasing numbers of sensors and transmitters on these mobile devices, and inspire the likes of Microsoft to provide better controls over what software running on their platform can do.",1437332733

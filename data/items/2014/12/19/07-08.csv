On Linux, a very handy tool is strace(1), which lets you see the system calls being made by a program.  Often the culprit can be seen when open(2) is called, e.g. the file being opened is not the expected one.<p>The cool thing about strace is you don&#x27;t need access to the source code.  I recently debugged a program which took 60 seconds to run on one computer vs. an expected time of 1 second.  In strace I saw that it made thousands of requests to a remote server, so the round-trip time determined the program&#x27;s execution time.  It turned out to be calling getpwent() which ends up sending one network request per user in the domain (!).  This was easily replaced by getpwuid(), and the program then sent only one request per run.<p>If Mr. Skeet used a tool similar to strace (which exists on Windows thanks to SysInternals), he might have noticed that the bytes read by the MD5 program were not the same as those read by the Java one, even if the OS hid the entire path redirection process from view.",1418975903
8771434,comment,8770505,8770505,0,0,wrd,,,"My assessment of this is that you have motivation in the sense of interest but that you&#x27;re afraid. Not entirely sure of what, but mostly it sounds like social consequences of being/feeling inferior. I can empathize -- that&#x27;s a real fear. Fortunately, it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s going to kill you in a physical sense so you can train yourself to work around it. It sounds like right now you&#x27;re running low on courage. The key word in your question is &quot;depression,&quot; and it sounds like everything else you&#x27;ve said points to clinical depression of some kind. It seems like there are things that you want to do but right now you&#x27;re keeping yourself down out of a set of abstract fears that are difficult to verbalize. I don&#x27;t know that this works for everyone, but I think one way to wiggle yourself out of this hole you&#x27;re in is to deliberately do things that scare you. Cultivate courage. Teach yourself to be strong and resilient. Learn to keep pushing forward no matter what. Don&#x27;t give in.<p>To be concrete: We want to develop courage as a skill, so we need to practice it. When faced with two decisions, pick the one that requires more courage, even if it doesn&#x27;t make as much sense. When you feel like you can&#x27;t keep up or that you&#x27;re failing at a task, quietly tell yourself, &quot;No, I&#x27;m not going to stop. Even though it doesn&#x27;t feel good I am going to keep doing this to make myself more courageous.&quot; Just do whatever you can to exercise that courage muscle. You can start small and work your way up. If you keep it up you&#x27;ll soon find yourself able to be courageous in situations where you couldn&#x27;t before. But it all depends on practice. So be courageous, even in small ways, and work from there. Once you have courage, depression--and life--become easier to tackle.",1418975874

It has made me realize that my situation was not as bad as I&#x27;d felt initially, but rather many other people had the same deal growing up.<p>Contrary to the shock and rejection of belief expressed by a lot of people who have obviously grown up in areas with well funded schools and financially secure parents, this sort of thing happened to quite a lot of people, and it is STILL happening today.<p>I&#x27;d say there is still some kid out in some house out where I used to live, who is sitting in his room, hopefully not under the same oppressive circumstances as myself, but is working with his dads &quot;old Windows 98 system&quot; etc because it&#x27;s all he has. There&#x27;s no &quot;right&quot; in Australia to be up to date with the latest and greatest. No kid here has a guaranteed right to a mobile phone and a high powered computer in his bedroom, but is very fortunate to have them.<p>Thankfully, technology is much more affordable nowadays.

8771426,comment,8770505,8770505,0,0,topkai22,,,"Motivation is a funny thing. I have often felt motivated and excited to do something only to find that when I sit down to do it I just stare at my hands for a bit and then walk away. I&#x27;ve been getting better at finishing things lately, it is tough. Here is what&#x27;s helped me\n1.) Deadlines. This is one of the great things about having a job- you have to produce something by date X or there will be consequences for you and your team, which brings me to\n2.) Teamwork. Not wanting to disappoint others is a huge motivator. I work far harder when I think someone is counting on me to finish something then I do on my own. Join a hackathon team (preferably in person) and agree to produce a component. You won&#x27;t sleep till its done.\n3.) Permission to fail. From yourself. Especially about the small stuff. 4/5 side projects I start ( and mean the ones where I get past staring at my hands) end up being terrible ideas or far to hard to implement. But 1/5 have been great, and totally worth everything else. It took me a long time to stop being embarrassed about the failures of my side projects, but once I realized that starting was a heck of a lot further then most everyone else got, I felt a whole lot better about my mistakes and found it much easier to start new ones\n4.) Success. Yes there is a chicken and the egg problem here, but once you have success at something you&#x27;ll probably find yourself continuing to do it. Note- this is how WoW gets you, feeding you lots of little successes at a variety fairly rapid rate.\n5.) Cutting out the crap- I had to unplug my Xbox in college and put it in storage. It sounds like you need to do something similar- take steps to cut the electronic media down to zero. Uninstall the games, disconnect the cable, etc. It&#x27;s really not that severe ( you can always hook them back up) but you do have to think about it before committing the time. Also, exercise if you aren&#x27;t, because exercise is surprisingly good at mood and effective function improvement.<p>I&#x27;d recommend taking a job, even a mediocre corporate one, if you can. The need to forces you to learn things, even if it&#x27;s not what you expected or would have picked on your own.  Failing that, other users have suggested great volunteer ideas. I recommend going to your local hackerspace or coworking space if you have one. Being around other people doing stuff is hugely motivating.",1418975426

Thus, a project can specify when they are adequately funded and not take extra. Projects that don&#x27;t show good use of funds over time won&#x27;t keep getting people funding them. Anyway, if the system actually gets to where projects are adequately funded, it will already mean the system is a success.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a natural <i>intuition</i> that you should pay <i>less</i> if others join you, but that only makes any sense after a project already has adequate funding. Anyway, the intuition is a failure in reality. Why should I add my donation if it just means others will donate less? The question to think about is: &quot;what will most encourage others to donate who aren&#x27;t donating now?&quot; And the answer is definitely in matching as a big factor.<p>Anyway, the whole snowdrift dilemma is about the fact that you would indeed like to donate as little as you can and have everyone else donate as much as they can.

A punch to the side of the head was a &quot;clip over the ear&quot; etc. The police however seemed not to care, I will never forget hearing their &quot;Ah yeah.&quot; reactions to it, but again they face the same thing as mentioned above. Even if you&#x27;re not legally allowed to hit a child now, it&#x27;s still seen in some places here as an unwritten omission of law to discipline your child if it is &quot;Reasonable&quot;, such as a smack on the bum etc.<p>Indeed being kept inside the home wasn&#x27;t really the bad part of it all. I have always been much of a loner, and it was very likely I wouldn&#x27;t have done much outside of the home. I did sometimes &quot;Run away&quot; for nights, and I would walk through the city or walk out into the country for a very very very long time at night wondering where to go or what to do. Now that I look back on it, I&#x27;m actually very surprised albeit greatful that I never was abducted or robbed. But at that point, I didn&#x27;t really care where I went or what happened because anything seemed better than what was going on at home.",1418973960

They then wanted absolutely nothing to do with either himself or me.<p><a href=""http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/child-death-cover-up-how-child-protection-system-left-peanut-2-to-die-at-home/story-fnpn118l-1227154877199"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/child-death-cover-...</a><p>The Department of Community Services was responsible for overseeing cases such as child abuse etc in during that time (or DOCS as we called it). My counsellor spoke in great depth to me about it, but he was not confident that much would be done (as seen above, many many cases are left behind or ignored). He put in a lot of requests to DOCS to look into my situation, and they did only a few of those times, but their methods were shocking and they did absolutely nothing. They interviewed my stepfather once and it more or less consisted of &quot;have you mistreated a minor in your household?&quot; &quot;No?&quot; &quot;Oh okay well thanks anyway, bye&quot;. On another occasion, they spoke to me about it. I honestly couldn&#x27;t remember what we talked about, as I felt a bit too young to fully understand what was really going on. I spoke to so many people about it and no-one was able to help, including the police.<p>(I&#x27;m wondering if the department was understaffed or suffering some other internal crisis? They still are apparently.)<p>In 1999, I would&#x27;ve been 10 years old, so when I finally left, I was 17 nearing 18 as the new year approached. Goodbye teen years, but it would&#x27;ve been a lot worse if I was a kid. A lot of the physical nasties that occurred stopped as I grew older, perhaps out of the fact that my stepfather was aware I&#x27;d be a lot wiser about how to tackle it (ie I could more easily convince police of something going on.). He was very careful to get as close to the border-line of crossing the arrest threshold as he could, without ever actually going over it. He never hit my mother, but he hit us and we were raised by him to believe that getting either choked, kicked in the back etc was &quot;Discipline&quot; rather than abuse.<p>I&#x27;d have to agree on the inadequacy of both child protection and law enforcement here, as it&#x27;s been shown in the last couple of days with the &quot;terrorist&quot; in sydney, the justice system here is seriously broken. The same man who deprived us of liberty was walking free on around 40-50 other charges, including break and enter, sexual assault of a minor, assault etc, much like the fellow who held up the cafeteria. I don&#x27;t know where the break down is, but the justice system always seems to &quot;let people off with a warning&quot; or a light sentence. If you assault someone, expect to walk free. If you break into someones house and molest a child as he did, you walk free with a big scary &quot;warning&quot;. If you continue, it&#x27;s another big scary &quot;warning&quot; etc.<p>He&#x27;s still out today, and I haven&#x27;t pursued it, because I know that there is no way he would ever be behind bars, the justice system completely let us down and I wouldn&#x27;t trust it with my life. One of the first men I rented my first apartment with was exactly the same; multiple charges that should have landed him behind bars, yet he was walking free but with police coming to the door from time to time to &quot;check on him&quot;. Of course it wouldn&#x27;t stop any crook from doing something stupid if they are clever enough not to be caught.",1418973653
8771382,comment,8769925,8770740,0,0,throwawaykf05,,,"Yes, I found the primary torture of having bedbugs is psychological. The slightest movement on your skin sets you off on a panicked bug hunt when it&#x27;s really just an errant hair, or maybe a loose thread. Unfortunately, since we are hairy mammals and as the hair on our head tends to fall off all the time, and because hair tends to find its way inside our clothes and stick to our skin, there are hundreds of these sensations every day. The other problem is, hair is fine and we tend not to see it and assume it was just a bug that got away. This quickly makes you paranoid, and soon interferes with your ability to sleep soundly, which soon makes you irritated and eventually starts affecting your work. One of the first things to do when discovering an infestation is to realize this psychological problem and actively deal with it.<p>As for dealing with the bedbugs themselves, search for &quot;the Missouri Method&quot;. It essentially consists of making it impossible for the bugs to reach you as you sleep, which 1) gives you instantaneous relief from bites, 2) avoids having to hunt all their hiding places, and 3) disrupts their lifecycle, which over a period of few weeks, kills them. Keeping them away typically involves the use of plastic or other smooth surfaces where their legs can&#x27;t get a grip.<p>Note that the online tutorials go somewhat overboard, in my experience: you don&#x27;t need airtight seals everywhere. I managed to treat the problem successfully simply by covering my mattresses and bed with a plastic sheet ($10 roll at Home Depot) and running packing tape horizontally along the walls (to keep them from getting onto the ceilings and dropping on to you; yes, they do that). A bed-sheet on top of the plastic sheeting provides little comfort, and the crackling of the plastic is really annoying, but the peace of mind knowing that bugs can&#x27;t get to you will give you the best sleep you&#x27;ve had in weeks.",1418973635

After some googling, I built a cheap bed bug detector out of sugar solution and yeast, which produced a steady stream of CO2 for several days.  Bed bugs are attracted to the CO2 we emit, and the detector lures them in, and then they drop into some soapy water for collection.  After a few nights of nothing in the trap, I went back to the bug I had found that morning.  I had wrapped it with a tissue and thrown it in a jar.  On careful examination, it was not the right shape for a bedbug.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bedbugcentral.com/bedbugs101/early-detection-tools-methods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bedbugcentral.com/bedbugs101/early-detection-tool...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://buymarijuanaseeds.com/community/threads/question-home-made-co2-generator.88731/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buymarijuanaseeds.com/community/threads/question-home...</a>",1418973386

This seems like things that can take a tremendous amount of time, and derail them from their main mission. And I&#x27;d guess the results would be average at best in comparison to what is produced by other teams that dedicate all their time on one thing, e.g. Discourse for new forum software.<p>Their model that calculates how much money that is paid out to each project feels like the opposite to what I would prefer. One would get paid something proportional to the number of supporters ^ 2. But if I wanted to donate money to something, then, if few other people donated, I would want to donate more, so that the project got a reasonable amount of funding. And if many people donated, I&#x27;d want to automatically donate less (not more), because I don&#x27;t want the project to get more money than what it actually needs.<p>With Snowdrift&#x27;s current model, I&#x27;m afraid a few projects will get a lot more money than what they actually need, and won&#x27;t be able to use that money efficiently. Whereas most projects will get like $0.1 a month.<p>I&#x27;d love to see that their ideas work out well despite the things above :-) Best wishes to you the Snowdrift team.",1418973366

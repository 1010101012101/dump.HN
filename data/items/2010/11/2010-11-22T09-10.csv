1929280,comment,1928612,1929008,0,0,cstross,,,"Do you own one? I do. The big problem with u4/3 right now, from a user's point of view, is that the glass is about <i>double</i> the price of an equivalent full-size DSLR lens: $400-500 for a fixed-focus pancake, $700-1000 for a telephoto. Sure you can fit an adapter and use regular 4/3 or other mount-type lenses, but then you lose a bunch of the intelligence. (Also, there are issues with autofocus speed on some of the cameras.)<p>u4/3 is like Z-gauge model railways, compared to OO or HO gauge -- looks cute, but you pay through the nose for the miniaturization, and have less flexibility and a limited range of accessories to boot.<p>(I'm really hoping that Olympus, Panasonic, et al get their show in order over the next year or so and really begin to push u4/3, because <i>in principle</i> I agree with you -- but right now, it's not looking good.)<p>What I'd like to see in the meantime would be a decent telephoto-equipped compact camera with an iPhone dock built into its back in place of the display -- in effect a camera that acts as a sleeve for the iPhone, much like battery extenders such as the Mophie Juicepack. Use the iPhone's screen and user interface to control the camera, and the iPhone's storage to store the shots, but use the camera body to provide proper optics, a larger CCD, and the image processor.<p>Alas, developing such a gadget would not be cheap, and the vendor -- presumably a big camera manufacturer -- would be working to keep up with Apple's changing form factor.",1290419812

So regarding consistency, Git provides everything that SQL databases provide, not just the limited NoSQL interpretation of ""consistency"".<p>Also note that this already happens in the traditional use of Git: There, consistency checks are called ""building the application and running the test suite"".

That's not usually how college disciplinary actions work.<p>At its worst, universities will sometimes assume a student accused of wrongdoing is lying, and punish the student based solely on the word of the faculty/staff bringing the charge.  This happens in lesser cases where the administration thinks it can get away with it, and when the student is frightened of harsher sanctions that might be inflicted if the student asserts his or her rights and demands a full hearing process.<p>At its best (typically in more serious cases), the disciplinary process resembles a civil case (except instead of a jury, it's more of a tribunal) where the required proof is a preponderance of the evidence.<p>It's no wonder 200 students confessed.  If I was in that class and I'd never seen the test bank, I'd have confessed too.

(lets set aside the fact that Gekko had bribed someone on Wildman's payroll)<p>Assuming the information was gathered using public means, this type of trading should be legal.<p>Second type,where Bud Fox gathers information from various offices with his cleaning crew obviously should be illegal, perhaps not because of the trading that follows, but just because it is breaking and entering in effect.<p>Another point could be made that insider trading being made illegal obscures transparency in the markets. If company principals were allowed to trade in a shorter time-frame but with full disclosure, markets could absorb the information better.",1290417379

True, there are many people who find Twitter eminently useful, but there are far more who can't seem to figure out what the hell it's for, and I suspect many at Twitter HQ of belonging to the latter group.  There are a glut of startups right now that don't really do anything useful, but have had no problem getting funded.  The investment model seems to have moven away from ""where's the market going to be in 3-5 years"" to ""if we invest in a spaghetti website, a sailing-meets-geocaching website, a cake-delivery website, and a social media microblogging iphone app, then surely one of them will hit.""",1290417351

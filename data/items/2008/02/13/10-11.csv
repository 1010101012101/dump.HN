I am not a Microsoft fan, but I think they were successful in a time when not everything was as easy as it is today. So laughing about them - I don't know how many people really have the achievements under their belt to be in a position to do so.",1202899037

If you're not going to have 10,000 active users from day one, I'd stick with something cheap and simple like slicehost.  It should last you a surprisingly long time and save you a lot of annoying configuration.<p>I just went through scaling my app for EC2 and it took a good week to get it all worked out.  By comparison, setting up one instance on slicehost takes just a couple hours.",1202897145

One of the big differences between Queens vs the rest of NYC is in the way postal addresses are handled.<p>In Manhattan every single address ends with &quot;New York NY&quot; and in Brooklyn every address ends in &quot;Brooklyn NY&quot;, but in Queens the addresses correspond to the individual &quot;cities&quot; or rather neighborhoods that comprise the borough. So instead of &quot;Queens NY&quot; addresses end with &quot;Long Island City NY&quot; or &quot;Flushing NY&quot; or &quot;Jamaica NY&quot; despite being in the city of NYC.<p>So maybe this side project, which presumably is based on scraping the data from the New Yorker site, doesn&#x27;t have all the various areas of Queens coded into it.<p>Or maybe it does, I&#x27;m just speculating wildly without actually looking into the matter.",1443628787

Lift up on the accelerator quickly to upshift, press it down quickly to downshift. One thing that I notice easily when riding is when the driver is constantly staying at only a few km/h slower than the shift point, causing the engine to spin faster and consume more fuel than necessary. It often means the car is louder and vibrates more too, so not a good thing overall.<p>This is harder to do for newer models with quieter engines and smoother shifts but older automatics have very noticeable shifts and engine noise to judge whether you&#x27;re near the bottom or top of each gear. It&#x27;s <i>very</i> noticeable in larger trucks and buses.<p>Edit: another point I&#x27;ll add to the list is traffic light phasing - look far ahead and observe the timing of the lights, and adjust your speed so that you&#x27;re not going too fast (you&#x27;ll arrive at a light before it turns green) or too slow (it&#x27;ll turn red very shortly before you arrive). Obviously, you should do this only if traffic permits, but it&#x27;s a great &quot;trick&quot; (not so much a weird one) when you can get from your origin to your destination at a constant speed with nearly no stops.",1443628575

Oh, and also, there&#x27;s a shortage of Americans going into STEM.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the thing, if make it much easier, through regulation, for immigrants or foreign consulting companies to enter the tech market than the legal, medical, or other markets, you should understand you&#x27;ve created an incentive for foreign workers and companies to focus on tech, and US citizens to avoid it.<p>Think of it this way - lemons and avocados are grown in similar conditions.  People can&#x27;t buy lemons for what they used to pay, so the government declares a shortage of lemons.  From now on, lemons will be exempt from the 20% tariff that is placed on avocados, and the government will grant a temporary residency visa to any farmer who wishes to immigrate, provided he agrees to grow lemons only (if he stops growing lemons and tries to grow avocados, he will be deported).<p>You would expect people who already hold US residency rights to move into avocados, and away from lemons, right?<p>But this isn&#x27;t the result of markets, it&#x27;s a market response to severe distortion created by US government policy.<p>I think we&#x27;ve done something much like this in high tech and science/engineering.  The &quot;shortage&quot; of US citizens going into these fields is a rational response to uneven government regulation.<p>This is why I&#x27;m ok with general immigration, but generally opposed to targeted visa programs designed to cure specific &quot;shortages&quot;.  I think that they are almost always used to suppress the wage growth that would draw people into the field and reach market equilibrium.<p>There is data to back this up - the RAND institute, historically a very pro-immigrant think tank, reached the conclusion that US citizens avoid Science and Engineering graduate programs because they are not competitive with the other fields that are available to high achieving students.  But here&#x27;s the thing, those fields are only available to people who already have citizenship!<p><a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html</a>",1443628416

It&#x27;s an old pattern which has been used plenty and we have a pretty good idea of how they work.<p>I don&#x27;t. I used them first over 15 years ago when Haskell was &quot;the next big thing&quot; and I learned it at university. Fact of the matter is that not enough code has been written with them to say that we know how effective they are.<p>> If what you said was true, it wouldn&#x27;t make sense for a hybrid language like Scala to have both. Obviously Scala&#x27;s designers don&#x27;t consider exceptions and Either/Maybe &quot;identical&quot;, do they?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t take lessons from Scala. Scala has inheritance types, sum types, structural types and dynamic types, each can be (and is) used in isolation to solve almost all problems. If there&#x27;s any language with lots of overlapping features, that would be Scala. After all, it&#x27;s a language designed to study various approaches, not to recommend the &quot;best&quot; ones.<p>> You can silence checked exceptions with reckless abandon, but you cannot silence a Maybe just as easily, without resorting to obviously frowned-upon practices<p>You can silence checked exceptions by doing exactly what you&#x27;d be doing to handle Maybe: You need to explicitly handle it. The difference is that you can catch multiple exception types in one block.<p>> For example, checked exceptions are terrible for generic code, composable code.<p>They&#x27;re not. They just don&#x27;t work too well with <i>Java&#x27;s</i> limited effect system of checked exceptions. As a matter of fact, &quot;checked exceptions&quot; are the basis for effect systems in languages like Koka, and are also the basis of transformations of Haskell-ish monads to type-safe nested continuations, which are more appropriate than monads (yet equally expressive and powerful) for imperative languages.<p>Moreover, a system of checked exceptions composes much better than monads do. And you don&#x27;t have to believe me. Phil Wadler says it[1] as does Oleg Kiselyov (who&#x27;s trying to port the same idea back to monadic notation with free monads). This is my own treatment of the subject (which shows how continuations, of which exceptions are a special case, can do monadic composition without monad transformers, and provide type safety through checked exceptions): <a href=""http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2015/08/07/scoped-continuations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2015/08/07/scoped-continuati...</a><p>> I truly don&#x27;t see how you can seriously consider them &quot;identical&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not a question of consideration. Wadler and Filinsky <i>proved</i> them to be the same (each from a different direction). See the link to my post above for the exact references.<p>Still, that&#x27;s not to say that checked exceptions <i>or</i> Maybe are good approaches. We really don&#x27;t have data on the subject. It basically comes down to personal preference.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://cs.au.dk/~hosc/local/LaSC-7-1-pp39-56.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cs.au.dk/~hosc/local/LaSC-7-1-pp39-56.pdf</a>",1443628175

Would love to hear other&#x27;s thoughts on these:<p>- When accelerating, try not to over-extend the throttle. If the engine is at 2k rpm, you get just as much acceleration from 30% throttle as 100%, at half the fuel cost.<p>- Release the throttle well before you reach a traffic light/stop sign. Deceleration by engine will cause a smoother stop and gives the traffic light more time to turn green. You spend less fuel trying to reach the stop line, and spend less fuel accelerating again. Bonus points for shifting down while decelerating.<p>- Keep tires well-inflated and oil levels up. Less friction means less wasted energy on both.<p>- Choose the highest gear when cruising. Most cars since 1990 can do 50kmh (30mph) even in fifth gear, as long as you don&#x27;t need to accelerate.<p>- Drive slower. Most car engines are most efficient around 3500 rpm, which maps to somewhere between 90-110 kmh (60-70mph). Most highways allow for a higher speed. Diesel engines have their optimum at 2000 rpm, or so I&#x27;ve been told.<p>Of course most of this works best with a stick shift. I&#x27;ve never driven an automatic.",1443628050

I don&#x27;t think full Idris a logic, only the\npure sublanguage (please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), so you loose the coincident between programs and proofs. That probably means\nthat there is some &quot;encoding tax&quot; when reasoning about stateful\ncomputation.  The more complicated the effects the higher the encoding\ntax. Just imagine you&#x27;d have to reduce full concurrency\n(e.g. pi-calculus) to lambda-calculus. That would be painful.<p><pre><code>    It is perfectly possible to program in them like you would in a normal language.\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true with current systems.

But that doesn&#x27;t address the key\npoint: (1) you can always do the same with program logic, prove that\nyou don&#x27;t need a cast, but more imporantly (2) in a lot of large-scale\nprogramming projects, you don&#x27;t have good specifications\nup-front. Instead you have a vague idea, and try to knock out a\nprototype as soon as possible to show to the customer, who will\ntypically then reply &quot;that&#x27;s not quite what I want instead ...&quot; and\nyou go back to the drawing board and iterate. The <i>specifications</i> and\nthe program coevolve. In prototype stages you don&#x27;t actually care if\nthe program needs a cast or not, you just put in the simplest thing\nthat works, and fix/optimise later, probably only after heavy\nprofiling. Who cares if a missing-cast exception is thrown during the\nprotoptye phase? And for large projects the prototyping phase might\nalready involve a team of 50 programmers.  Since good specifications\nare typically only available at the end of a project, when the\nsoftware is stable, it only really makes sense to pay the (currenly\nenormous) cost of full verification at the end of the project. With program logic you can easily\ndelay verification until the end of the project (but don&#x27;t have to),\nwith Curry-Howard based verification you can&#x27;t.<p><pre><code>    Two, type system researchers promote provably correct programming as the advantage of dependent types.\n</code></pre>\nProgram logic researchers promote provably correct programming as the advantage of program logic. Anyway,\nprograms can only be provably correct w.r.t. to a specification, but\nin most programming projects, a meaningful specification is not\navailable in the early stages, so any talk about provable correctness is inapplicable.<p><pre><code>    they generalize a vast swath of different type system features \n</code></pre>\nI fully agree with you here, and it&#x27;s beautiful.

Get a user from the UK and you&#x27;ll have to undo all this anyways.<p>Not to mention the complaint in parent&#x27;s comment, that you can no longer copy/paste, plus the inclusion of javascript to skip to the next box (or the lack thereof) is confusing from a UX perspective.<p>Allow phone numbers to be entered in any format in a simple text box.<p>If you want, apply formatting after the fact based on the country, though I think this is even not a good idea. In some cases, the phone number won&#x27;t be from the same country as the user (with VoIP and mobile, phone number locality is no longer a thing).

Throwing people repeatedly from one district to another, so they don&#x27;t have time to learn the issues relevant to their district and the record of their representatives, will exacerbate the problem.<p>Second, the system can be gamed. It looks to me like approving or denying the construction of a large apartment complex near the center of a city can be used as a tool to push lines one direction or another. So approving that big apartment building in the city will increase population in that region, tending to tighten the angle made around it, thus freeing some voters from that district and pushing them into a neighboring one.

It&#x27;s very common in modern cars to have much shorter brake pedal travel, so what would bring you to a gentle stop in an older car will be somewhat more abrupt in a modern car.<p>This is achieved by having a shorter travel pedal, which is then heavily assisted by the brake servos so it is not horribly heavy to apply. This is nominally for safety&#x27;s sake, as it reduces the time between seeing a obstacle and the brakes being fully applied. And since all recent cars have anti-lock braking and stability systems it doesn&#x27;t matter so much if the driver can&#x27;t control the braking pressure quite as precisely.<p>> I suppose you could have a more clever system that would move the brake faster until it touches the disc and then behave normally but I suppose that for such a critical system constructors and regulators are very conservative.<p>Exactly, as I mentioned to the other commenter, it&#x27;s preferable to have a simple, non powered mechanical system in place to stop the car in the event of bad things happening. Adding extra bits to this system, with the vast R+D cost involved, for marginal increases in fuel economy would be hard to justify for most car manufacturers (especially since the fuel economy saving would benefit the users pockets, not theirs).",1443626399

If the first time you go to Pluto to get data it takes 6 months and the second time it takes 30 years, because of complications, it&#x27;s still constant time.<p>If you were accessing a linked list stored on Pluto, then you&#x27;re going to Pluto a number of times depending on how deep in the linked list your data is, assuming it&#x27;s a dumb probe and it can&#x27;t figure out where to go once it gets to Pluto and has to come back to earth to figure out what to do next. (go back to Pluto)<p>If it turns out retrieval time matters, or other factors besides the size of the input, then you can&#x27;t approximate over them and Big-O ceases to be useful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LandauSymbols.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LandauSymbols.html</a>",1443626202

As far as I know, the V2 was the first use of the PIGA.  Descendants of the V2 guidance systems were used by the Apollo moon missions and several US intercontinental ballistic missiles.<p>The PIGA is actually a pretty cool piece of machinery.  You have a free-swinging balance arm that has a mass and a gyroscope on it.  The gyroscope&#x27;s axis of rotation is aligned with the balance arm.  An electric motor spins the whole balance arm in a direction perpendicular to both the gyroscope&#x27;s axis of rotation and the axis about which the balance is free to rotate.  So if you remember from Freshman physics, you have a rotational momentum and an applied torque, the resultant torque is the cross product of the two (in other words, a torque in the direction the balance moves freely).  An analog controller keeps the electric motor spinning at a rate that keeps the balance beam level.  So, the rate the electric motor is turning is proportional to acceleration in the direction of the electric motor&#x27;s axis.  Thus, the integral of the acceleration is proportional to the integral of the rotational velocity of the electric motor.  In other words, the number of revolutions of the electric motor is proportional to the velocity of the rocket (relative to free-fall).  A simple revolution counter is sufficient to cut off the engine&#x27;s fuel flow once the rocket has reached a given velocity.<p>(Source: I interned at Draper Lab, which made the Apollo guidance systems and several ICBM guidance systems.  I walked by an Apollo PIGA in a display case every morning.)",1443625468

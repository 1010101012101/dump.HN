For one, it's unlikely your site/app will ever be as big as RapGenius. That's not a shot, just reality. They ran into problems as an edge case. Is Heroku and their architecture at fault? Hell yeah it is, but I have faith that they will fix it.<p>Why?<p>Because I really think that when push comes to shove, Heroku was actually trying to do the right thing with the changes they made and perhaps didn't consider or understand some of the ramifications of the changes they made to the Rails community. They may have fallen in love a little too much with the new node.js hotness and the like. Their CORE audience is startups/new business where Rails is very popular and they understand what this has done to their reputation. If they don't address this in a serious way it will damage their business severely.<p>I don't personally use Heroku but I have used it in the past and would not hesitate to use it on an appropriate project.",1361001580

5230829,comment,5230259,5230755,2,0,will_brown,,,"With liability protection you want two forms of protection.  The Founder(s) needs to be personally protected from the company liabilities, and you want to company to remain protected from the liabilities of the Founder(s).<p>For example if you form a ""single member"" LLC, or a LLC with 1 owner, because LLCs are partnerships Court's will not protect the LLC from the single Owner's liabilities because there are no partners to justify protecting the business.  So if the Owner has debts, the creditors can go after the  the LLC as a asset to cover the debt.<p>So while anyone can set up an LLC easily on their own, as in this hypothetical it would have been worth the money to talk to an attorney before forming and have the lawyer advise to and another second owner and receive protection with the LLC or form a corporation instead of an LLC as a single owner.",1361001440

Not enough experience with ember.js to comment.<p>Common gotchas for angular:
It's a very different approach when compared to using jquery for everything. The documentation can seem a bit daunting at first, as described in the popular post about why discourse chose ember.js.<p>""The documentation was simple to understand<p>Heres some text right out of the Angular.JS guides, about a feature called Transclusion.<p>'The advantage of transclusion is that the linking function receives a transclusion function which is pre-bound to the correct scope.

This makes it possible for the widget to have private state, and the transclusion to be bound to the parent (pre-isolate) scope.'"" - <a href=""http://eviltrout.com/2013/02/10/why-discourse-uses-emberjs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eviltrout.com/2013/02/10/why-discourse-uses-emberjs.h...</a><p>A lot of these problems are solved by the excellent tutorial videos at <a href=""http://www.egghead.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.egghead.io</a> though.

5230821,comment,5230259,5230611,3,0,tnicks,,,"<i></i>This is not legal advice<i></i>*<p>I agree with the sentiment of your edit but would like to expand.<p>The key factor in an early stage company structural organization should be external risk reduction in relation to the founders and seed investors (they are already taking plenty of risk) while providing maximum return and <i>low compliance</i> costs.  An LLC provides for this.  If ""institutional"" investors come along then a change to a C-corp is trivial and low cost (when discussing securities sales it is almost non-existent if you are already selling LLC unit securities).  The motivation being that the VC/Institutional investors are subject to a different tax structure if they buy units as opposed to shares (due to pass-through).  So re-organizing as a result of an offer is completely reasonable in my opinion, just be upfront in discussions.  This allows the LLC seed investors to take maximum profit and minimum risk during the pre-VC stage.<p>If you wish to contribute more to the business while organized as an LLC you can simply increase distribution percentage and have investors (yourself included) buy more Units (this eventuality must be prepared for in the original organization by providing enough units).  And yes there is an element of ""sales"" to this with the current investors but if they bought in once and you paid them they should buy in again.",1361001299

In the meantime, I redid the backend for a 100,000 user website, wrote one of the top Haskell tutorials on the web, launched 2 products for a financial software startup, founded a company, pivoted said company 4 times, watched said company die, ported Arc to JavaScript, and learned a whole lot about programming, startups, and myself.  I did eventually have a chance to be a cofounder of a YC startup (not by applying the normal way, but because PG put me in touch with one of the applicants in SFP08 that needed a technical cofounder and they offered me 20% of the company), but by then I'd realized that it wasn't really what I wanted at that point in my life.  If the need arises, I'll apply again, but by now I've realized that my drive is to innovate and I don't care whether that happens in a big company or a startup.<p>I'd like to think of YC as something like the SATs, APs, or patent applications.

Consistent hashing on the app name could do the trick, or DNS tricks on the app names mapping to different routing subshards.<p>(2) Enable dynos to refuse requests, perhaps by refusing a connect or returning an error or redirect that tells a router to try the next dyno. (There are some indications a 'try another' logic already exists in their routers, so it might even be possible for customers to do this without Heroku's help. I have a question in with Heroku support about which request-shedding techniques might work without generating end-user visible errors.)<p>Both could potentially benefit from some new per-dyno load-monitoring features... which would also allow other more-sophisticated (but more costly and fragile at scale) balancing or load-shedding strategies.<p>I can see the commentariat lynch mob is out, but definitive recommendations and fixes take time.

At some point, the load balancing no longer kicks in, because for any real-world application the total workload is finite.

5230784,comment,5230259,5230259,2,0,will_brown,,,"<i>This is not legal advice.<p>The article focuses on a very small tax issue that should not be determinative of business structure.   The way a Start-up should decide to form a business generally should be as follows:<p>1.  State - generally always choose the State the Founder is physically located.  If you choose Delaware or another State you are not physically located, you must ""qualify"" your business to do business in every State you have a physical presence - failure to qualify may negate any protections offered by the business structure.<p>2.  Structure -(Corp (S or C) vs LLC) This is determined on a two part analysis: First, I start with liability, CPAs typically only look at the tax issue, you want to ensure the Founder(s) will not be liable for business debts and the business can not be liable for Founder's personal debts.  Example, I would always advise against a ""single member"" LLC because an LLC is considered a Partnership, thus Courts will not enforce Partnership protection where there are no Partners (ie, single member) and the LLC can be liable for Founder's personal debts - on the other hand a CPA will usually recommend single member LLCs because they are taxed like a sole proprietorship(make filing taxes really easy).  Second, should be the tax issue, if multiple Founders I suggest LLC, especially when there are foreign Founders, if it is a single Founder then I suggest Corp. and S status if qualified.<p>3.  Cost- This should never be determinative but taken into consideration.  The cost of forming/qualifying Corp and LLC can vary greatly among the States.  Additionally, compliance (annual reports, state taxes) among the States can vary as greatly as well as the cost of compliance and the penalties for failure to timely file can be very costly.<p></i><i></i>I know the word in SV is that Start-ups must be C-Corps incorporated in Delaware in order to receive funding.  My thought is that if a Start-up is already incorporated/organized and has not received funding the Founders can easily: 1. ""Domesticate"" their business entity to Delaware, if an LLC perform a Conversion to a C-Corp., or 2.

They knew what the problem was for three years; it was only when a big customer went very public that they adopted the right tone and action plan.<p>I imagine there's great discomfort inside Heroku these days because somewhere between the line engineers who knew about this issue, and the CEO, the fact that customers were complaining was swallowed up.",1360998299

You are essentially subject to all manner of ridiculous punishment for what would be considered minor or non-offenses in most free countries. Most of their elections are uncontested.

Division of labor is the foundation of civilization.  I don't try to fly my own 737, diagnose my own diseases, or try to filter propaganda and fact check issues I have no context for or experience with.

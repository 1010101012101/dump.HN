4078515,comment,4077891,4078044,2,0,nulluk,,,"I wouldn't recommend having the ""pretty"" part not validated. It can cause some serious issues with google & duplicate content and if someone wants to be malicious they can create a bunch of fake urls that essentially point to the same page, or even worse if they receive enough links they can be indexed at the new ""fake"" url. A similar thing happened to a newspapers website but I can't recall who of the top of my head.<p>Another potential solution & my preferred method is whenever a change is made that would affect the url of a page. Update a ""legacy"" table with the old url and the location of the new url, next time a 404 is going to be thrown do a search against the database & redirect accordingly if a new url is found.
I rolled this approach into <a href=""https://github.com/leonsmith/django-legacy-url"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/leonsmith/django-legacy-url</a> and whilst it's not polished it's by far the easiest & probably most automatic/maintainable solution I have found.",1339070374

Basically, you hard code a list of salts and a list of hash function names (which could also be automatically generated by a tool), and it gives you a new hash function which is the composition of those other functions. There's no reason for everyone to try to do it by hand and risk messing it up in some simple way. And if there were an easy to use framework for doing it, there would be no reason for only larger sites to use it.

4078472,comment,4077431,4077829,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think this hyper-""ironic"" everything-bashing when it comes to innovation is a very low variety of discourse.<p>It's true that most of these social media startups are overvalued garbage that are going to prove themselves to be career graveyards (or sandtraps, at the least) when the tide goes out. And the people who join these unimaginative VC darlings for 0.02% of the pie (with preferences against that equity) are going to lose big time. That said, the reflexive ""<X> isn't a real innovation"" attitude when X is the solution to a real problem (e.g. self-driving cars, fraud detection, or even well-designed smart-phone interfaces) is a bit annoying. It may not be the flying car, but this X is usually something that came out of a lot of hard work on a problem that's just much more difficult than it seems it ""should"" be.<p>I think there's a resentment that builds in a lot of people due to a discrepancy between the real forces that produce technological improvements and the popular press. Reality: technological innovation is slow and incremental, with one seemingly insignificant change making another step possible, and that making another step feasible... until there is eventual macroscopic change, over time. It's gradual and, on the surface, doesn't appear that interesting. Popular depiction, for a contrast: visionary businessmen and ""technologists"" and ""hackers"" are driving the future. The backlash against that is that people single out these ""visionaries"" (many of whom are overrated) and denigrate everything they've accomplished as ""not a real innovation"". There's truth in the matter of these ""visionaries"" being overrated, but on the other hand, that doesn't mean that technological progress isn't happening. It's just gradual and unpredictable, and often fails to emerge where we want it. Technological progress actually <i>pushes</i> through on its own terms, rather than being <i>pulled</i> where wanted. For example, human transportation has been stagnant in price and quality (in the US) since 1960. That's a real morale problem on a national scale. But to single out Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg as ""not real innovators"" because they haven't cured cancer or delivered $40 worldwide airfares is a big of a leap.",1339069456

4078372,comment,4073279,4078280,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"You seem misinformed about multiple issues.<p>First, while it's certainly true that people of every age have complained about the past, it's also true that some ages were really shitty. Rome went through several really bad emperors, for instance. If we are to learn anything from history, we should learn that there exist signs that we are entering an age of tyranny. It's fine to debate what they are, or whether they are prevalent today, but it's not okay just to toss out any observation about the way things currently are with ""yeah but people always complain like this"" That's a pretty scary throwaway.<p>Second, and most tragically, the more laws we have <i>the more the police have the ability to selectively choose</i>. You seem to have it backwards. In a society with a few laws, if the cops bust you they have to pick one random one and try to make it fit. In a society with complicated, diverse, and sometimes conflicting laws, they have a lot more options over how to send you to jail, and it's more likely that one of these options will fit. In the states, for instance, we've made it a felony to lie to a federal official in the progress of his duties. That's so broad and free-ranging that even with an attorney present it's not clear what citizens should do to be sure they are not crossing the line into committing a major crime. The police get to decide. Likewise, many states are choosing not to enforce marijuana laws -- a stance I agree with -- but the national government is constantly enforcing them anyway. At a certain level of complexity, it's all about <i>which</i> laws get attention from officials and which don't.<p>It might seem that creating a more complex system of laws is a natural consequence of having a more complex and modern society. That's also a fallacy, as complex societal interactions have been working just fine with few laws for recorded history. However, the reverse is true: when a certain degree of complexity is reached, society actually becomes much more simple. Once the system is not understandable to the common man, police can do what they want, prosecutors can pick and choose which laws to enforce or not, and politically-connected people get to live like kings.<p>It is easy to think that each law we add somehow makes the world a more just and fair place to live in, but that's only because in our mind we pretend that this law will be applied universally. Authorities have long since passed the point where laws are applied universally. To hear and get excited about a new set of laws now is simply to desire to enforce one set of laws at the expense of another (we are never told which laws will be receiving less enforcement action). It's a way for politicians to get elected, not make society a more just place.<p>All of this is counter-intuitive, I'll grant. But it's not like it's a secret.",1339067134

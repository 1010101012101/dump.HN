What will happen if I exceed 250 GB of data usage in a month?<p>The vast majority - more than 99% - of our customers will not be impacted by a 250 GB monthly data usage threshold. If you exceed more than 250 GB, you may receive a call from the Customer Security Assurance (""CSA"") team to notify you of excessive use.  At that time, we will tell you exactly how much data you used.  When we call you, we try to help you identify the source of excessive use and ask you to moderate your usage, which the vast majority of our customers do voluntarily.  If you exceed 250GB again within six months of the first contact, your service will be subject to termination and you will not be eligible for either residential or commercial internet service for twelve (12) months.  We know from experience that most customers curb their usage after our first call.  If your account is terminated, after the twelve (12) month period expires, you may resume service by subscribing to a service plan appropriate to your needs.<p>They say they will help you identify the reason you went over your cap. ""When we call you, we try to help you identify the source of excessive use and ask you to moderate your usage, which the vast majority of our customers do voluntarily."" Which they clearly didn't do in this case. This would be acceptable if we had another option for broadband internet, but we don't.",1310601586

Is it a problem that I walked by an old friend at a restaurant and didn't realize we knew each other? Oh, there's an iPhone app for that!? There is a difference between satisfying a market and actually solving what is to be considered a real life problem. I do think the current nature of the valley is that of ""Wouldn't it be cool if I could..."" rather than ""My life would be substantially better off if I could..."" I suspect this is what she is trying to highlight.<p>So this begs the real question - what do we consider to be real life problems? For an upper class American a problem may be that you were unable to figure out the name of the last song played on the radio and for poor villagers in Africa it's having no access to water. Is solving one person's problem more advantageous than another?",1310601495

At least, I can't think of any that produced companies with impact on par with the founders-stay-for-the-long-haul companies: Microsoft, Intel, Sun, Google, Dell, nVidia, etc. Apple is an almost-example; both founders were gone in less than a decade, but the general consensus seems to be that the post-founder management didn't run it well.<p>It's hard to imagine counterfactuals properly, but I can't imagine any of those turning out better if the founders had left within, say, a 5-7-yr exit timeframe.

Why do consumer ISPs need to charge so much more?</i><p>The ISP has to maintain and upgrade thousands of miles of physical plant to deliver data to customer's homes in the geographic regions they cover. For a typical cable ISP for instance there's about 3-5 miles of copper between your modem and the the fiber node and typically dozens of miles between the fiber node and the provider's headend/datacenter where they uplink to the Internet -- which incidentally for smaller rural ISPs may itself be hundreds of miles away from competitive rates on data. Going back to the cost of maintaing/upgrading the infrastructure a small plant of only ~1000 miles typically requires at least a dozen full time employees simply to maintain it day to day and that's not including things like management, network engineers, customer service, technical support, equipment, contracted labour, customer installation, etc. On top of that you've got the cost of leasing access to the poles/underground conduits and the cost of powering the 3-5 miles of plant plus whatever operational costs you have to put gas into your fleet of vehicles, the cost of the vehicles themselves, insurance, etc. When you put this all together you're looking at some pretty huge overhead on the consumer side of Internet access plus whatever profit the company wants to make to justify all of the above.

PG tries evoking an emotional response out of the reader, pulling some random unsupported facts out of nowhere, like a religious preacher who'll do anything to support his point of view.

That would be a $100,000 payday with a billion readers where 99% of the people didn't even think it was funny.<p>The secret truth that Brad captured (way before it was well known too) is that the <i>rate</i> at which a pure information company can earn money is essentially <i>unlimited.</i> Not a lot of people could imagine Brad's scenario, they got bogged down in the details like ""gee processing the payment would cost more than a penny"" or ""how do you force them to pay a penny"" or whatever. But now Google comes along and capitalizes on <i>exactly</i> that idea, except that rather than have the users click on something if they think its funny, they have someone click on something if they think it may be an answer to their question, and rather than processing them one penny at a time, Google gathers those clicks and just does an accounting transaction which becomes an actual payment once a month for the aggregate transaction. But they don't <i>make</i> anything, rather they convert an action into money, and they do that at web scale. No limit to how much money they can generate. So from an investment value, they have a very very large rate of return. The actual limit is how much money advertisers are willing to inject into the system.<p>So if you have a company whose revenue is only limited by the amount of money its 'customers' are willing to inject, and you can make a credible case for the fact that customers will be willing to inject $100M+ per year into the system, then you can make the argument that the company is 'worth' a billion dollars. (or multiple billions of dollars).<p>So while I agree with the unspoken criticism that some recent valuations seem high based on available information, if those valuations are coming from folks who have done their due diligence then I expect they have some line of reasoning that justifies that value to their own satisfaction. In the 'individual investor' bubble of the late 90's it was clear that individual investors were doing no diligence at all.",1310600453

You can't hope to raise money from things that are more than one hop away from things that they know.<p>And lastly, innovation from a startup's perspective, is almost never a brilliant flash of insight. It's usually a gradual iterative process of discovery and learning that looks like a brilliant flash of insight in hindsight, especially to people re-telling the story. Everyone wants to hear about what was going on when the meteoric rise was happening (relatively short time), as opposed to all the time spent laying the ground work and exploration and deadends beforehand (relatively long time). You can only hope to do iterative discovery before breaking the ground somewhere. What the author complains about lack of innovation is really just what innovation looks like on the ground--feeling around in the dark. You have a better chance of finding something if you work from where you know, rather than just taking a giant hop. And really, innovation is never immediately obvious. It usually is just an inkling--a tickle.<p>On a macro level, innovation has flashes in the number of people that are working on it.

They're all slightly different ways of doing Groupon, and none of them at this point look like they're offering any significant advantage over eachother.  They may be more or less sustainable or profitable than Groupon, but they aren't game changers in the sense that Google was.<p>She wasn't complaining that startups have exits, she was complaining that startups are being <i>designed</i> around exits.  None of the counter-examples you listed, nor any established company that anyone can name off hand, was designed for an exit.  You can look at the guys who did <s>gmail</s> Google Maps* or Youtube and say yes, they got a good exit, but both companies were designed to do something new, and their exit followed from that.  A lot of startups these days seem to be designed to show off design skills and the ability to write an app, rather than actually do something unique and useful.<p>Which brings me to your last point. Writing Basic interpreters for hobbyists wasn't trivial in the sense that the author meant.  Finding a cupcake or sharing a photo is trivial: it doesn't much change anyone's life, and it's been done a thousand times before.  It's trivial in the sense that a fart app for the iPhone is trivial.  Microsoft's innovation was not that it could write basic interpreters, as people wrote basic interpreters for new architectures all the time.  Their innovation was that they were an independent software firm who contracted their services out to hardware manufacturers.  This is how they came to land the DOS contract with IBM that catapulted them to success.  That innovation was as big as the innovation where someone first said, ""why are we hosting this on a server in the basement?  Why don't we throw it up on some server <i>out there</i> that doesn't care where we are or what device we're using to access it?""<p>If you look at any of the big tech companies around today, they got their start by doing something either a) no one had done before, or b) an order of magnitude better than anyone had ever done it.  Most of the startups you see today don't make any effort at a) or b), but they are c) designed to be flipped in a talent acquisition.

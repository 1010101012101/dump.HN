That is not the case. Perpetuating that fallacy actually helps interrogators, since the fear of &quot;confess or else you&#x27;ll get the wrench&quot; is implanted in people&#x27;s minds. Since that is not how things actually work, it is counter productive. It does not help anyone except the authorities. This is why I say stop perpetuating the fallacy. Seriously.",1387335544

How about an after school &quot;chess club&quot; where the kids who attend get free dinner, and there are a variety of educational activities to choose from in addition to chess? How about a free camp where you bus all the kids out to the nearest wilderness every weekend to learn archery and play sports, and the kids who attend don&#x27;t have to worry about not having food and shelter for two days out of the week?<p>> What if the tagger chooses not to go?<p>Not all of them have to go. You don&#x27;t have to solve the entire problem at the same time.

I&#x27;ll pick something for you.  Let&#x27;s say you are a Personal Chef.<p>Let&#x27;s say I am someone who needs a Personal Chef.<p>I put up an ad on Craigs List.<p>You show up and seem to be qualified.<p>I offer you $3 per hour.<p>You are probably going to tell me to go fuck myself.<p>I then offer you $8 per hour.<p>Same response.<p>$10 per hour?<p>$15 per hour?<p>$25 per hour?<p>$50 per hour?<p>You want $75.  I say, I won&#x27;t go more than $50 until I know that you can cook.  That will take 90 days.  After that I agree to raise your hourly rate by $5 per quarter until we get to $75 per hour.<p>Ah, we have a deal.<p>You see, I can&#x27;t force you to work for me for any wage other than what you are willing to accept for the job at hand.  We have to agree on a number that works for both of us.<p>Not one business, manager or business owner is forcing any person to come to their establishment every day and work for any wage whatsoever.  At least not in the US.  People seek out these jobs, apply for them and then go to work every day.<p>Not a living wage?  Don&#x27;t take the job!  Don&#x27;t blame it on the business.  Don&#x27;t take the job!  Go find a job where your skill set will result in higher wages!  How can this possibly be the business&#x27;s fault in any imaginable reality?  Do. Not. Take. The. Job.<p>Ah, no choice because you have no marketable skills?  Who&#x27;s fault is that?  How can that possibly be any business&#x27;s fault?<p>Your &quot;artificially low prevailing wage&quot; is imaginative utter nonsense.  The only thing that is artificial is forcing a wage floor on all businesses regardless of market realities.<p>It is precisely this kind of government meddling that PUSHES jobs out of the country.<p>In your reality people flipping burgers in Los Angeles would make $25 per hour (barely a &quot;living wage&quot; in Los Angeles by some measures) and Big Mac would cost $35, fries another $10.  Guess what?  In that reality you are going to have robots running McDonald&#x27;s because NOBODY is going to pay those prices.  All those people who would be flipping burgers at a market rate are going to be out of work and possibly on some kind of a government social program.  In other words:  The very concept is nothing but insane.  You don&#x27;t create jobs by destroying the ability of businesses to hire people.  You create jobs by letting the market function without interference from those who don&#x27;t have a clue as to how the real world works.<p>I know you are going to claim that McDonalds can still make money while paying more.  Really? Based on what?  Do you own a fast food franchise?  I know at least two people who do within walking distance from my house.  Profits are thin.  Very thin.  Only restaurants that benefit from incredible locations have a little breathing room.  Nobody is swimming in money.<p>I&#x27;ve bootstrapped and launched a number of businesses.  I&#x27;ve created lots of jobs, from receptionists and warehouse workers to highly paid software and hardware engineers.  Before that I&#x27;ve held jobs all the way from $4.00 per hour to $250K per year.  I&#x27;ve been on both sides of the equation.<p>The ignorance of people who present views such as yours never fails to get my blood pressure up.  You, sir, have no fucking clue what you are talking about.  Go start a business in your garage with your own money and grow it to twenty or thirty people.  Then we can talk.  Until then, please don&#x27;t think that what you are constructing in your mind is even remotely similar to what happens in the real world.<p>Yes, a little rough.  So be it.

6925552,comment,6922405,6923453,51,0,NamTaf,,,"Bullshit. The whole process this guy went through to report on the state of affairs is valuable because it puts the depth of reality on what is otherwise a known but relatively abstract situation. We all know that the judicial system is unfair in an abstract sense, but without seeing actual, real-life examples it does not get driven home nearly as strongly.<p>This article has good parallels with the NYT reporters who feigned being asylum seekers to travel to Australia by boat and document the horrible treatment experienced at all stages by those who take this journey [1]. I could easily imagine you arguing that these NYT reporters were terrible because they could have been on board a boat that sank and caused search and rescue people to go out and waste their time trying to find them. Equally, I could imagine you arguing that they denied a few genuine asylum seekers the room on a boat and therefore they&#x27;re still stuck in a dangerous situation. However, that&#x27;s completely missing the point.<p>The point is that without people undertaking these experiences and documenting them, the harsh reality of the situation is never quite realised. You don&#x27;t end up humanising the debate around how these situations are handled, so people show less empathy towards the situation. This is a terrible situation to be in, because we then forget that we&#x27;re dealing with actual human beings and not just nameless, inert objects.<p>In the case of the judicial system, it&#x27;s one thing to know that the system mistreats and punishes people but it&#x27;s another thing to actually hear the stories about the diabetic being denied proper medical treatment because of some power-tripping guard. That&#x27;s why you had to go out of your way to clarify that you weren&#x27;t justifying their ill treatment of him - it was humanised and put into real-world context.<p>In the case of the asylum seeker report, it&#x27;s pretty widely known that they experience harrowing conditions and receive pretty repulsive treatment by the various governments in an effort to deter their coming to Australia. But without actually hearing the stories of the hopeful children excited about the journey as they kill time in a refugee safehouse playing in the pool with literal spare parts of broken equipment as toys, or the blind hope of the guy wanting to make a better future for his kids whilst simultaneously denying to himself that he won&#x27;t just be chucked in a jail on a third world island, you don&#x27;t experience the same empathy for their situation.<p>It&#x27;s a direct counter to the rhetoric used to de-humanise the whole situation. In the case of asylum seekers, they go from being &#x27;asylum seekers&#x27; to &#x27;boat people&#x27; because the thought of turning away people fleeing some war-torn hellhole to find a better life is harder than turning away a few people who decide one day to hop on a boat to &#x27;jump the queue&#x27;. The re-humanising of the whole argument through actual stories and events is the strongest way to put some emphathy back in to the argument and highlight that we are in fact dealing with other human beings, capable of thinking for themselves and having their own families and loved ones.<p>In the case of the judicial system, it&#x27;s that these people are criminals who exist in some isolated void without family or former childhoods or any of that and simply must be dealt with so that they can&#x27;t commit another crime, rather than humans with a story and a life larger than the crime they allegedly committed. Hell, the author himself said that when he was practicing, he always assumed he was trying actual guilty criminals and that once they&#x27;d been dealt with, it was all over. It was only afterwards that he started wondering about the broader implications of what he was doing.<p>So because of that, I completely reject your statement that it&#x27;s a waste of resources and time to undertake these sorts of investigations. Does it divert theoretical resources away from the ideal task that those resources would be addressing? Sure. But it&#x27;s an extremely valuable use of those resources to highlight the broader issues at play and put some human empathy, so often sorely missing, back in to the debate.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/magazine/the-impossible-refugee-boat-lift-to-christmas-island.html?_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/magazine/the-impossible-re...</a>",1387334412

Basically, the power of the radar return is affected by the interaction of the radar waves with the irregularities in the water surface (<a href=\"https://earth.esa.int/applications/data_util/SARDOCS/spaceborne/Radar_Courses/Radar_Course_III/bragg_scattering.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://earth.esa.int/applications/data_util/SARDOCS/spacebo...</a>).  To get a wind speed and direction from the radar power, you have to hit the surface from several different angles and perform an inversion.<p>There are several ocean winds space missions that do this continuously from ~90-minute Earth orbits.

A 514 could reproduce a deck of punch cards[2] at 100 cards/minute.

The expansion of the money supply is inflation. Prices going up is merely a potential symptom of inflation.<p>Inflation does in fact harm the poor dramatically more so than anybody else. They&#x27;re the most susceptible to rising prices, their incomes rise the slowest, and they have no capital or assets to leverage to keep pace with inflation through hedges (such as stocks, gold, commodities in general, housing, etc).<p>Incomes do not inherently go up hand in hand with prices. In fact it&#x27;s the exact opposite, the greater the inflation the less able incomes are to keep pace. America is dramatic proof of that over the last 40 years, as the cost of major goods such as housing, education and healthcare have vastly outstripped gains in income.<p>Your theory that wages inherently keep up with inflation assumes that there are no spin-off consequences to inflation, that&#x27;s blatantly not correct. It generates a downward spiral, cascade effect; just ask Argentina how that works, their economy has been getting hammered by it the last few years. As you expand the money supply, devalue your currency and generate inflation, all sorts of costs from external sources begin to climb, such as the cost of imports (raw goods like plastic or steel, completed goods like toasters, commodities etc). This one effect alone guarantees domestic wages can never keep pace with inflation.<p>Inflation also destroys savings, and the poor always have the smallest base of savings to begin with, and are least able to shift their savings into higher yielding investments.<p>There are numerous recent examples from around the world where inflation outstrips wage gains.<p>Brazil is an obvious recent example of it, the cost of goods in Brazil is outrageous, and was one of the reasons for their recent riots. The high inflation there, requiring incredible interest rates to fight, has far outstripped their wage gains. Venezuela and Argentina are two other recent examples of it. And there are extreme examples of it, in which the people of a country have been wiped out by inflated prices while their incomes did not keep up (Zimbabwe is an easy example of that).",1387333256

The media circus doesn&#x27;t have a lot of rewards in it these days, and can be safely ignored: better to put on the blinders, and work overtime pushing your own legacy, your own horse. Refuse to become entangled with a quagmire of the past, and work towards making sure your by fiat dictums have some tiny sliver of a prayer of making it through reality&#x27;s brutal thresher.",1387332260

I suspect if those massive servers acted as BitTorrent permaseeds the result would be even faster because the peers could contribute additional bandwidth.",1387332220

But this is solely the role of the government, and private charity<p>This is how the system currently functions, but I strongly believe the system needs to (and must) change. For a business to purely be concerned with profit can only lead to destruction for all of us. They&#x27;ll bleed workers dry, kill the planet and be happy doing it.",1387332182

HyperDex seems closest to Redis with lists/maps/sets, except that it&#x27;s distributed and fully consistent (i.e. what Redis could dream of being some day).  None of those are easy to write, and many people already find them quite useful in production.  Stop being flat-out wrong about everything, and do some research.",1387332127

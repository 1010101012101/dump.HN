Picking out a few at random:<p><i>Presentation Consulting - Teach companies how to improve their presentations</i><p>That's not a bad idea. Is somebody already doing it? Possibly, but that doesn't mean you can't do it too.<p><i>Online flower shop with one-hour delivery</i><p>Sounds tricky, and you'd need to restrict it to a couple of major and dense cities, but again there's no reason it's not a viable business. Market it correctly by encouraging men to send their ladies flowers spontaneously, and you could surely make some money.<p><i>Build Your Own Back Pack Shop</i><p>Damn you, random numbers! I don't much like this idea, but there's gotta be somebody out there (schoolkids, I guess) who would love to build customized backpacks for themselves. Great idea? No. World changing? No. Profitable if you get the product and the marketing right? Sure!",1307699745

This leaves me highly conflicted.<p>On a very slightly brighter note, they've stopped jailing so many young women for non-payment after a rash of suicides a few years ago.",1307696450

It costs money, but assuming your business generates money (many businesses do) it will probably be more reliable and cost less expensive, expensive you-time than anything else.<p>Otherwise: rsync is your friend.  Run it in daemon mode.  If you've just got a handful of machines I'd nominate one machine as the server to receive all uploads.  Everybody else just syncs their upload directory to that machine's.<p>You may also want to consider offering bittorrent as an option, since this situation appears to be tailor-made for it.",1235894385

I'm pushing probably a few terabytes of data a month now, so to improve speed whilst keeping costs low, I plan to serve files from multiple machines. A mini-CDN if you will.<p>The files will be the same across each distribution server, but I am not sure of the best way to replicate the uploaded files across machines.<p>Example: Someone uploads xyz.tar.gz to Machine #1. I need it replicated, as fast as possible, to Machine #2 and #3, so that when people visit the site, if they get http://cdn-3.mysite.com/, they'll get the file.<p>Does HN have any suggestions as to the best way to go about this?<p>Edit: My files aren't very large, they're maybe 5 gb in total and don't grow too fast, they're just accessed a lot.",1235892602

Interesting how the American government's dramatic intrusions into the credit market have inverted pre-existing systemic signals.",1235892527

I'd make this simpler: switch to linux or call windows and complain if you're up to it. both win without having to sacrifice any actual performance.",1235891460

You'd have to find/download an OEM disk in that case that matches your manufacturer<p>2) You're downloading XP Pro with a SP when you have a key for plain old XP Pro<p>It could always be something else, but these are two (read: common) scenarios I know that have frustrated myself and friends in the past.<p>No more, no more.

I have often thought that a plugin like trackmenot that clicks random ads would be another thing that could destroy advertising.<p>The thing is, people thought ad-skipping technology was unlikely until tivo came out and made it usable. I don't imagine it will be too long before someone comes out and does this, and if they execute well, it would be devastating to the industry.",1235891285

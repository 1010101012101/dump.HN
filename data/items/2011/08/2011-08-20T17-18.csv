If leaves were arranged to optimally harvest solar energy, the tree would need an enormous amount of water to combat the resultant heat and evaporation.<p>Trees only convert 1-3% of the solar energy that falls on them -- so trees are a very poor system to mimic if the goal is to maximize solar energy collection.",1313862547

For example, the head of the UK (if I recall correctly) Pirate Party was taking questions online. I asked him a simple question, along these lines:<p><pre><code>   Right now, piracy is hard for the average person. They have to get
   a bittorrent client, find torrents, deal with poorly labeled or poorly
   ripped content, and so on. It's just easier to go to iTunes or Amazon
   and buy the music.

   Your platform calls for non-commercial file sharing to be completely
   legal.

   If that were implemented, wouldn't file sharing go mainstream? If the
   law says it is OK, that will remove the social stigma that might stop
   some people. PC companies would likely start bundling file sharing
   software, and would contribute to improving said software, to make
   it easy enough for the average consumer.

   File sharing would become the predominant way that music is distributed.

   How, in such a system, would music production be funded?
</code></pre>
His answer was that piracy has been shown to not significantly decrease sales. I pointed out that yes, it might not significantly decrease sales <i>now</i>, because it is difficult and illegal, and iTunes is so convenient. I'm asking about <i>after</i> his policies are implemented, when file sharing is as convenient as buying through iTunes, and as legal. Why would a significant number of people chose to buy through iTunes or Amazon instead of just using the P2P program that was bundled with their PC?<p>His answer: piracy has not been shown to significantly decrease sales.",1313860889

This would not be a recipe to develop good-tasting cakes, even though you probably get some very beautiful cakes made out of styrofoam by people who believe that styrofoam tastes great.<p>Besides giving up the claim that science fairs are more relevant to science than high school orchestras are to music (because, reasonably, a high school orchestra delivering a crappy performance of a virtually unknown piece may still make some kind of contribution), another possibility would be that somewhere between regional and state levels, participants get expert advice on their creation and formally have to factor in the expert advice into a revised version of their experiment.",1313859686

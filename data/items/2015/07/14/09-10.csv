I dabble in Prolog and think a lot about genetic algorithms, neural networks, and other mysteries I may never need for work but that captivate my imagination. I still marvel at the ability to Facetime in realtime with my nieces on the other side of the world who I rarely see, talk for free over VOIP with my 87-year old grandmother thousands of miles away, and instantly learn from fascinating people all over the world who I will never meet in &quot;real life.&quot; These are genuinely magical phenomena for anyone who grew up before most people even had &quot;answering machines&quot; or &quot;vcrs&quot;, and at a time when even a &quot;car phone&quot; seemed like a far-off reality. And I&#x27;m not even that old.<p>But I remember when you could visit a theatre or have dinner and the event of being with others was the point, people sharing the same space and time together, invested in that moment, and the only stimulation from another human was the one in front of you. Each encounter was a shared experience only between those involved. Uninterrupted from the outside, a special depth emerged from these moments.<p>Modern life has mostly removed this. You cannot watch a movie with an audience that is fully involved in it. At a party, many are equally invested in their conversations with those not present as they are with those who are. The energy and attention of our minds is not infinite, and when some of it enters the electronic portal, much less trickles toward those a few feet from you. Even a short check of email has a lingering effect on your mind that lasts longer than the actual disruption.<p>What is the net balance of these new tools? New generations will never understand the equally magical impact of being present in the moment with one or a hundred others, the true &quot;social&quot; experience, free of the distractions of an entire planet that is accessible from our purse or pocket.",1436867625

I personally preferred Kato&#x27;s split pane chat windows and handling of multiple team (which Slack still doesn&#x27;t do right). We also thought it was more competitively priced. After we had made a case internally for team chat, we started a full department trial of Slack, at which point point our users became fairly enamoured with it, and probably unwilling to uproot and change to a new service.<p>I have a feeling this matches the world at large for Slack. By implementing a very personable interface users seem to grow a positive emotional connection to the service. This reflects in their usage which is also positive and casual, encouraged by features like custom emoji. All this comes together into not the most practical and functional features on paper, but definitely the most enrapturing user experience.<p>A good read if you want to learn more about Slack&#x27;s on going world domination: <a href=""https://medium.com/@awilkinson/slack-s-2-8-billion-dollar-secret-sauce-5c5ec7117908"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@awilkinson/slack-s-2-8-billion-dollar-se...</a>",1436867015

9883693,comment,9880438,9880438,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Right now is more or less the worst possible time to plan out a new space telescope. There&#x27;s one simple practical reason, the JWST hasn&#x27;t been launched yet. Once it has then that&#x27;ll end it&#x27;s budget dominance and if it succeeds then it&#x27;ll hopefully start to pump some fresh air back into the space science community, after having sucked most of it up for the past decade with its cost-overruns and schedule slips.<p>But far more important than that are the drastic changes coming to space launch. Reusability is on the horizon, and innovative launch concepts are being tested. Almost assuredly launch capabilities and launch prices 10 years from now will be very different. And that is the primary driver of cost and program complexity when it comes to orbital space telescopes. High launch costs means that spacecraft need to eek out the utmost performance from within tight payload margins, that raises cost. It means there&#x27;s no room for contingencies like backup missions, which raises the stakes. And because the cost and stakes are so high that means the vehicle has to be over-engineered so that it has a very high probability of completing its primary mission, which further increases cost. Even though launch doesn&#x27;t end up being the majority of mission cost, it still has an enormous impact on it.<p>In a decade or so it may be possible to launch payloads at somewhere between half to 1/10th of current costs. Which opens up a whole new vista of opportunities and changes the local cost/benefit maxima sharply. It will likely be possible to build, launch, and operate a Hubble-class telescope for less than a billion dollars, perhaps only a few hundred million dollars. That makes it more feasible to test innovative designs, it makes it easier to launch a fleet of similar or identical telescopes to increase science throughput, and it makes it feasible to simply replace failed telescopes. That may very well change the way we design and build spacecraft, relying more on extra mass instead of bleeding-edge over-engineering to provide longevity and reliability. But it&#x27;ll also provide new insights into orbital telescope design, instrumentation, as well as abundant new science data, all of which will inform next generation telescope design, likely leading in different directions from the designs and budgets we would choose today.",1436866287

9883652,comment,9869755,9872853,0,0,serf,,,"> The biggest issue you aren&#x27;t considering is that the biggest advantage of a gun is that you just have to have it. Power isn&#x27;t shooting someone accurately - it&#x27;s bringing a gun to a knife fight. Having a knife means you have to close to the target to engage - having a gun means I can stand back and project power.<p>Brandishing isn&#x27;t something a gun is for, i&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s an extraordinarily bad idea to use a gun as a tool for threatening a would-be attacker for both your health, and your legal well-being.[0][1]<p>> Furthermore, every firearm made in America in the last century has been certified as drop safe.<p>Single action revolvers have absolutely no safety other than the geometry of their design to prevent accidental discharge and (sometimes) an external safety. Here is the first list of them I found for sale readily on google.[2]<p>Here&#x27;s a list of de-certified firearms [3], I&#x27;d like you to notice the amount of modern guns de-certified just last year for sale for being deemed unsafe (for these varied reasons[4]). I apologize for the CA-centric data, it was just easiest to find.<p>Competition shooting pistols often have absolutely no safety devices at all, and plenty are manufactured within the United States.<p>Many pistols are heirloomed or sold privately, those pistols are not required by law to conform to any safety standards, and can be sold indefinitely. Their high value nature aids the used gun economy, another incentive to have a gun sans modern safeties.[4 :relics and curios/heirloom footnote]<p>> Poppy cock. Modern firearms don&#x27;t just go off [0].<p>Well, here&#x27;s a blog post with enthusiasts arguing over that.[5] I have a few guns that were left to me by the deceased, but I am by no means an enthusiast.<p>Here&#x27;s a blog-post that used wording similar to yours regarding the last century, but he describes drop-safe guns as &#x27;a vast majority&#x27; rather than &#x27;every&#x27;, further explaining about which (modern) guns are never drop-safe.[6]<p>Now, let me say that I sincerely hope that someone who is going to take the effort to arm their house with a gun will do the homework to figure out a safe firearm to do so with, and with the proper training; but we don&#x27;t live in that world. People will grab something convenient, just like anything else in life.

I no longer have time for fantasy but still bet.<p>When playing fantasy NBA against friends, I used various methods of calculating average output and forecasting it against a schedule and then made decisions on when to trade players. That was in a league where player values rose and fell based on their popularity in the system. It can get very time consuming if you want to maximise your chances. The NBL was simpler but someone using a spreadsheet to time trades through the season would always beat those who weren&#x27;t.<p>I bet on the NBL because it&#x27;s not a strong and well-researched market by bookmakers in Australia and I have very good domain knowledge short of advanced statistics (hear a lot of rumours, know players, tendencies, injuries).

My VRBO experiences always involved strange inconsistent booking procedures and calendar management, and the website was clunky and old tech with lots of state-destroying page navigations.  And one thing AirBnB has really nailed is that it can be really important to have great communication between the two parties in the transaction, not only through the mechanics of booking, but through your entire stay.  There&#x27;s a ton of redundancy in communication channels (email/sms/web/phone) for a transaction, and the result is that you never have to say &quot;oh, I need to go run the app to send them a message&quot; or log into a web page (oops I booked this on my desktop and I&#x27;m not logged in on mobile) or look up a phone number or anything like that.  It&#x27;s one big multi-transport conversation that is <i>easy</i> to use, so if you need to communicate, it just happens, rather than being something you have to work for.",1436864876

I think at least Leviathan, Narnia, Behemoth, Utumno and Maze originates from a site I believe had the url wargames.net about 15 years ago. That site got transformed into dievo.org (Digital Evolution) which later closed. intruded.net picked up the wargames to keep them online and they then ended up on overthewire.org.<p>I have very fond memories of hanging around the wargames.net and later dievo.org irc-channels in my late teens talking to the wonderful and talented people there (lots of swedes if I remember correctly). While the late night talks might have messed with my school grades somewhat I&#x27;m pretty sure I learned more from those people than I learned from school anyway. :) I probably wouldn&#x27;t work as a developer today if it weren&#x27;t for those communities so a big shoutout from Woodman if any of you are reading this! :)",1436864742
9883613,comment,9879439,9883216,0,0,byuu,,,"> Including undefined behavior around memory allocation, in particular use-after-free?<p>There are obviously going to be limits to what can be done. If you access beyond memory, you get &quot;bad data&quot; if the address is mapped by the OS, or a crash if it&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s a clear bug, and we can&#x27;t make C a language that is incapable of producing programs with bugs. I don&#x27;t really think of this as &quot;undefined&quot; ... we define very clearly that one of two things happens, based on the OS&#x27; memory layout. That&#x27;s very different from GCC&#x27;s understanding, where undefined == &quot;if I want to have the program upload a cat picture to Reddit instead of shift a signed integer right, then that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do.&quot; (facetious, but you get the idea. Many of GCC&#x27;s &#x27;optimizations&#x27; cause outright security vulnerabilities, and defy all logic, like deleting chunks of code entirely.)<p>We want the most logical thing to happen when a user does something, not a completely unexpected thing just because it happens to make some compiler benchmark test look a little better.<p>> Other forms of UB can mostly be patched up straightforwardly with a clean design<p>I&#x27;m betting there aren&#x27;t any C programmers out there that know 100% of the behaviors that are undefined. I&#x27;ve been programming for 18 years, and I got bit the other day because I had &quot;print(sqlRow.integer(), &quot;, &quot;, sqlRow.integer());&quot; ... where the .integer() call incremented the internal read position. MinGW decided to evaluate the second call first, and then the first one, so my output ended up backward. You may think that one&#x27;s obvious, just like I might think that a shift by more bits than the integer type holds being undefined is obvious, but there are people that would be surprised by both.<p>Stating that function arguments evaluate left-to-right, just like &quot;operator,&quot; does in expressions, would be an infinitesimal speed hit on strange systems, and no speed hit at all on modern systems that can just as easily use an indirect move to set up the stack frame.<p>And if you have a processor that can&#x27;t do arithmetic shift right, which would be <i>extremely</i> rare, then generate that processor&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;((x & m) ^ b) - b&quot; after the shift.",1436864697

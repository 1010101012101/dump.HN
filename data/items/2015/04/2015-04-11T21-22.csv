9360997,comment,9359112,9359972,0,0,pfooti,,,"For what it&#x27;s worth, my gulp build handles both ES6 and Coffee files (although coffee is being phased out it is still present) on both the front (angular) and back (node) ends. It then takes the built files, merges the two streams (as well as any passed-through content from bower etc), and conditionally on development / beta / production sends them through sourcemap, angular-annotate, cat, minify and md5-rev (for cache busting) layers. It also handles injecting correct filenames into index.html and my karma.conf, sorting angular angular files so they&#x27;re catted in dependency order, livereload, restarting the backend server, catching build errors, and quite a bit more. Plus sass, of course. It does this with a live asset server for development or building to static files for production. As a bonus, I also can use gulp to run various other important tasks like my ersatz database migration (rolled my own with node and some raw SQL fles) process.<p>I&#x27;d say: I ended up building all the features I wanted in broccoli as part of a gulp build system. It did not &quot;fall flat&quot;, rather, at the time (about eight months ago), I found broccoli had fallen flat- it didn&#x27;t handle what I wanted, and even when it did it was impossible to do incremental rebuilds (say) of files - change one thing and the whole system rebuilt itself leading to a livereload on * rather than a single changed file. On top of everything else, it was dog-slow on medium-to-large codebases. I understand that this has changed since, but the frustration I had originally getting it to do what I want coupled with the length of time it took to run rebuilds (nobody wants 10k msec builds when the same process elsewhere takes 300msec) made me transition to gulp. I&#x27;m sure broccoli is just fine nowadays, and my read of the emails (I still am watching the repo) seems to indicate that Stefan ironed out a lot of the performance issues around watching and rebuilding (symlinks on OSX, IIRC, were a dog).<p>As I said the first time around: you can do just about anything with gulp or grunt, you just have to DIY. If you happen to enjoy spending some time really getting to know your toolchain, they all end up doing about the same thing, and with grunt and gulp it&#x27;s marginally easier to configure certain aspects of the process.",1428789323

Most people in this position conflate &quot;working&quot; with &quot;producing&quot;, but as many learn, these two are very different.<p>&quot;Working&quot;, &quot;producing&quot;, code grunt-ing, whatever you call it, seems to be what most young folks spend all their time doing in their first few professional years (it&#x27;s what I did too). This is a good thing, it builds a lot of exposure and raw experience. You may be immersed in (or cranking out) code, fixing bugs, or working <i>directly on</i> your project/product for almost your entire work day, every day.<p>But at some point, many re-remember that they must learn and grow to advance in their field, and with that comes reading, exploring, trying/failing, as well as non-technical work, like planning/architecting, etc.<p>Once you start finding that you are pulled out of the code more and more, it&#x27;s just a sign that &quot;working&quot; and &quot;producing&quot; are getting further from each other for you.

Not like this, I am sure.<p>I&#x27;ve been pulled over twice in the UK. The first time was a fair time back when I had a cheap old Saab. I was out very late near Hampstead Heath and I overtook a car, definitely exceeding the speed limit. As I did that I spotted a police panda ( car ) parked on the side, and I thought I was in for some kind of penalty. I went back to the speed limit and he caught me up. He kindly explained that my number plate wasn&#x27;t to the most recent regulations and that I should have them replaced. I thanked him very much and was on my way. 
That&#x27;s the nice end of town.<p>The other time I was visiting a friend who lived in the opposite side of the fence, near Brixton, an area known for trouble sometimes. I saw a police car behind me but was near his estate so pulled over and turned off the engine to call him to let him know I was downstairs and waiting. A sergeant knocked on my window and I was surrounded by four police. I explained that I was calling my friend, and the sergeant said that I should finish my call and I should wait. Took a few seconds, and then I hopped out if the car. They kept their distance. Apparently they thought my behaviour was suspicious because I&#x27;d pulled in and turned off my lights and engine. I explained to the police that within the past two days the law had changed so that it had become illegal to talk on a mobile phone while the engine is on. They said that they didn&#x27;t know that, and we wished each other good night and my friend and I went to the pub.<p>Oh one more. My Peugeot 205 had an issue with the spare wheel being accessible to thieves. I walked up to my car and was shocked to see my spare wheel inside on the back seat. At first I thought a thief was playing tricks. It was a walking Bobbie who&#x27;d disturbed someone trying to make off with it apparently, and who had kindly broken into my car, put the wheel in and then locked it up for me.<p>Peel chose blue for the police so as to distinguish them from the red of the military, who were armed and not well trusted. Police were not armed for the same general reason, to be part of the community.<p>[edit punctuation]",1428789251

 development dismayed law enforcement officials, who said it
 threatens what they describe as a ­centuries-old social compact
 in which the government, with a warrant based on probable
 cause, may seize evidence relevant to criminal investigations.<p>This is an interesting perspective.  I tend to view this the
opposite way.  Until spring 2013, we tended to believe that the
state doesn&#x27;t rummage around in the private lives of individual
citizens, except for warranted investigations of a few tax
cheats, drug dealers, racketeers, and the like.  Snowden&#x27;s
disclosures were a massive trust-loss event, and both companies
and individuals will be loath to offer any concession to law
enforcement without a clear demonstration of good faith and
limited access to private data.<p>I&#x27;m also glad to see this perspective from the top cybersecurity
advisor at NIST:<p>> “The basic question is, is it possible to design a completely
 secure system” to hold a master key available to the
 U.S. government but not adversaries, said Donna Dodson, chief
 cyber­security adviser at the Commerce Department’s National
 Institute of Standards and Technologies. “There’s no way to do
 this where you don’t have unintentional vulnerabilities.”<p>Personally, I&#x27;m hoping the United States eventually realizes
Dodson is right and that preserving both individual security and
law-enforcement access is futile.  Hopefully the United States
will give up on these key escrow / split key schemes and let
meatspace force break encryption on a warranted, rare basis as
investigations require.",1428786982

We filed a motion to quash, which was unsuccessful, so I was forced to take the stand. I posted the docs here: <a href=""http://mccullagh.org/subpoena/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mccullagh.org/subpoena/</a><p>So, the thoughts:<p>* I would refuse to testify against my former employer unless I were subpoenaed. Even then, I may move to quash the subpoena (this may be different in your case, of course).<p>* Being subpoenaed could include depositions and travel and courtroom testimony and rescheduled evidentiary hearings because the judge has a murder trial that&#x27;s running long -- it could take weeks of your life. This is not an hourlong process. Also, everyone else involved in this process is going to be paid for their time; who pays for yours? Do you even <i>want</i>, ethically speaking, to be paid for your time? Remember the &quot;major law firm&quot; does not work for you and does not have your best interests at heart; their interests may be opposed to yours. To protect yourself you could hire your own attorney, who isn&#x27;t going to work for free.<p>* If your former employer has an active fanbase and strongly and convincingly denies your allegations, you could be attacked by name, and your family members dragged into this, online and via social media.<p>* There are innumerable laws and regulations, some of them rather nuts, and at least one employee at every large company may have innocently violated one of them at some point. Do the laws you believe your ex-employer violated punish behavior that <i>you</i> personally believe should be illegal (<i>malum in se</i> vs. <i>malum prohibitum</i>)? And did management know about and approve these illegal actions, or was it a rogue employee at fault? If the answer to either question is &quot;no,&quot; you may want to drop this.<p>* Now that you&#x27;ve been contacted by a law firm, you could be subpoenaed even if you do not respond and try to drop this.<p>* If you believe your former employer has institutionally engaged in actions that are illegal and unethical, you have other options beyond testifying. You could write up your experiences and post them publicly, anonymously if necessary.",1428786844

9360833,comment,9360093,9360093,0,0,gojomo,,,"How controversial are the laws broken?<p>For example, do you think they&#x27;re good laws? Or do you think these laws are widely broken, at least technically, by all comparable companies because they&#x27;re unrealistic, and any harm to non-consenting third parties is negligible?<p>Do only a few of the worst operators, or worst divisions of a larger company, break these laws? Do the laws effectively protect identifiable victims?<p>This could matter, because with good laws, lawful operators are happy to see transgressing competitors take a fall. And lawful operators need to hire people who help them stay compliant.<p>But with problematic laws, that are hard to obey and thus widely violated but with no harm to others, people who (cheerfully) become involved in their enforcement can become distrusted. (Did you earnestly try to check the lawbreaking when first observed, or just stockpile evidence for a later legal assault? The 2nd strategy can appear to be scheming or disloyal even if the law is righteous.)<p>IFF (and it&#x27;s a big IFF) anyone ever sees your testimony as part of a hiring-evaluation, whether they care will depend on whether the case looks like a shake-down/gotcha/technical-violation, or a remedy-of-great-injustice.<p>OTOH, I tend to agree with others that this is unlikely to be a big deal. Individual witnesses don&#x27;t get that much coverage. Unless you&#x27;re the plaintiff/whistleblower, you&#x27;re just one of many people called upon to tell the truth. The case could easily be resolved long before your testimony becomes public. Even if it seems at the moment like a giant controversy involving titans of the industry, it&#x27;ll soon become a footnote, not a headline, about your career, and equally as likely to help (with most major and upstanding employers) as it could hurt.",1428786182

The same sort of argument could easily be used for any tactic that ever resulted in anyone being convicted for something they most likely did - in a hypothetical alternative scenario, they might just as well have been extolling the benefits of torture by saying how after having a few of his fingernails pulled out, the scumbag trucker was more than happy to confess to his crimes.<p>Nobody is doubting that giving the prosecutors more powers to produce incriminating material will produce more convictions. Emotionally charged anecdotes like this just serve to distract from the discussion about proportionality and possible abuses that we should be having, while providing no relevant information.",1428786081

It does not exist in   nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.<p>It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil. If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men, the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui.</i><p>The above are all three quotes from <i>Helen Keller.</i><p>I will suggest that you do whatever it is you believe to be ethical. Well paid careers are often careers in which character and trustworthiness are important. It is part of why you get paid: They can trust you with the keys to the thing or the personal data on people or whatever. If a law firm knew to contact you, then it isn&#x27;t a secret that you have insider info. If you do the unethical thing, people learn of that.<p>If you want some &quot;plausible deniability,&quot; sure, tell them to subpoena you. But reputation matters immensely and when something like this comes into your life, the question is not whether or not you can avoid the consequences. There will almost certainly be consequences. There will almost certainly be a price to pay and, whatever you choose, the price may well be painful. When all is said and done, do what you believe to be the ethical thing. It will do the most to protect your employability. So avoiding the consequences should not enter your mind. The choice here is <i>which set of consequences do you prefer?</i><p>There is also no price you can place on a clear conscience. I like being able to sleep well at night. I have a medical condition, so a good night&#x27;s sleep is something I have fought hard for. I would hate to lose my good sleep habits over a guilty conscience. Having lived my entire life suffering from a serious medical condition, I believe firmly that <i>bars do not a prison make.</i> The prison of our own body or our own mind is often far worse than anything anyone else can do to us.<p>Best of luck with both your decision and the path forward.",1428786068

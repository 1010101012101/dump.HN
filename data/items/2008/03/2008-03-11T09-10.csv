Let's say we do not agree about anything. After thoroughly exploring our belief space and noticing this, we will have to agree that we do not agree on anything. So there you have it, a common belief.<p>BTW, I am looking for prior art on this one. Any philosophy students around? I think it is related to Russel's Paradox. Any help in elucidating this would be apreciated. Hey, we could co-author the publication :-P",1205229200

134098,comment,133978,133978,0,0,tim2,,,"> My suggestion is that Karma could be incremented based on some fraction of the number of upmods that occur on an article you upmodded after you did so.<p>Yes, I'm working with a similar scheme on my site. This rewards people for predicting what will be popular and provides a big incentive to check out the new content.<p>The basic system is something like a stock market (that's how I initially visualized it). It costs zero to vote on something but if it goes negative then you lose points, positive then you gain. Like ""icky"" says here, this approach would have some vulnerabilities here since content is rarely voted down (which is good.)<p>Ultimately, the closer the karma number correlates with how useful the user is being, the more benefit the community will receive through some properties of game mechanics. Right now, that correlation isn't very high.",1205228110

134095,comment,134070,134070,0,0,myoung8,,,"Assuming you want to be a VC:<p>1. set up a limited partnership (LP)--you'll need a good lawyer for this
2. word of mouth is how the business operates for the most part, but you could gain some exposure by hosting/judging at business plan competitions (e.g. Stanford's BASES Social E-Challenge, which is coming up--they're still looking for judges I think and I know the guy in charge, so let me know if you want to be put in touch)
3. Money needed = (# of boards you want to/can reasonably sit on * average amount of money you want to invest in a startup) + miscellaneous -- most VCs make 1-3 new investments per year in the $1-$10M range, so you would probably need about $30-$50M to have a reputable fund
4. major gotchas: VC investing isn't all about the money, it's really a people business. they spend 70% of their time talking to people, most people that can help their portfolio companies<p>like jgrahamc said, if you don't have a lot of time, you probably shouldn't be a VC, look into angel investing. if you're really serious about it, try to get in touch with Ron Conway or Mike Maples, they're two of the best known angels in the Valley.",1205227620

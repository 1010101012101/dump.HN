135860,comment,135723,135723,0,0,Frocer,,,"I disagree.  In my opinion, if used right, social networking is the ultimate organization and communication tool.  Facebook has gradually evolved to become an excellent organized address book.  It keeps track of all my friends' contact information, birthdays, etc.  Sure, you can do all that in an Excel spreadsheet, but could you always have the information up to date like Facebook is?<p>In the same argument, you can also argue instant messengers and Emails are total waste of time.  Since god knows how much time employees waste chatting over instant messengers, sending unrelated Emails?  Hence, you also need to look at the benefits of how much time Emails and IM saves you.  There are always benefits/disadvantage of every tool, it all depends on how you use it.",1205401879

135856,comment,135829,135829,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"What we've been doing is the following:<p>Source code management system (we use SVN) with two branches: development and production.   Anything goes on development and we use the ElectricCommander system to do automatic build and test off of the development branch.<p>Code that's being released to production is manually merged to the production branch and ElectricCommander runs build and test.<p>To deploy we have a staging server that takes the output from the build system and we can use it for final testing if we want to do something manual (mostly we don't).   Then the build system is instructed to deploy the code (which in our case is rsync over ssh to our servers).<p>The servers will pick up the new code by cycling virtual machines (basically all our servers are virtual and when the VM starts it picks up the latest code).",1205400806

135850,comment,135829,135829,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I too am interested in this. I'm a relative newbie to this all.<p>At the moment, we have a simple script that pulls down the latest (or any) revision and deploys it on the production server. Our app is mostly client side, so there's not a lot of complex backend logic, which makes things easier.<p>I <i>highly</i> recommend having separate dev and production servers for anything but the simplest app. SliceHost slices or other VPS works well for this. Just make sure you get one with enough memory. We were regularly wedging our 256MB dev slice, which was a pain in the ass.",1205400051

The access to learning opportunity was just tremendous, with every subject at my fingertip.  I mean, you just don't get the chance to learn from experts in fields of engineering, business, philosophy, sociology, sciences, music, and many other subjects outside of college.  But, I suppose now we have Wikipedia!<p>However though, I have always thought middle school through high school was a total waste of time.  For what you learn... the US education system could easily condense those 7 years to 2.",1205399917

7806823,comment,7806288,7806288,42,0,ACow_Adonis,,,"This was actually sent round a couple of weeks ago where I work by one of our executives (I work at a place that has Statistics in its name).<p>I didn&#x27;t mention it then, because I didn&#x27;t want to be a debbie downer and hurt everyone&#x27;s &quot;rah rah statistics yay!&quot; feeling.  Or send something round that contradicts an executive :P  But the paper seemed dodgy as hell to me.<p>This wasn&#x27;t solved with Statistics.  Nor was it solved by Bayesian statistics.  It was solved when people did lots of searching, failed to find anything for a while despite searching where the plane was, and then they eventually found the plane near its last known location despite having already searched there.<p>If anything, the paper was just an application of the texas sharpshooter fallacy.  I believe the authors made several models, and then included the one in the paper that showed the result they wanted.<p>See paper: <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.370.2913&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.370...</a><p>Indeed, see the graphical representation of the probability distribution in the paper, you&#x27;ll notice that the plane was found in a section of the probability distribution that had already been searched earlier: an area that should now have a lower probability than the opposite half of the probability distribution if we&#x27;re using semi-reasonable bayesian techniques.  Indeed, this is what we see in figure seven.<p>In figure 8, we see their new probability distribution under the assumption that the beacons did not work at all, where they try to say their method pinpointed where the plane was.  But since this was not known at the time, and figure 7 is the far more reasonable bayesian model given previous searches in the area (because figure 8 assumes a 100% probability of both beacons failing, something practically no bayesian would do), i posit that they either made that model after the fact, or they indeed had several models fitting several different scenarios, and after the plane was found, they chose the one that best fit the data post-facto.  Odds are, if the plane was found, it would fit one of their scenarios, and they would then write a paper saying how their model was such a success.  Figure 7 is the far more reasonable bayesian distribution, and it actually tells you to now search in the wrong area.<p>If they followed bayesian methods, there is in fact a bottom half of their distribution that should of been searched next (where the plane wasn&#x27;t), and they in fact found the plane in an area that had already been passively searched: an area that should have downplayed by bayesian probabilities for future searches because of the unlikely-ness of this area being searched and yet still finding nothing.<p>I actually like Bayes, A LOT, but this is not a good example, except perhaps of the precept: if you want to find a lost plane, its probably a good idea to start looking near where it was last located.",1401224323

NaCl is a complete operating system API in the browser, and basically impossible for anyone but Google to implement (because it is proprietary, but also because of its sheer complexity).<p>Then, native browser plugins were &quot;omnipotent&quot; and could do anything the user could do. Of course, this has security implications, which was why people wanted to get rid of them. But these are not unsolvable. Remember how insecure browsers were a few years ago, and look at how much work has went into securing them. Chrome uses sophisticated sandboxing of its individual parts. One could use this, or other modern techniques to contain plugins (containers, virtualization. Hell, you could just run plugins under a different user with restricted rights and it would help a lot).<p>Security worries are not the reason. The real &quot;problem&quot; is that native code allows to much.<p>- You can access the hardware and play back (potentially pirated) videos in any format at high speed.<p>- You can access sockets and do any kind of communication (AFAIK this is not possible in pepper plugins, and in NaCl only with restrictions, and you are registered with your name with Google). You could write a file sharing client, a darknet, etc.. You could have a plugin that scrapes information from other sites. And you could do it all without having a domain, and without being legally accountable.<p>- You can access the hardware, and peripherals - I guess there is a business opportunity for Google if manufacturers have to pay so their devices (printers, 3D headsets, ...) work with Chrome.

I spent a couple years doing public speaking about my experiences and am always happy to find ways to leverage them in ways that might directly or indirectly help others.<p>I suppose I could throw some random thoughts out there.<p>I think in general what people did that helped the most, was accept me for who I was without coddling me. Showing me respect, not pity. I hated pity. I thought my balance in my life was fine, and if it got in the way of something I really wanted to do, I would make adjustments. I really valued people that would invite me places they would invite anyone else and let me pull my own weight and make my own mind up each time even if I have said no 20 times prior. Just being invited to social outings even when I had no intention of going, boosted my perceived social value each time.<p>As people gained my trust, they were able to challenge me on the things I said I wanted out of life, and what present aspects of my lifestyle were incompatible.<p>I think for me my own pride became my fuel, and a series of &quot;challenge accepted&quot; moments. I could never turn down a well formed challenge or someone telling me I _can&#x27;t_ do something.<p>Smaller challenges like &quot;holding a retail job&quot; grew to bigger ones like &quot;CTO&quot;, &quot;Senior Software Engineer&quot;, &quot;Technical Director&quot; and eventually things I once said would never be possible like &quot;having a healthy relationship&quot; and &quot;Getting married&quot;. Once the &quot;small&quot; challenges met success I have ever since been on a journey to find out where my ceiling is. Doing things I thought I could never do has become an addiction now, and not a whole lot scares me anymore.<p>I also was really stubborn/prideful and not good at accepting help, ever. Still am to a  point, but getting better. Sometimes people had to help me in creative ways where I could not stop them easily. There are a number of times where I think people proved they cared about me more than I presently cared about myself, and that gave me the desire to up my own game.<p>Anyway. I am sure I could go on forever but this is already probably going to be a TLDR anyway.<p>I am happy to answer any questions here or via email/hangout etc. :)",1401223463

The integrations were nice and the search was amazing, but those things were less important to us than the frictionless communication tools, which HipChat has nailed.

A website will contain a single HTML page (typically heavily cached and served via a CDN). The JS on that page will then fetch content (as JSON) from the server and change the path as necessary using pushState.</i><p>I find the cheerleading for single page websites disconcerting and the proposed benefits unconvincing. Why should this be the default way to build websites? A few desultory upsides are presented without a full consideration of the multiple downsides to client-side development.<p>The biggest advantage of thick-client architecture is sending less data to the client and, if you like using javascript, writing everything in js, but there are multiple downsides compared to more traditional thin-client websites - load times which depend more on client capabilities (hugely variable and out of your control) than servers, dependence on js on the client, loading pages while your content is placed in the dom by js, forcing everyone to write in js instead of switching language on the server whenever they like, ignoring the simple document model of html served at predictable URIs, which has served the web so well and means you can use dynamic or static documents, full documents can be cached for very quick serving and by intermediaries, etc, etc. Of course some of these can be overcome, but there are serious obstacles, and the advantages are meagre to non-existent unless you enjoy javascript and feel its the only language you&#x27;ll ever need.<p>For someone who doesn&#x27;t like working in js, and/or doesn&#x27;t have a huge amount of logic already in js (many websites work just fine with some limited ajax), trying to force every website into the procrustean bed of client-side development is not an appealing prospect. I can see why it appeals to those who have already invested in js frameworks, but predictions of its future dominance on the web, like predictions that eworld, activex or mobile would replace the web, are overblown.<p>I suspect the birth and death of Javascript will be a footnote in the history of the web, rather than taking it over as this article suggests. If anything we should be looking to replace our dependence on js, not making it mandatory.",1401221641
7806583,comment,7806112,7806341,7,0,waps,,,"By assuming they evolve in the same way they&#x27;ve been evolving since WWII. While it may not look like it in San Francisco, but there are huge groups in the country, white and non-white that are having quite a few kids. Not enough to make population rise, but enough to keep it stable. It seems a vast number of people prefers a small city or medium city lifestyle with 3 kids. The weird thing is that this will make the experience of so many San Franciscans today a feature of the first half of the 21st century too. A hell of a lot of new immigrants will come from a pretty strict religious background and feel like releasing some steam in their early twenties. The influx of people like that should continue for another 20 years at least.<p>So the assumption is that the population of the US will continue to climb slowly due to natural growth, accelerated a little bit, but not much, by immigration.<p>Now if you look at the EU or China, they have a very different story. The EU has been stuck in a massive population drop rate (roughly approaching next generations being 50-70% of the previous generation for all of Western Europe, coupled with massive immigration numbers that make the numbers barely stable). That means that in a lot of countries in Western Europe, approaching 50% of the <20 population is of foreign origin, first or second generation, mostly from Northern Africa and the middle east. These numbers look scary, yet in the major cities, Paris, London, ... they look a lot scarier still. If the &quot;unemployed youths that don&#x27;t fit into society leads to revolution&quot; crowd is correct, Europe has maybe 5-10 years left before that happens. There may be a further delay because of the simple fact that European mistreatment of the poor is still a lot better treatment than islamic nations&#x27; treatment of the middle class and the rich. So the immediate immigrants are actually quite content to be abused. Their children, however, are not.<p>China is in a pickle. They need, absolutely need, a lot of population growth to avoid disaster, but in absolute numbers everything they built is filled to the brim. They are trying to use the &quot;one child policy&quot; to spread out the population by relaxing it for ethnic Chinese in the outer regions, like Xinjang or Tibet. So if you are Chinese and want kids, if you move there and get a job there (Chinese control most businesses and employers are at least somewhat racist, so it&#x27;s not impossibly hard), the government will let you do that, up to 5 kids in some places. The purpose is, of course, slow ethnic cleansing, but given that it&#x27;s China, the UN will never even mention it.",1401221615

How can we resolve this gap or deficiency in critical skills in the workplace?",1401221127

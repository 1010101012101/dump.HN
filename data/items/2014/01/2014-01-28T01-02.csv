It&#x27;s an extra cost and their service is provided even if I don&#x27;t pay because somebody else will pay for it. Why should these protection firms cooperate. How do we know the regulators aren&#x27;t influenced by whichever of the protection firms they buy from? Remember it&#x27;s only illegal for these regulators to lie if your own protection company supports the particular laws that require this other company to be accurate.<p>If people are apathetic about the property rights of their neighbour what right does the government have to step in and stop them taking that property?<p>In fact how would that even work in this pay for protection system? The neighbour will buy into a protection firm that will take the property back and a fee? If they can&#x27;t pay the fee they will be placed in a work camp to deter the same action from others? Unfortunately the cost for board is higher than what your paid in the work camp. Is this perfectly acceptable under your system? If not how is it prevented? Does that man buy protection from a second company that will go in and storm the workcamp? If you&#x27;re too poor to buy protection from one of the companies how is it illegal for them to just be collected and put in work camps?  I just can&#x27;t see your system of pay for protection being less abusive than one with a government.",1390874279
7134819,comment,7134766,7134766,2,0,greatdox,,,"Quite frankly the Freemium games get on my nerves for the following reasons:<p>#1 Most people just want to play a game, but they have to keep making these &#x27;microtransactions&#x27; for some sort of virtual currency that speeds up development or certain items in the game can only be bought with virtual currency that is really hard to earn for free. If it was easier to earn the virtual currency it would not be so bad, but most games make it next to impossible to earn virtual currency to buy these items.<p>#2 The really wealthy will just buy their way to the top players in any Freemium game with little to no talent or game knowledge. The really poor will be battered and taken advantage of by the really wealthy in the freemium game just like in real life.<p>#3 Most of these games you level up by gaining experience points. In most freemium games I played I leveled up and then hit a wall, and the freemium developers didn&#x27;t add in new levels but instead focused on adding new items to keep selling new items with virtual currency and most of the new items were just dupes of existing items with the color changed or reversed.<p>#4 Most freemium games copy each other so much that if you play one freemium game, you&#x27;ve basically played most of them already.<p>#5 I&#x27;d rather pay $30 to $60 for a video game and then not have to deal with freemium stuff that requires me to pay thousands of dollars just to compete with the wealthy players. I get tired of Freemium for example and find myself playing Civilization V instead that has free mods and other stuff for it. Sure I had to buy DLC, but over all it is cheaper when Steam has them on sale and I don&#x27;t have to keep making microtransactions to keep up with the wealthy players.",1390874274

It&#x27;s done somewhat routinely in some institutions (although it is very, very expensive).<p>You first need to make humanize mice (i.e. mice with human immune systems). Luckily we can make those by taking NOD/SCID mice (an [expensive] immunodeficient mouse line) and then colonize them with human hematopoietic stem cells from a human donor to reconstitue the immune system. Then you have to do a lot of experiments to make sure your humanized mice can mount immune responses. Then, you can test your peptide and see if your humanized mice will make CD8 T cells to your peptide... Finally, you can infect your mice with HIV (now that you have a humanized immune system) and see how your vaccinated vs. unvaccinated mice fare.<p>I have no idea what the downsides of this approach are because I don&#x27;t work on HIV or with humanized mice--but mice ain&#x27;t people. So after all that work you&#x27;d have shed limited light on what would happen in real people.<p>I would argue that a better approach is to see whether HIV patients have actually made CD8 T cells against these antigens.

7134681,comment,7134353,7134353,12,0,rgejman,,,"Some thoughts on this white paper, with the caveat that I&#x27;m not sure how much of what is discussed they have done and how much of it is what they are planning to do. The white paper is light on details and I re-iterate my appeal for them to release their data (at least in summary form). My apologies for some of the technical language--I want to write this first and then I can clarify the hard stuff (or you can google it)<p>This vaccine relies on inducing immunity to an HIV peptide* (i.e. a ~9 amino acid cleavage product of an HIV protein) that is predicted to bind to HLA molecules. At first blush, this sounds like a great idea--let&#x27;s immunize people to the very thing that the immune system is supposed to recognize as bad! Unfortunately, this has been tried lots of times and usually doesn&#x27;t work very well, if at all. It&#x27;s been tried in cancer, it&#x27;s been tried in HIV, it&#x27;s been tried in practically any system you can imagine. I&#x27;m not saying that peptide vaccines don&#x27;t ever work (hell, my lab has worked on one)--I&#x27;m just saying that they have had lots of promise and limited successes. In fact, animals and patients have been immunized to many cleavage products of many cancer associated antigens to little, if any, effect—or effects in animals but not in humans. We can hem and haw all day about what the specific studies show, but suffice it to say that peptide vaccines are an old idea. Perhaps Immunity will get lucky here, but I&#x27;d be surprised if there isn&#x27;t a lab somewhere that has tried immunizing animals to every single breakdown product of HIV proteins already.<p>Immunity&#x27;s white paper says that their putatively immunogenic human peptide cannot be tested in animal models because it will only bind to human HLA. So they are planning to use a mouse-analog of the human peptide to do their animal testing (or have already done this?). That is, they are planning to use (or maybe have already used?) a completely different peptide (probably 1-3 amino acids different from the human version) in animal studies than what they would use in patients. This may be a significant difference... or it might not be. There&#x27;s no way to tell a priori. A more classical and IMO better approach would be to identify T cell receptor clones from patients with HIV (or without HIV) that bind to these peptides (using tetramer staining, phage display or some other high-throughput technology), demonstrate that humans are capable of creating T cells that recognize their putatively immunogenic peptide followed by T cell killing assays on cells presenting their peptide of interest. There are other approaches, but that is a commonly used one in the field.<p>* in some places the white paper says &quot;peptides&quot; and in other it says &quot;peptide&quot; so it&#x27;s not clear if we are talking about 1 peptide or multiple. I think they are mostly talking about multiple peptides, because they want to immunize people no matter their HLA type. Different HLA types bind to different peptides. So if you have HLA A02 you will bind different peptides than if you have HLA A24... and so on for all the different HLA types.",1390872266

However, is it really an algorithm? If there is no output one could simply replace that with just empty machine that halts for sure, therefore it can be simulated in C preprocessor.<p>On the other hand, if this is not requirement then we know that every algorithm we have to simulate to prove turing completeness halts eventually, there is no ability to re-enter old states but if algorithm halts we could just add enough more states (finitely many) that allows it to finish.",1390870840

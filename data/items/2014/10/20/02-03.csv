I found the curved alignment of the keys annoying. The thumb keys also felt off, but I don&#x27;t recall how.<p>3. The remapping support for Kinesis is far inferior to Ergodox&#x27;s. When I talked to tech support, they recommended using macros rather than remapping keys. This is because switching from Qwerty to Dvorak wipes any key remappings. Certainly I don&#x27;t want to risk losing my keyboard layout, so macros are the way to go. But there&#x27;s a maximum of 48 macros that can be stored, so you could only remap 48 keys. That&#x27;s probably an acceptable limit if you don&#x27;t need a bunch of extra macros. However, having a lot of macros means you might lose keystrokes^1. Compare this to the Ergodox, which lets you place any key anywhere with no downside other than your memory and ergonomics. You can also have multiple key layouts, and switch between them easily.<p>4. I was trying to switch to the Kinesis while at work, making it more frustrating when I was slow. I switched to the Ergodox at home, so I had more time. I also got the Ergodox after I tried the Kinesis, so some of the muscle memory was already entrenched when I got the Ergodox.<p>5. I borrowed the Kinesis, but bought and assembled the Ergodox. This means I was more invested in liking the Ergodox, whether or not it was actually better.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/support/technical-support/faqs-advantage-keyboard/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/support/technical-support/faqs-a...</a> , the section &quot;How do I switch between the macro memory configurations of 24, 36, or 48 macros?&quot; states &quot;Fast typists will often lose keystrokes from certain common words with the 48 macro setting, and very fast typists may even lose keystrokes using the 36 macro setting.&quot;",1413771774

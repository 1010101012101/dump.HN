Borrowing something would imply that you were going to return it at some point, which doesn't really fit with how that scenario works.  I think a more appropriate way of thinking about artistic influence is through the concepts of copying and transformation.<p>Copying is the act of stealing without transformation.  In other words, the work is purely derivative.  Transformation, on the other hand, is the act of combining your influence(s) and using them as a basis for a new idea.  I don't think it makes much of a difference whether this is an intentional or unconscious act.  Both copying and transformation have their place in art.<p>Most artists start out through imitation (copying) and move on to transformation.  For example, Keith Richards started out by obsessively copying the styles of American Blues artists, it wasn't until years later that he had absorbed those early influences enough to go on to transform them into his own distinctive style of playing.  Same with someone like Picasso. His early work is rooted in traditional realism.  Later on he would go on to be heavily influenced by symbolism and African folk art- which ultimately led to Cubism.",1332104365

3720948,comment,3720332,3720332,2,0,aestetix,,,"pg, thanks for bringing this up! It's actually a really dense topic, and there are a bunch of ways to look at it. Having done an increasing amount of public speaking over the last few years, I can say from experience that there are a lot of dynamics at play.<p>I think you are absolutely correct, prewritten speeches, even if memorized, rarely translate well into a live speech. They usually come off as either forced, too structured, and feel like a movie that's been hastily adapted from a book.<p>There's a reason for the saying ""it's 10 percent what you say and 90 percent how you say it."" Written versus spoken words convey different things. When you're giving a talk, or listening to one, there's a sort of energy exchange that happens. A really good charismatic speaker can make every person in the room feel like they are being directly spoken to, regardless of what the topic is (Bill Clinton is famous for this). Someone who has just been in the presence of a good speaker might not remember every word in the talk, but they have a sense of personal empowerment and motivation to go do or be something.<p>The written word, on the other hand, <i>can</i> trigger those emotions, though it engages on a different level. It's an individual, rather than a group relationship. If you're in a crowd watching a good speaker, you're sharing that experience with everyone in the crowd. If you're reading a book or essay, you're sharing that moment specifically with the author, and perhaps with the topics or characters in the essay.<p>A lot of good speakers and writers alike will formulate a narrative that people can relate to. One of my favorite examples of this in writing is Charles Petzold's book ""Code"", where he demonstrates how to create a basic computer, from the ground up. The book in itself is a sort of story, where the main caricature is the advances in logic and thought over the years. He manages to take a topic that is often dry and boring (truth tables? binary arithmetic?) and creates a form people can relate to.<p>There's also a lot to be said for confidence. If a speaker is confidence, people in the room will entrust them with a sense of authority. If a writer is confident, I'm more likely to continue reading on. To describe confidence in a writer... if you consider a speaker's ability to sidestep ""um"" and ""ya know"", and their control either to not ramble offtopic or to quickly bring their ramble full circle back to the topic at hand, then also look at a writer's ability, rather than stumbling around with words, to grasp them and use them with a magician's mastery. That is, they've gotten past memorizing the alphabetic building blocks, and began to create more elaborate form and structures.<p>Ok, now <i>I</i> want to write an essay on this... :)",1332104333

One of the things you can do is compute the frequency 'footprint' of the image, then change the render until the render foot print is as close as you can get to the original. HP did this for their ink jet printer half-toning algorithm. In a 16 x 16 pixel space you could almost exaustively search it on a modern machine.<p>Cool! Do you have a link/paper/book?",1332104152

3720858,comment,3720363,3720535,14,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I agree it was a fascinating look at the problem. However, the assumption in the article is pixels. Let me sum up.<p>Scaling artifacts occur because at smaller <i>sizes</i> the quantitization of the unit pixel overwhelms the details of the image. When I was a system programmer at the Image Processing Institute at USC (you know the source of that Lena picture :-) this was characterized as the frequency response of the display. So if you were to take a horizontal line across the pixels, and then plot their intensity vertically along a line (so <i>x</i> becomes the position in the line, and <i>y</i> is the intensity of the pixel at position <i>x</i>) then you can then do an FFT across those pixels and see the distortion in the visual signal from the source material to the displayed material.<p>Now the part that gets confounded in articles like this one is that the UX designer doesn't really want a 16 <i>pixel</i> icon, what they want is an icon that has a certain size with respect to the whole screen. Working backwards, lets say the icon ended up being 16 x 16 on a 1024 x 600 screen which had 72 pixels per inch. The icon is about 1/4"" on a side (.22"" but you get the picture). Now on a screen that that has 240 pixels per inch, that icon at 16 x 16 pixels is only .06"" or nearly impossible to see, but if you keep it at 1/4"" you get  60 x 60 pixels to work with.<p>So lets bring two things together, you do 'hinting' because the artifacts that are created by the quantitizing effect of pixelation cause you to lose information. As screen resolutions get denser the information lost goes down (less quantization, or more signal bandwidth is available) so once your signal loss from a straight mathematical shrink is acceptable in all required sizes your done.<p>Bottom line is that this won't be an issue when the minimum icon size is being rendered into a field of 128 x 128 pixels or more. Might take one more generation of screens.<p>The second thing is that while a designer can poke pixels to get an icon that looks good, so can the computer. One of the things you can do is compute the frequency 'footprint' of the image, then change the render until the render foot print is as close as you can get to the original. HP did this for their ink jet printer half-toning algorithm. In a 16 x 16 pixel space you could almost exaustively search it on a modern machine.",1332102935

Just be yourself and don't try to be perfect.<p>=> Forget that you presenting to a crowd, rather think of speaking to just one persona good friend (imagine this, would you script a conversation to a friend?? No!)<p>=> Never, really never learn a script, that's the worst thing a presenter can do (ok, you need for very formal und official occasions like political speeches a script but even then some parts shouldn't be scripted word by word). Just rehearse the first five sentences of your presentation (to get in) + the topics you want to talk about. Before the presentation practice, but don't take notes just use the few topics to have some rough storyline. That's enough, the rest will come to your mind by itself. Sometimes you have to think and you make short pauses but this is normal and makes the speech authentic. Again THAT'S your problem: you want to be perfect, to deliver a perfect speech with no mistakes and to go into a presentation with this expectations just doesn't work.<p>=> Ideas and the presentation's contents are the most important part of a presentation (not accurately chosen words). Great ideas are not so important for the audience as they are for your enthusiasm and charisma while being on stage. If you haven't got any outstanding idea (good is not enough), don't present. If you have just one very good idea then do not present 10 other crap ideas. Look, the content has to be so great that when it came the first time to your mind you had the urge to call a friend and to tell it to him. If you are really enthusiastic about your content you don't need a damn script. Or with other words: your goal is not to deliver a perfect speech for the sake of a perfect speech, your goal is to transport a brilliant idea. I know that there many good speeches where the content is not brilliant but that doesn't matter, important is that YOU/the speaker think the ideas are brilliant.<p>=> Ultimately, you need tons of self-confidence, that means that you are really proud of yourself or better your really love yourself and what you are going to say (basically that's the most important thing; the more self-confidence you have, the smaller is your need to deliver a perfect presentation)<p>=> A final hack: sit while presenting if the circumstances allow (much easier and good for beginners)<p>I saw you on some panels, you were very good, charismatic and strong (because your talks weren't scripted). Don't say you are a bad speaker, you are pretty good, you just had a bad day or you havent found the key yet. And look: maybe your presentation wasn't the best but did we stopped liking you?

Error: You must set a username before you can chat<p>When I first login, it says I'm in a chatroom of 1 for quite a bit, then connects me invisibly, without letting me set my username.<p>Would this fail with https?<p>On a side note, somebody that creates an aggregator for these sort of add ons, (including chats, but also the various ""comment on a website"" things I remember from a few years ago) might do alright.<p>When I finally do get in the chat, after trying to set a username, I get a random one. I'm user37695.  And there is no way to change that.<p>Edit: okay there is a way, clicking on your username.  But it's invisible.<p>Thoughts:
Needs to let me know I'm connecting, and if possible, indicate state.  IRC tells me when I'm connecting, when it's checking identd etc.  Even a little progress bar would be fine.<p>Username selection seems to fail for me.  I'd suggest a prompt, after connecting, for the username.<p>edit: indicating that clicking the username allows you to change it, or a menu button, would be helpful.<p>There is no way to close the window without losing the page.",1332100800

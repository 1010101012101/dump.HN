Yes, there's a reason, and I was reminded of an anecdote regarding blackberries being served in the lobby to the press.<p>iChat is a presence and messaging framework that's completely ad hoc. The server frameworks don't do anything but presence and messaging.<p>Not so with Facetime. Apple just aimed a loaded gun at RIM, Avaya, and Ericsson today, and Facetime is the proof of concept. Verizon on the iPad was cocking the hammer. Apple has just shown the world that it has full enterprise communication stack integration from LDAP to device and more importantly the network in-between... and that network in between has a lot of control. Apple needs these guys a lot.<p>Submitting the protocol stack to the IETF is a win with consumers, but I'm sure that RIM, Ericsson, etc., are seeing this as spit on the face and more to the point it's probably why the guy at RIM completely lost his cool last week.<p>Apple is going at the enterprise in a remarkable manner, and probably the only way they could have.",1287629927

The only group that did seem to use the feature is an old users group that has a very outdated iCal calendar and a group hackfest project from 2006 in a tarfile.<p>Maybe I'm missing the point here, but why should Google be forced to maintain and update a feature of one of their products that from my observation, no one uses?

More than that, they've tried to spur on some pretty radical freedoms - like my Nexus One which they convinced HTC to provide fully unlockable: a simple command and a warning screen away. This was unthinkable not so very long ago, certainly in smart phones. Frustratingly enough, the market wasn't interested, but they tried. And may well try to keep pushing that bar forward. But you'll give them no quarter - they are damned for not reshaping things to your preferred standards in one fell swoop, they are responsible for both the hardware and the regressive policies of every idiot vendor whose usage of the platform they bless.<p>It's a bit overdone to say that ""the openness is primarily for the benefit of handset makers and carriers who can use those tarballs"". I'm interested in where you've acquired this insight into Google's treacherous true motivations, and I'm surprised to learn that it's so hard to take those ""tarballs"" and get them running on arbitrary hardware. That damned linux kernel, so notoriously hard to get running on variant hardware.<p>When you get down to it, your real problem seems to be that Android strikes a fairly neutral deal, allowing the carriers and manufacturers to keep their freedoms too. They're free to try to turn back the clock, release terribly gimped phones, and just generally be the dicks that we have always known them to be. We're free to reject it, and should.",1287629839

This is not news. However, what people that swear by the ""limit choices"" mantra fail to recognize is that this stress is endured for the benefit of providing better to one's self, family, and others. For example, as a U.S. consumer, I hate the cereal aisle. Way too many choices. But, if I can bring home something that is desired by my family or something new that might make my family more healthy or happy, I'm happy to bear the burden of a more stressful choice.<p>But, having more choices is not always better. Additional complexity is stressful as stated. So, you need a balance between choice and the freedom to choice what is ""best"".<p><i>Federal law permits people to take their phone numbers with them if they switch cell phone service.

1814076,comment,1812549,1813973,0,0,lsc,,,"eh, the thing is, most of the time, if you are selling, say, kingston ram, when you buy advertising, you are trying to exploit a disparity in information access.    I buy lots of ram, right?  I've used three grand worth of ram so far this month and have 1/3rd of that on order. I want to pay the lowest price I can for acceptable quality (usually defined as being made by one of several brands.) ram.  I spend a fair amount of effort seeking out the lowest price on ram.<p>If you are trying to sell ram to me as a retailer, paying money to reach me is probably going to kill any margin you would get from my purchase... to sell me ram you need to be the lowest price of a particular set of brands that I can find.   Getting yourself on google shopping would probably be cheaper, and it would be just as effective (maybe more effective... I assume that when I click thorough a paid add, I expect to pay a premium on the other end to pay for the cost of that click through.)<p>Now, if you are trying to sell ram to someone who, say, doesn't know that google shopping exists, then maybe you can charge more than google shopping and then pay money for an ad to reach that customer.<p>So, in general, less-savvy consumers who don't understand how to effectively price shop are far more valuable to advertisers.   And reddit users usually don't fall into that 'less savvy' bucket.<p>Now,  this is true for the majority of retailers... people who are trying to sell commodity products.<p>If, on the other hand, you are trying to build a brand, and you can get your add to somehow imply that you are supporting reddit, or you are part of the reddit community (and there is room for that... by buying advertising space, you are supporting reddit, even though you have selfish motives in doing so.)  you can effectively leverage that to build your brand amongst those more savvy users (and more savvy users tend to have control of more resources, over time, simply because savvy  users generally make better decisions.)<p>So yeah... if you are trying to sell ram to me as a retailer, ads are probably not going to help you.  But if you are a ram manufacturer or a ram ""brand"" (like kingston) and you are trying to put yourself on my list of 'acceptable quality' ram vendors, then advertising on reddit could possibly help you.",1287629123

For example, just working with mapping data, I need to be able to think pretty extensively about functions for changing coordinate systems, figuring out which tiles I need for a specific zoom level, etc.  Of course the actual math itself is basic trig, the abstract concepts are much more difficult, and I'd argue those are math related.<p>Extending the mapping analogy, I built a 3D terrain system with a simple mesh overlay, and drew a 3D route inside of the system.  I had to map the route onto the terrain, and to do that I needed to understand a good amount of vector manipulation (cross products amongst others).  Maybe this is 8th grade math in Russia, but it certainly isn't taught until College here in the US.<p>So, yes writing a program itself doesn't require math, but many of the cool domains require math.",1287628327

Such people are more likely to pay attention to what is being advertised as well as they're conscious the advertisements are there by choice.<p>Marketing done carefully on such sites can lead to a much more effective turnover if it identifies with the group it's targeting. A few good examples are the beef jerky company and the Reddit soap rescue done about 12 months ago. Forgotten both their names but can do a search if need be :-)",1287626813

Are they supposed to get all riled up because someone owns a brothel, or is a waiter in a strip club?<p>Hell, I remember a pedophile who recognised that his tendencies were harmful to children and had vowed never to act on them. Given that he can't change his condition, I think that was a brave and mature thing to do. While I obviously don't support pedophilia, I think that realizing that your desires can cause harm and restraining yourself from them is not something to condemn.<p>Apart from that, I find that it's really valuable to try and see things from someone's viewpoint, no matter who that person is. There have been many people doing IAmAs, and I find that critically deciding whether this person is someone to support or to condemn was eye-opening.

I like many others still value real physical publications enough to pay for them. Even if I mostly read news and info online, I don't pay for anything I read online.

They are somewhat kitschy but they at least don’t suggest that video chat might be useful for, say, restaurant reservations.<p>Telephones are awesome. They get most any job you throw at them done with ease. Why would anyone go through all the trouble of buying expensive stuff and setting all that technology up and then paying much more just to get a grainy stuttering picture?<p>That was the situation until only a few years ago. If you want people to actually use video chat in those rare instances when it’s appropriate you have to make it really frictionless.

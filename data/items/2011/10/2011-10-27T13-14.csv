Natami is the most capable of the bunch (aiming to be a faster, better Amiga), while Chameleon is probably the smallest (the size of an old style Commodore 64 cartridge, and can plug into a real Commodore 64, since it started as a C64 expansion on steroids, but it can run standalone too), with FPGA Arcade a nice middle group (fits in Mini-ITX form factor boxes, but isn't deep enough to fill nearly all of the box).<p>FPGA Arcade: <a href=""http://www.fpgaarcade.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fpgaarcade.com/</a>

I would suggest the B1/B2 visa used for leisure-tourism and/or business. Ideally, if you can get a multiple entry visa valid for a few years, it would enable your visit for the interview, as well as a stay for three-odd months during the Winter session as well.

3163020,comment,3151751,3157758,1,0,jules,,,"Message passing OO like in Ruby and Smalltalk means that an object receives messages that it can interpret in any way it wants. For example you can create an object that prints the messages to the console:<p><pre><code>    class Foo
      def method_missing(meth, *args)
        puts ""#{meth}(#{args.join(',')})""
      end
    end

    f = Foo.new
    f.foo() # prints foo()
    f.bar(1,2) # prints bar(1,2)
    f[2] = ""hello"" # prints []=(""hello"")
</code></pre>
You can't do this with CLOS because methods are lexically scoped.<p>Why is this interesting? For example because with this you can implement transparent remote objects. When you make a call on the object, it makes a network request, on the other computer the call is made and the result is sent back over the network, and finally the original method call returns. So the code would end up looking something like this:<p><pre><code>    # server on ip 1.2.3.4
    shared_object = Array.new
    shared_object[3] = ""good morning""
    serve_object(""foo"", shared_object)

    # client
    remote_object = RemoteObject.new(""1.2.3.4"", ""foo"")
    remote_object.length        # makes a network call to 1.2.3.4 and computes the length
    remote_object[3]            # returns ""good morning""
    remote_object[3] = ""hello""  # sets the index 3 to the string ""hello""
    # code in the server can now access shared_object[3] and it will get ""hello""
</code></pre>
Ruby actually has such a library. It's called Drb.<p>All in all, I think that generic functions are better than message passing, but generic functions are definitely not strictly more powerful.",1319723727

I figured it would get timely updates and be a stable phone.  It's far from stable.<p>I think a good anecdote for my frustrations is navigation.  When I first bought the phone, I wasn't able to turn the screen off during navigation.  I would turn it off, and it would turn itself back on draining my battery. An update came along and fixed it.  For a little while it worked as I expected.  Another update came along and now I can turn my screen off when navigating but 50% of the time when I do I have to unlock my screen.<p>Over time Android and it's core feature set have been consistently inconsistent.

Free is the operative word there. Free is a funny thing. It creates artificial demand. I'll give an example.<p>I used to do independent consulting, and in the course of consulting, recommended Google Apps for email hosting, even if the client wasn't going to use Google Docs or any of the other Google Apps services. It was the best free option for email hosting around. But the fact that it was free created some problems.<p>Most of the clients I transitioned did so at a time when mail hosts put limits on the number of mailboxes you could set up. A strange concept in today's world, but that was the status quo at the time. Clients would provide mailboxes for users and for general purpose correspondence, but they were reasonable. Once they figured out that mailboxes were free and unlimited on Google Apps (once upon a time), they'd go crazy. Soon, mailbox counts ballooned to 50 or 100 mailboxes for organizations with 15 users or less.<p>By making their APIs free, Google creates artificial demand, which raises their costs.

It was rendered unusable by iOS4.0, and although it was on ""the current version"" up until the release of iOS5 I don't recall it getting any actual feature from iOS4 other than faster javascript in the browser. So things are not as binary as depicted there.<p>It also seems like you're looking at Android through an Apple lens where the only phone updates come via the OS and having the latest version is the key metric. This means that e.g. any delay in releasing an iOS update has no impact on your graph, but if the Nexus team bust their chops to get an update out early, it makes every other phone look bad in relation.<p>What would it look like if you charted when the phones last received an update to their Maps, Youtube, or Gmail client apps from Google?. For Maps they would all be green I believe, less so for Youtube which is currently 2.2+ only so 15% of current devices wouldn't be able to get the latest version.<p>Glancing through the list of new features in iOS5 it seems to be equally split between a) things Android already had (twitter, notifications, no pc required updates), and b) things that are considered Applications, not part of the OS in Android (e.g. To-do apps, email/calendar improvements, e-magazine reader app) so there doesn't seem to be as much reason for Android users to have to upgrade.<p>So generally, from this point of view, you seem to be a bit loose with equating ""support"" from Google to mean new OS version e.g. your phrase ""tracked down every update that was released for each device"" isn't strictly true if you consider a newer version of Maps or the Market an update.

2) 'Hire' a company/freelancer to build your MVP
3) Hire someone to grow with you and build your MVP
4) Do it yourself<p>My opinion is that if your product is actually worth all of this fuss then you have to put your money where your mouth is.  I would keep the job, read more about development, save some money, and figure out how you are going to hire someone on a project basis (1099/freelancer)...there will come a time, MVP or not, that you will have to make that leap.  Sure, today is not the day.  Let's say you get your MVP created, its a hit, and then what?  What about hosting it on EC2 or dedicated servers?  What about some marketing?  What about some legal reviews?  What about incorporating (kinda need that to realistically spread equity to partners and investors)?  If you did outsource the MVP how are you going to get your new dev team up to speed when you do hire...and what if it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up because the outsourced dev did not take scaling, security, or authorization into account? What about the other 10,000 things that are going to hit you?<p>You'll be fine.  I see a lot of people that have the best of intentions that are not fiscally capable of starting a business.  You at least have a job.  Some of these stories of creating the next whiz-bang site with 10 Million users on the first day and only $1.57 in startup capital are definitely the exception and not the rule.

3162892,comment,3159210,3162372,2,0,glaurent,,,"> Considering the huge progress that was made in the 90'ties on Linux and the lack of progress done after OS X came, I think it is safe to assume that OS X played a major role here.<p>Progress in software development is not linear. You quickly get the basics done, and then the devil in the details. Also, the Gnome vs. KDE feud didn't help one bit.<p>That said, OS X being exactly what Linux dreams to be (Unix with a beautiful and useable UI, scriptable apps, reusable components, and a modern development platform), I know I'm not the only one to whom it provided a haven after years of Linux-induced frustration.<p>> Desktop Linux seems to me that it was created by stitching obsolete software and quick hacks together with glue and spit. Even broken as it is, I still marvel at how functional it is for me. And even unpopular as it is, there are some normal people using it, which goes to show that it isn't totally broken or insane.<p>No disagreement here.<p>> I don't agree there - having the source is a huge advantage, even if you aren't capable of modifying it. Just as with cars, you don't necessarily have to go to the parent company and you don't have to fix it yourself. You can always choose a local shop for repairing and tunning.<p>In theory it's true, in practice it rarely is, since taking over a code base of any significant size is a very hard challenge. I've yet to encounter a situation like you describe, or even hear about one. When the software doesn't work, you replace it, source available or not.<p>> I wonder why are you saying that, when server-side Linux and related software is such a huge hit.<p>Because the audience being other tech geeks, it's a much simpler endeavor.<p>> You can also point out to some desktop software that is free software, that is sponsored and yet community driven and that is usable.<p>Sponsored free software is usually mostly developed by the company sponsoring it, the community comes a distant second. This is a scheme which works, though, as the company has the final say. I hope it will keep on growing.",1319721795

3162815,comment,3162155,3162792,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Apologies if I did a poor job explaining. Perhaps I should restate. Yes, test first. But the test is user wants, not code functionality.<p>So to your example, you sell a mock-up. If they want it, then you go back and test-first and code. If you can find out they want time tracking without coding, what are you coding for? If you are coding one thing and they really want something else, what are you coding for?<p>I'd argue that if you have customers that are directing your sprints, timeboxes, or whatever, then <i>you're already past the point I am talking about.</i> They have money, they have needs, they express needs to you and you go fill them. This is a great spot to be in as a startup! But at that point you're really just quasi-business programmers, and all Bob says is very applicable.<p>The guys I hear who do well always regret that they spend too much time on stuff that doesn't matter: coding, business plans, reading business books. Instead they should have just worked out more effective ways to find out what people want.<p>If you have a Minimum Viable Product that people want to pay money for, go code it. And do a good job of it, <i>because you've already determined that people are going to pay money for it</i>. So in that scenario, if you misunderstood your MVP, then all that TDD is going to be awesome when you refactor.<p>There's a third scenario that's being hinted at: you don't know what people might want, but you think you should code anyway to find out. This is like building a runway hoping that an airplane will suddenly have an emergency and need a place to land. I'd argue that you should either avoid this at all costs, or if you must code, write the cheapest, fastest throwaway crap you could imagine -- the odds are very, very high that you will never use or see that code again. If you do? You hit the lottery, and worrying about how badly you coded something is a ridiculous thing to get uptight about. Every second you spend creating an artificial world, whether that's a business plan, program, or sales chart, without validating with the customer is a waste of energy for an early startup.",1319720542

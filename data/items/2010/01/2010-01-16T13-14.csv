Get towards thirty and my, how the tables turn. Now, practically everyone I know (including me) is in a happy, stable, long-term relationship. <i>Nobody</i> I know fits that description. Of the ones that aren't, their main complaint is that they can't find a nice, down-to-earth mate. The very few people I am still in touch with who remain as superficial as you describe, are miserable.<p>The alpha-male / hot bitch thing works okay when everyone is looking for a one-night stand. When you get a little older and thoughts turn to finding someone to spend the rest of your life with, that sort of behavior just seems idiotic.",1263650250

A few months later I realized what had happened and tested how things looked in fixed width. Turns out I like proportional better.<p>A big difference was probably the fact that the codebase I was editing used tabs for indenting and had non-ascii art indenting rules (basically just indent the next line).",1263649788

I didn't know Clay Shirky was a feminist-apologist but I certainly grow tired of messages like this delivered from male bloggers about how women need to change, to do this or that or the other. This is a thin rewrite of a post that appeared I believe here on HN a few weeks back; only that post was actually written by a woman. These outside-looking-in pieces that male bloggers do are almost always a bad idea.",1263649601

But they also want high quality mates (which tend to be jerks, because they can afford to be, the same way they prettiest women tend to be bitches, because they can afford to be).  They're also more likely to dump a guy that's way too nice because he seems desperate, which means she could probably do better.<p>So the end result is that a woman might date the high quality male even though he's a jerk and dump the nice guy, simply because she's looking for quality.",1263648810

This is a zero-sum game.<p>That is, men being SAJ more than women is problematic because it means they will get more attention.  If men reduced their level of SAJ-hood to equal that of women, then men would have no advantage over women.  There would still be winners and losers, but they would be female and male in equal proportion (according to this theory).",1263648026

You can look at where they appear in the line, for one thing, and whether they're in clumps of two or more for another. In those cases it would be simple enough to make them align perfectly with the characters above/below them.<p>Of course, you'd have to decide which to do - above or below. There are reasonable heuristics for that, but they're probably more complicated and less accurate.<p>The nice thing about doing it this way is that it degrades perfectly when the code is viewed in fixed-width (which is good for tools and other developers).",1263647868

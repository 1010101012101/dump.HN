3333672,comment,3333565,3333565,3,0,scorchin,,,"As of Java 1.5, generics were added. Before generics you had to cast every object you read from a collection. If someone accidentally inserted an object of the wrong type  possible in the OP's example code  casts could fail at runtime.<p>With generics, you tell the compiler what types of objects are permitted in each collection. The compiler inserts casts for you automatically and tells you at <i>compile time</i> if you try to insert an object of the wrong type. This results in programs that are both safer and clearer. So please use generics when using the collections framework.<p>I'm now going to briefly run through the examples provided in OP's post and update them accordingly.<p><pre><code>  List<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>();\n  myList.add(""Second Thing"");\n  myList.add(""Second Thing"");\n  myList.add(""First Thing"");\n</code></pre>\nNote that I've used the interface form of <i>List</i> over a specialised type. This is so that any caller of a method which returns a collection can use the interface provided and they don't need to worry about the specific data structures you've used. This also means that you can update the underlying data structure without having to update any calling code. E.g. changing the above case from <i>ArrayList</i> to <i>LinkedList</i>.<p><pre><code>  Set<String> mySet = new HashSet<String>();\n  mySet.add(""Second Thing"");\n  mySet.add(""Second Thing"");\n  mySet.add(""First Thing"");\n</code></pre>\nIt is worth noting that Hashtable was <i>not originally</i> part of the Collections framework. It was retrofitted to conform to the Map interface in 1.2. You should instead use HashMap, which is the non-synchronized (sic) version of Hashtable. Although you can just as easily use Hashtable, the below example is just me being a little OCD.<p><pre><code>  Map<String, String> myMap = new HashMap<String, String>();\n  myMap.put(""a"", ""Second Thing"");\n  myMap.put(""b"", ""Second Thing"");\n  myMap.put(""c"", ""First Thing"");\n</code></pre>\n<i>EDIT</i>: Updated some sections to read clearer.",1323439031

3333637,comment,3333584,3333584,16,0,tokenadult,,,"""Dr Rachel Thompson, of the World Cancer Research Fund, said the report added to the 'now overwhelmingly strong evidence that our cancer risk is affected by our lifestyles.'<p>""Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said leading a healthy lifestyle did not guarantee a person would not get cancer but the study showed 'we can significantly stack the odds in our favour.'""<p>Many of these lines of evidence where developed originally by looking at environmental differences among different countries, as well as time series in cancer rates as lifestyles changed in countries over time, and comparisons of immigrants of varying ages of arrival (who adopt the lifestyles of new countries either as children or as adults) with relatives who stay in the old country. Then the best-understood models of cancer risk factors are further investigated through controlled experimentation on laboratory animals or on cell lines in vitro. Today it's plain enough that avoiding smoking, eating a varied, balanced diet, and maintaining normal weight through a combination of exercise and moderate eating offers substantial reduction of risk in all-cause mortality, including but not limited to death from cancer.<p>After edit: the second reply here asked how a diet higher rather than lower in fruits and vegetables can protect from cancers other than colon cancer. According to what I've read about the research, it's thought that some tendencies of healthy body cells to go into uncontrolled growth (cancer) are made worse by lack of micronutrients, which may be lacking in the diets of people who don't eat varied diets. It's also thought that the evolutionary arms race between plants (which tend to evolve tough husks but also phytotoxins as protections against being eaten) and animals (which have to eat some food source ultimately derived from autotrophic organisms, that is mostly plants) results in complex animals being selected for incidental adaptation of phytotoxins to kill off errant cell lines. What's poison in a large does can sometimes be medicine in the therapeutic dose and in the right time and place. All human beings eventually die of something, but the epidemiological evidence (and some laboratory evidence) shows that plant intake reduces chances of dying young of cancer, and these mechanisms are some of those suggested as reasons for that observation.",1323438153

3333630,comment,3327202,3327202,14,0,omegant,,,"I hope to give some light from the point of view of an airbus pilot( a320) also with B737 and MD80 experience.<p>First of all I must say that is very difficult to judge what happened from outside, there is a rush of adrenalin if some important alarm starts at the cockpit, it becomes worst if you are flying in the middle of the night and turbulence. Problems that would be solved or the solution evident seating at home in front of a computer, become suddenly a mistery or insolvable because you lost an stabilicer or any other physical problem to the plane( it has happened before).<p>The first obvious mistake is going through the thunderstorm in that lattitudes, I personally know the pilots who where flying in front of them and they took a 200miles reruting to avoid that particular thunderstorm ( as other trafics did).<p>Then the reaction to the lost of information : as has been said the proper way to react is using thrust power % and pitch positions, there are tables for different flight phases , they are located at the quick reference handbook, but they should be located at an sticker close to the instruments( for inmediate use as speed limits for flaps or landing gear). An automatic help for recovering such a problem would be greate but computers do fail regularly in comercial planes( if web servers that are seating in a room fail imagine something that is suffering high doses of vibration, dirt, humidity changes, temperature changes, you name it) and you there MUST be other options.<p>When flying that high you are at whats called coffin corner, that is you are so high that the wings will easily enter both high speed buffeting and low speed stall( both will produce a lost of altitude control, you fall but can do nothing to avoid it).\nAlso the engines don't have enougth thrust( as fighters do) to support the weight of the plane. So the maneuver they performed seemed to don't make sense at all, why would a pilot pull the stick to put the plane deeper in the cofin corner inside a thunderstorm?.<p>I think the cause is precisely training( and possibly other interface choices made by airbus helped too ), let me explain: there IS a maneuver inside thunderstorms wich is trained a lot AND will make the pilot PULL the sidestick and apply TOGA power, is called windshear( avoidment). Usually windshear is the wind state that you could find near a thunderstorm close to the airport. Is caused by the first descending burst( thunderstorm madurity) hitting the  ground (please google it as it is easier to see a picture than explain it). The result is that the big wind speed changes( in seconds) may put the plane suddenly in a stall \nsituation. Because it happens when you have no altitude left to recover from a stall ( maybe less than 3000 feet or closer than ten miles to the airport), your only possibility is to apply TOGA power and sidestick FULL back( the protections are NOT lost and then the plane takes care of the stall, the pilot takes care of the ground). This maneuver is practiced yearly ( or almost) as one of the most important ones ( with engine fail, traffic avoiding, depresurization), so it is my opinion ( I must say is not shared by many other pilots, many of them say it was the plane or simply don't know) and the simplest cause, that they simply were trying to fight a windshear, after all they were inside a thunderstorm and had to recover the control. That is way they simply couldn't understand ( or even hear the anouncement) why the plane was in stall, because they were folloing the procedure to the point. And procedures are to be followed if you do 't want problems with the plane and the judge( in a posterior investigation)<p>Also there are problems with the flight controls interface of airbus that have been known from the first a320 accident, and are highly polemic between pilots. Mainly airbus tried to reinvent the wheel at the cockpits,( and the rest of plane systems)in order to save weight. So they removed the link between the pilots controls ( except the rudder-fronwheel ones) and removed the possibility of the throttle levers to move acording to the power possition while in autopilot mode ( as boeing does ), after all only one pilot is taking the controls at a given time right?. But it is wrong, control feedback is fundamental in critical situations and has saved souls in the past. Also knowing the throttle possition at every moment just resting your hand at the levers while they move, gives you an amazing information of how the plane is behaving without having to look at the engine instruments ( there are one mm dots at the indicator showing the virtual ""possition"" of the levers, or where the thrust is going to move next), or simply overriding the autothrottle with out having to dissengage it. This throttle problem in particular has not caused a serious problem( that I am aware) yet, but give it time... Just imaging an autothrust setting the engines to iddle at 500' and the crew worried about having the runway insight in bad weather. The "" don't make me think"" principles still apply with airplanes ( and save lives, not only fuel) but airbus doesn't seem to bother too much.<p>I hope to have clarified a bit the problem from the Point of view of an airline pilot.<p>Pd. Sorry for all the misspellings, I am writting from my iphone. I'll edit at home.",1323438023

Mhz is useless as a measure for performance and it became popular only because of marketing campaigns by Intel, when they had an edge in the Mhz race. A more useful measure (other than running unbiased benchmarks) would be MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and MFLOPS (millions of floating-point instructions per second).<p>For example an ARM11 from 2002 at 412 MHz was able of 515 MIPS (millions instructions per second), while a Pentium Pro from 1996 was capable of 541 MIPS at 200 MHz.

Each is very dependent on the individual and firm.<p>In the US recruiters charge 15-30% of base and/or total comp...depends how good you are and your relationship with your client.  Good US recruiters bill 300K+, great recruiters bill 500K+, and avg recruiters will bill 100-200K.  How much you keep as an individual depends on the deal you have with your firm or if you are self employed.<p>The second part of the question ~ does being a developer make a person a better recruiter?  My initial answer would be 'no'.  In fact, I would argue that being a developer could hinder being a successful recruiter.<p>Understanding what your client is looking for is absolutely key to being successful.  However, the skills that make you a good devlpr are almost polar opposite the skills that make someone a good recruiter.  Being a recruiter takes a strong sales aptitude.<p>The other problem that comes to mind is a condition we, in the US, call 'experting'.  It happens when you're candidate has 60-90% of what the client is looking for, but because you're too focused on delivering perfection, and because you know what perfection is, you neglect to send this place-able candidate in for an interview.  Sometimes it's better to not know what you don't know.<p>Cheers",1323437767

I've worked with several academics and research labs trying to turn their research into startups, and you would not believe the attitudes prevalent in academia. The most common example of this I've seen is when professors bring up a potential competitor and state that the competitor does not have as much expertise (no founders with PhDs in the subject matter) as the professor, so the professor's new company should succeed wildly.<p>If the attitude present in this article was paid any mind by innovators, we would not have some things we truly love. My favorite example is ZFS. Built by prodigious hackers, not distributed filesystem experts by any means. I can't find the article anymore, but I remember reading that they felt their lack of expertise allowed them to approach the problem from a new angle, ignoring common wisdom.<p>My message to young entrepreneurs is this: Innovation doesn't work by experts expertly shaping the future incrementally. Innovation is messy. It works by lots of people - some experts, some not - trying to solve a problem. Almost everyone will fail, but you can't succeed if you don't try.",1323437731

273554,comment,273034,273513,0,0,kleneway,,,"In my opinion, yes, Google will keep crawling the web and indexing in a similar (but continually optimized) way for the foreseeable future.  Here's why - let's say you work at Google and come up with an entirely new way to do search.  Here are your options:
1 - Go to Larry/Sergi with the proposal to completely rip and replace millions/billions of dollars of infrastructure and knowledge in favor of a completely unproven new idea.  The cost and risk are so huge they'd never go for it.
2 - Go to an outside investor with the proposal to build it from scratch.  If it's truly an amazing, innovative new approach, they might fund it and you'd be able to build it from scratch without the political nightmare of trying to rewrite the core product of a multi-billion dollar public company.  This is exactly what both the Cuil and FriendFeed guys did (and yes, FriendFeed is very, very, very much a Google competitor).<p>One thing I always think about is in 100 years (or 1000 years), will we still be opening a web browser, typing a few words into the same plain Google text box, and hitting the ""Search"" button to get a page with 20 blue links and a bunch of ads?  I doubt it.  So there's definitely a better way to do search, we just haven't discovered it.  My personal opinion is that some combination of social search (i.e. FriendFeed) plus human-powered search (i.e. Wikia/Mahalo) plus semantic search (PowerSet) will be involved in the next evolution.  Of course, if I knew exactly what that looked like, I'd be on a beach right now instead of hanging out here on Hacker News.  :)",1218502609

Also, can I find an essentially unauthorized tethering app for a BB?
Also, if I get a BB, I'll have to ""hide"" that fact from T-mo, they use a different set of plans for them. (I don't need exchange server syncing, so I want the cheap data plan).

273551,comment,273206,273206,0,0,netcan,,,"I remember reading (couldn't find the link) that University texts were about the same price on kindle as hardcover. That has got to be a big mistake.<p>- University texts are expensive because of the short runs. Authors get only a couple of $ for $100 sales. 
- University texts are heavy. 
- Students are the ones carrying multiple books around daily. (all those scenarios of not needing to pack 10 books on holiday...)<p>Throw in the fact that students are a great segment to introduce these sorts of products to & it seems crazy that they haven't targeted colleges as the inroad for this product.<p>I mean if you could convince Universities that:
- Lecturers can prescribe aby books they want without worrying about being stuck with early editions or the print houses running out.
- Lecturers can publish books themselves without a minimum run & keep 4X the profit from 1/4 of the cost to students.<p>I mean they could almost make it a mandatory buy. Consider that over 3-4 years you spend approx $1000 (including buying & selling second hand), if they could sell college texts for $20, the total cost to students would be about 1/2 of the cost of hardcovers with reduced hassles.<p>Amazon seems not to give a damn about that market. I think that they didn't do well in negotiations with publishers. Apple might have done a better job there I think.",1218502521

The main thing I've missed on the 3650 is a keyboard. Actually coding on the system is prohibitively slow except for the shortest bug fixes or constant changes.

They really don't have any other choice. Its not like a businessman in his 50s with a startup idea, will want to spend thousands of hours learning to code his project. And for what? To have a crappy little site because you don't know half the tricks, and don't know where to go to find help.<p>Also the whole ""you must have quick changes to succeed"" is overblown. Sure a hacker will probably be able to roll out a new change a week earlier, but how much can you really gain during that 1 week?<p>And in the long run the businessman will win, because while you are busy spending your whole day coding that one extra feature, the business guy can focus on running his business, while his agency works on the feature requests based on his requirement document and mock ups.",1218501997

I want to put in a url of a gallery I want to keep. Not just simply a bookmark, but the service should rip the photos and store it. As it stands right now, I'll probably never revisit the photo gallery or I'll have to come up with a way to rip it myself.<p>Most photosharing sites are about sharing not consuming or 'collecting'.

273513,comment,273034,273034,0,0,tom234,,,"I wanted to post a general discussion going about creating a search engine since the Ycombinator crowd is a good crowd. How do you guys see Google scaling in comparison with how the web is expanding so much? Do you think they will keep indexing the web and adding new content? I personally don't see that to be very scalable. What do you think Google is thinking about the future in terms of incorporating so many webpages into its index. Obviously Google is using a ""pull"" mechanism where it crawls and indexes. Do you guys see like ""push"" mechanism like RSS that will work better and how would that affect the search result? Is there any way besides index to achieve a different kind of search engine? Another kind of content retrieval system is like the Digg where the user ""pushes"" the content to Digg and therefore it is supposedly more relevant and interesting, but the disadvantage of that becoming a search engine is there isn't a lot of content that the user submits compared with like Google. For instance Digg cannot support query like ""c# string replace"" while Google will do that very easily because it crawled and indexed the MSDN api pages already, while Digg users might never submit that same page to Digg. My main concern is supporting so many content with different query and being very comprehensive search engine like Google without this huge index and crawling restriction? Any clues? I'm not dreaming about this and I actually want to make it a reality somehow.",1218499480

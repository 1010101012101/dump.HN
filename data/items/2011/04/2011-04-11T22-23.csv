Or ""near the sea"" can't be translated as ""bij de zee"" but has to be translated to ""vlakbij de zee"". A lot of them are context dependent as well, and don't make sense the way they are presented.<p>""Forward"" is one I kept running into, it can be translated in two different ways depending on the context, ""naar voren"" or ""vooruit"" (BTW, define: vooruit in Google doesn't give you anything, search in de Dikke Van Dale a Dutch Dictionary).

First, provide progress updates while building. Once you're done building and you decide to approach them again, re-iterate the pain points and benefits and try to build back that initial excitement. Also, read up on the principle of consistency in sales (for example pick up the book Influence by Cialdini). The idea is this: if you initially got a written and public commitment from the prospects, then those prospects will keep their word. They may also be less willing to flatter you given that kind of a commitment.",1302562761

I don't have a link to his comment, but it was mentioned in another thread few days ago. To me his position confirms that the voting function currently sits with one butt on two chairs, and this may be the root of the fanboy-style mass-upvoting problem with comments (that, again, was pointed out by pg not few days ago).",1302559530

Think about an advanced file converter, or maybe a one-off fax service. There are also the more traditional use cases, such as purchasing a single article from an online journal, or streaming a single movie online.<p>Minno provides an effective alternative to monetize these services, and it does so with much more ease than with traditional payment systems.",1302559471

Maybe I was unclear.)<p>I am what you might call an autodidact. When I observe an institution isn't sufficiently good, I pivot and fulfill my requirements elsewhere, for example by reading a book or meeting passionate people informally. I do not believe that this autodidacticism is great efficiency-wise, but often it's unfortunately better than alternatives.<p>When evaluating the earlier poster's anecdote of teaching 180 adults, of course it's very unlikely that she/he had the terrible luck to draw 180 (or even 100) genetic freaks who were born with terrible attitudes. (And even if she/he did, just wait a semester and problem solved!) Far more likely to me: at least one major institution failed them along the way. So it is clearly useful to identify which ones failed  especially if it's the one you're in, as that's the one you have most control over. (Teachers in particular have a position of power in the classroom.)<p>(The power of institutional analysis is you can completely replace the people in them, and they'll still function essentially the same.)<p>More important  if you realize that your approach is clearly unsuccessful, I think you need to stop, reevaluate and probably pivot. Be open to shattering your worldview. Rather than plod on stubbornly in a direction you know leads to abject failure, because most people around you are willing to fail miserably in the same way. (Or because ""But it's not in my job description!"") I do not intend to be such an extreme romanticist of failure. In fact, today I happened to institute post-mortems at work, to identify our little failures. Not to blame, but to improve.<p>It is important for teachers to have good attitudes, and it's disheartening to meet those ironically unwilling to learn. But I've met wonderful teachers.",1302559470

We all acknowledge this behavior when advising startups to ship products and learn on the way. This group is no different; the main difference is, that it grows too fast to learn from old members and reading a guideline can be compared to reading a book about startups versus doing it. Here are my suggestions I hope they will be helpful:<p>for all new users and all existing users with karma<100<p>* on create account page give link to Guidelines to read and before signing up give us a quiz with 20 questions to assess our understanding of the most important ones. This would also give us a clear message that attitude and quality is very important on HN.<p>for all users<p>* rename ""comments"" to ""thoughts"" and add ""chat"" link to convore/wompt for a relaxed discussion. From ""chats"" users can deduct quality material to ""thougts"" for history value.<p>for users with karma<100<p>* include explanations on down-votes so we can understand our mistakes an learn from them. Give us a chance to become better rather then killing us and wait for us to reappear as yet another troll.<p>* make submit button on ""thoughts"" to countdown 10 seconds (with bail-out option) to give us time to rethink if the post is really useful",1302559297

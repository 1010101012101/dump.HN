8151670,comment,8151464,8151519,5,0,downandout,,,"The big issue isn&#x27;t engineering, it&#x27;s licensing.  In the words of the attorney that helped me with a Nevada gaming license application, &quot;They really want to make sure you&#x27;re clean before they give you a license to steal&quot;.  For example, if you went to high school in Hawaii, they will send two gaming agents to Hawaii - on your dime - to interview your high school teachers.  The process is long and expensive.<p>And that&#x27;s just Nevada.  You have to be licensed in each individual jurisdiction where your games will be shipped. This, of course, is all before you even broach the subject of putting your game on casino floors with slot/table game managers.<p>As far as revenue models, both of those you mentioned are used.  This also goes back to licensing - if you are only licensed as a <i>manufacturer</i> (a slightly less onerous process) then you cannot get a percentage of profits.  You must have an <i>operating</i> license to obtain a percentage.  This is why many table game manufacturers (3 Card Poker etc) get a flat fee per table per day instead of a percentage.  The machine market is dominated by IGT and WMS, and good luck penetrating it.  You may, however, be able to develop a fun game and license it to one of the big slot firms.  Probably the easiest way.",1407477427

8151635,comment,8151464,8151519,27,0,joezydeco,,,"I worked in the business for a number of years and still have friends/colleagues that are there.<p>From an engineering perspective slot machine design isn&#x27;t very hard at all.  It&#x27;s pretty much video game design.  There&#x27;s a relatively recent CPU putting down images, playing back video, doing some light/sound choreography, and maybe doing some mechanical motion on some games.  Let&#x27;s put it as slightly more complex than Candy Crush but way less complex than writing Halo.  There&#x27;s also a mechanical component with artists and designers making cabinets, art glass, and wacky add-ons that sit on top or around the machine.<p>The hard work in slot machine design is in the <i>math</i> of the slot machine.  You&#x27;re trying to design a game that balances something interesting on-screen with enough volatility that keeps players hooked.  If you decimate their bank in the first 100 spins that player will never come back.  One typical way to manipulate this is through the secondary games or bonus games that pop up on certain reel combinations.  At first this was a way to work around certain patents (the most famous being IGT&#x27;s <i>Telnaes</i> patent) and now players just come to expect various levels of extra action when certain slot reels are hit.  Every player likes something different, of course.  IGT&#x27;s <i>Double Diamonds</i> reel-spinning slot is over 25 years old and players still look for it.<p>The math also has to jive with the gaming board.  Certain states will mandate minimum payout percentages, or a mixture of these that average a certain payout.  (This is why dollar slots in Vegas pay way better than penny slots.  As long as all the action in the casino averages to the legal minimum, they&#x27;re okay).  Your typical slot manufacturer has a number of math/stat MS or PhDs working out the numbers on paper as well as a testing department that tries to verify the math empirically.  I&#x27;ll say &quot;tries&quot; because some designs are so complex and non-deterministic or dependent on player choice that it can&#x27;t be verified entirely on paper anymore.  Almost all American jurisdictions employ independent gaming labs that inspect the code and verify the math as well before the slot is approved to release in a given state.  If you can get approved in Nevada, you&#x27;re usually good everywhere as a rule of thumb.<p>And then yes, the theme of the slot has also become incredibly important.  Licensing pop culture items (movies, TV shows, dead musicians, celebrities, etc etc etc) is a constant fight between the manufacturers to capture and leverage into a usable slot idea.  Some think it is creatively lazy to grab the next hot movie and turn it into a slot.  Some think that&#x27;s what you need to do to attract people&#x27;s attention in a visually crammed environment.  C&#x27;est la vie.<p>A slot machine designer worth his salt can mix and meld all of these things into an interesting game.  New and different game mechanics are hard to come by, though.  When something <i>does</i> hit, you&#x27;ll see that model replicated dozens of times with slightly different math or new themes slapped on top of it.  You throw a lot of shit at the wall to see what sticks.<p>Business wise, up until a few decades ago, slots were sold by manufacturers and entirely owned by the casinos.  In the last 20 years or so this has transitioned into a participation relationship where the manufacturers own, maintain, and operate the games themselves and share a percentage of the handle with the casino.  This has made the business a lot more cutthroat because a streak of lousy games can get you kicked off a property (or corporation) entirely.  This is the downside of throwing shit at the wall, so you test and test continuously at smaller properties.  Participation also allows interesting game mechanics like multi-casino slots (like Megabucks) where the manufacturer is holding the jackpot in an interest-bearing account in their reserves.  Think about that when the jackpot is in 9 figures and nobody has hit it for a year.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;re really interested, the big companies are always hiring.  These days it&#x27;s IGT in Reno, NV and WMS in Chicago, IL.  There are smaller companies here and there (Konami, Aristocrat, Mikohn) and then a constellation of independent design groups that consult and design games on spec for the big dogs.  Most designers work their way up from programming games or designing art for slots but if you have any video game or casual game experience there&#x27;s always room for new talent.",1407476661

8151563,comment,8151464,8151464,2,0,unsignedint,,,"So some thought about this, as I used to be regular of a local casino, not because I felt I had to go, just to play with cash vouchers, they used to send, maybe occasionally putting in a 10 dollar bill or two. I didn&#x27;t make money out of it, but I did not lose my own money. I guess when they realized they are not making money from me, they stopped sending me those vouchers... Bummer! :-)<p>Those machines are really designed to salami slice players. You can play many of those machines from a penny per line, which equates to about 15 to 30 cents per play for full lines, depending on a machine. There are people who play at higher stakes, like a max bet of $2 per play, or even $5, but observing people, majority seems to be played at much lower bet of a penny or two per line, so I&#x27;m guessing they consists of high fraction of profit a casino is making from.<p>It&#x27;s fairly easy to lose a sense of spending when you are doing literally a thousand play per hour. (At 30 cents per play, You&#x27;d be spending fairly long time to spend $20, or even $10. At this level, a typical win would get you around $2 to $5, maybe $40 if you are quite lucky -- and perhaps real jackpot, being very, very rare, $200 or so.) Those &quot;wins&quot; really give you the joy that you&#x27;d anticipate for the next, and a lot of time, they&#x27;d put more money in just to anticipate another win, because when they have lost plenty of money, it&#x27;s about a time they will start winning, right?<p>Knowing someone who really got into it, one sign I started seeing from them is that they&#x27;d start making a statement like &quot;I&#x27;m not playing it for money, I play it because the game is fun.&quot; He would play the game literally for hours per session, often visiting there multiple times a week. Usually ends up losing -- maybe the only good thing is that he&#x27;d have accumulated quite a bit of free restaurant credits.<p>So if you are inclined to play, here&#x27;s some suggestions, though for those people who would feel these suggestions are useful probably find the best is not to play at all:<p>1) Set a budget -- don&#x27;t bring extra money. (And don&#x27;t bring ATM card/credit card if you feel like you can&#x27;t resist getting extra money out of them...)<p>2) Record every win/lose -- I&#x27;ve had Google Doc that keeps track of every wins/lose every machine. Every time I cash in, I&#x27;d record, every time I cash out, I also record that, that would give me balance sheet how much I&#x27;m spending/making.<p>3) Bet generously -- Don&#x27;t bet a penny per line, go higher. You won&#x27;t go anywhere with such low bet anyways. You&#x27;ll have a better chance getting a better outcome going through that $20 in 2 minutes than spending 2 hours on it. Yeah, it may only last 2 minutes, but then you have good reason (See #1) to leave at that point -- and you are giving less chance for a machine to alter your psychology.",1407474937

8151542,comment,8151464,8151464,7,0,GuiA,,,"I come from a country where casinos are much rarer than they are in the US, and I recently went in my first casino ever after living in the US for 4+ years.<p>So I entered this weird place in Montana, with colorful machines everywhere. A more experienced friend instructed me to play a certain machine, in which I put $5 and got 100 virtual &quot;tokens&quot; in exchange. Then the machine asked me to pick 7 random numbers from a 10x10 grid. I touched the 7 numbers, and pressed a flashy &quot;Go&quot; button. The machine &quot;randomly&quot; (of course I have no certainty that it was truly a random process) picked 7 numbers, and only 1 of mine matched. Total gains: 0. I repeated the process several dozen times: select your numbers, press a button, watch the machine make funky sounds as it &quot;randomly&quot; selects number, see if yours match. The best round I got was when 3 of mine matched, and I got back something like 10 credits, going from 47 to 57. 10 minutes later, I was at 0.<p>It strikes me as a tragedy of our modern society that such contraptions make for a significant portion of state income, and that they are as popular as they are. It is sad that the average American citizen does not have a sufficient grasp of basic probabilities to even consider putting money in such a machine, because it means that the school system essentially fails at preparing kids for the real world. And it is sad that governments are encouraging those temples for theft to prosper the way they do. Because it really is theft - just a kind of theft where the victim is coaxed into it with the help of smoke, mirrors, and free booze (not unlike the phone scams that prey on the elderly and manage to extract thousands of dollars from them). And not only is it institutionalized theft, it is institutionalized <i>classist</i> theft, as the vast majority of the victims are from the lowest socio-economical classes of society.",1407474330

8151537,comment,8148703,8148703,3,0,Houshalter,,,"I found this on wikipedia which is interesting:<p>>The appearance of a man-made pit has been attributed partly to the texture of sinkholes: &quot;this filling would be softer than the surrounding ground, and give the impression that it had been dug up before&quot;,[38] and the appearance of &quot;platforms&quot; of rotten logs has been attributed to trees or &quot;blowdowns&quot; falling or washing into the depression.[39] An undetermined pit similar to the description of the early Money Pit had been discovered in the area. In 1949, workmen digging a well on the shore of Mahone Bay, at a point where the earth was soft, found a pit of the following description: &quot;At about two feet down a layer of fieldstone was struck. Then logs of spruce and oak were unearthed at irregular intervals, and some of the wood was charred. The immediate suspicion was that another Money Pit had been found.&quot;[40]",1407474166

Since I started working freelance, I wanted to have a good designer as my go-to person, could find someone reliable and good enough for my standards. So I made my girlfriend who was always good at drawing (fresh out of uni with an unrelated masters at the time) learn photoshop, illustrator and a few other tools. She&#x27;s ace with vector graphics, her psd/ai files are a pleasure to work with, she&#x27;s creative and intelligent (I&#x27;m biased, but seriously). I actually managed to pull it off and make her a good designer for a developer to work with.<p>This worked well for us, for the last 2 years, she would help me out when I needed her and find work via Elance when I didn&#x27;t need any design services.<p>In the last few months, I&#x27;ve been focusing more on optimising and reworking existing applications, making them faster and more efficient for my ongoing clients, so I haven&#x27;t needed a designer for a while and about a week ago, Elance closed her account out of the blue, her feedback was flawless, great ratings, top 10% on lots of tests. We tried emailing them a few times, but after googling and finding out that they just drop hordes of accounts from time to time we understood that it&#x27;s a complete waste of time.<p>So I ask you HN, where could I point her?

I am not enrolled in the program, I am just taking the courses for free by watching the lecture notes and doing the short quizzes.<p>Pros:<p>1. It provides good breadth of knowledge around what is possible.<p>2. The style is engaging and the videos are short and well made. I have tried to take Coursera courses before, but always ended up dropping out after the first couple of lectures.<p>3. It gives you a specific goal; most of the nanodegree courses are geared towards completing a specific project.<p>4. I was able to quickly get my personal website up and running (I believe in using completely static HTML + CSS, JS when required, and the courses helped me to learn enough to quickly hack together something just using Notepad++).<p>5. I have plans to enroll for a Nanodegree later. It is quite affordable even for people in developing countries (like me), after accounting for exchange rate fluctuations and cost of living.<p>Cons:<p>1. The courses don&#x27;t go too deep, and you won&#x27;t become a master unless you are motivated enough to do the work yourself (e.g. Introduction to jQuery - it gives a flavour of what is possible to do with jQuery, but does not go into any depth if you want to be an expert).<p>2. What you get out of the course if entirely up to your motivation in improving yourself. Completing the courses alone won&#x27;t be enough to pick up a new skill.",1442662127

We&#x27;d review them, and I&#x27;d point out some problems we&#x27;d have cross-browser, or limitations of JS interaction at that time, and we&#x27;d iterate some ideas.

They could <i>know</i> something was actually <i>not possible</i> to recreate in pixel-perfect fashion across IE3,4,5, NS2,3,4, WebTV and Opera, because they had experienced a site was more than displaying a single JPG file on a website with a massive HTML map area (did a couple of those WAY early on - insane).<p>Don&#x27;t send me a photoshop file with 280 layers, one for each rounded corner on the 17 round corner boxes with too-small text which only looks good on your 30 inch triple monitors please.

While they can still provide reasonable security against random attackers, they cannot provide any significant security against organizations (such as intelligence agencies) who can offer millions of dollars for exclusive access to unpatched exploits and MITM any connection.<p>You can install Qubes [<a href=""https://www.qubes-os.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.qubes-os.org</a>] if you want a system that makes it more convenient and secure to use virtual machines this way (and you trust its authors to not have backdoored it).<p>Furthermore, you should only install software from official sources and when you install software, you should make sure to check its digital signature or hash (from a separate virtual machine, since the one you are browsing with is potentially compromised as discussed above)<p>If you don&#x27;t already have a trusted signing key stored on your machine, you should download the file itself or something guaranteeing its integrity if available (signing key, HTTPS certificate, file hash) from multiple Internet connections, such as a residential ISP, mobile ISP and multiple instances of Tor and make sure the downloaded data is the same. This is very likely to foil a targeted attack specifically designed to give a special trojaned version of the file or a replaced signing key under the attacker&#x27;s control.<p>Of course it&#x27;s impossible to defend against the original authors of the software being malicious or compromised themselves, or against an attack designed to give everyone maliciously altered software when you don&#x27;t have a trusted key/certificate, but those are more likely to be discovered. Even if the downloaded software is malicious, if you are separating software by virtual machine as described above, the damage will be limited to the virtual machine the software runs in.<p>There are a lot of other things to consider, such as defending from physically targeted attacks (e.g. someone breaking in your home and installing a keylogger) if you are not anonymous and keeping your anonymity if you are.",1442660911

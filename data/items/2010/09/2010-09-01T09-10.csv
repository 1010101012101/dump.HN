Someone good will have so many projects that they could never remember every detail of each of them, so every second you've spent burning this into your brain will be wasted.<p>It's much better to use the tools as far as you can [1], use nice big descriptive names (since you never have to actually type them out this is win-win) and try to be as consistent as possible [2].  For projects I've been the driver on I never have to look at anything.  I know how the project is going to be laid out, what the naming scheme will be like, etc.  I can e.g. open up the Visual Studio solution file, Ctrl+n, type in the capital letters of the class I know will be of interest (e.g. WRI for WidgetRepositoryImplementation) and off I go.  While you're still birthing out your first class I'll already be tightening up my tests.<p>And there are people vastly better/faster than I am at this.<p>[1] But be sensible about this.  For me, big code generators are a no go.  I use spring because it (a) doesn't sprinkle it's code anywhere I have to see and (b) regenerates the code every time so there is no sync issue between changing a source and regenerating a dependency.<p>[2]  Always refactor when you touch code, including making the code consistent with current coding standards.",1283334729

Diesel engines use a roughly constant amount of fuel up to maybe 25-50% load, and then increase specific fuel use fairly slowly up to the efficient design level (which is probably highway cruise for most truck engines), and then increase specific fuel use much more quickly to peak power.  (this depends a lot on the engine, and turbo/supercharged engines can have a wider band of efficiency)<p>By using an electric battery, and then charging it during normal use of the truck on-road, you change from a long duration inefficient use of the main engine, to a slight increase in power used during cruise (and it's a load which can be shut off instantly -- so you could run the charger during low-stress cruise, keeping the truck at maximum efficiency, or even run it entirely on regenerative braking in a future generation of the product).<p>Another option would be keeping a small Diesel APU on the truck to run rather than idling the main engine, but there are other benefits (noise, environmental) to the electric system.  Given the right charging<p>The main penalty here is cost/complexity/weight of the system (which adds to fuel costs), but long-haul truckers pretty much sleep in their trucks every day, so it looks like it pays for itself quickly.<p>The other main system I've seen is ""IdleAir"" -- it's electricity, internet, and HVAC delivered by a flexible conduit into the truck.  A central system at a truck stop provides it to all the trucks.<p>When I go on road trips (in a car), I've often wished for something similar -- I take breaks from driving every 2-4h, and sometimes to sleep overnight in rest stops, and being able to plug in and get power/internet/hvac without idling my car would be great.  In some climates it's ok to sleep in a car without running HVAC, but in 130F sunlight, or -40F cold, that's not really an option.",1283331773

Sometimes I can't avoid it, like when I'm at work.",1283331764

""southampton to edinburgh next month"" and it returned results for London Gatwick to Edinburgh.<p>Flight search is a very competitive online service, accuracy of results is key.  The everyday user who receives poor results just simply wont bother returning.",1283331665

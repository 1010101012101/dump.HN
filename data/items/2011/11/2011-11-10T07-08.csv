I am not happy with Unity when it comes to serious work<p>1. It is not easy for me to switch between instances of the same application immediately. I usually open code in 3 or 4 gedit windows and switch between them often using Alt+Tab when I am not using eclipse. This has become very hard with Unity, Most of the time my fingers starts aching after working for a while in Ubuntu.<p>2. Opening multiple instance of an application is also not that comfortable. Suppose I have opened a file manager to see the contents of the Downloads folder and when I click on the Home folder icon from the Unity menu it takes me to the Downloads folder which is already open. I have to select File -> New window to open another instance of the same application.<p>I had tried XFCE and KDE but I prefer GNOME. I did some searching and came up with two choices Fedora 16 or Linux Mint.<p>In these Linux Mint came as a winner and I decided to give it a try this weekend since it is debian based and it comes with GNOME2 and the promised support for GNOME2 when it switches to GNOME3.<p>Things that kept me away from Fedora 16 are GNOME3 (I have not tried but read some reviews on it, I read one post where Linus had expressed his distaste for GNOME3 and telling XFCE would be better) and unfamiliar package system (this is not a big excuse, rpm is also as matured as apt and I think I can learn that easily). If someone tried Fedora 16 and if they feel GNOME3 had improved plz leave a note.<p>I think I am not the only one and  many people are thinking about migrating from Ubuntu to Linux Mint.",1320911314

Although some good could come from consumer pressure and boycotting, it's very hard to tell what the net effect would be. The way to get a real impact on the core problems here is to improve the cultural and economic conditions in the countries where exploitation happens.<p>I guess my argument is that although it is comfortable to believe it, consumers in the West actually have very little power over the wrongs that happen in the name of economic development in developing countries.

""myfile.scm"") and how to enable readline support, but it wasn't obvious at first. On my laptop also running Ubuntu, DrRacket is usable but strangely (enter! ...) raises an error. This gives the impression that the whole environment is not well polished.

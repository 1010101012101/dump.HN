9331606,comment,9328518,9330169,0,0,rbehrends,,,"> 1. Local branches<p>Local branches are really an artifact of Git having a garbage collector. That means that any commit that you want to keep must be attached to a branch so that it may not be inadvertently lost. Without a garbage collector, that is not necessary.<p>In particular, in many other VCSs, you just simply commit without having to create a branch in the first place. Labeling them (via whichever mechanisms your VCS provides) is typically optional with modern version control systems.<p>You can argue that you prefer having a garbage collector over having to explicitly delete commits/branches that you do not want any longer, but that would be a different issue.<p>> 2. Mercurial, without extensions, doesn&#x27;t have the git shelf.<p>This is sort of incorrect -- or rather, probably a misunderstanding. Shelve is part of standard Mercurial and has been for a while (same goes for MQ). While it is disabled by default and enabled in the extensions section, it&#x27;s no more an extension in any meaningful sense of the word than git stash (which technically calls out to a shell script [1]). Mercurial&#x27;s shelf is a python module [2] that is loaded when you flip a switch.<p>> Both these points make hg easier to learn (branch == clone is very easy to wrap your head around, commit behaves basically like svn/cvs).<p>This is really more a feature of Bazaar, not Mercurial.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/git-stash.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/git-stash.sh</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://selenic.com/repo/hg-stable/file/default/hgext/shelve.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://selenic.com/repo/hg-stable/file/default/hgext/shelve....</a>",1428371171

9331581,comment,9330076,9331421,0,0,baghira,,,"1. I would argue that this is a paper that <i>intentionally</i> goes into detail with regard to the history of statics. After all the main problem here is not how to compute p-values, nor the choice of the threshold (well, that may very well be a problem, but it&#x27;s a different one) but rather the interpretation, and history is often important for interpretation, even in physics.\nIf one wants a really compact way to convince people that the way they are thinking about p-values is wrong I&#x27;d go with the point raised by Steven Goodman in &quot;A Dirty Dozen: Twelve P-Value Misconceptions&quot;: since the p-value is computed under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true it <i>cannot</i> be the probability that the null hypothesis is true, by definition.<p>2. As far as what the difference is, I have to admit I have not found a memorable phrase to explain it. Both Goodman in &quot;Toward Evidence-Based Medical Statistics&quot; and this paper give a similar wording of the difference, which i would rephrase as follows.<p>The p-value works by inference, taking the data and assigning a probability to that data, not to an hypothesis. It is to be used to corroborate our disbelief in the null, i.e. informally. To use inference to test hypothesis one must use Bayes&#x27; Theorem, i.e. Bayes factors, and introduce prior probabilities.\nHypothesis testing à la Neyman and Pearson is deductive process, in which one does assign probabilities to the hypotheses, paying the price of only being able to minimize the errors commited, not to draw inferences.<p>One should also confront &quot;In Fisher’s approach the researcher sets up a null hypothesis that a sample comes from a hypothetical infinite population with a known sampling distribution.&quot; with &quot;Neyman–Pearson results are predicated on the assumption of repeated random sampling from a defined population.&quot;<p>Given the natural predisposition by students to works in an inferential manner, it may be wise to bite the bullet and teach Bayes factor instead of the p-value cargo cult (this being a pedagogical choice, not an assessment of frequentism vs. bayesianism or a critique of p-values as conceived by Fischer).",1428370722

Instead all assets bundled with your app are served using Ruby and dyno time. While a simple and clean architecture, this either raises the cost or forces you to place static assets on other servers (or use CDNs). And you&#x27;ll still need to debug someone else&#x27;s stack just as much -- when you get a service-specific error for exceeding memory limits or having requests take too long because of instance-level queues, etc.<p>At this point, I never pick PaaS because it&#x27;s less work, I pick it simply because I&#x27;ve used it before and it&#x27;s easy to get started with.

I guess there was a time when Japanese culture enthusiastically adopted technology and culture from outside of Japan, but I don&#x27;t see this too much anymore. Remember that Apple had to go to great lengths to even get the iPhone on sale here - up to that point, while mobile phones here might have been great in the 90s or whatever, innovation had basically stagnated in that space. There is the fax thing in the article. I can tell you that in the financial sector here there are a great number of customs and practices that were abandoned by the rest of the world twenty or thirty years ago in the name of efficiency. Remember that MiniDisc remained a big deal here well into the 2000s - even ten years ago few people in Japan knew what an MP3 player was (again, until Apple basically forced the iPod onto the market here).<p>So new tech can be adopted here, but you <i>really</i> have to go to unreasonably great lengths to prove it out before shops and distributors will work with you - and the price of being wrong is really high. And you can multiply this by a factor of ten if your company is not Japanese. Japanese remind me of the Amish in this respect, actually - of course, it has nothing to do with religion. I think it is a side effect of Japanese exceptionalism and various Nihonjinron bullshit that continues to be a big deal for the Japanese. In fact, I suspect this is getting <i>worse</i>, although it&#x27;s certainly possible I just notice it more now. Even if a thing is successful everywhere else, even if everyone finds a thing very useful (or, in the case of fax per the article, hopelessly outdated), the Japanese will reject it without consideration, or cling to it beyond the point of reason, with no justification aside from, well, they&#x27;re Japanese so <i>obviously</i> things that work <i>everywhere else</i> can&#x27;t work <i>here</i>, and vice versa.<p>It is an exceptionally stupid meme and it&#x27;s holding back the entire society.

Most of the implementations of library specific things can be found at [1], so if you find a feature in C++14 that you&#x27;re missing, go ahead and search the draft standard files (most of which are verbatim the same implementation) and copy into your own project.<p>To be fair though, one of the bigger features of C++11 / C++14 brings to the table is just easier template / std::algorithm usage (via lambdas), and smart pointers. Beyond that, most things aren&#x27;t as necessary or as widespread in use even within std / STL. So for the most part, if you (or parent) has been interested in learning some modern C++, for the most part you can start leveraging a lot of the more useful tools / tricks immediately, even if the compilers haven&#x27;t fully implemented C++14 yet [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://isocpp.org/files/papers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://isocpp.org/files/papers/</a><p>[2] My understanding is that libc++ and clang are fully caught up, but g++ / libstdc++ won&#x27;t be 100% C++14 compliant until after gcc-5.0.

Is there really a fundamental difference between shipping a Docker container to a set of servers, or just relaunching/rebuilding servers?<p>There&#x27;s two perspectives to this:<p>* From a user&#x27;s perspective, ignoring performance implications, containers should be the same as VMs.<p>* From a hardware perspective however, containers are much more lightweight in terms of CPU, Ram and Disk space, since they all share at least the kernel.<p>Why should you care? Well if something is less resource consuming, it means that (a) you could run it for less than what you pay for VMs or (b) it can be sold to you for less. There&#x27;s some additional benefits like fast &quot;boots&quot;, strict decoupling of persistant and non-persistant storage (which I find an advantage, restarting a container cleans up whatever you don&#x27;t care for), but at the end I think it comes down to money.",1428369478

It&#x27;s nice to find a person who recognizes what I had to say.<p>I also find farming to be one of the best systems to help us understand how to lead our lives. I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;ll understand this, but I want to tell you that there&#x27;s a fundamental principle by which the world exists and operates. If we can really open our eyes to this principle, we can recognize everything in the world, and we can also find the way to whatever result we want. I like the practical, living example of doing farming because the process in which plant life reproduces and can be cultivated is a very distinctive example of this principle. In the world, something that exists once has its will to keep existing, and it tries to make itself keep existing through its own activities. As a matter of fact, things in the world exist on the basis of what they keep inside of themselves. We can see this fact clearly through a simple plant, like a bean. A certain bean came from a previous bean. If we try planting a bean, whether or not it can sprout and yield new, viable beans depends on both the integrity of the bean we plant (the nature of which was made by past activities of the ancestor plants), and the environment (the quality of the farmland, and the care provided by the farmer). When we closely study how changing these two factors changes the quality of the result (fruit) we get, we can approach complete understanding of the system. I just wanted to say that farming is a great example because the same principle inside farming also exists in every other aspect of life. The problem is how we can improve our ability to see what exists in front of us in any given case. As you may already know, understanding something rationally is completely different from being able to see it with one&#x27;s own eyes.",1428368428

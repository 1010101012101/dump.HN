They made an (it sounds like) informal contract with a procrastinating college sophomore, in the middle of a busy school term.  Occam’s razor would suggest the delays were caused by disinterest, procrastination, and the busy-ness of his schedule, not malice or greed.<p>These guys were supposedly working on their site (of a relatively simple and obvious idea) for a year, with nothing to show for it, and their conclusion is: “'That's supposed to be us.' We're not there, because one greedy kid cut us out.""”  As if the 10 hours of work Zuckerberg didn’t do on their site was the only thing separating failure from unbelievable riches.",1213405135

The touchstone is whether or not what a company projects is decided by marketing strategy in isolation or by business development as a whole.  Ideally, these are one in the same, but they rarely actually are coincidental.",1213404607

It's not mysterious. Instead of seeing the obvious, the blogger seems to imply that somehow godaddy magicked into existence a company with a related name as a front to buy his 9.99 domain name.",1213404266
217277,comment,217162,217203,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"Lua is designed for exactly the type of work you describe here. I wrote a Lua interface for The Nebula Device (Open-sourced 3d game engine from Radon Labs.) It took about a weekend, starting from scratch. Interfacing to C or C++ code is dead simple. And the language itself draws a lot of inspiration from Scheme without abandoning a more familiar syntax. You get first-class functions, closures, lexical scoping, coroutines, and a clever ""metamethod"" system for defining object behavior. It's an extremely quick and efficient implementation written in strict ANSI C, and it works well in constrained environments like games. It's quite popular in both console and PC games for higher level functions on top of a low level engine. Give Lua a look-see!",1213404025

There may be .NET client applications which use Amazon S3 for storage but as far as I know there is no good solution for running a .NET application on Amazon EC2.<p>If you do find any examples, please post them here.",1213403989

217271,comment,217162,217162,0,0,qwph,,,"One bug I had to fix recently was in the commentary system of a PS2 soccer game (with an ancient codebase, parts of which hadn't been touched in 10 years).<p>The commentator would always refer to a particular player on a particular team by the name of a different player on that team. No-one had any idea why.<p>This issue had been knocking around for years and somehow ended up on my plate. After about 3 or 4 days of digging around and finding nothing, I finally got to the bottom of it. It just so happened that subtracting the ID's of the two players in question gave exactly 65536. It didn't take me much longer to figure out that the game's database used 32 bit integers for player ID's, and the commentary system was using 16 bit integers, so from the commentary's point of view, the two players had the same ID.<p>Luckily for me, I was able to fix it by swapping in a slightly-less-ancient commentary system which used 32 bit IDs instead.",1213402614

When I want to know if a domain is available I do a DNS lookup on it's NS records instead of using their web interface or whois. It will just hit the root servers and no registrar will know that I did this. Maybe it is paranoia, but I too have lost some domains that I wanted in exactly the same way you describe.",1213402538

Learn the database layer, learn how to write sql, learn how to break down your problem into a database model, and be able to think about it in terms of rows and columns in a database.<p>All the database stuff that you learn is going to scale pretty linearly with any type of web application that you're doing.  That is, the more database stuff that you learn the more you're going to know about web programming.",1213401699

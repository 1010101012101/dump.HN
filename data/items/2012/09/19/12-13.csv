4543300,comment,4534359,4537348,1,0,SolarNet,,,"So This may not be an FTL drive, but the way I always sort of pictured it is that the FTL moves you forward in time to the relative observer (so if you move distance x you move (c/x)^-1 forward in time). So if you send an FTL courier (assuming travel time of 2) from point A with times tA=102 tB=51 it would arrive at point B at times tA=52 tB=104 (A time 53 units in the future from tA), if it got sent back it would arrive at point A at tA=106 tB=53 (A time 53 units in the future from point B). The distance traveled would be c*53 distance (53 units of time for light to travel) in 2 units of time.<p>This also works for the mars/earth scenario (say they are 14 minutes apart). Traveling to the place that the light you see in 14 minutes will be coming from instantly would only ever be traveling forward in time. Forward time travel doesn't break causality(?)<p>This is always sort of how I envisioned wormholes work (and is indeed how they work on shows like star gate). You go in one end and come out the other, unless you can communicate through the wormhole it would take light (distance times c) years to tell people on the other end you succeeded.<p>But perhaps I'm missing something...",1348059573

4543296,comment,4540776,4541465,1,0,veesahni,,,"iOS neither has true background apps nor a true history. When clicking a link that opens Safari (for example), the originating app only knows its shutting down and in the future may be restarted. The only decision to be made is ""Save state or not?"" .. the double-click-on-home method to go back to the last app works pretty consistently if apps save state, primarily due to simplification of options.<p>It sounds like Android, on the other hand, has real background apps and a real history.

A spotlight, outside of the camera's view, cast the rose's shadow on the paper on the easel. Dressed in a dark suit, Bakardy appeared in the frame carrying a large knife in his right hand. He sliced it deep into the rose's shadow. And when he cut into its shadow, something impossible happened: The corresponding part of the rose fell off the stem and onto the table.

4543236,comment,4539668,4542505,3,0,mbell,,,"1) WELD CDI has no good testing story.  The only option that allows CDI to work is to use Arquillian which deploys and undeploys an entire WAR for every test class, it other words it takes hours to run integration tests.  Unit tests are livable using Mokito and its ability to mock injections.<p>2) JSF + WELD have holes between there specs.  CDI can manage JSF session and request scoped beans and you can use conversation scoped beans in JSF.  However they never got around to figuring out view scoped beans (which IMO is one of the most useful things in JSF).  As a result you have to use some third party to make them work together.  There are a number of other spec holes but I'll use this one as an example.<p>This means using SEAM 3 or CODI CDI extensions to fill the gaps.  I went with SEAM 3 as it theoretically had a good lineage given that a lot of what was done in SEAM 2 ended up being the EE6 spec.  What the SEAM 3 project did however, was to write a half assed version of all their extensions, then summarily announced they were all ditching the project to go work on Apache Deltaspike, which is basically the same extensions with a different name.  Currently the SEAM 3 extensions are in various states of broken depending on the extension and your use case, and of course Delta Spike isn't ready yet (still in Apache Incubator).  I've removed most of SEAM 3 from my app at this point, the remaining module is SEAM Faces which is unfortunately plugging the hole in JSF View Scope working with WELD.  Also unfortunate is that there is and has been a bug in SEAM Faces for months now that causes the data JSF stored in the session to be unserializable.  So I'm stuck with sticky sessions.<p>SEAM modules also fill in the hole with Hibernate's stupid session management, i.e. opening a transaction in the RENDER_RESPONSE phase so lazy loading works.<p>Several times now I've run into bugs, gone to research them and found they weren't fixed because people from the involved modules were arguing over the EE6 spec.<p>I could probably yap for awhile here but It may be easier to say this, I started my current product last April(2011), it started as a ""pure"" EE6 app.  I ran into so many EE6 bugs and just pure stupidity in places that I've been moving away from it ASAP.  I've replaced Hibernate with Ebean, ditched 90% of SEAM, setup an API with Jersey/Jackson and we're now pushing all front end stuff to Rails or Backbone apps which just talk to the API.<p>I'd never write another webapp with EE6.  Jetty/Jersey/Jackson is great for web services, especially with groovy.  If you need to handle the front end tasks, use play or grails.",1348058079

When you switch from a regular paragraph to a list, and then back to another regular paragraph, you usually <i>want</i> to interrupt the flow of text. You <i>want</i> the reader to know that what follows is a list, not just a continuation of the last paragraph. Similarly, when you put a quote in its own paragraph, it's usually because you <i>want</i> the reader to notice that what they're reading is a quote from somebody else. Or if it's a novel, you <i>want</i> the reader to know that one person is done speaking and another person has begun to talk.<p>Texts have structure, and typography should make the structure clear to the reader. Not indenting on the left side at all might make your blocks look prettier, but I would much rather have large margins around lists so that they stand out from the surrounding text. Large gaps and indentations are much more effective at conveying interruption than some symbols in the left margin.",1348057459

I know there are at least a few physicists who post on HN, and perhaps one of them could provide a more informed estimation than I.<p>Bear in mind, this article only addresses one of the many fundamental challenges to the Alcubierre drive: the energy requirements. Typically, the energy requirement has been considered the primary challenge to the feasibility of the device. But it's not the only one. Science hasn't completely worked out what would happen <i>inside</i> the bubble, or what happens to particles of matter interacting with the bubble at its leading edge. I've heard at least one speculation that the bubble would fill up with Hawking radiation and pretty much roast everyone alive inside it, like a big, interstellar dutch oven.<p>Another issue is the stability of the bubble itself. Again, the article doesn't really address this issue. But it's a pretty big one.",1348056484

I believe Intel has been working just as heavily to tweak the JS performance in the phones that shipped with their processor.<p>Also, Intel is being misleading about having a ""2 Ghz processor"". The thing is it will use that frequency when it's doing the benchmark, so you'll be like ""wow, great performance from this chip"", but then in 99% of the situations, you'll be using it at its ""real frequency"" of 1.6 Ghz (Anand says it's still 1.3 Ghz, Engadget may be in error there), so the real performance is probably much worse than the benchmakrs make it look.",1348056069

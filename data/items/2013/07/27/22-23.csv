You might be aware of negative gearing, too.<p>Just curious, were your parents an influence in how you view property? I imagine here that many 18-30s whose parents bought property would be more likely to buy for themselves.<p>Thinking about it, the only friends I can think of immediately who doesn&#x27;t own their own house here (out of say 20-30 people) are still studying or recently finished.

To the extent that there are problems in the world, it seems the wealthy feel almost universally as if their own resources and philosophies are best suited for remedying them, rather than governments or other collective structures or any contrasting philosophies. This precludes ever examining whether &quot;tax systems and global finance&quot; --or other attitudes and philosophies of the wealthy-- are the actual perpetrators of those problems. Peter Buffet argues that such philosophical transplantation is the cause of the problems the transplantation is trying to fix and that any sincere attempts to remedy society&#x27;s ills must address it.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think the wealthy, on the whole, are really concerned about fairness and justice in any context that parts them from their wealth.

The evidence seems to be that most (or at very least a non-trivial subset of) consumers don&#x27;t know, don&#x27;t care or even actively prefer the &quot;shitty&quot; experience. Thus one could even argue that Samsung, far from being unaware or lazy is actively choosing this as the most rational and logical path to profits. It may just be that the people such as yourself are in the 10% of the population who are a) particularly sensitive to this sort of thing and b) extremely used to the iPhone level of experience.<p>Now I myself also find the stock Samsung experience incredibly ugly and laggy. The interesting thing is that you can remedy it in about 30 seconds by dragging a few widgets off the screen, disabling a few useless services and/or putting an alternative launcher on. Thus most of the lagginess is only &quot;skin deep&quot; and not a fundamental property of their phones. I think internally Samsung actually does very good engineering and optimization of their phones. At some point the marketing department gets a hold of the phone and completely ruins it, but thankfully it is too far down the chain for them to do any fundamental damage to it.",1374965004

But... these sorts of micro-rankings of countries that all have similar &quot;operating systems&quot; are not very useful. The real lesson here is that OECD countries which by and large practice liberal democracy and free markets are tightly clustered on most quality of life measurements, while countries that don&#x27;t tend to cluster lower down. This is true of countries with vastly different cultural legacies, and even countries like Japan that has liberal demoracy successfully forced on them at gun point.<p>It makes you wonder just what Buffet thinks he&#x27;s talking about.

Windows &#x27;won&#x27; because it had the lions share of the apps. Platforms exist to run apps. What&#x27;s happening with phones isn&#x27;t directly comparable though because phones primarily exist for calls, messaging, browsing and apps. Apps are only one facet of their functionality, but its the one where Apple is still very dominant. If you stop looking at the smartphone market as a phone market, and focus just of the smartphone (browser and app) functional usage Apple is so dominant it&#x27;s not funny. It is still comfortably ahead in overall developer revenue, web usage share and premium app availability. So as a smartphone app platform, iOS is the Windows here. Even if Android overtakes iOS as an app platform, which is conceivable and may even be inevitable, the health of the iOS platform is strong enough it&#x27;s hard to see how it could become so marginalised as to threaten its viability for a very long time to come.

This is called a &quot;sub-threshold&quot; dose, and is also known as a &quot;microdose&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s still possible for the substance to have some subtle, interesting effects at these doses.  Things such as an increased creative ability, enhanced energy, and insight.  Some people take microdoses of psychedelics to improve their problem-solving abilities.  At these doses, your anxiety should be much lower than if you took a regular (nevermind a mindblowing) dose outright.<p>After a number of such microdose trips, it&#x27;s possible to slowly increase the dosage.  Hopefully, as you do this, you&#x27;ll become more familiar with the territory and know what to expect, and there will be less fear of the unknown and of the novel effects you will likely experience.<p>That said, there can be some negative effects -- particularly nausea.  Also, it&#x27;s dangerous to pick wild mushrooms, which can be poisonous if a mistake in identification is made.  There&#x27;s a saying in the mycology community: <i>There are old mushroom hunters, and there are bold mushroom hunters.  But there are no old, bold mushroom hunters.</i><p>Ideally, you&#x27;d only partake of mushrooms under the guidance of an experienced mycologist (and after having done a lot of research yourself about proper mushroom identification).<p>Unfortunately, an experienced mycologist is not always available, and the mushrooms available on the black market are often dried, crumbled, and in a state that&#x27;s virtually impossible to identify anyway.  The potency and even the active ingredient in such samples is very questionable.  They could easily be laced with LSD or some other drug and you may be none the wiser.<p>Some people advocate only ever taking synthetic compounds like LSD, which are at least less likely to be counterfeit when taken as blotter or microdots (because they are so small that no other drug would be potent enough to do anything at that dosage).  However, some newer designer drugs are almost as potent as LSD, and are potentially more toxic.  So it&#x27;s not clear what should be recommended, if one is concerned about side-effects, identity of the compound, or toxicity.  Perhaps growing or synthesizing one&#x27;s own would then be the safest route.  But, of course, depending on the laws in your jurisdiction and depending on your skills, these options may come with their own risks.",1374964161

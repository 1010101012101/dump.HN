You may even display an alert to the user when he logs in, asking to confirm if they hold rights over that file (yes/no). If they click on No, you delete that link too. If they click yes, well... you are not a cop, so you are not obliged to investigate if the user is telling the truth. Anyway, being in a private folder, the copyright owner will never know the file is there.

3488843,comment,3488454,3488800,7,0,lusr,,,"My current favourite is to describe it like this:  You have to build a puzzle. Problem is nobody really knows what the puzzle should look like. Instead you get a few hundred pages of documentation written by a bunch of people who don't really know much more about the puzzle than you do describing how they think PARTS of the puzzle should look like in the end - based on discussions they've had with people who have no idea about the big picture either. Oh, you don't actually get any puzzle pieces - that's up to you to create.<p>As you start trying to build something that looks like the puzzle, you realise that instead of the 1,000 pieces originally estimated for the puzzle, you're going to need 5,000, and the puzzle is actually in 3 dimensions not just 2, and also the puzzle needs to fit with another puzzle built by a different team of people who had no idea your puzzle needs to fit with them. Then you find out your puzzle pieces, that you borrowed from someone else, don't work as expected with put together with certain other pieces... :)",1327049695

3488813,comment,3485933,3487424,1,0,aswell,,,"The idea that you would make intentionally make misleading suggestions certainly would explain a lot. I was actually expecting that to some degree. I think what confounded me so much is just how ridiculous the statements were and how many there were.<p>At one point I was reduced to essentially defending the very idea of startups and technology innovation. In the stress of the moment I also assumed like the comments were made sincerely (call me naive) so I did my best to pick my jaw up off the floor and explain why they were wrong -- only to be cutoff half way into a sentence. Rinse. Repeat.<p>When I say I'm ""comfortable debating"" I don't mean that I need to be comfortable <i>while</i> debating. I grew up with lawyers in my family and in a household where heated debate was part of our every day life. I've worked with some extremely smart and opinionated people. I love a vigorous debate about topics I'm passionate about (like startups). No one who knows me would say I'm a pushover, and most would agree I'm very open to sound logic and evidence.<p>I think if there's one thing that felt very different in my YC experience it was the intentionally misleading statements. I really am not accustomed to arguing with people who repeatdly make disengenous statements just to judge how I'll react. It's one thing to take an arbitrary position and defend it, it's another to just throw out random misleading statements. To me that would seem to only muddy the waters.<p>I'm sure I could learn to play that game. Maybe the best founders are great their first run. For all I know I was judged okay on that front. I don't really know.<p>I do know though that one would learn a lot more about my ability to think by restricitng the conversation to an honest debate of the relevant issues.<p>Again. I respect all of you guys and know you're good people and ridiculously smart. I'm not making any judgements on that account. One of the reasons I find YC so amazing is that you don't have to be ""someone"" to get in. It's not an old boy's club.

In both cases though, we should hope that the majority is well-informed enough to make a decision.

3488765,comment,3485933,3485933,1,0,jorleif,,,"This was a very insightful post which confirms my experience that generally working with people you can't communicate easily with almost always leads to bad results.  What I'm wondering though, is if it really is a property of the person, or the fit between the two parties. Some people just don't get each other. Maybe their values are too far apart or something. Maybe they try to follow the other parties implications, but it leads somewhere they don't want to go, or then they cannot even fill in the blanks correctly because of different mental models.<p>So an alternative explanation for pg's observation is that when there is founder-advisor fit, communication is easy, because both parties can follow the implications of the other party and value similar things. Then the startups with better founder-advisor fit do better in the outside world, because they can actually benefit from the advice they are getting, whereas for the ones without founder-advisor fit the advice is pure noise to them, and does not guide them in the right direction (that is the one they want to go).",1327046601

After implementing bytebuffer-based slab allocation, this is only several seconds, and once every three days. Service runs on 200 nodes, with redundancies. Kicking the process on <i>one</i> of them, in a slow roll that finishes in under 3 days, works around the unresponsiveness window (planned shutdown easier to manage than an unpredictable pause).<p>It's <i>totally</i> a workaround and not a solution. Atilla follows up this example with an anecdote of talking to Oracle folks about when are they going to have true pauseless GC, and they responded with ""not that big an issue, really, everyone finds a workaround..."" So, this is an example of a workaround. A pretty good one once you realize it's not ""the one"" machine, it's ""some one"" machine out of 200.",1327046475

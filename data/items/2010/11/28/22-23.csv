But they actually do do lots of good stuff.<p>The US, like any state, does what it needs to to protect its interests. For example, the US fights against corruption in some foreign countries. The reason they do this is because corruption makes it harder for US corporations to penetrate the corrupt state's market. The US is fine with corruption when it benefits them.<p>The US state's work for disarmament is similar. They wish to maintain the advantage of their own nuclear arsenal, so they work to prevent those not on their team from acquiring nuclear weapons. It's self interest.<p>A state is like a business. With guns. And each state has a brand that it promotes.<p>>You can be a critic of the U.S. government and think Wikileaks is being reckless here.<p>The real recklessness in this case is the laughably poor opsec of the US.

In May 2009, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson reported that Pakistan was refusing to schedule a visit by American technical experts because, as a Pakistani official said, “if the local media got word of the fuel removal, ‘they certainly would portray it as the United States taking Pakistan’s nuclear weapons,’ he argued.”",1290984744

You used it the typical Commodore way: open a channel to the device, print command codes to the channel.

One funny thing was that, if you forgot the semi-colon at the end of the PRINT# command, you got an ""nnnn"" noise at the end of every statement.  Why?  Because all ASCII characters had associated sounds with the synthesiser, and the end of line character, which the semi-colon suppresses in a print statement, was mapped to the sound of the letter N.<p>Decades later, totally different technology, and you brought up that memory.

If our supposedly democratic government has decided that secrecy will be standard operating procedure for law enforcement, that government still has the main job of protecting it's secret operatives. Wikileaks isn't a spy agency, they just take information that's there. Any good intelligence operation compartmentalizes information on a need-to-know basis. So if names of some operator are flying around, someone has screwed up long before Wikileaks appears on the scene. The good way of protecting the classified information is keeping it within an intelligence agency. Should free-speech be hobbled for those situations where the secret-keepers screw-up?<p>Further, it doesn't seem coincidental to me that the main justification for government secrecy is stopping victimless crimes and intervening in foreign conflicts.

But 99% of Ruby code I read has been written by people who know when they need parentheses/brackets to make the code readable (e.g. when it's not the only code on the line.) But there are tons of times when it's wonderful to be able to leave out the parentheses.<p><pre><code>    -\n</code></pre>\n2) It might be because I spend a lot of time with Ruby, but I much prefer `end`s to curly brackets, they're just easier on the eyes, especially when they're going to take up the entire line anyway:<p><pre><code>    a\n      b\n        c\n          d\n          end\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\n\n    a {\n      b {\n        c {\n          d {\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOf course, at times I wish Ruby used indentation to declare structure, like Python.<p><pre><code>    -\n</code></pre>\n3) I don't think I've ever had that problem. If I'm calling `person.full_name`, I don't care if that's a variable, or a method joining first_name and last_name. And if I it was a method, ideally I'd have a corresponding `full_name=(str)` method defined too, so `person.full_name = ""Joe Bloggs""` would work, and split the string into the first, last, and optional middle names.<p><pre><code>    -\n</code></pre>\n4) Why?

In the case of regexp matching, these partial parse states are functions mapping one state of the regexp matching automaton to another. You need one more thing: the ability to append two of these partial parse states, combining them into one. In the regexp example, this is just function composition. The key here is that this operation must be associative, and there must be an identity element: some partial parse state such that combining it with another state doesn't change anything. And its result must also be a partial parse state. This combination of parse states and an associative binary operation is called a monoid.<p>Once you have these conditions fulfilled, you can do all sorts of fun stuff. For instance, you can represent a string as a tree of chunks, and cache partial parse states at the nodes in the tree. That way, when you change the string, you can recompute the changed parse states in something like O(lg n) time, rather than going through and re-parsing the entire string. Or you can almost trivially parallelize your parser.<p>A week ago, I did exactly this: I had a language that needed parsing, and I wanted to incrementally reparse when I changed the (potentially very long) string, so I used a finger tree and wrote an incremental parser. It works beautifully.",1290982809

I don't see how this is going to benefit anyone involved.<p>The people who chased the IT promise of huge salaries in the last decade or two are already jaded because those salaries came with an an expectation that they deliver as much value as the superstars. Given the oft repeated statistics and horror stories and such, I'd suspect most of them struggled to generate even as much value as their employer paid them, let alone actually be profitable to employ.[1] So they entrenched as best they could, and tried to make themselves valuable by hoarding knowledge and trading political capital. This worked until the knowledge they hoarded became irrelevant, because better, easier technology became directly accessible to the people the IT department supported. The technology certainly didn't require no support, but it required much less, and the best people in IT had already learned about it because they actually like their profession and spend their own time being curious.<p>Ironically, I've noticed a tendency for people in IT to be really staunch neo-luddites; the same forces that made them valuable are now making them irrelevant, and they were too narrow-focussed on their own walled garden of knowledge to notice that the process never stopped. So, now they are waving at barn-doors. I'm sure they'd have shrugged their arms at elevator operators when those became fully automated.<p>So, what now if they flood into the world of software development? I suspect one of two things will end up happening. Either they'll be met with a wall of high expectations that won't even let them in, or they'll go through another cycle of entrenchment followed by irrelevance, with the same knee-jerk reaction of trying to blame technology for continuing to advance. It will probably be a blend, where some places will set high expectations and refuse to let anything but the really good people in, and the rest will suffer from entrenchment of the workforce.<p>So here's my tl;dr point: it's not about the IT vs. developer delineation. It never has been. In fact, a lot of the people who start these ISVs and write these small modular apps have to play <i>both</i> roles at once. It is about the passionate and capable people vs. the one's who chase rainbows and try to ride along long enough to get some sort of windfall. The latter has never been a sound personal economic strategy; the only difference now is that technology iterates rapidly enough that the not-so-really-good get found out a lot sooner. If anything, I think <i>that</i> will be the next decade.<p>[1] Either that, or all of the statistics and stories are crap, but I would believe that more if they weren't repeated by people who have had decades in the industry.",1290981918

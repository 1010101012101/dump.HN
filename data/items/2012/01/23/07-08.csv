3499483,comment,3498202,3498621,1,0,mbell,,,">We need a simple and cheap distribution channel. In 20 years there will be no movie theaters. They might remain as a novelty, but 90% of them will be gone.<p>I don't completely agree with this part.  I do think the number of theaters will decrease but I don't think they will become simply novelty items (in the way that drive in theaters are).<p>There are several selling points to theaters only one of which is ""new releases"".  The other primary selling point is the experience, which breaks down into two sub points.<p>One is ""you can't get this at home"".  This covers things like IMAX, even a 50"" 3D TV doesn't even come close and with any foreseeable technology it just isn't going to happen in the home outside those few who build $x0,000 setups with a dedicated room.<p>The other part of the experience is the social aspect, which covers the growing trend for theaters to be less the ""500 seats"" style and more the tables serving beer and real food style.<p>So I think theaters will continue to be popular.  The ratty ""cram 500 people into a room for a new release"" variety will die out.  IMAX style theaters and those that provide a more ""dinner and movie with friends around a table"" style will grow.<p>I think if you look at the industry statistics, this is already happening.  I know at least around here (Northeast USA) numerous old style theaters have either closed or converted to the ""dinner and movie"" style and IMAX theaters seems to be popping up everywhere.",1327304273

In most cases, a business has a desire to fill a position fairly quickly, and especially in start-ups and small businesses, cost is a major concern.  In larger businesses or governmental organizations, HR regulations and bureaucracy become a major factor.<p>I've personally filtered out dozens if not hundreds of otherwise qualified people due to salary concerns without a second thought.  In two cases within the last six months I've seen the party who pushed for a higher salary reach out again only to find the position filled.<p>My guess is that you've never experienced an employer's market.

3499467,comment,3497470,3497470,1,0,fxm4139,,,"I think part of the issue with talking like we do in our living room, or with our friends, is that articles like this focus purely on the execution of the presentation, and not enough on prepping the content and setting up a theme.  The basic purpose of a presentation is to convey something to an audience.  How many of us actually sit and think about the audience, and why they need to give you a few minutes of their time, before churning out slides?  I believe that many presentations fail at a fundamental level because the content and sequence of presentation is not thought out well enough.<p>I think back to all the terrible presentations I did when I was in college, or when I presented at several academics conferences.  People typically jump in front of PowerPoint/Keynote when it comes time to preparing for the presentation.  By now you are already doomed, because you have given absolutely no thought to a theme, a story or a takeaway.  After you set up a sequence of slides that's likely to be  incoherent on first try, techniques like stopping your 'Ums' or practicing in front of a mirror can only get you so far.  These are minituae that may help make you a good speaker, but won't fix the underlying issue that you haven't given enough thought about the content, theme or storyline.  You have barely given a thought to your audience and why they care about your talk.<p>I recently became a Product Manger at a startup (was a developer for 5 years prior to that).  Presenting, communicating and convincing is a big part of my job now and I've been iterating every week on getting better.  Here is my take and what I've found to work for me.  There are two parts to this:<p>- Content, Theme or Story:  Please don't go to slides or bullets when you start preparations.  In fact, stay away from slides till you have completely visualized what an ideal version of your talk should sound like.  In other words, if you were to explain your startup, a weekend project or a cooking recipe to a handful of people in your living room, how would you go about doing it? What sequence of explanation makes most sense? What do you want the audience to take away.  Think about this hard.  Replay it over and over in your head.  Talk to your peers and A/B test it over lunch/coffee.  You'll figure out the basic structure of the talk soon enough.  Getting to a slide set becomes a piece of cake after this.  And you'll notice that when you go up in front of people that slides truly end up becoming an auxiliary to your presentation, instead of the primary focus point.  I've seen a major difference in the quality of my presentation purely by the amount of work I put in refining the theme of the presentation.  It gives you focus on what to talk about, and gives clarity to your audience as they listen to you.<p>- Delivery: This can be solved and made better with practice.  This could get involve figuring out a routine, stopping your 'Ums' or practicing 150 times in front of the mirror.  I have a much better and effective solution that will get teach you how to control nervousness, stop your 'Ums', and just generally train you into being confident while going up on stage (wow that last sentence sounds like a scam :)).  No seriously though, take an Improv Class.  They typically cost $200 for 8 sessions and is no where as intimidating as it sounds (take this from someone who used to be a very shy person).  I guarantee that a few improv sessions teach you the fundamentals of conveying a non realistic scene to your audience will blow 150 practice sessions in front of the mirror.",1327303838

Two years ago I started a streaming music company knowing pretty much nothing about licensing laws.  Now, after working with one of the best music licensing attorneys available and reading an annoying amount on this subject, it is clear that if you intentionally set out to create an industry that was impossible to maneuver legally, you could not do as good a job as the current music industry.  And, I know it's the same for the film industry, which is further complicated by the fact that nearly all films also have music in them.<p>Both of these industries are filled with extensive legal requirements, many of them labor laws, union regulations, licensing restrictions and more, designed to make sure that artists and other people are not exploited.  For every movie you make, not only do certain players in the movie have certain rights, certain royalties owed, and so forth, but then there is music in it.  That music has a copyright owner, a publisher, and so on.  They all have different rights, and many have assigned those rights to others for management, and this information is not easily located all of the time.<p>There is no cookie cutter way to license everything you need for these films in one stroke of a pen world wide.  In some countries, even the publishing rights owners themselves cannot waive or change the mandatory rates to be paid for the use of their work.  And, as a company putting out a world wide film, you have to know all of these laws for all of these countries.  And then to do what you've proposed you have to make the movie available in every weird new format that comes out every other week, you have to forego release schedules that actually allow you to build buzz and execute a marketing plan that maximizes the ROI for your investment, and so forth.<p>So, there are about a million reasons why what you described is impossible.  And then, at the end there is that one last incentive to pirate that will never be gotten rid of - charging money, which they cannot avoid.<p>All things being equal, you don't think these people want to make their product more convenient to have?  I know a ton of people in the industry who try to put their content anywhere they possible can.  At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how hard they try, it's never going to compete with free, and these people deserve to be paid for their work.",1327302982

It still takes extremely hard work, undying dedication to users, timing, etc... YC is only one cog in the wheel, and plenty of startups actually succeed without them -- which might seem disillusioning to some, especially those that hang around these boards too often.<p>I believe that's what he's getting at, anyhow.",1175835056

There is also a great big chasm between ""still in existence"" and success. If you sell-off assets for the benefit of creditors your company can still exist but it would be hard to call that a success.<p>The numbers I hear from my VC friends is that around 50% are out of business after the 2nd year. They see more of teh picture than I do so I trust they are better qualified to make teh call.<p>My opinion is that more companies fail because of incompetence than insufficient funding. If you really have a great idea you can make it work. The trouble is that most make some big mistake and spoil the well. <p>I think starting a company is one of the most exhilarating things you can do. I wish more people would try it. I also wish more of them would try to understand the basics of business operations. This is where I disagree with Paul. I have seen too many $100 million ideas ruined by founders mistakes. Too often the time has past before they can regain their opportunity.<p>I still encourage everyone to give it their best shot. It's a great ride, up or down.",1175833826

P, including the errors in P. Since the errors are spread out, with high probability, you'll catch an error choosing a very small number of bits of Q.<p>It's like MAGIC... Especially since they don't explain it at all in the article.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCP_theorem"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCP_theorem</a>",1175833357

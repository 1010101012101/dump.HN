In the 3rd edition of Topgrading I offer definitions of A, B, C across many competencies, but early in the book I say that the simplest way to think of A, B, C Players is high performer, adequate, low performer.  I&#x27;ve asked 6,500 executives (in Topgrading Interviews) to characterize the teams they inherited and ended up with and  they easily relate to high perfumer, adequate, low performer ... and the long explanation of &quot;top 10%% can be avoided.  These 3 categories work for executives or part time stockers.  That said, over time companies get better and better &quot;calibrated&quot; and the requirements become stiffer;  therefore, in 2014 clients think back to their designations 3 years ago and now put a higher percentage in the lower categories ... because is does take time/experience to accurately rate someone.

Like most such studies, the conclusion is that people are happy because they&#x27;re in relationships -- or is it that people are in relationships because they&#x27;re happy? Or is it that an unexamined variable, such as one or more genetic traits, produces a person who is both happy and in a relationship?<p>Psychology can&#x27;t tell us.

What if there was a site where in order to sign-up you were required to setup direct deposit to special investing account? The investing account would, in turn, take a percentage of your salary, and invest it in age-appropriate index funds. The remainder would be re-deposited into a person’s local checking account. That way, it would feel like you only had the net amount that ends up in your checking account, and the invested amount would be removed before you had a chance to contemplate spending it.<p>A setup like this is something that someone could easily do for themselves using a discount broker, but a site that would more or less make it a one-time decision could be really helpful, because it would remove much of anxiety and education that a person typically has to go through to get this right.",1410626537

We are providing companies with easy-to-use solutions based on the basic systems they understand. Half our companies come from competitor&#x27;s tools while the other half are just getting started with a tech solution for their general workflow. Our hypothesis is that majority of workers wear multiple hats and spend more time figuring out what to do by assessing their responsibilities across multiple tools. We give these workers and their teams one place to address their system. This gives everyone on the team a clear idea of what actually needs to be done with full context.<p>Our favorite use case is a medical office that has made the jump to EMR. Much of their data is digitized but there is little benefit directly to them. However, once that digital data becomes a part of their workflow they actually see the benefit in it.<p>We are trying to think more generally about each of these problems and providing guidance to our individual customers specific to their vertical. Although it may seem we are still finding product-market fit, the small business market is always fragmented and diverse so this is just the reality of the situation.",1410624450

8312725,comment,8312372,8312372,7,0,ColinDabritz,,,"I love it, I&#x27;ve been considering how to livestream real coding best for quite a while, in terms of personal streaming. Having a dedicated site is great.<p>I&#x27;m seeing some skepticism over all for a variety of reasons, certainly valid concerns, but I think they largely frame it in terms of traditional &quot;attention grabbing&quot; streaming, like game play. The other day Notch was streaming his doom-on-the-web experimenting, which was really fascinating to watch. Imagine if Bret Victor was live streaming his playful explorations of coding and visualization, discussing his thinking as he progressed. To me, those are killer apps.<p>I think programming streaming is essentially different from, for example, video game streaming.<p>It has many specific qualities that make it an interesting platform. Education, a window into true software development, and the highest integrity source control possible.<p>It&#x27;s definitely true that the &#x27;pace&#x27; is different, especially if it isn&#x27;t &quot;showcase&quot; programming. I think the strengths lie in a couple key areas.<p>It&#x27;s extremely honestly educational. In the programming industry you see a lot of canned talks, which are great for introducing new things, showing specific techniques, they have lots of uses. On the down side though, they are very misleading to learners. The work programmers do is not largely blazing away along the perfect path of a problem, whipping out code as fast you can type (or copy paste). It messy, complicate, has lots of fumbling and dead ends, and it&#x27;s more about thinking hard than typing fast (not that fast typing is bad, it&#x27;s handy to get your ideas out of your head quickly, it&#x27;s just not job #1).<p>It&#x27;s &quot;boring&quot; in a switch off your brain, entertain me at all times sense. If you literally streamed hidden spy cams of most programming, you would get very little interaction. I think it&#x27;s intellectually very interesting in an engaging way, to watch others wrestle with problems, to see how they do things differently, and gain insights into a very intimate process.<p>I livestreamed a bit of turn based gaming on the release of a game, and it was remarkable. Most streamers day one were tearing through the game at a relatively fast pace. I was taking it slow. Some people complained about the speed, but my goal was to &quot;full plan&quot; working the thoughts and strategy options through, and talking through it end to end. Some people were frustrated by that, looking for more of the other styles of streaming, but I gained a small audience (averaging 20s, peaking at 80s, it felt decent for a new streamer). I talked out my thought process, which helped improve it. My brain was &#x27;fully switched on&#x27; in a state of flow. Just these things helped my play immensely. I also interacted with my audience, which helped that much more. A live stream can be your pair programmer. You can explore new ideas and possibilities.<p>I imagine it more like when an SC2 player is exploring a build. It&#x27;s &quot;dull and boring&quot; because it&#x27;s relatively predictable, but as they explain their thoughts and discover new timings and possibilities, it catches a lot of peoples interest.<p>Another important aspect for me is the timeline. Maybe not every minute is interesting, but perhaps with a highlights feature you could step through a process and show example. &quot;See, this is where I made the architectural goof. You can see hints here and here showing that it&#x27;s problematic. Here&#x27;s where the realization happened and why, and here is the much more satisfying fix&quot;.<p>What if you had a recording of every moment of the programming of a non-trivial system? You could do great research. You could study the kind of mistakes people make, do minute-by-minute root cause analysis. My only concern here is that narrating what you are doing, and having a live audience may alter the style of your work. Can you still complete your best work under these circumstances? It&#x27;s an interesting question, and I&#x27;ve love to explore the answer. I think it&#x27;s definitely a different approach from the solo quiet solitary work style, but if my experience with streaming gaming was an indication it&#x27;s one you can leverage into high engagement and flow. The question is can you do all of the great work you need to in front of an audience?<p>To me, with a timeline, livestreaming and archiving is the ultimate in source control. What if you could trace a line of code to a check in to a time stamp to the video of that line of code being created? What if you could stitch that all together to a work item or ticket, and get video of the design and thinking process, to understanding why the code is a certain way? That&#x27;s exciting.<p>One of my biggest concerns is the licensing policy. I need to own my code. I need to own my ideas. Maybe it&#x27;s open source software. But as a streaming site, you are getting a non-exclusive, revocable right to host my livestreams. In return you can play ads and host my archives.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this quite a bit. I want to be a part of this. I&#x27;ve submitted my email on the website. I believe you can also email me here.<p>Thank you for embarking on this adventure.",1410624154

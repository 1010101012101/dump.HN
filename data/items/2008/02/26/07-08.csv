It has Tk, Expect, Interp, Tkcon, wiki.tcl.tk that you will miss when you have to go back to programming in Arc.You'll be so frustrated with Arc that you'll have to quit your job to work full-time on Tcl -- which is coincidentally what I plan to do.<p>Wow, It works!",1204012687

123744,story,,,1,4,iamyoohoo,"Ask YC: Cloud-Outsourcing, Cloud-Offshoring - what do you think?",,"We all need help from time to time. We may not have the resources to do everything all the time and a little help goes a long way, whether it be to program something or test something - small project or large.<p>Not just for startups, but for small businesses or even for mid size businesses that are short on IT resources but do not want to hire full time or even hire a contractor for a month.<p>The problem with sites like ELance, Rentacoder and even ODesk etc. is that you have to add a bid, wait for people to respond, take a guess at which one would be able to do a good job, and hope that the work will happen. Most people that have used it will say they have had bad experiences at some time or another - quite often many times.<p>So here's the concept that I am hoping to implement. Let's call it ""cloud-outsourcing"" or ""cloud-offshoring"". A similar concept to cloud-computing (amazon ec2, s3 etc.), the concept is to outsource to a cloud - whether the  job is small or large (2 hours, 2 days or 20 months), you can outsource/offshore the work to the cloud and only pay for the work done finally.  You don't pay if nothing's used, and you only pay when it's done.<p>-- will you use it for that 10 hour thing you want done\n-- will you use it for that 10 day thing you want done\n-- cloud-computing is based on processing/bandwidth/storage etc. which are consistent parameters, how would you price this service ?<p>The reason I'm bringing this up is that I specialize in outsourced/offshore development, have a fully offshore team which is very reliable but I always feel people have a hard time finding other developers to go to when they need it and they may not always need a contractor for 6 months and may not need a person all day, they may need someone 2 hours a day for a month and there is no reliable and easy way of getting that kind of help.<p>Thoughts ? How would you want to use such a service if you had the need ? What tools would this need, what would make you comfortable trusting something like this (if it was not amazon that created ec2, i'm sure the startup would have a hard time getting adoption, hence the question)<p>Thank you.",1204011916

123741,comment,123353,123353,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"As someone who develops mobile apps for a living targeted at industrial markets, I would amend that headline to read:<p>""Mobile Consumer Applications, RIP"".  I'm sure the authors comments are spot-on in the general consumer market (which seems to be his area of expertise), but the custom, industrial mobile app market is alive and well.  Admittedly, most of the companies involved are large beasts and move slowly, so I'm still developing for Embedded DOS and older Windows CE versions, but the market is quite healthy.",1204011014

I think they probably would be able to crack the 10%. If they couldn't then it would be a fair indication that the data is simply too noisy to beat the 10%.",1204010047
123735,comment,123693,123693,0,0,rtf,,,"First of, I second the others. By the time I got around to seriously learning programming and specifically game programming I was using Python/Pygame on a 1 gigahertz machine and it gave me about as much power as a 486 would running optimized C code. (more in some instances, less in others) If you're after concepts and not retro-technical details this is a good route to go.<p>But as for the questions:<p>1. Threading is not the answer; it was a missing concept on DOS machines. Interrupt polling is what you want to look at.\n2. I recall reading about this but never did it myself. These days you're lucky if both the monitor and graphics card support mode 13h.\n3. The term you want is ""fast rectangle blit"". This is still relevant if you use software rendering.",1204009981

I've never really understood why LSD gets a bad rap -- you have to try really, really hard to fuck yourself up while tripping, or have terrible judgment.<p>Then again, as Ken Kesey put it -- ""we thought we were writing the history and future of the universe, but what we really said was 'if you pick your nose long enough, the world will unravel'.""  Drugs, strange experiences, etc. may unlock insights but they don't seem to help the unprepared mind very much.",1204009724
123731,comment,123693,123693,0,0,xirium,,,"Firstly, skip all of the low-level, platform-specific details and learn JavaScript. This will give you all of the colours and performance that you require for sprite based games. I've seen a very good version of OutRun done in JavaScript. A 2D platformer can definitely be implemented. Also, if you implement in JavaScript then you'll also get a wide audience for your work without requiring anyone to install anything.<p>Secondly, a real-time game is a turn-based game where the turns occur in real-time. Unlike a strategy game, the computer continues even if you don't make a move. Imagine AD&D melee combat at 30 rounds per second. This doesn't require threading.",1204009577

I thought it was outrageously overpriced -- now I'm wondering if it isn't a halfway decent deal for the interface and capabilities of the thing.<p>I continue to carry the cheapest Motorola piece of shit that will accept my SIM card, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't envy the iPhone.",1204009481

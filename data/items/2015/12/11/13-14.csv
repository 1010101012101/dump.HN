These people (managers, HR) are hired by the capitalists to optimize internally for profit. The only warm & fuzzy side-effects that these positions provide are the ones that don&#x27;t get in the way of capital increasing.<p>It&#x27;s not even about these individuals being evil or not. I&#x27;m sure most of them are torn to pieces (before they become numb) when they make decisions against the wellbeing of the workforce. The point is that the managers would not be in these positions if they could not fulfill these roles — they would be replaced. These positions self-select for &quot;evil.&quot;<p>The people who optimize <i>externally</i> for profit focus not on squeezing the workforce, they focus on squeezing the public. These are the lawyers, the salespeople, the accountants, the marketers, the compliance experts. There&#x27;s no point debating the evilness of the individuals, but their roles are necessarily evil. These roles tend to grow more and more evil as the capitalist enterprise grows. The enemy here, then, is capital, not these poor workers who fill necessary capitalist roles.",1449842310

It hasn&#x27;t prevented any breaches? How do you know? It doesn&#x27;t validate cards you enter into Apple Pay? If you possess the card (or can make one from having possession of the card data) then you can already use it fraudulently, loading it into an iPhone is just an extra unnecessary step for the thief. The security advantage is that malicious terminals can&#x27;t steal card data, and stealing your method of payment doesn&#x27;t confer the ability to pay.

10717092,comment,10712854,10712854,0,0,panglott,,,"&quot;In the 1990s it became clear that microfinance, then the most exciting tool in development economics, was not reaching the very poorest people... BRAC came up with a scheme to help the ultra-poor. It gives them a small stipend for food, followed by an asset such as a cow or a few goats, which they are expected to manage. Field workers visit weekly for the next two years, teaching recipients, for example, how to tell when a cow is in heat and how to get it inseminated. The aim is to help women &#x27;graduate&#x27; from extreme poverty to the normal kind—as Sir Fazle puts it, &#x27;to help them back into the mainstream of poor people&#x27;. ...A study published earlier this year in <i>Science</i> showed that similar programmes run by other NGOs boosted consumption in Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Pakistan and Peru, with the effects lasting at least a year after they ended. ...Such programmes are pricey. In India and Bangladesh they cost more than $1,000 per household at purchasing power parity. Other research explains why. ...The poorest women, it turned out, did far more hours of income-generating work...Yet they packed them into fewer days... The reason is that they toil mostly as domestic servants and in the fields—and casual agricultural work is seasonal. During planting and harvest they work extremely hard; the rest of the year they do little. Better-off women usually rear livestock, which is not only steady work but pays about twice as much per hour. When the poorest women are given cows, they quickly fill their idle time...&quot;",1449842216

So even if security researchers want to look at the code or build their own clients, it&#x27;s not possible. Reverse engineering is possible, but is tedious compared to having the source code. At least the Telegram client code is open source to support examining it.<p>That said, the criticism of Telegram for using home brewed encryption is appropriate and needs to be mentioned often (hopefully Telegram will change the protocol). Even the authors of this paper state:<p>> The take-home message (once again) is that well-studied, provably secure encryption schemes that achieve strong definitions of security (e.g., authenticated-encryption) are to be preferred to home-brewed encryption schemes.",1449841000

10716916,comment,10700766,10715540,0,0,humanrebar,,,"1. Slavery<p>First, I want to emphasize that freedom is a <i>very</i> strong theme in the Bible (a) (b). It&#x27;s frankly not true that the Bible condones slavery. When certain portions of the Bible describe slavery, it was more of a form of indentured servitude than the abomination we tend to think of. For various reasons, people would put <i>themselves</i> into lifelong work contracts. The Mosaic Law has very progressive laws (at the time) for how masters were to treat their servants.<p>In fact, the Mosaic Law specifically condemns forced slavery, under the penalty of death (c).<p>The Bible <i>does</i> encourage the forgiveness of debts (d), and in this context, masters releasing their indentured servants from their contracts was considered a part of this. The entire book of Philemon was basically about this.<p>Anyway, the American abolitionist movement absolutely had Christian underpinnings, as did the British equivalent (read up on Wilberforce). At a minimum, there are many modern and historical black ministers, like Theodore S. Wright and Dr. King, that would disagree with the idea that Bible says slavery is OK. That sort of thing clearly violates both the golden rule and the idea of <i>imago dei</i>.<p>Finally, black-market slavery is <i>still</i> a concern, especially sexual slavery. I don&#x27;t see much in the press about this sort of thing, but I haven&#x27;t been to a church in the last ten years that didn&#x27;t make fighting it a special focus in its ministry (e).<p>2. Causing harm with the intention of doing good.<p>I absolutely think Christians do this. When this happens, they need to listen and be humble enough to ask for forgiveness and change their ways. The greatest two commandments are to love God completely and to love others as we love ourselves (f). If we&#x27;re not willing to stop harming and start helping people, we&#x27;re breaking the second most important commandment directly and the first most important commandment through disobedience.<p>You probably see people (in shallow understanding of scripture, IMO) justify themselves with Bible verses when people are hurt. This is <i>not</i> Biblical. In fact, the harshest things Jesus said were to religious hyprocrites (g). Jesus has been, and still is, extremely counter-cultural. And religion, in the Bible, is all about charity and doing the right thing (h).<p>Anyway, I see many, many more Christians deciding to sacrifice their time, money, and energy to help people than I see harm. It&#x27;s hard to put to fine a point on the hypothetical premise, though.<p>3. ...if your religion keeps you from having real social contacts, I would urge you to change that, it&#x27;s probably not good for you in the long run.<p>Yes. I agree. The Bible is fundamentally about relationships, so a Christian faith with no relationships is incomplete at best.<p>I actually have much better friendships and my relationships with my family are also better now that I take the teaching in the Bible seriously. With salvation and assurance of a meaningful future, I don&#x27;t have to worry about myself (i) (j), so I can focus on others&#x27; needs, whether they&#x27;re physical, emotional, spiritual, or relational.<p>I have <i>never</i> seen someone with worse relationships because of their obedience in the Bible. I <i>have</i> seen people oppressed, mocked, and attacked for their faith and insistence on doing what is right. That&#x27;s what I was talking about. Sorry if that was not clear.<p>4. ...unlike real people, god does not actually exist, and you cannot expect anything tangible from god if you need help.... Other people will largely honor your loyalty with their support for you, god won&#x27;t.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t shock you that the Bible teaches the opposite.<p>And it probably won&#x27;t impress you that I&#x27;ve found the opposite to be true. God has never let me down, but people let me down all the time. I don&#x27;t hold that against them, though, since they&#x27;re my brothers and sisters and they&#x27;re not doing anything I haven&#x27;t done before in some way. But God is always there. Often not in the way I want or expect, but God isn&#x27;t a wingman or a genie that He&#x27;s obligated to follow my mission and fulfill my wishes.<p>I <i>will</i> say that <i>you</i> are very assured that God doesn&#x27;t exist, and logically you shouldn&#x27;t be. There is no way to prove that the God of the Bible does not exist. There is no scientific experiment you could whip up to use matter to prove the immaterial isn&#x27;t there. I&#x27;ve wrestled with atheism or perhaps deism before, and I&#x27;ve found that it takes a lot of... well, faith... to assume a negative.<p>(a) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A1</a>\n(b) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A23-29&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A2...</a>\n(c) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21:16"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21:16</a>\n(d) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A21-35&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A21...</a>\n(e) <a href=""http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/christians-human-trafficking-humanitarian-organizations/2015/10/27/id/634700/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/christians-human-traffic...</a>\n(f) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022:36-40"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022:36...</a>\n(g) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23</a>\n(h) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A27&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A27&ve...</a>\n(i) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-34"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-...</a>\n(j) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+1%3A11-13&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+1%3...</a>",1449840452

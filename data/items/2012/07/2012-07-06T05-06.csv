That's culture, just bad culture. Everyone seems to be able to relate to bad culture. Company culture is a two way street, good culture seems harder to come by than bad. I can't even say I've even been somewhere with 'good' culture but it definitely exists and is really just the inverse of bad culture.<p>I'd say one of the things that draws people to telecommute most is too much exposure to bad company culture.

Sometimes I tell him, sometimes I just deploy if I'm in the middle of pushing something out. Building startups is all about iteration. One person sees something from one point of view, the next sees it from another. As each person adds their improvements you get a much better final product - you wouldn't be changing it if you didn't see something wrong with it.<p>By the same token, I totally accept when the things I've spent hours pouring over get thrown out the door. We recently had a design review where someone said one of the elements I put hours into looked like a 3 year old had drawn it (they didn't know it was done by me, they thought it was outsourced). It was the kind of style I was going for, but that reaction made me realise it totally wasn't suitable for the site. I was a little hurt of-course, made a joke about it and brushed it off. We now have a completely new version of this page that's way better than my original vision.<p>Wrong response:
You fucking trimmed my copy.
I dont want to get mad but I sat there for FIVE HOURS crafting that yesterday, theres a reason for every word.<p>Right response:

I understand that software moves faster than tangible products, but that just means ""innovation"" means something different in software. As a programmer, I oppose any effort to devalue software relative to other intellectual pursuits.<p>#2 Devalues genius. If a genius only needs 2 weeks to produce real genuine medical innovation, it should not be measured against some arbitrary measured effort standard quantifying ""evidence of research"".<p>#2 Also enforces arbitrary business requirements on software-using firms. Why can't a firm invent a lot of stuff and not implement it all at once? They should have the same rights to use their inventions as firms that work in other pursuits. (Again, this is dependent on the innovations being genuine.)<p>#3 Devalues software relative to manufacturing by applying a different standard.<p>These are hard problems that I can't answer at the moment; I'll freely admit that. But I continue to be shocked that the programming community tends to put forth answers that devalue its efforts, so I feel the need to point out that software is as worthy of protection as other fields.

Unfortunately the two landed on some scattered cinderblocks which created an even higher risk for serious injury. Steve was able to leave the ER with 19 staples in his head with a broken rib and sternum, while Eli stayed for further testing. The fall resulted in the fracturing of Eli's C6 and C7 vertebraes in the neck which have left him a paraplegic with some mobility of his arms. Eli is currently at the Albany Medical Center in an Intensive Care Unit recovering from his emergency surgery that succesfully realigned the two verebrae and released pressure from nerves in the surrounding area. His medical bills are rapidly stacking up and will continue to do so as he must be transfered to a hospital in New York City to be closer to his family. This ambulance ride alone will cost thousands of dollars. This inspired me to start a campaign to raise money for Eli's family. With facebook and twitter, we were able to raise over $3,000 in under 24 hours. The campaign continues to raise funds to help my friend.<p>www.indiegogo.com/love4eli",1341552169

You might have family and/or financial responsibilities that make you have to keep such a job.  You may be bootstrapping a business on the side so you can escape from such a job, but in the meantime, you still need your regular paycheck.<p>Not every job has you working with self-motivated co-workers and great bosses.  Some jobs put you in a cube farm in a room where everyone fights over the thermostat.  Sometimes you have to head a weekly meeting where you have to explain to other programmers why you get NullPointerExceptions on line 5 when line 4 initializes the variable to null.  Some jobs still make you use CVS.  The office talk at some jobs is never about learning anything, but it sure is loud and distracting.<p>If you were offered a chance to work from home and avoid a lot of that, I'm sure you'd also jump at the opportunity.

4206396,comment,4203443,4205798,3,0,aphyr,,,"Huh, I find the syntax for literals a breath of fresh air--but I also grew up in languages with rich data structure literals and find the {}, (), [], #"""", #{} distinctions make it much easier for me to understand, at a glance, the shape of a structure. I also prefer the vector notation for arguments in (fn [arg1 arg2 & friends])--the brackets make it easier to recognize the argument boundaries, especially in one-liners.<p>In general, Clojure code seems to have less nesting, which makes it easier for me to read and parse. You're honestly the first person I've heard express a dislike for the reader forms, so I thought it was universally liked.<p>I think you're right: a lack of configurable reader macros is a problem. I'd also point to the lack of tail recursion (and consequent mucking about with (recur) and (trampoline) as a notable flaw in Clojure. Its error messages are pathologically malicious. On the other hand, I think Clojure's packaging environment, thanks to lein and clojars, is quite good. There also seems to be more consistency in Clojure coding... style? preference? than in CL, which I attribute partly to its young age and small user base, but also, perhaps, to a more opinionated set of attitudes around mutability and types.<p>Regarding the #() form, I almost never reach for it, partly because it never seems to work as expected. (fn) and (partial) feel more natural to me, so I've never taken the time to understand how #() works.<p>I also prefer Lisp-1s in general, although I understand that's a more contentious differentiation.<p>Either way, my CL experience is minimal, so it was wrong of me to claim these as obvious improvements. I'll defer to your expertise here: it sounds like you've used CL enough to understand it better.",1341551777

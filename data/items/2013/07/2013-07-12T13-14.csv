The question is whether or not you have a theory that can be analyzed to see if this is a CAUSE or not... and we can&#x27;t test every correlated thing out there exhaustively.",1373637580

I can&#x27;t recall any lawless institution that all of the sudden became lawful of its own accord:<p>> &quot;NSA does not have a statutory charter; its operational responsibilities are set forth exclusively in executive directives first issued in the 1950s. One of the questions which the Senate asked the Committee to consider was the &quot;need for specific legislative authority to govern the operations of...the National Security Agency.&quot;<p>> According to NSA&#x27;s General Counsel, no existing statutes control, limit, or define the signals intelligence activities of NSA. Further, the General Counsel asserts that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to NSA&#x27;s interception of Americans&#x27; international communications for foreign intelligence purposes.&quot;<p>> <a href=""http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book3/pdf/ChurchB3_10_NSA.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book3/pdf/C...</a>",1373637508

And he is directly challenging a passage from Gladwell (I can&#x27;t recall off-hand how many Korean dialogue examples Gladwell actually sites, so it may be that the OP is cherry picking).<p>Anyway, the OP&#x27;s intent is to show that in these Korean passages, Gladwell apparently cherry-picks and edits the otherwise innocuous dialogue in a misleading way:<p>-----<p>There is the sound of a man shifting in his seat. A minute passes.
0121:13 CAPTAIN: Eh... really... sleepy. [unintelligible words].
FIRST OFFICER: Of course.
Then comes one of the most critical moments in the flight. The first officer decides to speak up:
FIRST OFFICER: Don&#x27;t you think it rains more? In this area, here?
The first officer must have thought long and hard before making that comment . . . [W]hen the first officer says: &quot;Don&#x27;t you think it rains more? In this area, here?&quot; we know what he means by that: Captain. You have committed us to visual approach, with no backup plan, and the weather outside is terrible. You think we will break out of the clouds in time to see the runway. But what if we don&#x27;t? It&#x27;s pitch-black outside and pouring rain and the glide scope is down. 
There is no nice way of saying this: this portion of Gladwell&#x27;s writing is ridiculous in several ways.<p>First, the way in which Gladwell quoted the transcript is severely misleading. This is the full transcript, which goes from pp. 185 to 187 of the NTSB report:
CAPTAIN:  ... ... ... () [eh... really... sleepy... (unintelligible words)]
FIRST OFFICER:   [Of course]
FIRST OFFICER:      [Captain, Guam condition is no good]FIRST OFFICER:  Two nine eighty-six
CAPTAIN:  !    [Uh, it rains a lot]CAPTAIN:  (unintelligible words)
CAPTAIN:     20   [Request twenty miles deviation later on]
FIRST OFFICER:   [yes]
CAPTAIN:  ...   [... to the left as we are descending]
(UNCLEAR SPEAKER):  (chuckling, unintelligible words)
FIRST OFFICER:    ?  . [Don&#x27;t you think it rains more? In this area, here?]
(emphases mine)<p>Note the difference between the full transcript, and the way Gladwell presented the transcript. Gladwell only quoted the first two lines and the last line of this sequence, omitting many critical lines in the process. In doing so, Gladwell wants to create an impression that the first officer underwent some period of silent contemplation, and decided to warn the captain of the poor weather conditions in an indirect, suggestive manner.<p>The full transcript reveals that this is clearly not the case. The first officer spoke up directly, clearly, and unmistakably:  &quot;Captain, Guam condition is no good.&quot; It is difficult to imagine how a person could be more direct about the poor weather condition. Further, there was no silent contemplation by the first officer. Nearly three minutes elapse during this sequence, during the captain and the first officer chatted constantly.

In order for a file of size X to be mapped to some smaller size Y, some file of size Y or smaller must be mapped to a file of size X or larger. The only way lossless compression can work is if some possible files can be identified as being more probable than others; in that scenario, the likely files will be shrunk and the unlikely ones will grow.<p>As a simple example, suppose that one wishes to store losslessly a file in which the bits are random and independent, but instead of 50% of the bits being set, only 33% are. One could compress such a file by taking each pair of bits and writing &quot;0&quot; if both bits were clear, &quot;10&quot; if the first bit was set and the second one not, &quot;110&quot; if the second was set and the first not, or &quot;111&quot; if both bits were set. The effect would be that each pair of bits would become one bit 44% of the time, two bits 22% of the time, and three bits 33% of the time. While some strings of data would grow, others would shrink; the ones that shrank would--if the probability distribution was as expected--outnumber those that grow (4/9 files would shrink by a bit, 2/9 would stay the same, and 3/9 would grow).</i>",1373636384

As another poster pointed out, Microsoft has been quick to answer the privacy related questions that have been asked about this situation with the claim that the system has been built with privacy as a focus.  As such, the reliability of those claims in light of this new leak appears to be relevant.<p>For example, given a court order, would Microsoft be required to:<p>1.) Provide law enforcement with Kinect data. (everything from as simple as &quot;there were two people in the room&quot; to &quot;here is a live stream of the room&quot;<p>2.) Be bound by gag orders not allowing Microsoft to reveal the existence of item 1.<p>3.) Be forced/coerced/enticed to provide bulk &quot;wiretapping&quot; of Kinect data.<p>Additionally, there is the question of &quot;expectation of privacy&quot;.  Many of the current privacy laws are based on this concept.  However, could the courts decide that there is no expectation of privacy when a video and audio recording device has been placed in a private area, with full knowledge of the owner, also with knowledge that the data will be sent to a third party?<p>While these items might seem fringe (and before these leaks, I may have agreed), the scope of the current leaks seems to imply that these questions should at least be considered (even if a person chooses ultimately to accept the risk).",1373634854

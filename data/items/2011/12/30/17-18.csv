On the other hand, if people don't want to pay for that, then of course they would never vote for a law to make them do that.<p>In most countries people do not vote for individual laws. Instead we trust the politicians to write laws we like. This means the government being a single huge entity can have a more holistic plan where less obvious groups get left out in the cold.<p>I for one have no idea what groups really need help in our society and do not want to spend time to figure it out so am very happy that I have a government doing that job for me.

The people that do tend to be very successful.<p>I think about all the ladles I have ever had. I don't think I have a single one I'd recommend. Here's a few things that pop into my mind as things I wish ladle makers cared about.<p>First, they all have the problem of not being able to catch anything when a bowl gets to the end. There's still stuff there, but a ladle becomes useless at getting the shallow stuff. Why are ladles are shaped like cups with handles? Why couldn't a ladle have a design to help sweep the bottom of round bowls?<p>Second, ladles are awkward to put anywhere after using. Their handles make them oddly balanced to lean on most things. They also tend to get very hot handles when spooning hot mixtures and you leave the thing in the bowl.<p>Third, I'm not sure I've ever successfully used a label to get a full ladle of anything in the target container (my cup) 2 times in a row.

One key feature for me was being able to easily switch between commit-list view and file-browse view (the latter to get to a file and view its history). I haven't tried Gitbox, because based on their feature list, it doesn't even come close to SourceTree, which in turn had less features than Tower.<p>One of my biggest problems is that all of these programs seem to emphasize pushing, pulling, merging, rebasing, etc. But I don't want any of that stuff, the command line is awesome for all that. I just want to search, browse, and compare commits a bit more easily.<p>There are a few small things Tower is still missing, but the Tower team have been really responsive and receptive to implementing those changes when I talked to them (which I think is a benefit of actually having to pay for the app).",1325267825

People give gifts for a LOT of different reasons. The trick for getting use out of this site is to be available at the exact right moment someone needs it (difficult, but doable) OR be memorable enough to be found when the person is thinking about gift giving (much harder, but also doable). Let's focus on the first objective: being available at just the right moment.<p>Thinking about how people shop for gifts on the internet, Google is an obvious first step (and the easiest to approach). patio11 makes a Bingo Card Creator which is pretty generic on its own. But the next thing he did was quite ingenious. He started generating custom landing pages for SPECIFIC segments within his product's market. For example, he would make a Christmas Bingo Card landing page, or an Astronomy Bingo Card landing page. He has a system which practically does this for him, requiring very little work up-front and a great deal of value over the lifetime of his product. I think it would be quite easy to replicate this process to work for you... making landing pages for Birthdays, Bar/Bot-mitzvahs, Graduations, etc. By creating custom landing pages, you can take advantage of Google's traffic to point people at microsites you've created for each (very specific) segment of the gift giving market (which is HUGE, btw). If you ask ANYONE (expecially Ramit Sethi) about marketing, they'll tell you to ""niche it down"".<p>There's a really good ""How-to"" direct from patio11 himself at <a href=""http://mixergy.com/patrick-mckenzie-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/patrick-mckenzie-interview/</a>.  You can also find more detailed information about his process at <a href=""http://appsumo.com/hacking-content-creation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appsumo.com/hacking-content-creation/</a>. (If you're feeling generous, earn me a few dollars of credit by using this link instead: <a href=""http://appsumo.com/hacking-content-creation/?r=cbhz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appsumo.com/hacking-content-creation/?r=cbhz</a>). I should also mention that patio11 shares LOADS of information about how he monetizes his Bingo Card creator on his blog. I'd start at <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/</a><p>Another way people shop for gifts on the internet is asking their friends about the person. This might take a little more effort on your part, but consider extending what you've started and let people create ""Gift Profiles"" for each other on your service. People already have wish lists on Amazon so why not make that experience a little more exciting (and memorable). While I can't tell you the best way to go about this, but there are plenty of interesting ways you could consider. For example, make a game out of it. How well do you know your friend? or ""This or That Gift"" where they narrow down a gift choice gradually getting points for gifts closer (instead of further) to what the recipient might like. Or, let people personalize their own gift list for specific occasions. Or allow people to put an embedded (and personalized) gift widget on their site. If the experience is good enough, people remember your service as well as be in the right place at the right time. Use these ideas to provide a better gift recommendation EXPERIENCE (this is key) than your competition.<p>Clearly, none of these things would have helped you in time for Christmas anyway, but Christmas is only one of many opportunities. Hope this helps.",1325267460

3408275,comment,3407643,3407643,0,0,colorado_hacker,,,"Well...I've been in the software engineering biz for a while now and go between being an engineer, an architect, and manager depending on the company and group.  I don't have any formal management training and don't even have a post-high school degree.  But I love building software (I started writing assembly on an Apple II+ way back when) and working with people and am in a constant state of learning.<p>The quick answer is that there's no easy path if you want to be good at this.  You need to be aware of your natural strengths and weaknesses, and what you've built up over the years to compensate.  If you can, find a mentor, or at the very least have regular lunches or coffee with folks with more experience.<p>It sounds like you are a technical leader with management responsibilities, which is a very tough position.  A lead/architect position without management duties usually means that you are involved with all technical decisions in the group but don't have direct reports.  When I'm an architect, I expect the majority of my time will be writing code with maybe 30%-40% of my time split between formal meetings and hallway conversations.  I will not take an architect position that has no hands on coding - it's a recipe for failure.  An architect/lead will need to understand the business and technical needs and help drive things forward so both sides are happy.  Look for quick wins here to keep things moving and 80/20 solutions.  Also know when to stand your ground on things that you know are wrong - be able to communicate your reasoning for both engineers and non-technical folks.  That role will also need to have strong technical vision and the ability to communicate that vision so other engineers will be able to follow the path.  Figure out the types of engineers and what they need to get their jobs done - some like diagrams, some like talks, some like code examples, some just need a few lines in an email.  Conversely, you'll need to be able to help the business side understand the technical side.  You'll also have to know your team and help with things like pushing things through to avoid engineer navel gazing, balancing NIH attitudes, breaking ties on proposed solutions, slotting in engineering driven changes that destabilize things, helping the engineers understand why they can't rewrite a key component of the system without showing the business value, helping the business understand why adding a fifth story to their building won't work because really have a bicycle, etc.<p>Architects are expected to be ""big dawgs"" in terms of technical skills, so it's ok to be opinionated and try to out-think others.  Your own style will come into play and you need to recognize it and be ok with how you work - you might be the type who doesn't suffer fools lightly and because you see the solution before anyone else, you just make your vision happen and ram it through.  Or maybe you have a high end team and you need to listen to the other ungodly smart people around you and do more consideration.  You do need to pay attention to other engineers and business folks, and listen to them.<p>A good manager requires an addition set of skills.  Management is really a career restart because you're really going down a whole new path.  The things that got you to the management position aren't the things that will make you a good manager.  Being the smartest person in the room does not a good manager make.  A good manager creates an environment for others to succeed.  A good manager listens a lot and doesn't try to come up with the solutions.  A good manager recognizes that the right idea will present itself because the team is awesome.  Try to come up with as many options at possible decisions points.  If a tiebreaker is needed, a manager should be able to argue both sides convincingly and not take sides (unless one side is just flat out wrong, but hopefully it won't come to that).  A good manager will let problems and solutions come up from the team.  Managers need to be aware that each person is different and adjusts to each person.  Depending on the group, they also need to have a slightly more balanced view of the business then an architect.  It does require some politiking as well - you shouldn't go into a meeting for a big decision without knowing where people stand ahead of time.  Managers also have to deal with the 'kindergarten' issues like ruffled feathers, misunderstandings, bruised egos, etc.  You'll need to know when someone is just venting versus needing your action.  And people have lives that impact the team as well - people get divorced, have kids, get sick, have people die on them, switch genders, come out of the closet, find Jesus, etc.  A good manager makes a personal connection and gets to know each person's story.  This lets you figure out where each team member is coming from and then how you can make sure their needs and values are met at work.  People are happy when what they want out of life lines up with what the company needs.  Managers need to know when someone on the team is causing issues and maybe isn't working out.  Letting someone go is tough, but usually it should be obvious to everyone involved that things aren't working out.  It also involves bearing bad news to both your team and other teams.  Telling the CEO that your team fucked up and caused customer level issues is rough.<p>Let's see...what else...hiring the wrong person is orders of magnitude more difficult than delaying a hire.  Be super picky when hiring, even if the executive staff is pushing you hard to fill those reqs.<p>Engineers like to solve problems, so presenting things in the form of a problem can be a useful approach.<p>Even if you have a solution in mind, start from the top and lead people through.  Let them come to the same conclusions you did and when they do, them tell them the pros/cons of each decision.<p>Sometimes you have to be the alpha dog and make a decision that someone heartily disagrees with - you need to understand their position, be able to echo it, and stay the course.<p>You cannot take on other's emotional issues - you can be aware and offer help, but you can't internalize them.<p>Try not to play favorites - this is tough because you'll find people that you connect with easier.<p>Put yourself out there, let the team get to know you as a person so that connection is better.<p>You need to keep in mind that you might have to fire anyone on your team at some point, or give them feedback they don't want to hear, etc.  So there's a fine line between becoming friends with folks and being their boss.<p>Have fun with it, I try to keep a sense of play with me because that's part of who I am.<p>I dunno - that's it for me - this was kind of a lot of stuff without much structure, but I wish you the best of luck.  This is a tough change for an engineer but the fact that you're asking these types of questions shows that you care and are willing to change to be better.",1325265663

3408264,comment,3407823,3407823,0,0,psykotic,,,"This is a fun puzzle. Here's my take on it. I stopped reading the article after the introduction so I could attack the problem fresh, so hopefully this isn't the same as what the author did.<p>The trick is working backwards. We want to quickly count the number of occurrences of each letter in the list of number words. Knowing how to do that, we just have to do a linear scan over the cumulative counts for A, B, C, ... to find the interval into which the query index fits. If it helps prime your intuition, my inspiration is counting sort with the counts evaluated partly analytically.<p>Number words can be divided into a fixed set of recurring components: one, two, three, four, ..., ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, ..., twenty, thirty, ..., hundred, thousand, million, billion. Build an inverse index that maps each letter to the set of all component words that contain the letter, paired with an occurrence count. For example, the inverse index would map T to {(two, 1), (three, 1), (ten, 1), (twelve, 1), (thirteen, 2), ...}.<p>With this in hand, the problem is reduced to counting the number of each component word in the string.<p>Let's consider that subproblem for the component 'nine' ('nineteen' and 'ninety' are separate components) for numbers with up to n digits. Numbers with the digit pattern xxx...xxx9 each contribute one occurrence of 'nine', and there are 10^(n-1) such numbers ('... nine'). Likewise each xxx...xxx9xx contributes an occurrence, and there are again 10^(n-1) such numbers ('... nine hundred ...'), the pattern xxx...xxx9xxx has 10^(n-1) members ('... nine thousand ...'), etc.<p>This same analysis applies to all ones components (one, two, three, ..., nine), and an analogous analysis applies to other components.",1325265377

Tries and BSTs are awesome for a lot of things but not what I was trying to do. If you read above, I don't search through each of the 1m words - I narrow down to the letter based on word-length and then find all possible words that match at least 66% of the letters that the user typed. This allows for typos and relaxes the filters. Going from 1m to 1000 words takes under 0.01s on iPad1 because of the bit-counting algo. The hard part is picking the best 5 out of the 1000 that match and is what takes some time. If user types 'CTA', how would pick the best match from hundreds of words like CATARACT, CITADEL, CANTINA, CRUSTACEAN etc.?<p>> For accuracy, consider arithmetic coding, and take a look at some of the work and writings from the Dasher project (<a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/</a>). In addition to their impressive input system, they've done a ton of work on accessibility.<p>Dasher was one of the inspirations for KType actually. When I came across it years ago, I tried to make it work for my cousin but it requires a lot of dexterity and timing, even when configured properly. And when I looked at it last, it did not support a high-level of word-completion / finishing sentences. On KType, if the user wants to type 'GIVE ME SOME FOOD', they type 'GV', select 'GIVE' on screen, then 'ME' on screen, then type 'S' and select 'SOME' and so on.<p>Additionally, KType can take input from external bluetooth devices and I'm working on making it accept input from bluetooth joysticks, so they wouldn't have to touch the screen at all. I also wrote a simple algo to ignore unintentional touches a user might make if they do not have fine motor skills: <a href=""http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20111105"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20111105</a><p>> Also, depending on your input system, you should consider the possibility of common typos or equivalent; for instance, on a keyboard you'd consider adjacent characters as likely typos.<p>In addition to handling typos, I offer a special keyboard layout to minimize the amount of movement a user would have to make when typing:  <a href=""http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20110228"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20110228</a><p>Last thing I wanted to do was reinvent the wheel for no reason.

So in your case I'm pretty sure that your choice was the best.<p>For me, your last point doesn't look very worrying, because from what I read if the company operations are in Italy then you are required to pay taxes here, but according to EU law you can rightfully incorporate in any EU country; so, if I do pay the taxes in Italy, there is nothing unlawful. Moreover, in my case, the website is (and will be) in English only and my market is 99% abroad.<p>More worrying is having to understand HOW I should pay my company's taxes here, and how to explain to the UK that I should't pay them there too... the worst scenario I can think of would be having to pay the corporate taxes twice until everything is clear, but if that becomes a problem it means that I already got traction, and at that point I could do everything I need to fix the situation.<p>What I really don't want is to spend a lot of money just to validate my product!",1325265029

I read that book either last year or early this year, and while it had some interesting points it felt highly padded.<p>It made me wonder, though, if the inclusion of a lot of touchy-feely content with emotional resonance was a technique to make things more memorable.  That is, people respond to stories more so than just facts, so wrapping your bare facts in a story leads to a more lasting impression and  (hopefully) action.<p>I still think most books could cut out a lot of their True Stories but it may not be all fluff.<p>My own true story: A few years ago at a local Ruby user group I was passing around some books, and one of them was about 100 pages and cost US $40.

That whatever tasks you have taken on for yourself, you may or may not get to them when you want to.  Accept that you will be the bridge between upper management and the technical folks and that you will be dealing with any number of issues.<p>Also, keep in mind that there are lots of resources out there about how to lead people and be a better leader.   Look to the Harvard Business Review ( <a href=""http://hbr.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hbr.org</a> ) for some good resources on how to be a better leader.<p>At the end of the day, as a lead, there is a process that you can follow to help you along.  The process includes the following:  1) Meet with your team and work out what tasks are assigned, follow up with each team member and confirm that they understand the assignment by asking them to describe to you what they think they are doing, follow up with each team member on their assignment and measure their progress, and finally, check in with them to review their work and let them know when they are done or have completed their assignment - then start again.   Use this process no matter how small or big the assignment is.<p>Some folks use an agile like approach to management of projects and one of the nice things out of this world is SCRUM and the concept of daily stand up meetings.   One of the things I would recommend is to get into the rhythm of meeting with your team for about 15 minutes every day to check progress, see what they have accomplished and see what they are working on for the next day and to see if there are any things keeping them from meeting their goals.  If you ever hear a complaint, that is a red flag and try to use whatever resources you have to remove those obstacles.<p>At the end of the day, you only have so much time and energy.

It would be nice to have a alternative system programming language. C sometimes feels like a local maximum instead of a global one.<p>From the PDF:<p>""The clean solution given in Oberon [6] is the concept of type extension, in object-oriented languages called inheritance. Now it became possible to declare a pointer as referencing a given type, and it would be able to point to any type which was an extension of the given type. This made it possible to construct inhomogeneous data structures, and to use them with the security of a reliable type checking system. An implementation must check at run-time, if and only if it is not possible to check at compile-time,.<p>Programs expressed in languages of the 1960s were full of loopholes. They made these programs utterly error-prone. But there was no alternative. The fact that a language like Oberon lets you program entire systems from scratch without use of loopholes (except in the storage manager and device drivers) marks the most significant progress in language design over 40 years.""",1325264802

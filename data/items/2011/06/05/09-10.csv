But it's sure going to be a hack.\nAlso, using Akka or OTP you get a lot of stuff for free: supervisor hierarchies, lightweight processes (not everyone must be an OS thread), pattern matching. So I would agree that pitching these technologies to garden variety web and mobile apps on the value proposition that it's better at dealing with multi-cores is disingenuous. As you said, it has its benefits there. But maybe some of the proponents are just using multi-cores to illustrate a general trend, and  maybe less of a singular value proposition.",1307267887

2621699,comment,2620974,2621633,1,0,sgentle,,,"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Steven Covey is a pretty seminal personal management book. It's my top recommendation in terms of ""foundational"" material. It's not got much in the way of practical tools, but the ideas are applicable everywhere.<p>I would recommend Drive by Dan Pink if you're interested in learning more about creative motivation. It's pretty short, and actually very well summarised here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc</a><p>Peopleware by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister is very good programmer-specific management material. They cite a lot of work benchmarking the productivity of different workplaces, so it's very ""x is good, x is bad"".<p>Jim Collins' Good to Great is an examination of businesses that succeed vs fail, and the attributes that get them there, it's essentially an extended summary of a longitudinal study he and his team did of businesses that outperformed the stock market by a high factor over 10 years. It's more leadership than management, but still very useful.<p>One that I haven't read yet (damn my stupidly big reading list) but recommend on reputation alone is First, Break All The Rules by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman. Here's a summary: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/gregcrouch/executive-summary-first-break-all-the-rules"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/gregcrouch/executive-summary-first...</a><p>I share your frustration about blah-blah blog posts. With the exception of First, Break All The Rules (which I haven't read yet) and 7 Habits (which I forgive because it's so damn good), the books I mention are based on actual research which is cited in the book, not just some dude going ""I think this because I know stuff"". Because they're books for busy people, they have summaries and bolded sections and callout boxes too. :)<p>Overall, though, I would caution you to not put the cart before the horse. There are a thousand books on management that could teach you something new, but it will all just go on the big pile of irrelevant information unless you actually need it. You won't unless you're actively trying to manage. If you start by spending that time you'll be much better placed to contextualise the knowledge and, therefore, actually benefit from it.",1307266849

Don't worry, The laws in A' would say the same things.<p>> Or you can try to change that legal context through force of arms, and deal with my side shooting back at your band of violent assholes.<p>If you saw someone carrying a blood-covered obviously stolen TV you'd try to (even if only indirectly by calling the police) violently (if necessary) change his context.

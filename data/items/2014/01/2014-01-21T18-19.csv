If they collect it, they can ensure a more representative sample size, even if they can&#x27;t ensure how that data is ultimately presented. If students start using a third party service, not only does Yale still not have control over presentation, the data collected will probably make the faculty look worse by virtue of the fact that disgruntled students are more likely to respond than happy students.",1390330788

7097394,comment,7092164,7092886,1,0,JeremyNT,,,"The issue with Windows 8 isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s unusable, obviously it can be used. The issue is that the changes to the desktop were made in service of a use case (that is: a full screen, mono-tasking, touch-based mode) that doesn&#x27;t really seem to exist on a desktop computer, and so the changes do not <i>improve</i> anything for most people using traditional systems.<p>Changing the way a UI functions has a cost to the user, and users expect that if they are willing to pay that cost they gain something in return. Once a user acclimates to it, perhaps Windows 8 is equally as usable as Windows 7 was, but given its relatively poor uptake I think it would be difficult to argue that many users actually find the experience <i>better</i>.<p>Ultimately, paying the &quot;learn a new interface&quot; cost for what is effectively side-grade is a poor value.<p>In contrast, for users of touchscreen-based Windows devices, this is a cost that is likely worth paying, since the features enhance usability for their hardware.

Just want to share some stuff that I haven&#x27;t seen others write about.<p>I don&#x27;t code much lisp these days (though getting into clojurescript a bit now), but when I used to, the cycle went pretty much like this -<p>1. Express what you want to express as an s-expression, capturing known structures in the simplest way I can think of.<p>2. Figure out which aspects can be &quot;functions&quot; straight forwardly and which are macros and implement them.<p>3. Test and iterate a bit till I like the way domain elements are composing and the way the composition looks in code. Try to reduce the required concepts in each iteration.<p>4. Document the relationships that have emerged from this process so others can understand it.<p>5. Usually I&#x27;m done, but sometimes (the few) users of my &quot;api&quot; come back with questions, based on which I iterate a bit more.<p>I&#x27;ve mostly followed this in building the &quot;editing style specification language&quot;[1] part of the product &quot;muvee Reveal&quot; (an automatic video editor)[2], built in a custom scheme dialect called &quot;muSE&quot;[3]. \n(Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve happily worked for muvee Technologies from 2002 to 2011.)<p>Btw - most discussion on macros and lisp seem to first assume that there two things - a) functions and b) macros. There are more, depending on the kind of lisp system you&#x27;re working with.<p>You could form a taxonomy of sorts based on whether argument forms are evaluated and whether the result form is evaluated -<p>1. Argument forms are evaluated before &quot;apply&quot;, result is a value (i.e. not evaluated). => Function<p>2. Argument forms are unevaluated before &quot;apply&quot;, result is code (i.e. is evaluated). => Traditional macro<p>3. Argument forms are evaluated before &quot;apply&quot;, result is code (i.e. is evaluated).<p>4. Argument forms are unevaluated before &quot;apply&quot;, result is a value. => Traditional macro (depending on system)<p>In the course of using the domain modeling approach above, I&#x27;ve written stuff like functions that create one or more macros, macros that evaluate to function values (not s-expressions) and such stuff that might be considered an &quot;abomination&quot; by the OP ... but in the context of the domain, the <i>concepts</i> are usually clear enough to be used without major issues.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/muvee-style-authoring/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/muvee-style-authoring/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.muvee.com/en/products/reveal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.muvee.com/en/products/reveal</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/muvee-symbolic-expressions/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/muvee-symbolic-expressions/</a>",1390330614

7097341,comment,7096455,7096455,14,0,yeukhon,,,"Disclaimer: I went to the conference (well it&#x27;s actually my school). The followings are supposed to be addressed during the QA but I could only ask one question... sorry for the long baffling.<p>This is the golden age for cryptography, thanks to education and hardworking people.<p>People are actively attacking our cryptographic knowledge and our implementations. As controversial as it may sound, if it weren&#x27;t all the active attacks on our cryptographic infrastructure, we probably will be okay with RC4 and MD5. Of course we know they are weak and they are not reliable.<p>So let&#x27;s thanks everyone, including the state-sponsored attackers.<p>This is golden age because we long know that relying on mathematical hardness assumptions is not safe. Maybe a decade later someone discover a theorem to factor large number very efficiently and then boom all the encrypted communications using RSA will be broken. We are slowly moving from that kind of dependencies. We think there are better ways to solve our encryption. Much like in 20th century the arm race gave rise to active advancement in all disciplines of engineering and science, cryptography is also growing.<p>Thanks to all the attackers out there we now know it is important to teach everyone about computer and web literacy. We know this should be part of education. In addition, we must make tools more accessible to users. At #realworldcrypto 2014 someone said PGP has been around what two decades? Why hasn&#x27;t everyone in the tech community using it? Why are my non-geek friends not using it? Why am I not using it? Servers that retain user data or transfer user data should all be over HTTPS now. Implement 301 redirect on http end points and on HTTPS endpint add HSTS header. Implement Content-Security-Policy to harden what resources can be loaded on your website. Add X-Frame-Options to control whether you want your site to be frame/iframed or not. I can go on and on but you get the point. This is a long battle and not easy to fix.<p>Cryptography is not dead. What is dead is our assumption that we can rely on assumptions and that kind of dependency is going to harm us some time in the future. For how many more years? We don&#x27;t know. It is possible no one can ever come up with an efficient algorithm to break factoring.<p>Yes. One problem in cryptography has to do with the key storage. I see that in the future HSM will be cheaper and people can enjoy that as opposed to a plaintext file in your $USER/.ssh/ directory. Look, cryptography is not silver bullet. You can&#x27;t eliminate people from making mistake, but we can look at what things can be improved to make mistake fail quick and safely. Idea? Maybe instead of one key, we have multiple partial keys stored on multiple servers? But key management and key synchronization is going to be a headache. And look, if someone inject a malware in the network and has some insight knowledge of the network, there is very little you can do.<p>Never confuse NSA revelation means we must implement things so secure that we can&#x27;t even tell Bob is Bob. We can&#x27;t have 100% anonymity and we can&#x27;t enforce that. The world needs interaction. The ability to choose is the right direction and I hope companies will start to realize that we don&#x27;t live in the 80s anymore.<p>The hardest problem to solve is to tell whether the server is doing what it is said. People are working on verifiable search but what about whether site is actually hashing your password? Client-side encryption is important and mufti-identity remain to be solved. Personally, I&#x27;d like to see Persona widely used so I can just set up my own federated authentication server to authenticate my own email.<p>Again, as controversial as it may sound, knowledge exists because we can think and because we can think we have desire and goals. Knowledge doesn&#x27;t grow out of the trees. The are always accidental and incidental. We don&#x27;t start inventing things out of the thin air. I like the idea of knowledge as Yin-Yang. We don&#x27;t start having cryptography because there is such a thing called cryptography. Because we want secret to be hidden and safe from evedropper, we invented substitution cipher schemes. Because we now have digital communication and we need to prevent MitM we need a better cryptography and this is why RSA and DHE are useful. We know SHA is never meant for hashing password because it&#x27;s fast so we invent other kinds of cryptographically hard hashing algorithms like bcrypt and scrypt. If it weren&#x27;t Miller&#x27;s paper on fuzzing, we probably would neglect fuzzing testing and our unix command line tools will probably continue to fail hard. If it weren&#x27;t NSA, how many of us would ever pay attention to the problem in OpenSSL and RNG? There is always a constant Yin-Yang interaction in the pursuit of knowledge. One nice property of security proof is that we always have to model the evil in our proof construction...",1390330264

My interest in literate code and readable code has recently accelerated in conjunction with my interest in code correctness. I think the way forward in both these contexts is through functional programming.<p>In particular I, and the IT shop at Tachyus, have chosen F# as the way to go forward for a number of reasons. Sticking to readability, F# (and other FPs to a greater or lesser extent) allow production code that &quot;reads&quot; more expressively in terms of conveying what the code is actually accomplishing to the reader (and to the compiler) rather than the frequently tangled instructions to the compiler on <i>how</i> to accomplish the task coming from traditional imperative and OO languages. F# also has some very useful tools to emit a form of literate code that produces publication ready HTML or MD, <a href=""http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tpetricek.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/</a> (This project will soon be accepted as a top-tier project by the F# Software Foundation, <a href=""http://fsharp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fsharp.org/</a>) It may not be <i>to the letter</i> of Knuth&#x27;s idea of literate programming, but certainly in the spirit.<p>I did <i>read</i> some code lately. Actually I had to go so far as stepping through it in the debugger to properly <i>decode</i> it, <a href=""http://jackfoxy.com/transparent-heterogeneous-parallel-async-with-fsharp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jackfoxy.com/transparent-heterogeneous-parallel-async...</a> (the code snippets here have tool-tips in my article, just one of the features available with FSharp.Formatting), but this is really the exception in F#. The vast majority of code is easily accessible to any programmer of reasonable quality (with proper introduction to FP) in any IT shop. The deeper functional stuff like Continuation Passing Style and Applicative Functors (e.g. heterogeneous parallel async) in most cases is already available in core libraries. And when not a literature search and/or getting in touch with the FP community helps.",1390329374

Existing payment systems charge fees of around 2 percent to three percent</i><p>As long as consumers are paid in their local currency and vendors pay their employees, their taxes, and their other costs in local currency, then bitcoin as a payment technology has similar costs as credit cards. Those costs are reflected through exchange fees and bid/offer spreads.<p>Let&#x27;s walk through a transaction. I want to buy something that costs 1 bitcoin. The going rate on the bitcoin exchange is $825 bid by $830 offered. I take my cash to the exchange and convert it to bitcoin. Assume exchange fees are .5%. To buy 1 bitcoin I pay $834.15 (fees included). I transfer the bitcoin to the vendor, who then does the reverse transaction. He recieves $820.875 (fees included). The cost for transaction was $13.275 (834.15 - 820.875) which comes out to 1.59%. That is cheaper than the oft quoted 2.5% rate for credit cards but is very much in the same ballpark. If you factor in that some credit cards give you 1% cash back then bitcoin and credit cards are back at basically even in terms of net transaction costs.<p>With bitcoin as a payment technology, the transaction costs flow to the bitcoin exchanges, market makers, and dealers. A dealer is sort of like an exchange combined with a market maker. The dealer quotes you a price to buy or sell bitcoins and you transact directly (not on an exchange). The dealer, like a market maker, makes money on the bid/ask spread. The only reason I&#x27;m going on about this is because one of a16z&#x27;s big bitcoin investments is in a company called Coinbase, which is a bitcoin dealer. When you buy or sell bitcoins with Coinbase, Coinbase always takes the other side of the transaction. They make money on the bid/ask spread, and in some cases (&quot;instant exchange&quot;) they charge you a 1% fee <i>on top</i>. It&#x27;s a pretty clever business.<p>Just putting this out here so that everyone understands how the guys out there touting bitcoin for payments plan to make money from the people using bitcoin for payments.",1390329359

I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone ever suggesting letting suffering children die as some way to keep the population low. He brings up Malthus as another straw man.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the point he&#x27;s trying to make. To stop people from stopping people from saving people&#x27;s lives? I <i>think</i> he&#x27;s trying to suggest that the planet has too many people on it but that shouldn&#x27;t stop us from saving people&#x27;s lives. I know a lot of people who consider the planet overpopulated and I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone suggesting letting babies die would help, let alone consider it remotely human.<p>He seems to conclude educating women and making birth control available helps most. Why not just make that point? I feel like he&#x27;s trying to imply those who disagree with him or agree with Malthus are tantamount to baby-killers.<p>On another (lighter) note, since dromedaries are camels too, calling the &quot;camel world&quot; a &quot;bactrian world&quot; would be more clear. The fun mnemonic for camel names is that the Dromedary has one hump and the Bactrian has two, like the first letters of their names, &#x27;D&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27;, turned sideways.<p>EDIT: Moreover, these statements are at odds, or at least need more explanation to connect them.<p>&quot;It may be counterintuitive, but the countries with the most deaths have among the fastest-growing populations in the world. This is because the women in these countries tend to have the most births, too.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;Human beings are not machines. We don’t reproduce mindlessly. We make decisions based on the circumstances we face.&quot;<p>The first point suggests people have extra babies in anticipation of some of them dying before adulthood. The second implies they would target a certain number to reach adulthood, which would not itself lead to overpopulation. What would lead to overpopulation on a broad scale would be individuals benefiting from more children than the planet would, which is more like a tragedy of the commons.<p>If people decide based on circumstances, then they wouldn&#x27;t have too many children for whatever their values decide, independent of child mortality. They&#x27;d have the right number. If they are having the right number for themselves, then food and medicine wouldn&#x27;t affect their target number of children.<p>Bringing up food and medicine is a red herring. There may be a myth (which they don&#x27;t establish), but it&#x27;s irrelevant to the point made in that section: increase education and birth control. It confuses unrelated issues and paints people concerned with population as ignorant and cruel.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me where their logic suggests I should contribute resources.

For example, the web PKI is completely compromised if a single CA key is compromised, but chrome can detect valid but forged google certs using key pinning and thereby alert the world.

The article covers misconceptions all over the place, but it keeps coming back to Africa, and it seems that the disparity between what people think and what&#x27;s actually the case is far larger there than anywhere else.<p>It would be easy to blame this on casual racism and move on. And I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a factor. But there must be more.<p>I wonder if there might just be a cliff effect in people&#x27;s perceptions. The perception of China, for example, changed rapidly from &quot;shithole&quot; to &quot;where all our stuff is made&quot;. India quickly switched from &quot;shithole&quot; to &quot;where our IT gets outsourced&quot;. (And reminder, I&#x27;m talking about <i>perceptions</i> here, specifically in the US, or possibly the western world as a whole.) I wasn&#x27;t around for it, but I have the impression that more or less the same thing happened for e.g. Taiwan and Japan.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, then Africa is still in the &quot;shithole&quot; perception category simply because we don&#x27;t see much of them. Not much of our stuff comes with a &quot;Made in Kenya&quot; label on it, and our experience with IT-related outsourcing to Africa is mostly limited to Nigerian scammers. Once that changes, the perception will rapidly go from &quot;those guys have no food&quot; to &quot;those guys are taking all of our jobs&quot;.<p>A counterpoint would be South America, which is not overall perceived as &quot;shithole&quot; but nor is it a place we interact with a whole lot.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s just mental inertia.

There&#x27;s nothing inherently <i>wrong</i> with it, but sooner or later, the only way to correct for broken or missing functionality is (to borrow your term) to add more glue. And if you want more correct behavior, you either have to wait for the distro maintainers to fix it or fix it yourself only to merge your changes back in on the next OS update.<p>That&#x27;s another thing I like about systemd. With the separation of &quot;stock&quot; unit files in /usr/lib and user-supplied ones in /etc/systemd, you can override the ones distributed by your OS vendor without worrying about updates breaking your changes. That&#x27;s already saved me once or twice during Arch&#x27;s transition from sysvinit to systemd, in fact.<p>One thing that comes to mind is an issue I had some time back with running a proprietary service in a manner that would allow the init system to control it when it forked itself a number of times and spun up separate processes. start-stop-daemon was confused by this behavior and it required some tricks to collect the approriate PID just to be able to stop the service (I may be wrong, but I think it was the TeamSpeak 3 daemon which behaves weirdly). systemd&#x27;s use of cgroups ignores this rubbish entirely, because it&#x27;s effectively impossible for systemd to lose track of what processes belong to which service. Want to kill the service? No problem.<p>Some in this thread seem convinced that systemd is a solution looking for a problem, but I suspect some of them lack experience with systemd. Or stubbornly cling to their ideals of what an init system should do. I like the unification of a supervisor-type service and the init system. It makes my job easier.

7097059,comment,7081502,7094971,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,"What you say is certainly true in general, but it doesn&#x27;t take into account the threat model of a supposed malicious extension. The threat model here is that someone decides to significantly alter the behavior of an extension <i>after it gains traction and a certain level of trust</i>. For this to work would require the extension to include an interpreter or some other mechanism from the start. They would essentially have to think &quot;if this gains traction I may want to start silently injecting ads/stealing information, so why don&#x27;t I include this interpreter in it now just in case&quot;. While possible, it isn&#x27;t very likely.<p>The other problem with the security model is that all extensions are seemingly created equal. I would think that a large majority of extensions do not require access to any external resources besides the ones downloaded from the webpage itself. Think of a youtube downloader, flashblock, etc. These types of extensions should have a different security model that is constrained to restrict any web request calls besides to the domain of the page and perhaps any domains that page calls (to take into account cdns). These types of extensions shouldn&#x27;t need any consideration of security implications to install. There&#x27;s no reason why a youtube downloader should have the potential to steal my passwords down the line. More involved extensions that would require generic http requests could have the warning about data access.<p>I see in your profile that you know a thing or two about chrome extensions, so I will defer to your expertise on whats possible. It just seems like with the proper constraints for different levels of access one can have much greater security than we have now just treating all extensions the same.",1390327959

Oh well.<p>Essentially, artists have a lot of &quot;credit&quot; (i.e. they can elicit services for cheap due to the massive exposure it might get), but very little cashflow. They usually pay their living expenses through signing bonuses and use the rest of the contract money to finance the production of the album. In this specific case Kanye used a large amount of his own signing bonus for Late Registration to pay for the videos, while using the bare minimum the studio would give him to pay for <i>just</i> the directors. While theoretically he still would have had a lot of earning potential, and probably would have kept at least some of his &quot;credit&quot; if LR failed, he still would have been extremely cash poor. Kanye frequently talks about how bad he is with money and spending habits, so his financial situation was most likely pretty precarious.<p>Side note: this is part of the &quot;scam&quot; of record labels... they purposely keep the economic buying power away from the artists&#x27; wallet and keep it tied to the artists&#x27; image, which just so happens to be very dependent on the studio&#x27;s continued marketing efforts.

For example, wouldn&#x27;t those perverse incentives you mention be in place already, given that providing feedback to professors was the whole point? Ratings don&#x27;t magically transform from useful evaluation tools to misguided oversimplifications just because students have convenient access to them. Either they carry useful information or they don&#x27;t.<p>[1] I&#x27;m not taking a free expression absolutist position here. (I&#x27;m tempted to, but it&#x27;s totally unnecessary for this discussion.) The point is that to the degree to which you make rules about what kind of thing people can express is, well, trivially the degree to which you limit free expression. And limiting the ability of students to transmit truthful data about the courses they&#x27;re taking is a very strong limitation, and it would be hard to formulate a consistent, principled policy that permits this kind of restriction and doesn&#x27;t just say, &quot;you can&#x27;t say things we don&#x27;t like&quot;.",1390327543

And people expected &quot;Windows RT&quot; to be compatible with &quot;Windows&quot;, since before then, pretty much all things that were marketed as &quot;Windows&quot; were compatible, to some extent. And no-one understood what &quot;RT&quot; meant.<p>Contrast this situation with Apple: all the mobile devices (from really small to pretty large) run iOS, and many of the Apps are cross-platform. The desktops run something completely different; contrast this back again with Microsoft&#x27;s attempt to get the same thing running on desktops AND tablets, but - of course - only SOME tablets.

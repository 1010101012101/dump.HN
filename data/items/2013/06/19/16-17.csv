And in which the consumables for the $50 inkjet were also less than 1/10 the price.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m referring to the near future, not the present. Currently, drones are still quite expensive.

The primary protector of our liberties has been economics: the government couldn&#x27;t afford to follow many of us.  If we weren&#x27;t mostly law-abiding citizens, LE would be easily overwhelmed.<p>But technology changes all that.  Putting a helicopter in the air with a police pilot is a huge expense.  Putting a thousand drones in the air is cheaper.  And the benefit doesn&#x27;t stop there.  Computers can correlate data, follow individuals, listen in, eliminating the need for an army of support people.  A few agents at their desks can lay out the overall plan, and software can implement &quot;Big Brother&quot;.<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more.  As tech makes us wealthier, it also makes our government wealthier, while lowering the cost of drones, bandwidth, servers, software, etc.  So in a decade, we could have perhaps ten thousand drones instead of one thousand.

5906685,comment,5888215,5906566,1,0,johnnyg,,,"In short, no, we are from all over.<p>Several things are going on here:<p>1. There are a lot of projects available nearly all the time. You could say &quot;oh, so you work more for less and call that good&quot; or you could say &quot;it is a pain point of contracting to be forever negotiating a new project that will just end in days or months, to be renegotiated again. What if there was a pool of work always available and I could scoop it up as I wished and contract out for it under known terms&quot;? Less money, but more reliable money when you are free to do the work as you can see the fire hose.<p>2. The pay goes up. Informally, we&#x27;ll name/label &quot;epic projects&quot; and hand them to veteran contractors. On clean completion, I&#x27;ll get a &quot;hey, its time to talk hourly rate&quot; email and will bump rates.<p>3. F U, pay me. I do, reliably. This is a big deal.<p>4. It is home brew code base PHP work, which does tend to be a bit cheaper than RoR or CMS work.<p>5. Interesting work. We&#x27;ve rolled our own custom warehouse software. Our own queue system. File and fax storage engine. Purchase forecasting software. On and on. Yes, there&#x27;s rote work and yes things go wrong now and again but in general once you are up to speed you are going to get something cool. When you fight that dragon, you&#x27;ll do so with the help of a lot of people who know more than you. So you won&#x27;t be bored and you&#x27;ll come out stronger.<p>6. Me. I&#x27;m GM but also a (middling) coder. A lot of people doing contract work HATE these things:<p>a. Here are project specs, they have no relation to how databases are designed or how software is built, but do your best. PS, we&#x27;re not going to use a ticketing system or code versioning to reference changes, just email me.<p>b. Refactor? No, no money or time for that. Just get this feature in.<p>c. Idea? No, can&#x27;t trust you. Code review before push? We don&#x27;t do that, so you are dangerous.<p>I think (and hope) we do a better job than most here and it makes us sticky.<p>7. Picky. We are fairly picky when it comes to enjoying working with a fellow contractor or full time person. If they have the chops but there&#x27;s not a click, we pass. Seriously. Even when there&#x27;s a pressing technical need. This makes for a nice group with less of the usual software pain. People tend to take a project, then another, then kind of keep taking them as can while mixing in that $100/hr, 5 hour project when it comes along.<p>Works for us.

My objection to the implicit conversions is mostly when they&#x27;re used with DSLs. Our project used several libraries that each implemented their own DSLs that of course made use of implicit conversions.<p>There were two things struck me as questionable about the extensive DSL support in Scala. First, Scala source files that used one library&#x27;s DSL ended up looking like they were written in a different language than Scala source files using another library&#x27;s DSL. That, to me at least, makes it harder to read the source quickly and understand whats going on. This wasn&#x27;t a horrible problem, but I found it somewhat burdensome to reorient myself when switching between DSLs, so I feel like it&#x27;s an overall negative feature of the language. Sort of the opposite of the benefit that more consistant looking languages like Python and Go provide.<p>It also means, at least for me, that and IDE is necessary in order to understand what&#x27;s going on in source files using certain DSLs. I&#x27;m an Emacs user and this is the first time I&#x27;ve felt like I really should have been using an IDE, which was irritating.<p>My second objection was that because of ambiguities between implicit conversions in different DSLs, source files that used more than one DSL had to fall back on explicit conversions and therefore not really use the DSLs. That made some source files using a given library look very different from other source files using the same library, since one was written using the DSL and the other wasn&#x27;t.<p>This is really my major objection to the language. In many other ways I really enjoyed Scala and wish I could use it more. Yet I wish DSLs and implicit conversions were used much more sparingly in Scala libraries.",1371659423

If and when new important virus&#x27;s are found (like Flame), the signature for that virus may be pushed out immediately, triggering a full scan.  In the case of Flame the signer(Microsoft) was revoked, triggering a new full scan.<p>Why is AV so slow?  Most AV vendors have a huge signature of virii, and have to search each file for matching patterns (often having to match different sections of the file).  Each new virus adds a new pattern, and adds just that little bit more overhead.  There are some projects to do a predictive engine, but that requires overhead itself, and ends up really needing a lot more resources (block on every action while your predictive engine determines if the process doing the action is behaving or not, like having a Big Brother hanging out in your OS).<p>I use both MFE and Windows on different computers, and remember, even if you install another AV, Windows Defender is still partially enabled on Win8+, probably because Windows is taking security more seriously.",1371659361

5906440,comment,5905698,5905975,5,0,jonhmchan,,,"I went to NYU, and I disagree.<p>I am not from a rich family. No one in my family earned a college degree before me and they immigrated to the States with little to nothing. They were smart enough to start saving early for my education so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay a dime, but despite that, I still have loans. Thankfully I&#x27;m well on my way to paying them off, and early, because of the skills and the network I think I could have only built at NYU and NYC at large. I have the job I have because I went to NYU.<p>It&#x27;s true that this is not the ideal place to become a hermit and focus on maximizing your GPA. I argue that higher education is far more involved than your studies - it&#x27;s about exposing yourself to new experiences, honing your social senses and building a strong network, among other soft skills that are not summarized by your transcript. There are few better places in the world to do so than in NYC and specifically within NYU as a college student.<p>Lastly, going through NYU was not a vacation. I was very aware - as well as everyone else I knew was as well - that NYU was a ridiculously expensive place to be going to: nearly a quarter of a million dollars for an education with everything accounted for. If I screwed this up, all that money would be wasted, so study up. Not only that, study up, but resist the weakness to indulge in the &quot;distractions&quot; of the city and let your grades suffer.<p>In short, to say that NYU students are all rich kids is overgeneralizing, to think that studying in college is your one priority is myopic, and to call an NYU experience a &quot;vacation&quot; is just insulting.

Why is it that I, as a parent, can&#x27;t tell that person to keep his/her hands off my little girl?  What happened to the presumption of innocence?<p>At any US airport you are presumed guilty and have to demonstrate your innocence by being subject to search and seizure (swiss army knives, shampoo, etc. taken away --your property).<p>This TSA problem is an analog of the surveiilance problem.  The vast majority of the people logging 1.6 billion person-trips per year [1] are not terrorists.  Yet, 100% of them are presumed guilty and subject to search and seizure.  And we allow it.<p>Now we have a situation where 100% of Americans are presumed to be potential terrorists in the future [2].  Based on that \nWe now justify logging and tracking your every move and every communication.<p>Steve Wozniac is right, this is what we were told others did to their population, not us.  We were above that, better than that.

This externality will differ by city, line, time of day, etc, and it would include external costs of traffic, parking, car accidents, among others. Economists can approximate this sort of thing.\nWe are often really bad at accounting for externalities because they aren&#x27;t immediate dollars in or out of our pockets and lack certainty (pollution controls, infrastructure improvements, etc), but this case may be a bit more straight forward.",1371657752

We don&#x27;t know anything about samples sizes, etc.<p>#2 The main detail they talk about changing was changing from a movie to a still picture. This is a lot different than changing a button&#x27;s color - many people will see a movie and close the page if they are in a quiet environment such as work or a library.<p>So it could very well contradict the A/B testing article by Wired and still be correct - or it could be wrong.

One current trend is to charge drivers for access to congested areas: congestion charges in city centers, toll roads along congested routes, and fast-track toll lanes on non-toll highways. An alternate approach is to spend that money on getting other people off the road: subsidize transit so that some percentage of my would-be fellow drivers get off the road and onto buses or trains, leaving a less congested road for me.",1371657609

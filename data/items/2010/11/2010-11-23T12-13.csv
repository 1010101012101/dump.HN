I prefer to eat locally grown produce and (attempt) to grow my own vegetables.  I do think a lot about reducing consumption both from a calorie and cost point of view - I'd rather have two good steaks than 7 bad ones.  I'd like to take this further but being in a family does tend to restrict the ability to dictate the diet, especially if you don't produce the majority of the meals.<p>I have no intention of ever giving up meat products but there is a lot in what you say that people should honestly appraise what they are eating and ask if it is because it is what they really feel like eating, or what they should be eating, or if it is just because it is 7 oclock and time to consume some dead animal.  I'm going to re-appraise this and see if I can approach it from a different angle.",1290516976

I agree that some EE projects are overly-complicated (EJB, etc.) and make simple tasks seem difficult. ...However, there's usually a reason - and, the bottom line is that you probably don't need to use those projects anyway.<p>However, when u write a non-trivial app (more than a web front-end or REST API), java starts to shine: there are soooooo many open source projects available with friendly commercial licensing, good tools for debugging, etc.etc., that you <i>save</i> a lot of time by just incorporating things rather than writing things.<p>This is not to say other languages don't provide these features - rails has some nice momentum (growing list of projects), python too, and say what u will about msft, c#/asp.net is a good combo (VS.NET is a great dev environment, and there is a relatively small but growing open-source movement - and Mono is fantastic for cross-platform work).<p>...but i'd say that the massive amount of effort and open source projects in java have been a godsend for my work - especially recently - and saved me enormous amounts of time.<p>...also, I've found that recent groovy and grails versions have made web dev super simple...and u can call all your java code ease.

Just try to extend it...or talk to an external service. yes, you can wrap your services with REST APIs...or use something like thrift...and i know there are several successful companies that use it (facebook, etc.etc.) - and i've been part of companies that use it too...but i think PHP puts yourself in handcuffs that a startup shouldn't really need. ...and it creates a ""silo"" around web development - not a good way to get going.<p>my $0.02. ;-)",1290515805

Some do not, some have very poor diets indeed. There is no dichotomy here, though.<p>On the topic, while the most hard-line vegans will disagree, I think milk, eggs and non-sentient beings like various clams, oysters and such are a reasonable compromise in ensuring one's nutrition.

It'd be more accurate to say each story goes through its own mini-waterfall, but even that's wrong as the stages are almost completely different and not in the same order.  For example, few teams write requirements beyond the story's acceptance criteria, specifications are almost never written, testing occurs throughout the lifecycle, and maintenance would come in the form of another story.

Although there's a lot of power there there's also a lot of tangled XML and you need to do a fair amount of gymnastics to get through it all. Server restarts are common and painful. Getting exception stacks that run 200 classes deep are IMHO a bad sign.<p>Play is a total breath of fresh air. REALLY well thought out, clean, simple, fast:<p>- almost no server restarts needed, 
- runs very very quickly in production
- stateless, so zero downtime deployments are trivial
- great community 
- extendable with modules<p>Then there are all the little things. Libraries to do things like encryption and image resizing are built in and just work. Everything just works.<p>I can't recommend it enough. It really does liberate Java from the Enterprise shackles.",1290514801

1. know what the hell you are talking about
2. have experience in the things you want to do
3. become known in the community<p>Expanding:
1. If you say that you know what the hell you are talking about, and your O(n^2) algorithm for computing something for someone's app used to work but now falls to pieces with more widgets, then you really don't.  Learn how to design and analyze algorithms to fit the task at hand.  I don't know how many times I've cleaned up someone's O(n^2) or O(n^3) algorithm to O(n) because either they didn't know the language or just weren't very good, but it's at least 20 times at this point.  If you want to self-start, check out MIT's OpenCourseware.  It has a free computer science education that will result in zero paper.  Lectures are available online for free.<p>2. Don't just read a bit about a new technology that you want to get a job doing, actually use it.  There are free VM solutions that will run on your hardware and OS combination, which will let you run and test any number of software configurations to see what it's like.<p>3. If you're really using the software, and you don't run into a bug, then you're not really using the software.  Report bugs, fix bugs, get involved.  Every project needs help; the more you help people, the more you are known; the more you are known, the better your resume.<p>There are people who have never had a problem getting a job without having a degree.  And there are some people who haven't been able to get a position, regardless of their degree.  Personally, my degrees have opened doors that would otherwise never have been open to me.  And the education that I have acquired <i>in school</i> has been invaluable to actually performing my duties as a chief architect.  In my experience, there are just some things that you are only likely to have been exposed to during the course of education and related further exploration.<p>Ultimately it's a matter of what you want.  Do you want paper?  What if the paper can increase your lifetime earning potential (do you care)?  What if you are so good that you can do better without the degree slowing you down?  If you were 1st or 2nd year, I'd say switch majors.  At 4 years... I'd say go with your gut.  If you're guts are wrong, at least you went with what you thought was right, and not what others thought.",1290514357

It's only a few lines.<p>(Mathematically expert readers will be able to solve both these problems rigorously and quickly without simulating.

6428591,comment,6424939,6426426,1,0,Klinky,,,"What with the low cost of cellphone service and the high cost of raising a child, I find it hard to believe that parents don&#x27;t at least equip their child with a feature phone that allows voice and text. It allows you to:<p>A) Check in at will with your child.
B) Have them communicate if they missed a bus or are getting a ride home with a friend.
C) Tell you they messed up and are out after dark with friends on the wrong side of town and really need a ride home.<p>Those factors alone seem to outweigh the negatives to me.<p>As far as phones and school, it just sounds like cellphones are the new scourge being blamed for things the previous generation doesn&#x27;t like or understand, just like music, RPGs, TV, and video games were.<p>Kids can be cruel, but calling the understanding of technology and social networking in the 21st century &quot;stupid&quot; seems shortsighted.

6428571,comment,6424280,6427091,2,0,dalke,,,">  You invoked the legal definition of culpability<p>I invoked culpability. There a legal definition, yes, but there&#x27;s also a moral meaning. I meant to include both, and not limit it to legal.<p>> TFA doesn&#x27;t invoke that argument, because that would change the focus to individual trainers rather than CrossFit as an organization<p>Why would it?<p>You need only look at the history of consumer protection laws to see counter-examples. Consider the classic &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;. It covers many examples where automotive manufacturers know that certain practices were unsafe, but did not change them, for various reasons. Some were considered unimportant and ignored, others were &quot;too expensive&quot;, or bad user interface design, or putting design over engineering.<p>One chapter was even about how drivers were considered to be the only ones to blame for accidents and injuries. But the manufacturer, more than the car dealer, must share culpability.<p>I do not believe that what the car companies were doing was illegal, so they were not legally culpable. They certainly were morally culpable, and we passed laws to make those practices be illegal. Now we have much, much safer cars than in the 1950s.<p>You see this pattern in other consumer protection laws, like in the pharmaceutical industry. If a drug has known serious side-effects, but the company decides to hide it, or doesn&#x27;t have the systems set up to handle reports about side-effects, then it&#x27;s the company which is most culpable, and not the doctor who prescribed the drug.<p>Sound familiar?<p>Culpability can be shared. I have no problems saying that the person exercising, the trainer, and the organization who licenses the name and training style, may have shared culpability. Even if it isn&#x27;t illegal.<p>> that&#x27;s why gyms have you sign waivers. The waiver informs you in no uncertain terms that this stuff is dangerous.<p>Ahh, so the car companies should have required people to sign a paper saying &quot;driving is dangerous. I accept all responsibility&quot;, and not been forced to change a thing. Great solution!<p>Three states don&#x27;t allow liability waivers. Does this mean that CrossFit or any other sports can&#x27;t exist in those three states? (Since Montana, Louisiana, and Vermont have sports clubs, I conclude the answer is &quot;no.&quot;)<p>I don&#x27;t think you understand how the law regards liability. Shark attacks are an inherent risk in surfing. Getting hit by a baseball is an inherent risk in playing baseball.<p>But some things are not inherent risks. If a coach forces the surf team to hit the waves when there&#x27;s been a shark report, and someone gets attacked by a shark, then that&#x27;s not an inherent risk. (Eg, once while at the beach the life guards called us out of the water because a helicopter flying by saw a shark in the water.)<p>Let&#x27;s look at concussion. More people have had concussions than rhabdomyolysis, so it&#x27;s easier to find information about it.<p>See for example, &quot;new research suggests that the medical staffs responsible for protecting college athletes often don&#x27;t have the authority to do so.&quot; ( <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Trainers-Butt-Heads-With/141333/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/article/Trainers-Butt-Heads-With/141333...</a> ), which will likely affect an NCAA class-action concussion lawsuit <a href=""http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/jeremy-fowler/23630356/ncaa-concussion-lawsuit-growing-plaintiff-list-schools-brace-for-scope-of-issue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/jeremy-fowle...</a><p>Or there&#x27;s the tentative NFL settlement, where &quot;The NFL has agreed to spend close to $800 million to diagnose and compensate potentially thousands of retired players who develop dementia and other brain disorders they blame on the violent, bone-crunching collisions that pro football has long celebrated in its highlight reels.&quot;<p>Or the new lawsuit by four ex-NFL players suing &quot;the league and its helmet maker, claiming they hid information about the dangers of brain injury.&quot; <a href=""http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000237961/article/four-exnfl-players-file-new-concussion-lawsuit-against-league"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000237961/article/four-...</a><p>You want to bet that they signed liability waivers?<p>Thus, we see that people who are engaged in sports, where there&#x27;s of course an inherent risk of danger, and where they have signed liability waivers, can still reasonably sue because of other reasons.<p>And the reason - I am not a lawyer - is likely because at some point it&#x27;s <i>not</i> an inherent risk, like you think it is, but caused by negligence or even gross and criminal negligence.<p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s supposed to happen in a case like this. (In my optimistic world.) CrossFit-the-organization has now heard that there might be a problem. They gather information about the rates of rhabdomyolysis and other severe training problems, while also working to ensure that this purported issue is either not real, or to realize that it is an issue and work to reduce it.<p>Failure to do so is, in my non-lawyer, pro-consumer viewpoint, gross negligence and therefore not subject to liability waivers, because that information should be available in order for people to make an informed decision.<p>> TFA was nothing but anecdotes<p>More correctly, it&#x27;s epidemological evidence that may or may not indicate a deeper persistent risk. Others have written about the same topic. It appears widely understood that some members view vomiting during a workout as a &#x27;badge of honor&#x27;, as <a href=""http://health.yahoo.net/articles/fitness/inside-cult-crossfit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.yahoo.net/articles/fitness/inside-cult-crossfi...</a> says. This doesn&#x27;t sound like simple friend-of-a-friend hearsay.<p>Given persistent &quot;anecdotes&quot; as you call it, coming from what appears to be non-correlated sources, means it&#x27;s worth investigating. Just like early reports of Pinto rear-end accidents, or of the fatal side-effects of fenfluramine/phentermine, lead to changes. And lawsuits.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that early reports are necessarily correct, or even presumptively correct. My point is that <i>if</i> it&#x27;s correct, then 1) culpability doesn&#x27;t have to lie only in the person exercising, but also in the trainer and/or the organization, and 2) failure to investigate and possibly rectify this possibility is (or at least should be) negligence in its own right.<p>Your argument point seem to be that 1) it isn&#x27;t correct and 2) there are plenty of benefits and must be included. Those are both good points, but only related to the point I was making.<p>> In my case I got stronger and more fit.<p>Congratulations. For me it was dancing. About 25 hours per week at my peak, and over the years including salsa, swing, Scottish country dance, Swedish folk dance, Argentinian tango, modern dance, and flamenco.<p>> I (and many others) believe that the rewards are more than worth the risk<p>Your logic cannot be used as the basis for a good sense of morality. For one, you haven&#x27;t established that these are on the same balance scale.<p><i>If</i> there is a systemic problem with the current CrossFit training method then it might be that a small change leads to a 50x reduction in rhabdomyolysis rates while not affecting the benefits for people like you. Double-plus-good!<p>For another, if known risks have been deliberately concealed from you, then you cannot make a proper risk/reward judgement.<p>And as you pointed out, your observations are subject to survivor bias.",1379893765

Is that your assertion?<p>I still do not get it.  It seems to me that US carriers subsidize the phone hardware because US consumers have an irrational unwillingness to pay the full price of the hardware -- or an irrational willingness to pay monthly contractually obligated payments to carriers.<p>If that is true, then there I see no reason for US carriers to fear the availability of high-end phones at full price -- even if that price is not &quot;artificially&quot; high -- since US consumers have an irrational aversion to paying full price.  So why would US carriers pressure manufactures to keep high-end phone prices high (in the US or in other countries)?<p>ADDED.  I agree with you that Apple is able to keep the price of the iPhone a lot higher than their cost to make iPhones.

6428566,comment,6427194,6427194,1,0,al2o3cr,,,"Interesting idea. Some notes / comments / questions on the posted code (in no particular order):<p>* setting up a separate routing namespace for the API would clean up a number of things. In particular, it would make the web-only actions much clearer; calling respond_with with a JSON error payload and then relying on it to render the template (as done in OnionsController#index, for instance) is terribly confusing on a first read.<p>* does logging in actually set session[:UserKey]? It doesn&#x27;t appear to, but that would make returning users unable to decrypt their existing onions.<p>* I really, really hope that isn&#x27;t your actual session secret in config/initializers/secret_token.rb. More info on why this is bad and how to fix it here: <a href=""http://blog.phusion.nl/2013/01/04/securing-the-rails-session-secret/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.phusion.nl/2013/01/04/securing-the-rails-session...</a><p>* The encryption code in OnionsController would be better suited in the Onion model, especially since the decryption code is already there.<p>* the API for adding onions (OnionsController#addOnion) does not encrypt the data before storing it. Is this intentional?<p>* every action that modifies onions creates a new session. From the way that new_session works, I&#x27;m guessing this is to provide &quot;session expiration&quot; that&#x27;s reset every time a user changes something. Would updating the timestamp on the user&#x27;s existing Session accomplish the same thing, or have I missed something?<p>Some more code-review oriented notes:<p>* Some of your class methods in the models would be clearer as instance methods - for instance, both account_exists and pass_is_good take the hashed username as an argument and find the corresponding Account object. pass_is_good could be an instance method on Account. As another example, the code inside the loop in decrypted_onions_with_key could be an Onion instance method (telling an Onion object to decrypt itself vs. doing it externally).<p>* the comment character in Ruby is #, not surrounding things in / symbols (which creates a Regexp literal). In most cases (config/routes.rb, for instance) this happens to not cause problems - but it&#x27;s still not a good habit to get into.<p>* some style notes: none of these affect the operation of your program, but they <i>will</i> affect how efficiently other developers read your code and work with it.<p>First, pick a tab setting in your editor of choice and stick with it. The &quot;Ruby standard&quot; is 2 spaces, but if you prefer something else at least be consistent.<p>Second, check out some of the Ruby style guides regarding naming. CapitalizedCamelCase is makes for somewhat odd-looking database column names.",1379893660

Second it is not &quot;selling software&quot; that Stallman opposes, first order, but restrictions on freedoms of users to the end of selling software.  This should be apparent from the fact that Stallman himself (as is noted in the OP here) sold copies of EMACS back when copying was less trivial.  It&#x27;s certainly the case that triviality of mass copying plus the FSF&#x27;s &quot;freedom 2&quot; means that it is practically difficult to sell anything but the first copy (because people can simply get a copy elsewhere) but I&#x27;d argue that is precisely what Stallman is doing when consulting: selling that first copy.",1379893627

You might have a perfect product, but no buyers. Find the buyers, one at a time to start out. Your project has a lot to learn about, towards figuring out who would want to use it.

Amazon has been executing exceedingly well in this area but it&#x27;s not as though everyone else has been sitting on their ass. Over the next decades the sort of smart, high-tech, low latency fulfillment that we&#x27;ve come to associate with Amazon will be the worldwide standard anywhere and everywhere. Also look for infrastructural improvements along those lines. It used to be that people had visions of pneumatic tubes running everywhere. But consider some variations on that theme, a fully automated delivery system that could route standard sized containers across cities, continents, or maybe even the world. Maybe autonomous vehicles could play into that, but it seems as though building custom infrastructure would also provide a substantial RoI. Imagine how different the world would be if every housing structure had a 1m^3 &quot;mail box&quot; that you could receive packages in or send packages from which would immediately deliver them anywhere in the system 24/7 without human intervention. Economics changes a lot, consumerism changes a lot, industry changes a lot, and so on.<p>Fully automated manufacturing and configurable manufacturing. These may not replace all manufacturing but they seem likely to me to become a &quot;big deal&quot;, and people will make a lot of money off them. Imagine if you could go to a web page upload a bunch of plans (3D models, wiring diagrams, etc.) and place an order for a factory to manufacture something you&#x27;ve designed. This is more than just the home manufacturing (3D printing et al) revolution, it&#x27;s something on an entirely different scale. Imagine how this sort of thing would affect the cost of production of material goods. Imagine how it would affect the iteration speed as well. And think about how it would affect the mass production society we&#x27;ve grown accustomed to. What happens when a designer can produce a batch of a few hundred or a few thousand custom designed smartphones or what-have-you? Instead of everyone buying from a small pool of mass produced goods does the market change to focus more on boutique versions of such things? Do people start buying things that are more customized in functionality? What happens when you create factories that can effectively replicate themselves?<p>Education is slated to change dramatically over the next decades. Much of the world today lives in areas where formal education is not the norm. As those areas become developed there are education opportunities other than the traditional ones, especially when you consider the widespread abundance of computing devices in the future (see above). There is a huge market for learning software, on a multi-billion dollar per year scale, but a hell of a lot of work will have to go into creating all of that software to make it effective and practical.<p>Space will be big business too but that can be a bit hard to predict. Through the 21st century the cost of launching things into space will drop by at least a factor of 10 if not a factor of 100 or more. That will cause an exponential increase in the amount of stuff and people we put in orbit which will create substantial off-Earth economic activity which will gain momentum due to positive feedback effects. By 2100 I&#x27;d expect millions of people to be living off-Earth and trillions of dollars in revenue to be involved in off-Earth commerce and industry. This starts to get really interesting when you consider what sort of potential advantages building things in space might have. Obviously it makes it easier to test spacecraft, of course, since you have access to the environment they&#x27;ll operate in right there. But there are also some other interesting aspects. Vacuum is abundant and easy to get at. As is zero-g or nearly any level of g-forces you desire.

These design requirements forced them to design a shuttle with dimensions that were not optimized for the missions the shuttle ultimately carried out.<p>One of the problems with the ultimate design is that the Shuttle stack relied in part on the SSMEs to get into orbit.

They went so far to criticize agencies and senators and many other privately working corporations as control addicted, corrupt and inhuman moneybags. Senator Kinsey was exposed telling lies to the voters like: &quot;We do the best a christian can for our God blessed America&quot;, just to get their votes. Even though he seemed to believe what he said, the actions he made were all but &quot;christian&quot;. He willingly destroyed an entire solar system, just to test a bomb. The arrogant evil joy was truly revealing his real character. He was obviously an opportunist, who collaborated with evil aliens just to remain in power. And that last part sounds like our governments, who sell our data to other governments, when the price is right.<p>That&#x27;s why I really admired how this was the only series (except star-trek) where most stuff, contrary to most beliefs (imho) was a pure mix of fiction and actual ancient history. Although it was clear that Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill had strong prejudices against the Russian and communists in General (and russians always died first) he had deep respect to them as a Soldier. To me it looked like the authors tried to express some of their true thoughts, but were often forced to change or include parts into the script to reflect a more positive America, that really stood out.

Also not counting documentaries like &quot;Restrepo&quot;.<p>I hereby dispute the idea that the DOD has made it impossible for big-budget Hollywood movies to criticize the US military, and suggest instead that the bias Hollywood in favor of the military is responding to customer preferences and not leading it. Given what I presume to be America&#x27;s default position of &quot;supporting our troops&quot;, I&#x27;m struck by how many films Hollywood produce that <i>challenge</i> that default.<p>Remember also that Hollywood confronts at least two vectors of consumer preference in marketing films: first, Americans (in the large) have a (typical) diffuse nationalistic home-team support for our overseas adventures, and, more importantly, there&#x27;s a less-political less-issue-oriented reverence expected for the sacrifices made by the young people we send into combat which is especially intense during times when large numbers of people are serving in combat zones. In other words, it&#x27;s especially tricky to criticize the military during active conflicts.<p>Also, Three Kings is a fantastic movie.",1379891473

If you aren&#x27;t from DC then this probably sounds like nonsense, but you really can&#x27;t underestimate how big these bands are in the city, along with Junkyard Band, Backyard Band, and the Northeast Groovers.<p>For Chuck Brown, I see 21 songs. I have double albums of his with more songs than that. For Rare Essence, there are 17 songs, including a couple duplicates and a misattribution (&quot;One Leg Up&quot; is by Pure Elegance). BYB has 11 songs, NEG has 6, Junkyard has only one (!). These are very prolific bands that have produced tons of records sold in the DC area.<p>The thing is, nobody ever really &quot;pirated&quot; Go Go music, that is, put it on the internet.

They had a lot of very talented scientists and engineers and were certainly capable of coming up with many novel innovations on their own. However, within the communist soviet system politics ruled everything. Whether or not a project would receive support was utterly dependent on political factors, which could be affected by prior success of course, but not always. Soviet leadership put a heavy emphasis on espionage in guiding technological development, sometimes without much critical thinking. This goes back to the days of WWII spying on the Manhattan project and copying of captured B-29&#x27;s into the nearly identical Tu-4. But you see many other projects in the same vein, such as the Tu-144 (Concordski) and of course Buran.<p>The fascinating thing about Buran is that the Shuttle was built with a really very bizarre set of functional requirements that imposed steep demands on the design of the vehicle but which turned out to be mostly useless in a practical sense and were not actually meaningfully used during the lifetime of the vehicle. For example, the large wings on the Shuttle give it a very high cross-range flight capability during re-entry, but that was only a requirement because it was thought that the Shuttle would perform a particular kind of military mission. A polar launch which would deploy a satellite, or perform other activities, in one orbit and return to the launch site. Such missions never materialized, and such missions were unlikely to be valuable to the Soviets at all. And yet that requirement dictated the size of the wings which forced the frame to be larger and heavier, which reduced the payload, and which created a larger area that needed thermal protection (an issue which contributed to the loss of Columbia, for example), and so forth. A clean sheet design without such a requirement should have had much smaller wings and thus be a more capable and more reliable design, but Buran copied the Shuttle too closely and ended up with all of the faults of the Shuttle design without a good reason for them.",1379890835

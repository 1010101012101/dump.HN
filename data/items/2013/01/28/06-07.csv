This is a problem. The products we're building have huge, and usually unexamined, social consequences, and I don't think ignoring those consequences will work long term.<p>This is true in other fields that claim ""neutrality"" the way technologists do. Most working U.S. journalists, for instance, work for pro-government, pro-Capitalist news outlets. We call this ""objective"". Any deviation from that norm is ""bias"".<p>Keeping identifying information in a centralized location that is subject to subpoena by law enforcement is a norm now, too, one that has serious social consequences. So your decision to roll your own auth system and saying ""fuck it, I'll just make them log in through Facebook"" is about <i>a lot</i> more than how many keystrokes you have to enter and how much maintenance you're going to have to do down the road.<p>We should start factoring social consequences in to our technical decisions, like, ten years ago, and I'm afraid it's going to take a lynch mob empowered by Graph Search for people to get this.",1359356328

Whoa there, critical-thinking-by-the-numbers guy, maybe the article is also about fashion.<p>As a child, I considered style choices a silly and inconsequential distraction from the beautiful truths of the universe: e^(ipi) + 1 doesn't care what I'm wearing, so neither should I, therefore it doesn't matter, QED.<p>While today I still wish fashion would just go away so I could wear this conference t-shirt in peace, I contend it offers a reflection of who we are. Consider that while half the Senior Developers of the world can't program their way out of a FizzBuzz test, and half the world can't even read at all, <i>everyone</i> can look at someone's dress and decide if it's fashionable for their demographic. ""No, it offers a reflection of what the establishment wants us to be!"" I'll leave it to the reader to reconcile those two views. ""But I just care about finishing Project Euler problems in APL so I just decide to wear sandals and this old shirt like all my friends!"" <i>Fashion mattering doesn't depend on you caring.</i> Even you, APL-man, know Zuck couldn't wear his hoodie working for Quinn Emanuel unless he owned it (real question: how many people show up in suits at facebook?).<p>I was shopping for pretty scarves (!) with a product designer and suggested that ads are the clearest reflection of what a given demographic <i>is</i>. He agreed so quickly I wondered if I were late to the party. So when the Scientology ad in the Atlantic showed up, I thought of my favorite TLP quotation: if you're reading it, it's for you. The obvious question was ""why is the Atlantic publishing this!?"" The more depressing question is ""why am I in Scientology's target demo?""<p>Fashion is an advertisement about yourself. ""But the relationship is not always so obvious!"" Hence the hoodie the world's richest web geek refuses to remove. ""But I don't care what Zuckerberg wears!""

Hopefully cases like these will push companies to band together and not remain tight-lipped like they were on the Soverain case (until Newegg broke the chain).<p>There's a coalition for the open Internet, why not a coalition for fair innovation in technology?

""The district court's conclusion that a prima facie case of obviousness was not met is not explained by the court by Soverain, and does not accord with the record,"" the appellate panel ruled. ""[T]he trial record contains extensive testimony of the experts for both sides, discussing every claimed element of the patented subject matter and the prior art system.""</i><p>If I understand this right, Judge Davis simply ignored all Newegg's testimony about prior art and ruled that they hadn't even made a prima facie case for obviousness. Thankfully the Court of Appeals didn't think so. I wonder if Davis was simply leaving the issue of patent validity to a higher court to decide, or if he really had a good legal reason to ignore prior art and the evidence for obviousness. The Soverain lawyer's blogpost provides an inside view on the 2010 case: <a href=""http://mcsmith.blogs.com/eastern_district_of_texas/2010/08/jmol-rulings-in-soverain-v-newegg-damages-experts-future-royalties-jmol-standards-obviousness-etc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mcsmith.blogs.com/eastern_district_of_texas/2010/08/j...</a><p>In the end the jury's $2.5m award might not even have covered Soverain's legal costs, meaning that it wasn't a win for them either - more of a draw.<p>Reading the fresh Appeals opinion is interesting too: <a href=""http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/2011-1009.Opinion.1-17-2013.1.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/...</a><p><i>Precedent\nagrees with Newegg that a person of ordinary skill[2] could\nhave adapted the CompuServe order command to known\nbrowser capabilities when these capabilities became\ncommonplace, and that it was obvious to do so. The\nproduct identifier message term does not distinguish the\nshopping cart claims from the prior art CompuServe Mall.</i><p>Clearly sensible reasoning, not misled by technicalities and sophistry - I like it. The opinion is basically a no-nonsense slap-down of Soverain's arguments and Davis's ruling, which will no doubt restore your confidence in the justice system a little.

The simplest is the fact that if you consider all of the directions the wind might blow when you are standing next to a fire you are blocking the wind that would blow the wind directly away from you. This gives a slight bias toward the smoke being blown toward you when you stand near a fire.<p>However, when you are standing ""upwind"" of the fire you don't simply block the wind, you create a recirculation zone of turbulent air in front of you. If you are close enough to a fire then this recirculation zone will be able to suck in the smoke from the fire, towards you.<p>Additionally, the heat of a fire will create a convective flow, with air flowing upward (due to the heat) and being replaced from all sides laterally. So even if there is no wind there will still be a convective airflow which gives rise to that turbulent recirculation zone in between you and the fire.<p>Thus you have a situation where only in the case where there is a wind blowing substantially sideways relative to the line between you and the fire will the smoke not be attracted to you if you are close enough to the fire.<p>This can be avoided simply by standing far enough away from the fire to avoid these various effects.",1359355005

Then it's a matter of waiting to collect that data (if we're talking startups or smaller businesses).

I am from Germany and I would probably find it difficult to listen to myself in an English language podcast due to my accent.<p>What sounds familiar and what strange or plain wrong is probably highly personal. For example, I've heard enough Australians speak to have a feel for that particular variant of English. When I hear it, I notice the different ""melody"" of it, but there usually isn't a sound that surprises me or comes unexpected. It's like when I go into the Biotech building on our university campus: They have a weird floor layout and the main staircase isn't anywhere near the main door, but I find my way around because I got used to it.<p>However, when I had just moved to London as a freshman and first heard my Australian professor speak, every other word seemed out of place. That was just like my first trip to the Biotech building where the simple process of walking through the corridors was constantly interrupted by doors covered 100% in hazard signs and trying to remember the turns I took. Sure I could understand the Australian professor just like I could find my way around the Biotech building back then. But it took more energy than listening to a well produced radio program or walking around the building I work in every day.<p>In a podcast, ideally you'd want a speaker whose voice sounds natural and familiar so that their words convert into thoughts effortlessly, yet there are so many different ways to speak. This is a problem you have to deal with as a podcast producer that writers rarely have (except when writing about aluminum/aluminium).",1359354839

Today's muslims are also different than muslims who lived 300 or 500 years ago. The political systems they lived under were completely different than the ones of today, as well as economic system. Judging a religion by its followers and by context of the time is a very misleading thing. Muslim rulers of Moorish Spain is very different than the Taliban of Afghanistan. Former lasted for 781 years and the latter lasted maybe just 30 years and there's a lot of controversy on the latter.<p>How would you compare Mexican and Danish people. Both overwhelmingly Christian, but is it fair to compare these two nations? Which one would ""sample"" Christian population best? How about Danish of 400 years ago vs. of today? Unfortunately when I hear Mexico the first thing comes to my minds is Cartel. Anyway you got the point.<p>2. There's nothing in Islam that prohibits scientific research, only those who interpret it interpret within their own level of understanding and especially according to their interest. In a society there are a lot of interest groups and they twist the reality and truth for their own benefit. For example it took very long for printing machine to be used in Ottoman territories and the people who objected those machines used arguments they fabricated abusing the religious understanding. However the reason behind it was purely economical. At that time there was a huge industry of ""copiers"" whose sole bread winner was duplicating documents by hand and they had good ties with the Court of Sultan. Of course they could not turn around and say we don't want this because it will take away our monopoly but they fabricated all kinds of excuses to have it banned.<p>3. For a country to have any progress there has to be (relatively good) rule of law in that country. Most of the Muslim countries of today lack rule of law, most are artificial governments (supported by big boys, take Saudis, a client state of USA). This is a long subject so I just want to give a link. Long story short, if you can not build a strong legitimate political system everything else fails, and this has been the case for Muslim countries for the last 300 years.

I'd say off the top your communication overhead is 50%, so lets say you now have 100 programmers available to program, and 100 to communicate. Now to use these 100 programmers effectively you need them to work in parallel, in any project you usually have layers so some programmers simply won't be able to do anything because they are waiting for someone else, lets say outside of meetings these programmers are actually programming 75% of the time, now you have 75 programmers.

Jonathan is completely correct in that it's a much worse experience because it doesn't easily give you the information you need to consume in order to find the problem you're looking to solve. Using the text user interface helps considerably but it still gets in the way. Sure, seeing source is fine, but what if you want disassembly too? Mixed source/assembly? Register view? Watches? Switching between threads easily? Viewing memory? DDD is an improvement but it still feels like it's 8 years behind. I'm glad to hear you're productive in that environment, most people (especially most game developers) aren't, and based on my experience getting people up to speed and fixing problems it's easier to get them going on Windows than on Linux.<p>That said, it's not the worst though.

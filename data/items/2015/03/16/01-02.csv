I struggled at first (with my daughter&#x27;s performance in a recent science fair), but realized that my experience was a gift I could give to her in the form of a better-than-average ability to explain seemingly complicated ideas to an 8 year old.  And to provide somewhat expert guidance on the scientific method itself.<p>To a certain extent, this happens in many other ways at schools as well.  I mean, those kids with very athletic, or sports oriented, parents, may be more driven or have better guidance in athletic endeavors that would my kids.  But we seem not to care about that (until the parents are screaming during a game).<p>And likewise with music, or art, and so on.  So I think I&#x27;ve decided not to get too concerned about how others might view my daughter&#x27;s work on her project.  It would be unfair (to her) if I decided <i>not</i> to give her explanations that were the benefit of my own experience.",1426471164

Does rent control in SF or the US in general not stipulate that rent control is also a function of the tenant&#x27;s ability to pay? Here, in The Netherlands, this is an important criterion in determining what the maximum increase is in rent for a given property [1].<p>My general understanding of the law in The Netherlands based on having rented once during university is that it heavily favours tenants. The bottomline is that no one is allowed to end up on the street, with the main exception being if the landlord is in dire financial straits. Apart from that, the law sides with the tenant. This even goes to the extent that fixed-term contracts are more or less useless, because if a tenant doesn&#x27;t want to leave, they don&#x27;t have to.<p>Is it considered reasonable in SF that the tenant will be able to find alternative accommodation within 60 days?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/huurwoning/huurverhoging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/huurwoning/huurverho...</a> (Laws on rental increase in The Netherlands in Dutch)<p>[2] <a href=""https://www.jurofoon.nl/huren/huurovereenkomst-voor-bepaalde-tijd.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jurofoon.nl/huren/huurovereenkomst-voor-bepaalde...</a> (Fixed-term contract rules for housing in Dutch)",1426470884

However, the issue with the naive method is loss of accuracy, not bias.  When the article states<p><i>If k is 64, a natural choice for the source of bits, then because the set {0, 1, ..., 2^53 - 1} is represented exactly, whereas many subsets of {2^53, 2^53 + 1, ..., 2^64 - 1} are rounded to common floating-point numbers, outputs in [0, 2^-11) are underrepresented.</i><p>this is very misleading, because the points that are &quot;underrepresented&quot; are closer together.  The discrete probability density created by the naive method is a perfectly good approximation to the uniform distribution.<p>Furthermore, although as the article shows, we can do better, this can, and must, come at a cost.  Since the small numbers occur with much lower probability, the only way to generate them (without importance sampling) is by generating much more randomness (1088 bits in the article).  Generating random bits is expensive, and this uses 17 times more randomness than the naive method.<p>EDIT: it would be possible to avoid generating all the extra bits in most cases, and so an efficient average time algorithm should be possible, but the worst case still requires 1088 bits to be generated.",1426470547

Wonder if that&#x27;s been tried anywhere?<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with the history of SF&#x27;s rent-control laws, but in Copenhagen another motivation is stability, though. Beyond simply the hassle of moving, there was a decision some decades ago (probably about a century at this point) that it should be possible for people to choose to live somewhere long-term, organize their life around that assumption, customize the space within reason, etc., and not worry that they will be forced to move constantly because of fickle landlords and markets. Rent-control laws and anti-eviction laws (which aren&#x27;t quite the same, since a landlord might want to evict for reasons unrelated to rental prices) aimed at that stability, so a tenant who has lived in a place for at least 3 years generally has something like &quot;tenure&quot; in the place, protected against both rent increases and eviction.<p>Now you might say: if you want that kind of stability, you should buy rather than rent. But at least here, the concept of individually owned condos didn&#x27;t exist until recently. Real-estate was a system of land ownership, along with any improvements on the land. So you could own some land with a house on it, or some land with a 5-story apartment building on it, but you couldn&#x27;t own only the left half of the 4th floor of a building. You could rent <i>use</i> of that portion of the building, but you couldn&#x27;t <i>own</i> a floating piece of the building. (Condo ownership now exists, but it really is an odd kind of real estate, since it comes with no land, and your unit is so heavily structurally coupled to neighboring units, that normal decisions regarding real estate, like choosing to build or demolish structures, can&#x27;t really be exercised.)<p>Obviously your average worker couldn&#x27;t buy an entire apartment building, so almost all of the urban working class rented. This system of rental stability was then developed to provide housing stability for them. (There are alternatives also in use, which arguably work better. The two main ones are cooperatively-structured housing, where residents jointly own their own building through a system of shares; and association-owned housing, where an organization such as a union or philanthropic society owns housing and rents it to their members, or to the public, on generally favorable terms.)",1426470166

Talk out loud, the way you will in the interviews.

Then you don&#x27;t have to deal with the fat, half dried out stuff you encounter during the interview.

It reduces the incentives for landlords to maintain properties (the OP specifically cites these problems) and makes it difficult-to-impossible for people in rent-controlled units to move (again, cited by the OP).  It also significantly reduces the supply of housing in SF, driving up market-rate rents.  Eventually the market-rate rents are so much higher than the rent-controlled rents that landlords have a strong incentive to pull stunts like what&#x27;s happening here.<p>The other big part of the problem is that so many people seem to think that the solution to all their economic problems is more regulation.

I would argue that the fairer thing (when Rent Control is in place) for owners might be that they can discontinue the contract when it expires but they also forfeit the right to rent that unit for a period of time (like 6 mo or 1 yr).  Owners have some right to reclaim the property for own use but then are discouraged from flipping the unit and just reusing it the same way with different people.<p>When I rented in Boston from operating companies, they always increased rent the maximum allowed every opportunity allowed.  This encouraged a lot of churn in the area I lived which I don&#x27;t think was good for the area.  I also had a lot of problems with them never fixing appliances so I moved out.

I was very proud of her work/effort, and wanted to share that with friends/family, but many of the reactions were, essentially, &quot;well, it was really you who won&quot;.  And that couldn&#x27;t be further from truth.<p>Now, one reason, I assume for this reaction, is due to two things: 1) they know I&#x27;m science nerd (I have a degree in physics), and 2) she&#x27;s really young, but won for the whole school (she&#x27;s in the second grade, and won 1st place for the school, and her own grade).  They say this, without even knowing what she did or how she did it.  To me, the entire point of the fair is to get kids AND parents involved in science, while exposing kids to the scientific process.  So, to me, I get my daughter to do as much of her project as she can.  And even things she can&#x27;t do, I still get her to try, even when it takes her a long time (like typing her slides that get glued to her board - she types with one finger pecking very slowly).  But she loved the work, and felt like she was learning something.  Her experiment was incredibly simple (literally a cup of water and a timer), and she thought of the procedure herself, and the question she wanted to answer was hers.<p>But, even after I explain this to someone, they still feel my daughter was unfairly advantaged, or at the very least, was given some better than average coaching, because of my background/experience.  To a certain extent, I kind of agree on that point.  I do try really hard to explain the concepts to her in a way that an 8 year old can understand.  But, ultimately, it all comes down to her.  The idea and experiment were hers.<p>When I walked the gym and saw the other experiments/projects, many were highly decorated and beautiful (my daughter&#x27;s had no decoration, just a title and the required sections with text in her own words).  And many experiments had rather elaborate processes, and/or complex devices.  Sadly, I too thought that many parents were at work, rather than the kids, even knowing how much I made my daughter do on her own.  But it all seems to come down to the kids.  And, some here have mentioned, the judges are pretty good at detecting BS.  So although a perusal of the fair wouldn&#x27;t make it obvious which kids did their own work, or how much they really learned, and that&#x27;s where the assessment of the judges has to be taken into account.<p>And it was that that made me feel better about my daughter&#x27;s work.  I was proud of her, because I knew that it was she who did it, and was glad the judges were able to see it.  But I totally know that many parents do over-involve themselves to the point the kids don&#x27;t learn anything.  It seems a difficult balance to strike, but it does seem possible to distinguish the extremes.",1426468456

I would much rather look at the way the product is made and the shaping market does than the producer of the goods. Personal opinion:<p>United States: Schools are just educational facilities (Not learning moral values). Not enough time outside (No social interactions). Parents do not have the time to pass moral values to the kids. Parents make up for the lack of time/parenting with material things(Mainly electronics). Kids are spoiled. Different life-work structure and tougher time schedules for the parents and the kids(less time with kids/parents). Parents are more selfish (parents, do not get mad at me for saying this, I will provide an example later). Everything requires a car. Internet/TV are creating a bad atmosphere.<p>Eastern Europe: Schools are both disciplinary and educational facilities. Balanced time outside and inside. Sense of freedom given to the kid. Less &quot;rights&quot; given to the kid/parent. Balance of authorities, both parent and teacher/coach so that the kid understands that he cannot do whatever he pleases whenever he pleases.<p>I have noticed the differences in approaches to raising a child (I purposely wrote raising, as children are not only raised by their parents) in the United States and eastern European countries in the past 15 years.<p>I was born and raised in an eastern European country in times of war in the 90s and the NATO bombardment at the end of the same decade. I was only required to get into the house when the plane alarm was sounded that warned us of the possible danger. Even during those times I walked freely to the store, walked to school alone or with couple of friends, went and did my sport club activities and hang outside and played soccer. We went on school trips all the time, even during the summer for two or three weeks without parents. My parents wanted me to be outside rather than sitting in front of a computer, SEGA, Sony PS/PS2. From this I benefited a lot due to the fact that I stumbled upon liars, kids that were trouble and I had couple of fights - I am now realizing I was being prepared for the real world. When I had the time and if I wanted to watch TV, my cartoon choices were much &quot;healthier&quot;. As CN was introduced to our TV providers I&#x27;ve had the experience with Cow and Chicken and Dexter all of which were modern cartoons that had amazing graphics but had zero value in moral lessons. My coaches were also allowed to slap me, just like my teachers were. I received couple of slaps and they have taught me couple of valuable lessons. My parents were working hard and when they could not be next to me, my grandmother was taking care of me and not a babysitter, but I always walked alone to school and back and went to practices at night. My dad did however drove me back drove me back from practice at 10pm, and kids were then saying I was spoiled.<p>On the contrary - US children are given a lot more freedom - not necessarily by their parents but by the government. I have personally witnessed a woman being arrested in a mall because she slapped her child for being rude to someone in front of everyone. Also, parents are spoiling kids for no reason. &quot;Oh, Tim&#x27;s kid has a tablet? Well, I&#x27;m going to get my child one as well&quot; - even though he has no use for it and he already has 3 other consoles and a phone. They are using material stuff to make up for the lack of time spent with their kids. Do not get me wrong, I know it&#x27;s not their fault and I know that in a way they want the best for their kids. But in another way, they do equally care about themselves. Vacations without kids, lack of stress etc. I have not felt <i>real</i> <i>strong</i> connection between parents and kids in the US (I could be wrong). I have not had a chance to hear from any student I know that his/hers parents help them pay for college. Okay. Think for a minute. As you grow older, do you need more financial needs/luxuries or less? Why not help out your child not have any debts and invest in them so that they could invest in you once you go into retirement? Are they afraid their child will fail? (I&#x27;m talking about Middle-Size college, not Ivy league as I cannot testify since I do not attend one. I did however attend a top 10 boarding school in the US where money did not matter, and the kids on the lower budget were usually in the loans even then)<p>Also, in schools, teachers rarely raise voice or kick someone from the class. Kids that are not well disciplined keep managing to &quot;survive&quot; in class/school and generally bring everyone down. Everyone has to take the same test - sometimes you just have to use a hard test to teach kid a lesson.<p>My parents although really strict, did allow me to go out when I turned 14. Keep in mind, I could have bought liters upon liters of beer or dark liquor (drugs weren&#x27;t that popular then) and my parents knew that. However, they had belief that I would make the right choices and not get into trouble and be home by the curfew time, and due to the respect we had for them (I know it might not be polite, but I&#x27;m talking in the name of majority of my friends and kids of that time) we were back even earlier. Cops ID-ed me couple of times, they never once called in a social worker to question my parents why I was alone on the street at 11pm at the age of 13/14, or even when I was younger. I tried beer early, I never once got drunk until I was 19, and even then I had enough respect not to come home like that. Since I&#x27;m attending a US college I feel that every freshman here has never tried booze before so they get drunk and throw up ravioli all over my hallway, not just once, but repeatedly.Like it&#x27;s some sort of a blunt action, to prove that they can. Same goes for weed, which is just now becoming popular in my country.<p>One thing that I believe is positive - kids in the US start working earlier. That has a lot of advantages as most of the kids back in Eastern Europe rarely have any work experience or positive habits when it comes to work.<p>I do not want my child to be clueless about life, like some of my college friends. I do not want my child to go to an online high school and completely miss his social and character development. I do not want to drive him everywhere so that he could learn the city and have social interactions at the stores/parks/playgrounds/sport centers etc. I don&#x27;t want him to have only one friend that will stay over. I want him to have a chance to learn and understand life on his own and that I only guide him, not hold him on a leash.<p>PS it is pretty late so do not mind my rant, and I know that one college does not mean bad parenting is present across the US.",1426467907

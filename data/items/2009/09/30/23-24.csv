854005,story,,,47,21,chris_dickson,"Office space in NYC",,"Dear Hacker News community,<p>I recently co-founded a tech startup in NYC. My co-founder and I just rented some great space in soho and we're looking to turn it into a vibrant, thriving startup hub. Sorry if this is ad-like, but I feel like the benefit of this place to startups in New York outweighs the spaminess of the submission.<p>The space is an entire fully furnished loft that is currently divided up into bays that can easily fit 3 to 4 people each. The price is $875 for each 150 (actual) sq ft. bay. I've been looking around at prices for desk space in the city, and this package is definitely one of the best deals in NY. Great for startups because of the month to month lease and all inclusive amenities. My co-founder and I will also be working out of the space. Here are the details:<p>-Exact location is 447 Broadway (Broadway and Grand) in soho (supposedly ""Silicon Alley"") which is extremely close to the 1, 6, N, R, Q, W, J, M, Z subways\n-Each bay is 150 (actual) sq feet and are $875 each. There are two smaller bays at half of a full bay ($437.50)\n-Month to month lease. You would need to pay 1st and last month up front with 1 month security\n-Really cool soho loft with a great vibe, 16 ft. ceilings, 2 bathrooms, elevator access\n-All utilities (including free internet) included, free use of communal conference room\n-Great deli right down stairs that has everything, and great food close by (chinatown and little italy)\n-24 hour access\n-Free cleaning and trash removal 3 times per week\n-Use of kitchen with sink, microwave, fridge, tea/coffee<p>I think the benefits of this place go beyond the cost if we can fill it up with tech startups... it would have a great motivating community aspect that everyone would benefit from.<p>Please get in touch if interested and tell your friends!<p>Chris Dickson\ndickson@atmanetworks.com",1254355023

854000,comment,852198,853812,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Some methods of storing trees that I've seen:<p>You can store a tree using foreign keys for the children, but traversing the tree to level m requires m joins. Finding children at an arbitrary level requires O(tree depth) queries.<p>You can use preorder tree traversal which consists of mapping nodes to pairs of numbers representing intervals on the real line. Then ""x is descended from y"" is equivalent to ""x's interval is contained in y's interval"", and this at least lets you find the children of x. Going up a tree is harder. Inserting into the tree is tricky as well.<p>Another hack is to store on each node a string containing it's ancestors. I.e., ""/2/4/27/35"" indicates a node is descended can be reached from the root (node 2) by following the path 2->4->27->35. Then the regex search ""2/4/27/35/.*"" finds all children of node 35. This one is utter fail.<p>However, I freely admit I'm not a database expert. Is there some non-ugly solution I'm unaware of?",1254354878

853949,comment,853451,853664,0,0,geuis,,,"I agree wholeheartedly. However, there's a problem. To date, the only known physical system that has produced life is the one we are made of. To extend on that, we definitely have more knowledge now than before about the basic chemical interactions that make up many of the component molecules we're all built from. Despite this, we still haven't pieced together a bottom to top knowledge base of how you get from amino acids to dna/rna to functional, if simple, self-replicating systems.<p>In the last couple of years, advancements have been made in getting DNA and RNA to replicate independently in a test tube. Similarly, and more important, there have been at least a couple of experiments where completely synthetic RNA molecules (meaning manufactured and using amino acids not found in living creatures) have shown limited self-replication in test tube environments.<p>Other research efforts have been studying how certain collections of lipid (fat) molecules can form porous membranes, allowing some molecules to enter while blocking others. This is what our cell membranes do.<p>From the other direction, projects are in progress that are attempting to knock out all the un-necessary genes in a simple bacteria to create the simplest cell possible. Craig Venter is pretty far ahead on this. <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/craig_venter_is_on_the_verge_of_creating_synthetic_life.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/craig_venter_is_on_the_verge_of_cre...</a><p>As part of that project(I think) they have created a fully synthetic genome. The next part is to put it into an artificial cell and get it replicating.<p>So we have approaches from both the top and bottom that are seeking to meet in the middle.<p>I think the EvoGrid, if they are actually trying to simulate real biochemistry, is a very valid approach to help solve this problem. We're probably very close to understanding how to go from basic biochemistry all the way up. An artificial simulation that incorporates known physical properties might offer some additional insights on how this works.<p>My belief is that once we have a rough draft of a theory on how it all fits together that can be experimentally repeated, it will provide a firm starting point for figuring out the mathematics behind why it works. Think of it as being similar to the Standard Model of physics, but for life. Once we know one set of rules that works, then it opens up the way for experimenters to setup massive simulations with all different kinds of parameters to explore the full range of possibilities for life.<p>One very interesting extension of this idea is that once we know for sure how carbon-based life arises from the proverbial molecular soup, it lets us start experimenting with other elements. We can examine if its possible for life to arise in previously dismissed areas of the universe. We could determine how likely it is for silicon-based biochemistry to work. It also gives us the opportunity to engineer life using elements that really can never get together in the regular old universe due to natual laws.",1254352547

Most of these are vaguely generic domains or things that people are typing in because they assume there will be something useful on them. A well parked domain then directs them off to where they actually want to be (and makes some money in the process).<p>Don't forget, you only need to earn two cents per day to make a profit.",1254352491

Don't use theirs since it's unethical without permission, and even with permission, your employment contract might give them rights to your work.<p>2) Time. Just because you're in the office doesn't mean you are on their time, but if you are, then that's unethical too.<p>3) Space. If you've satisfied the first two conditions, it seems like little harm is done and little risk assumed by working on your own laptop on your own time while in the office.<p>Lastly, I'd worry more about network monitoring than keystroke loggers.

As a network consultant now, I find Perl to be immensely helpful, when it comes time to script some monitoring or automated activity.<p>That said, a fellow networker had mentioned that many others had been switching. Most of my days are not spent programming, but I do occasionally bust out a project or two. Is it worth my time to make the switch?",1392875992

And yes, I do believe Toyota did the recall as a PR effort. Take a look at what Audi did instead. They, correctly, stated there was nothing wrong with the cars and they took an insane PR hit and sales plummeted. There continues to be no actual evidence of unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles.<p>And I don&#x27;t think HNers are somehow less likely to hit the wrong pedal or refuse to admit it. There&#x27;s always that possibility that they don&#x27;t even know they hit the wrong pedal.",1392875979

Generally, it depends on the kind of connection activity and a bit on which operating system. Event based IO is simply pushing information that kernel schedulers already use into user space. The trade-offs really depend on where you need control the most.<p>Many kernels can do a pretty good job at general purpose networking but at this scale you tend to care about the details and so more of these systems tend to push the decision making to the program using APIs like epoll & kqueue (Linux and *BSD respectively). Keeping this information transfer cheap for millions of sockets is not as trivial as just using the API but it&#x27;s a necessary step to control overhead.<p>Whether your user space code uses threads in places to get work done is often misunderstood as well since thread doesn&#x27;t always mean a single logical thread in a program. Erlang, in SMP mode, uses threads to run it&#x27;s own process schedulers (much like an operating system). The operation of these schedulers is handled in such a way that IO can efficiently block a process and the scheduler can move onto other things in queue. So, in many ways, it&#x27;s the same ideas we had on the bare OS but with more specific implementation governed by Erlang&#x27;s philosophy.",1392874460

This is making some strong assumptions, but the first AI could probably improve itself. Making better AIs that make better AIs and so on. Very rapidly (possibly only hours, days, weeks) it could become much much smarter than humans. If that happens, than we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s possible, but it could probably do a lot of things we consider impossible. Like hack computer networks trivially and spread itself through the entire internet. Solve the protein folding problem and design working nanotech.<p>Within a week it could pay/blackmail/manipulate some humans somewhere into developing some crude self-replicating robots or nanotech. Then almost immediately afterwards it consumes the entire Earth in a swarm of rapidly self-replicating nanobots.<p>...or something. How should I know what a mind literally millions of times more intelligent than me would do. It&#x27;s like predicting the exact next move a chessmaster will make. I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m confident they&#x27;d beat me quickly.<p>The goal, of course, is to make an AI which <i>won&#x27;t</i> do this. If the AI decides to terminate the human race, we&#x27;ve already failed making it friendly and it obviously doesn&#x27;t share our goals and values. But what <i>are</i> our goals and values?

Jaynes would have said that you do this using your knowledge of the physics of coins and coin flipping. One of the examples he uses in his book <i>Probability Theory: The Logic of Science</i> is a robotic coin-flipper that can control the process so as to always make the coin land on the same side, i.e., the &quot;bias&quot; is in the flipping process, not in the coin itself. If you don&#x27;t know anything about the flipping process or the relevant physics, then you have no way of constructing any hypotheses about what sort of generative process might be involved.<p><i>It is far easier to just say &quot;empirically, biases seem to be distributed like so.&quot;</i><p>This corresponds to the case where you don&#x27;t know anything about the underlying physics; in Bayesian terms, you are assuming a maximum entropy prior with a constraint--the constraint being the distribution observed in the flips so far. But if you <i>do</i> know something about the underlying physics--for example, if you know the coin is being flipped by a robotic flipper with such-and-such design--you might be able to come up with a much better prior using that knowledge. I&#x27;m not sure whether that sort of thing is included in the frequentist&#x27;s concept of a &quot;generative model&quot;.",1392872732

Presumably they could rent the antenna and the cable to them instead of selling it. So at what point does it cross the line into a service that is illegal? When they use a signal booster? When they convert it to a digital signal? When my neighbor signs up too and they use a common cable along the way?<p>I suspect the real problem is that the tech has just changed too much; at some point original intent stops making sense when the circumstances change enough. If we had a well-run legislative branch, presumably they would have noticed this problem a few years back and patched it. Or they would have delegated the problem to a regulator whose job it was to keep on top of things. But that&#x27;s not the world we live in.",1392872708

814847,comment,814161,814223,0,0,chris11,,,"I agree with you in that consciousness does really see ill defined. But I don't think that would stop a computer program from achieving consciousness.<p>Even with consciousness being so ill defined I'd say that there are a few points that we can agree on. For one, even if peoples definitions and expectations of consciousness differ, we can all find examples of life that we agree are conscious.<p>The boundary may be really fuzzy. We might disagree whether animals are conscious or brain-dead/comatose are conscious. But we could probably find a case that we agreed on.<p>And once we assume that I would ask you whether a computer program would ever be able to pass the Turing test and convince us that it was conscious. If a computer program would be able to pass I'd argue that it was conscious, since consciousness seems to me to be totally subjectively defined.<p>If you say that a program would not be able to pass, I might agree with you intuitively, but I would question it intellectually. Because I've always believed that there are cases that are definitely perceived as conscious by other people. I would be shocked if someone truly believed that the person next to me is somehow not conscious. So the next question I would ask is whether consciousness resides and arises from something that can be explained scientifically. Or to put it simply: Can we describe,now or in the future, the workings of the brain? If so, I really don't think we would need a scientific explanation for any epiphenomenon
such as consciousness, all we would need to is recreate those initial conditions and we should be able to mimic consciousness.<p>If you say that we won't be able to mimic the workings of the human brain I'd simply say that you are making the statement that there is physical phenomena that can never ever be explained by science.<p>If you say that even if we recreate a human brain, we will never mimic consciousness, then I'd reply that you are saying that my personal definition of consciousness not affected and defined by other peoples definition of consciousness.<p>I think that might be why you see an inconsistency between attributing a special meaning to consciousness and and religion. We instinctively act like the human race can find common ground on the definition of consciousness. We don't instinctively act like we can find common ground on religious beliefs.",1252568445

Six filters were used to sample narrow wavelength ranges. The color results from assigning different hues (colors) to each monochromatic image. In this case, the assigned colors are:</i><p>I hope this has some scientific value but I'm suspicious that it has much more of a public relations value.  This strikes me as completely dishonest.

814834,comment,813306,813571,0,0,yason,,,"For what I've read salt is a commonly used term in cryptology, and refers to certain schemes for key derivation for hashing/encrypting. Salt can either be public (to make brute-force attacks infeasible) or private (for better security).<p>Almost always when pickling we're only interested in one aspect of security that is integrity: what we put in is what we get out. Encryption isn't needed and signing doesn't really offer much more with regard to this case. Instead, cross-checking against a message digest to make it hard to modify pickles (or any runtime data offloaded to disk) seems to be almost idiomatic. YMMV.<p>Not that I wouldn't want to write a fancy GPG based persistent storage but generally it would be an overkill. And overkills, in my experience, are good at blinding the developers from other threats. YMMV.<p>There are many good, proven message digest algorithms that are useful for implementing a simple salted hashing scheme. In practice, an application developer must eventually take algorithms for granted. We consider MD5 demonstrably weak but SHA, especially variations with longer digests, we consider strong enough for most purposes. So given the assumption that we can trust SHA, I'm sure you're familiar with something like the following:<p>- take the pickle output from pickle.dumps()<p>- create some random data and use it as salt<p>- run the pickle output + salt through hashlib.sha512() or whichever you prefer to obtain the message digest<p>- store the pickle output somewhere, even in public<p>- store the message digest somewhere, even in public<p>- store the salt some place safe<p>- recompute and verify before calling pickle.loads()<p>You still have to have trust in some storage that you consider safe. Computing the salt dynamically from a set of fixed and/or runtime values could be done by anyone, and is merely security by obscurity. However, exactly the same applies to GPG: you would have to store the private and public keys somewhere safe, and go from there.<p>And finally, as for me, I'd probably create more security holes in implementing the GPG integration than just sticking with the standard Python hashlib.",1252566858

814830,comment,814744,814744,0,0,desiderata,,,"Another intentionally crippled API in Android wouldn't exactly be surprising. I run into them all the time as a developer.<p>The initial SDKs had an awesome XMPP implementation that made communicating with programs on other phones incredibly easy. A program could even be started remotely to add a status bar notification that someone is challenging you in a multiplayer game you both have installed, for example. Now there's no public XMPP API at all and you have to include a less integrated Smack API JAR provided by the community. This uses up a lot of the very small amount of data storage space for installing applications and requires you to query the user for user and password information the phone already has anyway. Needless to say the issue thread for this is full of developers complaining and detailing how badly it impacts them and Google doesn't care.<p>Similarly, earlier versions of Android exposed some great APIs for searching for nearby businesses. For example, you could find all pizza places near the user and do something cool with that information in your application. The classes that allowed this were com.google.googlenav.Search and com.google.android.location.GmmGeocoder, but are now inaccesibe. The public GeoCoder class is useless for this. Developers are forced to call the Maps web service, handle all the potential problems and resource issues of opening HTTP connections, and parse XML results when this functionality is already completely written, just no longer exposed. The built in Maps application does this, so Google probably wants to prevent developers from being able to do the same easily.<p>I suppose it is a lot like how Apple rejects apps that ""duplicate functionality"". Google is trying to cripple third party developers in the same manner, they just do it at the API level.",1252566693

Plus, <i>cough</i>, trackable <i>cough</i> split testable <i>cough</i>.  (Incidentally, if you had a landing page, you wouldn't be showing me AdSense ads featuring a very bright background and a cute little Asian kid with glasses, and another ad telling me how easy it is to get a green card.  I suppose it could be worse -- you could be showing me Evony ads.  Either way, cute little Asian kids with glasses sort of distract from the general theme of <i>saving people from horrible death</i> that I was going for.)<p>2)  Repeat after me: Stormpulse saves lives and property.  Stormpulse saves lives and property.  Stormpulse saves lives and property.  After you've mentioned that a few times, you can talk about weather visualization.  This is not being crass, any more than it is crass for an airbag manufacturer to say ""Our product directly saved the lives of 12,000 people last year"".  It is your <i>reason for being</i>.  Do not be afraid to sell it.<p>3)  I'm sure you and Brad are wonderful people and you likely did wonderful things at your previous jobs, but look, you've got the Fortune 100 eating out of the palm of your hand to protect their lives and property.  That is the critically important qualification.  Next to that, ""We built a cool CMS once"" sounds like ""And by the way, my mother really loved the drawings I made when I was six"".<p>P.S. If I wanted to show that I was not faceless corporate, I would start the letter with an arresting sentence like so:<p>Severe weather kills people and breaks things.<p>A sentence like that grabs the reader by the neck.  Some people might say its a bit aggressive.  By my lights, heck yes, it is aggressive.

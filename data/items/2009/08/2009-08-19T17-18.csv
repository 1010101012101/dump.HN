Data would be distributed more widely by passing through several intermediaries:  Bob copies all of Alice's data, then Carol copies Bob's, and now Carol has Alice's data without necessarily having met.

I realize that wasn't the intent of this exercise, but given the recent number of ""how I don't waste money on food"" articles, I think it needs to be said.<p>The benefit you get from good food (which doesn't even have to be all that expensive) far outweighs whatever money I spend on it. Food is the only thing in my life that I do not set a firm budget for. I eat what I want, when I want, because food lends a richness to my life that no amount of cable TV or internet news trolling can equal.<p>To extend beyond this point a bit: of all the things that people really need to get rid of, it's cars. I recently moved to a new city and wondered if it was really time I got a car - nothing fancy, just your average middle-class sedan. Turns out between ownership cost, insurance, and gas, the car would be chewing up $15-20K per year (more likely $20K than $15).<p>And for what? So I can sit on a clogged freeway, gas-brake-honk my way to work every day, and repeat in the evening? No thanks.<p>Instead I paid a bit extra (couple hundred bucks a month) to live in a denser area with great transit coverage.

""Without this international collaboration SMS would not have become a global success story"", says Makkonen.<p>Mr Makkonen, did not receive financial payback for his pioneering work because he didn't apply for a patent. ""At that time there was an open sharing of ideas by monopoly operators so we never even considered to write a patent application"" said Makkonen.

My idea is pretty simple; make the language accommodate that. 
For ex.:

becomes

(link goes here.)<p>Your Drop Box includes your own Secretary who Files and Photocopies Every Document You Make or Edit, So You Can See What Each Document Looked Like Yesterday, Two Days Ago, or at Any Point In Time.  Did I Mention the Secretary and the File Cabinet are Fire-Proof and Wireless?<p>But, it's all digital.  And, it's secure.  And it's built to work between as many Windows desktops or laptop computer you use at NO EXTRA COST!  See for yourself! (another link to the download.)<p>Or, access your files at work from a web-based interface!  It's so flexible!<p>Q: Do I have to change how I work?<p>A: Absolutely not.  Any file and folder (Word documents, spreadsheets, family photos, etc) you add to your Drop Box folder is automatically synchronized and saved remotely.<p>Q: What is the Drop Box folder?<p>A: It's just a special folder which will appear on your computer.  Anything added to it is automatically saved, synchronized, and ""dated"" so you can go back in time!<p>Try it now!

9151,comment,8863,9081,0,0,vlad,,,"+1 on being able to specify a folder inside the dropbox as a ""server"" folder, which means it has it's own ftp address, user, and password settings.  Anything dragged there is automatically synched with that account.  I thought of this as well as soon as I read that post about Linux support, as this would work with shared hosting without expecting hosts to install dropbox on their linux boxes.  And the data would be backed up as well automatically in a third place (the drop box.)  And, you'd have access to retrieve an older version of a file.  This basically replaces the need for FTP clients if you also add a way to chmod the folders inside the ""server"" folder.  Sam is 100% right.",1175773316
9150,comment,8804,8804,0,0,dageroth,,,"I don't think that a central authority is necessary for money to work, at least not in form of a monopolist. Actually the current systems are rather unsatisfying because a state can loose its credibility and thus the trust in its curreny quite fast, basically as soon as war looms on the horizon or it becomes apparent that it will default on its debt. In the last 25 years over 87 currencies crashed.
And because of the monopoly of the state on money the whole economy is usually going down along. For my part I would therefore abandon the monetary monopoly of the state and allow competition, allow companies to issue money. When they connect their name to the currency and have no legal power to make their money legal tender they will have a much stronger incentive to provide a good and stable money. Hayek wrote a fascinating treatise on the denationalisation of money, and with the ongoing globalisation sooner or later we will get used to juggle with more than one currency in our pockets. Second Life seems to be a step in the direction that companies start to issue private currencies and when states, especially in the developing countries, will fail to keep their currency stable chances are that they will be replaced by private currencies. <p>Equally interesting and probably easier to believe are gold backed currencies with competing private institutes issuing goldbacked money.<p>Still, its great to see people thinking about money in another way than just how to get it.

9147,comment,9126,9142,0,0,vlad,,,"I love the paragraph stating the upcoming introduction of Java into Netscape will help the server generate the stores on a user's screen.  Every programmer who've seen it, including Paul, must have laughed at that line later on.  ""Client-side Java taking load off the server?  That's silly!""  I believe Paul himself has said, in one of his other articles, that some startups failed during the dot com boom simply because they tried to create their businesses using Java.<p>That is, until last year.  With the JavaScript (AJAX) technology saving CPU server cycles[1] by doing a lot of logic in the web browser itself, Paul's one paragraph predicting something he expected to occur within a few months now sounds way ahead of its time.  Either that, or such technology has taken 10 years too long to brew.  (Coffee reference!)<p>I would also like to read the business plans of crazy dot com companies which tanked immediately.  It would be great to be able to contrast the two.  I'm thinking those business plans probably used a lot of made-up words to confuse the investors.  Paul's document is pretty succinct.<p>[1] as well as saving bandwidth and time, of course.",1175770987

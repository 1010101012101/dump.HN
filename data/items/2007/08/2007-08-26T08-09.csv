46703,comment,46614,46678,0,0,snifty,,,"Just because people are interested in ""Web2.0"" doesn't mean they're not going to be interested in the kind of stuff in this book. <p>In my opinion, interest in this sort of material is going to be propelled forward by Web2.0. It's not at all true that web programmers ""don't give a shit"" about mathematical modelling, etc. It's just that there hasn't been much accessible code for people to look at (much of it tangled in obscure, obtuse, proprietary academic and military labs). <p>It's true that this book seems to be attempting to cover a lot of topics, but that's probably the point: a decade ago, there was no popular concept, let alone interest, in relational databases. That changed because the street found a use for it, as the saying goes. 
 
Anyway, I'll second your Witten and Frank recommendation, cool book. ",1188116074

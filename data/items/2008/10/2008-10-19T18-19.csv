Michael Arrington is fed by venture capital firms and their portfolio companies, and has far too many conflicts of interest to be credible.  Most of his posts are extremely biased and tilted toward the current thinking of those feeding him information.  You gain no competitive advantage from reading this nonsense.",1224442717

On one hand, she seems to be a proponent of avoiding ""moral hazard"", i.e. the government should let financial entities which made bad decisions fail.  On the other hand, she appears to support Paulson's original proposal to buy up the toxic assets.",1224442603

I have never known a regulator to want less power, so libertarians are fighting a lost cause. That's ok, we're used to it.<p>As far as the rest of the world goes, European economic courses focus on the evils of the market and Marxist models of class struggle, so they're pretty much a lost cause too.",1224442307

In regards to ""gladly clicking on some google links"", I'd say it'd be more appropriate to be <i>willing</i> to click on their links, should they make them relevant. And that's what google has done so brilliantly! They're not asking people to please click on the links, or to be grateful for their free services, they're taking advantage of the natural self-interest people have, and making it to the individual's benefit to click.<p>I'm certainly right there with you as to the utility of Google, replacing them would be very dear indeed!",1224442019

337213,comment,336556,337026,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"No, I don't think David's book is what you're looking for. It's more of an argument that anarchy is a plausible and desirable arrangement for society given the current state of microeconomic thought. He offers a theoretical basis for private law enforcement and law making, as well as other functions that are normally performed by the state.<p>On the empirical side, he does have a very nice chapter on Iceland, which went without a public bureaucracy for a few centuries. Law enforcement was essentially a private business for awhile. It's a good read.<p>I know that one of the big Public Choice guys did some writing on the feasibility of anarchy (Buchanan, I think). However, I'm not sure if it's the kind of work you are looking for. There's been few functional anarchies on this planet that we know about, and it's not a topic that gets most economists published. I'll let you know if I find anything.<p>If you're looking for information on the problems of collective action, then the Public Choice guys are definitely the place to start (Buchanan, Tullock, etc.).",1224441478

337207,comment,337119,337119,0,0,charlesju,,,"I am typing this on the new Macbook.<p>I completely agree with the conclusion of this article, after using this Macbook for a week, the changes from the previous generation are phenomenal. The whole case is made out of one piece of aluminum which means that there are no screws anywhere, and that provides for a much more durable and robust case. The integrated GPU is AMAZING, I am getting  40-60 FPS in World of Warcraft, that is better than my previous Macbook Pro. The keys are awesome, the screen is brilliant, battery life is stellar, this notebook is 3-4 years ahead of its competition in almost every way.<p>If you just look at Apple's history, the iPhone is the best smart phone on the market, no other smart phone even comes close (look at the multiples of user engagement on the iPhone vs any other phone). OS X is so much better than Windows, look to any review or any user of OS X. And now, even the Macbook is leaps and bounds beyond its competition.<p>Like I said in a previous comment, surviving the recession is easy: make good (or for Apple, the best) products, charge for them, you'll do very well, recession or not.",1224440812

337202,comment,337042,337042,0,0,charlesju,,,"First off, the topic of this article is pretty misleading and kind of divisive. From the article's own admission, Google only allows monetization of start page gadgets that user's manually ad. The meat of the article was spent talking about the merits of a left UI navigation for Google's start page. (Personally, I think it should be a setting since I am on the laptop a lot, and it really kills screen space, but I'll live)<p>Further, I have a very hard time hating Google because they provide so much value to my life. They store all my e-mail through GMail, all my RSS feeds, all my documents, and now I have all my company internet assets managed through Google Apps.<p>I might get flamed for saying this, but I'll gladly click on some Google links on their start page or anywhere else, a few clicks of a mouse is definitely worth more than what they have given me. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'd subscribe and pay a monthly fee to keep Google alive, if they asked. People should be grateful for what they receive for free.",1224440405

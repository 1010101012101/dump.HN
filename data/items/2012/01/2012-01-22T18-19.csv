I don't agree with you that working is a choice at a mere 6 figures. Okay, maybe they can work one year and take five to ten years off unlike most people, but when their sabbatical is over they still have to work again. Or maybe it's easier than I thought to set up a $20k/yr passive income source. Maybe at 8 figures working for the next 20-40 years becomes optional, but even then that depends highly on your investments.",1327258694

3497307,comment,3496502,3497185,1,0,graphene,,,"I meant that members of parliament toe the party line in PR systems -- are you saying that members of parliament in Norway commonly vote against their party faction or even switch factions when they feel like it? If so, I'm impressed :-)<p>I fully agree about it being important that parties can be esatblished and elected easily; again in Belgium, there is a rule (initially devised to keep out the increasingly popular Flemish nationalists) that parties need to get 5% in elections to gain any seats at all.. It's good to hear not all countries have this!<p>I'm not so sure about the spirit of compromise being so positive; again relating to Belgium, decades of compromise agreements between Flemish and Waloon, and left- and right-leaning parties has created an institutional structure that is very complicated and obtuse (google the term ""Belgian compromise""), and indeed its complexity and inflexibility have been at the heart of the recent problems.<p>It might be a bit unfair of me to base all my argument on the example of a single country, but I guess my main point is that it is not so much the choice of political system which determinces how messed up things get, but much more the polititians themselves. I'm not surprised that you as a Norwegian seem quite satisfied with your political system, because Scandinavians have a reputation for being prudent and reasonable, and I would bet that it wouldn't make all that much difference if the rules there were more like in the US for example.",1327258584
3497306,comment,3496070,3497236,7,0,Silhouette,,,"I realise this is always a sensitive area, but please consider that there <i>are</i> in fact laws on the books and government policies in many Western countries today that are <i>every bit</i> as evil as the kind of thing that was going on in Germany at that time.<p>We have detention without trial for extended periods, or indefinitely if you mutter the magic word ""terrorism"".<p>We have outright torture of detainees, and people dying in prisons.<p>If a suspect does get to trial, it might be in a secretive court where they have no opportunity to confront their accuser or see and challenge all of the evidence against them.<p>We have laws that allow government agents to infringe on almost every fundamental civil liberty by one kind of executive order or another, some of which are strikingly similar to the Enabling Act in their effect even if the intent was not necessarily the same.<p>We have <i>routine</i> invasion of privacy and monitoring of the general populace without any reasonable grounds for suspicion/probable cause/whatever you like to call it. There are well-documented cases of routine national surveillance being set up by police or security services without any oversight or consent from elected governments.<p>We have seen far too many cases of obvious abuse of peaceful protesters (or simply those caught in the wrong place at the wrong time) and in some cases we have seen courts accept a defence of the indefensible.<p>We have seen deaths at the hands of police actions that were later shown to be completely unjustified and an operational screw-up from start to finish, for which no-one has ever been held accountable.<p>The biggest difference between the situation today and the situation in Germany around the Second World War is a matter of scale, nothing more. And I think that is exactly the lesson that Pastor Niemoeller was trying to teach. While matters of intellectual property are hardly the stuff of revolutions, when you get into things like routine searches of private matters without justification, which in turn build on other obvious abuses that have been going in in the interests of ""security"" at transport hubs in recent years, I think you're way over the line into ""why haven't we stopped this madness yet"".",1327258577

It's a question whether this guy is trying harder to destroy the Internet or the Fourth Amendment, but imagine how awesome it would be if that was just an academic question about a guy who didn't have a career in politics any more.<p>The bad news is he's been in office since 1987 and has won his most recent elections with crushing victories. The good news is he's a Republican, and SOPA is wildly anti-business; the other bad news is it may be tough to make that stick, because it's only obvious to the technologically literate. Fortunately, he also he has motivated, successful enemies on his home turf; his district includes parts of staunchly Democratic Austin, and that's because the Supreme Court ordered his Congressional district redrawn after the League of United Latin American Citizens won a gerrymandering lawsuit against then-governor Rick Perry. This probably also means he's extremely corrupt, but it's hard to imagine SOPA coming from anybody who wasn't extremely corrupt in the first place.<p>Let's all form a political action committee called the Coalition To Defend The Internet From Ignorant, Corrupt Assholes and get contributions from every millionaire in Silicon Valley so we can deep-six this guy so completely ""Lamar Smith"" becomes a synonym for ""no career in politics ever again.""<p>We can use a two-pronged attack; fund his Republican competitors, and find ways that they can show how pro-Hollywood and anti-business SOPA was (Republicans hate Hollywood), while at the same time also funding his liberal opponents. A Democratic victory in Smith's district is very unlikely, but his Democratic opponents probably hate him enough to make some noise, and I think it's extremely likely that Texas is full of younger Republicans who would love to take his place.

Yes, a lot of point make sense, iterate whats working, throw out whats not working.<p>But theres a giant conundrum to it, especially for certain types of startups. Lets take the startup I am working on now as an example. I am working on a Bookmarking framework for real life. Or you can call it, delicious for worthy experiences in life. But what was delicious without users? Not just do I want to bookmark material, I want to discover them too!<p>I had a ""MVP"", and it was really minimal. I spent 2 days coming up with a landing page (ctrleff.com), 1 day to plan and create the mockups, the second to actually turn it into fruition. Result? I frontpaged iPhone and Android's subreddit, and got about 10% conversion rate, while it is by no means great, it was certainly encouraging! But if MVP is all for motivation, then yes, I agree, by all means go ahead with building a MVP. But this landing page did nothing to tell me if my startup is going to be adopted or not. There were people who liked the idea. Thats it! This is no metric for any form of success. (Not every startup can be dropbox)<p>In my books, an MVP is an actual product that would determine actual user adoption. So the next step, or 2 months since the launch of the landing page, I'm done with the backend, and almost done with the Android App. And the app is by no means a sketchy app, I actually spent some time making sure that it looks exactly as what it should in the mockup, that it was not jerky, scrolling was smooth. Feature set? A minimal one: that is, the creation and digestion of Checkpoints (aka bookmarks). Thats it! But I am not stopping here, then there is the iOS app. Only then, would I consider my MVP done. A MVP that I won't hate to use and would continue to use. No double standards here, I will not release a product that I personally would not even use. I can be wrong, but I want to be proven wrong. Did I mention I'm a one man armt?<p>TL;DR: I hate the MVP movement, just build a real product with a minimal set of features.",1327258166

So how exactly is that free? i don't know.<p>Then what happens if you use something else to do the formatting then just convert using Apple program (if that is possible)? Or if you can't convert redo exactly the same formatting, or something really near. Apple risk to argue that you breached the agreement even if you technically might not have.<p>And then what happens if they recognize that you used another tool to publish on other platform, but the too version are still too close to their taste? That's when Apple's general attitude and evilness will enter the game. They will say: I don't publish you, and I don't have to give any reason for that. You might say, yeah it is the game, it is their right. Except two things: the kind of people who object that typically also fake a taste for liberalism and free markets and so on (they are more probably thinking about something anarcho-capitalism style and how it could be great to make a lot of money fucking people all around you just because you can). I recognize that given the current laws, it is not obvious that Apple's don't have the right to do that, they even might have. But I found this way of doing business highly disgusting. The second thing is that a numerical publisher in Apple style has nothing in common with a real publisher. Their marginal cost for publishing you is absurdly low, their margins guaranteed, and they don't help you with you work (well yeah they kind of help you by ""giving"" you a program, ok in that case i suppose buying a fancy pen gives the builder some right on the story you wrote with? -- in any case this ""help"" as nothing in common with the help of a real publisher).<p>It all can be summarized with: Apple is constructing a giant monopolistic market, because well it is obvious that monopolies works and brings an absurd amount of money. And now every other giant multinationals find how brilliant this is and are trying to do the same, even for PC.

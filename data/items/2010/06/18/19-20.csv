You're going to be finding the same issues with any other nas/raid solution and with the drives you use in them. Maybe drobo is more likely to fail than the others or something by unfortunate design (and with droboshare, I could believe the fs corruption), but they all have the potential to fail in some way. (You're also talking to someone that's had more SSDs than hard drives die on her in the past six months...)<p>When I was shopping around for drobo alternatives (back when I couldn't stomach the price just yet to buy one and I was getting a bit sick of my hacked-together raid in one of my computers), product reviews and blog entries read exactly like what I see here with the drobo being hit or miss. There were people that were all ""DO NOT BUY!!"" because they lost all their data next to the people just gushing over how much they liked theirs cause it was working like a charm. This is a tough market, because people don't want to lose their data, and when (not if...) they do they get quite pissed.<p>It's really up to you to determine your needs and to find a device or twenty that meets them. I rather like the drobo because it's zero maintenance. I don't trust my data to it, I only trust it to keep working when a drive has failed. But that's about all I can expect from any such device. The whole market is pretty much hit or miss for people - it's a hit until it misses, then all you can think about is how it missed.",1276891145

Here are some reasons I don't like Objective-C (these mostly apply to iPhone dev only)<p>- Header Files: These are archaic and require you to repeat code unnecessarily. Don't require humans to do something that computers are better at.<p>- No Automatic Garbage Collection: On the ObjC 2.0 we have this, but not on the iPhone. Unless you are making a high performance game, there is no reason the phone can't handle Automatic GC.<p>- No NSDictionary/NSArray literals: [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:@""value"", @""key"", @""value2"", @""key2"", nil]; // Enough said<p>- No regex: You kind of get regex's in 3.2, but they are very limited. Regex literals are much more powerful<p>- Xcode: You are pretty much required to use Xcode and I don't like Xcode. Even if you use the ""xcodebuild"" command-line script, you still have to create the project through Xcode.<p>- Closures: I guess we will be able to use these soon, but it is going to take awhile for all the API's to get updated to accommodate them.<p>- No dynamic variables: It's handy to be able to shove data into objects sometimes. It's a hack, but as long as you treat it as such you can save a lot of needless code. (You can do this via the ObjC runtime, but it's messy)<p>- No namespacing: ObjC handles namespaces by prefixing class names. Blah, that is so 1978.<p>- Unit Testing: ObjC has the poorest excuse for unit testing out of any language I've ever used.",1276891026

It's perfectly fine to tell him to pick a name that isn't a graphical symbol.<p>Between countries, I think generally the right approach is to use the country's naming customs, and adapt foreign names to them, to the extent reasonably possible. In Greece, for example, it's customary to transliterate people's names into the Greek alphabet, especially if the source is going to be read by Greeks (newspapers, etc.).

Bad year, you struggle.\nLaw firms, consulting firms, investment banking firms. You want to be your own boss but don't have the capital\nor you don't want to take the risk.<p>(6) Project. Film-makers, authors, musicians, really - many people can do this. An entrepreneur who goes from\nproject to project to project. 100% project when on, 0% in-between project. Good model for people who are good\nenough to get work whenever they want. Serial entrepreneurs - 4-5 yrs build company, sell it, sabbatical/downtime, repeat,\nrinse. If you are the kind of person who gets deep into something and it's the only thing you can do (on). And\nneed downtime when you're not working 100% (off).<p>(7) The sole-proprietorship lifestyle-focus. Travel around world, run business from laptop. People can live vicariously through you. Sole proprietor\nbut also using business as way to live lifestyle. Young, not married, no kids.<p>(8) The Startup. Hustling every day. Moving fast, lots of energy, fun group. Successful or not - who knows? Challenges.\nMaybe they'll be successful. Maybe not. But they're giving it a shot.<p>(9) The Breakout. Idea inside another company. Build it. Might take a life of its own.\nIncubate another company. Spin out into another company. Become a business.<p>(10) The Company",1276888001

This bit near the end is a good encapsulation of the idea, I think:<p>""What will work, for folks concerned with protecting software freedom? Providing solid and useful free software alternatives. Finding ways to make those alternatives sustainable businesses (or non-profits, like Mozilla) so that contributors can be paid to keep those tools free and functional. The FSF should be at the center of this effort instead of trying to hold users back to the stone age of computing. But if they won’t be, then it’s time for others to solve these problems rather than joining the Party of Gno.""<p>What I think Joe Brockmeier doesn't realize (maybe I'm wrong) is that this has been precisely the central aim of the Free Software Foundation for the past half a decade at least. They may have gotten some things quite wrong - I think it's clear now that the GPL 3 was a mistake - but they've taken up and published the latest draft of of the Affero license, which is <i>the</i> alternative for developers seeking to build free and open-source software-as-a-service. Listening to clips of Stallman's evangelistics may lead you to believe that he's being purely negative, but the fact is that the FSF has offered and supported what's probably the most viable and practical solution to the problem.<p>Also, it seems to me that one reason we really can't write RMS off is the simple fact that he's turned out to be quite correct in some of his predictions. He stood against ESR's change in nomenclature to ""open source,"" saying that calling it ""free software"" was the only way we could be sure that we were understood; at the time, it seemed like a silly pronouncement about unimportant vernacular, particularly because RMS is given to silly pronouncements like that. But in fact he's turned out to be absolutely right: now, with ""open source"" in its ascendancy, <i>everyone</i> calls their products ""OPEN,"" whether they're <i>actually</i> free or not. Every MS press release is an opportunity to read that particular four-letter word at least a few dozen times, though it never means much of anything; and companies like Apple and Google (for all the good that Google has sometimes done for free software) like to brand their products as ""open"" when they're often anything but.<p>RMS may seem like a bit of a crank, but he's always seemed that way - and yet he frequently proves to be right. I don't think we should write him off just yet.",1276887653

6223223,comment,6221077,6222799,5,0,vidarh,,,"> There have been, historically and presently, power and wealth grabs by the already powerful, and manipulation of political and social structures to suit their needs.<p>Sure. But that does not conflict with &quot;emergent structure&quot;: There&#x27;s no need for a cabal at the top consciously arranging the structure of society. Just a bunch of people who are often trying to manipulate things in specific directions, and where a lot of them will have overlapping motivations. From the outside, that can look very much the same.<p>A lot of the time people are not necessarily even trying to steer things a certain way, but merely looking after their own interests.<p>E.g. a central idea in marxism is that the capitalist is not really at fault: He&#x27;s &quot;caught up&quot; in the system just as much as the worker. He is exploiting people working for him, but he does not necessarily intentionally want to oppress. He is merely playing his role, protecting what he sees as his own interests, just like the workers.<p>And so you get &quot;nice&quot; capitalists, who try to do better, but they can still largely only act within the confines of their role: The only way the capitalist can top oppressing, is by ceasing to be a capitalist. But that is not in his interest, and it is unreasonable to expect the capitalist to willingly do so - he will find every excuse for not giving up his privilege (and many might be good; e.g. it is perfectly possible an individual capitalist might be doing more net good with his profit than it would have if he shared everything equally with his workers). Ultimately, marxism is cynical about human nature: We are all looking out for our own interests; to the extent we do not, it is because we lack awareness of our real interests or position.",1376650368

Perhaps you&#x27;re thinking of the beta version which included the code to not allow Windows to run on any dos other than MS-DOS. The reason obviously is purely technical. Because of the way Windows 3.1 worked it required access to internal MS-DOS undocumented data structures which could not be guaranteed to work on any other DOS clone.<p>In fact Windows crashed on MS-DOS 4.0 because the internal data structures changed.

Learn through MOOC&#x27;s, with course content using the proposed solution. (Solves Book problem)<p>2. Questions being asked on hackernews, stackoverflow, ... and being syndicated into a central stream.<p>3. Validation of learning / knowledge through challenges & contests. (Real world applications of this knowledge, less theoretical and more practical application). (Solving the experience problem students face after graduation, quality of contribution could be the new Grading standard)<p>Practical example:
Topic -> Computer Science -> Cryptography -> PKI
Question -> ECDSA...
A recent practical example is Hyperloop, I feel that this field could greatly benefit from this approach in turning it into a potentially viable solution, with practical applications in many countries,especially in the developing world.

How about you just meter out enough oil to meet your life needs? Nah, they&#x27;ll call your country a terrorist axis of evil and invade to help the oil flow.<p>ok how about this. How about you do a deal and pump as much oil as possible as long as you can exchange it for something real. and you have a long time cultural affilation for a yellow shiny metal. yeah that will do. How about we do a deal. We keep the oil pumping as long as we can exchange a ratio of oil barrels for this shiny metal.

- It has terrible arrow keys, which basically forces you to use hjkl. 
- It is small enough to be able to reach all keys w/o moving my palms.
- in UK layout &#x27;\&#x27; key is under my left pinkie, so I don&#x27;t have to remap leader to anything else. &#x27;@&#x27; for macros is in a good place too.
- Esc key is big and positioned separately, easy to use.",1376647484

6223091,comment,6221602,6222396,4,0,001sky,,,"This is a generalized problem with insurance, tho.  Ie, if you had a likely expense, you would plan for it (house, college, etc).  You buy insurance precisely because you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll need it.<p>So, the people that need to use it are always going to be a small group. The people that don&#x27;t have it, another group.  The people getting screwed (on the sharp end) are the subset of those where there is overlap. This will always be a small number (by math).<p>That being said, for everyone is paying into the system but its more death by thousand cuts. As long as pricing is opaque and uncorrleated with out-of-pocket marginal payments, there will be a problem.  The cleaner solution is simply to remove the facade of pricing a-la-carte services.<p>The problem there, is two fold: (1) how to control the inevitable buracracy with a huge budget making life or death decisions; and (2) how to incentivise research and science/product development without the cash cow of monopoly pricing (patents are useless if selling is illegal).<p>While these problems seem to be solvable, they are daunting and not simple.  In a world where the NSA is spying on every electronic communication over the internet, perhaps even more so. Ie, a world where privacy and trust is being undermined by those seeking to entrench their own power. Its harder poltically to delegate more responsibility to the &quot;government&quot;.",1376647430

They lead to more innovation, value, and freedom of choice for consumers, and a vibrant, profitable, and competitive ecosystem for businesses. Many companies will claim roughly the same thing since they know that declaring themselves to be open is both good for their brand and completely without risk. After all, in our industry there is no clear definition of what open really means. It is a Rashomon-like term: highly subjective and vitally important.&quot;<p>..<p>&quot;To understand our position in more detail, it helps to start with the assertion that open systems win. This is counter-intuitive to the traditionally trained MBA who is taught to generate a sustainable competitive advantage by creating a closed system, making it popular, then milking it through the product life cycle. The conventional wisdom goes that companies should lock in customers to lock out competitors.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;To understand our position in more detail, it helps to start with the assertion that open systems win. This is counter-intuitive to the traditionally trained MBA who is taught to generate a sustainable competitive advantage by creating a closed system, making it popular, then milking it through the product life cycle. The conventional wisdom goes that companies should lock in customers to lock out competitors. There are different tactical approaches  razor companies make the razor cheap and the blades expensive, while the old IBM made the mainframes expensive and the software ... expensive too. Either way, a well-managed closed system can deliver plenty of profits. They can also deliver well-designed products in the short run  the iPod and iPhone being the obvious examples  but eventually innovation in a closed system tends towards being incremental at best (is a four blade razor really that much better than a three blade one?) because the whole point is to preserve the status quo. Complacency is the hallmark of any closed system. If you don&#x27;t have to work that hard to keep your customers, you won&#x27;t.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;In other words, Google&#x27;s future depends on the Internet staying an open system, and our advocacy of open will grow the web for everyone - including Google.&quot;<p>The entire thing is a good read.",1376647421

6344016,comment,6343751,6343751,8,0,rdl,,,"I love AgileBits (makers of 1Password).<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that the highest risk is pure-cloud services.  There, it&#x27;s trivial to get a legal order or technical compromise to steal the data.  A &quot;hostproof&quot;, download-on-each-use app, like LastPass, is essentially the same risk as a cloud app. (this is the hushmail and lavabit vulnerability.)<p>The safest is some kind of purely-client software, with local data, which operates online, and is never updated.  Ideally open source, with a trustworthy build process.<p>In between is software like 1Password.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider 1Password + Dropbox sync to be safe -- NSA has open-door access to Dropbox if they wish to get a single user&#x27;s data (and possibly more).  Tricking a user into download a compromised version of 1Password wouldn&#x27;t be terribly difficult even without the cooperation of AgileBits.<p>You can use 1Password more safely (local-only, infrequently updating, some kind of local-firewalling in the client, etc.).  Without the client being open source, it&#x27;s really difficult to  do more.  It&#x27;s probably a hell of a lot safer on OSX than it is on iOS, since at least some OSX users are likely to do real network monitoring, or otherwise be on some kind of debugging enabled system, or something with just weird bugs, uncover a problem, and then dig into it and find a backdoor -- on mobile, there&#x27;s little risk of that.",1378529575

6344013,comment,6343125,6343549,6,0,Sami_Lehtinen,,,"Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for over an year now. Yes, it does really speed up things. I&#x27;ve found out that people grossly over estimate need for SSD space. I&#x27;m using 64 GB SSD with 3TB drive and hard disk is really rearely touched. I&#x27;ve even enabled power saving spin down for it, so I know when it starts. In normal daily usage HDD isn&#x27;t being touched at all. It&#x27;s only when something like linux updates are being run or so. I&#x27;ve also enabled write-back caching without maximum time limit. If you use write-through caching it naturally causes HDD to run all the time. I&#x27;ve chosen to cache everything, not only random reads. Because I have plenty of space with 64 GB SSD. I don&#x27;t know what people are doing who claim thei need larger SSD than that. Maybe they&#x27;re working with large data sets or have absolutely massive games or so. As summary, yes, I love it. SSD is never full, I&#x27;m not running out of disk space and yes,  I do get pure SSD performance over 99% of the time. Only if I pickup some movies or music which has been around for months without being accessed then there&#x27;s HDD access of course.\nSetup was ok, because I did it when I replaced my computer so I built everything from scratch anyway. I&#x27;m going to blog about that, but I have huge backlog of stuff to get blogged. P.S. Some cache vendors (like Seagate Hybrids drives) recommend using write-through caching, because in the case SSD dies, you&#x27;ll still have fully working file system on HDD. With write-through caching, things are going to be very badly messed up if SSD dies. Practically totally unrecoverable situation. But that&#x27;s why we got backups, right?",1378529493

6344011,comment,6340233,6343855,2,0,philwelch,,,"Darwin didn&#x27;t advance a comprehensive philosophical system but rather a unifying theory of biology. And it was not a theory that was unique to him; he only published his theory of natural selection when it was independently developed by another scientist. He gets the credit in the same sense that Newton (or is it Liebniz?) gets credit for calculus--it has simply passed into accepted truth and it&#x27;s merely a question of history as to who came up with the theory of natural selection.<p>Rand, on the other hand, advanced a large, comprehensive philosophical system that has never been independently arrived at. Every Objectivist becomes such by reading and becoming convinced by the works of Rand and her associates. And very little disagreement with Rand is tolerated--certainly no disagreement with what she clearly incorporated into her philosophical system itself. This is the behavior of disciples, not simply people who agree with a philosopher. This is not to say that they are wrong, but that they are engaging in a behavior--namely wholesale acceptance of another person&#x27;s thoughts--that fits, for me, the denotation and connotation of the word &quot;disciple&quot;. And it doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit that some disciples of Rand bristle at that word, because the word fits.",1378529354

6344008,comment,6343751,6343989,5,0,unimpressive,,,">Lavabit sets an interesting precedent really<p>&quot;The office of <i>La Batalla</i>, the P.O.U.M.\npaper, which was not defended, had been raided and seized by the Civil Guards at about the same time as the Telephone Exchange, but the paper was being printed, and a few copies distributed, from another address...<p>The Civil Guards were still occupying strategic points. Huge seizures of arms were being made from C.N.T. strongholds, though I have no doubt a good many escaped seizure. <i>La Batalla</i> was still appearing, but it was censored until the front page was almost completely blank. The P.S.U.C. papers were uncensored and were publishing inflammatory articles demanding the suppression of the P.O.U.M. The P.O.U.M. was declared to be a disguised Fascist organization, and a cartoon representing the P.O.U.M. as a figure slipping off a mask marked with the hammer and sickle and revealing a hideous, maniacal face marked with the swastika, was being circulated all over the town by P.S.U.C. agents...<p>At various points in the town there were posts manned by Civil Guards of Carabineros who stopped passers-by and demanded their papers. Everyone warned me not to show my P.O.U.M. militiaman&#x27;s card but merely to show my passport and my hospital ticket. Even to be known to have served in the P.O.U.M. militia was vaguely dangerous. P.O.U.M. militiamen who were wounded or on leave were penalized in petty ways--it was made difficult for them to draw their pay, for instance. <i>La Batalla</i> was still appearing, but it was censored almost out of existence, and <i>Solidaridad</i> and the other Anarchist papers were also heavily censored. There was a new rule that censored portions of a newspaper must not be left blank but filled up with other matter; as a\nresult it was often impossible to tell when something had been cut out.&quot; - George Orwell, <i>Homage to Catalonia</i> (1938)<p>I wouldn&#x27;t expect that particular warning sign to persist for long.",1378529218

6344006,comment,6341785,6343966,4,0,babby,,,"- nodejs: Write in coffeescript or javascript on the server, two bird with one stone philosophy. Will let you build better programming techniques in respect to structure due to (1) it&#x27;s async and (2) it&#x27;s module based. Unlike php the global namespace should not be used. Additionally, JS is just better than PHP in every way I can think of. Node has a thriving user module community. Cons are that you have to deal with async, module dependencies and setting node up on a server (or really anything besides PHP) is far more complex.<p>- GO: google&#x27;s lang, seems to be trending lately. Lets you build potentially more elegant, higher performance web apps (if you believe the benchmarks) than node but will have a higher learning curve, less of a userbase.<p>- Python: Someone else will have to comment on python (and probably GO).

I disagree.  Imagine that you knew this morning&#x27;s unemployment number a second before everyone else.  Could you have become a bazillionaire?  No.  Your potential windfall would be limited by how much of a position you could take on without moving the prices of instruments past the point of where they likely would end-up after the general availability of this economic indicator.  Order books are fairly light right before a number is released because most participants presume themselves to be the victim of a better-informed trader if the option they &quot;wrote&quot; by putting an order on the book is exercised.  So, you as a well-informed trader would have limited opportunity to take on position without paying at least as much as the likely value of that position after everyone knows what you knew a second beforehand.  Conversely, imagine that you knew a day or two ahead of time what this morning&#x27;s unemployment number would be.  You could slowly build up a huge position and make orders of magnitude more.",1378528641

Their capacity was 6000 TEUs, one-third of the Mary Maersk. The captain of one of the ships (a 27 year old (!) German woman) told me most ports cannot handle the 6000 TEU vessels, so their line will be building mainly 4500 TEU ships.<p>One interesting thing is that those older, smaller ships had more powerful engines than the much larger current vessels! The engine installed on the 6000 TEU vessel was ~90,000 hp, and the ship was designed for sailing at ~25 knots, the justification being that the value of cargo onboard was so high that the cost of shipping was dominated by the interest charges!",1408506896

Smaller farmers go to farmer&#x27;s markets to sell their goods.<p>For example, one of my favorite farmers is located in the central valley.  They do about 6 markets a week driving to a different city every time.<p>Basically at least in California and in most of the nation there is some type of farmer&#x27;s market infrastructure so to speak.  This infrastructure makes it easier for the farmer to find buyers by only specifically targeting certain markets/cities.<p>In terms of farmers finding buyers specifically I don&#x27;t think there is an existing model of b2c directly (at least yet).  The closest thing I can think of is you are kind of similar to a CSA.<p>Lastly the best thing to do is put yourself in the farmer&#x27;s shoes and look at it in their perspective.

8200984,comment,8200247,8200968,23,0,deathanatos,,,"poll is fairly portable, but still has scaling problems. To get beyond scaling problems, you usually need something OS-specific, such as epoll (Linux), kqueue (BSDs of some kind), etc. One of the things I&#x27;d expect of a cross-platform networking library would be to use the best available abstraction, especially on major platforms such as linux, and perhaps fall back to select on odd platforms. Of course, your docs need to point out what the behavior is.<p>The problem with poll/select is that you need to pass (transfer) to the kernel the entire list of events you&#x27;re interested in, just to wait for a single event. Each time you re-enter your event loop you need to do this, and if you have thousands of connections, it will break down, because poll is O(number of connections).<p>epoll, for example, works around this by having an &quot;epoll FD&quot;, which on the kernel side contains all the events you&#x27;re interested in. You wait by just waiting on that epoll fd with epoll_wait, but you don&#x27;t specify the events you&#x27;re interested in when you wait: you do that ahead of time, with other system calls. This allows you to change the event list only when you need to, which is much less frequent than some data arrived from somewhere. The API is supposed to be O(1), instead of O(number of connections) per wait call.<p>My understanding is the kqueue works similarly, but I&#x27;m a Linux guy, so I can&#x27;t really tell you.<p>select also has other problems w.r.t.

Granted it only changed in June, but he&#x27;s quoting an obsolete RFC. (And if you look up the RFC on the IETF&#x27;s website, the header color will indicate this, along with the &quot;Obsoleted by…&quot;) Currently that section¹ actually reads:<p>> Historically, HTTP required the Expires field-value to be no more than a year in the future.  While longer freshness lifetimes are no longer prohibited, extremely large values have been demonstrated to cause problems (e.g., clock overflows due to use of 32-bit integers for time values), and many caches will evict a response far sooner than that.<p>Honestly, they could have just specified a &quot;never&quot; value, like the word &quot;never&quot;. That said, I&#x27;m not sure a forever resource would be a good idea: the other side&#x27;s cache would never empty, and honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a piece of data that never changed, either because the spec did eventually change, or the data was incorrect due to human error, etc.<p>Further, you can&#x27;t really guarantee a response will be cached forever: caches get cleared all the time for a variety of reasons. Cache to reduce load, not to put some sort of new behavior in the system.<p>¹<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.3</a>",1408504787

If we chose it the other way the equation would still hold, it&#x27;d just not be the standard convention and thus less recognizable.

The key word in that definition is <i>find</i>. How can someone &quot;like&quot; (in the true meaning of the word) something, or for that matter &quot;dislike&quot; something, if they have never &quot;found&quot; (/used) that something in the first place.<p>Therefore it is incorrect to say that you personally like or dislike something if you have not had direct exposure to that something. At most it would be correct to say that others in your peer/social group like or dislike something.",1381485584

6532241,comment,6531896,6532024,1,0,goo,,,"I think the concept of &quot;e-minimalism&quot; is great.<p>I think it is useful to recognize that &quot;stuff&quot; is a system, and as a user, the system of &quot;stuff&quot; requires some maintenance, is at risk of failure (by theft, loss or damage), though despite the drawbacks does provide benefits that make life better. My water filter makes water taste better; my sweet chair is very comfortable. My car drives me to the beach to surf regularly. Some stuff requires greater scrutiny -- the high maintenance demanded by the car in terms of time and money indicates that I would be wise to carefully consider if the benefits outweigh the costs.<p>Technology systems can be measured similarly -- do the costs (time, money, cognitive load, opportunity cost, presently and in the future), outweigh the benefits. Making that measurement is difficult, and our minds are not exactly rational actors when it comes to deciding to adopt technology -- we are easily swayed by social factors, and it is hard to measure the future cognitive load and opportunity cost of a technology system. Being an &quot;e-minimalist&quot; could be a useful heuristic.<p>Since benefits of &quot;stuff&quot; and systems can vary subjectively, I think minimalism (as a philosophy or hobby) is a subset of a larger identity question from the individual -- &quot;what is my relationship to the systems at play in my life?&quot; Attempting to optimize that relationship usually leads to more happiness than ignoring the question.<p>For some people, minimalism for &quot;stuff&quot; is a solid optimization. E-minimalism makes lots of sense, too.",1381485337

Like producers of cosmetics encourage us on a regular basis to use up as little of their products as possible? I like what Chomsky said on a somewhat similar topic:<p><i>If I&#x27;m analyzing capitalism and I point out that General Motors tries to maximize profit, that&#x27;s not a conspiracy theory. That&#x27;s analysis.</i><p>It&#x27;s not a conspiracy theory that companies try to maximize profit, in fact that&#x27;s one of the basic assumptions of free market economy. I don&#x27;t even ascribe any particularly cynical viewpoints to any of the individual people involved, but in any large company responsibility becomes so diluted it&#x27;s easy for things that are quite bad for society in general to just happen without anyone being left with much remorse. I think it&#x27;s quite rational to expect that markets that are not regulated to some extent might degrade in those nasty ways.",1381482226

Is short: if you were using XHTML markup with text/html MIME, you were using marketing XHTML, which was parsed by browsers' engines as HTML not XML anyway.
If you were using application/xhtml+xml MIME type you'd know the difference.
It would be interesting to see how XHTML was ""easier to manage across browsers"" given that IE does not even understand XHTML.<p>I used XHTML for a short while before I learned what it actually meant. Then I switched to HTML4.01, now HTML5. 
The nice thing about HTML5 is that it let's you have any syntax you want and it is not based neither on SGML nor XML.",1292423912

He said filing would cost $250, so we said to go ahead.<p>We were flying a mile-a-minute during tax season, so we had him file extensions for us. Later on in the year, we worked with him to file our taxes. During the process, he sent a note (that I thought nothing of), saying - in summary - ah yes, we have to file both personal and S-Corp returns for you.<p>In the end, he sent me two bills: one for $200 (why not $250), and another for $400 (assumably for the heretofore forgotten S-Corp return).<p>THEN I just got a letter from the IRS saying I owed $712 (to the S-Corp) for failing to file taxes on time.<p>How on earth do I deal with this situation? The whole point of using an accountant was to outsource the work so I could focus on my business; there's nothing so complex about it that I actually needed his expertise. So now I find myself considering spending considerable time rectifying the screw up.<p>Outside of legal recourse, how do I deal with him? And assuming good faith negotiation doesn't work, what is my possible legal recourse?<p>I assume I can refuse to pay his fee above what he quoted me, and it is HIS obligation to sue me for outstanding payment, but now I'll have to pay the IRS for his screwup in filing, so I assume getting compensated by him for that in court would be something I'd have to tackle.<p>Argh!",1292423546

2008147,story,,,2,0,bhavin,"Discuss HN: Washington post experiment, from an HN perspective",,"Most of you must have known the Washington post experiment involving Jushua Bell. For others, this is brief version: Joshua Bell donned a baseball cap and played as an incognito street busker at the Metro subway station L'Enfant Plaza in Washington, D.C. on January 12, 2007. The experiment was videotaped on hidden camera; among 1,097 people who passed by, only seven stopped to listen to him, and only one recognized him. For his nearly 45-minute performance, Bell collected $32.17 from 27 passersby, from the same set of people who would offer cumulative thousands of dollars for his on show. (full version: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html)<p>The story obviously raises few interesting and important questions.. one of the I mean to talk about is following:
• If all the branding is removed, are we able to recognized raw talent?<p>My gut answer to the question is (unfortunately), no. Everyday we see marketing taking precedence over true quality. Specially among tech startups (e.g. Zynga rips off some upcoming game developers game and releases nearly identical games and puts huge effort in marketing and gets away with it!)<p>With all the possibilities of incoming flames, allow me to say that I am noticing something similar in Hacker News as well. I might be partially or totally wrong on this, but it seems like certain topics, certain celebrities, certain blogs and certain HNers (all of it better remain unnamed) gets biased upvoting, sometimes without any quality whatsoever in the content of the post while some smart blogpost written by some unknown dude might never make it to the light of top 30.<p>I just mean to ask an opinion of fellow hackers on that. Does everybody here feel that only quality is admired on HN and not branding?<p>P.S. I don't mean to start any flame wars, so in case this post doesn't make sense, feel free to flag it.",1292422689

2008137,comment,2007504,2007504,0,0,thinkingeric,,,"For experienced programmers, the clearest introduction to Common Lisp is the first few chapters of ""Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp"" by Peter Norvig. His writing style is exceptional. Not quite so clear, but also not too dense, is ""ANSI Common Lisp"" by Paul Graham. Peter Seibel's ""Practical Common Lisp"" is dense (words per page), but is good for a ""now I know a little Lisp, what can I do with it"" book to read second. Winston's ""Lisp (3rd)"" goes from an extremely basic intro to heavy-duty AI without building up to it. But you can get it cheap, so it is worth it for a beginning reference.<p>As a sidenote, when you first look into Lisp, you hear a lot of kvetching and mocking about parentheses. And indeed, there is a point in the learning curve where you get confused about the proper numbers of parentheses for certain kinds of expressions (so-called 'special forms'). And you see Lisp apologists countering that it's not the parentheses that matter; rather the indentation is what helps you understand the code.<p>In my experience, what happens is that as you become familiar with these 'special forms', you learn to recognize the visual patterns of indentation and parentheses that are particular to each of these expressions. And once you write a number of them yourself, grokking the code of others is no problem. And as in all languages, a decent editor and syntax coloring is helpful.",1292422505

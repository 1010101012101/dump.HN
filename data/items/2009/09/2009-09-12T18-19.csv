(Ironic, isn't it?)  So, I walk with her to make sure she gets across that street safely.<p>(Before you ask: there are 6 potential street crossings onto the school grounds.

(One example: my oldest is now able to be dual-enrolled at our state university at the age of a twelfth grader, taking the upper division abstract algebra course and the algorithms and data structures course for his ""high school"" program.) I have changed in religious point of view over the years, and my personal website reflects a point of view that is not my current view. By working from my name (ascertainable from my HN profile) to my personal website via Google you'll find my large website on homeschooling, Learn in Freedom (oh, well, I just told you the name), which is NOT current but is nonetheless informative. My oldest son would like to bring the web technology on that site into the twenty-first century, as I would like to bring some of its facts and figures a decade more up to date, but it will do for a start.",1252781419
819261,comment,818834,818834,0,0,butterfi,,,"I'm not sure ""the relationship between ability level and challenge"" is what MC means by flow, if that's what you're saying.<p>Q: ""What is ""the flow experience"" and what does it have to do with motivation?
A: The flow experience is when a person is completely involved in what he or she is doing, when the concentration is very high, when the person knows moment by moment what the next steps should be, like if you are playing tennis, you know where you want the ball to go, if you are playing a musical instrument you know what notes you want to play, every millisecond, almost. And you get feedback to what you're doing. That is, if you're playing music, you can hear whether what you are trying to do is coming out right or in tennis you see where the ball goes and so on. So there's concentration, clear goals, feedback, there is the feeling that what you can do is more or less in balance with what needs to be done, that is, challenges and skills are pretty much in balance.""<p><a href=""http://www.edutopia.org/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-motivating-people-learn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edutopia.org/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-motivating-p...</a>",1252781383

You just download the official tool set and program in the official languages against the official APIs.<p>As for the Java-related stuff, installing NetBeans is pretty much a no-brainer. It even comes with its own Java runtimes, if you want it to. And it can work with Java, PHP and Ruby. From phone apps to server apps running on those 1000-core Azul beasts. That's a range Windows can't touch.<p>Eclipse is a little harder to download (there is a bewildering amount of options) but it's one impressive tool stack and rightfully deserves that compliment people traditionally reserve to Emacs: it's a great operating system, lacking only a decent IDE.<p>To put it in other way, do you really want to hire a programmer who can't understand/install/adapt/make his own tools?

Perhaps my friends are all overscheduled Bay Area people but we do use calendars outside of work. Furthermore, promoters and venue owners do have to use something like a calendar tool, eventually, and that is a potential gateway to grabbing good event data and republishing it.

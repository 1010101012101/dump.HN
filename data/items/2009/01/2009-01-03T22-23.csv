418744,comment,418672,418672,0,0,mpk,,,"The author apparently doesn't understand where the confusion in the original question (or variations) comes from.<p>One way of phrasing it is asking,<p>""If you have an unrelated man and woman and they both have two children (one of which is a boy), where the oldest son of the man is a boy - what are the odds that they both have two boys?""<p>(There are any number of variations on this - what are the odds of the man having two boys? what are the odds of the woman having two boys what are the odds of the man but not the woman having two boys .. all the same problem, but stated differently).<p>This 'loads' the question by implying (superficially incorrect) that there might be a difference between the chances of a man and a woman having two boys.<p>Next up is a bit of probability theory. In the case of the woman, no order is stated, so the chances of her two children have no connection - the events are unrelated. The man, however, has as a <i>first</i> child a boy (which eliminates the possibility of this being a girl).<p>This is another variation on the Monty Hall problem,

418740,comment,418582,418682,0,0,mdasen,,,"There is nothing that they do so bad.  The issue is that there's nothing that they do that's so compelling.<p>Today, you can get a VPS from Slicehost, Linode, Amazon, or a number of other providers.  A few years ago, Slicehost was just starting up and there was a waiting list of months sometimes, Amazon's EC2 had no persistent storage, Linode was using User Mode Linux which is terribly slow. . .  Joyent was fast, had lots of bandwidth, SAN storage, offered 16 and 32GB RAM servers, were the host of next big thing Twitter, and were the official host of Ruby on Rails.<p>Today, Slicehost is a division of Rackspace and SAN storage will probably be available soon.  There is no waiting list or prepayment for Slicehost anymore and you can grab a 15.5GB server.  Slicehost is under half the price of Joyent except for transfer costs (Joyent includes 10TB with each plan - whether that's like Dreamhost's ""unlimited"" bandwidth is yet to be seen).  Today, EC2 is no longer beta, comes in various sizes (medium, large, XL) and has persistent storage.  And all three (Linode, Slicehost and EC2) all offer instant activation.  With Joyent, it's a human-run system.<p>That probably one of Joyent's biggest failings.  While Slicehost automates all of its build process so that you can be up in a couple minutes, Joyent requires a tech person.  More than that, they tied themselves to OpenSolaris and Sun and there hasn't been as much activity there.  Plus, they're telling everyone to use Solaris' Blastware packaging system which is just bad and most people would rather have their own Linux flavor (as their competitors allow).<p>Now for Joyent's advantages:<p>-Zones offer fast disk access compared to Xen.  This probably makes it more suitable than Slicehost or Linode for a really high-end database server, but it probably wouldn't beat EC2's EBS which is just really fast.<p>-SAN storage.  Joyent can offer you (virtually) as much storage as you need.  EC2 can as well, but Slicehost and Linode can't.<p>Joyent used to be where it was at.  Linode, Slicehost, and EC2 have caught up and in some ways surpassed it.  Combined with a lack of polish on the Joyent backend (surprising since they spend a ton on their frontend polish) and it just doesn't look great.  Don't worry too much.  It's not as if it's terrible or anything.  It will serve you, but you probably could have gotten something cheaper somewhere else.  Joyent needs to rework some of its infrastructure to remain competitive with a Rackspace owned Slicehost, a non-beta EC2, and a Xen-powered Linode that is constantly increasing CPU, bandwidth, RAM, and disk to its users.<p>Bottom line: Joyent offered a scalable storage, CPU, and RAM architecture back when Slicehost, EC2, and Linode didn't.  So, if you thought you were going to be the next big thing and need a few 8GB servers, Joyent was the only game in town.  They aren't any longer and don't seem to be taking steps to ensure they aren't history as others improve.",1231022587

The risk of your twitter password getting out is impersonation and taking control of your twitter account, with no way to recover it.  Remote keys have problems too, but the idea behind remote keys is that you enable third party access to the core functionality but the authentication and control of the account itself is out of reach of the third party.",1231022244

418722,comment,418309,418513,0,0,thwarted,,,"Does this apply with the cell phone handset market?  A market that has been trained, from the beginning, based on differentiation of both crappy hardware and crappy software options AND on the lack of true portability of data and apps?  It becomes easier to test out new hardware without having to test out new software and lose all your data (contacts, content, apps) at the same time.  People seem to instantly get ""If someone doesn't like the address book on an Android phone, there's at least the capability to replace it with something else that someone else wrote"" (I think people see the value in this because the address book functionality on handsets is, in general, REALLY crappy) -- this feature has not existed, short of potentially second class Java apps that are difficult to acquire and install, on any other handset previously.<p>The variations and options of Android will appeal to people who did not previously consider themselves to be members of the smart phone demographic.  Android has the potential to put a smart phone in the hands of these people.  And this market is, ultimately, larger than the potential iPhone market, what with more hardware and service vendors.",1231020792

But I am trying quite hard to write a comment to say there is another way, and it is better.<p>> you can try and hurt them twice, no matter the cost. Culture choice.<p>In trying to hurt them twice, can you hurt them for what it costs you to do so? Or do you just have to pay that cost out of pocket? And if you hurt them twice, but they only directly did one bad thing to you, can they hurt you back? And can you hurt them back for that? Most wars are founded on logic such as this.<p>If you are talking Jewish philosophy, what about Job (the book is newer than an eye for an eye, but Job himself probably lived before the Torah was given)? I believe Job says (amongst other things), ""Life isn't fair. Good things happen to the bad guys. Bad things happen to the good guys. Accept that in the knowledge that God will make it right in the end.""",1279795960

It is not possible to open read-only WAL databases. The opening process must have write privileges for ""-shm"" wal-index shared memory file associated with the database, if that file exists, or else write access on the directory containing the database file if the ""-shm"" file does not exist.</i><p>> <i>7. There is an additional quasi-persistent ""-wal"" file and ""-shm"" shared memory file associated with each database, which can make SQLite less appealing for use as an application file-format.</i><p>And in Backwards Compatibility [1]:<p>> <i>To prevent older versions of SQLite from trying to recover a WAL-mode database (and making matters worse) the database file format version numbers (bytes 18 and 19 in the database header) are increased from 1 to 2 in WAL mode. Thus, if an older version of SQLite attempts to connect to an SQLite database that is operating in WAL mode, it will report an error along the lines of ""file is encrypted or is not a database"".</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/wal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlite.org/wal.html</a>",1279795951

Just in this post I see the following:<p>1) You have side projects and experiments that have interesting enough ideas behind them that you think they may be worth pursuing beyond 80%.
2) You think you should be familiar with more than Javascript, PHP, Java, and MySQL.
3) You are not completely happy only being comfortable in a Windows XP environment with whatever IDE you are using.<p>Each of these items has a clear next step.  (1) Think about your projects, pick your favorite one, look at the code and do something minor.  (2) Poke around and do some light research (if you haven't already) on other dev stacks, play around until you find yourself genuinely interested in one.  (3) Install Ubuntu  in a virtual machine (VirtualBox is free and works well) or dual boot.  Google vim and emacs and pick one to start playing with.<p>If you feel like you are falling behind you can use that as an opportunity to figure out what you're unhappy with specifically and do simple things to take a small step forward.

Basically, the apps don&#x27;t control when they can do their background fetching. It&#x27;s up to the OS, which uses your usage patterns to determine how often backgrounding can occur.  So, beyond the setting where you can disable this functionality, the intent is you use your apps like normal and it adjusts itself to your patterns.",1378310351

6328432,comment,6328177,6328177,14,0,mbateman,,,"> We turned to KnowEm.com, a website I often rely on to search for usernames, even though the site is primarily intended as a brand registration service. We certainly had a front-runner for her name, but we would have chosen something different if the KnowEm results produced limited availability or if we found negative content associated with our selection.<p>> With her name decided, we spent several hours registering her URL and a vast array of social media sites. All of that tied back to a single email account, which would act as a primary access key. We listed my permanent email address as a secondary -- just as you&#x27;d fill out financial paperwork for a minor at a bank. We built a password management system for her to store all of her login information.<p>> On the day of her birth, our daughter already had accounts at Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and even Github. And to this day, weve never posted any content.<p>While I can definitely understand the sentiment and have thought about doing similar things, seeing it all laid out like this seems very strange.<p>1) Is your twitter/gmail username really that important? Is this sort of personal pre-SEO really that much of an issue? And if it is, won&#x27;t that just put enormous pressure on new services every generation as people want the slate (username and searchability) wiped clean for themselves?<p>2) Shouldn&#x27;t setting all of this up be something your kid eventually does (or that you help them do)?

I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised to hear that they hold secret mathematical breakthroughs that render half or all of the encryption algorithms the public are aware of useless.<p>Paradoxically, if that is true, I think it could work to strengthen the average American&#x27;s privacy.<p>If the NSA has made significant advances in cryptography that allows them to read pretty much anything, the focus will undoubtedly be placed on &quot;national interests&quot; - intercepting and reading high-level communications from friends and enemies alike.<p>More importantly, though, the NSA would want to ensure everyone keeps using the encryption they know how to break. If a twenty-year old systems administrator discovered and leaked that the NSA can break AES, the NSA would lose that significant advantage.<p>So, at least in the short term, the NSA being able to read everything would likely mean they read nothing of mine!",1378310197

All that without understanding how legacy code works. You&#x27;re wondering what&#x27;s the secret here? Instead of trying to deduce the undocumented logic behind legacy code I gathered current requirements and implemented them in the simplest way possible.<p>Except one of the main reasons legacy code tends to be so long is that it deals with tens/hundreds of small edge-cases or bugs that your &quot;sub-100-line method&quot; simply cannot account for. So what you are doing when you re-write the legacy code without even understanding what it does is regressing the product by several years in terms of maturity and stability. Your new code will face the same problems the legacy code did, except it will break. And then you will have to start adding to it...<p>Now, it is absolutely possible that those edge-cases and bugs that the legacy code dealt with are no longer an issue: maybe they were added back in Windows XP days, and your users no longer use Windows XP, or something. In that case, yes, go ahead and rewrite it. But you need to think about and understand what it does first, and why.",1378310091

Since that time, social networks and email providers such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn and Yahoo! have embraced open identity standards. And now, billions of people who have created accounts with these services can use their identities to easily register and login to sites across the web in the way myOpenID was intended.<p>By 2009 it had become obvious that the vast majority of consumers would prefer to utilize an existing identity from a recognized provider rather than create their own myOpenID account. As a result, our business focus changed to address this desire, and we introduced social login technology. While the technology is slightly different from where we were in 2006, Im confident that we are still delivering on our initial promise  that people should take control of their online identity and are empowered to carry those identities with them as they navigate the web.<p>For those of you who still actively use myOpenID, I can understand your disappointment to hear this news and apologize if this causes you any inconvenience. To reduce this inconvenience, we are delaying the end of life of the service until February 1, 2014 to give you time to begin using other identities on those sites where you use myOpenID today.<p>Speaking on behalf of Janrain, I truly appreciate your past support of myOpenID.<p>Sincerely,\nLarry",1378309665

These large standard errors accurately reflect the uncertainty of having highly related explanatory variables.

Pushes are not guaranteed to arrive at all, nor arrive in a certain order.<p>- No sensitive information in pushes, since it&#x27;s (mostly) transmitted in the clear.

On the other side of the spectrum you could see upwards of 100ms.<p>It&#x27;s really bad when you get something like 30ms to 70ms of random delay. You can&#x27;t predict this type of randomness and since it happens every frame it makes for a very poor gaming experience.<p>Think about a competitive game like quake 3 where you might be playing at a LAN where you have a 5ms ping but your monitor is giving you 30-50ms of random input lag. You would be at a -massive- disadvantage if your opponent had a monitor with 2-7ms of input lag.<p>There is a world of difference between 30ms and 60ms at a competitive level.",1378308729

Since that time, social networks and email providers such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn and Yahoo! have embraced open identity standards. And now, billions of people who have created accounts with these services can use their identities to easily register and login to sites across the web in the way myOpenID was intended.<p>By 2009 it had become obvious that the vast majority of consumers would prefer to utilize an existing identity from a recognized provider rather than create their own myOpenID account. As a result, our business focus changed to address this desire, and we introduced social login technology. While the technology is slightly different from where we were in 2006, Im confident that we are still delivering on our initial promise  that people should take control of their online identity and are empowered to carry those identities with them as they navigate the web.<p>For those of you who still actively use myOpenID, I can understand your disappointment to hear this news and apologize if this causes you any inconvenience. To reduce this inconvenience, we are delaying the end of life of the service until February 1, 2014 to give you time to begin using other identities on those sites where you use myOpenID today.<p>Speaking on behalf of Janrain, I truly appreciate your past support of myOpenID.<p>Sincerely,<p>Larry",1378308346

Almost very start up poster on here is &#x27;rewriting&#x27; an app in that sense.<p>If you can&#x27;t &#x27;rewrite from scratch&#x27; (i.e. write a new app) you probably don&#x27;t have very good programmers (they are only comfortable bandaiding and throwing a few routines in existing code), or, perhaps, management is tying their hands someway. So, I don&#x27;t buy into the horror stories. Well, I buy that they exist, just not that they should drive my decisions.<p>Of course, you should expect the cost of your new app to be about the same as entering the business cold. It&#x27;s particularly difficult to meet every requirement/feature/bug of the old system. Orgs get fossilized around features. If you were to download and install a new IDE you&#x27;d expect it to have different features from the old one. You will miss some of the old features, but presumably the new features more than make up for it (otherwise why would you switch). Yet, when we upgrade apps, it&#x27;s &quot;remove nothing at any cost&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make a lot of sense. It can take enormous effort to re-implement some broken feature as opposed to just offering a new way to do things.<p>None of that is to say I blithely throw code away. I did, once, amidst a bunch of hue and cry of &#x27;oh no&#x27;, but it was the correct decision because the old system was hacked together by &#x27;weekend programmer&#x27; (my boss at the time who was very smart but learned programming from a book). I turned it into a modular, decoupled system, and most of those parts got reused over and over in different parts of our vertical. If you have a plan, and the old code doesn&#x27;t, it can pay off.<p>There&#x27;s more to be said, but this is a wall of text already. Every day I work in the refactor mode, even while mostly adding new features. Its an extremely powerful idiom. But I also have my eye on code that really needs to go to the big bit bucket in the sky. No one understands it, every fix introduces new bugs, and what it is trying to do is very well served by existing open source code, or code be written from scratch.",1378306873

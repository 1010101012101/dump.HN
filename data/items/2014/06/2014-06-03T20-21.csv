7842687,comment,7837450,7841336,1,0,VLM,,,"OK... first of all there are thousands (no joke) of coupler designs.  If you&#x27;ve seen &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot; you&#x27;re familiar with 1830s era chain/buffers but those are obsolete.  I can only talk about the modern USA Janney coupler.  My comments might be totally wrong in Norway or Russia or pretty much anywhere else.  Saudi Arabia of all places uses Janney couplers. (edit to add my point is there may exist a coupler design in Germany or England or something that inherently uses springs.  Just not in the USA, not for over a century, ours are solid bars of interlocking hands made of steel with a guard that prevents them from unlocking and a pin/latch arrangement that prevents them from swinging open...)<p>Anyway if its under tension it can&#x27;t be unlocked.  When you release tension you can shove a pin out of the way (if its not rusty) and it then can be unlocked.  So that in itself is an interesting comment.  If the train isn&#x27;t under tension it literally can&#x27;t fall apart short of metallurgical failure (like a crack) and train crews don&#x27;t like it when their train falls apart, so the don&#x27;t like their train not being under tension.  All freight couplers are the same but the hazmat and passenger car couplers are a little weirder and slightly harder to uncouple and have a lot less slack by design (I&#x27;ve been told its mostly closer mfgr tolerances).  None the less couplers do rust and removing tension means a rusty coupler could unlock and train crews hate that.  So yeah, crews don&#x27;t like a train that gets compressed.  You have to back up to switch but you don&#x27;t do it for fun or whatever.  Aside from the whole visibility thing which means you could kill some poor dude a half mile away backing over him and never know it.<p>The thing that connects the coupler to the center of the car is called the draft gear.  To say it has a high spring coefficient would be an understatement.  Some cars/engines don&#x27;t have any draft gear at all and the coupler is welded right to the center / spine of the car.  When a train couples, the spring flexes so things aren&#x27;t permanently bent.  Its not like a shock absorber in a car which flexes all the time while rolling along, its more for damage reduction (edited to add, and the coupling process itself)<p>The slack comes from the 1/2 inch or so space in the coupler, times a large number of cars.  A hundred coal cars times 1/2 inch is like 5 feet of slack ...  So no need for springs you&#x27;ve got all the slack you can handle in the couplers.  You could spec a coupler with 1/16th inch precision but then every time you switch a freight car you&#x27;d need a guy with a sledgehammer to screw around for 10 minutes so thats hazmat and passenger only which I have no experience with.<p>Since the (19)60s all cars have roller bearings and the static friction is so low that unless you applied the brakes in some weird manner the cars will kinda flop around on their own.  Pushing a train is an interesting experience that should be a part of all physics experimental curricula.  You really can push a train by hand.  It won&#x27;t be easy and it won&#x27;t go fast and it definitely won&#x27;t accelerate very fast, but its not hard.  So you could only guarantee compression if you&#x27;re actively moving / just moved or you&#x27;re headed downhill slightly.  Wind can actually move cars around.  This is why all cars need a parking brake (that horizontal wheel) in addition to the air brakes.  It would be mechanically complicated to put a train under compression but it could be done by locking the brakes or something.<p>The static friction of a car is like 100 pounds if the bearings are in good condition and the parking brake is completely removed etc etc.  The slightest incline, or maybe even wind load, exceeds the force of static friction.  If you have a hundred tons of coal in a car, the static friction is a mere rounding error.  It might be calculable, or even measurable, but it won&#x27;t be noticable when driving.<p>(edited to add the best car analogy I can give is its like a skateboarding kid hanging onto the back of your car, you&#x27;re just not going to notice the extra friction compared to the mass of the car)",1401829061

7842677,comment,7842233,7842368,3,0,uulbiy,,,"Let me start by answering another question.<p>Why do people use webmail? Because it&#x27;s convenient. If I use a client like Thunderbird and download all my emails then if I want to find one of them I have to search for it on the device that I downloaded it. Of course I could upload my emails on a server and access them from other devices but it&#x27;s a hassle. Webmail solves this problem. Additionally, why competent, smart, technical people very often don&#x27;t use digital signatures? Same as before plus if you want to use your emails in other devices you have to transfer your secret keys and remember their passphrases.<p>The transfer of the secret keys is what will keep the usage of this extension low. Therefore, Google succeeds in gaining more trust while offering something that you can already achieve on your own using other software like Thunderbird with the Enigmail extension. Also, note that even by using a digital signature you hide only the emails that you choose to send encrypted and those that you receive encrypted by the senders. I use digital signatures every day, I usually send and receive signed messages. However, the percentage of unencrypted messages in my inbox is probably more than 99%.",1401828968

Reality is based on perspective of Existence. Thus Reality is relative and seen by some as &quot;mutable&quot; (though I prefer the functional &quot;immutable&quot; view of a Reality).<p>So the adherents you are talking about are viewing Reality perfectly well. It&#x27;s just their Reality is different from yours. Now if their Reality is based on an illusion, like the bad plumbing in the OP, there&#x27;s the matter of changing their perception & Reality by exposing the illusion.<p>> But it would be free of disagreement born of irrational prejudice.<p>What is irrational is in the eye of the beholder & heavily influenced by culture. To your point, some cultures are closer to absolute truth (less based on illusion) than others.<p>However, even Rationality is based on a culturally defined Reality. What was Rational 100 years ago in America may not be Rational today.<p>As humanity progresses, we expose the truth and create more illusion in different areas of Existence.",1401828894

They need a desk and office space and computer, they need health insurance/unemployment, you need HR to manage all of this. So it ends up being much more expensive (and complicated) to have two part time employees than one fulltime one. If most benefits were decoupled from employment, a lot (but not all) of these costs go away.",1401828597

7842632,comment,7839226,7841644,11,0,simonster,,,"As you say, when it comes to the brain, there is only a modest relationship between how things feel and what damage is being done to neurons. Neurons themselves do not feel pain, so it is quite possible that you could take drugs that severely damage your brain without feeling their effects. Conversely, headaches and hangovers reflect irritation of the tissue surrounding your brain or of the nerves leading to it. While in some cases a headache can reflect a serious problem that affects or could affect the brain itself (e.g. meningitis), in most cases headaches don&#x27;t imply damage to the central nervous system.<p>I am a neuroscientist (in training, at least, in a subdiscipline that&#x27;s only somewhat related but does occasionally involve drugging monkeys). There is good evidence that frequent use and probably even rare use of MDMA is bad for brains. Neurons don&#x27;t necessarily die, but axons disappear. It is not clear that rare use of MDMA can cause lasting cognitive impairment in humans.<p>While DrugMonkey is sometimes a bit of an asshole, I don&#x27;t find much fault with his assessment of the current state of MDMA research in this post: <a href=""http://scientopia.org/blogs/drugmonkey/2012/07/25/single-oral-dose-mdma-neurotoxicity-revisited/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scientopia.org/blogs/drugmonkey/2012/07/25/single-ora...</a>. Note the caveat in the comments: although MDMA is probably neurotoxic, it is still not clear that the neurotoxicity translates to behaviorally meaningful deficits. There exist studies that have shown such deficits, but there also exist studies that have not. Most studies are correlational; I have yet to see a longitudinal study that provides convincing evidence that MDMA itself is a causative factor.",1401828547

That creates additional friction. A permanent menu would be a good idea in that case.<p>But, if the most common use case involves a user mostly navigating from a main page (like a timeline or feed), then hiding the menu becomes less of a big deal. They will &quot;organically&quot; navigate through content from the timeline. Therefore allowing more space for the main element (the timeline) makes sense and increases the quality of the user experience.<p>As a plus, removing items from the screen helps make the action that you&#x27;d prefer the user to perform more obvious. That increase conversions in a context when you want the user to do certain things.<p>Lets focus on good UI/X design, which is often case dependent.

7842515,comment,7842133,7842237,4,0,kannanvijayan,,,"ARC is a reasonably straightforward feature that can largely be thought of as a syntactic pre-pass.  Figure out which fields on objects need to have refcount instrumentation, insert the appropriate incref and decref before and after the write, respectively.<p>That said, the runtime overhead of reference counting is significant and works against the cache architecture of modern CPUs.  In a refcounted system, a simple field update  Update(obj, offset, target) becomes the following:<p><pre><code>  Object *o = obj[offset]\n  if (--(o->refcount) == 0)\n    AddToBackgroundFreeList(o);\n  ++target->refcount;\n  obj[offset] = target;\n</code></pre>\nIn assembly, in the best case, this roughly translates to:<p><pre><code>  1. Memory load (to get obj[offset])\n  2. Memory load (toget obj[offset]->refcount)\n  3. Decrement (refcount of old value)\n  4. Memory store (to update obj[offset]->refcount)\n  5. Test (to see if old value is now dead)\n  6. Memory increment (to update target->refCount - 1 instruction on x86/x64, 3 on ARM)\n  7. Store\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s assume the best case: the old object being dereferenced does not become dead, and the branch predictor is good with the Test, so (5) is the cost of an ALU instruction and no misprediction penalty.<p>However, memory accesses at (2) and (4) are at arbitrary locations on the heap.  The old value in the field points to an object anywhere on the heap, and the new value being stored points to an object anywhere on the heap.  Neither of these memory locations are as likely to be as relevant to the current working set as the memory of the object being written to.  After (2) and (4), you&#x27;ve gone through a bit of cache churn.<p>Now, this is happening on every single write.  It&#x27;s a HUGE overhead.  Secondly, because refcounting doesn&#x27;t really have an understanding of the object heap as a whole, it&#x27;s generally impossible to do moving memory management for these languages.  This means one of two things: either an expensive |malloc| for all allocations, or if you&#x27;re using pool-based allocation - fragmentation of memory.<p>A modern GC reduces this overhead quite a bit.  The state-of-the-art currently in reducing the overhead here is the combination of generational GC with card-marking for the older generations.  Memory allocation cost is literally 3-4 instructions, and there&#x27;s no fragmentation.  Most object writes are cheap, since most activity happens in the nursery where write barriers don&#x27;t need to be updated.  The average write overhead for pointer-writes into the nursery is an extra load and a bit-test, but this extra load is from the same memory space that the field-write will be writing to, so either it&#x27;s already in cache or going to be pulled in soon.  Pointer writes to non-nursery objects have a larger overhead, but this is still smaller than doing the corresponding refcount checks.<p>The big advantage of refcounting is how this overhead is split up across program runtime.  Proper GC has the issue of pause times due to garbage collection.  Modern designs have basically eliminated pause times as it relates to general computing, but it can still be an issue in games etc. where a GC in the middle of frame, even a few ms long, can cause a frame skip.<p>Refcounting has its uses and its advantages, but it&#x27;s dangerous to think of it as having no runtime overhead.  It has a HEAVY cost on performance and it thrashes memory and it works against CPU cache architectures.",1401827254

Digital marketing tools have evolved in the past few years and it&#x27;s a lot easier to measure success on specific tactics. I think the old school mentality of marketing is &quot;spray and prey&quot; and if that is what one&#x27;s thinking of marketing is, then they are not doing marketing correctly. The job of the marketer is to make the life of the sales person much easier so that the conversations they are having are meaningful and have greater chance for conversion.",1401827119

When I first started working at Canonical it was when they were jumping on the whole netbook bandwagon.

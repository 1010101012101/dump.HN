First, you can't do this for free as you can only show publicly the last 200 photos without a pro account.  With a pro account, you simply create a set for your 365 project to separate it from the rest of your photos: works great.  Plus you get awesome views like a calendar that shows the photo a day in a small thumbnail, and all kinds of sorting options (though old-> or new-> are all you really need.) Flickr's partnerships with photo printing companies can also be really convenient and probably makes Flickr some extra money too.<p>The only reason that I personally was able to complete my 365 was because I had options for uploading my photos direct to my set from my phone (I tried various paid apps until I found one I was mostly happy with.) If I had to sync my photos with my computer first then it never would have gotten done. Obviously on the one hand it would have been great to have 365 high quality photos from my DSLR, but the convenience of the iPhone was the only way I could keep up some days.  In other words, an app or a simple way to e-mail photos to the program would be a must for me.  And I probably spent $50 specifically for my 365 between Flickr Pro membership and various apps I tried, so I don't see the $11 as off-putting in itself at all.<p>If you're curious about my 365, I took a photo a day of my Toy Story Toys: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/dafalcon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/dafalcon/</a> - the set is on the right side.

Feeding all those people will mean increasing food production by 70%<p>According to the World Bank we're already at almost 6.8 billion people. This means we'd need to feed an extra 33% of the worlds population, meaning we'd need approximately 33% more food as our food usage already factors in losses from production, delivery, etc.<p>The only way you get 70% is if you made 9.1 the divisor when it is the dividend. You take where we will be 9.1, divide it by where we are 6.8 and you get how much more production we need 33% (IE 133% of present). If 9.1 is the divisor you get ~75%, more likely 70% as this will have been based off of a few year older (but likely slightly more accurate) population counts.<p>So, to put it simply, a whole bunch of people in the UN can't do basic math.<p>> Soil erosion will not be a problem because the food will be grown hydroponically—in other words, in a solution of minerals dissolved in water.<p>In other words - it will taste like nothing.

2024925,story,,,1,0,bd_at_rivenhill,"Ask HN: experience with outsourcing human resources",,"I'm about to hire a first employee, and I would prefer to hand a lot of the administrative burden over to someone else.  I've investigated a few firms that handle payroll, but there are others that offer to handle everything that a company would normally hire human resources professionals to do.  I have a basic understanding of payroll, health insurance, and 401k after running an single employee S-Corp for over a year, but I'm concerned about the legal complexities of having employees who aren't me.  Does anybody here have experience with doing this?  In particular, I've come across the concept of Professional Employer Organizations (AKA employee leasing firms) and the whole thing seems a bit fishy, especially since most of the information that's readily available seems to be produced by these firms themselves and I'm wondering what the practical difference is between this approach and (to use a term that seems to have been coined by the PEO industry) an Administrative Services Organization that handles the paperwork and provides advice but isn't the employer of record.",1292864635

8563534,comment,8562449,8562449,0,0,serve_yay,,,"Actually, I think an opportunity was missed in the section about dependency injection. The problem of minifying is easy enough to avoid - you just don&#x27;t use that form. (I do agree that the tutorials shouldn&#x27;t be teaching the dangerous form, and the dangerous form shouldn&#x27;t even be a thing.)<p>No, what I hate about Angular&#x27;s DI is that it tries to make inferences about the name you give it, instead of the name being an unambiguous identifier. It does this for &quot;convenience&quot; but it just ends up causing problems and making incorrect guesses.<p>I&#x27;m talking about how, for example, if you have a class called WobbleController, you don&#x27;t inject &#x27;WobbleController&#x27;, you inject &#x27;Wobble&#x27; and Angular just &quot;figures out&quot; the &#x27;Controller&#x27; part. Pretty sweet when it works! Wow, you don&#x27;t have to type 10 characters! (Good luck grepping for it later, though.)<p>But when it makes a wrong guess it seems impossible to fix. The other thing that sucks about this is that you have to reload your app to see if Angular will actually be able to find the thing you&#x27;re injecting. This whole thing is supposed to save time, and it just doesn&#x27;t. It sucks.",1415213983

It&#x27;s also really easy to believe that somebody who <i>enjoyed</i> being a &quot;poet-musician&quot; is rather bitter about the fact they now spend sixty suited hours a week wearing a suit composing boilerplate prose, and their whining about what a massive waste of time their job is isn&#x27;t a particularly good illustration of misallocated resources. It&#x27;s natural to believe that stuff you enjoy doing is more socially valuable than stuff you don&#x27;t, but personal feelings of validation are an even worse proxy for social value than the market system.<p>In particular I&#x27;m unconvinced by the link drawn between &quot;talented poet-musicians&quot; failing to get their recording contracts renewed and maldistribution of incomes, as if the 99% were unable to afford to patronise poet-musicians rather than seeing no value in doing so. And funnily enough, if the poet musician suffered from being undiscovered rather than untalented, they could probably benefit from the endeavours of people involved in the drudgery of service sector &quot;bullshit&quot; jobs like A&R man, ad exec, or analyst for music retail platform.",1415213327

While the US could certainly do so without suffering meaningful sanctions or major geopolitical harm over the long term, indifference to treaty obligations is often the hallmark of an insular political viewpoint - but then such people also tend to be uninterested in the ramifications for international trade and cross-border institutions in the first place.<p>That said, the SCND dates back to 1961 which was 53 years ago, and those countries which have openly stepped back from full compliance with it such as Portugal and Uruguay don&#x27;t seem to have incurred any disadvantage or sanctions worth talking about, though you might argue that they had little or no political capital to lose in the first place. I do think there&#x27;s a global shift towards looking at drug abuse and addiction as public health issues rather than moral vices, so while there&#x27;s pressure form some quarters to maintain or strengthen anti-drug enforcement there&#x27;s also pressure to adopt more utilitarian policies focused on harm minimization and demand management.<p>I think the convention will not be explicitly derogated any time soon, but will rather be allowed to become a dead letter through diminished contributions of fiscal and political capital for enforcement, while being nominally and loudly upheld by more authoritarian regimes as both a blunt instrument in trade negotiations and as a proxy for the rule of law.",1415213078

The upgrades in this version are enormous: The debugger in 13 was only semi-usable because it&#x27;s pretty hard to write any interesting debugging expressions in Scala without using a lambda, and lambdas were completely unsupported in 13. It&#x27;s not quite the Java debugger, but I&#x27;ll take it.<p>I have yet to try if their SBT support has improved as much as it should: The old SBT import worked if your project was simple, so it worked for all the toy projects I have, but it always failed on anything serious I did for work.<p>The Scala plugin lags behind the Java support a little (I&#x27;d love to have the  new annotated code feature that Java has in Scala), but IMO, it sure beats doing the same work in eclipse, or in an editor that doesn&#x27;t understand the language at all.",1415212611

Frankly it is a big mess and often you are not told which definition is being used. Not only that the definitions change over time! I had to deal with this data for many years - not simple at all.<p>Which one is most appropriate depends on your goal. La Jolla or Mission Hills are probably a lot more like SF than the SD MSA so likely perform more like SF but will still be tied to SD.<p>Unfortunately sales only occur infrequently and tend to dry up completely in recessions. This along with lack of data as well as different definitions make tracking detailed property types like 4br 3ba Spanish in La Jolla difficult and unreliable if not impossible. And in SF (city & county) that property type is very rare (also SF does not publish style data like some area - I think SD might). Best you can usuallydo is by bedrooms in a zip but only if the market is pretty active.<p>My original point was a simple one: even though real estate moves together across the country with the business cycle over time area can still diverge significantly. This has happened in SF vs LA/SD and in California as a whole vs the rest of the US. To see this look at the index levels over longer periods. Maybe go with a big areas like MSA/CMSA so you have lots of data and get both mature inner city and fringe suburbs - this is what Case-Shiller public indexes are like.",1415212287

My sense is that most commercial software vendors want you to use their software and want you to get it legitimately and want to find a way where you can pay what vaguely seems like it should be mutually agreeable (if you&#x27;re using it educationally, there are often ways to get it for free, if you&#x27;re a developer for a large organization, they want that organization to actually pay for it and support the value they&#x27;re getting out of you using it).<p>I worked on MS Office and I once remember Sinofsky (then in charge of Office) once talking about the pricing structure of Office and saying nobody paid the ~$400 MSRP.  People get it bundled with new computers, pay substantially lower upgrade fees, or something else.  I don&#x27;t remember if he went so far as to say &quot;at some level, people pirate it&quot; but that&#x27;s a reality that only the really oblivious would ignore.  The point is - try stuff out, see what you like, and try to figure out what makes you the most productive without worrying about &quot;some day I won&#x27;t be able to afford this&quot; (but by all means you should also rabble-rouse if you find the prices for the software you use are unreasonable and inflexible).",1415211334

The problem is that it is over-promoted and over-sold as a versatile platform that can do anything. When you actually try to model complex business logic, however, you&#x27;re screwed. Unless your business model conforms closely to their pre-built model, Salesforce development turns into an exercise of shoehorning your data into a system that just can&#x27;t accommodate it.<p>If you need to model data with a lot of junction objects, good luck getting reports. You can only report on up to 4 objects at a time. Let&#x27;s hope that you don&#x27;t need any serious data aggregation since matrix reports limit you to 2x2 fields. You want to store data in JSON format and access it through a NoSQL database? You&#x27;ve got to build it outside of the system and have it talk to that database through custom code. But I thought Salesforce could do anything!<p>And on top of all of those obstacles, you get the privilege of paying a high monthly fee for a system that you&#x27;ll probably only be able to get working if you shell out yet more license fees for 3rd party apps that hopefully fill in the gaps. But at least they just released a new analytics system that overcomes some of the absurd limitation on reporting that are inherent in the system--but of course it will cost you.<p>That being said, the alternatives better be good if I&#x27;m going to pay for them. Postgresql enterprise is probably worth it, given how awesome the free version is.

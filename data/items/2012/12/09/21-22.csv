In so far as a humanities scholar employs scientific methods, I am happy to call him a scientist.<p>> Here's a Greek manuscript. There's a lacuna in the text. What is the most likely correct emendation? If you use a statistical method to answer, explain how you compiled your corpus of comparisons.<p>This lacuna is going to be filled using scientific thinking employed by the humanities scholar doing the. He is going to make comparisons to other documents and to other knowledge about the period, language, etc. That is to have some hypotheses about the lacuna, he is going to gather data, and then he is going to analyze that data in the context of the lacuna and propose solutions.<p>As has been pointed out, there are existing computational systems that do this kind of work. There is a long history of work on this kind of problem from information theory and cryptography.<p>> Oh my yes, just like football and gourmet cooking are worth doing. Besides which, your science labs are going to need industrial designers and lawyers, and at least a couple historians of science to warn you away from past methodological errors. Which means you also need at least a few scholars of rhetoric, fine arts, philology, general history and archaeology to train them.<p>I did not make my point clearly. Let me make it again: if your methodology does not produce parsimonious models of the world that can be used to make accurate predictions, then what is the point of doing it? If you cannot produce testable claims of fact about the world, what is the point in doing it?<p>I was suggesting to you, to take a jocular example, that if you know that astrology does not work, then it is not worth doing, even if it is your only method of making predictions.<p>Your point about industrial designers and lawyers is a non sequitur in this context. I am talking about methods of discovery and methods of testing knowledge claims.<p>As to psychoanalysis, the reason I brought it up is that it is still rampant in large parts the humanities: intellectual history, comparative literature, and English the chief problem fields.",1355090156

This forces you to keep everything up to date, not just some notion of the 'core system', which is what you're getting from Mac update. Of course, you have to have some discipline and stage major updates in a testing area before you actually update production servers, but I think you'll find key packages like OpenSSL should probably be kept up-to-date.<p>Personally, I maintain a system which consists of about 30 CentOS servers; not large by any means. But things like upgrades and monitoring are a non-issue; we test updates before we apply them, and we use Nagios for monitoring.<p>As someone downthread pointed out, you can get a SuperMicro 1U server with a hell of a lot more horsepower than a Mac Mini for an equivalent price; the motivation for Mac servers seems to be almost exclusively to test and build Mac-specific software.

Other people are using different assumptions about war and how to measure it maybe they have something to offer you in perspective.<p>For example a war is not merely summed up by number of peoples killed nor is it understood by the chance that a single person at that time period might be killed or the total world population killed. In fact the level of war or numbers of wars could increase dramatically without any increase in violence by merely varying the culture, technology and other circumstances.<p>You did not address the fact that the source you cited for your argument supported my claims and not yours.

4896268,comment,4894812,4895022,12,0,cmccabe,,,"OK.  If you just want the technical details:<p>* FreeBSD supports ZFS, whereas Linux can't really due to license issues.  (Although people have tried-- please don't reply to me saying ""but XYZ got it to run!""  It's a legal issue that's not going away.)  However, Linux has btrfs, which delivers a lot of the benefits of zfs.  However, btrfs is not really at the same level of stability yet (although it may get there soon.)<p>* For its audio drivers, FreeBSD uses a descendant of OSS, whereas Linux moved to ALSA and later PulseAudio-over-ALSA.  I have heard claims that OSS4 provides lower audio latency.  I am not an expert so I cannot evaluate those claims.  On the other hand, Linux also has JACK, an alternative sound API which is supposed to fix some of the latency issues of PA+ALSA.<p>* The original version of Rubberhose (the deniable encryption filesystem) was written for FreeBSD by one Julian Assange.  I don't think it's still maintained, though.  There was a version for Linux 2.2 at some point, but good luck getting that to compile in this day and age.<p>* Linux in general has a lot more APIs between kernel-space and user-space.  In Linux, you've got procfs, sysfs, debugfs, netlink, and so forth.  BSD was a lot more conservative about adding APIs.<p>* The FreeBSD jail mechanism is pretty good.  Linux has seccomp, SELinux, SMACK, Tomoyo, cgroups, and so forth, but none of them are as easy to use as jails.",1355089740

Most of the studies tend to be on Pubmed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). A lot of references can be found on wikipedia, which is a great resource in itself.<p>This is paired with playing with neurotransmitter levels using the methods described (and occasionally some less legal ones) and trying to relate feeling to thought. After a while, an intuitive understanding of the terrain that is the body, thought and emotion begins to emerge. Sometimes you feel something new, notice an interaction, make a prediction that neurotransmitter X has relationship Y with neurotransmitter Z, google for studies and are surprised that said relationship has been observed. Intuition is as accurate as the information it's working with - it can sometimes be trusted and other times cannot. I'm a programmer and to me this feels identical to debugging in a messy monolithic legacy codebase. I use the exact same techniques to try to figure my mind out.<p>I think that it is important to be picky about sources. I do not trust anything which cannot be backed up by a study, though less accurate information can sometimes point you somewhere interesting.

I was half expecting the next paragraph to warn me to look both ways before crossing the street.<p>The Code has a very broad definition of harassment that makes no distinction between a one time comment and a pattern of repetitive behaviour intended to intimidate or cause harm.<p>I see that ""following"" is one of the actions that defines harassment.  How does that differ from stalking?  I assume they are not referring to Twitter.<p>From what I understand, the code was approved by the Board of Directors of the PSF, and not the PSF as a whole.  Please, correct me if I am wrong.  This is ironic since one of the Board members was walking around the conference last year with a damaged stuffed python toy asking, ""Would you like to see my one eyed snake?""<p>This was said to one of my female colleagues.  I asked her if she would like me to say something and she replied, ""No, it is just creepy, but I'm an adult.""<p>The Board's aspiration to create a welcoming environment is laudable and this spirit is very much a part of the Python community.  I don't think that the Code, as worded, helps accomplish this.  It is overly broad and loosely defined.  The result is that it sounds like an attempt to infantilize the attendees and proscribe behaviour that may be part of vigorous exchanges of points of view.<p>I am sure that this is not what the Board intended, but you would wish for a more articulate expression from a group of engineers who would not tolerate this sense of generality in their code.",1355089240

4896230,comment,4893452,4895594,2,0,dalke,,,"I'm listening to the series now. One of the oddities which struck me is how psychohistory could predict the microminiaturization of nuclear power cells. Nuclear power had been known for about 15,000 years, but only in the last 200 hundred was there a specific need by a resource-poor planet to figure out how to make those things, and so they did. Yet it was essential that those power plants exist in order to power the trade goods and the personal shields.<p>Sure, the Empire thinks in terms of large scale, but there's always a need for small, energy dense power systems. I can't figure out why they didn't exist already. And even if they didn't exist already, I don't see how psychohistory could have predicted that it would exist.<p>While on the other hand it makes the prediction that nothing will replace the standard jump technology for interstellar travel. If there were a way to go from Terminus to Trantor in, say, 1 jump instead of many, or if they could be done much faster, then the dynamics of the civilizations would also change in quite unexpected ways. There would be no ""edge"" of the galaxy, for example, since every planet would have about the same travel time to the other.<p>How can psychohistory make that prediction? More importantly, by the end of the original series, the ""Lens had performed a near-revolution in interstellar travel"", making hyperspace travel much faster. How could psychohistory predict that it would exist, much less when it would arise?<p>Either one of these - the lack of small nuclear power sources, or earlier creation of the Lens - would make big changes in the Foundation. And big enough changes that there's no way it would get to the same sort of semi-stable attractor as the alternative.",1355089062

When I relaunch I'll have to go through the same thought process as you, but first let me tell you what I've seen so far.<p>At my day job, I've run millions of dollars in paid user acquisition and lead gen. What you have to realize is that when you're paying for users, you're normally not going to get more dedicated users (simply interested people). Organic users are usually higher quality leads than users from paid user acquisition because they came to you as interested potential customers rather than you convincing them through marketing messages and a well thought-out and optimized landing page.<p>Paid acquisition can work really well for companies that have a high lifetime value for a customer (LTV). That's why you see ecommerce companies, for-profit colleges, insurance companies, and other similar high-priced products spending millions in the display, social, and SEM space.<p>Then you see the Groupons and Living Socials of the world going for a landgrab of users quickly (paying millions to acquire users at a moderate price). But that moderate price still might not back out as the category gets less sexy. You barely see ads on Facebook for these companies anymore because the cost of acquisition is simply too high.<p>If you're going to do paid marketing, you have to really know your business and how you will monetize your site/app to make some decent margin at the end (selling data, premium subscription, advertising, etc.). I would only use paid marketing to validate interest on a very small scale or as a  small push at the beginning to gain awareness.<p>If you're an app that requires a lot of users who will each monetize at a small amount, you need to have a stellar product with some other distribution mechanism (partnerships, viral coefficient greater than 1, unbelievable PR machine, etc.).",1355088864

Well, I guess Im just like a challenge ;-), but seriously, the company I work for has a need to have large numbers of machines to build and test the software we make.<p>There were plenty of discussions of Virtual environments and other Bare Motherboard/Google Datacenter-type solutions, but the fact is, the Apple EULA requires that Mac OS X run on Apple Hardware, since we are a software company we adhere to these rules without exception. These Mac Machines all run OS X in a NetBooted environment. We require Mac OS X because the products we make support Windows, Linux and Mac so we have data centers with thousands of machines configured with all 3 OSs running constant build and test operations 24 hours a day 365 days a year.<p>As for device failure, we treat these machines like pixels in a very large display, if a few fail, its ok, the management software disables them until we can switch them out. This approach allows us to continue our operations regardless of machine failures.<p>@bitbass I tried the vertical approach, but manufacturing the required plenum to keep the air clean to the rear machines cost too much for this project, but its not off the table for the next rack<p>@Kris Lee When I open the door I can literally watch the machine temps go up, but I can keep it open for 15-20 minutes before the core temps reach 180F<p>@Adam Ahhh..

Yet, no ordinary evidence is ever offered for these claims, let alone extraordinary evidence it would take to prove the claims.<p>Religion (and I'm referring to the three monotheistic ones, the three desert dogmas) are claiming that without this absolute divine supervision we would not know right from wrong.<p>So, if religion is just a way of life, and if you don't accept the required dogmas wholesale, in what way is it a guide for you? If you get to pick and choose out of all the required supernatural dogmas, does that not show that your morals in fact don't come from religion, but you already know what is good and what is right? Of course, morals and our civility to each other predate religion. We would not have gotten this far without it.<p>And seriously, believing something as absolute because it makes you feel good is a definition of delusion. Can you be any more dishonest with yourself? But some of us care about what is actually true.<p>And besides what religion you get indoctrinated into has nothing to do with the truthfulness of your particular religion, but more to do with where you were born, and the religion of your parents.",1355086918

Regardless of how different they might be in execution, their intended purposes have much more in common with each other than with C, Java, Fortran, or Haskell, to name a few.",1355086863

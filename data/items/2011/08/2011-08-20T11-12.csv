I'm going to share it anyhow:<p>I mostly judge by the negative reviews.  Reviews can be good or bad for ridiculous reasons.  It's easier for me to filter out the bad ridiculous reviews.  (UPS didn't arrive on time, item was the wrong shade of blue, etc.)<p>With the remaining bad reviews, I read to find out WHY they hated the product.  If the reasons are things I don't care about (toaster oven doesn't make eggs well) then there's probably nothing about the product I would hate.<p>I do read the good reviews, too, though.  Sometimes there's a good, but hidden, feature that trumps a bad feature.  (Toaster oven is perfect size for baking an RROD XBox 360.)   But this is pretty seldom.",1313841184

Your application (including the web server itself) gets compiled down to a single binary, but during development you can make changes and see them reflected on the fly without manually recompiling. This is my understanding based on an interview with one of the framework's developers; I haven't used it myself for any significant project, though I plan to.<p>Haskell in general meets a lot (though probably not all) of the author's requirements. Static type inference is great, and Haskell's system makes explicit type declarations completely optional except for in a handful of rare cases, though you will find yourself wanting to use them on most functions anyway because of how they clarify and improve the readability of your code. Testing is also dead simple with tools like QuickCheck--it essentially manufactures test cases for you based on invariants that you specify about your code.",1313840947

I use it with Emacs keybindings (CTRL-S for forward search, CTRL-R for backward search), but I'd imagine you can bind it to whatever keystroke you want.  There is no dialog, you simply hit CTRL-S (or whatever it is bound to), then start typing and it immediately goes to the next occurrence of what you have typed; you hit CTRL-S again to go to the next occurrence.<p>Incremental search changes the way you navigate text beyond using it for searches.  Want to move to particular place in the text file quickly without using the mouse?  Pick the most unique string near it and incremental search to move near it, then use regular keyboard movement commands to get to it (if the unique string itself wasn't where you wanted to be).",1313840677

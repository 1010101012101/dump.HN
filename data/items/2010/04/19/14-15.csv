This is fine for some purposes but can lead to problems if founders use their startup kits to fill out standard templates without taking proper precautions to protect their IP (by failing to capture it for the company), to protect their equity structure (by making sure that founders have to earn their equity over time), etc. In my experience, most of these situations work out without problems but it is wise to get an initial legal consultation in such cases to make sure that, if you take the attendant risks, you do so with open eyes.",1271688362

It is a property of human institutions that movement in some direction makes movement further in that direction more likely. Saying it will definitely happen is still fallacious, but saying it won&#x27;t make it more likely seems to ignore human tendencies in both individual and group decision-making.",1415095191

8555765,comment,8554996,8555437,0,0,lmm,,,"> A further objection is aimed ad the claim that &quot;we can be in a superposition&quot; and it is: &quot;If we can be in a superposition, why aren&#x27;t we aware of it?&quot;<p>Sounds rather like the fish being unaware of water. What would <i>not</i> being in a superposition feel like?<p>> Decoherence, for example, simply asserts that we cannot be aware of quantum effects except via interference phenomena. Why not? Why can&#x27;t we be directly conscious of the various incoherent components of the wavefunction in the same sense of directly that I am directly conscious of my cat sitting beside me? [1] I don&#x27;t have to do any fancy interferometry or statistical inference to be aware of the cat, so why do I have to mess about with statistics and interferometry to be aware of the wavefunction, given I myself am described by one?<p>So &quot;you&quot; is a quantum computer or something behaving like one, right? For you to &quot;be aware of&quot; a wavefunction, you&#x27;d have to causally interact with it. And that&#x27;s very hard because of e.g. the no-cloning theorem; all you can do is entangle a qbit in your head with the qbit you&#x27;re trying to measure, but what does that actually get you? What does that subjectively feel like? What operation would you expect to be able to perform that you can&#x27;t?",1415094701

Unaligned loads for 16B and 32B vectors can have slightly more of a slowdown when they cross 64B cachelines.  Unaligned stores across cachelines are somewhat worse, but usually not enough to really hurt you.<p>But <i>note bene</i>, unaligned vector stores that cross 4K pageline boundaries are so slow that they can destroy performance despite their rarity.  Here&#x27;s what the Intel Architecture Optimization Guide has to say:<p><pre><code>  11.6.3 Prefer Aligned Stores Over Aligned Loads
  There are cases where it is possible to align only a subset 
  of the processed data buffers. In these cases, 
  aligning data buffers used for store operations usually 
  yields better performance than aligning data 
  buffers used for load operations.

  Unaligned stores are likely to cause greater performance 
  degradation than unaligned loads, since there 
  is a very high penalty on stores to a split cache-line that 
  crosses pages. This penalty is estimated at 150 
  cycles. Loads that cross a page boundary are executed at 
  retirement. In Example 11-12, unaligned store 
  address can affect SAXPY performance for 3 unaligned 
  addresses to about one quarter of the aligned 
  case.

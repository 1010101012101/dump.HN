It is silly and thoughtless to pretend that if one is against terms of service on every service sale, that one is advocating no rights for businesses to enter into contracts. If you don't wish to be silly and thoughtless, then don't be.<p>The commercial code you point to is part of the framework of laws which form the social contract in the U.S., not something one explicitly signs off on every time they buy a good or service. Few people ever read such laws in anything other than summarized form. (If your rejoinder is ""well, you should"", which others have also pointlessly argued, don't bother, I refuse to entertain such thoughtless trash.) In that case, it's a background framework for every transaction, and shouldn't require supplementary pages of legalese on every service purchase.<p>You've merely redefined contract away from its accepted common usage into a legal nightmare that would drag commerce to a screeching halt. Yes, every transaction between two entities is trivially a contract, do you have anything more substantive to add?",1271426053

Our lawyer advised against doing such saying that the new UG (mini-GmbH, or literally ""entrepreneur company"") is a preferable form within Germany since it's very similar to the usual GmbH's structure and the authorities, accountants, etc. are familiar with such.<p>That said, there have been a number of successful German startups that were founded as UK Ltds, so it's obviously something that can be made to work.  What will be telling is seeing how many of those continue to emerge in the coming years now that the UG exists.<p>For investors, a UK Ltd is the safest bet because it's a form that virtually all investors and startup lawyers in Europe are familiar with.

Usually terms and conditions are tucked into a quiet corner so no one will ever find them. They're intentionally written in an almost unreadable style, even though it's not necessary. Some sites don't even have them, despite dealing with tons of user-submitted content. Stack Overflow has been claiming to license user-submitted content under cc-wiki since its inception <i>without ever asking users for this permission</i>. Stack Overflow cannot even legally <i>display</i> content from users without permission, yet they presume to license it out to third parties and even provide data dumps of it. People don't read terms and conditions because companies don't care. Stack Overflow has grown into one of the most popular sites on the web without ever settling the most fundamental legal issue related to the site. I've even emailed Stack Overflow about this. Their response can best be summed up as ""Huh?"" Companies only provide terms and conditions to cover their asses. They don't care what's in there any more than customers do.

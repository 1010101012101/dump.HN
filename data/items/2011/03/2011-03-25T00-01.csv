</code></pre>
A protocol is literally a standard or convention for communicating. In the case of twitter and facebook, the tools they provide for declaring social networks enables (arguably new) forms of social communication. Comparatively, SMTP, POP, HTTP, etc didn't require social scaffolding, or at least, it was not the central element. Without the social scaffolding, twitter and Facebook are useless; without social scaffolding, SMTP and POP still let me communicate with friends I already know.<p>(That being said, I would have preferred that Twitter was a distributed and open protocol from the start; however, I'm not going to switch to an open product just because it's open. I want the more accessible and wider cast social network.)",1301014792
2366701,comment,2364922,2366261,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Actually, it's more like this. Most CEOs aren't going to <i>start</i> R&D projects because (a) they'll pay off later, during a successor's tenure, and (b) vision can't be taught in MBA programs.<p>On the other hand, cutting the R&D projects and saying that ""unprofitable operations"" (even if they were profitable) were slashed will pop the stock price in the short term.<p>You're naive if you think CEOs don't have ways to benefit from temporarily popped stock prices even if their restricted shares can't be sold until much later. If they want to be a bit sleazy and secretly sell early, they can ask a spouse or sibling to short-sell or buy puts on the open market. Or they can use foreknowledge of the pop to hand one-day gains over to their friends. Illegal? Probably. (The reason I don't say ""yes"" is that insider trading has a technical meaning that most violations of the law's spirit don't meet.) Unethical? Yes. Likely to lead to jail time? No. Common as dirt? Yes.<p>It's pretty rare for people to commit insider trading violations for their own accounts, because it's easy to get caught. Instead, they tell their friends what is about to happen as a means of favor-trading. With that, it's pretty much impossible to get caught.<p>I don't think most corporate executives are malicious, so much as avaricious and narcissistic. Will they help their companies if it suits them? Yes. Will they hurt their companies if it suits them? Most of them will. The ""we are the nobility and you are the peasants"" mentality prevents most of them from caring too much either way about their companies; they care more about themselves, their friends, and maintaining their social class.",1301014791

Lately, it appears, (Though not verified.) that there isn't enough silver to actually meet the contracts held by people or institutions who want actual delivery. In the past, the speculators and huge banks would exit the fray before it became time to actually deliver the goods. However, rumor has it that the actual supply of real silver is so tight and the buyers (the longs) are sticking to the end, that the shorts cannot find metal to deliver and are paying off in cash.

Facebook has such a high value now because they have lock-in for their users; a user has a lot of Facebook friends and so can't make a unilateral decision to leave the platform and still have access to the value having their friends on the platform provides - and so that limits the threat to Facebook right now from competitors. However, there are still significant threats to Facebook longer term, and some of those threats could open Facebook up to threats from other firms with smaller costs that Facebook can't easily transition to compete with profitably long term.<p>Facebook therefore has very good prospects short term, but this position is still relatively precarious and the probability of maintaining as many users and as much revenue decreases progressively into the future - the probability of high revenues continuing after 50 years or even 20 is so low that it is not worth taking it into account when working out the intrinsic value of a share, and profits in the near future make up a much greater proportion of the total 'area under the integral' (i.e. future profits).<p>Formally: v = -E(L_{total}) = integral_0^infinity (integral_(-infinity)^infinity (l * P(L(t)=l)) dl) dt

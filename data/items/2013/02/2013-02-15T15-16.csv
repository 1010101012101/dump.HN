I never claimed that it is somehow impossible or prohibitively difficult to determine how things in Rails work - it is very possible and I do it myself all the time. What I claimed is that Rails has chosen abstraction over obviousness, and gave an example of a place where I believe that is demonstrated.<p>People usually inherit from AC::Base, not AC::Metal, which includes a number of modules, any of which may change the behavior of `params`.<p>You didn't take your expose far enough. As I mentioned in my post, `params` is an already-parsed representation of user data. You traced the call chain a couple of steps, but did not get to the point where parameters are actually parsed.<p>That's fine, I'm not at all interested in the specifics of how parameter parsing works, and I'm certain that you or I could go track it down when necessary. My point is only that it involves a number of layers of abstraction to get there - cataloging those layers is not a very compelling counterpoint.",1360943814

5226750,comment,5226076,5226076,2,0,programminggeek,,,"OUYA and Steam Box are going to make a dent, but it's going to be because of the economics of it more than anything else. Both Steam and OUYA are software that rely on companies like Apple, Samsung, nVidia, AMD, and Intel to spend billions of dollars on hardware R&D and they can just run their software stores on top of them. That makes the economics of putting out a box that hooks up to a TV and plays games a lot better.<p>For instance, with OUYA they can spend say $20-50 in parts to build the latest ARM box and turn around and sell it for $100. The total cost of R&D to design and build the OUYA is probably less than $10 million. There is already an existing pool of Android software with an average selling price of less than $5 a unit. It will probably launch with hundreds or thousands of games on day one. Compare that to the PS4 which will launch with probably 5-10 games and have maybe 100 games year one, and each game will cost $60 (or more).<p>OUYA - $100 + < $5 per game. \nPS4 - probably $400 + $60 per game.<p>OUYA - say $10 million to develop/produce\nPS4 - say > $1 billion to develop (PS3 CPU alone cost $2 billion to develop)<p>In short, the economics for both development of hardware and selling of software have shifted down so dramatically that it is going to hurt the PS4, XBox 3, and Wii U substantially. It already had a huge impact on the mobile space.<p>SteamBox is going to be basically the same story only at a $200-300 price point and with $5-20 games.<p>Why on earth would people (especially parents) pay $400 for a console and $60 for a game when they could pay $100 for a console and $5 for a game. You can buy a lot of OUYA games for the price of a next gen (or even current gen) console.<p>The market for $60 games won't go away, but it will shrink fast.<p>Linux is a big contributor obviously, but it's as much about the hardware economics as it is the software.",1360943797

5226683,comment,5218288,5225441,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>That's false</i><p>You're kidding, right? The choice Broder had was between driving on a freeway and driving through Manhattan. It was not in any way a choice between stop and go driving and steady-state driving at the same average speed.<p><i>Stop-and-go driving decreases the range of an electric vehicle</i><p>Compared to steady-state driving <i>at the same average speed</i>, yes. Compared to steady-state driving <i>at a significantly higher average speed</i>, not necessarily.<p><i>this is physics 101.</i><p>Okay, let's do some physics. The energy required to move a car through a distance D is F * D, where F is the force needed to push the car. For travel at a steady speed, F is given by the following equation:<p>F = c0 + c1 * v + c2 * v^2<p>where c0, c1, and c2 are constants that are determined by vehicle and environmental characteristics. (Briefly, c0 is the coefficient of friction between the tires and the road times the weight of the car; c1 is a (usually very small) constant related to the internal friction of rotating parts in the car; c2 is 1/2 rho Cd A, where rho is the air density, Cd is the car's drag coefficient, and A is the car's cross-sectional area. The key is that all of these things can be taken to be constant for the duration of the trip.)<p>For stop and go driving, F is given by the above formula times a constant e, where e is determined by the efficiency of regen; if e = 1 then regen is 100% efficient and all of the the vehicle's kinetic energy is reclaimed on each decel. If e > 1 then regen only captures a portion of the vehicle's kinetic energy, the portion being 1/e.<p>So if we compare stop and go driving at an average speed v1 to steady-state driving at an average speed v2, we have<p>E1 = F1 * D = e (c0 + c1 * v1 + c2 * v1^2) * D<p>E2 = F2 * D = (c0 + c1 * v2 + c2 * v2^2) * D<p>If we take v2 = 2 * v1, which is a conservative estimate for Broder's situation (25 mph average speed in the city vs. 50 mph average speed on the freeway), we have<p>E2 = (c0 + 2 * c1 * v1 + 4 * c2 * v1^2) * D<p>Now subtract to get the net energy difference:<p>E2 - E1 = [(1 - e) * c0 + (2 - e) * c1 * v1 + (4 - e) * c2 * v1^2] * D<p>Regen typically recaptures about 80 percent of a vehicle's kinetic energy, meaning e is about 1.25. So we have<p>E2 - E1 = [-0.25 * c0 + 0.75 * c1 + v1 + 2.75 * c2 * v1^2] * D<p>This is going to be positive for any vehicle except a heavy one with a low drag coefficient; practically no vehicles have that. So stop and go driving at 25 mph is going to save energy compared to steady state driving at 50 mph. This is the sort of calculation that I suspect was in the minds of the Tesla people when they told Broder that the stop and go segment in Manhattan was going to give him better range than driving on the freeway.",1360943103

I find the latter is more important than the former.<p>At my office most people get in around 9:30am to 10:00am, and leave around 8 hours later.  What I found was that I couldn't get any work done around that time because productivity slows down to a crawl in the middle of the day, usually due to meetings, figuring out what they need to do for the day, or the usual inter-cubicle communication.<p>I fixed this for myself by coming in early, around 7:00am.  That means I have approximately 2-2.5 hours of uninterrupted time when I have peak energy.  Then when everyone gets into the office I don't mind the interruptions.  Those are the pros.<p>The cons are that I have to wake up at 6am to drive into the office (~40mins drive).  As well, 8 hours from 7am is 3pm, but there's no way I can leave at that time without losing face.  Instead, I leave at 4pm.  I currently rationalize this extra hour of ""work"" by saying that I take a 1 hour lunch that I don't charge for.<p>Timeboxing myself into a 8-9 hour timespan means I really need to prioritize my work for the day.  Once the clock strikes 3:30pm, I make it a mission to take the next 30 minutes to wind down and prepare for the next day.

Next you'd need to reorganize the loop body so that e.g. memory reads for all iterations would occur at the start of the unrolled loop. This kind of optimizations can offer significant performance increases because you get more control over what the CPU is doing within the loop, but they also depend greatly on the target platform. Even different x86 processors can be very different in this respect, so unrolling can become a disoptimization easily.",1360942634

After Romero got fired, there was no one at id pushing for the studio to do much besides making games. Epic Games, on the other hand, took engine licensing very seriously from the beginning. There is a feeling of ""continuity"" between iterations of their technology, and this is very important to toolkit licensees, and something that you don't get from id. I've always felt that Tim Sweeney has a lot more business acumen than most people would expect from a programmer.",1360941829

You still have to think a little bit about concurrency issues, but if you are careful to use their thread safe structures, they have taken care of a lot of the harder parts for you. It is a neat model that just plays out pretty nicely.<p>Another cool product is Disruptor - they have figured out a good, fast way to do message passing that minimizes the need for concurrent data structures between worker threads. (Provided of course you can model your app in that way). Under the hood, they have some crazy dep memory barrier based stuff, but for most of the programmers on a team, thinking about that stuff is just not needed. (as an aside, I think if Beautiful Code 2 was being written, I think Disruptor should be included, that source code is downright inspiring.)<p>The point being, once you have a good, trusted and vetted set of primitives, and are willing to put a little effort into working in a paradigm someone else sets, you get a lot of benefit.

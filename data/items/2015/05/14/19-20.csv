But what is &quot;close?&quot; An alligator swimming right alongside the boat? Sure, that&#x27;s definitely too close. But what about an alligator on the riverbank, 100 yards away? Is that still too close? How about half a mile downstream? Again, I&#x27;ve never lived near gators, so I don&#x27;t have an intuition on what is and is not a dangerous situation.<p>Additionally, I feel like you&#x27;re forgetting that oft-repeated (and generally true!) maxim: &quot;They&#x27;re more afraid of you than you are of them.&quot;<p>Maybe the father in the story was being outrageously irresponsible. My gut tells me (and the story seems to intimate) that he knew what he was doing. That is, he probably intuited that the situation was low-risk.<p>To use a different dangerous animal, people have been killed by grizzly bears, yet tens of hundreds of thousands of folks annually camp out in the backcountry. Are they being irresponsible, just because their is a risk involved?",1431633588

9547225,comment,9545647,9546263,0,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"Error handling is not supposed to be fun.  It is hard.  It doesn&#x27;t stop being hard because you decided to hide it in the type signature.  Point by point:<p>> I wrote an RSS reader in Rust, and all the code required to compose all the error types (I/O, HTTP, XML, RSS, date formats) into a custom error type is as bulky as the modest amount of code that does the useful work....<p>If the errors are internal implementation details that you don&#x27;t want to expose (or you just don&#x27;t feel like writing wrappers), and you don&#x27;t want to handle them either, you can return `Result<T, Box<Error>`, as noted in the article.  This requires all of no work on your part as long as other libraries are also returning instances of `Error` (and in general, they are), while also ensuring that <i>your</i> library returns an instance of `Error`.<p>If your library defines its own meaningful errors, and you want to expose those to the user, then you will need to create a type and define `Error` for them, but you would also have to do the equivalent in any typed language with exceptions.  If you additionally want them to be &quot;top level&quot; errors, but want to wrap other types of errors as the ultimate cause, you&#x27;ll also need a single `From<Error>` implementation (from generic errors to your type) which in my experience is not even more code than a single catch-and-rethrow-as-another-type in a language with exceptions.<p>(I bring this up mostly for the benefit of others, as it has been explained to you before.  Perhaps when you wrote your library `Error` hadn&#x27;t been stabilized yet, but all of what I said above has been possible in Rust for many months now).<p>> Having to write all that error handling code up front is going to be a big problem for the Agile crowd. This may be a major drag on Rust adoption.<p>The &quot;Agile&quot; approach to error handling is `unwrap()`.  It&#x27;s not recommended in libraries because they violate the contracts the libraries expose, a problem they share with unchecked exceptions in other languages.<p>> All this error machinery is in Rust to avoid exceptions. That may have been a mistake.<p>Preferring sum types is not just true in Rust, where one might speculate that it&#x27;s because it lacks `catch`: my impression is that in all three of Haskell, Scala, and OCaml, which support both, public opinion has moved steadily away from exceptions and towards `Either` for error handling.  This is quite striking given that there are good reasons to believe that exceptions would be popular in those languages: in Haskell because pure code suffers from relatively fewer exception safety issues, in OCaml because the exception implementation is highly optimized, in Scala because the prevailing ecosystem (where most of the employees are drawn from) uses exceptions for error handling.  The fact that <i>all</i> of these communities, given both options, tend to use sum types, suggests to me that the theoretical benefits of this approach (many of which you covered) are also practical for many people.<p>> Exceptions have the good property that they can&#x27;t be ignored - if they&#x27;re not handled, you get a reasonable program termination.<p>In a recent paper, the following three things were found to have led to <i>35%</i> catastrophic production failures: <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-yuan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14...</a>:<p>> (i)the error handler ignores explicit errors; (ii) the error handler over-catches an exception and aborts the system; and(iii) the error handler contains “TODO” or “FIXME” in the comment.<p>It sounds like people do a fine job of ignoring exceptions.  Moreover, it seems to me like what you are advocating (catching `RuntimeError` or something equally generic, where you can&#x27;t possibly take an explicit corrective action, but not terminating the program) is precisely what ended up causing a lot of these bugs.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s not likely that you&#x27;ll out and out forget to handle a `Result` in Rust. You can&#x27;t even try to access the inner value without handling errors, and if you just don&#x27;t use it (because you don&#x27;t care about the value) Rust generates a warning (people generally pay attention to Rust warnings, since there are relatively few of them).  If you `unwrap()` it, it&#x27;s even easier to find where you aren&#x27;t handling your errors properly--you just grep for `unwrap()`.<p>In my experience, people ignore errors far <i>less</i> in Rust than in any other language I&#x27;ve worked with, because it actually makes them explicit when they happen, rather than propagating them down to a consumer who has no idea what to do with the error.<p>>  If there&#x27;s a reasonable exception hierarchy, you can catch an exception near the root of the tree and get all subsidiary exceptions.<p>I also am interested to hear why you believe that hierarchical error types make sense: errors seem to me to be one of the absolute worst fits for the classical inheritance model.  They <i>very</i> rarely have any shared behavior or state that isn&#x27;t also on `Error`, and trying to fit them into a hierarchy is an exercise in frustration that is undertaken for the sole purpose of avoiding multiple catch clauses--they very rarely compose and are even more rarely extensible.  More often, people just give up and use a single type with a String, or--equally commonly--simply `catch Exception` whenever they expect an exceptional condition to be raised without bothering to check the type at all.<p>> you have to combine error types yourself.<p>And coming full circle... no, you don&#x27;t :)<p>> I really want Rust to succeed, but I think they took a wrong turn with error handling.<p>You have repeated both this sentiment and the bulk of your comment in many, many posts now.  I believe that you are sincere in your desire for exceptions (even if I disagree with it), but I don&#x27;t think you or anyone else seriously believes that not making catchable exceptions the default error handling technique is going to make or break Rust adoption, especially when its primary target audience is known for routinely <i>disabling</i> exceptions to avoid dealing with exception safety and performance issues.",1431633500

I can&#x27;t engineer a solution for myself, but I will be fully conscious of the fact that my body is failing me. It&#x27;s terrifying, and you&#x27;re not alone.<p>I don&#x27;t have the right answers for you because I&#x27;m in a very similar position, but I can try to relieve parts of your existential anxiety. I used to think how crappy it was when you read on the news that some innocent bystander got shot or a freak accident occurred and someone died and how that could&#x27;ve been me. Ultimately, we should only worry about the things we have complete or partial control over. We are all susceptible to heart attacks, but we can also mitigate its probability through healthy diet and exercise. We are all susceptible to getting shot, but we can also mitigate its probability by choosing where we spend our time.<p>There will always be things we have no control over, but we should only concern ourselves with the things we do.<p>I would also recommend checking out &quot;A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy&quot;[1] by William B. Irvine.

I&#x27;ve tried reading eastern philosophy and various opinions on that, but they all seem like rationalozations of people trying to comfort themselves.<p>One thing I want to tell you - don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s something wrong with you because you are afraid of death. Many people cope by trying to convince themselves that &quot;death is okay, and may, in fact, be a good thing&quot;, and it all sounds deep and wise, but it doesn&#x27;t really make any sense. It&#x27;s okay to be scared/frustrated/angry when thinking about it.<p>From everything that I&#x27;ve read and thought about, I&#x27;ve concluded, that if we cut the shit and ignore all the pretentious philosophy and rationalizations, all it comes down to is &quot;try not to think about it and enjoy living your life right now&quot;.<p>When you are a kid you don&#x27;t think about death, but once you comprehend it it is shocking and depressing, but over time I guess you just get used to the thought, and learn to focus on work/friends/etc and enjoy the life that you have.<p>I think that humans will cure death eventually, and it makes sense to do everything in our power to fight it. I suggest you check out Eliezer Yudkowsky and the transhumanist community for a lot of interesting ideas on that(like cryonics).<p>Once you have done everything in your powers to avoid dying(healthy lifestyle, wise choices, etc, etc) - there&#x27;s no rational reason to keep thinking depressing thoughts, so you just learn to control your thoughts better, so that you wouldn&#x27;t ruminate on it pointlessly. It&#x27;s not a solution, but it&#x27;s the best you can do at this point.<p>I suggest learning meditation, so that you can learn to stop the scary and pointless thought patterns, and avoid upsetting yourself for no reason.<p>Find great books, fun hobbies, cool friends to have something fun to do instead of obsessing about depressing stuff.<p>Watch stand up comedy and great sitcoms, comedy is an <i></i>amazing<i></i> solution to this. Check out Louis CK and tv show Community. There&#x27;s something incredibly beautiful about comedy, if things get bad it really saves my sanity, can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.

9547176,comment,9546382,9547047,0,0,eridius,,,"Further commentary:<p>> <i>When Rust was originally announced, the team had ambitions to pursue the multi-core MacGuffin with a green-threaded actor model, but they found out that it’s very hard to do green threads with native code compilation.</i><p>It&#x27;s easy to do if you&#x27;re willing to define certain synchronization points (such as I/O). IIRC, Rust abandoned Green threads because of a few reasons:<p>1. It doesn&#x27;t play well with FFI. This is particularly true with segmented stacks, but Rust abandoned those before it abandoned green threading. With regular OS-provided stacks, FFI is a problem because the FFI call can&#x27;t yield to the green scheduler.\n2. It has an unavoidable performance problem even for code that doesn&#x27;t use it. The existence of green threading means the entire runtime needs to be abstracted over a threading and I/O interface. This is a lot of complexity, and requires the use of dynamic dispatch for a lot of things that would otherwise be static dispatch. Rust originally switched to native as the default threading model but kept green threading as an option for a while, but this violates the concept of you-don&#x27;t-pay-for-what-you-don&#x27;t-use, especially since most people weren&#x27;t even using green threading anymore.\n3. It also made implementing some things very awkward. For example, because of the abstract notion of a runtime, you couldn&#x27;t really implement selection over multiple file descriptors very well. Things like that must be handled by the runtime library or not at all, because for native threading you&#x27;d want to use select() (or kqueue or epoll) but for green threading the green threading library needs to deal with that. In Go, the standard solution there was to spawn multiple green threads that each block on one fd and communicate using channels (because the runtime can then collect all the blocked fds into a single select/kqueue/epoll), but that&#x27;s unwanted overhead, and is especially not very good when you&#x27;re not using the green threading.\n4. Green threads encourage the use of lots of short-lived threads that have very shallow stacks. Rust abandoned segmented stacks with the understanding that the OS-provided virtual memory support was good enough that it didn&#x27;t matter if every thread got an 8MB stack as it would allocate pages on-demand. But a 4k page for every green thread can be a lot of overhead if you&#x27;re using thousands of green threads. You can of course explicitly request a smaller stack, but that&#x27;s tricky to get right (if you request too little you explode). There was a lot of thought given to trying to statically determine how much stack space a given function call required (which is not always possible, and is especially tricky if there&#x27;s any recursion) to deal with this, but that&#x27;s a very hard problem.<p>Ultimately, it was determined that green threads simply weren&#x27;t worth all the costs. The OS is pretty good about dealing with lots of threads, and arguably it&#x27;s actually better than the green threading library is about scheduling them all. Green threading makes some sense if you want to spawn 10,000 simultaneous threads, but in nearly all real-world workloads it&#x27;s just not really worth it.<p>> <i></i>Rust has taken up a different challenge: eliminating crashes from otherwise traditional, “boring” multi-threaded programs. In the sense that Rust has abandoned its original vision in favor of pursuing more modest and achievable goals*<p>I find this an odd thing to say. Statically eliminating crashes (and data races) without a garbage collector or any performance penalty is actually <i>significantly more interesting</i> than actors. Rust did not decide to pursue the more modest &quot;boring&quot; goal, it redoubled its focus on pursuing the very hard (but achievable) and very important goal of solving the problem of memory/data safety in multithreaded programs. This aspect of Rust is what most excited me when I first got involved 2 years ago and what still excites me to this day and makes me wish I could use Rust in my day job.<p>> <i>For the record, the Nim language manages to get this right, and the Rust folks might look to it for inspiration.</i><p>I&#x27;ve heard of Nim before but haven&#x27;t actually looked at it. Does it attempt to solve memory/data race safety at compile-time like Rust does?<p>> <i>It is also worth noting that processing non-overlapping slices in parallel is destined to come into mortal conflict with The Iterator, which is by its nature sequential</i><p>I don&#x27;t think this is true. You can build an Iterator that yields non-overlapping mutable slices, and then you can process them in parallel. The iterator is sequential, yes, but you can call it multiple times and hand the resulting references to your parallel computations (as opposed to handing the iterator itself over, which doesn&#x27;t work because you&#x27;d be sharing mutable state without a lock and Rust does not allow you to write that code).<p>Although it&#x27;s worth noting that at the moment you can&#x27;t do fork-join concurrency (so you can&#x27;t share mutable slices with parallel computations like that unless you cheat with `unsafe`). There&#x27;s `thread::scoped()` but it&#x27;s marked as unstable (so you can&#x27;t use it from Beta or from tomorrow&#x27;s Stable 1.0) because it has a serious safety issue, and the proposed replacements are still being worked on.",1431632858

You are part of this structure... you do not have infinite time extent, but neither do you have infinite space extent, and that&#x27;s fine.

So the call stack is f -> g -> h.<p>Suppose that h() returns to g() with an error condition. Per your description, it now returns to f() with the error condition, rather than continuing. f() in turn returns with the error condition, because the function it called had an error.<p>The only way I can read your suggestion is a distinction between errors caused during a subroutine call, and errors caused directly in the body of the current function (like a divide by zero or something). But these errors are quite rare; most code is composed of calls to other code. So I&#x27;m not sure what error you could have that causes immediate return which is also distinct from a the error-case for return value of the function.",1431632366

9547047,comment,9546382,9546382,0,0,eridius,,,"It&#x27;s always interesting to see the experiences of new people to Rust. There&#x27;s a few curious misconceptions in here that I hadn&#x27;t seen before:<p>> <i>Iterators are a great and reusable way to encapsulate your blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, but of course they’re impossible to optimize.</i><p>I&#x27;m very curious to know where you got this idea from. Iterators actually optimize very well, in most cases being indistinguishable from a manual imperative for-loop. If you forget to turn on compiler optimizations then you&#x27;ll see a significant performance difference, but that&#x27;s true for a lot of different things you might want to do. Compiler optimizations are important whenever you&#x27;re measuring performance.<p>> <i>pragma</i><p>It&#x27;s not a pragma. It uses the same # sigil that C compilers use to introduce pragmas, but in Rust, it actually denotes an attribute which modifies the next item (or in the enclosing item with the #! syntax). This is used for a number of things. As you&#x27;ve seen, it can be used to automatically derive implementations of traits, and it can be used to mark a function as being a candidate for inlining, among other things.<p>> <i>Rust rather inelegantly overloads the assignment operator to mean either binding or copying.</i><p>This is indeed a very curious misconception. Assignment actually isn&#x27;t overloaded like that at all. In your code example, when you say<p><pre><code>  let y = x;\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;re not binding y to the value of x, you&#x27;re actually <i>moving</i> the value of x into y. There is no implicit bind-by-reference in Rust. If you want a reference, you need to use the & sigil.<p>The confusion here stems from the fact that some values can be <i>copied</i> and some values cannot. When you move a value in Rust, if the value can be copied (if it conforms to the Copy trait), then the original value is still usable after the move. This means you can say<p><pre><code>  let x = 1;\n  let y = x;\n  let z = x;\n</code></pre>\nThe line `let y = x` moves the value of x into y, but since the value is copyable, it&#x27;s really just moving a copy of the value. In this context, &quot;copyable&quot; basically means memcpy() can be used to produce a valid copy. There&#x27;s a different trait called Clone which has an explicit .clone() method that is used for values that require additional work beyond memcpy() to copy.<p>In your code example, your struct is not Copy, so moving its value makes the original value <i>inaccessible</i>. Basically, it&#x27;s considered garbage memory and cannot be read from again. This is why your code<p><pre><code>  let x = MyValue::Digit(10);\n  let y = x;\n  let z = x;\n</code></pre>\nthrows an error. It isn&#x27;t because `y` and `z` would be referring to the same value, it&#x27;s because after the line `let y = x;` the original value `x` is garbage.<p>So really, any time you do assignment like that (or any time you pass a value as an argument to a function) without taking an explicit reference (using &), you&#x27;re doing a move. Values that confirm to Copy will move a copy of the value, and all other values will leave the original value inaccessible. This should actually be familiar to people coming from C++, where values that aren&#x27;t Copy are basically like std::unique_ptr, except that instead of leaving the original value with a known-&quot;zero&quot; state, the compiler prevents you from accessing the original value at all.",1431631430

9547005,comment,9545701,9545701,0,0,deadgrey19,,,"Academic publishing is a conversation between academics. No one paper is truly authoritative and only with time will the highly cited well regarded contributions make themselves known within the academic community (and eventually outside of it too). The time horizon between publication and &quot;impact&quot; for most academic work is usually (or should be) in the range of 10-20years. In the rush for funding and &quot;impact&quot; university PR machines (and scientists too) are forced to make flashy statements about the latest new sensational, tenuous at best implications of their findings. Boring, rigorous, incremental work has no place in a media driven funding cycle. This is a real problem and one we need to think about how to resolve.<p>Having said that, scientists are not perfect either. As an author, problems of honesty and reproducibility in science trouble me greatly. That&#x27;s why on our recent papers (<a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/qjump/pubs/2015-nsdi-qjump.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/qjump/pubs/2015-n...</a> and <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/musketeer/pubs/2015-eurosys-musketeer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/musketeer/pubs/20...</a>) my coauthors and I have gone out of our way to make the original unprocessed data sets and detailed experimental descriptions easily available. If you take a look inside of our papers, you&#x27;ll find that all of the substantial figures in the papers are clickable giving direct access to original datasets on our websites. Although not perfect, this is a start down the road of more easily testable and reproducible work. To our great surprise, only a few weeks after publication we&#x27;ve already got requests from people trying to reproduce the results in different environments. This suggests to me that this kind of approach both can work, and really should become the minimum standard in academic publishing.",1431631022

Hacker News offers that in the settings.<p>- I really would like to test out your pro themes, but I don&#x27;t want to pay the full price for testing it. How about you let us use all these themes for the top story (i.e. only for one story). If I like the themes, I&#x27;ll buy pro because I want to have it for all stories.

What would an evolved Excel look like?<p>Take cell-based formulas for example. For all their benefits, there are a few obvious issues with cell formulas in Excel.<p>First, it&#x27;s not always obvious where they are. You can have formulas all over an Excel spreadsheet and it&#x27;s not easy to tell at a glance where they are, so you don&#x27;t know what parts of your spreadsheets are static and which parts are dynamic.<p>Second, formulas can become unwieldy very quickly. Whilst Excel formulas are very Lisp-like, the lack of user-defined functions within Excel (you can do it other ways) means you often have large nested functions or resort to suboptimal methods like storing intermediate steps of a calculation in other cells to keep the formulas manageable. The language constructs aren&#x27;t designed to enable semantically-rich yet succinct formulas, though occasionally there are useful tricks to extend beyond what is immediately obvious (such as the ways SUMPRODUCT has been twisted beyond its original purpose). You want to encourage elegant creativity, rather than relying on arcane tricks.<p>Lastly, plenty of scope to improve performance.<p>All three of these issues above are very much solvable, would allow non-professional-programmers a far nicer tool to work with, whilst unlocking more of their creativity and the potential of the machines they&#x27;re using.

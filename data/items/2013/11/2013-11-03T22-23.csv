I am well aware its a social faux pas to wear a sweater or two, and maybe warm sweatpants instead of designer jeans.  Or a hoodie.  But given the choice of death by hypothermia or wearing two sweaters at the same time, I think the average poor dude would wear two sweaters, regardless of what a temporary tourist would do.

6665505,comment,6664555,6664829,3,0,derefr,,,"> ...to do whatever you need<p>I think that&#x27;s a distinction that the author&#x27;s language made. <i>Most</i> programming problems have been solved. The head of the Zipf-curve of your work, no matter the domain, will be reusing old-hat knowledge. Every program, even HFT, needs proper data structures, algorithms, task scheduling, etc. Hopefully this stuff is mostly already provided by your platform, but a great majority of every developer&#x27;s time is basically &quot;bringing the platform up-to-snuff&quot; with everything it really should have had to begin with.<p>Once <i>that&#x27;s</i> done, the code that&#x27;s actually business-domain specific (whether the domain is ERP, trading, games, graphics, AI, simulation, etc.) will likely be novel, because it&#x27;s a codification/automation of a business process which is itself novel. (And business processes being novel is sort of the Anthropic argument of capitalism: a perfectly non-novel process means there&#x27;s already a company doing it somewhere with lead-time on you, which means you have no advantages and won&#x27;t survive in the market. So every new business that survives must have some sort of mutation, for better or worse.)",1383519184

But denying source until he gets a 5 star that&#x27;s just absurd. If it was me I would of first made sure all of this convo happened in Elance workroom and then get Elance into it (yeah it would take longer for them to resolve but he would get his files) and then right a lengthy review for this developer to make sure that no one else has this problem.<p>I guess that&#x27;s just what you have to deal with when using bidding sites.

The Company currently represents 50,000+ channels, and delivers 1.5 billion video views per month. Maker has an established reputation for guiding content creators in maximizing views and courting brands. Additionally, the Technology group within Maker innovates with world-class web engineering and design practices to produce high-quality apps and tools that connect content with eyeballs and usher content creators to new levels of mastery.<p>What does Maker build? We develop talent-facing web applications at high scale that connect YouTube content creators with each other, with our channel-management pros, and with tech such as ad optimization and alternative distribution targets. We also build internal web apps, APIs, and a handful of public-facing video/content sites for our top talent. Here are some of the technologies we use:<p><pre><code>  - Backend: Node/Express, Python/Django,, Ruby/Rails, NginX
  - Frontend: CoffeeScript, Jade/Less/Sass/Stylus, Ember/Angular/Knockout, D3, WebGL
  - Testing: CircleCI, Cucumber, Mocha
  - Deployment: Capistrano, Fabric, Dotcloud, AWS, CloudFlare
  - Virtual Machines: Vagrant, Docker
  - SQL: Mysql, RedShift / Postgres
  - NoSQL: Redis, Memcache, MongoDB, Neo4j, Hive/Hadoop, Cassandra/Riak
  - Linux: Bash/Shell scripting
</code></pre>
Want more reasons to work at Maker? The engineering environment is exceptional. Maker&#x27;s CTO is a computer scientist himself who still codes regularly, and we have a very programmer-friendly workplace:<p><pre><code>  - You decide the technology.  The engineer who&#x27;s writing the code has
    the final vote on which technologies get used. We use APIs to cross-
    connect our projects with ease, which also enables us to use
    different languages in different projects.
  - Flexible work hours.  Come in as early or late as you want, as long
    as your total hours are on par with your peers; what really matters
    is the quality and quantity of your code commits.
  - Code intelligently.  We hack, but we also care about sharing code
    with each other, so we talk about readability and complexity, we
    develop all modules as though they&#x27;ll one day be open-sourced, and
    we believe in small tools used cleverly, at scale.
  - Open Source friendly.  Besides using mostly open-source tools, we&#x27;ve
    open-sourced several internally developed tools on
    https://github.com/MakerStudios/, and more are coming.
  - Great benefits.  We have amazing investors and we want healthy,
    enthusiastic employees, so we offer our engineers a highly
    competitive salary, top-notch health/dental/vision coverage,
    401(k), and stock options.

Here&#x27;s what I gather:<p>1. 4 year medical school during which one learns about the panoply of human medicine. You come out of med school with an MD.<p>2. 4-5+ year general surgery residency (depends on program and optional steps one might take such as research years) during which one learns general surgical procedures through observation, assistance, and practice in the operating room under the supervision of experienced attending surgeons. Generally, residents will rotate through different surgical departments in order to gain broad exposure to the various fields and techniques. Residents take a yearly standardized exam called the ABSITE and are also evaluated by the attending surgeons they have worked with. More senior residents are given more responsibility in patient care and will be given more opportunity to assist and perform in the OR.<p>3. After residency, one can further specialize by taking on a fellowship (2-3 years, but could be more depending on specialty). During fellowship, one focuses even further on a specific field. Fellowship is an additional layer of practical hands-on training.<p>4. Practice - after fellowship, one would go on the join a surgical group or create a private practice to perform surgery commercially.<p>Throughout all of this is a series of examinations that are given which, in total, will allow a surgeon to practice unsupervised on patients.<p>Edit: to point out where the MD is earned and vague mention of licensure",1383516849

I try to come off as informal as possible, as if I was writing to an old friend.<p>- I approach from a place of learning instead of selling. I think people, myself included, don&#x27;t like being sold to, but like to help a fellow human being out. The fun and exciting thing is that if you hit on the interview with the right problems and solutions, you&#x27;ve pretty much sold them.<p>- I put a timeframe on my ask, &quot;30 minute coffee&quot;, etc.<p>- Adding your social identity seems to help. I add a link to my LinkedIn profile in my signature. I can only imagine that this adds credibility and many people I email will ask to connect with me on LinkedIn.<p>- Referrals get high responses. Not really a cold email, but the technique of having a subject line of &quot;Referred by X&quot;, gets a high response rate. I only do this if I was really given a referral by someone.<p>- Be short and sweet. I&#x27;m not a very verbose person as it is, but I think people will tend to read your emails if they&#x27;re short.<p>I haven&#x27;t done any cold calls yet, when I do, I would approach it in a similar way.

So when I played Fantasy sports I found myself too often rooting against my team when it came to getting fantasy points. It started to kill all the fun from watching the game.<p>So last year I stepped back and didn&#x27;t play FFB. First season I was able to enjoy without the extra stress of competing in 5 years. This year I didn&#x27;t play and once again I am enjoying the game more. So I don&#x27;t think I am going back.

It&#x27;s about as hassle-free as Ubuntu. Ubuntu does have some useful PPAs, but if you pick the right version, you can just add an Ubuntu PPA to Debian and it will work.<p>I could live without some of the political aspects of Debian (there&#x27;s no Firefox in the default repos???), but they are really just minor hassles. Import a couple PPAs, and you are rolling.<p>For those of you looking for an alternate distro, my shortlist was Debian Testing and Arch Linux.

They are career-track professionals. They are box checkers. They are bullet-point collectors. A lot of them are extremely smart, and the ones from the top-tier programs are among the hardest working sons of bitches you&#x27;ll ever meet. These were the kids who ground their asses off in high school and undergrad, and who will (generally) land lucrative, but safe careers continuing to apply the same grind-and-optimize strategies that got them through school. They do well in regimented, structured environments where there are frameworks, processes, known inputs, etc. They flourish in career tracks that resemble academic environments: where there are &quot;grades,&quot; tracks, clear progression, etc.<p>A lot of engineers are the exact same way, for what it&#x27;s worth. They don&#x27;t have a monopoly on risk-taking any more than MBAs have a monopoly on risk aversion. Nevertheless, as a general rule, an MBA is not a degree one pursues if one is seeking risk or adventure (and I&#x27;d argue that the same could be said of <i>any</i> master&#x27;s degree).<p>I&#x27;d almost require an MBA of a CFO, COO, or CEO that I&#x27;m bringing on board to scale up a business or take the helm of a mature business. But I would be a little uneasy about an MBA&#x27;s founding a tech startup from the ground up. That&#x27;s not to say that MBAs can&#x27;t do the latter, or are necessarily good at the former. But there&#x27;s a correlation. (MBAs are perfectly capable of starting non-tech businesses, however, and often do. But to found a tech startup, the MBA would really need to be technical to a high degree.)<p>A startup founder needs to be risk-seeking, and to whatever extent he or she has collected a bunch of degrees, that&#x27;s a pattern of risk-averse behavior. It&#x27;s an indicator. I still think such a person could make a great fit working <i>at</i> a startup, provided the entitlement issue isn&#x27;t there (which it really is for a lot of folks, owing in large part to the expense of the degree). But as a founder? I&#x27;d be a little leery.<p>MBA programs are changing these days, and it needs to be said. A lot of them are adopting Lean Startup methodologies, or refocusing on innovation, or encouraging and teaching entrepreneurship (to whatever extent the latter can be taught, which I&#x27;d guesstimate to be maybe 50-60%). Today&#x27;s MBAs are not your grandfather&#x27;s MBAs. They&#x27;re not the 1990s tech-bubble MBAs, either. Nevertheless, a lot of them are not risk takers.<p>The ones who are? Give them a fair shot. You&#x27;d be surprised. They are incredibly smart, well trained, quantitatively analytical, and make great marketers, biz dev & corp dev types, CFOs, and operations managers. Few of them walk into startups expecting $200k + signing bonus + equity the way they might have 20 years ago. That stereotype is out of date. But if a well-qualified candidate shows up at your door with realistic expectations about the job, the title, the compensation, and so forth: I see nothing wrong there. He or she has self-selected out of entitlement issues. (On the flip side, spotting the entitled ones -- MBAs or otherwise -- is fairly easy.)",1383516029

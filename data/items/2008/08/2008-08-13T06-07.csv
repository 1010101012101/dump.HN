Some people aren't content to just vote, they have to impose their will on others.<p>There's nothing wrong with mixing in a little humor. It's been awhile since I read PG's guidelines, but I don't remember a ban on it. I don't think your joke broke the bounds of civility. It's a little blue for sure, but not NSFW.<p>A joke here and there (even an off-color one) is FAR from turning this site into Reddit or Digg. I started surfing those for the first time a week or two ago just to see why everyone here complains about them, and wow is this site worlds apart (in a good way). I was actually shocked at how Reddit links are often so editorialized that I can't even guess what will be there when I click through.",1218609622

274776,comment,274624,274732,0,0,iigs,,,"Yeah. Sorry about that. I generally revise my comments if they're too confrontational, negative, or inane. That one was set up perfectly, though. I fully expected to come back to my computer to find my first net-negative comment.<p>FWIW, this was my second highest comment and second most replied-to comment since I joined. In both dimensions this comment lost to my first comment which 1) was a reply to PG, 2) invoked the ""hi i just registered here"" sympathy upmod and 3) invoked ""boo reddit/digg"" sentiment in this parenthetical comment:<p><i>(I'm a recent reddit lurker, and as reddit continues to become digg my clicks seem to be heading elsewhere)</i><p>So, I agree with you fundamentally, but it looks like that's not how things are going to play out, if my first lets-be-a-jackass comment scored so well.<p>Perhaps there's some middle ground?<p>Everyone has their limit, but I'm not offended by a little risque humour (obviously), and it doesn't seem inappropriate for the site so long as it's not explicit or vulgar. My primary beef with reddit is that as an ""all things to all people"" site the front page is filled O LOOK A LOL CAT ITS A CAT WITH FUNNY WORDS [pic], and the comment threads are filled with semi-predictable reply chain puns.<p>I'd love to read consensus (esp PG comments) for style guidelines for this site. I'm a geek and a trendy comp-sci field dabbler, but I'm not building a startup, despite my desire to be an entrepreneur, and I'm definitely not in Y Combinator, so I have a pretty good idea where my opinion lays in the grand scheme of things here.<p>All articles being about tech/hacker interest seems 100%+ sensible. If the style guidelines are ""No empty humor comments, period. Startups are Serious Business."" Then perhaps I haven't found the right community fit for myself (hey look a startup idea!).",1218609129
274775,comment,274090,274090,0,0,albahk,,,"The issues with virtual currencies are not technical, rather it is a social issue of trust.  You trust that a $100 note will be accepted and exchanged for goods or services according to the note's face value in the general economy.  This is backed up by laws and businesses must accept this as payment, hence ""legal tender"".  So, our economies can function by exchanging these notes instead of each of us carrying around three pigs, a sack of wheat and some chickens to pay for goods and services.<p>I would never take my universally accepted ""legal tender"" and convert it into a less liquid form of currency that is not universally accepted in the economy, that is backed only by a company and not by law.<p>Even if it could get universal acceptance and was backed/supported by law, it would then be the same as our current system of currency, so why bother?<p>I have had hundreds of thousands of frequent flyer points disappear due to an airline collapse.  This would be my biggest fear of adopting any virtual currency.",1218609102

Maybe consider relaxing and enjoying life a little more, rather than attempting to impose your vision of what the site should be upon everyone else.",1218608656

274768,comment,274730,274730,0,0,SingAlong,,,"That's a real breakthrough. Now we are real close to see someone building an artificial human.<p>But I got this thought(may sound silly). Now since artificial humans should be able to think a lot. That would imply a lot of processing, which means the electronic components would generate a lot of heat. This artificial skin is said to be able to handle heat. So to get rid of excess of heat(more than the amnt the skin can handle), there needs to be a method to handle the excess. The two ways i can imagine... By having a fan or heatsink like in a computer or by storing the heat and using it to power further processes. For the second method it would be better to accommodate the storage area in the skin itself. That would reduce the size of the artificial human(and make it look more like a human, since having a bump else where in the body would look odd).<p>[ disclaimer: just my thoughts over tea ]",1218607930

The average person stays about 2 years in a job, and they go thru about 10.5 jobs before age of 40.<p>Most people get married once or twice in their lifes, and expect their marriage to last forever.  Nobody expects that from a job.<p>You might want to equal getting a job with dating and sleeping with a new girl, but not getting married  ;)",1218607813
274766,comment,274624,274624,0,0,lsc,,,"body shops offer a degree of protection from contractors who later decide to sue for employee status, but I don't think that makes them worth it.  I mean, your liability there is usually less than 50% of what you paid for the guy (if the government thinks you were paying an employee as a contractor, you have to pay the employer portion of SSI and unemployment insurance and other benifits, for the entire time the guy worked for you.)  It's bad, but that's about what most body shops charge, and it's fairly rare for a contractor to come back and sue for employee status-  but even if you had to pay those fees for every employee, I think you are still coming out ahead doing it yourself over paying the body shop.<p>I've not met one headhunter who was capable of distinguishing between someone who is technically good and someone who is not.  Granted, it's a hard problem-  but it also requires a whole lot of domain specific knowledge.   Knowledge that headhunters usually don't have.",1218607774

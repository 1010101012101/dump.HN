Business people respect things like stock prices and profit reports, and ever since Apple rose to being the largest tech company, there's been a certain mentality that ""they make the most money so they must be doing it right"".

You can work at a job 8 hours a day and hate it while the guy next to you does it for 12 hours a day and loves it. You might end up ruining your quality of life and he won't be. So you can't quantify your quality of life with time spent at work.<p>But even considering that there is probably a strong correlation; fortunately there is also a very natural balancing mechanism. If work long hours is really ruining your life then that's a direct incentive for you to not do it. You have a constant pressure to not overwork yourself because you it psychologically make you feel horrible and no one wants to feel horrible. So things sorta tend to balance themselves out. Even if you look at environments/careers were people really push themselves due to competitiveness in the long term I don't think they end up having shorter or worse lives.<p>Sure there are masochists that work 12 hours a day, hate it, but do it for the promotion; but even for them I think in their minds they don't have a horrible life. The prospect of the promotion prolly keeps them happy and keeps them going.<p>Now compare that with taking a pill or zapping your brain:\nIf you take a pill and you get dementia 40 years later then you're trading in current gains for future pains. You're not getting constant negative feedback to hold you back. So to keep up with your peers you and all the people around you will be popping every pill possible because otherwise you drop out of the race.<p>Now since there are no brakes to the process and everyone is trashing their bodies to make it to the top your society eventually ends up with a group of super smart pill-poppers and brain zappers and they become all the CEO and PhDs but live to only 40 before their brains are fried and then you've got the rest that live to 90 and clean toilets.",1327898208

If you go to the gym and do heavy squats at 6:30pm without eating anything since your lunch at 11:00am you are going to feel like absolute shit afterwards. Post-workout nutrition is essential for building muscle and recovery, but making sure to eat a mix of complex carbs, protein, and fat ~1 hour before you workout makes a world of difference for how you before during, and feel after your workouts. If your diet is sound though, and working out still makes you feel so terrible that you don't wish to do it (I'm not talking muscle soreness or the usual reasons people find to not workout) you should definitely consult with a nutritionist or dietitian as something else may be going on.",1327897913

That's the situation with cars. They are overwhelmingly used in cities, not offroads or on road trips, and car companies know that and design cars for the common use case. I am not sure how to quantify this, and I don't have any literature offhand on it. But perhaps you'd like to compare a luxury sedan to a military vehicle that really is designed for offroad terrain? I don't think I have the burden of proof here, either; I'd be happy to learn of any evidence you have that cars really are designed for long trips. Just because a car <i>can</i> be used for long trips doesn't mean it was optimized for that purpose, and Derek states that cars are over-engineered without any other justification.<p>""Cars Kill Cities"" assumes that environmental friendliness and space are the most important criteria when choosing a method of transportation.

Really? When was the last time you had a query like this in a web app?)<p>I write web applications in the financial analysis sector, and the general technique of writing queries where subqueries must be composed together to combine groups of coarse-grained sets into an ever more specifically narrowed down set is very common - we do reporting of a fairly complex temporally-oriented schema and we can throw up bar charts and excel spreadsheets right up on the client, straight from the DB, without loading intermediary objects into memory or anything like that.  The queries are highly composed, we're using aggregates to flatten out sets, then joining to that, we're using window functions in some cases, and we can do it all straight in the ORM with not a literal scrap of SQL anywhere.   When the dataset grows from 1000 rows to 1000000 we'll be able to scale since we're using the relational database as it was meant to be used.<p>I learned how to write those kinds of queries when I worked at MLB.com.  There, we wrote scripts that generated all kinds of elements of the homepage and article pages, reams of baseball stats, game wrapups, schedules - again all pulled straight from a really, really vast schema spreading over three databases.   Before I worked at MLB I barely knew what a join was.<p>Looking through my source here, I just counted nine such queries just in two source files related to reporting alone.   If you come out to Pycon this year, come find me and I can show you some of what I do.<p>Obviously the example in my post/talk had to be contrived since I couldn't exactly put up code from work.

So even with print books, if they're print on demand (aka digital short-run), the whole question of inventory write-down is irrelevant because there isn't any inventory.

The only downside is that the only way I know of to secure it is SSH tunneling...someone should come up with a way to do Redis over TLS.",1327896168

At least they tried to buy the technology before building it in-house, which is more than what most companies do.<p>Apple has run out of businesses a lot of companies by stealing their ideas outright and shipping them as part of MacOS (Konqueror widgets, Spotlight, etc...).",1327896135

I'm not going to put my startup in the Dropbox 'successful' bucket quite yet, but our multiple 'Ask HN' posts helped mold IActionable into what it is today.<p>Its really interesting to look back and see how our company was formed by the feedback we received. Early on we had one idea which we called 'KaBadge' and we asked what everyone thought here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=795952"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=795952</a><p>This made us discover an even bigger need. Before people were going to think about karma/badge/point portability they were going to need systems to help award them. We switched gears really quick and went to work. It look a bit of time to convince ourselves that it would be possible. This was way before someone tossed out the term <i>'gamification'</i> so it was really hard to do any research on this new market.<p>Then we came back to the community with IActionable: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1126780"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1126780</a><p>Unfortunately at that time there was no way we could have moved to California to be part of YC. (families, babies, mortgages, etc) But, we were lucky enough to discover a local (Utah) incubator back in 2010. Eventually my friend and I convinced ourselves to quit our jobs: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1347464"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1347464</a><p>We quickly raised a seed round after the program and haven't looked back. Things are definitely still evolving but its been an awesome roller-coaster ride so far.",1327896072

I think that a chemical analyser in everyone's phone would be very useful for example in detecting toxic substances in consumer products (e.g. cadmium in cheap jewelry). Would it be able to do that? A second application that comes to mind is to improve recycling by allowing people to scan the items they are throwing away.<p>Could it also do anything related to measuring contaminants in air or water? I live by the Baltic sea, which is very badly eutrophied, and have for some time had the idea of a network of floating sensors that would measure with high detail the nutrient levels. If one could pinpoint sources down to individual agricultural fields, I think huge reductions in fertilizer runoff would be possible.",1286790971
1779268,comment,1777665,1778586,0,0,Mz,,,"Here are two rules that I took from a quality forum I once belonged to which have their merits:<p><pre><code>  1) Speak from firsthand personal experience.
  2) Or cite your sources.
  (3) or both)

My view is that you really should not be aiming to put certain individuals on a pedestal.  You should be aiming to foster an environment with a high level of quality of conversation.  If you put too much emphasis on specific members, that only makes it more likely that it will kill your site when they leave.  Having the right rules, practices and culture in place is harder to do but more resilient.  I don't care how idealistic, humble and/or brilliant any individual is, when some place starts catering overly much to that person's ego, it gets to the point where no one can disagree with them without all hell breaking loose.  This is not a good way to foster good conversation and at some point it will start driving away good people.<p>Even on Hacker News, the most highly voted comments tend to come over and over from the same people.  I have no reason whatsoever to believe that those individuals are simply always brilliant every time they open their mouth.  I have every reason to believe that the karma system encourages members to jump on the bandwagon and upvote certain people simply for being those people.  Having been the person on the pedestal, I think there is a serious downside to being on that pedestal and I actively seek to avoid being placed there.  The only thing I have found that works well and consistently as an antidote to being consistently attacked is to deflect public praise.  The one and only thing I know for sure is that the more some people heaped public praise upon me, the more other people felt the need to kick the    crap out of me, prove I did not know everything, and try desperately to bring me down a notch.  Conversely, not publicly thanking people for saying nice things about me, turning a deaf ear to it, and actively asserting that I don't have all the answers has dramatically reduced the degree to which I end up on the receiving end of ugly assaults.<p>(I cringe when I see other people having public praise heaped upon them.  The fall is highly likely to come sooner or later and most people don't really know how to deal effectively when their adoring fans suddenly turn into a rabid lynch mob, a la how Britney Spears seemed to just get crazier and crazier the more desperately she tried to get back her status as America's Darling.)",1286790916

1779241,comment,1778687,1778913,0,0,lsc,,,">My advice, is move to SF, find a job (hopefully one that will pay relocating costs), or maybe even a contracting one, and then develop your product on the side. When it is at least 60% done, and you have a bit more savings, go full swing into it.<p>overall, sound advice, I think.<p>Note:  if you move to silicon valley rather than SF, you can get a room in the lower-end but perfectly safe areas of Santa Clara or Sunnyvale for $600/month or so. $800-$1000 will get you a nice room that's near to the y combinator offices.    If you are renting a room, you often can get away with first and deposit, especially for lower end stuff.  Look around.<p>As for savings, well, that depends on your risk tolerance.   A year and a half seems pretty excessive to me, but then I personally co-sign business loans and leases, so if the company craters,  any personal money I had is gone anyhow.<p>If you are in a capital intensive space (e.g. you have to buy lots of servers like I do) contracting while you are starting up (if you can talk people into going corp to corp) can have some tax advantages, too.",1286789564

1779236,comment,1779001,1779001,0,0,pseudonym,,,"I think we've gotten better at compartmentalizing our conversations. When IRC and AOL chatrooms were big, the idea of online communication was fairly new. Nowadays, most people can handle the concept of asynchronous chatting with ease-- being able to follow multiple, non-real time (in the sense that you aren't forced to listen to the person at that moment in time-- a chat line can be read instantly, or when you're done with what you're doing) conversations at the same time.<p>To that end, most people don't even think about having group chats. They compartmentalize what they're doing into single units of required information, and then go to each person they need that unit from individually. Let's say you're having a party at Bob's place, Jill is bringing the food, and then you're meeting at the movie theatre at 6 beforehand. It's almost an ingrained reflex to converse with Bob in one chat window about cleaning up beforehand, while talking with Jill in window 2 about how many peppers to use, all while telling Alice and Eve to hold on while you hammer plans out in windows 3 and 4.<p>And the thing is, while this seems inefficient, from the side of who needs to know what, it's actually simplified. Bob doesn't need to know what kind of peppers are going to be in the food in order to take care of what he's doing. Neither does Jill need to know the details of which cleaning crew is going to be at Bob's before the party. And all Alice and Eve want to know is which movie theatre it is and how late the party's going til. For the most part, 1-to-1 communication does what we need it to without being overwhelming (as the chat window would end up being if we had Alice, Bob, Eve, and Jill with us in the same IRC channel).<p>Which isn't to say there aren't situations wherein having groups of people are useful. But those are generally defined as ""meetings"", and there's both explicit and unsaid rules that usually pertain to such things-- there's a point to the meeting, an agreement to not speak over each other, a meeting leader that has a syllabus to follow. You're not going to have 3 separate conversations going on where 2-3 people of the 10 at the table are talking across the table to each other during the meeting. And any meeting that doesn't have this sort of order imposed on it ends up being a waste of time, because no information gets passed on and nothing gets resolved. All you end up with is a mass of chaos wherein you have to tease bits of meaningful conversation out in a process roughly equivalent to trying to get a pair of headphones out of a ball of wire that's been sitting at the bottom of a desk drawer for a couple years.<p>tl;dr: I don't think it's a software issue so much as it is a wetware issue-- meaningful unstructured communication gets exponentially more difficult when more people are involved.",1286789178

1779210,comment,1777385,1778617,0,0,jiganti,,,"The way the poker economy works among the high stakes regulars is generally such that if you go 'busto', you'll inevitably be able to get staked from buddies if you are legitimately good. This results in players playing with extremely aggressive bankroll management.<p>In addition, there's no real visualization of the value of what you're playing for. It's just numbers on a computer screen. By far the most legendary story of a young player who's completely detached from the money is the Isildur1 phenomenon. [1]<p>I played high stakes online at a young age and felt the same sort of detachment- the appeal of ""getting to the top"" was too much to pass up to grind steadily at lower stakes. One of the problems is that over the past ten years, the dynamics of online games have changed considerably. Even an 18 month difference shows a dramatic development in the style of play you see- I'd contend that poker training sites like cardrunners play a large part in this. So a lot of players go on a tear for nine months, then have a big downswing as a result of moving up stakes too fast and failing to adjust their game.<p>One thing you see sometimes is tournament players like Zugwat trying to play high stakes cash games. It's well understood that in poker, the deeper the chip stacks are (defined by the number of big blinds players have) the more technically demanding the game will be. As tournament poker tends to be played with stacks of 10-50 big blinds, and cash games with 100-500 big blinds, the former requires less decision making. This is for a few reasons, but the main one is that on average you'll have fewer decisions to make with a smaller chip stack since you will be all in earlier in the hand.<p>Tournament players who are admittedly great at what they do often try to dabble in cash games because they've made enough to bankroll themselves for it. I remember watching Zugwat play Tom Dwan (who goes by the alias 'durrrr', [2] and talking to a few of the other high stakes regulars who had played him previously. The consensus was that he was pretty solid (which is saying something- many cash game players have a somewhat condescending attitude towards tournament players because of the supposed simplicity of tournament poker) but he had bit off much more than he could chew and would inevitably lose a good chunk of his bankroll before realizing it. I think he played four or five tables of 200/400 ($40,000 buyin per table) and lost about a quarter million that session. To his credit he was surprisingly mature in the chat box, something that can be hit or miss after large losses.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isildur1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isildur1</a>

When they added item drops, people started working hard to beat the system. Valve was not O.K. with this, but instead of banning everyone they simply deleted the ill-gotten items and gave people who hadn't 'cheated' the system a free hat in the form of a halo called ""Cheater's Lament"". They stepped on some toes because some people were falsely identified as cheating and lost items, but it went over pretty smooth.<p>It'd also be interesting to know more about the frequency of exploits against the two company's products. The Steam client is buggy, but when it comes to games it seems like Valve runs a pretty tight ship.",1286787649

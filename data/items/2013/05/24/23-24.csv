I bent it partially based on reading your Twitter feed and blog for years and seeing how you actually deal with people there.<p>Quick question, do you think the stuff you said about Marissa Mayer might be considered ""personal and negative"" by some people?  If so why is it OK for you to say personal and negative things about other people, but not vice versa.<p>I should apologize for generalizing. I am sure you are nice to a lot of people.  A lot of people seem to have a very high regard for you.  You may be very nice in real life, I have no way to gauge that.<p>The issue at hand here is are you nice, or at least civil, to people if they disagree with you, especially online?  Judging by comments on HN, you seem to have really viscerally angered a lot of people over the years. Why do you think that is?",1369439919

5765816,comment,5758521,5765304,2,0,betterunix,,,"The issue is not with the allocator; the issue is with the ability to read or write beyond the bounds of an array.  The fact that arrays are represented with pointers only worsens the problem.  Even for low-level code, it never makes sense to step out of array bounds.  Worse, though, is the fact that most C code is high-level, with no particular need or benefit from pointer acrobatics, and exposed to potentially malicious inputs.<p>A common refrain in these discussions is that C is good for some problem domains, and high level languages are good for others.  The problem is that C is not being used only for one domain or some set of domains; it is being used everywhere.  Web browsers and web servers are written in C.  Email clients are written in C.  Instant messaging programs.  It is hard to see how my email program benefits from pointer acrobatics, unchecked array access, or a pile of undefined behavior -- so why was it written in C?<p>You could say this is my main issue.  I can just assume that C is good in some domain, even if I never come across it; what I cannot understand is why high-level software is being written in a language that bogs programmers down with low-level concerns.  Even implementing a small core in C, and the rest in a high-level language (e.g. Emacs) makes more sense than what we see today.",1369439112

5765791,comment,5763100,5763100,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Keep in mind that most of what you're experiencing is common to a lot of other people. You're not at all alone. You're not in a situation where everyone else is succeeding and you're the only one that's struggling.<p>HN (and similar sites) primarily focus on the success stories, and it is very easy to let that warp your perception of your efforts, your abilities, your projects, yourself.<p>You may not have what it takes to launch or run a startup. Nothing wrong with that. You'll be in great company. If the stress of trying over and over again is getting to you, if you're feeling defeated, then stop. Step back, regroup. Think about what it is that you really want: do you want to be wealthy? There are other ways to do that. Do you want to make a difference? There are many ways to do that. Do you want to build cool stuff? Inspire others? Live a comfortable life with a family? Those are all OK, focus on them.<p>What you describe in your last lines sounds like depression to me, and it's a common problem too.<p>Point-by-point:<p>> <i>I tried during 5 years to create a ""startup"".</i><p>Why? What was your motivation here?<p>> <i>I still have a half time job that pay the bill and give me enough time to create something.</i><p>So, you're not yet fully committed to living or dying by your work. That's not necessarily bad, but realize this, because it's important: the less fully committed you are to your projects, the less likely they are to be successful.<p>> <i>During these 5 years I created a game, a tool for geeks, a B2B project and lot of more things.</i><p>This sounds unfocused to me. If we step outside of the startup drum circle for a moment, you'll find that a lot of businesses will spend around 5 years just trying to develop, market, and popularize a single project. The startup iteration cycle produces really amazing results when it works, but it also produces a lot of failures. If you've got the sort of personality that is discouraged by too many failures -- and again, you're not alone in that -- then maybe you should look at some of the more traditional business models. There are some very successful, under-appreciated people in our industry who have done just this.<p>> <i>Each time, I have no traction, negative feedback, I demotivating and then I stop the project.</i><p>A successful project is one that you do not give up on.<p>> <i>Each partners I meet seems too newbie to work with.</i><p>Is it possible that you're holding them to the wrong standards -- i.e., they're not ""YC material"" -- or that they've giving you good advice and you're not following it because it doesn't fit in with your expectations?<p>I don't know you well enough to give you more specific advice. (Nobody here does.) I deal with some of the same issues. Here's what I do to work around them:<p>- Change my mindset. I often remind myself that although things are not where I want them to be, they are still better every year. And, although I'm not running a multi-million-dollar-per-year business, I've still managed to make a real difference in the lives of other people.<p>- Make sure finances are comfortable and stay that way. I'm not rich, but I try to keep a little bit of slush in the bank, it keeps me from stressing too much about other stuff.<p>- Keep an active side project, something that I enjoy working on, that has no deadlines or associated stress.<p>- Take time to decompress, spend some time alone, recharge, whatever -- but find the desire again to keep chipping away.<p>- Realize that, even at 35, I'm still fairly young and the game's far from over.<p>- Just keep building.

It's amazing because you can have 50 towers on screen, all playing their firing animation, along with 100+ monsters walking with their animations.. and it handles well.<p>The reason we actually chose UIKit (over Cocos2D or OpenGL etc) was (1) my experience in it from app development, but (2) more importantly being able to use Apple's UI widgets. Like scrollviews, gesture-recognizers, etc... rather than try to write our own (I'm sure we've all played iOS games with weird UIs that are kind of like Apple's but fall short). Also, (3) was the speed of getting something working (kind of related to (1) for me).<p>Downsides are that there's no blending effects like 'additive' for lights/effects, and also it's not trivial to pause a game when it's running timers and core-animation separately (we do have a game loop for logic, but the monsters them-self just move on GPU-based core animations). I'd like to STRESS that using UIKit for most games is probably not a good idea.<p>Anyway, thought it might interest some people to hear this :)<p>Oh, and another benefit is no load screens.",1369437932

It's much better to write a prototype with a specific goal of wringing as much knowledge from it as you can without being distracted by scalability or maintainability minutiae.  Then, and only then, will you be ready to write The Real Thing with all of the bells and whistles.  In the end you'll probably save more time than if you kept going back and forth waterfall-style between learning and doing on the same codebase.  You'll certainly end up with a better result.<p>P.S.

There's obviously the whole Facebook uploading all your contacts without your permission issue (IIRC, that's still going on) and the fact that for whatever reason whenever I open up the Facebook app on an Android device, the GPS icon in my notification starts blinking that my location is being obtained. Which, if it were a rough network-based location to get my current city for targeted ads is fine - but it's not, and obtaining my exact location without my permission is <i>not</i> okay. (That's one of the things iOS gets right - per-app configurable permissions, it's a shame Android has nothing like it without a custom ROM.)<p>To clarify, I think Facebook (the app) itself is fantastic. The issue isn't the tech, it's the shady behavior by the company who develops it.",1369436733

No body or genes really needed - we just ""sit"" in RAM, interact with others via network and are - immortal. Ray Kurzweil says it may even happen in our lifetimes. Heard Stephen Hawking mentioning something similar. Reaching point that we can live forever and don't really need our body for that. Or our body can be strengthened by armor, hardware of various types, to be much better and advanced than our bodies are.<p>This reminds me a little bit the dilema local Government in Paris had in 1890s -- what we'll do with all the horse dung if the number of horses grows at the current rate?

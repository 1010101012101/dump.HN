There’s the never-ending loop where you create and evaluate and necessarily throw away.<p>A person with developed taste who ‘filters’ someone else’s creation, recognizes great work, helps the creator shape their output, is thus a part of the above loop, and depending on specifics may be of importance comparable to or greater than one of the creator.<p>The balance between contributions of different entities that cause a work to be created and known, or a style to be formed, is always fluid (among singers, performers, front-personas, authors, producers, mentors, labels, etc.). Replace one of the components with a computer and overall picture doesn’t change much.<p>If a piece of music was generated by software, then whoever set that software up and filtered its output is the creator. That may include the programmer, those who were using the software, other people who directly influenced the creation in significant way.<p>If a person using some generative algorithm doesn’t feel like their input was substantial enough, they might use a pseudonym. Attributing music to a computer explicitly would be purely marketing move and it doesn’t change the fact that author is always conscious being(s), which, unless we’re in singularity, a computer isn’t.",1439117583

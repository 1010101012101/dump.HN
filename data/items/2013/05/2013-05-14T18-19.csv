His lawyer's job is (literally, if you read his law society's rules) to create controversy while facilitating his client through the legal system, because the Lawyer ultimately works for the Courts first, the People second, and his Client third. Weev is not receiving accurate/valuable information while in jail (guards aren't going to tell you why they're moving you), and his lawyer is probably more focused on appeals than his treatment in jail. You will probably not see a mention of this segregation anywhere in the Defendant's future filings.<p>More than likely, someone got wind in General Population that he was a computer nerd, and an easy mark. he was probably moved to ""Administrative Segregation"" in order to protect him. Often, effeminate or homosexual males will be put in some sort of protective custody. This segregation is regularly done for retaliation, but all things considered, it's better than the alternative: Guards look the other way while people up for murder/abuse you in your cell.<p>The downfall of most Administrative Segregation is that the prisoner is now amongst the other segregated prisoners. usually, these prisoners are heavily-drugged, and wander aimlessly, unless they're being lined up for another dose of drugs. This tends to put the observing prisoners in a deep state of depression. I have personally witnessed (within a 2 week period of solitary) more than 10 people break down and ask the guards for drugs, because they were feeling suicidal in the protective environment.<p>Honestly, it's like sleeping and eating in your bathroom. I hope weev doesn't lose sight of that fact amongst all the ""correction"" he's experiencing.",1368557915

Could you elaborate on what types of businesses you have in mind?<p>I don't think education and income inequality are the real issue here. For the long-term homeless, it's not that they lack job skills. Nor is it that the poor make too little (which they do). Rather, most of these people are disabled, and <i>that</i> is the root cause of their homelessness.  In fact, a lot of them do have good educations and once held well-paying jobs.

It also adds muscle, which increases your BMR (AKA metabolism).<p>If your main interest is in gaining muscle and looking better, there may be better routines. But Starting Strength is about one thing ... strength. Pure and simple. It never claims otherwise.<p>Starting Strength has been used as a fundamental building block by athletic trainers for years; it is often modified to be sport specific, but its fundamental lifts have proven effective over and over. After one has reached strength standards, it is typical (and recommended) to move on to a more advanced strength routine, which may explain why many of the big guys you have met are no longer doing a stripped down strength routine.<p>Yes, those with serious pre-existing injuries may want to opt for a different program (probably machine based), but that will be true of almost any strength training program. Those with only minor injuries can just start SS at a lower weight and improve more slowly.<p>Hope that helps address your concerns.",1368557593

If the patent registrant fails to pay the government fees, the ""license"" can be ""revoked"".<p>If in doubt, ask your IP lawyer for confirmation of this fact.<p>It would perhaps be better for the discussion if all HN commenters knew how to define a US patent.  It is a right to sue.  Nothing more, nothing less.<p>Whatever else the registrant gets up to besides paying his patent maintenance fees (e.g. manufacturing, licensing, etc.), that's his business.   He may choose to do nothing.  Maybe he's just blocking someone else through the threat of litigation.<p>Do you all think the ""incentives"" for innovation come from having a right to sue?  As if prior to the 1600's and ""Letters Patent"" there existed no incentive for anyone to innovate.  Does a government incentivize innovation through giving the right to sue, for a recurring fee?  Do people stop innovating when they cannot sue each other?  Is it that simple?  Is there more to the story?  Maybe innovation exists without patents, but giving a right to sue is a way to ""protect"" the natural innovation instinct?  Maybe it's just a way to tax it?  What do you think?",1368557412

This is true whether we want it to be or not. As humanity has developed throughout history, physical strength has become less critical to our daily existence, but no less important to our lives. Our strength, more than any other thing\nwe possess, still determines the quality and the quantity of our time here in these bodies. Whereas previously our physical strength determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed, it now merely determines how well we function in these new surroundings we have crafted for ourselves as our culture has accumulated. But we are still animals - our physical existence is, in the final analysis, the only one that actually matters. A weak man is not as happy as that same man would be if he were strong. This reality is offensive to some people who would like the intellectual or spiritual to take precedence. It is instructive to see what happens to these very people as their\nsquat strength goes up.”",1368557369

5707014,comment,5705315,5705315,9,0,jarrett,,,"This article leaves out an important point: Most, if not all, programmers I know <i>do</i> care about these issues, but we can't solve them. We would if we could, but it's not what our profession is good at.<p>The title of the article, ""come here and work on hard problems – except the ones on our doorstep,"" speaks to this. We programmers have the tools to solve many interesting and important problems, but certainly not all. Deeply rooted social problems such as homelessness cannot be solved with a mobile app or data analysis.<p>So programmers see homeless people on the way to work, and we feel bad, but what can we do? Maybe the author wants us to feel guilty about the gap between rich and poor. But bear in mind most of us are <i>not</i> the rich of America. We're in the middle. Yes, it's much, much more comfortable in the middle than at the bottom, and I think most of us are grateful to be where we are. But most of us aren't aristocrats; we work for a living. And we're also not the ones who want to further widen the income gap. Rather, we tend to vote for progressive candidates and policies.<p>Is there more we could do? I'm not sure what it would be. Charitable donations help a little, but won't solve the problem. Volunteering helps a little, but again, it's marginal. It's the people who actually work in advocacy, politics, and homeless services that are really in a position to help solve these problems. Programmers just aren't the ones to do it.<p>Coincidentally, I actually <i>do</i> have some experience in the homeless services world. And from what I have seen, the solution is basically money.<p>Much of the homeless population cannot be permanently cured. There is no homelessness reboot, where you go in for rehab, mental health treatment, etc., and you come out ready to face the world as a gainfully employed, self-sufficient person. Even with treatment, relapses are the norm, rather than the exception.<p>Consequently, the realistic and humane solution is to put up the money for a basic safety net. Considering the number of homeless in our country and the rather modest price of providing basic food and shelter, it would not really be a noticeable drain on our society. And just to head off criticism: We're not talking about putting lazy people in the Hilton and feeding them caviar. Even spartan, barracks-style homeless shelters, such as the ones where I've worked, are a whole lot better than leaving people on the street. So-called lazy people (i.e. those who <i>can</i> work but don't want to) will not take advantage of this, because it's not an attractive option. No matter how lazy you are, you will choose to work over living in a homeless shelter if you can.",1368556727

AFTER EDIT: I have been in, and have lived in, gritty ""skid row"" neighborhoods of large United States cities, and have lived in Los Angeles.) Places with lousy weather, like the place where I grew up and now live, certainly have people who are ""homeless"" in the sense of not having a secure legal right to occupy a particular place at their own discretion, but most people with that lack of legal right to choose their living circumstances are indoors during cold winter nights. There is much provision of emergency shelter in the United States, by both governmental organizations and private charities. There are also both federal and state programs for providing free or heavily subsidized leaseholds for housing to poor families, and private charities that build single-family homes for poor families. People are more visibly out on the street in the United States mostly on a regional or seasonal basis.<p>Since quite a few of the comments here mention Europe, my question (as someone who has never been to any part of Europe) is where do people live in Europe if they have no personal funds to buy or rent housing?

There are many points of detail where those wishing to preserve the competitive system and those wishing to super-cede it by something different will disagree on the details of such schemes; and it is possible under the name of social insurance to introduce measures which tend to make competition more or less ineffective.

The truck had a huge sign on the back that said 'do not follow into work zone', but how can i possibly know if i'm following a truck into a work zone without some indication of where the work zone is? There were no other signs or lights or orange barrels or anything.<p>Another example is the way exit ramp signage is written where i live. Highway signs don't include units of measure when they refer to distance, so the first few times i saw the sign 'ABC ROAD — 2' i had no idea that it was telling me that the exit for Abc Road was in 2 MILES, not that i was meant to take Exit 2, which happened to be the very next exit after the sign.<p>The 11foot8 Web site linked elsewhere in the thread mentions that the rail bridge has a flashing sign that says 'OVERHEIGHT WHEN FLASHING'. The site calls this 'pretty good' signage. It makes sense sitting at my computer reading about it, but i can almost guarantee that if i was seeing that sign for the first time on the road i would have absolutely no fucking idea what it was talking about until after i had already crashed into the bridge.<p>etc.",1368555120

5706734,comment,5703713,5704623,1,0,JDGM,,,"Sure! Actually the line on the ball had nothing to do with the Ikaruga element, it was purely to observe spin. I think we probably originally put it in so that when playtesting we could tell if spin was working properly but it stayed in because it looked neat and was helpful.<p>So here's how the Ikaruga element worked: each player had three controls 'up', 'down', and 'change bat colour'. The bats could be either black or white, and so could the ball. If you tried to return a shot but your bat wasn't the same colour as the ball then you'd lose the point. The beauty of it was that if you were holding down the 'change colour' button when you returned the ball then the colour of the ball would change. So let's say you have two players who are getting into a heated rally both with white bats and a white ball. They're concentrating on trying to catch the other one with good shots rather than the colour when, suddenly, one player presses change colour to change their bat to black, then again to change it back to white, but they keep it held down. They return the next shot and now the ball is black. Their opponent has to change their bat colour quickly in response otherwise they'll lose the point. Pretty soon the mindgames set in - changing your bat colour twice but <i>not</i> holding down the button to trick your opponent into thinking the ball is going to change colour, or my personal favourite <i>always</i> changing the ball colour and then suddenly not doing so out of the blue. We could have made a fourth button for the change ball colour instead of doubling up the functionality of the change bat colour button, but the way it telegraphed possible intention was kinda cool. That was the Ikaruga dimension of the game.<p>There was another nifty element I remember too which was that the ball was returned faster the closer to the centre of the bat it was struck, or slower nearer the edges, with a few pixels of sweet spot in the exact centre which would give a mega shot.<p>It was one of those games you make quickly and then spend hours ahem ""testing"" multiplayer in between adding new features. It was really fun because of five main things to be thinking about while playing: simply returning the ball (!), having the right colour bat (the most basic Ikaruga element), putting tricky spin on the ball (made all the more fun by the rotation of red diameter line showing exactly how much spin you'd put on it), hitting near the centre to make a fast hard-to-return shot (with a satisfying ""whoomph"" sound and particle trail effect for the mega shots), and finally the cheeky ball colour switch mindgames.<p>I'll have to dig it up, check it all still works, and put it somewhere for people to download. Or at the very least make a youtube video to show how it works (on reflection, that would have probably been less effort than the above write up!). Cheers :)",1368554499

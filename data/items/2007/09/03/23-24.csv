Parents will never have their kids back when the kids go off to college. They'll trade the kids in for adults. The empty nest feels empty in part because parents know it will never again be filled with children.<p>But business isn't like that. People that fail can and should continue to go off and try to do other great things. It's cyclic.<p>Even if all the companies in the current batch die, all the founders can continue to go and do good things. <p>They might be a bit less wide-eyed and optimistic, but that is probably a good thing. You only really die off when you stop working.<p>The mathematician Paul Erdos took this a bit too literally, and would lament the death of colleagues who retired. He also called children epsilons. \n",1188863818

49811,story,,,1,0,amichail,"Instant feedback is bad in games if you would like users to play daily?",,"I've built a Facebook game that makes use of rounds where you can only make a single move in a round.  You then need to wait until the round ends  to see the result (which can take up to 24 hours).<p>So far, it seems that a significant fraction of users keeps coming back to see the result -- and while they are visiting, make another move.<p>This seems like a better way to go than instant feedback if you would like a significant fraction of users to play the game every day.  Of course, there should be a good reason for the wait -- and in my game, there is.<p>BTW, I actually have several games in progress so you may be able to make multiple moves in a single visit.  This allows players to have more to do per visit.",1188861909

I know they are all standards based and that will be there undoing.  Microsoft is making people download some ""extras"" which I am certain will make whatever they create look like a desktop application, feel like a desktop application, but will be on the web.<p><p>",1188861769

49808,comment,49691,49691,0,0,Hamhock,,,"I don't understand this common notion that if you don't like the way someone runs their business, you get to change their business model for them. Here's a quote from a pro-blocking blog post that nickb linked to in another comment:<p>""Frankly, as far as I'm concerned, if a webmaster runs a site that's popular enough that the costs become at all significant, the onus is on him (or her) to find ways to cash in on that popularity to keep the site going. The visitors have no duty at all, and they certainly aren't obliged to go out of their way to make money for somebody else.""<p>My response is that they did come up with a way to monetize their content (ads), but you don't like it. Too bad. Don't go to the site if you don't like the way they've chosen to make money. This goes along the same lines that if music is too expensive, or has DRM, that you therefore get to download it for free via filesharing, bittorrent, etc.... You don't. You're only ethical option is to not buy the content. That's the only ethical way you send a message (in this trivial context, obviously if were talking about human rights, etc..., the ethics of protest methodologies become more complicated). If I think something in a brick and mortar store is too expensive, would anyone think it was ok for me to just steal it? I don't think so. <p>A lot of the complaints about bad advertising practices, obtrusive adds, DRM, overpriced content are in fact valid complaints. But, you don't get to overrule the content provider's methods just because you feel like it.<p>",1188861189

49806,comment,49784,49784,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Mergers & acquisitions are really complicated, and often are unsuccessful by a variety of metrics even when they look good on paper.  This is especially true of M&A between two very small companies.  And I would imagine YC doesn't own much of either company, so beyond a mere suggestion, it would be up to those companies to individually choose that path among the universe of their possible options.<p>That being said, the idea of a merger here doesn't even make much sense to me.  Wufoo seems more targeted at business and Weebly at personal.  But I don't know too much about either having never used either for real, so I'll stop here.",1188861000

49803,comment,49787,49798,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"I didn't mean to suggest you thought you might get an increase in sales.  I was just trying to frame the point.  So sorry about that.<p>In the past I have used CyberSource and VeriSign, and have recommended CyberSource in the news.yc discussions.  (The PayFlow division of Verisign has been acquired by PayPal.)  CyberSource has a small business option that has worked well for my businesses.  They have an easy to use API, etc.<p>However, for this project I am trying out PayPal Pro.  Not that I love PayPal or anything, but I thought I would give it a shot. (Last time I evaluated PayPal, they didn't have a merchant option.)  Two things I like about them so far: 1) they don't seem to require an explicit personal guarantee, although I am not live yet and it might be implicit in the terms; and 2) they seem to have American Express integration from the get-go, as opposed to all the others where you have to sign up with them directly.  I could be wrong on both of those, though.<p>Another thing.  In your case, the difference from off-site/on-site checkout might be substantial because I imagine trust matters a lot in the medical arena.  It is one thing if you are buying a T-shirt and the merchant has you leave the site to pay, but on a professional site for a serious product, you expect the site to just have that checkout process as part of their site.  That is not to say you can't additionally offer Google Checkout and/or PayPal for those customers who prefer it.\n",1188860410

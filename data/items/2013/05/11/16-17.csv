The actual explanation for this is a lot more reasonable:<p>""Him: OK, I figured out what happened.\nIt wasn't ideal in terms of commits.\nSo, we have an old configuration system GConf, and we replaced it with our new one, GSettings, for N reasons.\nGSettings was missing a feature for gnome-terminal to implement, so it went without GSettings for a long time, until the 3.8 cycle, when we ported it over with a workaround.\nThe port wasn't 100% complete, so it landed with the intention of adding feature parity, like with terminal transparency support.<p>However, after asking our team, we decided it wasn't worth it keeping the support code around for terminal transparency, and dropped it.<p>It's an unfortunate thing that happened where the reasoning wasn't relayed entirely in commit messages, and you're right -- it was dropped in a seemingly unrelated commit.\nBut that's after intentions changed -- a broken port to new tech with the intention to fix it, then that changed, and thus it got dropped under the guise of ""Remove dead code""<p>me:  fair enough.\nso the only wrongdoing really was persch's response.<p>Him:  Yeah.

""Linux needs a desktop for all of these people who don't use linux"". We need to build something for the non-users.... and the other developers looked at each other and agreed. ""YES! Let's throw away our current user base and focus on the users we don't have"".

I'd argue that they are not: it's just that the SW ecosystem commonly used in practice is all too bloated which may create this impression. (HW as well, compare x86 with something nice, for example MIPS :-)) Many people would probably be surprised how small and simple can many useful things actually be.<p>(Also, I have a growing suspicion that the complexity of the current HW/SW ecosystem is partly driven by their independent development, and partly by having to implement legacy stuff - case in point, you need a complex GPR allocator to generate efficient x86 code, and you need complex register-renaming HW in the CPU to actually process x86 code quickly. Simply raising the GPR count and redesigning the ISA would alleviate both sources of complexity. I'm growing increasingly fond of all those 1970's/1980's <i>actual</i> ""full-stack"" projects.)<p>Oh, and what computers use germanium doping?

When we have to upgrade, what we want is for that to just continue to work, but with bugs fixed.<p>In practice we wind up having to reconfigure to get back to the same state as before.  And this makes us want to avoid upgrading.  This also makes people who care not be involved in development - after all our environments are as we want them to be, and we want that to get out of our way so that we continue to work.  So developers never hear from us unless something breaks.  And then we're upset.<p>When an upgrade means getting rid of the way that we are used to working, we get unhappy.  Therefore people who develop desktops do not like people like me.  I can understand that.  But I still do not appreciate the arrogance and condescension that I see coming from desktop developers towards people like me.<p>I personally have no idea why people get involved with developing desktops.

102689,comment,102683,102683,0,0,cperciva,,,"The ideal solution is to take 20 bits (low bits, high bits, middle bits -- it doesn't matter) from HMAC-SHA256(key, URL).  An HMAC is considered ""broken"" if an attacker who doesn't know the key can do significantly better than random chance at guessing what the HMAC of a different URL would be; so until someone breaks HMAC-SHA256 and as long as your secret key remains secret, no attacker will be able to create a denial of service via hash collisions.<p>Weaker options may or may not be secure; speaking as someone who is professionally paranoid, I suggest not trying to invent your own mechanisms.  If you don't have an implementation of HMAC-SHA256 readily available, HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-MD5 are <i>probably</i> adequate, depending on how paranoid you are.  (Or if C code works for you, let me know and I'll point you towards my BSD licensed HMAC-SHA256 code.)",1201075156

You could argue that the only reason to build your own data center is if you believe you can do it better than Amazon, if of course you can match your architecture to their system.",1201075081
102687,comment,102683,102685,0,0,brianr,,,"XOR with the secret key sounds like a good idea... hashing the whole file won't work though, since I want to check the hash before generating the file--I'm hashing the URL to prevent an attacker from asking the server to generate billions of images. Think it will still work well if the input is only 20-30 characters?",1201074398

Maybe use the facial screening to determine if a good enough picture was taken of you before sending it to RIAA.",1201074291

102683,story,,,10,21,brianr,"Ask YC: Suggestions for a hash algorithm?",,"For a project I'm working on right now (an image server that dynamically generates images based on a URL and caches them on disk), I'm planning to use 20 bits worth of hash as both the directory path and a simple checksum. The string being hashed will be the filename concatenated with a secret key, which will hopefully prevent DOS attacks.<p>I don't really know anything about hashing... my ideas so far are to use the last 20 bits of MD5, or maybe the first 20 bits of Adler32. Even distribution is more important than speed. Can anyone offer any advice here?",1201073514

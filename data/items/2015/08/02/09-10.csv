9990263,comment,9988266,9988266,0,0,wuch,,,"<p><pre><code>  In fact, prior to Java 8, you could not even declare unsigned integers.\n</code></pre>\nIn Java 8 you still can&#x27;t declare unsigned integers. It just that API have been\nextended to provide operations that treat an int or a long as having unsigned\nvalue.<p><pre><code>  This seems to imply that Java leaves the behaviour of signed integer overflow\n  up to the underlying hardware, but guarantees a two&#x27;s complement\n  representation even if the architecture does not.  It seems reasonable to\n  expect that it would simply wrap to 0 (I wasn&#x27;t able to find a more\n  conclusive reference for this).\n</code></pre>\nIn fact Java Specification does specify what happens in case of overflow very\nprecisely. For example for multiplication (section 15.17.1):<p><pre><code>  If an integer multiplication overflows, then the result is the low-order bits\n  of the mathematical product as represented in some sufficiently large\n  two&#x27;s-complement format.\n</code></pre>\nAnd for addition (section 15.18.2):<p><pre><code>  If an integer addition overflows, then the result is the low-order bits of the\n  mathematical sum as represented in some sufficiently large two&#x27;s-complement\n  format.\n\n</code></pre>\nJava approach without undefined behaviour would seem to be quite convenient for\na programmer, but it does not seem to be the case in practice. Of course you\ngain ability to check for overflow after performing the operation, which is\nnice, but at the same time loose the straightforward way to detect bugs\nprovided by undefined behaviour (UB).<p>If an application executes UB, then it is obviously wrong, thus a simple\ninstrumentation of arithmetic operation followed by a check for overflow gives\na way to detect such problems without false positives (see for example\n-fsanitize=undefined and similar options available in modern C/C++ compilers).<p>IMHO only very small fraction of overflow bugs would have been fixed by just\nwrapping result around.",1438509225

But, Wal-Mart sells a low quality Velcro tennis shoe for $10. The problem is it only lasts about 6-8 weeks before the it falls apart.  But by converting the $10 shoe into a subscription service at $5 a month, a company can turn a shoe into financial instrument, and <i>poof</i>, magically it matches my lower price point and I can justify a $5 subscription instead of a $70 sale.

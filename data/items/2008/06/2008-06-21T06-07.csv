PG has already told us he's taking the feature out ... should be gone in a few days.<p>Incidentally, we never wanted iPaper to be implemented how it was on Hacker News.  Our recommended implementation is always to give users a choice between iPaper and the original format.  We asked PG to change it several times, but he was too busy creating the next 12 Googles, not that I blame him.<p>JDF

223535,story,,,5,12,alnayyir,"How many of you would use a digital library?",,"I mean a true digital library that has non-public works that haven't been expired yet. I've been working out a legal contraption in my mind combined with some locative ideas, and I might have some ideas for working it out. Anyway, this would be an ad supported venture.<p>I'm not certain how I'd make the media accessible, I definitely don't want a scribd situation, and I want to leave the option of downloading for use on PDAs and other devices.<p>I guess my question is...should I bother? I came up the idea out of pure frustration in trying to find a Gore Vidal novel I wanted on the internet. Now I'm getting a damn library card tomorrow (today technically).<p>If you would make use of this, how frequently would you do so?",1214030800

223529,comment,223499,223499,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I happen to prefer it.  On every computer I use (all of which run some variant of Linux), Acrobat Reader opens in a pop up window, which is annoying and slow.  I generally simply avoid all PDF links for this reason, but Scribd links aren't quite as offensive.  I'd certainly always prefer my web to be HTML only (with a few pictures of cats), but if you've got to send me to a PDF, it might as well be one that lives in the browser.<p>I'm not sure why there's been such a backlash against Scribd lately.  It's just something you read, you know?  Neither PDF nor Scribd is enjoyable to use...so why complain about Scribd?  It makes it more convenient and fast for some of us, and doesn't really impact others very much.  Just because you happen to find Acrobat Reader slightly less annoying than Scribd (because I know you can't find reading PDFs enjoyable) doesn't mean you should be able to make the experience here at HN less consistent.  I know that PDF links at HN will always be reasonably fast and available on my machines without having a new window open.  If you could choose to provide a PDF directly, I would no longer click on PDFs, because I would never know whether I was getting the slow and irritating popup window, or the much less slow and mostly non-irritating Scribd interface.",1214029985

There's no obvious modification of the URL query string to make it show in the view where there is a download link.  So if you see a big mangled attempt at loading flash instead of flash for whatever reasons, there's no other option.<p>This page has an acceptable view where there is a link to download:

I'll definitely be tuning in regularly. Hell, I'd pay if they keep the quality good.<p>",1174484583

Police arrived with guns drawn.<p>( These teletype services are frequently used for credit card fraud as a way for the perpetrator to remain anonymous. )\n",1174484350

I'm in Canada, and it felt like I was at that party.<p>I kept having the strange urge to talk directly to people like pg, Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, as if Justin were some kind of Telepresence bot, or medium. It's weird to think of him walking around, with all these ""spirits"" in his head.<p>The robot demo was fascinating, and I love the unscriptedness. I think I prefer that to an edited or scripted documentary. You can infer a lot from the raw data that wouldn't make it through the editorial process.",1174482701

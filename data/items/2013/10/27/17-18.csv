The song Heroin has so much dissonance and noise throughout that it&#x27;s almost revolting to listen to.  Over time it grew into one of my favorite songs in that I learned to find beauty in the clash of consonance and dissonance.  At the risk of hyperbole, that mindset of finding something new from the conflict of opposing forces is something that now applies in far more areas of my life than just music, and the VU was the vehicle that introduced me to that philosophy.",1382896724

What&#x27;s important is the other &quot;minor tobacco alkaloids&quot; like anatabine, anabasine, myosimine, etc.<p>Beta-carboline MAOI&#x27;s, like the minor alkaloids, do have a potentiating effect with nicotine and therefore increase satisfaction or the potential for addiction; however, these MAOI&#x27;s are pyrosynthesized (created by burning) 20-40x.

As for the more constant usage, it&#x27;s definitely a problem, and one that will need some creativity to solve. I don&#x27;t buy the explanation that you&#x27;re getting less nicotine from it. People who use high-concentration liquid seem to have just as much as a problem with it as people who don&#x27;t. As for the MAOI explanation: I&#x27;ve known people who use MAOIs and ecigs at the same time. They exhibit the same behavior.<p>What I think is happening is this: With a classical cigarette, there&#x27;s a clear beginning and end. With an e-cig there isn&#x27;t. You&#x27;re getting a dopamine reward every time you hit it, and there&#x27;s no cue to stop. My recommendation to anyone starting on ecigs would therefore be to start with a very low nicotine concentration, and stay there.<p>If you want to avoid this effect, that is. If you don&#x27;t care (and there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a health reason to care), then I just wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.",1382896449

Putting the fanboy in me aside, I think Tesla was correct in shooting for such large battery packs in their vehicle. It greatly diminishes the range anxiety EV owners might feel. The other factor you can&#x27;t control for is that, in my opinion, if you own a Tesla its going to be much easier for you to charge at your workplace or your home. You&#x27;re probably a high net worth individual who is going to have a much easier time having chargers installed at home or work. Most Leaf owners I&#x27;d imagine (NO DATA HERE, JUST MY ASSUMPTION) are city dwellers in condos or apartments where its going to be much more difficult to get charging infrastructure installed above a 15-20A/120V circuit.",1382896403

Therefore, you can construct a profitless business scheme that reinvests all profits (or doesn&#x27;t generate any) as long as your sales forever climb.  It&#x27;s the business equivalent of the Ponzi scheme--and if you look at Amazon&#x27;s revenue, it is a classic exponential curve.<p>If sales ever plateau and investors force you to generate profits, the plane stalls and the whole thing spirals down, because it&#x27;s the profit reinvestment which actually drives sales growth, and actual profits attract competitors who have been unable to pull off the profitless-hyper-growth trick.  So far that hasn&#x27;t happened.<p>Amazon&#x27;s value is in the entire business and not the sum of its parts, which means that at some point, investors expect to own a profit making enterprise and not a bunch of warehouses.  However, that won&#x27;t happen until sales plateau or Bezos dies.  Ironically, at that point the business loses a lot of value, both because growth has stopped and because competitors are about to enter the space, emboldened by Amazon&#x27;s newly discovered profits.  The whole thing is a bit of a sham.  Any growth industry (Internet retail) can support only one &quot;no profit rocket,&quot; and eventually it comes back to earth when that industry matures and ends the hypergrowth phase.",1382895432

 - The string object has to be fixed-size because objects are always (at least officially) fixed-size.
 - The string storage has to live on the heap, because it can be arbitrarily large.<p>So printing out a linked-list of strings gets two pointer dereferences per string instead of one. I guess that&#x27;s the cost of abstraction, though.<p>(This actually fits into the C++ zero-cost-abstraction narrative pretty well, though:<p>- Linked-lists are not zero cost,
 - C++ programmers don&#x27;t like non-zero-cost abstractions,
 - C++ programmers don&#x27;t like linked lists.<p>:)",1419501447

8795926,comment,8788685,8795328,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"I am skeptical of your claim that sharing scientific research or interpreting science is more harmful than good. Please provide justification. I do not think that being ignorant leaves anyone better off. Scientists in general do not make social policy. Every person who votes and participates in our democracy makes social policy, to some extent - even if only city council, school board, etc. Some understanding of an issue is better than none, even if their understanding is worse than a scientist&#x27;s. The right correction in these situations is more knowledge, not less. Today&#x27;s college students have as much or more knowledge and understanding of their fields as expert scientists did only a few centuries ago. We have to start somewhere.<p>Research into sex differences has yielded real benefits. Research into differences in life expectancy, bone density, heart disease, etc., have helped a lot of people. Some issues are largely gender-specific, like breast cancer, and better understanding the nature of sex differences can yield crucial insight into treatments.<p>Research is also gradually gaining a scientific understanding of the cognitive differences between men and women at higher levels of behavior. See &quot;Foetal testosterone and the child systemizing quotient&quot; (European Journal of Endocrinology, 2006). Paraphrased:<p>> A growing body of evidence suggests that, on average, males spontaneously &quot;systemize&quot; to a greater degree than do females. &quot;Systemizing&quot; is a cognitive process defined by the drive to analyze or construct systems. Our study explored foetal testosterone (fT) levels as a candidate biological factor influencing sex differences in systemizing. Males (mean 27.79) tested significantly higher than females (mean 22.59) on systemizing quotient, confirming that boys systemize to a greater extent than girls. This study suggests that the levels of fT are a biological factor influencing cognitive sex differences and lends support to the empathizing–systemizing theory of sex differences.<p><a href=""http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2006_Auyeung_fT&SQ.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2006_Auyeung_fT&...</a><p>This same research also offers insight into medical conditions. The authors discuss the application to understanding autism:<p>> Individuals with [autism] score
higher than normal males on the [systemizing quotient], who in turn score higher than normal females. Baron-Cohen has
described autism as an extreme manifestation of some
sexually dimorphic traits. The extreme male brain (EMB)
theory of autism is an extension of the [empathizing-systemizing] model of sex differences and proposes that individuals with ASC are impaired in empathizing and are at least average or superior in systemizing relative to their mental age.<p>In other words, better understanding of fetal testosterone may give us insight into the causes of autism, which hopefully will some day lead to early detection and prevention. Autism is four times more common in men than women, by the way. I could also see this research having applications to education, specifically in the type of learning material and activities that might be most effective for male and female students.<p>The science I&#x27;m presenting is not fringe. You&#x27;ll find a good deal of it in a typical college psychology textbook. &quot;Leave science for the scientists&quot; is a point of view with poor respect for human intelligence. Like the majority of autistics, the majority of scientists are also men. I think women, and people in general, ought to think about these issues critically. Psychology, especially social psychology and evolutionary psychology and similar fields, lend themselves well to at least a degree of &quot;pop&quot; analysis and understanding. The subject of these fields is the human condition, with which we all have experience. A person off the street will not have the necessary experience with control theory to understand a paper about robotics. By comparison, one does not need a doctorate in psychology to grasp the implications of, for example, the famous Stanford Prison Experiment.",1419501017

8795903,comment,8792778,8795786,0,0,Jongseong,,,"Are you talking about loanwords from English in the Korean used in North Korea? Korean was already borrowing words from English decades before the division of the peninsula, as you can see in writings from the Japanese colonial period. So North Korea inherited a lot of these same loanwords. It has nothing to do with South Korean influence, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re suggesting, as the language communities of the North and South have been effectively cut off from each other since the war.<p>However, there are often differences in the spelling of such loanwords between the North and the South. So you have 프로그람 (p&#x27;ŭrogŭram) in the North but 프로그램 (p&#x27;ŭrogŭraem) in the South for &quot;programme&quot;, 텔레비죤 (t&#x27;ellebijyon) in the North but 텔레비전 (t&#x27;ellebijŏn) in the South for &quot;television&quot;, and 미싸일 (missail) in the North but 미사일 (misail) in the South for &quot;missile&quot;. This is due to the fact that the standardized spelling of loanwords (a problematic and much debated area of Korean orthography) was frequently reformed in South Korea, and probably in the North as well, so the principles of spelling have turned out quite differently between the two. Also, as North Korea uses a lot of loanwords from Russian, even loanwords originally from English tend to be absorbed in the Russian pronunciation, such as 땅크 (ttangk&#x27;ŭ) for &quot;tank&quot; or 뜨락또르 (ttŭrakttorŭ) for &quot;tractor&quot; as opposed to SK 탱크 (t&#x27;aengk&#x27;ŭ) or 트랙터 (t&#x27;ŭraekt&#x27;ŏ) which is closer to the English pronunciation.<p>The official language policy in both the North and the South tends to discourage loanwords from English, but it seems a bit more successful in the North, especially when it comes to post-1945 loanwords. If you only focus on the differences between the North and the South, then you see many cases where North Korea uses native Korean words whereas South Korea uses loanwords from English. But you can&#x27;t extrapolate from that and conclude that North Korea doesn&#x27;t use loanwords from English at all. This would be a misconception, just like the false notion that North Korea doesn&#x27;t use Sino-Korean words.",1419499818

8795878,comment,8795731,8795731,0,0,nyc640,,,"I used Julia for both a machine learning course and a neural networks course this past semester, and I really enjoyed the experience of developing in the language. I found it really a lot faster than python/numpy and a lot more sane than Matlab. Some key syntactical structures are also very purposefully kept similar to Matlab so it was very easy to translate code between the two, which is incredibly useful in scientific computing. I definitely recommend people check it out; however, I will warn any potential users that the run times of Julia programs right now (as of 0.3.x) are incredibly slow if you need to include any third party libraries. I understand they&#x27;re working on this for a future release (maybe 0.4), but even including a simple plotting package in your code currently causes a 20-40 second overhead before your code actually starts running because the packages aren&#x27;t precompiled.<p>Oh, and one more tip for OSX users wanting to try out Julia. You might want to just use the app bundle provided on the Julia homepage rather than compiling from the homebrew tap. I spent close to an hour waiting for all the dependencies to compile before giving up when I realized I don&#x27;t want to be doing this every time it&#x27;s updated.",1419498622

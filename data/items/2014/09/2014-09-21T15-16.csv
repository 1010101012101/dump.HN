It&#x27;s hard to size up a place until you&#x27;re there a few weeks/months.<p>For example, at my current job, the boss admitted on the interview that their system was a mess and they wanted to clean it up.  But, once I was working there, I&#x27;m doing 100% maintenance with no real opportunity to refactor or clean up the old system.<p>Also, after a management change, a good job can turn bad.  When my current boss was hired, all the programmers hired by the previous boss quit in the next few months.<p>I had a job turn sour when a coworker was fired.  I had double the workload, and the easier tasks my ex-coworker was doing wound up on me.<p>It does get a lot harder as you get older.  If a job ad says 2-5 years of experience, then 15 years of experience makes you ineligible.  Also due to technology churn, your experience in older languages has a market value of zero (even though it does have real value).<p>I have had jobs that I liked.  In one job, most of the team interviewing me seemed awful.  The guy I wound up working with was very nice, but he only spoke for me for 2 minutes during the interview.  I thought I flunked the interview and it would be an awful job, but it wound up being nice.",1411315156

As for crossing London... let&#x27;s say you work in Old Street - that&#x27;s a good half an hour from Paddington.  I think you&#x27;d be lucky to have a door-to-door trip take less than three hours.<p>I commute into Oxford Circus from Castle Cary (in Somerset, roughly the same journey time as from Bristol Temple Meads) one day a week: I set off from my house at 6.50am, driving to the station allowing myself ample time to collect my ticket and so as not to miss my train in case of getting stuck behind tractors, and I get into the office at 9.50am.  On a good day.  I don&#x27;t mind the six hours of travel one day a week (and I am occasionally quite productive on the train, though often on the journey home I tend to get mildly drunk reading The Economist) - but doing all five days would drive me insane.",1411315063

The API allows for idiomatic, fairly concise, and consistently patterned code. It also adheres to a lot of the coding conventions that android devs are used to like callback functions for asynchronous operations. Set up is super easy too. The offline caching feature is really easy and useful.<p>That being said, if you have the skill set and time as a developer to be able to implement all of those features and a server/db component, I would. It may not be as robust or clean as the Parse API but hey if its your code it shouldn&#x27;t be terrible to work with.

It&#x27;s difficult to tell the difference between a sustainable business model with clear vision and values, vs the typical &quot;hypergrowth&quot; startup which a year from now will probably have either shut down, completely pivoted, or been acquired.<p>An idea I had which could help alleviate this problem: a set of standardised &quot;pledges&quot; which startups can commit to, which outline some mututally agreeable obligations between the service and the end user.<p>This could of course cover many areas, but the ones that I think would make a good start are: Long-term service (X years minimum of guaranteed service), Personal data integrity (no selling data to 3rd parties), No data lock-in, Transparent subscription pricing, and Privacy-first (user data always private unless opting-in).<p>Draft for the more detailed conditions of the pledges here:<p>- https://github.com/jamesisaac/pledges/blob/master/pledges.md<p>Advantage for users: easy to recognise at a glance that the company is following agreeable standards (don&#x27;t have to scrutinise marketing copy / terms of use / privacy policy).  Advantage for providers: clear focus on values could be a USP over competitors.<p>I&#x27;ve created an example of how this could be presented on my product&#x27;s landing page: https://nachapp.com (scroll to &quot;Our values&quot;)<p>So, is anyone here interested in this?  I think it would work best as a group/community effort where the pledges are finalised by consensus.  So, if you&#x27;re either a user who&#x27;d like to help define what constitutes a good product, or a founder who&#x27;d potentially be interested in committing to these pledges, it would be great if you could drop me an email (contact details in profile) so I can coordinate the effort and keep everyone updated.",1411314596

Almost nobody outside of indie-land has even looked at it because there&#x27;s no reason to when libgnm is right there and you still pay a significant performance vig, in an industry where you do not get the luxury of ignoring performance, for an only marginally better API. The Xbox One, on the other hand, does provide what appears (I don&#x27;t have access to any of these consoles, I just know a lot of game devs who like to drink) to be a complete DX11 implementation...and it&#x27;s plagued with perf issues you don&#x27;t see on a PC because the assumptions of the API don&#x27;t map to the actual hardware--which, I understand, the lower-level constructs of DX12 will address.<p>The future of non-indie game development seems very much to be going towards hardware: Mantle, Metal, libgnm, DX12. If you&#x27;re on a console, you can afford to actually develop for the console. If you&#x27;re not, you don&#x27;t matter. (Indies don&#x27;t care, but few people care about them, so that tail wouldn&#x27;t wag the dog. Nobody cares about Steam Machines, so I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d bring them up.)",1411313387

In Lisp, it&#x27;s very easy, so Lisp is meaningfully homoiconic.<p>For a C program to modify its code, it needs access to its source code (which it might not have) and a compiler (also not necessary) and the programmer has to write rather contrived code to modify the source, compile it, fork, and start executing the result. So C is not meaningfully homoiconic.<p>Or I suppose the C program could modify an executable directly, but that is even more contrived since it requires the programmer to work with a completely different representation (machine code) than the language of the original program.",1411313357

Though I do now see the &quot;unsafe&quot; page, which at least has assembly hooks.<p>Serious question though: has anyone ever done this?  I mean, are there kernel header import utilities I can use to get the flag definitions and parameter structs, etc...?  You can sneer and downvote me all you want, but it seems that the clear truth is that Rust has <i>not</i> been used as a &quot;systems programming language&quot; in the only regime where IMHO that term has any meaning.<p>Basically: drilling a hole through the compiler to the assembler (which I&#x27;ll state again is done in Rust as yet more complicated syntax users need to learn and not as, say, a native library interface) is a valuable tool, but it does not a syscall interface make.",1411311808

It appears to be written to teach people who already know the material.<p>In the previous article, the closest thing to an explanation or definition of a loop invariant is, &quot;We can make it less so by writing down a specific claim that applies to our particular loop. Such a claim is called a loop invariant.&quot; Not a very good description, and he doesn&#x27;t try to do any better elsewhere.<p>I ended up having to do a bunch of googling after reading the articles to piece together what is trying to be explained, since I had never heard of loop invariants in that terminology either.<p>Simply put, a loop invariant is a condition or set of conditions that is true through the loop. This makes it akin to inductive proofs. The loop invariant must prove true for n and n+1 for it to be true for the entirety of the loop. Noting how similar this is to inductive reasoning, you can apply an inductive proof to a loop invariant to prove it.<p>The easiest way I&#x27;ve seen to explain it is in the body of the executing loop you ask yourself, &quot;What has the loop done so far.&quot; An answer to that question should yield a loop invariant.",1411311638

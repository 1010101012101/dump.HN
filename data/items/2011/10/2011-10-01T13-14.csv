From what I've read and heard it's traditionally a similar in the US and it is obviously one of the killer features of Stripe.<p>Was it hard for you to work with a bank (Wells Fargo) on this?  From what I've heard banks are the main driver behind the 'shotgun' approach to information collection, at least here in Australia.  I could well be wrong on this, hence I ask the question.<p>You are already doing a much better job than traditional companies on both accounts, it's great to watch and I'm sure you guys will continue to do great work.<p>Note: I just realised my spelling error in my previous post...iPhone autocorrect got the better of me!a",1317477389

I don't even care if the screwdriver is rather boring.<p>Probably it is true for some products, but I think if you offer a great service or tool, people won't shun it just because it is boring. For example the tax industry is huge (in Germany anyway), software companies selling tax accounting software rake in the money.

Assuming a website where user impersonation is an issue (say, an auction site where a homoglyph attack could be used to scam a seller into sending the goods to a different address), one would need to blacklist all likely homoglyphs and duplicate characters, or just stick to ASCII.

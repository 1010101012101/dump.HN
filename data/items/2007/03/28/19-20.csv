Some of you might reply ""Paul Graham"". Well, I appreciate that, but it's wrong. The only resource needed to run a YC chapter that isn't abundant is <i>people with the enthusiasm and experience needed to guide young entrepreneurs</i>.<p>But what does YC produce? Exactly that.<p>Paul, you remarked lately that the reason you run YC is probably that you don't need money and do want to work with people you like. Well, take any hacker that has successfully sold a start up and he'd probably want the same.<p>So young hacker =} YC =} experienced entrepreneur {= YC<p>\nWhen I'll exit my business (or stabilize it and stay within), I'll call Paul and ask to found YC Israel. For now, I have other work to do :)<p>Aur Saraf",1175111920

Good presentation skills... Couldn't you just get a smooth talking MBA type? An MBA that is good with technology? A smooth talking engineer with an MBA?",1175111435

7011,comment,6924,6924,0,0,danielha,,,"Look at them so easily and distinctly categorize all the different spaces of the web. <p>I'm sure we'll be seeing plenty of successful startups that significantly overlap several of these categories. Don't look to strictly find a set that your company falls into; just solve a problem no one has adequately solved before.",1175111095

7008,comment,6990,6990,0,0,danielha,,,"This past ""startup"" weekend, we got a chance to bounce our idea off a bunch of different people. I got some really good feedback and wrote down every suggestion I received as soon as I could.<p>Let people know what you're doing so you know if you're doing something worthwhile. Remember: if they don't get what you're doing, it's certainly not <i>their</i> fault. Don't get haughty and cry that they're not sharing your vision. Let a potential user tell you what they want.",1175110636
7007,comment,6924,6924,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"That's a great post.  We all know that some places are overloaded, but it's nice to have a concise list like that.<p>Quality and differentiation usually win out though.  Hopefully somebody here is working in one of these areas and we can see it.  I guess heySan! and Zenter come to mind, now that I think of it.<p>",1175110381

7005,comment,6668,6997,0,0,dougo,,,"It's true that you don't have to prove yourself after the first semester of grad school, but there are many ""release""-like hoops you have to jump through in those 5+ years.  The main one is your thesis proposal.  I also had to do a plan of study a couple years before that; nowadays, my school (Northeastern) instead makes you publish a paper (and you're encouraged to publish multiple papers).   There's also all the things your advisor asks you to do as his research assistant, which isn't always directly connected to your thesis work.  <p>Your adviser, committee members, and conference/journal reviewers are all ""fickle customers"".  And these aren't customers who came to you because they want your product, these are more or less assigned to you and you're stuck with them (unless you change departments or schools).  It's true that you get a stipend, but I'm not sure that counts as ""full support"".  And while the drop-out rate is obviously lower than the startup failure rate, it's far from zero.<p>Still, I agree that grad school is less scary than a startup.  But don't think it's not all about pleasing others, with many non-trivial deadlines and constraints.",1175109670
7004,comment,6668,6945,0,0,Goladus,,,"Yes that is the interesting question, but how do you answer it?<p>By enumerating what you want and comparing that with the support and restriction a steady job offers.<p>",1175109097
7003,comment,6918,6978,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Not everything, though, is as blissful as it sounds. There are times when I wish I had taken the beating and went along with the standard template. I haven't told my parents that I have left university to pursue the startup dream...it wouldn't be wise to tell them unless <i>they</i> felt the opportunity cost of pursuing a startup is greater than getting a job. So every other day, they believe I leave off to study at my University when really I just go sit in the library and code Shuzak (our startup) :p This way, they will be really happy if I got accepted into YC but not disappointed if I didn't.<p>The consequence of having left University is that I am now super determined to make this successful; I have burned the ships behind me...so if our startup drowns, so will we.

7000,comment,6668,6928,0,0,Goladus,,,"I agree, I love working on hard problems.  Sort of.  What I've found is that I tend to make decisions for a variety of reasons, and am most decisive when I have a either broad convergence of motivation, or a singularly powerful one.<p>If you're asking yourself wether to pursue a job at google or starting a startup, you'll want to try enumerating as many reasons as you can for each one.  You won't likely get a definitive answer, but the excercise will get you thinking about what other things are important to you.  If you're lucky, one will turn up to be the obvious choice.<p>In my case, I have slid technically to the point that preparing for one is the same as preparing for the other. ",1175108503

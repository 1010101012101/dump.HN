The set of languages I am referring to is ""Business Basic"".  You can get more info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Basic<p>Most of the larger players are either non-existent, or have been bought out.  There are only a few major players left, http://pvx.com and http://pvxplus.com, http://www.thoroughbredsoftware.com/ and http://www.basis.com/<p>I was wondering, if I should create an interpreted business basic to complete, however make it like PHP (allow cgi sessions off of an apache server).  There is currently nothing like this now.  The majority of people using this, are pretty old (or ignorant), and wouldn't switch to Python, etc.<p>My biggest concern, is that there are really only about 3-5 million end users of programs that are created in Business Basic, guessing that there are probably 50,000 developers using these languages at most.  Should I enter a dieing but specialized market, or should I go back to the drawing board?",1282683505

that has value. But you have to tell people.<p>From a design perspective, your orange highlighted items look like links, but they are just highlights, so I'd look into fixing that, and I think you should move the sign-up to another page to give yourself more room to explain why your site is better than the rest.<p>Also, the problem (if I understand it right) is that most dating sites when they are just starting out don't have enough people on them, so I think you need to make sure you have people looking for dates, or good ways to invite people.
You need to make it look like the site has activity and that people are getting dates or looking at the available slots.<p>Also, that image of the perv grabbing that girl is really bad. I've always been surprised that dating sites use real people in the image rather than a silhouette where the person viewing the page can kinda see themselves in it.<p>Just my cents.",1282683319

1631050,comment,1625857,1627561,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Yes, problems in machine learning, computational statistics, data scientist or search engineer should be in 'statistics'.<p>But your generous attribution that this work now is actually statistics has a serious failing:  The backgrounds of both the students and the professors rarely have the prerequisites for making serious progress with statistics.<p>Maybe their work NEEDS 'statistics' but their backgrounds rarely permit them to make progress in 'statistics' even on the problems they are addressing.<p>E.g., I worked in one of the world's better artificial intelligence groups, and coming through were bright graduate students, part time, summer, etc. all awash in 'machine learning', etc.  The work was junk, and here's why:<p>There were some people in computer science departments who wanted some progress in something roughly related to computer software that 'learned' in some sense.  So, they tried things.  Mostly they tried just heuristics, especially ones they got from just maybe guessing at how humans did things.  Or for a while they were all hot on 'neural nets' -- promising for simulating a few neurons in an earthworm.  The criterion of progress was mostly just, did the resulting software appear to do something good?<p>Basically they were just starting with a blank slate and next to nothing significant in powerful background in anything.  About the deepest thing they knew was, maybe, LALR parsing.  They knew how to program computers but didn't know what to program.<p>In addition, and much more serious, there was a 'methodological gap' the width of the Pacific Ocean.  That criterion of, does the resulting software appear to do something good, is, in the history of statistics, applied math, pure math, and mathematical applications in physical science and engineering, just JUNK.  Such software might be this and that, but it's NOT 'statistics'.<p>Finally I had to explain to one of those intuition pushers:<p>Here's how to exploit mathematics to do applied problem solving.  In a transportation analogy, we start with a real problem a point A and we want to get to a real solution at point D.  For this trip we can start out walking, without a map, across deserts, rivers, swamps, and oceans, and maybe get to D.<p>But here's what we SHOULD do:  First get a taxi ride to a local airport Assumptions at B.  At B get a plane trip on Mathematics Airline to another airport Conclusions at C and close to D.  Then take a taxi to D.<p>The math connects the assumptions to the conclusions.  Here the math is based on theorems and proofs.  The taxi trips are supposed to be SHORT.<p>Then for the logical validity of the work, we get to check the math and then argue over the taxi trips.<p>The key is the math, and there we look carefully at assumption, theorems, proofs, and conclusions.<p>The 'research' content is new math for new connections for a new pair of assumptions and conclusions and, usually, a new pair of problem and solution.<p>To do such math, one needs a good background in math, typically an undergraduate major in pure math and about two years of graduate school in focused applicable math.  Of high importance will be the 'mathematical sciences' with probability (based on measure theory), statistics (also based on measure theory and functional analysis, e.g, for weak convergence and sufficient statistics), stochastic processes, especially Markov processes and martingales, and optimization, including combinatorial and stochastic.<p>E.g., without the first half of Rudin, 'Real and Complex Analysis', just F'GET about it; that material is not sufficient but it is NECESSARY.<p>As an example, once I took an important problem in practical computing and executed the 'methodology' above.  I got some nice results for the real problem and, really, a nice step forward for computer science.  My paper connected carefully with instances of the real problem and with real data, but the core of the work was the new theorems and proofs.<p>So, I went to get the paper reviewed.  I got back from two chaired professors of computer science at famous research universities and editors in chief of top computer science journals essentially the same wording, ""Neither I nor anyone on my board of editors has the background to review the math in your paper."".  For a third such person, I wrote them tutorial notes for two weeks before they gave up.  At one journal, the editor gave up but the editor in chief stepped in and handled the paper himself.  Likely the computer science people he asked said, ""It's nice for practical computing and computer science, but I can't say if the math is correct."", and likely math professors said, ""The math is correct, but I don't know what it means for computer science."".<p>Broadly, so far research computer science can rarely do research in applied math or mathematical statistics.  A Ph.D. in computer science just does not have the right prerequisites for such research.  The prerequisites are a focused applied math Ph.D.  Sorry 'about that.  So, yes, for broad areas of needed research progress in computer science, the computer science community is essentially irrelevant.<p>As I said, for 'statistics', the computer science people are limited to intuitive heuristics and picking formulas they don't understand out of elementary stat books, and that is like snake oil cooked up on a wood stove.  Again:  The reason is, they don't have the prerequisites.<p>Uh, my paper could have been called 'machine learning' or 'artificial intelligence', but I just called it some theorems and proofs for some progress in computer science for an important problem in practical computing.  It would also be appropriate to call the work some nice progress in mathematical statistics.",1282682050

1631010,comment,1629794,1629794,0,0,korch,,,"Gravity just might be the most interesting thing out there, second only to Prime Numbers, IMNSHO. As a fledgling ""amateur-mathematician"" (don't ask), I am astonished that centuries after the Newtonian Revolution kicked off all of science, we still don't <i>know</i> what underlies the very basis of Newton's discovery. Even today, measure the amount of ""force"" of gravity on very large or small scales is damned near impossible. But we must believe in it nonetheless!<p>We sure take a lot of our hindsight knowledge for granted.<p>What is gravity? We sure think we have pinned it down because we can measure its effects on very precise scales. But measuring a thing is not at all the same as understanding a thing, in a teleological sense. I am not a physicist, but then again, I'm pretty sure most physicists are equally in the dark about what gravity is, so there's little harm to be done firing blindly in the dark.<p>The way I understand it so far, the <i>explanation</i> of gravity is intimately tied into the way we measure, model and predict the behavior of gravity. And all of that is equivalent to our mathematical formulation of gravity.<p>Newton was fortunate enough that the precision of measurements in his era were orders of magnitudes worse than now. So he could create calculus to explain his notion of gravitational force, assuming all space and time in the universe were a single, absolute ""reference frame"", and not run into any real problems. I've always seen the creation of the calculus and the formulation of the central force field hypothesis as being flip sides of the same coin—without the notion of one, you would never arrive at the idea of the other. So that's one way of <i>explaining</i> it.<p>In Netwon's day, the primary objection to gravity was that you had to believe in ""action-at-a-distance"", and that the force of gravity ""travels"" instantaneously across the entire Universe. I don't recall, but there was some Aristotilean or Scholastic hang-up on this point. And we still have this problem—it'sonly slightly alleviated by General Relativity sweeping it under the rug of ""things-we-can't-hope-to-measure-until-we-get-intergalactic-starships""<p>Einstein's genius lay in being a great connector of existing ideas. He managed to take Newton's gravity, a dash of Bolztmann's atomic hypothesis & statistical mechanics, a pinch of Riemann's non-euclidean metrical ideas, and notice the very staggering pattern that Lorentz transforms and Minkowski space on paper exactly match how gravity appears to work, even with relaxing Newton's assumption of a single, universe-wide, unchanging space-time. It does seem far, far too convenient that of all the possible models the Universe could take, it ""chose"" to make gravity appear locally Euclidean, yet globally Minkowski, and that the hyperbolic metric of non-euclidean geometry can be made to exactly model the behavior of gravity in non-inertial-frames. All of that <i>explanation</i> exists only on paper too.<p>As an aside, I cannot recommend this book enough for a not-too-difficult, motivated-sophomore-level calculus based explanation of gravity—just 60 pages in and you will ""get it"", as least the bigger picture of gravity: The Geometry of Spacetime: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity

He spends a lot of time picking apart Newton's conceptual problems with gravity. It's like looking over Newton's shoulder, with added commentary, so you can glimpse a lot more about the weird nature of gravity without being drowned in mathematical equations.<p>So again, the explanation is almost entirely mathematical. While this may turn off a lot of folks who (incorrectly) believe they can never understand enough calculus to even glimpse what Newton & Einstein were saying, I personally believe the opposite—wanting to know what gravity really is serves as a great motivation for <i>learning more math</i>
Which everyone ought to do!<p>It was about 6 months ago that a paper was published(and linked to on HN) saying no separate effect of gravity could be detected even right down to the Planck scale(the smallest theoretical ""distances"" we can ever hope to measure!). Gravity, being the weakest of the 4 forces, is even weaker than we thought, and yet it is the ""prime mover"" of the entire Universe. If gravity cannot be easily detected even on the Planck scale, this is going to be a huge, huge problem in figuring out gravity. What the gist of the experiment seemed to suggest is that we have no hope of ever detecting ""gravitons."" I am not a physicist, so I may not fully understand this new research, but I think that's what it was implying if you read between the lines.<p>We may never know what gravity is. But I would say it's all about the journey anyways, and never the destination. So all of the mathematics you have to pick up along the way to grok that we don't know what gravity is, is itself of more possible value than knowing what gravity really is.

The premise was that Ruby and Rails have made web development easier and more accessible to less technical people.  He argued that there is a limit to how low you could lower the bar because, at a certain point, your application is all about the thousands of little decisions that your code describes.<p><i>""There is a natural, physical limit where at the end programming is just choices.  How should the program work?  What should happen when you click this button?  Those choices are ultimately the key to programming - and you can't get out of that.  Which is also why it's a bit of a pipe dream to think that 'oh, there's going to be these magical new environments where somebody that knows nothing about programming will be able to just drag and drop a few things into a box and then voila! you'll have the most amazing program in the world.  No. It's really not going to happen like that because in order to have the most amazing program in the world, you have to care about a thousand decisions and recording those thousand decisions takes a programming language. So, there is a lower limit to how simple it can get.""</i><p>The reason why a technical co-founder is so necessary is because every application is going to have thousands of little decisions that you are describing in your code.<p>A technical co-founder doesn't need to know everything about computer science.  They need to be able to describe those decisions.  Often times, if you're hiring a programmer to implement your idea, you don't actually describe things accurately.  You come up with things to say like, ""show the article to people who are interested in it.""  What does that statement mean?  Do you email the article to interested people?  Does it show up on the homepage for those people?  A special page?  How do you identify ""interested people""?  It keeps going on.  Even ""simple"" things are often complex - especially if you're implementing a niche application.<p>You can create mockups, you can list ""requirements"", you can have the programmer ping you when they have questions, but ultimately programmers aren't translators.  Programmers, in order to be successful, <i>must</i> be able to make those decisions or you'll die a death of a thousand cuts as they ping you over every little decision.  The problem is that people have an idea in their head that they think just needs to get ""translated"" into computer-speak.  However, in reality, they've yet to describe most of what's in their head - if the minute details are there at all.<p>Even if none of that co-founder's code make it past the first few months, they're able to describe the choices in an unambiguous way that mockups, emails, requirement specs, etc. simply don't.<p>Basically, not having a technical founder means that you don't have any founder that can describe the application in the detail that's required to create something really great. It doesn't mean it's impossible and that's not to say that input from non-technical co-founders isn't important or that they can't have as meaningful an impact as technical co-founders.  It means that if you're two non-technical co-founders looking to start something good, you probably need to bring on a third co-founder who is technical because you need someone you feel comfortable with making those little decisions and working with as a peer rather than in a hierarchical way.  Because they're going to have to work on all those little decisions with you that mockups and specs just never address.<p>Code is a way of describing all those little ways in which your application works, not translating an idea into computer-speak.",1282680027

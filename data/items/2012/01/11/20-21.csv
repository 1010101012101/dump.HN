3453606,comment,3452908,3452908,116,0,tptacek,,,"Or, ""How not to make money selling software: a succinct illustration of cost-based and market-based (specifically, value-based) pricing in just two comment threads.""<p>Why can Github charge FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR for a local install of Github and succeed, impressively so, despite a small army of nerds pointing out how inexpensive it is to run one's own Git server and Gitorious? Why does 37signals have an office with walls made of 37signalsium (really, seen it, it's fuzzy) and trendy furniture despite selling software that the nerdosphere can clearly duplicate? Why does Yammer even consider publishing a $5/user/month price for software that is among every web geek's top-5-most-likely-personal projects?<p>Answer: they don't sell gypsum.<p>Cost based pricing, which works for gypsum sales but not so much for software, suggests that the price of a nice photo should be the price of the gas to get to and from the photo shoot, possibly divided by the number of people interested in buying the photo, plus maybe throw a couple bucks in there and buy yourself something nice, photographer.<p>Value-based pricing says, ""how much it cost me to create the photo is <i>irrelevant</i>"". YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES, say the nerds. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SAYING! But value-based pricing continues: ""no, what matters is how much it would cost <i>you</i> to make that photo and how much benefit it brings"".<p>How much it would cost <i>you</i> to make that photo: (say) $6000, perhaps divided by the number of different photos you'd take given the same setup (but then also scaled back up to account for the headcount or professional services required to take lots of pictures).<p>How much benefit? It depends. I could take 10,000 words listing out factors in figuring it out. Most importantly: what are the substitutes to this photo and how much do they cost? For some businesses, clip art of the Eiffel Tower suffices to bring 80-90% of the value. For others (like ad-sales print publications), comparables might also be very expensive.<p>Now, the extent to which the YOUR business benefit from my photo exceeds MY cost to produce the photo is MY ADVANTAGE IN PRODUCING PHOTOS (the extent to which your <i>cost</i> exceeds <i>my</i> cost is my ""comparative advantage"", and if it's a positive number possibly suggests that I'm the one who should be doing the photos in any case, since you have better ways to put your money to use). Having an advantage is a <i>good thing</i>. Among other things, it's a key reason why software startups are lucrative, and why we don't all work on line-of-business software for non-software companies.<p>It's probably true that a photo of a sunset isn't worth $6,000. But, exclusivity aside, the value of the photo also has nothing to do with how much it cost the photographer to take each shot at the margin, and it has nothing to do with the cost to make each marginal sale. What matters is how much it costs the <i>customer</i> to replace that value with a substitute, and in that analysis the $6000 set-up cost, while not determinative, is relevant perspective.<p>The moralism in these threads is an irrelevant sideshow. Situationally, the nerdosphere oscillates between extremes when trying to compute valuations for stuff with intangible-seeming benefits. Today, the nerdosphere apparently thinks either (a) every photo is a precious snowflake or (b) photo costs should be scaled by the current price of hard disk storage. Yesterday, it was whether it's right for Github to charge per repo. Before that, it's whether it's fair to have markets for spec work like 99designs.<p>None of that matters. What matters is, is there a market for what you're selling, and will it clear based on the model you use to price stuff on the market. Clearly there is a market for high-quality photography. Clearly it is not a cost-based market like gypsum, or there would not exist sites selling photos with royalties attached, or photos costing hundreds of dollars --- which clearly those sites do exist. So instead of arguing about how much photos should cost --- because, again, they cost what the market says they cost, not what you think it costs to make them yourself --- think instead about how this discussion applies to your own work product. More than you think it does, is my guess.<p> <i>(Actually this isn't all what comparative advantage is; comparative advantage says, if there's a market for widgets and a market for photos and you're better at widgets than photos and I'm better at photos than widgets, then I should do widgets and you should do photos, which is a subtly different idea, but the point stands either way.)</i>",1326314892

3453602,comment,3452908,3453337,8,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I would like help understanding this since it runs very counter to my understanding.<p>As I understand the economics of the photography market, there are several factors at work.<p>1) Equipment - this affects the source quality of a picture and thus how it will look when reproduced. Early on a limiting factor was very 'slow' film requiring long exposures, and also limits of grain size which required larger surface area to achieve line density that made it still look OK when enlarged for publication or posters.<p>Technology has really worked on this constraint, the latest tweak being large format digital sensors that can take 3 pictures of exceptional clarity in low light. This hugely reduced the 'cost' of quality both from an overall light capture sense, and in the opportunity sense where you can take 15 exposures where you might used to take exactly one and thus have a higher probability of getting the picture you like at the lighting opportunity rather than 'missing it' and having to go back the next day/year/whatever (sorry and that relates mostly to outdoor photography)<p>2) Population of quality photographers. This has been perhaps the most amazing impact of digital photography for me. Generally you get 'good' at taking pictures by taking a lot of pictures and seeing which are good and which aren't. In the film days there was a financial burden due to film developing and printing images which was a prerequisite to getting 'good' at photography.<p>Today you can take a thousand pictures a week in a variety of settings and environments, you can display them instantly 'poster' sized on a 55"" 1080p television you can print ones you like at home on an ink jet printer up to 13 x 19. The change I see there is that for only an investment of time, one can practice photography. This has hugely expanded the number of people who have taken thousands of photographs. Combined with the internet (more on that shortly) and the community groups which provide feedback the number of quality photographers who are taking pictures is higher now than it has ever been.<p>3) Distribution and Discovery - prior to the Internet photographers had gallery showings, or they did freelance work for periodicals, or they were hired by advertising or modelling agencies. Finding them was 'hard' in the sense you needed a hook into the community and for photographers 'being found' was hard. Thus the 'known' good photographer pool was always smaller than the 'actual' good photographer pool. People who were 'known' reaped the benefit of that as there was an opportunity cost of trying to find another photographer once you had already found one.<p>The Internet changed all of that, you can find galleries 'online' in Flickr albums, G+ feeds, Facebook pages, blogs, etc etc. So in the past when someone found a photographer and they were thrilled to have found one, they were not in a very strong bargaining position if they thought the price being charged was high, since the cost of finding another photographer was higher still. But now that the cost of finding a photographer is much much lower, and the number of quality photographers is much much higher. The availability of good quality photographs has exploded.<p>The impact of that explosion is that it is impossible to sustain a price point that was established in a time of scarcity during a time of plenty.<p>So ripping off a photo is now 'easy' in the sense that people copy an image from a web site or off a flickr feed etc and don't pay the photographer. Of the cases I've read about on the web they have always been one of two situations: \n1) The person doing the copying didn't realize what they were doing was illegal and once informed either:\n a) Licensed the photograph\n b) Used a different photograph because they felt the asking\n    price exceeded their internal notion of 'value' with\n    respect to using the photo.\n2) The person doing the copying knew they were ripping it off and if they are caught they just move to a different picture. In every case I've read about if the photographer has to resort to suing the infringer they have always won.<p>The important point for me has been that 'getting photos ripped off' has not been a money losing proposition unless the photographer did nothing, and I do recognize that having to be your own police with respect to people stealing your work is a pain.<p>The second issue of people giving away their work losing 'everybody' money seems even more perplexing. That the price you can charge for a photo has gone down as more people have entered the market can in fact grow the overall market. On a per transaction basis the market value of a photograph may be lower, but those lower prices cause more people to buy photographs, thus increasing the total economic value. To the extent that photographers are good at educating consumers of photographs that licenses are involved and they should seek out a license that is good for everyone.<p>I don't see this as a 'tragedy of the commons' rather as a an increase in efficiency of the market to match up good photographs with consumers of same. To the extent that it causes people to 'go out of business' and thus reduce the supply is the counter to an infinite supply of free photos.",1326314834

IMHO, there is a _serious_ problem with content. I helped my niece with her algebra and could not believe how much useless junk was cluttering the textbook. Every few pages had the ""USA Today"" logo (in ""real-world example"" problems) and some reference to an insipid product called ""foldables"" (special note-taking paper). The beginning of the book had literally pages of the head-shots/bios of the dozen+ ""authors"" of the textbook. The whole thing was a designed-by-committee train-wreck. It would be laughable were it not for the fact that our students will have to compete in the global economy after being trained by materials like this.<p>My concern is that app-textbook development will not resolve the intrinsic problems that textbooks have with their content. The textbook vendors go out of their way to pander to whatever the school boards want out of their textbooks (without regard to the fact that it is often half-baked).

For example, rather than suggesting that women are 'fearful' of text interfaces, the author observes that their continuing popularity in the FLOSS community exacerbates past educational disparities: 'Instead of deducting from biological sex difference, the phenomenon suggests a lingering deficiency of womens IT education and women-unfriendly products and tools.'

Honeycomb is the first OS designed for tablets and yet the original 7 has not seen it. There are no technical limitations to the 7 that would preclude it from receiving the much needed Honeycomb update, but it has not seen it. Nor do I believe that it will see it. Further, there was just a big media blow up about the fact that the existing Samsung phone that is very similar to the Google sanctioned phone in specs, will not receive the Ice Cream Sandwich update. I am sorry but for me personally the 7 just now getting updated to 2.3.6 is a little to late. I bough one, and learned my lesson, If I had known that the end of life would have been in the 2.x branch of Android, I would have made a different purchasing decision. I expect my devices to become obsolete due to hardware limitations, with the device no longer being able to support the current OS and not by arbitrary limitations placed on it by a vendor. It's Samsung's prerogative if they want to handle their affairs in such a manner, but for me personal that is not the kind of vendor I want for my equipment. I like Android and have been contemplating a switch from my iPhone, but until I can find a vendor that will supply recent OS advancements, until my hardware is obsolete, I am forced to stick with Apple who has done a pretty good job of it.

By talented individuals charging less-nothing for some of their photos (likely already taken photos) instead of consuming and annihilating the shared resource of ""money available to be spent on photography"" they just move that around. This ""don't give your photo away, or charge lower prices"" argument is the same as all of the other NO!SPEC, anti-open-source/public domain/CC arguments, in that it's a bad argument.<p>Free and open source software is pretty well understood. For example, by having all of these quality web browsers for free, it allows a larger market for more companies to make more money selling their wares and services online. I believe the original argument against free browsers was something like, ""free web browsers will cost jobs and lower the quality of the browser.""<p>Whenever I read the articles or come across an individual that trashes students and amateurs for giving their work away I think a few things.<p>- Does this person really not understand that by Timmy the undergrad giving the bake sale a good, but not astounding, photo of a cupcake that it frees them, the professional, up to take photos of tiger sharks?<p>- Is this person actually just incapable of competing on quality or subject matter with amateurs and therefor unable to differentiate themselves?",1326313133

The intuition is that if a work is kept sufficiently private, it is not involved in a substitutable market for similar items. If it is made sufficiently public, then it is competing in a market for other substitutable creative goods of the same sort. Another intuition is that there's a threshold of publicness after which it becomes fair to assume that the rightsholder is interested in wide distribution more than controlling use, or that after a certain threshold of publicness, a creative product has been introduced into the public sphere as a cultural artifact that others ought to be able to use freely.<p>Right now all we have is a binary move from rightsholder-retains-complete-rights to public domain, which has led to the craziness of current copyright law.

And third, I simply don't see Samsung having the level of consumer trust that Apple has.  People that follow these things may know a lot about Samsung, but most people I know don't care about the difference between Samsung, Vizio, or any of the other brands of TVs that line the walls of Best Buy. Sony once had a distinct advantage in consumer trust, but I don't know if they still do, having gone so long without standing out. Once upon a time, I wouldn't own a TV if it wasn't a Trinitron.  Now? I just look at the specs and assume the manufacturer is fungible.",1326312412

Great looking website and nice user experience for publishing.<p>Posting the service on HN is one of those things I wish I had thought of a few months ago, I still have a lot to learn - thankfully a friend sent me this link since he knew what we were doing.  TainoApp (<a href=""http://gettainoapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettainoapp.com</a>) does all that (Wordpress to native iOS app), plus full platform support for Windows Phone 7, and Android (wrapping up Blackberry and MeeGo support as of this posting) you can see it at work here - <a href=""http://goo.gl/nuZcm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/nuZcm</a>.  So far, it seems we're the only ones that can do Windows Phone 7 - hopefully someone in the community can point out other projects we haven't heard from that already does it, so that we can continue learning from others.<p>We have the tech specs ready for implementing support for most of the CMSs out there (Tumblr, Posterous, and others including Tresite - heavily used in latinamerica), but decided to focus on Wordpress installs first since the install base was larger we were able to churn out an mvp faster since we were more familiar with the wp architecture.<p>Our focus had been on engaging one on one with customers and quietly testing out different revenue models - but this kind of torrent of feedback would have been truly welcome.  It wasn't until the start of the new year that we decided to test an introductory offer for the platform - aimed at the latinamerican market first (it's google translate friendly - <a href=""http://goo.gl/Y5JZL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/Y5JZL</a>). I felt we were missing a lot of the features I wanted, so I held back from doing a public push to get feedback - that was a big mistake.  Seeing everyone's comments for Appifier has been an uplifting experience - so keep at it!!! One of the toughest things I've felt is being out there and being open to scrutiny by other startups. Maybe we can chat sometime and talk a bit more about some of the mistakes we've done along the way - drop me a line at jramphis at gettainoapp dot com. Best of luck!",1326312338

In every case I can recall, if random access by UTF-8 offset wasn't the right thing (which it usually was), then random access by code point wouldn't be either. Almost all string offsets you'll ever have to deal with come from having a program look at a string, and in that case, you can just use UTF-8 byte offsets. What sort of text processing are you doing where this isn't the case?<p>As for East Asian text, you have a point: it <i>will</i> usually be shorter in UTF-16 than UTF-8. Before making this decision, though, ask yourself how much that extra space is worth to you. Is it worth dealing with possible encoding hassles? (The answer to this may be yes, but it's a question that should be asked.) Also, on a lot of data, there are many characters from the ASCII range mixed in with the East Asian text. I did an experiment a while back where I downloaded some random web pages in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Farsi, and compared their size in UTF-8 and UTF-16.

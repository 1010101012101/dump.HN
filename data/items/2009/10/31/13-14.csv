913532,comment,913516,913516,0,0,antirez,,,"There is some problem with the numbers for Redis:<p>""Can do 19,600 gets and 13,900 sets a second on a MacBook Pro""<p>In my macbook (not PRO) Redis performs like this:<p><pre><code>    % ./redis-benchmark -q\n    SET: 34705.88 requests per second\n    GET: 31055.90 requests per second\n    INCR: 28739.25 requests per second\n    LPUSH: 35013.98 requests per second\n    LPOP: 30496.95 requests per second\n    ^C\n</code></pre>\nBut redis <i>sucks</i> on Mac OS X compared to how it performs on Linux. The same macbook running Linux reaches almost 100k query/sec. An entry level server running Linux is in the 150k/sec zone.<p>Sorry but I spent some time in order to make Redis so fast, so to see numbers an order of magnitude less does not make me happy ;)<p>About the replication: Redis supports master-slave replication with very very fast first synchronization. The replication is non-blocking, this means that if you attach N slaves to the master it continues to reply to clients without troubles when synching with the slaves.<p>If the link between master and slaves goes down the two will resynchronize again automatically. It's possible to use a replica in order to enhance data durability.<p>Replication can be controlled at runtime. For instance if you want an instance to become a replica of another instance all you need to do is something like this:<p><pre><code>    echo -e ""slaveof 1.2.3.4 6379\r\n"" | nc 1.1.1.1 6379\n</code></pre>\nFinal note about the snapshotting persistence mode, in Redis edge on git there is already support for append-only journal, that makes Redis an option even when data is very important.",1256997427

That was probably a year ago; it seemed like it wasn't mature enough for what we were looking for.<p>The problem is, I'd love to use python/django or ruby/rails, but it's a hard pitch to the boss if the platform we're looking at doesn't start off with many features.  He really wants to avoid reinventing the wheel as much as possible.<p>I've heard what you're saying about Magento around the web quite a bit; that the way it's laid out makes it very hard to work on, and that it can be very slow.  I think if a django/rails project started off pretty close to what we were looking for, we could implement the missing features ourselves in less time than it would take to work in PHP, simply because of developer productivity increases in those languages/frameworks.<p>Anyway, I'll take another look at Satchmo and see where it's at.  I'd really love to avoid getting into another huge PHP mess again.",1256996716

""<p>There aren't many other topics that have such a far-reaching effect on so many people, and have such a large body of scientific (and otherwise) research behind it. As such it doesn't just appeal to my intellectual curiosity (although it does), it also concerns me on a far more 'real' level of realising that decisions I make now will have serious effects on people all around the world - many of whom will be much less able, due to geography, politics and finance, to adapt to the changes that will occur.<p>To my mind the science will appeal to many hackers.\nAnd the many solutions that will be required are extremely suited to the startup culture and the hacker mindset.",1256996495

Parsing requires arbitrary look-ahead and semantic pass, order of headers inclusion matters, #if and dirty tricks are everywhere<p>- compilation is slow<p>- non standard extensions makes painful portable C++ across compilers and platform, because you need them and they can have incompatible syntax<p>- C++ const is useless when it comes to optimization or concurrency.<p>- any real world project involving C++ is going to be challenging if you're not working with top C++ library implementers or emasculating rules (like ""no exceptions"" or ""nothing goes in the constructor"" at Google)<p>Anyway, even if C++1x was already here and completely supported (which C++03 is not), D would still have an edge.<p>Despite its current problems D greatly enhance productivity over C++. Refactoring is _way_ faster when you have import and no headers to maintain. Properties enhance expressivity a lot. You have access to the machine, value semantics, and reference returns, so there is nothing conceptually wrong with it.<p>Also, in D there is much less skill diffference between library writers and typical programmers as compared to C++.<p>Finally if you really want C++1x features, I sincerely advises to try D because there is a lot of overlapping.",1256995261

10302404,comment,10300213,10300213,0,0,Kutta,,,"This post engages in plenty of armchair speculation, and is overall horribly vague, or just nonsense (&quot;addOneTwo works on any type that’s provably isomorphic to Integer&quot;). It&#x27;s more like a plea for all things that seem intuitively nice and good, mashed together without any deep consideration for whether they can be realized consistently. Type classes are still an open research topic, especially when combined with dependent types. From the top of my head:<p>Class coherence is the property that any two instances of the same types are equal. It&#x27;s a strong guarantee that boosts the robustness and usability of type classes significantly. Scala doesn&#x27;t have it, instead it has a arcane set of rules that determine the resolution of implicits in the face of ambiguity, and it&#x27;s a huge pain for more complicated use cases.<p>Named instances are incompatible with coherence. We could just put one named instance into a runtime object, and voila, it&#x27;s indistinguishable from any other instance. We could remedy this by indexing the type of an instance with a label, which isn&#x27;t better than choosing instances with newtype wrappers.<p>Similarly, local instances and explicit instance application imply incoherence.<p>Also, laws for classes are an already existing feature in Idris, Agda and Coq. The problem is that laws for anything are by far best realized via dependent types, and dependent types have a nontrivial interaction with classes that is an open problem. With dependent types, checking whether two instance heads are different could be just undecidable, depending on what constructs one allows there.<p>It&#x27;s a possibility to neuter the language fragment that goes into instance heads, so that propositional equality becomes decidable over it - in a way Haskell already does this, by disallowing type families in instances. But in a dependent language it could be rather awkward that a fair amount of useful types cannot be made instances.<p>Alternatively, one could require proofs from the <i></i>programmer<i></i> in each instance that the instance head is propositionally different from all other instance heads in scope. But this would also require much thought, and I haven&#x27;t given it yet.<p>Also, if our classes are actually coherent, we would like to have an internal proof of this property (as opposed to in current Haskell where we just sort of know that this is the case), but I have no idea how to do this best. Maybe the instance resolution procedure could be modeled internally in a strong enough language, and coherence could be given as a theorem, and there could be some syntactic sugar for code with classes.<p>Or we could have both coherent and incoherent classes, each explicitly marked as such. Or we could have coherent classes by <i></i>proving<i></i> that a certain class is necessarily coherent, independently from any instance resolution procedure. There are many such classes, but not nearly all that we frequently use, and some classes are coherent but we can&#x27;t prove it in currently implemented type theories because the proof relies on parametricity (Functor is such a class).",1443599411

Not using bitcode allows you to select optimization options and have a &quot;receipt&quot; on what CPU:s your code will run, by providing those slices. Now, Apple can also (in theory at least) change endianness of the target code.

I&#x27;d imagine there&#x27;s still risks, like hitting someone, or a curb, where a helmet might come in life-saving.<p>There are still risks, but serious cycling injuries and deaths are massively dominated by bycycle-car interactions.   Theory being that on a bike... I&#x27;m usually going under 20mph,  So the force involved in a single-vehicle crash is whatever energy that 20mph imparts to my 200lbs of flesh, rubber, carbon and aluminum.   Yeah, it <i>can</i> kill you, but usually doesn&#x27;t.<p>If you are hit by a car, first, the thing is quite often going faster than 20mph, and the mass involved is at least one order of magnitude greater.   That&#x27;s a lot more energy to dissipate into the soft and crunchy cyclist.<p>cars make the roads very dangerous for anyone not in a car.<p>All that said, I personally wear a full-face helmet on my commute, even though nearly all of it is on a nearly empty mixed-use path that prohibits cars.   Yes, without cars, helmet or no, I&#x27;m a lot less likely to die.   But even if the energy involved is all my own, I&#x27;d much rather crash while wering a serious helmet than with a bare head.<p>I use a bell super 2r mips, and I keep the chinbar on.  I&#x27;ve already had one accident (as a child, colliding with another bicycle) where I landed on my helmet and my front teeth.   Fortunately for me, I kind of had a bugs bunny thing going, and so the Dentist just evened out the jagged bits of my front teeth, and my mouth probably ended up looking better for it, but yeah, I&#x27;d rather not repeat that.<p>I don&#x27;t think the chinbar is likely to save my life; the jaw provides a reasonable crumple-zone to protect the brain if the jaw hits first, but the chinbar will save me, in case of a crash where I land on my chin, a whole lot of pain, medical expense, and possibly missed work.<p>My general attitude is that a helmet isn&#x27;t that big of a deal to wear, and it significantly decreases the seriousness of injuries I might receive while cycling.   Further, if I am going to bother to wear the helmet (most of the cost is in the inconvenience of carrying it, for me.  For most people, there&#x27;s a cost in terms of style, but I&#x27;m wearing cargo shorts already.)  I don&#x27;t see any reason to buy any but the most protective helmet that I can get that doesn&#x27;t interfere with my cycling (for example, it needs adequate ventilation; thus you don&#x27;t see me busting out my arai)  - You can get a real top-end bicycle helmet for two hundred bucks; Considering what medical care costs, one crash is gonna pay for a lifetime of really nice helmets.<p>To be clear, this is what I do to protect <i>my</i> head, (and my face)  - I don&#x27;t mean to tell other people what they should do with their head.",1443598293

Even considering that I cycle commuted in all of the aforementioned cities, just the convenience of not needing a car (nor uber or taxis for that matter) led to a lot more walking above and beyond my natural recreational activity which I would find a way to do anywhere I lived.  It&#x27;s hard to quantify, but it&#x27;s very very real.  In the US there are very few places where you can live and not feel severely restricted without a car—you can do it in New York, and you can sort of get away with it in SF (although a lot of people&#x27;s lifestyles would collapse if they had to give up their Uber and Lyft to instead rely on Muni)—but most places metros are tiny or non-existent, and buses are primarily used by the poor and have terrible service.  There&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that this has huge impacts on public health, but of course it&#x27;s impossible to isolate the effect and quantify it since countries that do these things differently have all sorts of confounding cultural differences.",1443597929

10302295,comment,10301800,10301800,0,0,HSO,,,"Sorry for the wall of text but this passage from Kundera [1] always comes to mind when I realize (or remember) that noise, somehow, is taken for granted by most people I know: I complain, and they say &quot;stop whining&quot;. But it <i>is</i> extraordinary and should not be accepted as a &quot;fact of life&quot;. Here&#x27;s to hope that events like this will make more people aware of that.<p><i>“Another visit to Prague after 1989. From a friend’s bookcase I happen to pull out a book by Jaromir John, a Czech novelist of the period between the wars. The book is long forgotten; it is called The Internal-Combustion Monster, and I read it for the first time that day. Written around 1932, it tells a story set about ten years earlier, during the first years of the Czechoslovak Republic that was proclaimed in 1918. A Mr. Engelbert, a forestry official in the old regime of the Hapsburg monarchy, moves to Prague to live out his retirement years; but coming up against the aggressive modernity of the young state, he has one disappointment after another. A highly familiar situation. One “aspect, though, is brand new: for Mr. Engelbert the horror of this modern world, the curse, is not the power of money or the arrogance of the arrivistes, it is the noise; and not the age-old noise of a thunderstorm or a hammer, but the new noise of engines, especially of automobiles and motorcycles, the explosive “internal-combustion monsters.”</i><p><i>Poor Mr. Engelbert: first he settles in a house in a residential neighborhood; there cars are his first introduction to the evil that will turn his life into an unending flight. He moves to another neighborhood, pleased to see that cars are forbidden entry to his street. Unaware that the prohibition is only temporary, he is exasperated at night when he hears the “internal-combustion monsters” roaring again beneath his window. From then on he never goes to bed without cotton in his ears, realizing that “sleeping is the most basic human desire and that death caused by the impossibility of sleep must be the worst death there is.” He goes to seek silence in country inns (in vain), in provincial cities in the houses of onetime colleagues (in vain), and ends up spending his nights in trains, which “, with their gentle archaic noise, provide him with a slumber that is relatively peaceful in his life as a beleaguered man.</i><p><i>When John wrote his novel, Prague had probably one car to every hundred inhabitants or, I don’t know, perhaps to every thousand. It is precisely when it was still rare that the phenomenon of noise (motor noise) stood out in all its astonishing newness. We can deduce a general rule: the existential import of a social phenomenon is most sharply perceptible not as it expands but when it is just beginning, incomparably fainter than it will soon become. Nietzsche remarks that in the sixteenth century nowhere in the world was the Church less corrupt than in Germany and that was the reason the Reformation started precisely there, because the mere “beginnings of corruption were felt to be intolerable.” Bureaucracy in Kafka’s time was an innocent babe compared to today, and yet it was Kafka who revealed its monstrous nature, which since then has become routine and no longer commands anyone’s interest. In the 1960s brilliant philosophers subjected the “consumer society” to a critique that over the years has been so cartoonishly outstripped by reality that we are embarrassed “to refer to it. For we must recall another general rule: reality is utterly unashamed to repeat itself, but confronted with reality’s repetition, thought always ends by falling silent.</i><p><i>In 1920 Mr. Engelbert was still astonished by the noise of the “internal-combustion monsters”; the generations that followed found it natural; after initially horrifying man, sickening him, noise gradually reshaped him; through its omnipresence and its permanence it ultimately instilled in him the need for noise, and with that, a whole different relation to nature, to repose, to joy, to beauty, to music (which, now become an uninterrupted background of sound, has lost its char“acter as art) and even speech (which no longer holds a privileged position in the world of sounds). In the history of existence this was a change so profound, so enduring, that no war or revolution can produce its like; a change whose beginnings Jaromir John modestly noted and described.</i><p><i>I say “modestly” because John was one of those novelists called “minor”; still, great or small, he was a real novelist; he was not just copying truths stitched on the curtain of preinterpretation; he had the Cervantes-like courage to tear the curtain. Let’s take Mr. Engelbert out of the novel and imagine him as a real man who sets about writing his autobiography; no, it is nothing like John’s novel! For, like most of his ilk, Mr. Engelbert is accustomed to judging life according to what can be read on that curtain hanging in front of the world; he knows that the phenomenon of noise, however disagreeable it is for him, does not deserve interest. But freedom, independence, democracy—or, seen from the opposite angle, capitalism, exploitation, inequality—yes, oh a hundred times yes! Now, those are serious notions, they can give a life meaning, render a misfortune “noble! Thus, in his autobiography, which I envision him writing with cotton stuffed in his ears, he grants great significance to the recovered independence of his homeland, and he rails at the selfishness of the arrivistes; as for those “internal-combustion monsters,” he has relegated them to the bottom of the page, a mere mention of a trivial annoyance that, in the end, is rather amusing.</i><p>PS: Much like Mr. Engelbert, I resorted to ear plugs, going through all the varieties of it as well as noise canceling headphones. Since about 1.5 years now, I use custom-fitted silicone earplugs and they are amazing. Each ear canal is shaped differently, even &quot;within&quot; the same person from side to side, and a custom fitting makes earplugs most agreeable to wear. I highly recommend this if you suffer from a &quot;too noisy world&quot; like me. They are expensive but the fit and apparent durability make them worth it. One of the best investments in my sanity I&#x27;ve made (so far).<p>_________________________<p>[1] M. Kundera. The Curtain (Le rideau). Harper Perennial, 2005.",1443597572

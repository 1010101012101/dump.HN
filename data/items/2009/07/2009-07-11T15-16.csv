Instead of dropping one in the eye, blow up several nukes around it.<p>Another point to consider is we can try to use a nuclear explosion in order to prevent a hurricane from forming if we catch it early enough. Is that possible?<p>I do doubt that we can routinely nuke hurricanes (even ignoring the radiation effects), but looking at just the mechanical effects, I think it would be interesting to take another look at the picture. I am not sure that the effects of turbulence can be calculated, but how much can we get from the first principles?<p>BTW, Hiroshima was about 15 kt, if I am not mistaken, and the average modern nuke is on the order of 400 kt.",1247327980

This is the place where rich and poor are alike, treated alike, a place in which one can travel from phsycis to china, from cars to conversing about business.<p>Child pornography is abhorrent and despicable, but so is bestiality, some think porn in general is too, some think films with violence should be banned, games with violence, etcetera.<p>When my children will grow to my age perhaps they will never have known of a different internet, yet I will be glad to tell them the tale of a place where no one ruled and everyone was free, free from the knowledge that anyone is watching them, that anyone knows them, that there were any consequences to their actions. I will tell them that in that period, the stale and static internet that they now have, was blossoming, dynamic and advancing at incomprehensible speed. I will tell them that this place was the land of freedom, where man and women where able to escape the propaganda of their countries and find out the truth, where men from tyrannical states were able to get out the news of what is happening inside.<p>I will tell them that this was the land of freedom and like every other freedom land it fell to those who distrust us, to those who believe that we are incompetent, weak, unable to look after ourselves, unable to know what to think, what is right and wrong.<p>When a democratic country opts in to censor this place, it is a sad day for freedom itself. Has Germany forgotten where only 60 years ago their censorship and propaganda took them? Think of the children! -  they cry. And I am, I want my children to have an outlet which is governed by no one, I want my children to have a place where no one knows who they are so that they may feel entirely free to say whatever they wish with no exception whatever, because words are what makes us think and no one has been harmed in the past 20 years from people being able to say whatever they wish.<p>It is abhorrent that a democratic country opts in for censorship and I think that if the time has not come to say enough, the kettle is boiling to the near limit.",1247327314

""At least"" or ""at a minimum"" does not seem to proscribe additional filtering, e.g. of IP addresses as opposed to DNS lookups.<p>Perhaps the use here has a colloquial or legal definition I'm not understanding.  But to me, this language sounds like the proverbial slippery slope.<p>So, will providers work to restrict adherence to the minimum, or will they of themselves or in response to additional pressure go further?  Or will the law go further by expanding the scope of this clause?<p>I have no sympathy for the original crimes involved.  I also have little trust in legislated censorship and in the control and mission of the same remaining undistorted.

699279,comment,699070,699244,0,0,jrockway,,,"You must have really weird software.  OS X, Linux (and BSD), and Windows all suck in different ways.  One way that they all don't suck is out-of-the-box hardware support, all three OSes support most common hardware just fine.  I run Debian Unstable and I don't think I've ever explicitly installed a driver, everything is in the default install.  (I think Intel is mostly to thank for this situation on Linux; Intel has written great wireless and video drivers, so if you have Intel hardware, everything is likely to work really well.)<p>So if hardware is not a problem, it comes down to the software.  Everyone uses the same web browser on all three platforms, so it's not that.  Linux has better terminal editors and support for programming.  (I ditched OS X after never getting emacs to work right.)  Nautilus and Finder are about the same, although I do not like to use a GUI for managing files.  Linux lets me choose, OS X forces its opinion on me.  (I also don't like manually arranging windows; OS X forces me to do that anyway.  It doesn't even have working ""maximize"".)<p>Anyway, I spend maybe an hour every two weeks caring for and feeding Debian, and that means all my software is always up to date.  On my OS X machine, I spend less than that, but every piece of software I have is outdated since it is too annoying to manually update everything.<p>YMMV, but Ubuntu is probably a fine OS for 90% of computer users (especially with OO.org 3).",1247326635
699278,comment,699070,699244,0,0,ljlolel,,,"OS X works only on a limited set of hardware.  I can't install it on any netbook.  I can't even legally run it on any new laptop under $1000.  The vast majority of people who install linux have 0 problems on thousands of different kinds of computers from a decade old to new netbooks to supercomputers.<p>Moreover, OS X also has numerous problems with peripherals.  I bought a camera, standard usb camera sold by the millions, and there are no OS X drivers for it.  I spent hours scouring the web and installing various programs into this location and that location.  Supposedly those drivers support some cameras, maybe even mine.  But no, to this day I cannot use skype video on my Mac Mini. On my Ubuntu partition, it works with 0 configuration. Plug it in and I'm done.<p>Another example: a shared printer.  In Ubuntu jaunty, there's a brilliant dialog that automatically finds and sets up a shared printer with a few clicks.  My friend Jeremy tried to set up the same printer with his Macbook Pro, and he asked me, we poked around, couldn't find it.  We got a cryptic error message that said something about 'could not find bla...'.  We tried for a few hours searching online to no avail.  Today, he goes upstairs to physically plug in the printer directly every time he wants to print.<p>He tells me that for most Mac problems you have to spend a few hours searching online and you might find some blog post where someone mentions a trick.  No, OS X is where Linux was 10 years ago when I was using Debian.  Worse, because Debian always had apt-get, so I had lots of good free software at my fingertips.

699267,comment,698996,699223,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"All of this is great, and very informative, but it will make Mac software developers and critics -- guys like John Gruber -- laugh and laugh.<p>The problem with this analysis is that it embodies the Java Desktop Fallacy -- the idea that the primary problem with getting your application to work on every hardware platform is getting the code to compile and the libraries to load. Sun once thought like this. They built a cross-platform set of libraries and released them to the world. They were dutifully ported to every hardware platform. They still work. But Java desktop applications sank into the swamp and died, because the average Java application didn't act quite like a Mac app, or quite like a Windows app. It looked and acted like a crappy compromise, built by someone who was jack of all trades and master of none.<p>The problem with getting your app to work with or without a multitouch screen, or a built-in accelerometer, or a hardware keyboard, is that <i>an app designed for a multitouch screen is a completely different beast</i>. Making the iPhone's photo album software work on a device without the iPhone screen would require <i>a complete redesign of the app</i> -- you don't have pinch-to-expand, you might not have the same smooth scrolling when the user waves their fingers across the screen. But maybe you can mitigate those missing features by designing some shortcuts for the handy hardware keyboard. But -- oops -- some phones don't have that keyboard, so now you need to design one app for multitouch, one app for single-touch but no keyboard, one app for single-touch with a keyboard...<p>If you have the time and the budget you can just design eight separate apps for eight separate combinations of hardware and sell them all. And if you're lucky, and Android is that good, you might not need eight times as many coders to pull that off. But you might still need 8x the design budget, and/or 8x the QA budget. If you're not careful you'll need 8x the marketing budget. So there's an inevitable pressure to try the typical strategy: design one app, with one name, aimed at the lowest common denominator of hardware. Or design an app that runs great on the hardware used by one-eighth of the market, but looks kind of crappy to the other seven-eighths of the market. And the Windows Mobile folks have seen the result of that approach: At any moment, a team of Apple developers can come along and wipe the floor with your reputation.",1247325776

(And maybe someone can help me figure out why this would get ditched by the moderator.) Keep in mind this was written for NYT audience, not HN audience.<p>The problem with online backup is not the lack of existing services. I've tried a few and they each more or less get the job done, with Dropbox and ZumoDrive being exceptional.<p>The problem is lack of bandwidth in the US. I have a ""high speed"" internet connection and pay for the ""turbo boost"" package. Despite the cute marketing terms and the hefty bill, what it boils down to is grossly asymmetrical bandwidth that's piss-poor on the upstream side. At best, I can push 200MB an hour. At that rate it takes about 500 hours to upload 100GB, which is not even that much data in these days of massive photo files, HD movies, etc. I gave up in frustration and went back to external drives.<p>While other countries, most notably Japan, work to provide fiber connections to the majority of their citizens, we're still partying like it's 1999 here in the US. As a web developer and heavy internet user, I feel strongly that the bandwidth issue is more than just a PITA; it's hurting our economy.<p>Don't think for a second that Google doesn't know how terrible the user experience is with online backup. They've been buying dark fiber on and off for years. But until that fiber gets to the curb, my guess is that they'd rather not deal with the support issues that would arise from a large-scale consumer-focused online storage system.",1247324824

Ubuntu is the best Linux has ever been, but there's no competition in any way with OS X, and I'd probably choose Windows 7 over it if it didn't instantly support all my drivers.<p>This is attracting a lot of downvotes, but I'll restate what I said in more certain phrasing: If your operating system doesn't support my drivers without my having to do work, then you have failed to make your operating system easy to use. Say what you will about Windows, and I'll say a lot, it has never failed to give me audio/video, which Ubuntu has failed to give me every time I've used it.",1247324781

3983,comment,3965,3965,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"I agree with others around here that doing it by yourself is going to limit your scalability.  I'm working with friends right now, but we've done a good job (at least I think we have, we'll see) outlining the expectations and goals of each of us.  So far so good, and things are going well.  I think that if you've got good, open communication in your business you're fine in general.<p>I've had issues in the past with friends and business when communication wasn't explicit.

That is:<p>Purpose of school (to the entrepreneur): Train to MSPW<p>Purpose of startup: MSPW<p>When viewed from that angle, the only thing to fear is that you won't be able to hack it yet.

3980,comment,3809,3809,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"If you really look at those numbers, they become really ""interesting"".<p>The only application making a profit is drop-send. (Sorry, ""top secret"" = ""not enough"" for me) Some of those sites have some outrageous costs indicative of major VC involvement. On the surface, none of them (aside from freshbooks) seem like a very good way to make money either. Granted this is my highly subjective take, but I see it as this:  <p>Drop-Send - Profitable, traded high expectations for more secure results... may have competition problems in the future, which is probably why its for sale. It has a great potential though, and room to move in the cost to profit area to compete.<p>Freshbooks - Good looking app, should be able to pay for itself... ridiculously high monthly costs are a liability.<p>Maya's Mom - Great Idea, better have a killer idea to make money off of it though, I don't think ads will cut it.<p>Mobissimo - Not promising in my mind.. already need to explain in words how they're different from expedia and travelocity. Not a good sign.<p>Wesabe - Interesting concept, but there's no way in hell I'd give them my account information. That's a big leap of faith for a start-up to ask of their customers.",1173815692

We have worked together in the past and things went well but I can definitely see how some of the 'friend problems' in this article would apply to our working arrangement. Is it better to try and go it alone or take the chance and work with a friend as a co-founder?",1173815404

3975,comment,3820,3836,0,0,jullrich1,,,"VCs = Angels = YC = AgentsÂ…They all finance and support young entities for a % of a future asset.<p>Compare a very scalable model, IMG Worldwide.  Take baseball for comparison sake.<p>Talent Scout = PG colleague who reviews applications using performance criteria = bank using advanced credit scoring system to approve or reject loans<p>Reddit = Alfonso Soriano = Successful loan applicant<p>Paul Allen = PG = Drew Rosenhaus<p>YC is popular not because they aren't a VC but because they are a VC who provides more perceived value for what they charge.  That means just like IMG, their model is scalable as long as their value proposition is maintained and continues to be favored.  All YC needs to do to fund 1,000 companies next year is to hire/acquire/develop 50 more PGs with specialties in more focused markets and sub-markets.  Not simple but definitately doable.  Also fully automate the application and evaluation process so that ""people"" only touch the top 3%.  Continue to be careful with funding amounts but generous with time and connections.  Continue to distribute and increase your value through your customers by financing their meeting each other and adding value to each other.  Basically, YC is a social network with most of the value right now distributed offline through their customers.  News@YC will change that to be sure.  I think it's not only possible to grow up real big, but the direction you are already headed.  Just make sure your scalability has a bit of Ben & Jerry's thrown in, they did a great job of keeping their value system in place long after they grew.  PG, you mentioned it's the scaling of the partners responsibilities that is hard.  If the partners maintain the integrity of the barriers to entry (active role in developing and maintaining your application evaluation tool) and support (ensuring key events and high-level connections are solid and cascaded down from their organizations to yours) you can do it.

Next, dispatch an email to all those bloggers informing them that you have created a rival product.

3970,comment,3880,3880,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm curious - why is a pre-launch startup hiring a COO to begin with?  Don't you have to launch in order to have something to operate?<p>(I'm of the opinion that founders should avoid hiring anyone for as long as possible, instead bootstrapping off their own abilities until they gain some traction in the marketplace.  In addition to saving money, this also gives you a better idea of precisely what you *need* so you don't hire for the wrong qualities.  It'd suck to hire a COO with experience scaling Java enterprise apps to 99.9999% uptime, only to find that your actual business model demands a Python consumer webapp with few uptime requirements but massive social scaling challenges.)",1173814329

I recognize the dynamic:  People are arguing with you, so you argue back.  They don't like you behaving X way so they do something not terribly different and just add fuel to the fire.  Given that your complaints that this is off topic is the primary discussion here, this article is probably not of much interest to the crowd here.  Flag it and move on is probably a better policy than arguing at length, thereby creating something akin to ""the Streisand effect"" of drawing additional interest to something you think shouldn't be here at all.<p>I probably shouldn't have replied at all myself.  I'm just kind of pedantic about things like assumptions that an interest in female breasts is merely lurid.  It's not.  Even with a 98% male populace, I have found it perfectly possible as a woman to talk about things like breasts in a perfectly civil, logical, scientific fashion. (And even photos of breasts are also not necessarily about sex per se.) Not all men are pigs who treat women as nothing but sex objects and a majority male population does not automatically  suggest a majority sexist pig population.  Such implied assumptions bug me.<p>I suspect I will seriously regret having replied a second time as well, though my only intent was clarification: That is to say I'm not arguing with you about whether or not this is on topic.  I'm merely being pedantic about an unrelated point, one that I think is a little more important than whether or not some specific article ""belongs"" here.",1311464835
2798181,comment,2797576,2798166,3,0,Cushman,,,"First you should read the Wiki article I linked, since it goes over it much more thoroughly than I can, and then maybe I can help if you still have questions. Here's the introductory paragraph to get you started:<p><i>Where an event occurs in a single placefor example, a car crashall observers will agree that both cars arrived at the point of impact at the same time. But where the events are separated in space, such as one car crash in London and another in New York, the question of whether the events are simultaneous is relative: in some reference frames the two accidents may happen at the same time, in others (in a different state of motion relative to the events) the crash in London may occur first, and in still others the New York crash may occur first.</i><p>I emphasize again that this is the <i>actual</i> way the universe works, not theoretical physics. What you say about our brains holding the two ideas simultaneously in our head is true; our brains are wrong, and the statement ""There once was a giant cloud of water vapor"" is untrue, or rather, undefined.<p>Also: <i>I fail to see how ""right now, over there"" fails to have any meaning when at this very moment that point in space does exist, the assumption is that we are moving between there and here without any lag (instantly) when comparing the sets of areas.</i><p>To move ""instantly"" from one place to another presupposes there is such a thing as ""over there, right now"", which there isn't.

It's not clear to me what you mean by ""now"" and ""away"", since time and distance depend on the frame of reference, and it's not clear to me what it means to be ""at rest"" in an expanding space.  ""At rest"" enters in because we're not going backwards in time, and thus we cannot reach the source of the radiation (the event which generated the radiation at a specific space-time coordinate), but only the event's spatial coordinates, and, absent other specification, those spatial coordinates are ""at rest"" with respect to our own frame of reference.

People who have verbal habits like saying something kind of sarcastically or ironically and conveying by voice tone that they don't really mean it can sound way harsher in a written format than they would in person.  Since in their head they still hear their own joking or warm tone, they may not realize or understand how negatively it comes across to others. Learning to communicate effectively via written word without all kinds of avatars, smileys and other ""color"" is a special challenge.  In many cases, just cluing someone that it sounded really harsh without accusing them of anything can help them start figuring out how to do it better.",1311463761

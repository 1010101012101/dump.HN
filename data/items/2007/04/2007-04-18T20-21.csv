It seems like ""No single-founders allowed"".<p>So the 'we' is wife (advisor)...<p>(Actually, I had an informal advisory group which I dissolved. The 'we' comes from there. As you fellow entrepreneurs will learn, advice is of little use - you want someone to help with the work to be done).",1176929901

It sounds like they need to dig a little deeper.",1176929864

14266,comment,14219,14247,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"They don't need to change it to do stuff that Google Presently can't...I've seen both, and Zenter kicks Google's ass.  They're not even playing in the same ball park.  To be blunt, Google's entry looks like it was built by people who hate presentation software.  I don't blame them for hating presentation software, as I hate it, too...but if you're building it, you kind of have to empathize with your users and their needs and desires.<p>I suspect Google is trying to do the same thing they did with GMail, which was to rethink what people wanted in email and then get to the root of why they wanted it rather than slavishly giving users what they asked for (for example, folders and filters and crap being replaced by search that's fast and works) and the traditional view being replaced by a threaded view...in both cases, it simplified the interface by removing the elements that were there for the convenience of the developer rather than the user.  In the case of presentations, sure PowerPoint is bloated and stupid, but people still want their presentations to look good.<p>Now, of course, it's possible that Zenter will get side-tracked by some of the incredibly clever bits (and there are some scarily clever bits in there) and forget to launch before five other worthy competitors enter the field.  But if they get out there first (Zoho Show doesn't count...it blows), they'll do great.",1176928641
14265,comment,14183,14251,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Do <i>not</i> make the mistake of confusing <i>school</i> with <i>classes</i>.  (Or the <i>education</i> with the <i>degree,</i> another common mistake.)<p>You have more free time now than you probably ever will again.  You have incredible resources all around you -- libraries, books, computers, professors, other students.  The cost of living is low, and you can easily get student loans and grants to cover it, and you have few to no other financial commitments.  As soon as you leave the school bubble, all of that changes.<p><i>Classes</i> are just the excuse to be there, and if you play your cards right they won't take up more than a quarter of your time.<p>

14263,comment,14253,14253,0,0,jkush,,,"One big issue is that the demo I downloaded had some audio pre installed with it. Just a thought, but using audio from a speech given by a man with cerebral palsey is not the best choice for a demo. It was very unclear and hard to see what it was that your software was accomplishing.<p>",1176928096

14261,comment,14253,14253,0,0,veritas,,,"To be brutally honest: color scheme + horizontal scrolling + too much text + general design = I ran off before learning too much about what Juwo does.  <p>Please redesign!<p>Also try to condense what Juwo is trying to do into a short paragraph.  So far, all I can gather by a quick 10 sec browse is that it has something to do with recording/playing back audio, table of contents for audio etc.  Leave the demos, instructions, examples for other pages.  Give me the story in nice big font and tell it to me like ""I'm a 4 yr old.""  Hope that helps :)<p>I'll try to look around a bit more once I'm out of work.",1176927824

14252,comment,14219,14219,0,0,brett,,,"I'm confident they're just fine. For one thing it's a bad sign for Google that they're resorting to announcing vaporware. They didn't need to pre-announce Google Calendars because they knew it was going to kick ass once it hit the market. Strategically coming out with this early means they want to scare people out of the space and they want to put Microsoft on notice. It does not necessarily indicate a killer product.",1176927362

If it were up to them, I'd live 5 minutes away from home for the rest of their lives.<p>School isn't very exciting, honestly.  Most of the stuff they teach you early on is useful, but after that, they just drill down into very specific applications of certain things, in regards to programming and business.  That stuff isn't too relevant to what I'd want to do, I'm finding, and it makes the coursework much less engaging and interesting.",1176927192

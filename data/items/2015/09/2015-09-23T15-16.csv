You can already upload your machine data files to create yield maps in FarmLogs, and this year we released the Flow, a hardware device that passively listens on the CANBus to create yield maps in real time on a FarmLogs account. We will be giving the same treatment to as-applied and as-planted data as well.<p>There are lot of challenges in this area. There are no open data standards and probably most farms in our target market do not have access to that type of equipment. Or if they do, they don&#x27;t have great records of it. For them we offer a sort of progressive enhancement. We&#x27;ve licensed five years worth of satellite imagery to give us reasonable baselines of precision field performance history. And while we also need management decisions for our models, we can make use of manually entered data as well as machine generated precision data.<p>Over the summer, we piloted some products built from these models with great results, and will be announcing them soon. We&#x27;re really excited about it.",1443023997

I never understood the big push towards server-side rendering.  I did server side rendering for 10+ years in JSP land.  I love having a clean separation between client and server, freeing me to experiment with different languages and frameworks on the server side.  Likewise, if I want to experiment with a React component consuming my REST API I can. Not to mention my AWS expenses are kept minimal as most of the processing is offloaded to the client side.<p>> &quot;I like using nearly straight up HTML as my template.&quot;

10265792,comment,10263982,10264171,0,0,l1ambda,,,"The author&#x27;s point was that with Angular, the Angular module system you must use (you can&#x27;t opt out), and you are most likely nowadays going to be using commonJS or AMD anyway, so you end up with two module systems. At the time (in 2009) it probably made sense to come up with an Angular module system, but now that most people use require/webpack/browserify, it has become a hinderance. The reason being you can&#x27;t just require() a module in a unit test, you have to bootstrap the entire Angular system and all angular modules, which is a huge pain for unit testing and causes all sorts of side effects.<p>The other thing the author didn&#x27;t mention is you can&#x27;t debug your HTML templates. With Mithril, you can set a regular javascript breakpoint in your views. Directives and code-in-HTML essentially reimplement a half-assed version of JavaScript. (The same criticism applies to JSTL which throws out a perfectly good language, Java, and forces you to use XML and tag libraries.)<p>HTML logic creates complexity because it invents a new programming language in the HTML.<p>The code-as-HTML is the root problem that causes all the scope issues, all the explosion and complexity of directives, filters, and the inability to set breakpoints in views. With Mithril you don&#x27;t have this whole directive/filters nonsense, you just write functions.<p>I&#x27;ve written more about this subject at: <a href=""https://medium.com/@l1ambda/mithril-vs-angular-vs-react-d0d659c24bae"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@l1ambda/mithril-vs-angular-vs-react-d0d6...</a>",1443023679

None of the criticisms that people try and lay at Vista&#x27;s feat are untrue about Windows 7.<p>Vista largely got criticised for:<p>- Higher memory usage (than XP).<p>- Driver issues (in particular graphics and sound). Because Microsoft made changes to the Windows Driver Model, and big name manufacturers (Nvidia, Creative, et al) weren&#x27;t ready at release, and produced either buggy drivers, or no drivers at all.<p>The reason why Windows 7 was better received is:<p>- It wasn&#x27;t called &quot;Vista.&quot; It was/is fashionable to bash Vista. They could have literally re-released Vista without one change and it still would have been treated better than Vista was (which is essentially the 7 strategy).<p>- Hardware moved forward. Vista and 7 don&#x27;t run well on 1 GB of RAM. By the time 7 shipped most new PCs had 2 GB or more.<p>- Drivers were fixed/improved. When 7 shipped it ran Vista compatible drivers which were time tested by that stage.<p>Ultimately I just roll my eyes at people who continue to be critical of Vista.

Been available for a good while now. Dirty checking does suck though but is usually not a deal breaker.<p>> Problem #3: Dependency injection<p>The authors main problem here seems to be with problems minifying the code. All one needs to do is to pass in an annotations array which is an established best practice. So instead of controller(&#x27;ControllerName&#x27;, function($scope, $someService){}) one should use controller(&#x27;ControllerName&#x27;, [&#x27;$scope&#x27;, &#x27;$someService&#x27;, function($scope, $someService){}]) there are other more readable ways to do this such as $inject but I digress.<p>> Problem #4: Pointless complexity<p>This is debatable and more a matter of opinion. I disagree and think the glut of the authors woes come from not taking the time to understand the framework properly. The learning curve is steep yes but I&#x27;ve used a TON of javascript frameworks and Angular consistently comes out the winner long term in maintainability and stability.<p>> Problem #5: Server-side rendering<p>Isomorphic javascript to the rescue here. React does it better in this case but its available if you need it. Angular is a single page web app. If you knew that going in and have a problem with it now... well lets just say that its important to understand the trade offs that come with any technology one chooses to include in their stack.<p>> Problem #6: Angular 2<p>Yes this was a concern, and then the angular team listened to the outcry from the community and now have been developing a migration path for users of the 1x code. They have also dedicated an entire team to continue development on the 1x codebase for as long as it remains popular thats why there are two angular websites.<p>While I admit that angular isn&#x27;t perfect (literally nothing is) nearly all of the authors criticisms are due to lack of following best practices.

If you loose access to a service for some reason you can loose all your books (and thus all your $ investment). On top of that the prices are too high. Why is an eBook as much as a physical hardback? The hardback costs money to print and ship. Storing and transferring an eBook is a fraction of that cost.<p>Finally eReaders/tablets are still not quite comfortable enough to replace books.

Only 2.5 percent of the French and 4.9 percent of the Swiss population are farmers, said Ziegler.<p>> &quot;You can go to the Dakar market (in Senegal) and find Spanish, French, German and Italian fruit and vegetables at half or one-third of the local prices. The African farmers work 15 hours a day but they cannot compete with subsidies. This is systematically destroying Africa&#x27;s agriculture,&quot; he pointed out.<p>> &quot;Nothing is being done about the dumping policy. The Third World is feeding us (Europeans). That is what is keeping this system in place.&quot;<p>> Ziegler called the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the &quot;mercenary organisation of the financial oligarchies that dominate the world&quot;.<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/poverty-matters/2012/oct/05/jean-ziegler-africa-starve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/poverty-matters/2012/oct/05...</a><p>> Löpfe: Why is it that Africa is the continent where most people starve and which imports more than a quarter of its food supply?<p>> Ziegler: Because the colonial pact is still enforced.<p>> Löpfe: Isn&#x27;t this a bit too simple? Colonialism has been over for more than half a century.<p>> Ziegler: But there still is a small upper class, dependent on rich countries, and extremely corrupt. Again Senegal: The country exports peanuts and at the same time imports three quarters of its food requirements.<p>> Löpfe: Why?<p>Ziegler: Because the colonial pact was never broken. The Senegalese farmers are forced to grow and exports peanuts because the revenue serves to pay for foreign debt. At the same time, Europe sells its food surplus at dumping prices on the African markets. How can a small farmer survive under these conditions?<p>> Löpfe: African farmers are not very productive. Their productivity is less than 10 percent of Europe&#x27;s agriculture. Are they not just lazy?<p>> Ziegler: On the contrary. Nobody works harder than farmers in Africa. They just cannot thrive because they are not supported: no irrigation, no seed, no draft animals, no tractors, no fertilizer, nothing.",1443022577

Additionally finding bugs in the firmware of well-known brands carries a lot more prestige than finding bugs in some &quot;hacker project&quot;.

I&#x27;ve worked with various &quot;build DOM in code&quot; approaches too, ranging from anywhere between Ext.js to HTML string interpolation/concatenation in jQuery and I think a lot of approaches do suck (some more so than others).<p>One major problem with older &quot;build-DOM-in-code&quot; approaches was ability to integrate to third party libraries, but I feel that this problem has been solved by newer frameworks (e.g. via lifecycle methods/mixins in React, `config` in Mithril, etc).<p>Personally, I find that mapping the DOM structure onto Javascript a la Mithril, React, et al works out better than mapping scopes and closures and logic onto HTML (a la Angular), simply because it&#x27;s easier to refactor code that is, well, code, rather than something that tries to emulate having programming-language-like properties in HTML by shipping its own quirky implementation of scopes, expression parsers, compiler, etc.<p>I disagree on cost of migration. It&#x27;s not exactly trivial to migrate from Angular to any framework that I know of, for example, especially once you start using things like form validation flags or filters. The only migrations that sound somewhat straightforward to me are Meteor/Ember (since both use Handlebars flavors) and - perhaps ironically - React/Mithril (assuming JSX/MSX), but for mostly anything, you&#x27;re pretty much stuck with manually porting framework-specific syntax. With that being said, it&#x27;s not necessarily impossible. I know of success stories of people porting non-trivial codebases from Ember to Mithril and even from jQuery spaghetti to Mithril (via its template converter too). At the end of the day, I think it comes down to tooling. With React&#x27;s renderToString or mithril-node-render, it&#x27;s quite feasible to automate a large portion of the work of porting templates away from these newer frameworks, should you need to do so down the road.",1443021134

Traditional templating systems are always limited domain-specific languages that add lots of complexity for things that should be simple, template &quot;partials&quot; and iteration come to mind instantly.<p>Making the virtual DOM tree a first-class value that can be treated as a persistent data structure is a huge win.  Templates are functions that return a virtual DOM node.  Rendering a list is a map from Thing -> virtual DOM node.  Redundant rendering is avoided with memoization.  &quot;Partials&quot; are just functions.  The system handles escaping and prevents XSS vulnerabilities by distinguishing plain strings from DOM nodes, which string-based templating systems do not do.  All of the complexity and difficulty of working with templating systems goes away when we can just use the usual functional combinators we all know and love to compose views.<p>On top of Mithril, I recommend working in a functional reactive library (Kefir, Bacon, Rx, whatever else) to make the whole application declarative and functional.  Angular just doesn&#x27;t compose well with other things like Mithril and other primarily functional libraries do.  I should really write a blog post on this.",1443020967

What I meant to say is that founders take more risk and get more equity than early employees, and that is how it should be.<p>Once a company has enough revenue (or investment money) to hire employees, much of the risk has already been removed. A product is either prototyped and tested or partially built. Discussions with potential customers have already taken place. Initial marketing strategies and plans have been made. And founders often do that without getting paid or even a guarantee that they will ever get paid.<p>They also end up with 10x-20x more equity than an early employee who gets paid a normal salary.<p>So if equity in a company is highly motivating, and you don&#x27;t mind working on an exciting idea knowing that you may never see any money, then founding a company might be a good fit.<p>Or you can make job decisions now that will help you learn to be a founder in the future.<p>Founding a company is a roller coaster of joy and despair, so it&#x27;s not for everyone.

Once you&#x27;re successful, you have the best of all worlds: you can act as if you had no intellectual advantage, and had to get where you are solely through pluck and hard work. Then you can look down your nose at both groups: the intellectual guys with lousy jobs and the dim-witted stuffed shirts. No one will doubt that you are not both smarter than the geeks and better at decision-making than the decision guys, because the fact remains, you beat the odds and created a successful startup, and you&#x27;re still rich.

7991176,comment,7982848,7985420,1,0,dreese,,,"My original point was that ignoring equity when evaluating a job offer isn&#x27;t the best approach.<p>Most job offers don&#x27;t include two options to choose from. Since I did have that choice, I evaluated my options exactly as you mention: whether to (effectively) invest the salary difference in exchange for more equity.<p>In most cases, job offers don&#x27;t include that choice. If that had been my situation too, I would have evaluated whether the salary was worth doing the job. And then evaluated whether the equity was worth the risk of joining an insecure company.<p>But since this isn&#x27;t an absolute rule, I might have tried to negotiate more equity if the salary wasn&#x27;t quite high enough for me to make the jump. Or maybe asked for extra vacation time, or the option to work from home. (I&#x27;ve done all of those.) I know salary and equity cannot be kept totally separate, but I do start there when evaluating how I will respond to a given job offer.",1404540455

First, that it was <i>four</i> planes which were hijacked: For security screeners to allow one armed hijacker onto a plane may be poor luck, but for armed hijackers to get onto four planes looks like carelessness.  (With apologies to Oscar Wilde.)<p>Second, while the prospect of planes crashing into towers had been considered -- and in fact all modern skyscrapers are designed to survive such an impact -- the aftermath of 9/11 was the first time the prospect of aircraft <i>fuel</i> being used to bring down a skyscraper was ever widely contemplated.  If the two planes which hit the WTC hadn&#x27;t been carrying enough fuel to reach LAX, the fires would not have burned for long enough to bring the towers down.",1404540376

Yes, it sucks to have your cat die, it sucks more to have you die wishing you did something more interesting than sit in board meetings and think about gathering mo money most of your waking life. There is a balance and that balance is not as hard as &#x27;getting rich&#x27;; you don&#x27;t need to &#x27;get rich&#x27; to make your life not suck and get your cat treated, drive  a nice car, have a pool you never use, a sauna which has cobwebs etc; that&#x27;s all very doable without getting rich. And your life might not suck very early on that way instead of when you made it. I&#x27;m not sure how old you are but on HN there is a kind of altered reality where people get rich when they are young; this is not normal; most rich people got rich > 50. If you have had &#x27;a sucky life&#x27; because of that till  then you have been very much wasting your life.",1404540185

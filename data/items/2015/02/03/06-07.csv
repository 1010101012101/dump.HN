We can argue about whether that&#x27;s a good thing, but those organizations do seem to weather the change and continue on with their core functions. The State Department is vastly more complex than a tech company yet manages to keep itself in order when one party is swept out and another rolls in.

Things are starting to change; by government standards, at ludicrous speed. The Healthcare.gov crisis really started a useful fire.<p>Todd Park, Mikey Dickerson, and the team he&#x27;s building at USDS and the people he&#x27;s placing into new &quot;digital services&quot; teams at other agencies like the VA-- if you meet them you&#x27;ll quickly find out why they were superstars at their tech companies.<p>One important thing to understand is: yes, things really can be vastly improved IRL, not just in theory. It&#x27;s not that government IT services (&quot;IT&quot;) suck because the people responsible for it don&#x27;t care. They&#x27;re just in a completely different world, expectations and otherwise, and don&#x27;t know how much better it could be.<p>E.g., they don&#x27;t know there exists a hosting option that is more secure, more reliable, and less risky (and costs 90%/$90M less per year). Or that there exist software people who can build a far better user experience (#1: the worst UX is downtime, #2: product lead needs a) exist, and b) fight for the user on every decision), while still meeting all business requirements (for 80%/$20M less per year).<p>Some people do know, but they can&#x27;t do it themselves [0], and they also don&#x27;t have access to the right people to do it for them; their practical options are Lockheed Martin&#x27;s &quot;small-business&quot; subsidiary, or ACRONYM&#x27;s federal IT division.<p>USDS and 18F are fixing this, and much more. They need your help. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s public, but the progress is incredible. It&#x27;s still going to take a long time. Most of all it&#x27;s going to take more software engineers, designers, PMs, etc. The tech gap between Silicon Valley and DC is unbelievable until you&#x27;ve experienced it. Go east! (Or west [1])<p>It&#x27;s definitely frustrating to work for/with the government (not sure how it compares to other institutions that provide many real-world services to a diverse 300+ million population), but if you&#x27;re put in a position where you can actually change things, the impact is enormous. And now you can do that as a software engineer/technologist with no existing clue about government, because USDS/18F has leverage and the ability to place you where you can make that impact. [2]<p>The federal government deeply impacts all of our lives [3] and whether you think it should do more or less, there&#x27;s no reason for what exists to be so incredibly inefficient and customer-unfriendly, especially when there&#x27;s a huge pool of tech people with the skills needed to fix it, and now, a pipeline that can get them (you!) to the right place. Please apply!<p>(There&#x27;s also small teams of engineers [4] on the inside tackling this problem, if you prefer that (less direct, but avoids gov. pay being capped at ~$150k or so and the strict background checks.) Contact me if you want more details.)<p>====<p>[0] They&#x27;re also too busy trying to keep their heads above water in a bureaucratic system that seems to function only because many of the people in it work so hard, but I digress.<p>[1] AFAIK, USDS is based in DC (and I think has positions in Boston), 18F is mostly in SF (Civic Center) and DC, with a few remote people around the US.<p>[2] Imagine if you could direct and organize a team of people to rescue expanded healthcare coverage in the US (oops, Mikey did that already)<p>Imagine if you could help 22 million veterans get the care they deserve on time, instead of hundreds of days late<p>Imagine if you could help &quot;fix&quot; the IRS with auto-prepped tax returns (definitely seems like the hardest one on this list-- but it&#x27;s also one that everyone wants to see happen. And yes it&#x27;s a policy problem, but it&#x27;s also a technical problem-- imagine policymakers having to trust the system that resulted in the original healthcare.gov. And <i>informed</i> engineering opinions have much more weight than you&#x27;d imagine.)<p>[3] Yes I know there&#x27;s a whole world outside of the US, especially on the Internet :)<p>[4] &quot;startups&quot; and &quot;small businesses&quot; both have connotations on HN that I&#x27;m trying to avoid...",1422945554

8989175,comment,8980387,8988580,0,0,kbenson,,,"All I see from that is more evidence for whitenight&#x27;s theory that separating Parrot and Perl 6 was a major contributing factor to the problems.  Instead of one incredibly ambitious project there were two incredibly ambitious projects (possibly half the work of the prior project, but undeniably ambitious) which relied on each other in myriad obvious and hidden ways, in both a technical and social sense.<p>Looking back on it, it seems obvious they were both doomed, as long as they were locked in that spiral of needing the other to advance to be able to move forward, and not being able to really drive the other project themselves.   Think the only way out was to either come together again, not in tighter integration, but as a single project, or to split apart and fulfill their own needs.  I think joining was actually the riskier option, there were many people in Parrot with no interest in Perl 6 beyond it&#x27;s ability to drive Parrot.  whitenight is frank and unapologetic in this, as he well should be.<p>So what if Perl 6 people stalled on giving the okay for Parrot to migrate some implementation details to Parrot?  They were both immature projects, feeling their way through how to proceed.  There are <i>countless</i> possible reasons for that, but a big one might be that they were unsure of the continued viability of that implementation, and didn&#x27;t want to waste weeks of some Parrot dev&#x27;s time to turn around a week after they finished and say &quot;sorry &#x27;bout that, but 6model really isn&#x27;t going to work and we&#x27;re going to scrap it for something else.&quot;<p>Then Perl 6 decides to hedge it&#x27;s bets on Parrot.  Sooner than later, because it was always the idea Perl 6 would run on multiple back-ends.  Parrot as it existed could have survived that, if it hadn&#x27;t already been floundering for a long time.  They had recently decided to refocus on Perl 6, after realizing that the whole &quot;VM for everything dynamic&quot; thing wasn&#x27;t really working, at least not as a main dev goal, and they were desperate for a fix.  So what would that have done?  Make a situation whose viability could best be described as &quot;ridiculously horrible&quot; all better?  The best that could be hoped for there was &quot;still pretty fucking bad.&quot;<p>Whiteknight lays out a pretty compelling case that Parrot was slowly imploding for a very long time.  I trust his assessment, as he&#x27;s one of the few people I recall landing major branches in Parrot, and fairly consistently.  I understand that you put a lot of time into Parrot, and also Perl 6.  <i>Years.</i>  But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that many of Parrot&#x27;s devs decided it wasn&#x27;t worth continuing.  Again, I think whiteknight gives a good explanation; the goals of the project had be mainly met already by outside sources.<p>Was the situation bad?  Undoubtedly, or we wouldn&#x27;t be having this exchange, but I like to think if you asked people involved from both sides candidly whether or not they thought some blame lied with themselves, they would own up to that.<p>> Any post-hoc justification you hear about Rakudo dropping support for Parrot because almost everyone left is silliness.<p>Rakudo hasn&#x27;t dropped support for Parrot.  Nobody has said that it will.  Parrot isn&#x27;t deal<p>> Why work on something when you&#x27;ve been all but told is going to be unused, no matter what you do? Especially when you&#x27;ve been told not to fix the things you wanted to fix.<p>Because, as should be obvious to anyone following along, Parrot usually did what it wanted anyway, as evidenced by the planned major <i>shift</i> towards treating Perl 6 as a first class citizen again.  You can&#x27;t shift <i>back</i> to Perl 6 without having shifted <i>away.</i>  The stories don&#x27;t line up.  You can&#x27;t be a controlling prima donna <i>and</i> be sidelined, because being sidelined means a <i>lack of control.</i><p>You want to know what this looked like from the outside?  Parrot was going downhill for a <i>long</i> time, and when they tried to re-hitch their horse the Perl 6, it was too little too late.<p>You can reply if you like, and I&#x27;ll be happy to discuss this with you more here, in this thread, but I think I&#x27;m done engaging you on this issue here in the future or elsewhere for the foreseeable future (I imagine you&#x27;re fine with that).

8989115,comment,8988819,8988874,0,0,catherinedevlin,,,"I understand your skepticism - I left Federal contracting years ago in disgust at the way things have been working, or not working.<p>But 18F convinced me that they have the key to change that - completely with regard to their own work, and then with a wider ripple effect.  That&#x27;s something I couldn&#x27;t pass up; I turned down a dream job in the private sector for 18F.  Six months later, I&#x27;m more convinced and excited than ever.<p>It&#x27;s important that 18F is a brand-new organization with great autonomy.  This is not an effort to make an existing Federal agency &quot;get&quot; open/agile.  That would be noble but very difficult.  Rather, 18F is built from the ground up entirely of people with real devotion to and real experience in the principles.  That especially includes the people at the top (to the extent we even have a top, it&#x27;s really quite flat in here).  And 18F overall has the leverage to do our work our way, because many other groups within the government believe that we can and will deliver (and are delivering) effectively... there&#x27;s more work lined up for us than we can possibly fulfill (even if you all DO join us).  We can say &quot;no&quot; when we&#x27;re asked to work with conditions that would change us into what we&#x27;re trying to fix.<p>All that said, we <i>are</i> a bunch of idealists, too.  Has our optimism run away with us?  Well, we&#x27;ll certainly deliver excellent product.  Time will tell how far the ripple effect will go.",1422943612

8989097,comment,8988984,8988984,0,0,patio11,,,"I had a Chipotle burrito once on, if I recall correctly, a trip to Denver with the college debate team.  I liked it so much that I put the first $2k of BCC&#x27;s profits (2006 and early 2007) into Chipotle shares.  Then I sat on them.<p>This was pure, unadulterated good luck, but the present value of those shares approaches that of BCC as a freestanding business.<p>Fun story: back in the day, Chipotle had two share classes: CMG.A and CMG.B.  The B shares were what McDonalds had originally gotten, but they could be bought and sold on the open market -- <i>if</i> you knew how to ask your broker for them.  They had no intrinsic reasons to be less valuable than A shares -- they had 5x the voting rights but were otherwise identical.  And they traded at a 10% discount to A shares <i>for over a year</i>, because Chipotle was growing quickly, people were logging into their discount brokerage to buy CMG, and their brokerages were giving them CMG.A.<p>After quite a bit of headscratching about this, I figured out the correct series of incantations to get my discount brokerage to give me the B shares instead.  Two years later, larger investors convinced the board to approve converting B shares into A shares on a 1:1 basis.  Instant 10% ROI kicker if you had been holding them.<p>(In a company which wasn&#x27;t growing like wildfire you would have been able to sell CMG.A and buy CMG.B to arbitrage this price difference away, but apparently demand for shorting CMG.A was so high that doing this in quantity was difficult.)",1422943335

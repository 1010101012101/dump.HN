7688394,comment,7685327,7687786,1,0,agoeldi,,,"Yes. S-Logic is designed to give you a much broader soundstage in a closed headphone. It uses a driver that doesn&#x27;t hit the ear canal directly, but that is slightly angled to use the ear&#x27;s outer rim in order to add some depth. Depending on the headphone model it works very well.<p>Ultrasone sells a lot of different headphones that target different audiences. For instance, the Edition models tend to be very design-oriented and typically get very mixed reviews in terms of sound quality (I can&#x27;t confirm that from my own experience). Others are for the pro market and tend to sound much more balanced.<p>I own the Signature Pro, which has the newer generation S-Logic Plus, and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it. The soundstage is as wide as that of great open-back headphones (e.g. Sennheiser HD650, which I also have), but you get the isolation and bass punch of closed headphones. I retired all my older headphones (HD650, Grado RS1, Shure SE-535) after getting the Signature Pro.

Why are their opinions now less because of their skin color or sexuality?<p>Privilege goes in both directions: It&#x27;s now become standard to diminish any white male&#x27;s opinions on matter of diversity or gender or race, because of their identity, and give explicit power to anyone who is not a white male to criticize that group. Some say it&#x27;s &quot;leveling the playing ground&quot; but it often just turns into a straight-on attack. It is now highly possible for someone in the &quot;most privileged&quot; group to be accused of X -ism and then be publicly attacked by outraged people, often with real job consequences.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m not white, but I don&#x27;t think that should give my argument any more or less power. The post-modernist focus on identity politics and who is making the argument gives another channel for an ad hominem attack merely phrased in other words.<p>Edit: I can&#x27;t reply anymore, but there seems to be a spectrum of offensiveness - and &quot;lighten up&quot; means moving the bar of acceptability in one direction, when people disagree about crass or potentially offensive humor - though of course the bar is different in a professional setting. In general I try to be respectful and conscious of potentially offensive things in a work-place. But among my friends (or among co-workers who have become friends), or at a comedy club, I&#x27;d imagine we develop a different threshold of offensiveness and be more open to crass humor.

Think about mergesort for example, you can sort the left and the right parts of the list at the same time. There is no guarantee that when the program executes concurrent things will actually execute at the same time. Or think of fetching web pages from multiple websites with no need to wait between them.<p>* parallelism -- a property of the execution environment. Based on the specific hardware, and OS facilities, some of the concurrent things can actually happen at the same time. Can fetch the web pages from 100 sites at the same time. Will actually sort both sides of the array on two separate CPU cores. And so on.<p>It is as simple as that.  There is some fuzziness around the two. Like saying can one have parallelism without concurrency. Maybe your compiler noticed how it could transform your for loop into a SIMD operation. Ok, is that concurrency and parallelism or is it just parallelism. I don&#x27;t really bother being that pedantic at that point. Is it concurrency only if user specifically uses provided language concurrency primitives or does &quot;implicit&quot; (let compiler figure it out) concurrency also count kind of stuff.<p>But, wait, that&#x27;s not all. There is another axis of comparison that is useful in practice, and that is CPU vs I/O.<p>* CPU : Mergesort example above would be an example of mostly CPU concurrency and parallelism. You can spawn two threads to make it explicit and if you have more than one core,  you might get some CPU parallelism.<p>* I/O : You an fetch 2 pages at once using a thread per page and your socket layer works properly you might get good parallelism.<p>I/O is where the discussion of the GIL comes in. Python has great I/O parallelism.  GIL doesn&#x27;t really matter much for it. I have written a spyder like I described and it was very performant, very nice, just using plain on GIL-ified threads.<p>Anyway it is important to keep these concepts clear to be aware of them. These are important today and I feel they are not taught well enough in academia (not in this explicit, comparative fashion).",1399066106

For example Scala&#x27;s type system is too expressive to be built on top of .NET&#x27;s generics.<p>First of all, reification only helps in terms of type-safety if you have a weak type system. The only value that reification, as implemented in .NET brings is specialization for value types.<p>Second of all, specialization can be done by the compiler. That&#x27;s how many languages have always done it. Scala for example has a @specialized annotation for specializing type parameters for primitives [1]. And because this functionality has some gotchas, there&#x27;s also an up&coming project plugin that&#x27;s meant to be a replacement in future versions of Scala and that works really well [2]<p>I myself have used the @specialized annotation on many occasions and in general it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. And if that means I can develop in languages like Scala, Clojure and JRuby on top of the JVM, then I really, really love type-erasure. And oh, apparently one barrier for implementing type-classes in F# are the generics in .NET ;-)<p>> <i>It&#x27;s a bit sad how java struggles to become a C# from five years ago</i><p>What I find sad is grown men that can&#x27;t see the forest from the trees.

On the other hand, the JVM is light-years ahead of the CLR, because that&#x27;s what the Sun, now Oracle engineers have been doing with all of their time.<p>> <i>pattern matching, algebraic data types</i><p>See Scala.

Anyhow, per the suit, approximately 31 of 810 -- closer to 1/26 than 1/50 -- of the backers reported that they lived in Washington at the time they chose to back the project.)",1399064453

What matters is individuals. Some gay people don&#x27;t mind jokes about being gay, some do. Some women don&#x27;t mind jokes about gender, some do. If you are a in a professional setting you NEVER lead with a joke about something personal or potentially controversial if you are not among very very good friends. These topics, along with things like religion and politics, should just not be joked about in a professional setting. If I&#x27;m a white male is it ok to joke about my baldness? My religion? My weight? That&#x27;s my point. It doesn&#x27;t matter who you are, you don&#x27;t bring things like that up in a professional setting.",1399064441

Also venus is in a worse gravitational well position than earth so even if you could make gigawatts of power there it would mostly get wasted getting up outside.

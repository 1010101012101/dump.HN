They have a number of benefits over top-down parsers including performance.<p>If you want to understand the magic of YACC, without the whole ""it's magic"" bit, you need to understand how to write shift-reduce parsers.",1344826718

4374404,comment,4373956,4373956,2,0,DigitalSea,,,"Lets be honest here: Facebook makes roughly $0.80 per user per month. App.net most likely will never achieve the dizzying heights of hundreds of million users who are leeching off Twitter and Facebook, but it doesn't need too. As Facebook has proven by their failure of an IPO, their lack of business model has destined them for failure. At least App.net have a business plan right from the beginning, something Twitter and Facebook never had and still to a certain extent still do not have.<p>The issue with a free service is if the free service is good enough like in the case of Twitter and Facebook even if you offer a premium paid service people aren't going to pay because free is better, free almost always wins. The great thing about App.net is that they're openly telling everyone they will be charging right from the beginning, so App.net won't have to compete with their own free offering which puts them in a great place.<p>My understanding is that App.net is incorrectly being touted as a Twitter clone, it's more-so a massive real-time API that is going to give developers amazing infrastructure and functionality to implement into their own ideas. Lets be honest if Facebook or Twitter completely opened up their API for $50 per year without any restrictions and a guarantee you won't be screwed over, a lot of people would buy but the problem is Twitter and Facebook are dependent on advertising revenue they wouldn't offer a fully-open API they couldn't make more than $50 a year off of with ads.<p>I was sceptical at the beginning App.net would be different, but now I am pretty excited at the possibilities of the service. The growth of the funding for this thing is crazy, I doubt App.net will struggle to succeed here. Everyone loves to hate on something instead of coming up with a great idea themselves.<p>Sounds to me like Dan doesn't know what he's on about here. What is he basing all of this assumptions off of? People gladly pay $99 a year for Apple's developer program, I see App.net being the same in that they offer a service that will help people build great apps they can self-monetise much like the Apple developer program only without restriction.",1344826479

When a coder starts talking about how they are using elastic search, AWS or even good old C#, we can talk to them about how the ins and outs and work out how much they actually know.<p>The challenge that we are facing is with the employers.  Many of them that use a HR department rely on a ""tick the boxes"" approach that cuts out many many good coders.  Others rely on ""rockstar <insert brandname>"" company to choose who gets in.  maybe 70%+ of good coders dont make it through because of the above 2 hurdles.<p>Most of our clients spend 6+months trying to get people, until finally they work out that its the internal process that stops them employing, not the perceived ( and IMHO non existent ) skills shortage.",1344826176

This is established medical fact and is taught in all medical schools now.
However I worry that it might make people consider heroin as something that will be okay to have a crack at... There are very real psychosocial dangers of heroin should you end up being dependent and addicted - and the depths of despair that users end up in should not be ignored. No-one can predict ahead of time if you will be okay on it, or if you will follow the stereotypical pattern with which we are familiar with from popular culture.<p>The article also fails to mention that once addicted, and then having returned their lives to some base level where they are able to seek help (assuming they have not died of an overdose), 90% of patients that start on the methadone program are still on it 10 years later- in Australia the methadone program grows at about 4-6% per year, representing new people coming on and no-one really leaving.

It makes it look like you spent a few minutes reading specs on wikipedia and decided that was enough to compare and contrast the hardware. It's not, and that comparison doesn't really add anything to the post.<p>To properly compare the processors you need to note that they are using different instruction sets and that the 360's processors are in-order with hyperthreading. Are the ouya's cpu cores in-order or out of order? do they have hyperthreading? What's the memory latency like? How big are the caches?<p>To properly compare the GPUs you need to understand the major differences in architecture. The 360 didn't have '512MB of memory and 10MB of video memory'; it had 512MB of memory that was shared between CPU and GPU (which means extremely cheap direct access to memory used by the GPU - something with no analog in modern PC architectures) and then 10MB of extremely, extremely high-speed framebuffer EDRAM on the GPU. These two unusual design decisions meant that overdraw was nearly free on the 360 (because the framebuffer memory was so fast) and that you could use the GPU to help out with CPU computations or have the CPU help out with rendering because both could freely access each other's memory. The Ouya could have double the clock speed and memory of the 360 and still fail to run 360 games if it has no equivalent for those features, because if you have a GPU/CPU memory split, you can end up needing two copies (system memory and GPU memory) of data, and it becomes much more difficult to have the GPU and CPU assist each other.<p>Someone who's done development for the 360 with the native dev kit could probably provide more detail here, I've only used the XNA dev tools (so GPU access, but no native CPU access) - IIRC there are some other perks the 360 has like a custom vector instruction set that might also give it an advantage over similarly-clocked competitors.",1344825531

They are often third person, and it gives you a better sense of space on a display so far away. They have become 'slower' and the fighting has become mostly horizontal and far less vertical, because controllers just aren't as good as a mouse in terms of aiming. The games tend to have lots of 'shooting' gallery style situations since it's harder to both move and shoot. The whole chest-high wall thing is another by-product, as is auto-aim.<p>I'm not saying you can't play FPS: you definitely can, but a mouse fits better. I find console FPS / TPS games are easier on PC because the mouse aiming is just so much easier.<p>I can't think of a way of phrasing this in a way that doesn't sound like ""my dad could beat up your dad"", so I'll simply say it and hope for the best: I'd wager than an average FPS player on a mouse + keyboard would be 'better' than a good FPS player using a controller, due simply to mouse superiority.<p>(I haven't played a console FPS in a couple of years though, perhaps things have changed)",1344825417

Plato held that there was an ideal, perfect version of everything in a sort of Idea Heaven, and the goal of the philosopher was to get ever closer to understanding that ideal.<p>Aristotele, on the other hand, thought that Heaven was too remote, and held that we could learn more by measuring what we see in this world. As opposed to the presumably ideal, but unaccessible, concepts in Heaven.<p>The medieval church loved Plato, the scientific revolution loved Aristotele.<p>My point is that the difference between these two frameworks for interpreting the world seems to be fundamental. Fundamental in the sense that the distinction has been with us for at least a couple of milennia, and we are apparently not likely to agree on a single answer anytime soon.",1344823692

If I were to oversimplify similarly, I'd say instead that modern incentives in CS academia, for non-tenured faculty at top research universities, heavily favor money, wherever it comes from (in large part because with budget cuts, professors have no choice). Grants are good, industrial partnerships are good, basically anything that brings in money is good. Citations are secondary, and used mainly as a stepping stone to bring in money. From that perspective, students going to a big company are good, especially a big company like Microsoft, IBM, or Intel that funds research. Students going into academia to write papers that cite the advisor are also good, but not as good as students who go somewhere that has money.",1344823587

This makes the computations much faster since the posterior distributions is a few matrix operations away. This works fine when the model for the plant is linear (since a linear transformation of a gaussian variable is gaussian). In situations where the plant model is not linear estimates can go awry quickly.<p>In the case of particle filters you sample the prior distribution, simulate the non-linear plant with these initial conditions and then construct the posterior distribution by incorporating the measurements. This process is computationally more expensive than classical Kalman filtering but is more accurate for non-linear plants.",1344823381

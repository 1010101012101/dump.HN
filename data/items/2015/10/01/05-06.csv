I hope they don&#x27;t forget to renew it this time...<p>Google.com should be fine until 2020, but I randomly looked up some of their ccTLDs and a lot of them are set to expire in less than a year. Google.co.uk has only four months left.<p>I wonder why large companies with deep pockets don&#x27;t just register all of their domains for the maximum duration. There are a few ccTLDs that only allow 1-2 year renewals, but those are few and far between. Most domains can be renewed for 5-10 years at a time.",1443679178

I haven&#x27;t been as strict as that first year... A couple months ago I spent two months relatively high stress and ate a lot of fast food.. was inching towards 390 again...  The past 2 weeks have been back on track (staying fairly strict in my diet) and back to 370 again.<p>It&#x27;s purely anecdotal, but the fewer grains I eat (I do have some legumes, but try to limit them), the better I do all around.  In general if I stay under an estimated glycemic load of 100/day, I loose weight with not other real changes in terms of calories or exercies.<p>Staying away from soda (Diet Dr Pepper) has been much harder... mostly drink water, but have a soda about every other day.  I try to cook about once a week, usually soup that&#x27;s easy enough to eat during the week and supplement with some meat along with fruit & nuts.  It isn&#x27;t easy, especially the first week... also, it&#x27;s definitely more expensive avoiding heavily processed foods all around.",1443679172

Hellbanning prevents them from doing that, and in the old days it was often discussed with no small amount of sniggering over the idea of some asshole troll trying and trying to piss people off and wondering why it wasn&#x27;t working anymore.<p>A hellban works for those people; it may be the only thing that does. It is an entirely inappropriate tool to use against a user who wants to participate earnestly but is sometimes excessively rude/short-tempered, and my impression is that HN uses it that way often. (Based on the number of times I&#x27;ve seen commenters say &quot;XXXX, you may not realize that you&#x27;re shadowbanned, which is a shame because you&#x27;ve got a good point.&quot; A person who sometimes has good points is someone who should receive informed bans/suspensions, not hellbans.)",1443679164

In Australia our HECs loan system essentially funds research which may benefit society as a whole but hardly benefits students when course content is in some cases years out of date. As it&#x27;s a loan system that graduates don&#x27;t repay until their income reaches a certain threshold (essentially an extra tax), with government approval this has allowed course fees to creep upwards.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with the general comment on inflation. For instance, I&#x27;m not aware of Australia&#x27;s medicare system leading to higher medical treatment costs. If anything it provides a base level of care and limits the amount that any private medical provider could provide.<p>In any case I&#x27;m certain that private insurance companies facilitate the same kind of inflation as they don&#x27;t seem too concerned about the cost of services rendered when they can simply pass that onto their customers as a higher premium (which they in turn benefit from). At least where government spending is concerned, inflation can be managed.",1443679065

I quickly got lost in all the permutations of espresso machines, grinders, roasters, beans, etc. and so I decided I should get myself a baseline of what a &quot;proper&quot; espresso should taste like.  Fortunately, at the place I worked at the time we had a (supposedly) top-of-the-line espresso machine and several resident coffee geeks, including one who was actually from Italy.  I asked their advice and obtained a bag of what were supposedly the best beans in town, and brought them in to the office.<p>To make a long story short, several hours and I don&#x27;t know how many batches of espresso later, none of us had managed to make even a single cup that was remotely close to being drinkable.  So I got a $100 Keurig machine, and never looked back.<p>Still, when I&#x27;m in Italy, I can go to any coffee shop and get an espresso that is absolutely delicious.

I think the types of product we are using for our macros is way off base from even a few decades ago.  I only had a little glimpse of how much so because I know someone very allergic to soy, and it&#x27;s in almost everything these days.<p>I don&#x27;t think that most things in particular are necessarily bad for you, but it might be worth taking a few steps back and switch to less processed foods... I don&#x27;t think organic makes much of a difference for most foods (aside from berries)... But using oils that have to be heavily refined, perfumed and dyed to make them palatable doesn&#x27;t make so much sense.<p>There&#x27;s also recent studies on the affects of artificial sweeteners on digestion, trans fats and a bunch of other stuff.  I think the push towards vegetarianism, low-fat, low-carb, etc as fads combined with industrialization of food has done a lot of harm to the public.<p>If you&#x27;re young and relatively healthy, avoid processed/refined foods as much as possible, eat a variety of things and don&#x27;t consume too many calories on a weekly average, and you should be okay.  I&#x27;m 40, diabetic, insulin resistant, and wish I&#x27;d received that advice when I was younger.<p>I just think it sucks how much it really costs to actually cook for yourself... over the weekend I made 3 different pots of soup to have this week.  I had some chuck roast that I braised in beef broth (store bought), used the roast in a menudo inspired soup (I don&#x27;t like tripe), the braising liquid was combined with mushrooms and onions for another soup... I used the left over carcase from a roasted chicken to make another broth that I then used to make vichyssoise (sub some potato with cauliflower and parsnips). All told it cost about $160 for everything with about a gallon each of three soups... breakdown to 2-cup servings comes out to just under $7 a serving for a low-gl diet with a variety of veggies... That doesn&#x27;t count adding other protein in my diet too.<p>Now make it a family of 4-5 and that budget is too high for families making under 40-60K/year.  It&#x27;s no wonder that boxed mac & cheese, hamburger helper and the like rule the roost at home along with the dollar menu at fast food places.  With all the heavily refined, packaged, canned, frozen and just plain overly processed food that we all consume too much of, is it any wonder why we as a society are experiencing the problems we are?<p>I don&#x27;t know how well supported it would be, but would really love to see food/nutrition/cooking as a core material in elementary schools...  Actually bringing cooking into school lunches with a required prep rotation for all students would go a long way.  It would cost more than those programs do today, but is using subsidy trades to turn chickens into chicken nuggets for school lunches really a good thing?",1443678384

Summary:<p><i>Background</i><p>To determine whether the relationship between caloric intake, macronutrient intake, and physical activity with obesity has changed over time.<p><i>Methods</i><p>Dietary data from 36,377 U.S. adults from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) between 1971 and 2008 was used. Physical activity frequency data was only available in 14,419 adults between 1988 and 2006. Generalised linear models were used to examine if the association between total caloric intake, percent dietary macronutrient intake and physical activity with body mass index (BMI) was different over time.<p><i>Results</i><p>Between 1971 and 2008, BMI, total caloric intake and carbohydrate intake increased 10–14%, and fat and protein intake decreased 5–9%. Between 1988 and 2006, frequency of leisure time physical activity increased 47–120%. However, for a given amount of caloric intake, macronutrient intake or leisure time physical activity, the predicted BMI was up to 2.3 kg/m2 higher in 2006 that in 1988 in the mutually adjusted model (P < 0.05).<p><i>Conclusions</i><p>Factors other than diet and physical activity may be contributing to the increase in BMI over time. Further research is necessary to identify these factors and to determine the mechanisms through which they affect body weight.",1443677361

Everyone agreed, presumably because this deal was beneficial for every party involved, which it most likely is otherwise Spotify wouldn&#x27;t have been able to obtain licenses to almost every artist&#x27;s music.<p>2. There will never be a shortage of art in this world, whether it&#x27;s compensated monetarily or not.

If they stopped being compensated, we&#x27;d just be left with a few million artists of every medium producing art for free because that&#x27;s what most artists do, whether it pays or not. If they weren&#x27;t compensated, there would be less mass-market art, but since the quality of art is both subjective and relative, we&#x27;d probably all be just as satisfied with it.<p>If you stop compensating most professions, their output drops to zero.

There is no user interface and only rudimentary developer tools.<p>3) You can sign up for Tierion in 30 seconds. We have an easy to use API and developer documentation. With Factom, you have to install three command line interface programs, exchange Bitcoin for Factoids, convert Factoids to Entry Credits, and then you can use the command line interface to write data to Factom. It&#x27;s a very complicated experience. They are working on a docker image to make things simpler.<p>Factom has chosen to create a blockchain that is anchored to the bitcoin blockchain. If you choose to use Factom, your application will have a dependency on the Factom blockchain. If it fails, your application will probably fail. They have also chosen to create an altcoin. If you choose to use Factom, you will always need to acquire Factoids to write additional data to a Factom chain.<p>With Tierion, we&#x27;ve created a scalable protocol for recording data in the bitcoin blockchain and generating blockchain receipts.

You can also share them with other applications that can independently verify the receipt.<p>Factom is still in the very early stages of development.

I drank some soda, but also about a quart of milk a day.<p>Now I tend to eat out 9 times a week instead of 2 and I eat a lot more processed food unless I make a concerted effort not to. I avoid soda for the most part, but on the whole there&#x27;s a lot more stuff in my diet that my great-grandparents wouldn&#x27;t have recognized as food. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I drank milk.<p>Surely eating home baked bread or a piece of fruit isn&#x27;t the same as eating a snack bar, eating meat isn&#x27;t the same as drinking muscle milk, and fatty fish doesn&#x27;t equate to pork rinds, etc. Macronutrient ratios just don&#x27;t tell the whole story or even most of it.",1443675992

In fact, even the most egregious patent trolls have not suffered anything like this. The thing that is really clear but missed by most is that <i>this</i> was the one lawsuit where pretty much every nuetral party involved agreed that Google / Motorola was the bad actor, and a penalty was imposed on the <i>badness of the actions</i>, totally unrelated to the quantity of infringement itself.",1443675917

Sure, the stock market may have taken a tumble in the interim and you might say that that means you end up with less in your 401k, which is true, but broad market movements affect startups&#x27; prospects as well, so you are still likely to come out ahead with the safe bigcorp option.",1443675790

8565004,comment,8557958,8560853,0,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>I think itâ€™s also important to establish a culture in which differences are accepted.</i><p>One thing that has solidified for me reading through the post and the comments here, is that we have been focusing on symptoms instead of underlying dynamics. My idea is that the feeling that, &quot;It&#x27;s not safe to be yourself&quot; is not a symptom of racism, but rather that racism is an overt symptom of toxic group dynamics that create the sense, &quot;It&#x27;s not safe to be yourself.&quot;<p>Human beings have finely tuned machinery for negotiating social situations and the &quot;it&#x27;s not safe&quot; sense seems to be one of these mechanisms. Often, there are subtle (and not so subtle) things happening within a group dynamic that signal that it&#x27;s implicitly ok to haze/denigrate/vilify members of outgroups. The original post illustrates some of these. Overt toxic racism is one signal of this. &quot;Ironic jokes&quot; can be another. People volunteering stories of the stupidity of members of opposing political groups can be another. The real pathology is the underlying acceptability and utility of aggrandizing yourself through the stereotypical denigration of others.<p>I don&#x27;t think a focus on matching overt patterns of behavior and verbal utterances really get to the heart of this matter. It&#x27;s really the group dynamic that send the message, &quot;It&#x27;s alright to throw certain <i>kinds</i> of people under the bus.&quot; I think this is very significant. For one thing, it brings to mind the idea that creating this sort of atmosphere is counter productive to preventing it.<p><i>But, putting up with racist and sexist jokes is ridiculous. I think that she would have been happier if she made it clear that she was fun and easy to get along with and willing to do activities like gaming with people and to be social. But, she should draw the line at dealing with some types of behavior.</i><p>No disagreement. However, I think this also gets to heart of the matter. &quot;Political Correctness&quot; that just stops at the mechanical sanctioning after pattern matching certain kinds of speech is no more than an intervention in an extreme case. It&#x27;s like throwing sandbags on top of a broken levy or putting more oil in your engine when the light comes on. There is another underlying dynamic at work. Putting up with racist and sexist jokes is ridiculous. However, so is only treating such symptoms. Both building community through finding ways to bond and becoming more aware as a culture of group dynamics and the psychology of &quot;otherness&quot; is what we need going forward. (In the context of the op&#x27;s described HR intervention, the action was a band-aid that not only ignored a deeper underlying issue, but even put the false remedy on the wrong party.)",1415231756

I&#x27;m a bit surprised that anyone would <i>deny</i> the existence of esotericism for various reasons including defensive.

Or go wade through some late-19th-century occult revivalist texts and tell me those are literal.<p>I also find the assertion that this practice ended rather dubious. Seems to me that quite a bit of our politics is coded-- for example the use of &quot;family values&quot; to refer to the desire to establish a Christian theocracy or increase white fertility by outlawing contraception, or &quot;social justice&quot; as code for wealth redistribution. One of the more obvious ones is how we use &quot;defense&quot; in foreign policy to refer to offense.

Axial engines themselves date back to 1911; Their practical use is limited to torpedoes, where the cylindrical form-factor is an advantage.<p>Axial engines have inherently high reciprocating mass compared to conventional piston engines, which is a catastrophic flaw in a performance engine design. Higher reciprocating mass increases inertia (reducing throttle response) and increases the forces at the end of the stroke (reducing maximum RPM). They offer no meaningful advantages in terms of fuel efficiency, and are likely to be less efficient in many applications due to the difficulty of implementing existing efficiency technologies (VVT&L, valve deactivation etc)<p>Both the current Duke engine and their hypothesised next-generation engine offers poorer specific power than current naturally-aspirated designs. The cylindrical form-factor is more difficult to package than a traditional piston engine; Camshafts offer enormous flexibility in terms of layout, allowing the engine to be squeezed into a multitude of shapes and sizes. Axial engines are inherently balanced, but balance is practically a non-issue in modern engines, even for layouts with very poor inherent balance.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.dukeengines.com/technology/overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dukeengines.com/technology/overview/</a>",1415231397

This database config can be stored as a regular Clojure map in a config namespace in your project or however you wish.

Obviously there is room for improvement here, which will be addressed in the future.<p>2. I&#x27;ve provided a thorough specification for what makes a Clojure map a &quot;query map&quot; in the SPEC file[2].

This raises prices, which means that the BI people are receiving doesn&#x27;t go as far.  This motivates people to get back to work.  Note that it does so <i>before</i> the purchasing power of the BI is <i>negligible</i> - it does so as soon as it falls below &quot;what you can live on with the comfort we want&quot;, which itself will have variation.  I would expect such a dynamic to be self-stabilizing, not self-destructive, though it certainly depends on the constants involved.<p>In reality, some things are purchased from abroad for cheap, some things at a premium over domestic goods, and some things can only be provided domestically.  Your point is most strongly an argument against too high a BI in too small an area.<p>The flip side, 100% participation, doesn&#x27;t seem like something liable to be caused by the basic income, and it if <i>is</i> it should be self limiting for exactly the reason you note - we quickly find ourselves in a situation where the basic income is approximately zero in real terms.<p>As an aside, out of fears over feedback loops I have said before that a BI should not be pegged to actual inflation, but to <i>targeted</i> inflation.

Even for unrelated events which happen in the same point in space (such as the arrival of signals from different sources), we can tell whether they happen at the same time, or else that one happens before the other. This is because we have some clock running: a moving machine, and positions of its hands on its dial are interpreted as &quot;sooner&quot; or &quot;later&quot;.
As to why the clock doesn&#x27;t run backwards, that can easily be explained using classical mechanics.<p>Some time-keeping machines do in fact reverse their motion. For instance an ideal pendulum, which can serve as a clock, traces a path that perfectly reverses itself every period. Looking at just the pendulum, we cannot tell whether the pendulum has reversed direction due to the restoring force, or whether suddenly time has started flowing backwards: the motion is symmetric. This is irrelevant, because we interpret the pendulum&#x27;s motion as a parametric curve. The abstract t parameter of that parametric curve marches forward.",1415230032

For example the author demonstrates a JSON response that is also a valid Windows shell script.<p>(3) By combining these two exploits, the author speculates that you can trick users into executing files that they wouldn&#x27;t execute if they were hosted at g00gl3.com or similar.<p>The last part I&#x27;m not totally convinced of -- are there examples where attackers gain a big advantage by having a downloaded file come from a trusted URL?<p>Even setting that aside the first two parts are pretty neat, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there are other interesting ways to exploit them.",1415229404

This makes DuckieTV the most cross-platform app i&#x27;ve ever built and i&#x27;m pretty proud.<p>I started this project somewhere in february this year as a chrome extension to teach myself AngularJS and I&#x27;ve come a long way:<p>DuckieTV is a web-app built with pure AngularJS that takes care of TV-Show addicts by providing a personalized TV-Show calendar. DuckieTV makes sure the information is always up-to-date and gives you an integrated blocking-resistant torrent search to help you get to the right download as easy as possible.<p>With the integrated DuckieTorrent client you can connect DuckieTV to your local ÂµTorrent/BitTorrent client and be updated on the download progress without switching applications. Experimental ChromeCast integration even provides the possibility to stream videos to your TV while still downloading.<p>More info, screenshots, changelog, and release on github: https://SchizoDuckie.github.io/DuckieTV",1415229243

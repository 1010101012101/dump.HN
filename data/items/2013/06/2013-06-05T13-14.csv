For me, the brain is a huge pattern-matching machine, therefore it needs to have patterns to be able to match anything, that's where the knowledge comes in. In addition, the more ""patterns"" it has, the faster it works. And it can come up with new patterns (and infer their relationships) on its own.<p>I have noticed that many people that are perceived as ""slow"" or ""dumb"" are just unfamiliar with concepts, no matter how trivial they seem. So their brains have to work overtime to try to understand something that is ""intuitive"" for others - probably something everyone struggled with at some point of their lives, perhaps as children.<p>I wish I could have data to back this up, but I only have anecdotal evidence.",1370440470

The method displayed in the article is the assumption that ""of course"" we'll spend and consume endlessly all the junk they're pushing, by definition and without any self control.

Tried facebook for six months OMG what a time sink and minimal/zero return, deleted account.

Clearly I don't have an addictive personality.  As a financially well off adult I most certainly could spend endless hours a day watching TV if I wanted.  I don't need permission from my mom, and I can easily afford it.  I don't because its highly addictive, yet fairly boring, and doesn't have much of a return on investment other than the addiction itself.  The analogy with facebook and other social media as discussed in the article is obvious...  People with a severe addiction problem don't need to read a ""sabbath manifesto"" as the article suggests, or occasionally meditate.  That just leads to a microscopically better read, somewhat better rested, hard core addict.  They need treatment, medication.  Its like telling a heavy heroin addict in a very condescending tone that all they really need to do is read one bible verse a day and it'll fix itself, and once in a while they should wait 15 minutes before getting high, just to appreciate better the feeling of being high or the trip of experiencing something unusual for them aka real life.",1370440238

The latest review of this important report admitted doubt over the validity of linear models at low doses.<p>I'm not certain how relevant this is to the fukushima disaster. Certainly, many people are today living in radiation levels well above those which defined the Chernobyl exclusion zone.

In fact, they may be featured in articles and films, stereotyped for their colorful uniqueness.<p>At 2% and 3% they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs [Europe, Australia, USA and Japan]. Six percent of US prison inmates are Muslim. Like any other minority, they won’t integrate, but work to build their own separate community.<p>From 5% on they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. South Africa's Muslim population is 2%, but they control 35% of the businesses, a large percentage of the banks and have five Cabinet seats while Christians (77% of the population) have none.<p>They will push for the introduction of halaal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature it on their shelves (along with threats for failure to comply).<p>At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves under Sharia; Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islam is not to convert the world, but to establish Sharia law over the entire world.<p>When Muslims reach 10% of the population, they will increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. (Ei: car-burnings in France last October.) Any non-Muslim action that offends Islam will result in uprisings and threats.<p>After reaching 20% expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings and church and synagogue burning (India, Mindanao, Philippines).\nAt 40% you will find widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks and ongoing militia warfare [Indonesia].<p>From 60% you may expect unfettered persecution of non-believers and other religions, sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon and Jizya (infidel tax). (Sudan, Kosovo, Lebanon and Egypt).\nAfter 80% expect State run ethnic cleansing and genocide [Western Papua (New Guinea), Iran, Biafra, Turkey and North Nigeria].<p>100% will usher in the peace of ""Dar-es-Salaam"" - House of Peace - as in Saudi Arabia, Libya and Yemen.<p>Islam is the main religion of the Turkish people, where the CIA World factbook states that 99.8%.

Just talking about TokuMX, I have only seen MongoDB beat us on single-threaded, read-only workloads on extremely small data sets (like under 8K, or one MongoDB B-tree bucket).<p>The statement is really pretty much true.  The best B-tree indexes (InnoDB) beat Fractal Tree indexes a little bit on in-memory reads, but we're not done tuning our implementation.  On out-of-memory reads though, we usually beat B-trees because we compress so much better that we simply need to read less off disk.<p>Benchmarking is a tricky business though.  Workloads can be varied, and you can probably find some corner cases where InnoDB beats TokuDB.  I think we have some outstanding issues where the MySQL optimizer doesn't plan our queries properly, and we're still working on that.  I'm a little out of touch with the MySQL side these days though so that could be wrong.  But algorithmically, there are no cases where a B-tree index has a significant advantage over a Fractal Tree index.<p>Generally though, the read performance advantage we see is that if your indexes are Fractal Tree indexes, you can afford to maintain a richer set of indexes than you could have on InnoDB or MongoDB, and these extra indexes make your queries orders of magnitude faster.  I think this is the most important (non-obvious) point to understand.

The flat rate is the same regardless of a guilty or not guilty plea. It should be immediately obvious that this means it's in a solicitor's best interests for a client to plead guilty, as they'll the same amount of money but for considerably less work.<p>Additionally, the government plans to remove the right to choose your own lawyer when on legal aid, and allow law firms (or, indeed, any company) to 'bid' to provide legal aid services exclusively across a geographic area.<p>What's particularly bad is that these proposals are being brought in as secondary legislation, which means they don't require a debate in parliament.

5825250,comment,5823029,5823213,1,0,geebee,,,"I see a couple of problems with this:<p>First - property taxes, depending on the state, are fairly high.  In my case, this largely offsets the mortgage deduction - though not completely (maybe 75%).  People talk about how the mortgage deduction is welfare for the middle class (and up), but there are also a lot of heavy taxes involved in owning property.<p>Second - there's a difference between getting rid of a bad policy and never implementing it.  If the mortgage deduction were a new proposal, I'd be opposed to it.  Here's the problem - the government decided to ""encourage"" home ownership with a big deduction.  New buyers factored it into what they could afford, and are now heavily dependent on it.  Should the government now say ""oh, on second thought, no, we shouldn't have encouraged you to do this after all, so we'll be pulling that rug out from under you now""?  It would be very destructive.  To me, this is a good illustration of how difficult it can be to remove a bad policy once it becomes very entrenched.<p>Slowly phasing it out could work.  Alternatively, removing the mortgage deduction and property tax at the same time would probably reduce the impact (if taxing discourages ownership, then we'd remove the encouragement and discouragement at the same time).  Problem with this is that property taxes fund local government and the mortgage deduction is a federal deduction.",1370437430

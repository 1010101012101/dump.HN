It seems like dtrace can likely do what I want, but it doesn&#x27;t sound reliable under linux yet.  Does anyone know if the native linux profiling tools can be used to answer questions like &quot;which files is my process accessing&quot;?<p>As far as I found, various tools can trace syscalls and count them, but the critical thing strace adds is that it decodes the pointer parameters to syscalls into strings, something that e.g. &quot;perf trace&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to do.",1370800797

Privacy is a way of restricting the government&#x27;s power over you.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with you. But I&#x27;d also point out that most people <i>do in fact</i> have something to hide. So not only is it wrong on principle for the government to invade your privacy - massive surveillance could end up becoming a real, practical problem for many people. Both are important.",1370800732

5849804,comment,5848113,5849673,2,0,pron,,,"> Multiple academic findings corroborating each other is typically seen as enough evidence upon which to base action.<p>There is little of that in nutritional research.<p>> Also, it would be helpful if you could point out aspects of peoples lives in which they generally behave according to your definition of rationality, or in which they maintain a &#x27;high&#x27; standard of evidence.<p>I&#x27;ll try, but first I&#x27;d like to point out that I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s hardly any important decision people make rationally. I personally believe that people are utterly incapable of rational thought in all but the most emotionally-neutral of situations (and even when they are somehow able to think rationally, they are often unable to follow through with action), but that is a little beside the point.<p>People require an impossibly rigorous proof to sway their political opinions (you can call it the opposite kind of superstition. If healthy food is a new cult, politics is like an old, established religion).<p>Also economics and finance. Economics is also a highly debated field with about as much scientific rigor as nutritional research in its current form, and yet most people are much more careful about changing their spending habits -- or the economic policy they support, which brings us back to politics -- and certainly much less radically than their eating habits. Again, this may be superstition that causes inaction rather than action, but I think it&#x27;s qualitatively different from our food superstition.<p>Raising children, too, I think, is different. I can&#x27;t quite compare it to food (I haven&#x27;t had the time to think it), but while there are many child-rearing fads, they somehow &quot;feel&quot; different from food fads. They feel more like fads, while healthy eating feels more like religion.<p>Sorry for not being very rigorous myself, but I&#x27;m just raising some things we can think about.",1370800646

But the outliers are so bad and corrupt the system so absolutely that no innovation or progress can be had for mankind without an organized system of law.<p>Unfortunately, this comes with a consequent liability for those in charge of the system (&quot;government&quot;) to abuse their power, deeming their short lifetimes and microcosmic plans more important than the needs of the people and the society as a whole.<p>This is the fundamental problem that prevents utopian ideals from being plausible. This is what we need to constantly fight against, because governments are unfortunately a choice of either chaos or control - appropriately defined as &quot;which option is less worse?&quot;<p>This is also why we need checks and balances. We cannot allow agencies like the NSA to conduct surveillance on a wide scale. They use fear and the threat of unknown danger to wield powers we do not know about, let alone elect to them.

If anything, the latter is but an attempt at building a framework toward a saner nutrition.<p>If we were to listen to you, we should wait until everything has been discovered about food and physiology to start making up our minds as to what is good or bad to ingest. At which point I guess what you keep calling &quot;magic&quot; then becomes science. This tendency of wanting to be absolute is a bit naive. No body of knowledge works like that. Just because our understanding of a topic is patchy, doesn&#x27;t exempt some connections to be made that can be built upon to stitch up a gradual and more complete understanding. Which, if I observe how nutrition has evolved, is exactly what&#x27;s happening.<p>Nothing magic there.",1370799856

With dozens of meters, buttons, switches and text boxes, the user has full control of the screen design and how information is displayed, plotted, logged to files, printed and more.  \nWe named it MakerPlot for those Makers desiring to create simple yet powerful data plotting interfaces for their projects and products.\n www.makerplot.com",1370799584

Prior to 2010, there was a 100:1 ratio on the Federal penalties for the two types of the same drug. Crack cocaine also carried a five year mandatory minimum. Officially, this was based on Congress&#x27;s belief that crack was more dangerous than powder. Unofficially, it was because crack was much, much more common among blacks and Hispanics, whereas powder was often consumed by rich white people.<p>In 2010 Obama reduced the disparity to 18:1 and removed the mandatory sentencing on crack.

Sex-drugs-rock n&#x27; roll?)\n3) I met some of the most interesting people I&#x27;ve ever met in my life and that made it all worth while. I did some cool things and in the middle of the financial crisis I was able to make a career change because the Chicago physics Ph.D. superficially let me get my foot in the door.\n4) I went to a NATO physics conference in Turkey, met a non-scientist woman and married her.

Who said it doesn&#x27;t impact the jury&#x27;s decision and the sentence that the judge will give? If the offence is something that should get 10 years in prison, and they ask for life, then maybe this will provoke a sentence of 15 years.

Assuming that nearly everything man-made is a tool (be it a hammer,  religion, politics, the economy or even art), most of the things we make have a purpose. I think the problem is that not everybody gets the purpose of those tools as clearly as others, sometimes to the point where the purpose no longer matters and the tool becomes an end in itself.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that we tend to glorify the tools themselves, despite their potential flaws or inadequacies. We forget that we made those tools to make certain tasks simpler, or more enjoyable, with (hopefully) the ultimate goal of being generally happier. In my opinion, a good example of this is the monetary system, where some people hellbent on making as much money as possible end up living miserable lives.<p>By shifting the emotional attachment from being happy (by yourself and socially) to the thing that helps bring happiness (&quot;diminished substitutes&quot;), we start valuing the tool for its apparent value rather than its intrinsic one.

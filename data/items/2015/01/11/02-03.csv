8868862,comment,8868314,8868442,0,0,vor_,,,"> Look at OS X, why does it use such an ancient version of Bash? Why is apple so afraid of the GPLv3? It&#x27;s not just an oversight. The GPLv3 provides strong patent protection for its users and Apple uses patents as a weapon. An example of this powerful weapon was Apple&#x27;s conspiracy to suppress wages by threatening companies who poached Apple employees with patent suits.<p>The Linux kernel developers also oppose the GPLv3. Are they enemies as well?",1420945139

I the contract could pay people to give it the content of a webpage? I&#x27;m not sure how it would verify it for non https websites, without getting copies from multiple users, which would cause problems if the webpage was not static.<p>Second of all, the memory to store what pages link to what pages would, I think, be expensive for contract storage. Maybe if it used swarm?<p>I guess it would use swarm.<p>Still, the contract would have to have a short running time (in order to be relatively inexpensive). Maybe if instead of the contract producing the results, it would have others create the results, and then verify them in some way, and reward those that created the results?<p>I don&#x27;t know.<p>I don&#x27;t really know my stuff, but it seems to me that implementing a decentralized search engine with Ethereum would be fairly difficult.",1420944596

Pretty much every vegetable, fruit, grain, or pulse - has been selectively developed by humans, many over the course of thousands of years. The bananas we eat can&#x27;t even reproduce without our direct intervention. Animals, too, both livestock and pets - that dachshund wasn&#x27;t running wild in the forest before we tamed it.<p>We&#x27;ve been playing with nature as long as we&#x27;ve been able to do so. Genetic engineering is just a better set of tools for it. Somehow, though, people have convinced themselves that the selective breeding process is safer than direct genetic manipulation. Because, of course, breeding crops based on taste or visual appeal makes for safer and better  development of crops - why pick the specific traits you want when you can just fumble about for generations without a clear idea of what you&#x27;re gonna get?<p>Should we be careful? Sure, in this as in all things we do; but the fact that the technology is new isn&#x27;t the reason why.",1420944588

8868792,comment,8868314,8868314,0,0,kevingoslar,,,"In my humble opinion most of the success of the open source movement comes from the economics of open source software, and not the licensing. Because unlike physical goods, software can be copied, and thereby given away and kept available to myself at the same time. That creates a situation where sharing software is almost always the better opion than not sharing it (cheaper, easier, faster, stronger  etc).<p>If somebody creates a complex non business-critical piece of infrastructure, they have incentive to open source it. Because By doing so they can still use it as before, but get bug fixes and additional features for free from the community.<p>If I create an improvement for that open source code base, I also have an economical incentive to share that improvement back to the maintainers. Because I too can give it away while keeping it. If it gets merged, others maintain it for me, and all future updates to the software already contain my improvement. If I keep that improvement to myself, I have to patch all future versions of the software myself, which becomes harder over time as the software changes. Giving my patches back makes my life easier than not doing it.<p>I&#x27;m not against the idea of GPL, and the good intentions it has. It was necessary and good at the time. Some might still seem it necessary for philosophical or spiritual reasons, and that&#x27;s okay. But most open source software that I&#x27;m aware of today, the majority of the open source revolution that the industry is experiencing right now (except for the honorable Linux) seems to be driven more by the economy of software sharing than the contractual requirement to do so.",1420943143

For one, they provide better throughput -- their overhead is mostly much higher memory usage, and latency (occasional pauses, although &quot;pauseless&quot; collectors -- actually, short pauses of a few milliseconds -- are used in the industry). But their more interesting advantage is in concurrent data structures. Many lock-free data structures (actually, most of the interesting ones) require a GC, or techniques that are less performant, less general, or both, like hazard pointers and user-space RCU.",1420943067

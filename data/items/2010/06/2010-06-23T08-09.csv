Part of that is because it's currently the only high-level language included in Parrot's repository, and what I'm working on is mostly stuff that's in Parrot's repository(an optimization framework/tree traversal/matching language, if you're curious).<p>NQP is pleasant to work in. Perl 6 regexes are wonderful(although I haven't had time to work on writing a language using NQP's support for them yet).<p>Perl 5? I'm finding myself increasingly attracted to it, in part due to being around some very influential Perl 5 people. I haven't been using it much given that most of my coding time is currently devoted to Parrot, and most of the rest is dabbling in C+Lua, but I'm a new developer who's interested, certainly, in joining the Perl community.<p>It seems to my admittedly inexperienced mind like most of Perl 5's flaws are fairly avoidable with the right modules from CPAN (or even just the right modules/pragmas that ship with Perl). Sure, there's a lot of bad Perl 5 code out there, but the only languages for which that isn't true are the languages for which there isn't a lot of code of any kind out there. Perl 5 is not nearly bad enough a language to deserve its reputation. It's not nearly my idea of a perfect language, but it's a language I like and that I can stand to use while I wait for Parrot and Rakudo(assuming no other Perl 6 implementation shows up out of nowhere and somehow gets to performant and spec-complete status quicker than Rakudo) to mature, or for another language I can love to arrive on the scene(a better Common Lisp would be one of these).<p>Tl;dr: to answer your question, I'm a new Perl developer. I'm not really starting any substantial projects in Perl 5 yet(although I am in NQP), but when I have more free time on my hands, I am confident that I will.",1277282487

Talking about averages does not make any sense in case of power law distribution. He is using Gaussian approach which is a wrong model for given phenomena. Bringing skewness/kurtosis/whatever to the table doesn't help a thing since he has completely mis-classified the problem.<p><i>> That said, independent developers making money on that app store directly is a complete crap-shoot.</i><p>Can the same can be said about entrepreneurs in general? What is an 'average' income of an entrepreneur (including failed ones)? Is it worth it? Do you aim for this dismal income when you start a business?<p>Scalable business model is completely different animal from a non-scalable one (i.e. selling your  personal time as a developer, consultant etc.). Quite a few developers expect from iPhone apps the same they are used to in their contracting/salaried careers.",1277281251

They vary a <i>lot</i> from school to school, and I think we're still working out how they should be taught, and where they should go relative to other departments. Some are basically CS programs with a bit of an applied twist, some are basically media-studies programs, some are very art-heavy, some are more like a vocational degree, and many are some mixture of those.<p>Some of the variation is based on institutional politics, I think (probably more than it should be), but some is a fundamental disagreement over what games ""really"" are. The two endpoints of the spectrum of views are: 1) games are a specific type of software, like search engines or word processors or operating systems; or 2) games are a specific type of media, like films or cartoons or novels.<p>Mind sharing where you went? I have some first-hand knowledge of Georgia Tech's and UC Santa Cruz's programs, and am curious how others compare.",1277281064

I've shared tons of links on twitter and essentially nobody says anything in return. But i check bit.ly (by adding a '+' to the url) and see some real use. I feel an obligation to only tweet interesting links for reputation purposes but it does not make me feel gratified.<p>Now consider HN (quality). Far less traffic, but great community interaction with the content. For me, the discource here is more valuable. Heck, down voting my comments is really valuable feedback (notice how on twitter you never get someone replying back to you with ""that tweet sucked"" (exception being, you threaten their reputation). And i'll always leave a comment here versus on the creators website (as i hate comments coming up in google searches for my name). In the end, HN completely alters how i interact with content.<p>HN is only good at distributing certain things and we try to keep it unique here. For content creators, HN can be part of the social strategy but that comes at a cost. Some content creators may not even wish for stories to be here and get sucked into this bubble. For content consumers on HN each comment seems more valuable than a retweet.<p>What i wonder is: Does the quality of the HN community hurt the potential quantity of links spreading virally? Should this change the social media strategy of content originators?<p>{sidenote: Dick Costello should bring down voting and up voting to tweets}",1277280957

They are actively pushing their X10 mini as the smallest high end smart phone on the market and using the smaller screen as a major selling point.  If a huge screen appeals to you get the X10, if a really small phone appeals to you get the X10 mini.<p><i>I would be happy if at some stage, they produced an android phone that focused more on quality and battery life.</i><p>The HTC Legend is probably the phone you are talking about.  High quality metal case, focus on design over specs and the best battery life of the current generation of Android phones.  Hopefully HTC will continue this two pronged approach with the Desire++ being for people who need top specs at any cost and the Legend++ for people who care more about design and battery life, but still want a top quality smart phone.<p>That's the thing about the Android platform.

They are not full of secrets, nor are they going to guarantee you success, but they do sum up a lot of things you need to know to be successful.  Maybe you already know them, and if so, that's great!  You've got a head start.  Not everyone does.<p>I really enjoyed his Art Of The Start talk.  I also found ""Selling the Dream"" among the best marketing books available, along-side Ogilvy on Advertising, ""Focus""/""Marketing Warfare"" (either one will do, as they are effectively the same theme by the same authors), and ""What's the Big Idea?"" by George Lois.  As someone else mentioned, Seth Godin has successfully re-purposed quite a bit of ""Selling the Dream"" into ""Permission Marketing"" (and it wasn't original when Guy was pushing it over ten years ago).  It doesn't mean ""Permission Marketing"" sucks, it just means some things are worth repeating.",1183794935

It reads as if Guy just collected a couple years worth of notes and Powerpoint slides from his inane pep talks and grinded them up into book form. And yet, paradoxically, it is difficult to criticize Guy. The very fact that he has managed to achieve some measure of Internet renown from the warmed-over banalities in ""Art of the Start"" represents a certain type of business success that I can't help but begrudgingly admire. <p>In a strange way Guy reminds me of a fascinating series of articles about Noka Chocolate that I read some time back (<a href=""http://www.dallasfood.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=78)."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dallasfood.org/modules.php?name=News&file=art...</a> While the author of the series clearly demonstrates that Noka chocolate is grossly overpriced and deceptively marketed, I ended up respecting Noka's chutzpah for convincing so many people to pay an exponentially higher price for repackaged Bonnat chocolate. <p>Such is Guy. He repackages the same slogans and epigrams that you can't throw a rock in the business section of any bookstore without hitting, and yet he is perceived as a creative business author. His entrepreneurial resume shows only the Web 0.01 Nutsack that is Truemors, and yet he has convinced a respectable cross-section of our industry that he knows something about building startups. You have to respect that. Guy Kawasaki: the Noka Chocolate of Startup Gurus.\n",1183793213

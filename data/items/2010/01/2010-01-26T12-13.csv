1077558,comment,1076405,1076405,0,0,gjm11,,,"The supposed explanation here is not very good. It amounts to this: ""To get those first digits, you took the actual numbers and scaled them all by powers of 10 to get values between 1 and 10. That's kinda logarithmic, and Benford's law is kinda logarithmic, so it's no surprise that the results end up obeying Benford's law. All you really need, kinda, is for the probability distribution to span several powers of 10."" This is hand-wavy and, not to put too fine a point on it, wrong. For instance, suppose we generate random numbers uniformly distributed between 1 and 1000000; they will not obey Benford's law.<p>The author also claims that looking at the Fourier transform of the probability distribution is key to understanding what's going on. But the full extent of his Fourier-based analysis is this: Consider the probability distribution function for log_10(data). Then Benford's law holds if this is constant (editorial note: it cannot in fact be constant) and holds roughly if it's roughly constant. That happens, kinda, when the probability distribution is very broad (editorial note: no, not really; see the example above). What, you didn't see anything about Fourier transforms there? Well, that's because the Fourier stuff is really almost all window-dressing.<p>For a brief account of Benford's law and related matters written by someone with a better grasp of what's going on, you could turn to <a href=""http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/benfords-law-zipfs-law-and-the-pareto-distribution/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/benfords-law-zipfs-...</a> whose author is one of the best mathematicians currently living and also a very good expositor.",1264509206

Consider that already something like 1/4 to 1/3 of all web users in the US are using a browser that at least partially supports HTML5 or CSS3. Also consider that the more technologically sophisticated the audience of a particular site the more likely they are to use more modern browsers. Given these two simple facts and existing trends in browser marketshare (away from IE, toward FF, Chrome, Safari) I think there is a very real potential for some future major web venture (either de novo or as an evolution of an existing site) to have a strong case for relying on HTML5/CSS3 technologies.<p>Indeed, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see just such a thing happen multiple times within the next year.<p>As well there are many ways, as with html5 video, to take advantage of html5 features without abandoning support for ""legacy browser"" users. Which is the right way to do it just like any major refactoring/redesign effort.<p>Look, take any major modern web site and open it up in a browser from 1997 and it just plain won't work, because modern sites are built using technology that wasn't supported back then. How did we get here from there? It was a long, slow, hard slog that was painful nearly every step of the way. Nevertheless, here we are, in all our modern CSS2(ish), AJAX, HTML4(ish) glory. Where will we be in 5 or 10 years? Certainly in a different world founded on different technologies and standards. How will we get there? It'll be a long, slow, hard slog just like it always is.

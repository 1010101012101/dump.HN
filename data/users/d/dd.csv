ddp,,75,0.0,0,61,"I&#x27;ve been writing software since 1976.  I&#x27;ve been close to fluent in: APL, Basic, Z80/8080, Fortran, Algol-68, PL/1, Pascal, Modula-2, Ada, VAX Lisp, BLISS, MACRO-32, C, and Scheme.  I worked for DEC for eight years on the VMS operating system (TCSEC C2/B1), for TGV and then Cisco, was one of the founders of Network Alchemy, and (nominally) a CTO at Nokia after they bought Network Alchemy.<p>I designed the security auditing subsystem in VMS, was one of the designers of IKE and IPsec, and I designed the IKE over GSSAPI over Kerberos authentication mode that Windows NT uses.  Since 2010, I&#x27;ve been studying Italian and Thai and failing to learn Haskell.  I keep returning to Lisp and Chicken Scheme.  I like Swift, it&#x27;s nicely pragmatic.<p>I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of social media&#x27;s value and I think a lot of Y Combinator startups lack any viable value proposition.  I&#x27;m pretty grumpy about the state of the software industry in general and I am incensed about Silicon Valley&#x27;s cooperation with the NSA since 2001.<p>I believe passionately in privacy and fear my government because my mom grew up in Bavaria during WWII.  She was a translator at Nrnberg after the war and she taught me many things about how good societies can go horribly wrong.",1182186101,1452270433

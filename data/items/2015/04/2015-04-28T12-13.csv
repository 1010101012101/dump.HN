  many expressed their dissatisfaction at the price they

Bethesda doesn&#x27;t deserve the 45% of the sale, specially when they are charging 60$ for the game. IMO, they deserve 0%, for they have created nothing (and were already paid for the game/tools). And mods had value to the game, and increase it&#x27;s lifetime.<p>Two problems with paid mods:<p>1 - most modders are heavy modders (about a hundred mods <i>at a time</i>). Knowing that, I can see some players realizing they will spend more than 100$ in a game.<p>2 - This can becomes Bethesda&#x27;s business model. It can lead to a Elder Scrolls 6 with lackluster content, waiting to be filled with (paid) mods.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with paid mods. I just think Bethesda is getting greedy. Does adobe get a cut from Photoshop plugin sales? Does Unity get a cut from Unity developed games?<p>How to implement paid mods:<p>- Help modders choose a copyright license<p>- Help track/prevent copyright infrigement. Many mods use other mods or are &quot;mod compilations&quot;. And track unauthorized mod uploads to the market.",1430225827

9451793,comment,9451528,9451528,0,0,t4nkd,,,"So, I was personally involved in a HL mod called The Opera, which for some of you who may vaguely remember, is a mod based on the high action shoot &#x27;em up films by John Woo, also known as the Hong Kong Blood Opera genre. The game was the first ever example of animated fabric(trenchcoats) in Half-Life, a tech that carried over to Action Half-Life.<p>At the time it was kind of a big deal, but I also remember another big deal during that time: when Valve bootstrapped Steam and forced everyone to start picking up Counter-Strike updates through the software. Of course, mirrors were provided a few hours after the main release, but, Steam was the first place where the data was available.<p>This was a time when the main features of Steam were &quot;preventing hacking&quot; and providing a better CDN. The little known game Day of Defeat managed to be scooped up by Valve and the community couldn&#x27;t wait to see what happened when Valve and the Steam platform supported a game out of the gate -- Team Fortress 2 looked a lot like Firearms mod with sentries, and the communities were on fire talking about Valve meddling with the mod community.<p>That time, a time I fondly remember growing up during, strikes me as strangely familiar when I look at the conversations around paid mods in Workshop. The funny thing is, though, <i>every</i> game has paid mods now in the form of DLC. The silly hat bullshit in TF2 should never generate real world dollars, this is the virtual equivalent of a mod that your buddy can see you activate. Content like new guns, maps, skins, models, etc used to <i>exclusively</i> come from the community, and infrequently in some &quot;expansion pack&quot; release from the game developers themselves. There&#x27;s a different problem with game development companies and the incestious publisher relationship; but suffice it to say that the primary game publisher, at least (over) a decade ago when I was more involved with the community, was hugely flattered and took joy when their game was modded.<p>Not that running a mod team is easy, it&#x27;s not. I remember distinctly when one of the main map builders for The Opera was hired by Raven. I remember too, when model and skin engineers spent hundreds of dollars on gun rentals and sound equipment to get the &quot;bang&quot; noise for each gun just right. I wish there was a kickass way to pay him on the spot for that kind of investment, but now there are so many &quot;better&quot; ways to run a grassroots development team (crowdfunding not the least among them) and if you <i>actually</i> kick ass and produce high quality game content, you&#x27;ll just get a job in the industry like other people who kick ass at it. Or the community will bootstrap a development shop and you can try your hand at running a team &quot;for real&quot;.<p>Instead of trying to open up a bespoke &quot;skyrim mod&quot; shop and peddle high resolution horse genitals for $3.99/testicle.",1430225254

They&#x27;ve been neglecting to push for the more innovative ideas that they&#x27;re known for and have instead been adding a lot of shady features to Steam and their games that make them the most money. It&#x27;s good to see that Valve still listens to the community, and I hope this is the start of them moving back to being fan-oriented rather than turning into another faceless corporation.<p>Not going to trust Valve as much as I used to until they start being constructive again, of course. It&#x27;s one thing to recognize a bad decision and backtrack on it (something most video game publishers would never do), but it&#x27;s another to not make the bad decisions in the first place. Valve tends to be heavily concerned with testing and user acceptance, and it seems weird that they&#x27;d push a feature like paid mods without going over it with a fine tooth comb first.<p>To me, paid mods seemed like an experiment in self-publication on Steam. Like how Valve used Team Fortress 2 as a testbed for many features that would eventually be used in Dota 2, it seemed like paid mods was a test of something a lot larger, especially considering their stance on the existing Steam Greenlight.

With AAA companies increasingly putting out broken/unfinished games and modders making unofficial patches, it&#x27;s ridiculous to be rewarding the publisher with most of the money and not the modder.<p>I think the biggest problem most people had was that they forecasted Steam&#x27;s mod marketplace as being swamped with garbage mods that offered no real value and were nothing more than a quick cash grab. This would result in the modding community becoming a race to the bottom as modding became less of a hobby of passion, and more of a trash market. Looking at what&#x27;s been greenlit on Steam lately, seeing the garbage that&#x27;s been flooding the mobile phone market these past few years, and witnessing the bullshit DLC is these days, I don&#x27;t think those predictions would be too far off.<p>The low barrier to entry also opened up the opportunity for people to rip existing free mods and sell them on Steam, hoping to cash out before they got pulled.<p>I don&#x27;t think the complaints were at all hollow and plenty of high quality mods exist without paying 45% to the publisher + tip to Valve.",1430224252

Incredible.<p>I&#x27;ve been following the evolution of the situation very closely, as i&#x27;m actually a big believer in paid mods.<p>Valve&#x27;s problem, I believe, was trying to take an existing ecosystem/market that wasn&#x27;t geared towards financial rewards, and tried to force it on it.
Even if 75% would have gone to the mod developers, the community would still resist the change, since that&#x27;s what the human mind is programmed to do, and tight communities like those operate like a hive-mind, causing the outburst to be exponentially stronger.<p>Edit:<p>Forgot to add, all the talk about &quot;open collaboration cannot happen in an ecosystem with financial incentives&quot; - I call BS.<p>Compare this to the world of software development and open source - which is thriving. Mega corps & the little guy/girl building production quality libraries and systems which generate big ass revenue streams.<p>What&#x27;s the difference between a mod&#x27;s code and an [insert your favorite package manager here] package?
Right, there&#x27;s graphic assets, but maybe someone&#x27;s missing a collaborative graphic design market?<p>Game development is heading the same directions as the start-up world - from an industry where only the big boys can play, to a collaborative effort where the execution matters & creativity thrives.",1430223214

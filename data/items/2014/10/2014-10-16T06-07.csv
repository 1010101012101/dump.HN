Much more than other privacy related features. But then!... They flip the OK and Cancel buttons around. Literally, for that one feature, they intentionally go out of their way to mess up the UI to trick people into keeping DNT disabled. Chrome doesn&#x27;t do this for any other critical options.<p>The permissions on Android are further weakened, with apps able to add permissions without any indication via updates. (So long the permission is in the same group.) It&#x27;s well-known that all-or-nothing, say-yes-or-it-dont-work is a busted model -- MS proved that with ActiveX and Vista&#x27;s plethora of UAC prompts. So it&#x27;s very unlikely that Android&#x27;s permission model and UI is accidental.<p>And even then, consider the rampant abuse in the Google Play store.

8463683,comment,8462179,8463486,0,0,vidarh,,,"If you think that, then you can&#x27;t have <i>read</i> much communist literature.<p>Marx spent large parts of his life criticising the idea that this was easy, and criticising the idea of the &quot;inherent goodness of human nature&quot;.<p>On the contrary, Marxism assumes that it is human nature to first of all satisfy our own basic needs. In the German Ideology, Marx made the point that if a socialist revolution were to happen in an under-developed economy (like say Russia, or China, or Cuba, or North Korea, or Vietnam at the times of their respective &quot;revolutions&quot;), then redistribution would only make  <i>want</i> common, and the same class struggles would reassert themselves. It was Lenin who laid the groundwork for ignoring that central part of Marx&#x27; of theses - a part he kept repeating in various contexts throughout his life.<p>Because a vital part of Marxism is the idea that society moves through phases that are dictated by social and economic conditions for production, and which &quot;traps&quot; us all. Marx did not see the capitalist as evil, nor did he see the workers as good - he saw everyone as effectively being forced into roles they either lived up to or lost. E.g. a capitalist that failed to act like a capitalist would go bankrupt and enter the working classes.<p>It was not &quot;inherent goodness&quot; Marx expected to bring a socialist revolution, but the working classes rising up in anger as capitalisms focus on increased productivity eventually reaches a point where the way of further increasing productivity makes capitalism itself fail as it runs out of fresh markets to expand into, and turns inwards on itself, with wages and jobs eventually being the only thing to cut. Couple this with the expectation that the ruling classes will refuse to yield to popular demand, but instead will use the means of oppression available to them.<p>The only reason a socialist revolution is considered <i>necessary</i> by Marxists is the assumptions that humans are not &quot;inherently good&quot;, or at least not &quot;good enough&quot;. But nor are they evil: It is natural to want to keep what you have, and so natural for the ruling classes to resist.<p>> Produce as much as you can, take as much as you need, what could possibly go wrong?
> 
> (Spoiler alert: pretty much everything)<p>Of course no system has ever <i>attempted</i> that kind of distribution, and Marx explicitly warned (e.g. in Critique of the Gotha Program) that this was a long range goal for an advanced, well developed communist society, and that in the intermediate stages leading up to a socialist revolution, and during socialism, he saw it as more realistic to aim for a gradual transformation of the modes of production and to gradually redistribute through changes to taxation and salaries and welfare systems - not some &quot;free for all&quot; overthrow of all existing structure. In fact this is a defining difference between Marxism and the various anarchist ideologies (which tends to advocate the immediate destruction of the state to various degrees)<p>Even Leninist and subsequent bastardisations of Marxism kept to this - in large part I suspect because it became a convenient excuse for the various party elites to keep the masses in check while they lived in luxury.",1413441789

Back then, it was all about enablement. Getting people just onto the web in the first place was hard. They had to buy a computer, a modem, sign up with an ISP, possibly upgrade their operating system, install a web browser etc. But in those days, installing a web browser meant you had to go buy a Magazine from a shop just to get the CD-ROM. Microsoft viewed this, rightly, as an impediment. So they bundled IE with their OS. A practice that is still common place today by every major operating system that exists including Windows, Linux, OSX, Android, iOS, WinPhone.<p>Without IE bringing DHTML we would not have the foundations that made modern day JavaScript, SPA, &quot;Ajax&quot; applications today. How is that not fostering innovation? IE 1 to 6 were a technology showcase to show everybody else what the web _could_ be or become.

The file-loss bug in the FS? And tons of other things besides.<p>As for hardware, well, Jobs first love child was the cube, with the overheating problem (and the not-selling-well problem). Then we had the iBook G3 logic board issues (for tons of models). Battery issues. The G5 Pro cooling goo leak issue. Etc etc. And of course, as any long time Mac buyer knows, a classic advice is &quot;never buy the first revision of a product&quot;.<p>Part of it, for hardware, is that a bug in a production run e.g. for Dell doesn&#x27;t affect that many people (because Dell puts out 50+ different models, whereas Apple puts out a few, so each of Apple&#x27;s has tens of millions of buyers). And of course the press doesn&#x27;t care much for a fault in Dell or HP or whatever production run, whereas the slightest BS in an Apple production run is a &quot;*gate&quot;.

People still claim Apple made the end-all solution when with the retina displays &quot;you couldn&#x27;t see the pixels&quot;. As it turns out, not being able to make out individual pixels does not mean higher PPI stops adding value. Returns are diminishing, sure, but I sure as hell prefer my text rendered on 500ppi devices compared to 300ppi devices.<p>I agree with you if the comparison is between 500ppi and 300ppi, but anything higher than 400ppi seems like a waste.  I could easily distinguish pixels at 300ppi if I looked close enough, but I cannot distinguish individual pixels on an iPhone 6+ screen no matter how hard I try.",1413439601

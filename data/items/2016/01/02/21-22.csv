If not, why?<p>To address your concerns generally -- every tax policy has a variety of impacts on behavior. Multiple countries already have a wealth tax, so they are definitely workable. There are behavioral and policy methods of addressing potential negative consequences.<p>To respond more specifically:<p>> <i>What if I own a house but have no cash? Will I have to sell it and live on the street to pay the taxman?</i><p>That&#x27;s a straw man argument for a host of reasons. We already carve out exemptions for primary dwellings, and there&#x27;s no reason why this wouldn&#x27;t similarly apply, up to some limit. But even absent that, real assets are real assets, and there are multiple ways of extracting liquidity from them (and moreover doing so generates wealth for society).  You can take on a &quot;reverse mortgage&quot;, or rent out one of your rooms, or sell it and rent, or take out an annuity that&#x27;s secured against your home, among other possibilities.<p>> <i>What if the ultra-wealthy buy property and then mark it down? I.e. they buy paintings, then &quot;accidentally&quot; &quot;damage&quot; them. Whoops, a billion dollars in artwork gone, sorry IRS. Later, it is miraculously repaired. Will the IRS have to start sending undercover agents to inspect people&#x27;s art collections?</i><p>That&#x27;s fraud/non-compliance/tax evasion, and it&#x27;s already a massive problem in the current tax system, except now it&#x27;s cloaked in things like a &quot;double dutch with an irish sandwich&quot;. In any case, this is a problem that is dealt with every day, in business, by insurance companies, and there&#x27;s no reason why the same techniques couldn&#x27;t be used by tax officials.<p>> <i>A 3% wealth tax is still less than the growth rate of many financial assets. I.e. the stock market grows at ~7%. So the rich will still get richer. And if you increase the tax to say, 8%, congrats, you just destroyed the financial markets.</i><p>Yes, and a 95% income tax rate will destroy the labor market. So? And yes, at 7% CAGR on the S+P the wealthy continue to get wealthier (assuming all their assets are in equities, a big assumption). But note that, in the process, we&#x27;ve eliminated income taxes, so everyone else will be getting richer <i>faster</i>. A win-win.",1451771991

Imagine if you invest in a company like Apple. Apple developed products like the iPod and iPhone, and the company&#x27;s value comes from the fact that 500 million people gave their money to Apple in exchange for an iPhone. Apple&#x27;s $233 billion dollar revenue, and resulting net income, leads to their valuation, which leads to the return on our hypothetical investment.<p>The investment profits because Apple developed a useful product that people chose to spend money on - the people who bought the products benefited, and the investor benefited from a return. Everyone is better off, and the standard of living has risen. Technology makes things cheaper over time, so that more people can afford such devices. A vast majority of people living in poverty in America own cell phones.<p>Can you describe how these investment vehicles work such that they&#x27;re earning a return while being disconnected from the real world? Where does the money come from for the returns?",1451771898

If we assume docker is the preferred way to deploy an app. We only need very limited features from kernel:<p>- If I specify the CPU and RAM requirements, the kernel simply allocates them to the container. There is no need for complicated dynamic scheduling and balance.<p>- Network within the same data center has much lower latency than hard disk (<<1ms vs 10ms). We will be much better of using network storage or database.<p>- If we assign network address to each container, the kernel can deliver network packets to container, and the container uses its own CPU and RAM to process the network traffic. This will avoid the situation that kernel spend a lot of CPU/RAM to process network traffic for all containers and find the correct way to charge the cost.<p>If we do all above, there is not much kernel features are needed by cloud applications, as such features will be replaced by cloud services like cloud storage/database.

Would personal computing devices have become popular in a highly fragmented world? According to Wikipedia, the Apple II cost over $5k, accounting for inflation. Absent a healthy middle class, which was created by the era of conformity and relative income equality, would there have been enough consumers to create a market for a $5k computer? As we see income inequality rise, are we not also going to see the opportunity for wealth creation diminish as capital congregates in the hands of a class that largely conserves it?<p>I think we&#x27;re already seeing this. As an exercise, try to think of something non-niche that costs around $5k, the price of the Apple II, for which there isn&#x27;t some form of financing (auto/home/college loans and such). I&#x27;m hard-pressed to think of something and I believe it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s an increasingly small number of people that can afford such a product. We&#x27;re already losing the conditions that allowed Apple to introduce the personal computer.

Most well designed libraries avoid it if they can, but sometimes the object is simply too large for the stack. For many library types its a undocumented implementation detail we dont know about.<p>We as users of that library type should not additionally put that object on the heap though, if we dont have too. Its simply unnecessary.<p>Its makes for one extra unnecessary pointer indirection, it adds unnecessary reference counting if using smart pointers, or unnecessary manual memory management if we use raw pointers. It complicates the interface for our functions if we have to wrap types in smart pointers.<p>As for c++ references. Yes that&#x27;s true. As I understand it they are implemented as pointers internally by compilers. But in important ways they behave more like values, rather than pointers. As in if you copy or assign to them, they copy or assign the value (not the pointer). If you take their address they give the address of the value (not the pointer). Because of this there are not as many pitfalls to using them as there is with pointers. I see them mostly just as aliases for values.<p>In the example above I could have passed the string by value (instead of by reference) to the function. It would  still not have done a expensive copy, because of copy elision optimisation. I probably should have done that.

10828094,comment,10826838,10827534,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> or at least Larry Page selling his company to other private owners, once his shares are worth $500M<p>I would argue definitely public. Google market cap is over $500B. Anyone else who owns $500M would have the same incentive, so you would have <i>at least</i> 1000 owners, and almost certainly far more than that because the owners would want to diversify instead of investing their entire $500M into a company they don&#x27;t even close to control.<p>> I also think that there&#x27;s no guarantee that Page or Ford will, in fact, decide to prioritize something other than shareholder value.<p>There is no guarantee, but if it is to happen at all then that is currently the only way it <i>can</i>.<p>> An alternative approach would be, once the CEO&#x27;s shares are worth $500M, they should start to increase salaries or issue shares to their employees or donate to charity or something, such that their personal ownership interest remains valued at $500M but they retain creative control (which they wouldn&#x27;t if they let it go public).<p>Part of the problem is that because of the way taxes currently work, it&#x27;s &quot;better&quot; (people pay less taxes) if the company&#x27;s stock price goes up than if the company pays a dividend, so they tend to structure things to make that happen. So Page doesn&#x27;t get proportionately that much &quot;income&quot; from Google in the sense of cash money (unless he sells his shares), but his net worth doubles with the share value. So if you want to keep the original owners in control of the company, but you want the company to be able to grow, then so must their wealth.<p>You could try to separate control from ownership, but who is going to invest in a company controlled by someone with no obligation to even try to grow the investment? If you want to help the world by donating your money to Elon Musk then you can already do that today.<p>> An alternative approach would be, once the CEO&#x27;s shares are worth $500M, they should start to increase salaries or issue shares to their employees or donate to charity or something, such that their personal ownership interest remains valued at $500M but they retain creative control (which they wouldn&#x27;t if they let it go public).<p>The problem is their wealth is derived from the value of the company. Larry Page doesn&#x27;t have X billion dollars <i>in cash</i>, he has shares of a corporation with that market value. He (personally) could only donate it to a charity or give it to employees by liquidating the shares and divesting the ownership stake in the company.<p><i>The company</i> could do those things to an extent, but if you&#x27;re talking about a law to require that then it no longer has any real relationship to concentration of wealth or who owns the company. And you&#x27;ll end up with all the same trouble with trying to measure the domestic profit of an international corporation that we have with corporate income tax.<p>> What if we rework the assumption that a publicly-traded company needs to maximize shareholder value at the expense of employee welfare?<p>The <i>idea</i> of a publicly traded company is premised on &quot;maximizing shareholder value&quot; because making money is the shared interest that binds the shareholders together. If you take that away then who gets to decide where the profits actually go? And who is going to invest in such a company if an undetermined party who isn&#x27;t them gets to decide what happens to their profits?<p>> What if there was a rule that, say, any publicly-traded company needs to at least start with majority employee ownership?<p>&quot;Start with&quot; means nothing if it will change in fifteen minutes. Most companies <i>do</i> start with majority employee ownership. But if employees can&#x27;t sell their shares then do they really own them? You could try something like giving the employees a vote (without an ownership stake) in electing corporate officers, but the result is going to be predictable. They&#x27;ll elect people who pay the employees unsustainably high wages and the company will soon go out of business.<p>I can tell you how to fix a lot of this. The tax code currently makes it highly desirable for corporations to never repatriate their overseas earnings, because if they do they have to pay a very high corporate income tax on it. Which means they don&#x27;t ever issue those earnings as dividends, instead they accumulate huge piles of cash. The shareholders don&#x27;t mind that much (not as much as they mind paying high taxes) because holding cash raises the share price and shareholders who want cash can then have it by selling shares. But it means the only way to take profit is to sell shares, which for a controlling shareholder means ultimately giving up the controlling interest in the company.<p>People always talk about the cash hoarding problem, because it is an enormous problem, but the solution people suggest is a farce. People say to have a tax holiday to let the money come back into the US. And once in a while they do it... and no one takes advantage of it. Because not only was there a tax on repatriating the money, once it&#x27;s in the US, all the <i>future interest</i> on the money will be taxed, whereas it isn&#x27;t when the money is offshore in some tax haven.<p>The problem is, the only way to actually fix it is to not tax income. In theory it would be solved by only not taxing investment income, but that would be entirely unfair to people who are still paying income tax on earned income. What needs to be done is stop taxing income entirely and tax consumption instead. Scream about regressive taxes all you like; how progressive is it today when middle class people are paying 25% and investors and corporations are paying nothing?<p>With no income tax there is no reason not to bring the money back into the country, which puts it in the hands of human owners rather than huge corporations, without forcing them to sell shares that removes their controlling interest in their companies. At that point essentially all their reasonable choices for what to do with the money are good for society: They can spend it (and pay the consumption tax), or they can give it to charity, or they can invest it and grow the economy and generate tax revenue when the invested-in company spends it and pays consumption tax. Instead of having it sit in some offshore money market account managed by some corporate executive whose money it isn&#x27;t, where it helps no one and no tax is ever paid.",1451771006

Technology development usually brings prices down. This is deflationary; the &#x27;big picture&#x27; way that deflation happens: that prices are discovered more efficiently, or resources are used more efficiently, or that idle labor capacity is recruited to fulfill a want or need that was not known before (esp: think uber/lyft).<p>>Deflationary processes are inherently anti-inequality. Think of it this way. If we never changed the minimum wage, then people&#x27;s incomes, especially at the bottom segment of society would make their net economic potential greater over time.<p>>It is not the investment in technology that makes &quot;tech drive inequality&quot;. It is the political structure around it. We have a structure where monetary policy shoves free or cheap money into the faces of banks and the investment classes in efforts to &#x27;stimulate&#x27; the economy, where the secular (over decades, not over years) inflation drives low- and middle- class citizens into risky investment activity just to be able to sustain themselves in their later years (effectively a subsidy for the rich).<p>&quot;families often consist of two breadwinners (& no children) with a hearty amount of debt, nothing owned, and few savings. The family unit itself may even be weaker because of less shared ownership. Wages haven’t tracked productivity for decades, so wages haven’t risen since the previous story was normal.&quot;<p>Is this because of rapacious capitalists taking wages?  The nominal wage has increased since the early 70s, but the purchasing power of that nominal wage has gone down faster than the increase.

There is a cost to getting people employed, and that is that those who are employed are going to be paid less, and the way you trick people into that is by making what people earn be less, even for the same or greater nominal amount (&quot;sticky wages argument&quot;).<p>What happened in the early 70s?  Prior to the nixon shock we had wage increases leading inflation and a trending toward decreasing of the wage gap that had momentum enough to continue till about the 2000s (if you think about it that momentum makes sense because entrants into the workforce in the 70s started retiring in the 200s) - during the bush/obama era we see income inequality turning the corner.<p>While we are certainly trending towards getting worse things actually are not that bad:<p><a href=""http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/d823a614-9e82-11e5-b45d-4812f209f861.img"" rel=""nofollow"">http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/d823a614-9e82-11e5-b4...</a><p>Everyone is worried about the far right side of the graph (which is partially a histogram artifact) but look at the left hand side of the graph and see how the lowest income fraction of society is far less populated than 40 years ago.

No, they invest it. That investment money flows to other corporations who then spend it on goods and services, or spend it on their employees.

Perhaps growing economic inequality is a natural consequence of capitalism itself, and the &quot;defragmentation&quot; (or greater economic socialization) of the economy brought about by World War II was only a temporary reprieve from the overall trend toward greater inequality.<p>This view is essentially Marx&#x27;s original critique that, given enough time, capitalism will destroy itself. As wealth accumulates at the upper end of the income spectrum, it has a self-reinforcing and accelerating feedback effect: greater wealth purchases greater political and social influence, which enables even greater wealth production, often at the expense of the poor and the less wealthy. The system inevitably sows the seeds of its own destruction.<p>History has shown that massive inequalities lead to instability and revolution. As a self-admitted beneficiary and generator of said inequality, Graham is right to be worried about how he would do during such a period of instability.",1451769526

It&#x27;s not just creating chairs, it&#x27;s aggregating great wealth by &#x27;disrupting&#x27; traditional industries.  Those traditional industries have workers and shareholders who lose out.<p>What makes successful startups so profitable is they displace a large and less-efficient system with a small, efficient one.  Efficient in terms of human capital, oftentimes: look how few people AirBNB employs directly, yet have a market cap larger than Marriott.  The returns on capital its investors have seen is a result of the substitution of capital for labor (in part).<p>Of course, to the extent that the creation of a marketplace unlocks value, it can create value de novo, rather than shifting wealth from one sector/company to another.  But with &#x27;smart&#x27; startup founders seeking monopoly rents (cf. Peter Thiel, writing/speaking virtually anywhere), those returns are also concentrated, and will not trickle down to the larger population.<p>Furthermore, the wealth inequality cryoshon is writing about is not driven by startups, it&#x27;s driven by a general breakdown in the implicit social contract between capital and labor.  As OP notes, Piketty goes into great detail about the historical causes and likely effects, but the tl;dr (and his book is _very_ tl) break down to: when returns on capital are higher than overall economic growth, wealth will tend to aggregate.<p>As fans of numbers and algorithms, I hope HN readers can appreciate the simple beauty of that formulation.  Piketty&#x27;s suggested policy response is simple: high taxes on aggregated wealth.  Which, after reading (~80%, honestly) of his book, I have to agree with.",1451768704

Technology is the big energy input needed to break free and move to a new maximum.<p>When I use Uber, I get much more value than I ever did with a taxi. Not only does it cost me less, but it&#x27;s faster, the experience of ordering is painless, the cars are nicer, the drivers are honest, and there&#x27;s accountability for bad drivers.  Uber is most definitely creating value.<p>More generally, new ways of doing things displace old ways of doing things.  If you&#x27;re a company doing things the old way, adapt or die.  That&#x27;s progress.  In capitalism, the destruction of old business models is as essential as the construction of new ones.  They are two sides of the same coin.<p>Addressing your argument again, lots of the businesses being displaced were basically profiting from regulations that kept out competition.  He who lives by the sword dies by the sword.<p>As for your general point that the valley isn&#x27;t really creating much value, remember that all of those wild valuations are just risky speculation by a small few, given that there&#x27;s no open market for buying and selling shares in these companies. Risky speculation is a valid investment strategy for a portion of your wealth. Beyond all of the hard-to-believe valuations, there&#x27;s also thousands of small technology companies making small profits and providing real value, but not getting any media attention.",1451768478

I don't know if it's totally there yet, but I'm loving it thus far.<p>One thought: as a parent, I'd be <i>very</i> interested in seeing your privacy polic(ies) spelled out in detail. I would freak out, hunt you down and drink your blood if I found out you were tracking my kids' web history, logging unencrypted form submissions containing names, etc., etc.

Even then, after 13+ years of post-secondary education and slave-wage ""training,"" you might very well find yourself un- or under-employed by age 40, because you're considered too expensive or (ironically) too specialized.<p>There are so many new bio PhDs minted every year that the labor supply is <i>far</i> out-pacing demand.  Right now, the big names (I'm lookin' at you, Genentech...) are hiring extremely talented people into glorified lab-tech positions.<p>In short, biotech is no panacea.",1191474797

You wouldn't believe how much money the ancient software being used cost the company, but no one would spend money to upgrade the software because maintenance only cost the company money.<p>A rarely mentioned difference between the legacy airlines and profitable ones like Southwest is that Southwest is not running operations and maintenance on 70s era mainframe software.",1191474461

If you are tech person, work on a pure technology company, where the product you are making is the money maker.  You will be treated much better, as the company will try to maximize your productiviy.<p>If you are a tech guy, working, let's say in a finance company, where technology is considered as an ""expense"", then you will never be treat as well, b/c you are less worth to the company, and they will always try to minimise your expense.",1191474180

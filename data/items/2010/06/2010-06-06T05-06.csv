I've been doing research since my first year as an undergrad (mainly through Canadian research grants, which offer paid summer internships). We do mainly C++, Java, VHDL, Verilog, assembly, but there's fairly little actual language education - they teach the semantics, we learn the syntax by reading and trying stuff.<p>On the more CS side of things, we did state machines, graph theory, recursion, formal proofs, and a good dose of math: solving differential equations analitically and numerically, calculus applied to force fields, Laplace, Fourier, complex analysis etc. Of course there's also electronic circuits, networking, computer architecture, (object-oriented) architecture... It's possible to study more web-related things such as databases, but I'm in embedded systems so we don't really touch this.<p>It's as applied as you can get: I have co-authored several papers and I'm only in my third year.

Because functional code is similar to how we think of math, it's often times easier to simplify out over-computation and you end up with the bare minimum of what you actually need.<p>* Generic programming.  Things like currying and first-order functions are great for separating (or combining) context from computation.  When you understand where the difference lies, you can write your code such that it is adaptable in the most efficient way (read: generic).<p>* Lambda functions.  Infinitely useful in a language that uses them, like Python.  Lambda's are great for doing work over large collections of data without getting lost in for loops (i.e. map, reduce, sort, fold).<p>FWIW: I learned what I know from Haskell",1275802336

You are, however, constantly faced with changing your direction, compromising your vision or similar, all for some potential upside and downside.  That's the nature of business, and trying to tie it to moral questions doesn't do justice to the line of reasoning one should employ.<p>Of course you should be moral, but most business questions aren't a question of morality, but of direction and the most appropriate path to achieve your objectives.",1275801250

Robotic arms don't care when other robotic arms die—and neither do we. Paperclips don't care about increasing in number, even if someone is trying to make it so. What we have to ask is not ""what does the universe say about right and wrong?"" (because the answer is ""nothing"") but rather ""what do <i>our minds</i> say about right and wrong?""—that is, ""what is the human utility function?""<p>The problem with that, of course, is that even within our species, we have many different (and mutually-exclusive!) utility functions; sociopaths, for example, calculate theirs noticeably differently. So, it still ends up turned into a problem of cultural meta-ethics. That is, it's no longer a matter of ""who do we shun and revile?"" but ""how do we get along?"" or perhaps ""do we <i>want</i> to get along?""

In that battle the general Han Xin organized his troops against a river, with no prospect of retreat. Apparently it focused their fighting abilities immensely.<p>From the wikipedia article:
At the feast after the battle, Han Xin's officers, still somewhat incredulous at their own good fortune, inquired into the rationale for the astounding deployments. Han Xin explained that as he was commanding a ragtag army and he was not a general of high renown, he had to resort to such drastic measures to force everyone to fight hard. This led to the saying ""You achieve survival by fighting from a position of certain death (置之死地而後生)""",1275800644

1408035,comment,1407932,1407932,0,0,miratrix,,,"Would you mind going out of the country?  I don't exactly know how University of Waterloo's co-op program works for an American working in Canada, but I'd highly recommend University of Waterloo (in Waterloo, Ontario, about 2 hours from Toronto, 4 hours from Detroit, and 2 from Buffalo).<p>Before I start, I'll start by stating that I'm a U. Waterloo alum, though from Computer Engineering, not CS...  so what I'm describing in terms of their CS programs might not be entirely accurate... and that I might be a bit biased.<p>1. Co-op (or internships).  University of Waterloo's CS and engineering degrees are all 5 years long, with year-round 4 month terms in which you're either studying or working.  You have 8 study terms and 6 work terms in those 5 years, and in the work terms, you're hired in real life companies and work in real life jobs working on real life projects, for companies like Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Research in Motion, etc.  Not only that, you get paid a decent salary (enough for me to completely cover my tuitions + living costs) and wide network of people to start from when you're finished your degree and a nice thick resume to get balls rolling.  The University actually hires a bunch of people to go out and look for jobs, and if you're good, you'll several offers from some of the top names in tech companies.  The flip side, though, is that companies will expect real work out of you.<p>2. Waterloo's CS department is actually under the Faculty of Mathematics, which shows you how seriously they take the mathematical roots of CS.  I've been told that they're very mathematically rigorous in their studies, and their success can be seen from the Waterloo's rankings in ACM programming competitions, as well as experts who teach in the field (like the people who invented elliptic curve cryptography, etc)<p>3. Waterloo has very liberal policies for Professors getting to keep much of their research, patents, and IP on their own instead of assigning it to the University, so a lot of professors are looking to get started on their research and spinning out.  You'll see a streak of entrepreneurship from both the students and the faculty there.<p>4. At least in the computer engineering curriculum, they never teach you any computer languages.  The first introductory class I took was in C++, but basics of C++ was covered by a TA in help session.  The data structures and algorithms class is in Java, but the language itself was covered by another TA in a single help session while the professor focused on the actual data structures and algorithms, not how to write and compile java code.  Through your 5 years,  concepts are taught, but not the specifics... or that's at least how I felt.  After the 5 degrees, I think I got most of the basic concepts to the point where I understand how computers actually work at a fundamental level, and I know how to get through the ""abstraction"" layers that so many people seem to have issues with.  If you understand how a transistor works, it'll give you a better understanding of why writing to a flash device is different from other memories.  If you understand how flash devices work, then it'll give you a better understanding of why you need different file systems to support it.  If you understand how the file systems work, it'll give you a better understanding of why, for instance, opening a file with a million small files might be slow in some systems... and so on and so forth.  I think one of the biggest thing that I got out of the school (besides not having a debt + thick rolodex + all the intangibles like friend network, etc) was 5 years of just learning and thinking about the concepts are all inter-related, so that when something fails, you have the required tools and knowledge to actually dig into it and figure out what's underneath all that abstraction that everyone takes for granted.<p>I know this is little bit long winded, but I'm of the opinion that the 4 years spent in college will not be a waste...  On the flip side, it's my understanding that the college qualities vary wildly in US (I once talked to a Professor who turned down a tenure track position at one US college where they were told they don't have classes on Fridays because of Football Pep Rallys are on Fridays!!!).   BUT, if you find a right school, just the people you're going to meet and befriend I think is worth it all by itself.  It's really going to be what you make out of it.<p>Hope this helps.",1275800426

It has so many problems and those problems themselves prevent any solution (e.g. how are you going to get politicians bought by lobbyists to ban lobbying?).  Given that, the only option is to make it harder for the government to enforce their ridiculous legislation.<p>Sort of buying more time for the hero to make his appearance and fix everything.",1265029167

At that point in time, it was (and still is) a huge expense to run a printing press and book bindery. Then, they took control over the distribution channel. These are huge costs- Lulu doesn't get your book into B&N. I was speaking to a future where bookstores are as rare as record stores as one where those costs are not significant.<p>It is just a historical accident that the people that control the printing presses control the rest of the process.  It used to cost quite a bit. With on demand printing, there is little need for their services.",1265028570

A lot of times people will ask you a question as a way of introducing a topic they want to talk about- ""How was your weekend?"" can mean ""Something really exciting happened to me this past weekend and I want to talk about it"". If they actually want to hear about your weekend then they will give a quick summary and then prompt you to elaborate on your answer, in which case you can go into more detail.",1265028551
1092251,comment,1092224,1092224,0,0,peterhi,,,"The first issue is why do you want to store them, just for the record or do you need to do something with them. Do you need to store that actual number or would a hash of the number be acceptable (for comparison purposes).<p>Databases are commonly compromised by SQL injection attacks that reveal the contents of the database. Some databases, MySQL for example, have functions that allow the database to display the contents of files off the filesystem. But on the whole, if someone has gained access to your database it does not immediately follow that they have access to your code. Only that you need to tighten up on security.<p>An alternative to hashes, but somewhat more expensive computationally, would be to encrypt the CC number into the database using the public key of a Public/Private encryption scheme (PGP for example). So even if they got hold of your database and the public key they could still not, realistically, decode the CC number. Providing the private key is held securely on another server!<p>It all comes down to what you need to do with the CC numbers. Long ago I worked on some software to track CC fraud for a major store (was a CC number used in store A also being used in store B, it was likely that the card had been cloned as most customers only shopped at their local branch), we used hashes of the numbers. We didn't even need to know who the customer was, everything was driven by electronic till receipts and hashed CC number.<p>Do you need the actual CC numbers or would a hash be equally as usable?",1265028536

1092249,comment,1091814,1092069,0,0,ytinas,,,">I know its fun to rag on public officials on Internet forums. But most of the ones I know have been fairly decent people who are just doing their jobs.<p>This could be said about a lot of people who did incredibly horrific things.  Virtually no one, no matter how evil they appear to everyone else, really thinks of themselves that way.  They always justify their actions in some way (e.g. ""The world will be better off without this race"", ""no one else is smart enough to see what I see, so fudging a little bit is completely justified.  They are too simple minded to understand anything else"", etc.).<p>In regards to rule following, people fall into one of two categories: ""Rule followers"", people who follow what the rule says, and people like myself who follow the <i>sense</i> behind the rule, not the words specifically and even then only if it makes sense [1].<p>People from e.g. your TSA example are clearly ""rule followers"".  Here is an article that outlines some of the issues with following rules to this degree: <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/6433397/The-Authoritarians"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/6433397/The-Authoritarians</a><p>Basically, if you can get people who will blindly follow rules you can accomplish just about anything with them.  It's also a very handy justification for highly antisocial behavior.  Of course people in my category can also use shaky justifications to engage in poor behavior but I can't claim ""I was just doing as I was told"".<p>I have plenty of ""rule follower"" friends (whom I constantly annoy with my heretical suggestions that rules are just guidelines).  But at the end of the day we can only judge people's actions based on what they did (rule follower or not).  Not how friendly they are doing it.  Jeffrey Dahmer's neighbors thought he was nice enough.<p>>and they risk losing their job when they deviate from it, even if they personally believe the rules are stupid.<p>If everyone would avoid rules that are, from a common sense point of view, stupid then their job wouldn't be ""at risk"".  They couldn't be replaced with anyone who wouldn't do the same thing.<p>>Same with the private sector. Companies that have the best reputations tend to be those that empower their employees to solve the customer's problem, like Virgin or Nordstroms. Companies with the worst reputations tend to be those where the employees can't do anything but follow the playbook, like most telecoms.<p>Interesting point.<p>[1] e.g. I don't stop at a stop sign if I can clearly see that I can go without impacting anyone else.  For me stop sign means ""the other people have the right of way, don't impact them"".  I find following the letter of the law ""all four wheels to a full and complete stop"" irritating, insulting and of little or no value.",1265028478

If a person asks you ""How are you doing"" or ""What have you been up to lately?"" you should give them a quick summary and then ask them the same question. This is assuming that it's a social situation where you expect a conversation- don't return the question if your boss asks you what you've been doing, and don't answer at length if the question is just a social nicety. The cashier in the grocery store doesn't want a detailed answer to ""How are you today?"", you should just say ""I'm fine, how are you?""  Hope that makes sense.",1265027793

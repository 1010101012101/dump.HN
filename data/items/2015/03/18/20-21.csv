9228652,comment,9225079,9225341,0,0,danudey,,,"The problem with Simcity is that &#x27;traffic&#x27; would basically take absolutely any turn that would get them to where they wanted to go. This meant that if you had a gridded layout of large, wide avenues, four-lane primary streets, and two-lane side streets, your traffic will gladly back up for miles outside of town because everyone entering your city is trying to take a two-lane side street to get to their destination, <i>even if it&#x27;s on an avenue</i>, just because turning onto that side street is the first available option.<p>They later updated the algorithm, apparently, to do path cost routing, making it far more preferable to take avenues over dirt roads, but until then the only way your city could work at all was to create it entirely out of cul-de-sacs.<p>There was also an issue with the train service, where, when a commuter train came to an intersection, it would <i>randomly</i> choose which direction to take. This meant that if you had a grid of avenues, some of your sims would be waiting for <i>hours</i> for a train, because the train is bouncing randomly around your downtown instead of dropping anyone off.<p>Moving to a system where there were literally no intersections at all for your trains was the only way to make your mass transit system a benefit and not a liability.",1426712381

While approval rates are as low as they ever were for Dilma, strong disapproval like this is not unprecedented. Add to that that the reasons for protesting were all over the spectrum: from stronger economic action in the trickle-down doctrine all the way to &quot;we want our dictatorship back&quot;.

9228626,comment,9225079,9227397,0,0,danudey,,,"I think Simcity came around in the same era where everything EA did was online, for no reason. It&#x27;s like the execs said &#x27;online social games are killing us, we need all of our games to be online and social&#x27; and wouldn&#x27;t sign off on a project without those two check boxes.<p>Need for Speed: Rivals was similar. It was a neat concept, but it revolved entirely around online play that was generally just completely terrible. You get dumped in a map with 1-7 other people, and then you drive around aimlessly hoping that you eventually run into them, which you don&#x27;t. In the meantime, you&#x27;re listening to every idiot with a Playstation Camera screaming at their moms for another PB&J, or some jackass swearing the entire time because he thinks he&#x27;s alone in his room, because there&#x27;s no way to turn off voice chat in the game whatsoever.<p>Congratulations, your game is both online (but you can&#x27;t really tell) and social (but it&#x27;s actually antisocial).<p>Simcity is the same way. What if you could play online against other people? I meanâ¦ <i>with</i> other people. You could build neighbouring towns. Except you&#x27;re actually building neighbourhoods because realistically sized cities would take too much server resources. And then you can interact with other cities! By buying or selling resources like garbage pickup, recycling, and power.<p>Except that the servers didn&#x27;t work, so online only meant offline always. And the social idea was cool, until some jackass dropped into your region and built a zone that was entirely coal power plants and industrial zones, and polluted the whole region. Or built a city with nothing but power plants, provided power to everyone else in the region, then one day bulldozed everything, pulling the rug out from under everyone else and sending their cities into chaos.<p>I really hope that Cities: Skylines is successful. It already seems like a <i>far</i> more interesting game than any previous Simcity was, and it has a lot more potential as well. I love the idea of being able to ease congestion by &#x27;work from home&#x27; incentives, and it would be cool if they (or modders) could implement that.",1426712090

Keyboards were generally terrible, and I&#x27;d started using a Microsoft Natural, which is probably the worst keyboard ever made.<p>At my first job out of school, I&#x27;d drive my stickshift car home and nearly cry from the pain.  It was really awful.  I got into physical therapy, and started looking into better keyboard options.  I tried the Kinesis Maxim first, since it wasn&#x27;t too &quot;weird&quot;.  It was a big step up.  I later tried the Classic (same style as the current Advantage) and never looked back.<p>Cons:  horrible rubbery function keys.<p>Pros:  literally everything else.  The layout is, in my opinion, dramatically superior to the classic 104-key layout.  It makes more use of your thumbs.  It places the arrow keys where you can reach them without moving your hands from the home-row position.<p>I always keep a spare on hand and generally loan it out to friends and coworkers to try.  I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s been about a 50% adoption rate.  Some people just can&#x27;t get over the initial hump of learning how to use the thumb keys.  The ones that buy a Kinesis are extremely happy with it.<p>By the way, the keyboards last for years.  I&#x27;ve had a few keyswitches go bad (most likely due to my improper &#x27;cleaning&#x27; attempts), but they can be replaced if you know how to use a soldering iron.  Kinesis has even sent me several replacement keyswitches free of charge.  They&#x27;ve got great customer service.<p>Good keyboards, chairs, and monitors are expensive, but in my opinion the interface between you and your computer deserves high priority on the expenditure list.",1426711785
9228593,comment,9227421,9228343,0,0,malandrew,,,"I can&#x27;t tell the gender of many people in opensource unless they use a username that indicates their gender. Looking at #thrift right now (a project I contribute to). I see 40 people not counting the channel bots. I count only 6 nicknames that suggest that they are likely to be men because they begin with names that are typically male names. The same is true for a lot of the github usernames I see. I wonder how of this self reporting by women who say they have trouble contributing because they are women is actual gender discrimination and how much is due to people who have grown accustomed to committing the fundamental attribution error [0] on themselves, instead of applying the rule of parsimony [1] and looking for alternative explanations that might better explain their difficulties.<p>It&#x27;s also important to apply Hanlon&#x27;s Razor [2], &quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&quot;. Sometimes that stupidity (or ignorance) is the person rejecting your contributions, but it could also be your own stupidity (or ignorance). I have found that most people who try to contribute to open-source and fail have never read esr&#x27;s classic &quot;How to Ask Questions the Smart Way&quot; [3]<p>If you eliminate all identifier&#x27;s of gender by using non-gendered handles and initials for your first name in your git config, you can safely look for other explanations for your difficulties contributing to open-source besides your gender. It&#x27;s called applying the scientific method. If you hypothesis is &quot;I&#x27;m having trouble contributing to open-source because of my gender&quot;, you should obfuscate your gender in your contributions to control for that variable. Once you eliminate it as a possible confounding factor, you&#x27;re free to come up with alternative hypotheses for your difficulties.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t have my name, gender, or location on my github profile.

Cowper found something incredible, what appeared to be a megalithic structure in Tripoli.<p>Upon further investigations they found large numbers of them throughout northern Africa, they described all kinds of megalithic structures: dolmens, menhirs, cairns, cup stones, and sacrificial altars.<p>Speculation was that this was a previously undiscovered Neolithic civilization, in describing the Senams,  Cowper wrote &quot;there had been originally no less than eighteen or twenty megalithic trilithons, in a line, each with its massive altar placed before it.&quot; Amazingly each altar had an obvious drain trench where blood from the sacrifices flowed. Cowper even speculated at one point that the builders of these cyclopean structures were involved in the raising of Stonehenge.<p>They were all well-respected, H.S. Cowper had done some early significant work identifying and describing megalithic structures in the UK, so obviously he knew what he was talking about.<p>A book with the findings was published to great anticipation. Unfortunately as the book was going to press, an article was written by J. L. Myers, Arthur Evans, and W. Gowland who actually knew what those structures were.<p>They were Roman-era oil presses.<p>For a brief period of time, Cowper denied this was possible pointing to Berbers that referred to the structures as idols, but for anyone who knew anything about Roman oil presses, these were fairly commonplace.<p>That&#x27;s the long way of saying that the human mind has a tendency to find patterns and to try to explain those patterns based on their expectations.<p>But sometimes a cyclopean altar is just an oil press.",1426710191

So you have to price yourself based on value and not just a number.<p>For example, if you say that you charge $50/hour, you can never compete with an ok developer from India/Eastern Europe charging 10-15/hour. So forget the hourly stuff.<p>Talk about the value of what you have done with wordpress. Do you write about it ? What problems did you solve and for what kind of clients ?<p>My advice: talk about the businesses and their problems you have solved using wordpress. You can always talk about how you used wordpress (customized a theme etc) but for what purpose is the key for clients.<p>Once you can talk like this, you can also charge based on value which means charge a fixed fee or daily rate etc. For example, lets say a client wants to build a custom plugin that you know you can do in 5 hours, why tell him/her that ? Figure out what value it adds to the client. Then price your work accordingly. Sure this does not always work the same way for all kinds of jobs but it can matter.

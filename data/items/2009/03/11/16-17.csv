I still think that the numbers will be at the same order of magnitude.</i><p>I am not sure if that's a valid assumption.  Almost every HIT I've written has been at least 2x (and typically 3+x) for redundancy.  It is cheaper/faster to code for consensus than verify results.

512013,comment,511254,511871,0,0,dkokelley,,,"At an individual level it is hard to gauge the effect of lowered taxes on productivity and employment. This is why we have to step back and look at the aggregated data across all businesses. For the theory to work, there must be at some point businesses who are on the edge of whether to hire or not. High volume low margin businesses I would think have the most direct relationship between taxes and employment.<p>There's another aspect to hiring that we should consider. If you receive a tax break, you can pass the savings on to customers in lower prices or bring more customers in through advertising. You are right, just because you have the money doesn't mean go hire more people. Smart business owners know that hiring people should only be done when the value they could bring the business outweighs the cost. The point is that lower taxes can let you expand or market to more customers, and as business grows, you will employ more people to keep up with demand.",1236790283

512004,comment,511046,511046,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"This is a great idea!!!<p>Now for another idea that someone may want to run with: a similar concept for local farms that don't ship -- pickup only.<p>The idea came to me because I live on a small hobby farm and I produce eggs (thinking of getting a few pigs for meat & goats for milk...). Much more than my family needs, but not worth the effort of marketing and selling them, so I just give away the excess; nobody refuses farm-fresh eggs! There's another farm not far from here that sells bison (buffalo) meat, but you must preorder months in advance. His sales are from a big sign out on the road.<p>What I'm proposing is a site where small farms that want to sell their wares but simply don't have the time to do consumer sales & marketing could list what we have available, customers in the city (we're about 40 minutes outside Minneapolis/St Paul and not far from many suburbs) could prepay online and then pickup what they need when it's ready and the site can take a cut of the proceeds, or better yet, advertise local restaurants, cookbooks, etc to make a profit. Then the ""little guys"" like me can make a few extra bucks, the consumers get local, fresh meat & produce, and everybody ends up ahead. I'm not very interested in webapps, so I'm not likely to pursue the idea, but I think it's viable.",1236790146

511978,comment,511678,511929,0,0,ezmobius,,,"Redis has a different use case then tokyo does. I think tokyo is beter for long term persistent data storage. But redis is much better as a state/data structure server.<p>Redis is faster then tokyo by quite a bit but is not immediately durable as in the writes to disk happen in the background at certain trigger points so it is possible to lose a little bit of data if the server crashes.<p>But the power of redis comes in its data types. Having LISTS and SETS as well as string values for keys means you can do O(1) push/pop/shift/unshift as well as indexing/slicing into lists. And with the SET data type you can do set intersection in the server. This allows for very cool thigs like storing a set of tags for each key and then querying for the intersection of the set of tags of multiple keys  to find out the common set of tags.<p>I'm using this in nanite(an agent based messaging system) for the persistent storage of agent state and routing info. Using the SET data types makes this faster then keeping the state in memory in my ruby processes since  can do the SEt intersection routing inside opf redis rather then iterating and comparing in ruby:<p><a href=""http://gist.github.com/77314"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/77314</a><p>You can also use redis LISTS as a queue to distribute work between multiple processes. Since pushing and popping are atomic you can use it as a shared tuple space. Also you can use a LIST as a circular log buffer by pushing to the end of a list and then doing an LTRIM to trim the list to the max size:<p>redis.list_push_tail('logs', 'some log line..')\nredis.list_trim('logs', 0, 99)<p>That will keep your circular log buffer at a max of 100 items.<p>With tokyo you can store lists if you use lua on the server, but to push or pop from a list you have to pull the entire list down, alter it and then push it back up to the server. There is no atomic push/pop of just a single item because tokyo canot store real lists as values so you have to do marhaling of your list to/from a string.",1236789341

The article graphs the maximum tax bracket with the total tax revenue, with no account for the number of people in this bracket or the contribution of all other brackets in the system.  Its understandable, since doing the right thing would require a lot of data and would look a bit like calculus (revenue being the area under the product of two curves), and would sadly be too difficult for many readers.<p>But we don't have that data, so let me hypothesize a situation where this analysis isn't the whole truth.  Article states that we take the same revenue whether the rich are taxed at 90% or 30%.  Lets say that the left of the graph has 1 person making $1,000,000 in the 90% bracket, and 1000 other people making $50,000 in a 25% bracket.  Total tax revenue is $13.4M.<p>Now at the right of the graph, we have a dip where the top bracket is at 35%, so in the same situation, our revenue should have dropped to $12.8M but was instead stable!  Money on trees!  Except there is a simple alternative explanation, which is that the bottom tax bracket went from 25% to 26%.  Unfortunately, data on this is not supplied by the article.<p>It should be easy to see that raising taxes will raise tax revenue (not accounting for accounting tricks employed generally by the rich).  Plotting a small component against an unqualified whole data set is plain poor research, and the WSJ should be ashamed.",1236789051

511930,comment,510872,511793,0,0,discojesus,,,"""The reason 12-14 years olds seem immature is a social one, and NOT a brain one. I come from a rather different social culture and in my social circle a 12-14 year old was more or less an adult - and we acted that way.<p>If you assume someone under 18 is a kid - they will act like a kid, if you assume they are an adult, they will act like an adult.""<p>That's idealistic, naive nonsense, for at least three reasons I can think of off the top of my head:<p>1) Take a six-year-old and start treating them as an adult and expecting them to act like one, and observe their behavior (my hypothesis: the child will behave like a slightly-more-mature-than-average six-year-old)<p>2) Do a survey of people who ran away or were kicked out of their houses at very early ages (let's say 15 or earlier) for traits and psychological health. (my hypothesis: you'll find significantly higher than average drug use, addiction, depression, and other psychological disorders than in a random population).<p>3) Take a forty-year-old male (who satisfies both of our criteria for maturity: my criterion that he has a fully-developed prefrontal cortex, and your criterion that society ""assumes he is an adult"" and treats him like one). Now remove his prefrontal cortex. Your argument hypothesizes that he will still be an adult, since the criterion that is important to you - society treating him like an adult - remains unchanged. However, this has actually happened many times. It's called a prefrontal lobotomy, and its effects are well-known - it basically turns an adult into a child. Therefore, the prefrontal cortex has much more to do with what we know as ""maturity"" than social treatment. (and if you want to be clever and say ""well those who get a prefrontal lobotomy are usually severely retarded or mentally ill and thus not treated as adults before the operation,"" then just remember good old Phineas Gage. Treated as an adult right up until the railroad spike went through his head, and then basically became an impulsive child.)<p>""(And you got downvoted for saying kids don't have a pre-frontal cortex which is nonsense, if you had said less mature I would have let it go.)""<p>Wrong; it is a fact that children do not have a fully-developed prefrontal cortex. It can take as late as the mid-twenties to come online, and as late as the early thirties to fully myelinate.<p>Social expectations have very little to do with capacity for long-term decision-making. It's biological - you either have the equipment or you don't. My argument is based on what we know about the brain and on experiments already performed or whose results will be pretty damn obvious; yours is an argument by assertion based on blank-slate idealism and one article in Scientific American Mind which you can't find.<p>I know which way I'm betting, personally.",1236787540

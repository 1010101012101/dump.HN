But I wouldn't say adding a line to your installed apps, adding a line to your urls, and then creating your template files is a lot of extra work.<p>I do agree it would be nice if there was a convention for template names and block names from within those templates.

That being said, my mental goal is to run one test a week, and to collect 5% improvements on half of my tests.  The miracle of compound interest means that, if I sustained that for a year, I'd increase sales by 250%.

Finite-length tape doesn't make the problem any easier to solve, especially within the sorts of time limits that would be acceptable to users of static parsers.<p>E.g. from Minsky (1967), referring to a machine with a million parts:<p>""Even if such a machine were to operate at the frequencies of cosmic rays, the aeons of galactic evolution would be as nothing compared to the time of a journey through such a cycle""<p>So the conclusion stands.  If you presuppose an infinite tape, you get equivalence to the halting problem, and if you presuppose a finite tape beyond any non-trivial size, you get complete intractability.",1250348876

It took me 15 minutes to set up a single test on a single call to action, and then 15 minutes more to tear it down when I was done.<p>Testing a call to action should look like:<p><%= ab_test(""call_to_action"", [""Buy it today!"", ""Get it today!""]) %><p>And now, it does.<p>]<p><i>Since it's open source, have you thought about setting it up at Github?</i><p>Yes, I did think about it.  We're all businessmen here, right, so we can discuss the following in a mature fashion:<p>1)  Github gives out free hosting to OSS projects in the hopes of encouraging people to host OSS projects of value on Github.  This means Github collects links and mindshare, which they then monetize through selling hosting services.<p>2)  I write OSS (and provide statistics, and write articles, etc) in the hopes that it helps other businesses.  This means I collect links and mindshare, which I then monetize through selling software to elementary schoolteachers.<p>Given that I did the work, I think it is reasonable that I collect the majority of the benefits, rather than giving them away to a hosting provider.<p>If copy/pasting the git clone line is too much work to see the code, you may wish to reconsider using A/Bingo.  I made it easy -- I can't make it THAT easy.  But if you really want to see it in Github, it is MIT licensed, upload it to your own account and then you can view it in your browser to your heart's content.",1250348538

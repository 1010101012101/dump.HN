4965754,comment,4964917,4965606,5,0,rogerbinns,,,"If you do a Linux dev environment then you are pretty much stuck with Android.  (BTW I'm an Android developer who uses Linux dev environments). You can compile apps from the command line (ant is supported).  There are command line tools to do all the device interoperability (eg accessing filesystem, getting logs, installing apps).  However it would be unproductive to not use an IDE especially to manage the source files, their contents and locations, and debugging.  Java is also very nitpicky due to static typing and the normal Java API paradigm is to never make decisions and always put layers of indirection in front of things.  I joke that about half the code I ""write"" is actually written by Eclipse as I put in what I want and it then doubles the size putting in all the missing pieces, extra syntax, finding completions etc.  Such is life with Java.  The layout editing tools etc are quite nice especially being able to see previews.  Eclipse sucks but it is the least worst solution and you can make working apps with it.  You could use vim but you will create a lot of extra work for yourself.<p>For the iOS work I do I use Xcode.  Unbelievably it is slightly less usable than Eclipse (this is not praising Eclipse!).  I am constantly astonished at things it does.  Presumably eventually Stockholm Syndrome sets in and you train yourself to not do the things that hurt.  For a library I am working on that has no gui elements I am actually editing the code on my Linux box using emacs with sshfs access to the files on the mac, and a ssh terminal connection in to build/run/test from the command line.  To access the Mac desktop I use Remote Desktop (VNC under the hood).  One thing I praise Apple for is that their VNC server implementation is excellent - very snappy especially compared to the dismal Linux experience.  Chrome Remote Desktop also works although it sometimes has problems with special keys.  I have the Mac sitting in the back of a cupboard with nothing connected except a USB cable that ends up on my desk where I plugin the devices.  You can do some things from the command line such as building (xcode-build).  I have no idea if you can install apps, get their logs etc using command line tools.<p>If you don't want to write native apps then you can use PhoneGap.  It is essentially a web shell (html widget and javascript) with various extra APIs (eg contacts access) and you provide your code as HTML+javascript.  There is much debate about pure HTML5 webapps, solutions like PhoneGap, cross platform tools like MonoTouch versus native apps.  Non-native approaches tend to be quicker to initially develop and port, but can have some rough edges and take longer to work at the ""edges"" of functionality.<p>TLDR:  I have no clue about developing WP8 apps using Linux dev environment",1356433086

site when I was just starting with Python. I had landed up there
looking for a function similar to PHP's `array_fill_keys`. 
And it showed me `dict.fromkeys(keys, value)`[1] without
a slightest of warning that unexpected things will happen if its
passed a mutable data structure such as an empty list as the
value.<p>So IMO, for people coming from PHP background writing some of
their first Python code, it can be helpful at times but not an
alternative to learning Python from a book or some serious online

Then when a new opportunity comes along you can evaluate it by saying ""is that a better 5 year goal?"" If it isn't, ""does that get me closer to my 5 year goal?""

4965719,comment,4964496,4964496,6,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"Very clever approach.<p>It strikes me that the transition functions for a character or a substring is only dependent on that string, not its position. The article annotates ranges of the string with the transition function, so if the string contains repeated substrings, it needlessly repeats the same data.<p>To fix this, you could store the string and its substrings in a trie: the data is automatically de-duplicated. You may also be able to get the same effect with a hash table, using a rolling hash to efficiently compute when a substring is in the table.<p>This sort of optimization seems valuable, because the suggested approach is quite memory intensive. Per the Java implementation, if your NFA has N nodes, then the transition function needs to store a bitset of length N for each of N possible states, meaning that the memory usage goes as the square of the number of nodes in the NFA.<p><i>edit</i>: Also, thinking about this de-duplication made me realize a simpler explanation of the technique. You have a regex, for which you generate an NFA, that has some states. We also have a target string, that has a lot of substrings. For every state, precompute and cache the state transition produced by every substring. So you end up with a map whose keys are pairs (state, substring) and whose values are sets of states.<p>Then if the target string is mutated, you can use the cached state transitions for the unchanged parts to quickly determine whether the regex matches the now-mutated string.",1356431665

And yet those four cores are clocked only slightly faster than the cores of their competitors, while their 5th core is clocked way lower.<p>Now, NVidia's GPUs are top notch and while it hasn't been that successful in recent generations of phones I assume that NVidia's existing Windows software compatibility is why it was selected for the Surface.<p>EDIT:  I seem to remember that there were some big issues on the GPU front a couple of years ago with NVidia's design tools and TSMC's 40nm process having something of an impedance mismatch.

Spending per student is among the highest in the world. There is no reason to think we would do better by spending even more. To be European, we should probably spend less.<p>If we want to emulate Europe, and in some ways we do, we should reduce the size of our schools (e.g. France), end a lot of our special programs for challenged children and replace them with a high level of personal attention with the goal of integrating the child (Finland), and develop integration programs and job tracks for immigrants and tightly enforce participation (Germany.)<p>One of the boldest and most European proposals is to eliminate much of the Department of Education, which does not successfully regulate curricula and implements one expensive program after another without progress. European countries have ministries and departments to oversee education, but since the countries are smaller, the departments are closer to the size of some of our state programs. Eliminating or reducing the DoE to one or two small, specialized, service- and research-oriented departments might possibly reduce expenses while increasing the quality of education in the country at the same time.<p>In short, I think you will want to support fewer education layers, programs and departments, and smaller schools and budgets, if you want public education in the United States to be more European.<p>Edit: I would like to add that private schools are very diverse and their students accomplish many remarkable things. In addition to meeting needs that standardized schools cannot, and being run better as small, atomic organizations usually are, private schools and universities drive innovation in education and are the places today from which tomorrow's public best practices will be derived. In most European countries, there are many private schools, so that is another thing you will want to emulate in the European model.",1356430599

Imagine ""Compelling"" on the y axis, and ""Original/Unique"" on the x axis.<p>We've found a lot of patterns that make things compelling.  Next time you watch a movie, set a timer on your watch.  At almost <i>exactly</i> ten minutes into the film the exposition and character build up finishes and the plot begins.  Why?  Because that's been found to be a compelling amount of time to do that.  Take more time, and you bore the audience, less and you risk losing them because they don't identify with the characters enough.<p>But notice I said ""most movies"".  Because it's compelling, it's used often and that makes it unoriginal.  Pop songs are all around three minutes and the hook comes at a certain time into the song, every time.  So when you make something compelling, you are usually taking away from its originality.  If you go for originality, you risk that people won't like it as much.<p>Genius is when you can make something both unique and compelling.  It's rare.  And then it's copied to the point where it soon becomes unoriginal.  But that moment, when it's beautiful and you've never seen anything like it - that's a wonderful moment.<p>What Alexander is bringing up is that, while Hollywood films and pop music favors compelling over original, architects usually favor creating something original at the expense of it being compelling.  And he is saying that quality without a name is the creation of artifacts that people actually like.<p>If I remember right, Kent Beck introduced Erich Gamma to Alexander's ideas with the notion of letting users create their experience in software.  Erich took it in a different direction obviously, but I can't help but think that Kent had the stronger instinct of what Alexander was trying to say.<p>We have to remember when creating that startup:  It has to be original or everyone will have done it already, but it's additionally about creating something that people will want.  And there's the rub.  First because that's extraordinarily difficult.  But also because the original part is such an extension of your individuality -- it's <i>you</i> -- that then to modify it to adjust it to reflect what to people will like, means taking yourself out of that very personal work.",1356429971

It is a great irony that voters have much more control in how many taxes they will pay, but rarely in how they will be used. Whether through electing a president who promises to raise taxes on the wealthy, or one that promises to lower taxes dramatically, or an initiative to increase sales tax -- it is almost never known <i>what</i> will be affected, even when a new tax is given a ""purpose"" it is almost always in the small print that it doesn't necessarily <i>have to</i> be used for that purpose. And so our system allows us to often end up with the worst of both worlds:<p>1. Citizens perceive waste and thus push for lower taxes, yet there is no guarantee the ""wasteful"" programs are reduced, and thus often it is the important programs that are hurt.<p>2. Lack of funding in important programs is used to convince citizens that higher taxes are needed, but there is often no guarantee that the higher taxes will be used for those programs.<p>Notice, for example, that there are certain ""blessed"" government programs that there seems to always be money for.

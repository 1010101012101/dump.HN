2214900,comment,2214690,2214690,0,0,Mz,,,"I'm a former military wife, so I've moved around some.  The biggest ""gotcha"" I ran into:  An American couple cannot file for divorce while living in Germany. We could have gotten legally separated and I could have flown back home with the baby (our first, we had a second child before leaving Germany) to stay with family and waited for him to return to the US.  We opted to stay together rather than go through that.  It took a long time for us to finally divorce (that infant son turned 18 a few weeks after his dad actually physically moved out) but we likely would have divorced much sooner had it not been for this snag.<p>The other thing that has been a big deal to me personally is how different the food is wherever you go.  When we lived in Washington (state), there was an abundance of fresh fruit and veggies year round.  I began eating fresh pineapple, a fruit I never liked when all I had known was the canned variety, and my kids began turning their noses up at frozen corn on the cob. Only fresh corn on the cob would do.  Fortunately, they didn't mind shucking it so I didn't feel that was a big issue.<p>In Southern California (on an isolated military base not far from Death Valley) and Germany, good, fresh meat and produce was much harder to come by.  I shopped daily to get the freshest items and typically bought whatever cut of meat I was going to cook that night earlier that afternoon.  On the other hand, Germany had wonderful plain yogurt and ricotta cheese.  Both of those are typically sour and unappealing in stores across the entire U.S.  I have at times fantasized about starting a business to provide plain yogurt and ricotta cheese of that quality in the US -- or, alternately, making my own at home for my own consumption (which is probably a much more realistic goal for me).<p>When I visited Port Aransas, Texas for a week or so, I thought I was going to starve to death.  I am allergic to shell fish and don't tolerate fish well.  Lots of sea food there and basically no ""middle class"" eateries.  Everything was either a dive or very expensive and upscale.  I really, really liked Port Aransas and kind of wanted to relocate there.  My sons were totally against it for various reasons and I eventually had to agree with them based on the fact that I had such a hard time keeping myself adequately fed.  (They have a grocery store, which is unusual for a town that small, but it was also pretty pathetic and didn't do a good enough job to compensate for the lack of restaurants adequate to my needs.)<p>I also went to Southern California to school for 8 weeks.  I ended up on boatloads of medication that it took me about two years to get off of.  My respiratory problems and their air quality problems were a very bad combo.  On the upside, I had never been able to talk any doctors into giving me good drugs like that when I was bedridden (ie much sicker than when I was in school).  All those drugs helped save my life.  So I can't say I exactly regret it.",1297648438

For example, many countries speak Spanish.  If, in the future, you would like to provide sites for both Spain and Chile, then ""es"" is not enough to differentiate.  Do not forget that some countries have more than one official language as well.<p>Many global corporations with country-specific sites use different domains for each site and make their primary domain (usually www.companyname.com) a gateway where customers can choose their desired country and language.  Each country is handled through a specific domain, and multiple languages (when applicable) are often implemented via URL/GET or cookie selection.<p>Yes, managing many domains is a hassle.  The primary reason to choose such a method is recognition in specific locales.  For example, .co.jp domains are only available to registered KK companies in Japan (the Japanese equivalent of a C-Corp), so such a domain is very familiar in Japan and give users a sense of added trust.  Whether to go with such domain names or not really depends on your business.<p>If you need to put each site on a different domain (for some reason that you have not specified) but do not want the hassle of managing many domains, then you could consider subdomains: fi.companyname.com is the Finish site and www.compnayname.com is the gateway.",1297648413

While looking to buy a $400 item, I found someone with the item in stock who was willing to ship (note: not in the USA, many merchants will not ship internationally, including Amazon on big-ticket items).<p>After some back-and-forth, the order was placed, and this small online retailer had my business.<p>But then - 5 days after the order was placed - an email came back.  We want an international wire transfer instead of mastercard payment.  No way, I said - a wire transfer is a black hole where I have no comebak.  I offered a PayPal payment instead.  No, they said, wire transfer or nothing.  I cannot for the life of me understand this logic.  It's not like I'm buying and shipping to Nigeria or some other known fraud location.  If it was about mastercard fees, I would have happily paid a 2 or 3% surcharge.  It still would have been cheaper than having to drive to my bank, sit in a queue, organise forms and pay $20 for a wire transfer.<p>So the answer was no credit card, no sale, and they didn't get the sale.  The sale instead went to a combination of Amazon and a third-party freight forwarding company.  The combined price was about the same as the original merchant.<p>Why anyone would offer to ship internationally and then request a wire transfer is beyond me.

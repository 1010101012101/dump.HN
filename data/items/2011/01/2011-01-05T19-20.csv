2072222,comment,2068105,2071973,0,0,srean,,,"Selecting proper priors is quite a contentious issue, mainly because there does not seem to be one perfect answer. Though there are a few guidelines one can follow. One of them is what you pointed, building up a tower of hyperparameters. Hyperparameters have the same feeling as ""turtles all the way down"" but aren't so bad if you have sufficient observations. Then one can prove that any bias because of the priors will disappear in the limit. But for one off decisions that is not very useful.<p>In the legal case example, maybe some clarity maybe had in considering what does the prior mean. A answer is: say you have to bet a million dollars on whether the person is guilty or not without knowing anything about the person how would you distribute your million dollars between the two events. Yes it is subjective and personal, but it is hardly ever going to be 50:50. One can push the $1,000,000 analogy further. One can fix a cost for a mistake: whats the cost of a wrong conviction and whats the cost for setting a guilty man free. Then the final decision can be based on reducing the financial risk based on the likelihoods.<p>One may bring the socio-economic status in forming the priors but one may not consider any information source that considers the accused.",1294257437

One such thing are my logs: I parse and tag them before storing them, and the relational model does not lend itself to that kind of storage.<p>Document stores, however, work beautifully. I can store entries like this:<p>{

I excelled at the whole hockey-stick curve and the ""we will enhance shareholder value by doing x"" (I always put in this Cryptonomicon quote to see if anyone noticed - noone ever did). The businessplans I wrote were flashy, followed the agreed format (index, executive summary, etc. etc.) and sold the product well.<p>What I see now, but didn't then was:<p>1) The more shiny your businessplan is the more clueless investors you'll attract. (Clueless investors say ""oohh that's amazing growth you show in that graph"", good investors say ""yeah so what, where are the assumptions?"" Dealing with clueless investors takes up a lot of time, knowledgeabe investors will back you with a plan written on the back of a napkin if the think you can pull it off.<p>2) As mentioned in the article, a businessplan isn't a business. I would start to believe my own hype and act like we were all already riding the hockeystick to startup fame.<p>3) Businessplans tend to get stale, and (bad) investors will expect you to do what your businessplan tells you to do. Even when conditions have changed, which they always do.<p>Now I see businessplans as shallow shiny objects that don't really deliver any value. A one page strategy plan and an excel chart tracking numbers is sufficient, at least in the early stages.

The suggestions were full of flaws, complex and inefficient to implement, and no one liked them. But he was the only guy releasing code.

In particular, the author seems to confuse open source software with open development processes.<p>To answer the specific questions in the article:<p>1. <i>Well where did [Asus] get the source code for [Android 3.0]?</i><p>Asus is a member of the Open Handset Alliance. Since they're a member of the organization responsible for developing Android, they necessarily have access to source code to their unreleased products.<p>2. <i>Well where did they get the source code for [the new music player]?</i><p>Note that the title of the linked article is ""Download the <i>leaked</i> Android Honeycomb music app now."" This means that someone with privileged access to unreleased Android software made a copy of that and released it publicly, and, most likely, illegally.<p>3. <i>I don’t see it? I can’t find it? There’s no updates for the SDK that contain the 3.0 API calls?</i><p>Correct. Android 3.0 has not been released yet, and thus, its source code is not available to anyone outside of the Open Handset Alliance.<p>4. <i>So Asus has some kind of special deal with Google to be able to get early access to the “open” platform which is dubbed “Android”?</i><p>Yes and no. Asus and Google are both members of the Open Handset Alliance, which owns and develops Android. Google doesn't own Android, they simply contribute a great deal of engineering talent to the Open Handset Alliance. Thus, both Asus and Google have access to unreleased versions of Android.<p>5. <i>Where is Honeycomb for the rest of us?</i><p>Unavailable. You're only legally entitled to a copy of the Honeycomb source if you purchase a device with Honeycomb on it, or otherwise legitimately receive the software. The Open Handset Alliance has decided to distribute publicly the source code to released versions of Android, rather than only distributing corresponding source to individuals who purchase devices. This is above and beyond their legal obligations under the GPL.<p>Android is developed privately, but released publicly under an open source license. Nothing in that license compels the Open Handset Alliance to work in public.",1294255379

  * much much easier discovery process for average users
  * much higher purchaser confidence (due to b and c)
  * lower purchase activation energy
 </code></pre>
All of these together mean that apps which traditionally scraped by as shareware, thrilled if they got 5% conversion, can now just sell at an impulse-purchase price of $1-5.  Larger professionally-produced titles, like games, that have always had problems with piracy, no longer have to overcharge the people who do pay in order to compensate for those who would have paid, but didn't.<p>*: Part of this analysis is based on the assumption that if the app store DRM gets cracked (likely), the procedure is sufficiently unpalatable that it cracking is not widespread.  There are a large number of pirates of convenience out there, who if faced with an app store where what they want is noticeably less expensive than it was before, might decide it's not worth the risk/bother.",1294254559

This steering can't be locally controlled because the device can't see past the plasma sheath.  It can't be remote controlled because the plasma sheath stops transmissions.

6730420,comment,6729915,6729915,4,0,yetanotherphd,,,"For people who are saying &quot;how could economists be so stupid&quot; here is some background:<p>First, economics as a field has somewhat fallen into a trap where people are overly focused on models that are analytically tractable.  This leads them to use unrealistic models that can be solved with infinite horizons, rather than realistic models with finite horizons.<p>Second, there is always a limit to how realistic your model can be, so unless there is a strong reason to think that heterogeneity is important in your model, you probably won&#x27;t include it.  In this case it may not have been completely obvious that heterogeneity was really important in analyzing the effects of stimulus.<p>Finally, most people with economics degrees are about as privileged as people with the same degree level in other fields.  So being privileged really cannot explain disagreements between economists and other educated people.",1384401377

I picked the ones you would most likely notice:<p>1. 3-strikes laws in all participating nations. Note that the US and France have already effectively abandoned their attempted three-strikes laws [1] [2] [3], but would likely reinstate them.<p>2. dvdcss and UEFI Secure Boot circumvention (including shim loaders) will become illegal in enough countries to have chilling effects on open source innovation<p>3. significant extension of patents for medication, increasing healthcare costs<p>4. additional regulation of internet backbone providers  to perform deep packet inspection for government investigation of copyright infringement. This would use taxpayer dollars to enforce dying copyright regimes. I assume governments would be delighted to have justification to tap the internet at backbones.<p>5. End of works entering the public domain. Copyright term extensions are likely just as the US has done, so the public domain may not see new additions for a long time.<p>I want to mention the significant curtailing of fair use in Europe, which would train young artists not to remix or reuse others&#x27; ideas.

   g = 9.8 m/s^2

The total amount of potential energy you can store is:<p><pre><code>   m * g * h = 29400000 J = 29.4 MJ

The more customary unit of energy in electric circles is the kW hr.  Converting a kW hr to joules gives:<p><pre><code>   1 kW hr = 1 kJ hr / s

Sure, the &quot;poor vs. rich&quot; angle gets more clicks and inbound links. But the real point -- which is a huge one, as far as the field of economics is concerned -- is that the &quot;rational (and by implication, homogeneously rational) actor&quot; presumption is under fire. It&#x27;s been under fire before because people have been shown, time and again, to behave economically irrationally. But this time it&#x27;s under fire because people have been shown to react heterogeneously to the same stimuli and incentives. (Not really touched upon in the article, but also worth mentioning: a third major critique in recent years has been the revelation that classical economics was highly skewed by the idiosyncrasies of the Western cultures in which it was cultivated and codified. It turns out that not everyone around the world behaves like 19th-20th Century Austrians, Britons, or Americans.)<p>All of this is huge, I repeat, because pretty much <i>every</i> foundational theory in classical economics is predicated on homogeneity and rationality. Every single one. The entire field. Even a preponderance of modern economics is undergirded by flawed assumptions borrowed from classical models.<p>I, for one, am really excited by the modernist, behaviorist, relativist, empiricist and frequentist challenges to classical economics. This is sort of like seeing a paradigm shift in a highly influential field of study play out in something resembling real time. Economics has always been based on statistics -- even highly sophisticated statistics -- but the inputs, so to speak, have been pretty unsophisticated. These challenges will help drag economics into the 21st century.",1384399326

6730285,comment,6725387,6726582,6,0,tel,,,"One more cool trick from the same article (slightly modified). It&#x27;s a factorial function computed on an &quot;infinite spreadsheet&quot;. But how?<p><pre><code>    fact = loeb fact&#x27; where
      fact&#x27; 0 _ = 1
      fact&#x27; n f = n*f (n-1)

If we ask GHC for the type of `fact&#x27;` then we see that it is<p><pre><code>    Int -> ((Int -> Int) -> Int)
</code></pre>
which we can interpret via the `Reader Int` monad as being<p><pre><code>    m (m Int -> Int)
    -- for 
    m a = (Int -> a)
</code></pre>
Now, `f :: (Int -> a)` as a functor is isomorphic to an infinite stream<p><pre><code>    map f [0, 1, ...]
</code></pre>
if we ignore the negative numbers. So we can think of `fact&#x27;` as having the type<p><pre><code>    Stream (Stream Int -> Int)
</code></pre>
where each function in the stream takes its own index and multiplies it by the value at the previous index.<p>Then `loeb` completes the computation using spreadsheet recursion.",1384398607

Hence Mr Snowden, for all his many supporters is probably alone in very subtle ways, even when amongst trusted friends.

In this case, it&#x27;s selling 1 product (your business and it&#x27;s userbase) to a customer (the parent company) for a large sum.<p>When you look at it that way, businesses are simply commodities just like the products that are offered within them. <i>The business itself is the product</i>. In that sense, the customer-facing product is simply just a mechanism to the greater product, which is the sale of the business.<p>I hope I&#x27;ve articulated myself clearly enough, but that seems to be the rationale that makes the most sense to me when I see seemingly &quot;fruitless&quot; businesses valued at exorbitant amounts.",1384398359

This led to a lot of funding and interest in AI and perceptrons. Then, in 1969, Marvin Minsky coauthored a book <i>Perceptrons</i> which harshly criticized how underpowered perceptrons were. Most famously, the book proved that a perceptron could not model a simple XOR function. In other words, a technique that many had been led to believe would one day emulate human-like intelligence couldn&#x27;t even emulate a dead-simple logic gate! The book was devastating and effectively led to a dark age of AI where funding and interest dried up (later, the term &quot;AI winter&quot; was coined).<p>The next big boom in AI (ignoring some logic/rules-based research in the 70s that I don&#x27;t think is very interesting from an AI perspective) occurred in the 80s, when computational power increased and researchers discovered/rediscovered neural approaches, including the obscure 1974 research on backpropagation. This led to tons of press and funding from governments who dreamed of killer AI robots and what-not. But, once again, imagination raced ahead of reality and funding dried up when said robots didn&#x27;t materialize. The field didn&#x27;t really die off, but funding in AI went way down, leading to another major &quot;AI winter&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d say the next big era of AI is the one we&#x27;re in, driven largely by applied statistics that became known as &quot;machine learning&quot;. This has been by far the most successful era, and has probably added 100s of billions of dollars to the economy (I&#x27;d argue Google is a machine learning company, for example). I think it&#x27;s also the most pragmatic era, as people in the field have really learned from the past mistakes of overpromising. In fact, when I was studying &quot;AI&quot; in grad school, my professors warned me to always refer to what I did as machine learning because the concept of &quot;intelligence&quot; was such a joke to so many in the field.",1384398151

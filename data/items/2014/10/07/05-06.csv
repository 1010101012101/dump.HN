Samsung has a lot of muscle and money to continue its &quot;hardware machine gun&quot; spraying tens of devices to see what sells, which is also aided well by a big marketing budget (probably the largest marketing budget among all, including Apple and Microsoft in the mix).<p>The push to make Samsung more equal to other Android device makers could be from different directions. One is Samsung&#x27;s desire to go with Tizen and sunset Android. This may not sit very well with the user base since the app market for Tizen needs to be built, and that&#x27;s one reason why Tizen may likely shine in the nascent wearables segment than in the established smartphone, phablet and tablet segments. The other push is really good devices from HTC and Motorola that come with the latest version of Android and (especially for Motorola, in my knowledge) the ability to easily get updates easily and quickly. If HTC and Motorola survive for a few more years and continue whatever good work they&#x27;re doing, then they do stand a chance to improve the overall market for the benefit of everyone.",1412661328

This works very well for things like automating applications or sites where page elements are fixed (e.g. finding an option in a menu or using a search engine). But it works terribly when trying to overlay semantic structure on dynamically-generated data. For example, it has no way of knowing that a list of movies is split up on multiple pages, with each movie having multiple genres, a cast, and multiple reviews, each of which has a rating and an author.<p>There&#x27;s also the additional drawback that it is hard to parallelize things in Sikuli (you would need heavyweight vms, and there are no obvious &quot;breaks&quot; in the flow). So doing something at scale is not feasible.<p>With ParseHub, one of the goals is to make it easy to express relationships (and we think we&#x27;ve done a really good job). We also automatically figure out how to split a job up across an entire fleet of servers.<p>Hope that offers some insight. Email me at serge@parsehub.com if you have any other questions.",1412660993

Developed a web-application(game) using web technologies. Apart from being intern for 2 months and developing websites for the college technical fests, I have no work experience or any perfect knowledge regarding a particular domain.<p>Why unemployed?: I started a startup in my final year of undergraduation and failed miserably. I have no time left to prepare for Interviews or sharpen my programming skills. I thought of to first become expert regarding a particular domain like Web Development, Machine Learning and then apply for a job.<p>Realization: After 4 months of doing some web development, Machine Learning, MOOC&#x27;s, reading books,realized that i am no where near perfect in either of them. It just been waste of valuable 4 months of time. I feel work experience is more valuable than reading books alone in home. So, I decided to work on my skills in the coming days/weeks/months to land into a job and then work on to become expert.<p>Skills: Cpp - Solved around 300 problems in various online judges(ID:kp25). Python - beginner. Javascript - Developed websites, web-application during Summer Internship.<p>What are the do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s that i should follow in the coming months, What further skills or languages should i learn that helps me in getting close to land into a job?<p>Willing to relocate for job and join immediately.

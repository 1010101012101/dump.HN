3438054,comment,3436244,3437716,23,0,joebadmo,,,"I'll take issue with a specific point: affirmative action. Affirmative action starts with a premise different from yours: that college admissions shouldn't be about past performance but about future potential. And if there's nothing genetically wrong with black people, then blacks should be demographically represented in colleges. If they're not, then there's something wrong with admissions.<p>""A black person that truly deserved to get into Harvard..."" You come from the premise that you deserve to get into college based on your past performance. That's valid, but you should be making arguments against the premises of the affirmative action, then.<p>""Furthermore, since affirmative action shifts the whole bell curve to the right, blacks are disproportionally more likely to drop out of university, since they are likely the least academically qualified to be there. This creates further racism as over the years professors tend to note that the blacks they teach tend to drop out.""<p>According to the guiding principles behind affirmative action, this isn't simply a consequence of the policy, but another injustice to be addressed. Blacks aren't genetically predisposed to dropping out, they just have very different social and cultural circumstances that aren't conducive to graduating. The things that you (I presume) and I (I'm Asian) take for granted, many black people cannot. A proponent of affirmative action would argue that we need more social college programs that help and encourage black students in ways that lead to better graduation rates.<p>""Many blacks that get into Harvard and graduate are treated as sub-students by employers like major banks.""<p>This is simply prejudice on the part of employers. Why should employers take into account how someone got into Harvard, instead of judging them solely on their performance at Harvard?<p>My point is that you apparently don't fully understand the premises and reasoning behind affirmative action. Many who oppose it don't.<p>[Edit]: I suppose my meta-point here is that it's easy to take a hard-line view when you don't fully grapple with the opposing argument. When you really fully try to understand the other side, you come to a more nuanced position, and a respect for the complexity of issues. I think it's parallel to the Dunning-Kruger insight that you don't know what you don't know. Certainty is a sign of ignorance, even in yourself. If you are certain about something, it's time to re-examine your assumptions.",1325969696

In fact, I'm going to be spending a fair bit of time looking at alternatives and networking.<p>In ecology, the growth you get in an environment that's continuously disturbed and disrupted is best described as ""weedy"".  There may be vegetation (and even some animal life), it's not going to be particularly productive.  What you're getting is lifeforms that are selected for survival capacity, not, say, wood or food production, or even necessarily stability.<p>Nial Fergusson, though frequently not the best guide, does point this out in his <i>Ascent of Money</i>, noting that one of the requirements for successful and productive economic activity is stability.  This applies equally to firms and individuals.  Many of the structures we've adopted (debt, savings, finance, subsidized mortgages, various ""golden handcuffs"") exist either to buffer change or incentivise stability.<p>Kicking (or threatening to kick out) the legs from under someone isn't that.<p>Unfortunately, there's also been a lot of cargo-culting built around this:  people in the U.S. who bought houses to ensure personal financial stability .... because buying houses is what financially stable do.  Unfortunately, that's confounding cause and effect.  You buy a house when you've got an assurance of lifetime (or at least long-term) employment, in part to help cement you with that employer.  Similarly, establishing large lines of credit (or revolving debt): useful when you've got a reliable, if perhaps fluctuating, income stream to meet those debts.<p>Anti-discrimination measures, seniority rules, tenure, unions, labor review boards, and the like, all seek to change the power balance of the employer/employee relationship.  Which, for any employer with n>1 employees, is greatly skewed in the employer's favor.  While this may make for an economic climate which doesn't expand as quickly, it may also make for one that's more stable in a downside movement.  Looking at economic growth between the US and <i>established</i> (e.g.: not modernizing, BRIC nations) economies, particularly in Europe and Japan, might be instructive (I haven't done the analysis).  However northern Europe (particularly Scandinavian countries) have done quite well over the past 20 years or more.<p>If your landscape is rapidly shifting and/or doesn't sustain the level of existence you're trying to establish, you're going to want to move elsewhere (physically or figuratively), reduce your needs, or strengthen your foundations.<p>As to Mr. Andor's statements concerning his employment growth plans and policies:<p>1. He could move his business to a more hospitable environment.<p>2. He could find himself competing (successfully or otherwise) with those having different policies.  This is ""letting the market sort it out"".<p>3. He could petition his government for changes in law and/or practice that better suit his business goals.<p>I'm not sympathetic to the arguments he provides, and suspect that he'll find that he's greatly limiting his enterprise's growth prospects by foregoing any possible payroll expansion.",1325968795

I.e. all of the things that you can get from the request (OS, referrer etc) plus a crude geolocation based on an IP lookup and a few heuristics (which worked pretty well for everyone except AOL users).<p>Seems like a foolish business plan (or maybe a business plan designed to profit from the foolish).<p>Then again I had the same reaction when I heard about Groupon's business model.......",1325966515

3437928,comment,3437409,3437663,4,0,Xylakant,,,"Full ack. Github and it's widespread usage is actually the only reason I switched over to git as my main VCS. Close to 100% of my usual use-cases would be well-served by a recent version of svn. I know, there's a ton of use-cases that benefit tremendously from git's model, but those are not mine.<p>I still hate how the raw cli interface with tons of switches forces me to learn git's internals and storage model. Git advocates usually tell me ""you need to know to unleash the powers of git"" but actually, I'd rather prefer not to know and regard it as an opaque tool.<p>Compared to svn or hg the cli feels crude and not well thought over either. There's commands that accept the full verb (add, diff, checkout, clone), others that accept an abbreviation (rm, mv), but no (remove, move). I can set that up using aliases, I know. But why do I have to? Then there's add, move and remove, but no copy (which is ""cp <file>; git add <file>). I often find myself typing the wrong incantation because there's a mismatch in how the commands are named. In that respect svn really shines in comparison.",1325966472

Yes, someone open sourced a service that is providing an all-around solution for data that's easily trackable-- but the user's location.<p>If you've used free services to convert an IP to location, you know it's not so reliable. And that's the issue with the open-source version, which tracks me to the US, while I'm actually in Mexico City and it's quite accurate (12.8 kilometers off).<p>Yes, there's a geolocation API, but it needs user authorization and when you're building a service that requires knowing the user's location without them doing anything, visitor.js appears to be both reliable and at a fair-enough price.",1325966419

He compared the cost of an employee to the value it can bring him as an employer.<p>A business simply can not hire when the cost of an employee exceeds the benefits, and if it can't make do without employees, it will simply go out of business. It doesn't matter at that point how much it cost to ""create employable people"" (itself a terribly loaded formulation, but moving on), because society has priced itself right out of the market, apparently.<p>Something a lot of people seem to forget is that if you want to use businesses as a piggy bank to fund social ambitions, you have to let some money actually flow into the piggy bank. It is not simply a given that money will be there.",1325966408

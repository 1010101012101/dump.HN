3440354,comment,3437409,3440132,1,0,Xylakant,,,"This is a false assumption and a flawed comparison. An SSD has the same external interface as a spindle disk. It does have does have different internal properties though that make it superior in almost all use cases though.<p>> You are free to disagree, but at worst, they are exactly the same, and at best, git branches are superior (and so far nobody has managed to demonstrate otherwise in the 160 comments in my blog). So, why would you pick anything else than git?<p>I actually have to admit that after reading the whole comment thread in your blog, I'm actually convinced that the HG folks won the argument. Since you're a git developer it's expected that your takeaway is a different one. It's probably not that you're biased, but you know the way git does things soo far better than anything else that this is the way you think and live and anything else is inferior.<p>However, my answer to your question is a different one: Different tasks require different tools. Limiting yourself to one tool based on one use case is not a good decision.<p>If I only need a simple use case and there's a choice of a tool that is technically superior, only with a complicated user interface and a tool that is technically inferior but with a simple user interface I loose the moment I pick the superior tool. A complicated user interface makes me memorize and learn more, making the whole handling more tedious and error prone than required. I'd pick the simpler tool any day if it fits. I'll go for the more elaborate one when the need shows itself. The tricky point is choosing the right tool, but that works both ways. A powerful tool may be dangerous as well and cost you a finger, hand or more. A simple tool well under your control may bring you much farther with less injuries.<p>For example: Have you ever tried teaching non-developers (i.E. designers) the full git user interface with all it's powers? I usually get about as far a the subset that's equivalent to what svn can do before they nod me off. Github's simple gui client that can only talk to github repositories is what most folks that I know need and are content with. So if that's all they need and all they use, why should they opt for a more complicated piece of software. To them it's all ""oh, I can store stuff there"" and I can actually related to that. They'd be happy with svn and they'll never move beyond that. The only reason they switched is because github offers such a nifty image comparison view.",1326052764

Is employment also dysfunctionally tied to health insurance as it is in US?<p>Diet, stress, mood, motivation, and physical activity all have impacts on health, and all are affected by employment status. Doctors and medications, while undoubtedly important, aren't the whole picture. Most people are healthier without doctors but with a good diet, a decent amount of physical exercise, and a motivated, happy life than they would be with doctors but without all the other things.",1326052705

3440349,comment,3440006,3440006,5,0,prophetjohn,,,"First of all, the distinction in the title kind of seems like nonsense. You should focus on hiring talent. If you forget about talent, you might end up with crappy engineers. If you forget about hiring, you may not end up with any engineers.<p>More importantly, the author's goals are pretty unrealistic as a strategy to be applied wholesale to all companies hiring engineering talent, or even just startups hiring engineering talent.<p>From my understanding, the author posits that when seeking an engineer, you need to find someone that 1) is good enough to start (read: co-found) a company with you; 2) knock the socks off the company in 90 days (read: in 3 months, you need to be talented enough to contribute in a way that significantly changes or improves the company); and 3) someone who is ""destined"" to succeed in big ways (i.e. start a new company that's changing the industry).<p>The sum of all this seems to be that the author is suggesting that the way to build a great team is to find and only hire those engineers that are in the top 1% or 0.5% of the field. I'm sure that's a fantastic way to build a team, but it's not at all realistic, especially as a wholesale strategy. These people are hard to find; there are only so many of them. A startup is probably lucky if they can find one. It's pretty unreasonable to expect any company to build a team of exclusively these kind of engineers.<p>It's a nice suggestion, but until we figure out how to come up with these amazing engineers, it doesn't solve anyone's problem of building a great team.",1326052618

I wouldn't recommend those characters to anyone. Plus the Daily Show is primarily comedy rather than news, the news is incidental to understanding the comedy. I get my primary news from non-US websites like BBC and Al Jazeera (and tech-specific websites like Ars for interesting news) and what floats over to HN, occasionally I'll watch a few youtube channels, if I feel like paddling down piss-creek I'll watch CNN which is probably what the GP is looking for if they want modest bias in the other direction.",1326052408
3440344,comment,3439234,3440289,4,0,latchkey,,,"Here is my problem with that statement:<p>You are saying that you <i>only</i> have code which is entirely private. This is most likely code you wrote for your employeer, which you can't show me anyway because chances are that it is NDA private. Or, you have code which you wrote for say, an iPhone app which you are probably never going to show to anyone. That is all fine.<p>However, you are also telling me that you've never integrated any open source projects into your code or relied on any non-commercial external libraries. Or, maybe you have done that.<p>But then I have to wonder why you've never contributed back to any of these projects that you've depended on. If you are a great dev, I'm sure you found them lacking in some way and wanted to contribute a bit back to them.<p>Thus, we've come full circle. Any developer that I would want to hire, has figured out that there is a massive ecosystem of open source projects out there. They are integrating them and contributing <i>something</i> back to them. They are drawn to these projects like flys to sh*t. These projects teach them new tricks because they are studying others code. They are drawn to give back to these projects because they are taking so much good from them. That is what makes a good developer in my eyes.<p>Here is a really good case in point example. Last night I was working with the amazing Underscore.js library, which I'm fairly new to. I found that I wanted to do something with it, couldn't figure it out and made a suggestion on how to improve it [1]. Someone from the community responded quickly, we had a bit of really positive back and forth and in the end I learned something new about the library. I expect that anyone I hire has the gumption to also be doing similar work.<p>Go fork some projects.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/issues/425"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/issues/425</a>",1326052392

3440336,comment,3438533,3439059,4,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I think you're being too critical and you're at risk of coming off as a know-it-all here. On the whole you're right in your criticisms but I think you're taking too narrow of a view of this.<p>First off, it's close enough. Close enough is more than enough for something like this as Facebook has rules about looking too much like the rest of the site. Having it be close but not quite Facebook-style is great for plausible deniability if they ever gave you a problem and you were inclined to try to defend yourself (it may be a losing battle but at least you have the option).<p>The author makes it clear that it's based on Twitter's bootstrap so it's not surprising to see it just ""painted blue"" as you say. Honestly, I looked at this and saw that it was more than enough to get you started.<p>Whenever you create a boilerplate, especially one that you release to the public, you walk a fine line between offering a solid, customizable foundation and giving people far too much structure that they have to undo. Every single framework I've ever seen (even the one I made for myself) has been criticized for being pretty much a completed project sans content. It's almost a losing battle. Give people too much and they complain it's no longer a boilerplate. Give them too little and they say there's not enough for it to be useful. I think this project walks that line quite nicely.<p>So I guess what I'm saying is give the guy a break. This is cool and useful. It doesn't look cheap either. I think you went too far with that statement. It isn't totally Facebook style but close enough goes a long way. I absolutely am not trying to be antagonistic. Everyome has the right to criticize especially since this got posted here on HN. I don't want to say you can't criticize but just be fair about it. It isn't as bad as you make it out to be. To me it's not bad at all. Though it may be bad to you, which is okay, don't you think there's at least some good things about it? I don't know, I have this weird paternal instinct that kicks in whenever I see criticism I think is too harsh.",1326052190

Is employment also dysfunctionally tied to health insurance as it is in US?<p>> What is the end result of growth that makes societies ""better""?<p>It depends who you ask. If you ask owners of large corporations they will look as GDP for a metric of how great a country is going. Doesn't matter if life expectancy is terrible, infant mortality, crime and corruption are high, no middle class, people living in shanty towns as long as GDP is booming the country is considered a success.<p>If you ask people what is makes a country good, they wouldn't care much about GDP, they would point to healthcare, crime, lack of corruption.<p>Unfortunately the news and the reports you get in the traditional media don't talk about that. All those analysts,""experts"" and economists only care about the metric that large corporation care about.  How many time have you seen on the news about ""the average rate of depression in Argentina has gone up?"". Not much right. But you might hear about how GDP is suffering.",1326052185

Huffman coding is very poor on this, and your decoding or a random stream definitely does not have the desired characteristics.<p>If you want to make it better you need to step to something like Shannon-Fano coding which works on collections of symbols and approximates the distribution much more closely.<p>On the other hand, you can step sideways to Arithmetic Coding and get exactly the distribution you want in a single clean and elegant model.",1326051446

With hope, you're not arguing that point.<p>Your distinct impression is incorrect in my case: The last several torrents specifically for shows not then available via other means took me several minutes to find and many more to download. The shows in question weren't tiny unknowns; in my experience, finding less-popular shows is even more of a hassle. If any of these had been available on demand, for ""purchase,"" or via Hulu (to which I subscribe), I would have preferred those methods.<p>Your own points are also not mutually-exclusive: piracy may be as easy as it's ever been and still be more involved than turning on and tuning in.

3440268,comment,3436244,3440183,1,0,OpieCunningham,,,"Are you suggesting that blacks have a higher rate of dropout due to AA enabling Q=8 blacks into schools? Firstly, your premise is flawed because if prior to AA only Q=12 blacks were admitted to schools, you would expect a higher rate of dropouts if Q=10 blacks are admitted - assuming we exclude a host of other significant factors for the purposes of analyzing your over-simplified algorithm. Secondly, your premise is flawed because graduation rates for blacks have been steadily increasing for decades. From 28% in 1990 for black males to 35% in 2006 and 34% in 1990 for black females to 45% in 2006 [1]. Harvard itself has an overall graduation rate of 98%, and a black graduation rate of 95% - hardly disparate.<p>Regarding your second point: A point system can, and is, absolutely discriminatory. The points come from somewhere. In this case, lower level education results. The only way a point system admission policy would not be discriminatory is if low level education results were not derived based on racial bias. Unfortunately, they are. Low level education will pre-select non-minorities for higher points values. So a point system college admission policy may be devoid of intentional bias, but only because it ignores the established bias of the pre-selected point values it receives as input. That in itself is therefore bias (and now that you know it, well, it would be intentional).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html</a>",1326050975

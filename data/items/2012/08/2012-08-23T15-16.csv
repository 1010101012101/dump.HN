I doubt they are sharing it quite yet but the one beauty of patents is we'll get the entire answer once the patent isn't pending anymore. If I had to imagine though, the algorithm is just accounting for the most likely word to follow the previous wording, that could have been formed by hitting keys that were next to the ones you really hit wrong. I'd like to see how it handles my wanton throwing of swear words in messages to friends. And, the use of l33t speak and text talk.<p>Example, at 0:45 he swipes to the right and kryuwt turns into letter.<p>k -> l (k is next to l)<p>r -> e (r is next to e)<p>y -> t (y is next to t)<p>u -> t (u is next to y, which is next to t)<p>w -> e (w is next to e)<p>t -> r (t is next to r)<p>The options are letter, proper, merger and keeper (plus something else further) Given the previous three words ""you miss ever"" the algorithm uses some prior dictionaries and knows that when talking and saying ""you miss every"" we get probabilities of of likelihood for each probably word. Letter ends up being 35% as opposed to the 7 percent chance you see any of those other words. ( that last bit of percentage math is an estimation given for the sake of example, in a true text prediction dictionary the percentages are usually small, given the incredibly large amount of words that can and do follow ""you miss every"" (chance, shot, etc are probably more likely, but not near those letters we kept missing earlier.)<p>It would seem they've made improvements on that algorithms.

For example, you now have a variety of choices if you want to drop >$50k on a <i>pickup truck</i>.
(2) We simply have more disposable income to spend on cars.  That were so rich we can afford to spend a higher minimum wage multiple on a frivolous expense isnt really a bad thing.<p>This of course also overlooks the fact that today, right now, you can buy a brand new car for about $7,200.  (I just bought a Ford Ranger for about that, but there are numerous other choices in that range as well.)  Even these very cheap cars are so much better in every tangible and intangible metric than even decent 1980's cars that its laughable.

But on the other hand, when you and your opponent are on the mat for your six minutes, you're the only one fighting for your team - all the pressure is on you and you alone.<p>Most importantly, this makes victories personal. You can win your match even if the team loses, and vice versa. You can lose your match and still help the team win (by keeping the margin of victory low, which impacts the score). You can have a personal triumph, and your teammates will share in that, regardless of the outcome of the team's score.<p>I know less about the Paralympics than the Special Olympics (and yes, I know they're different), but to me, both always stood out to me as wonderful reminders of the true importance of sportsmanship - not athleticism, but <i>sportsmanship</i>.

In this debate, it's only possible to take one of two positions: put another way, either you believe people should be controlled, or you believe people should be free.<p>I have a fundamental disagreement with the premise of 'positive' vs. 'negative' liberty, because it conflates separate, unrelated issues (as a corollary, I also reject the notion that anything someone else has to provide for you can be considered a 'human right').<p>And let's not forget that the Gilded Age also saw the rise of labor unions. See also: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmzZ8lCLhlk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmzZ8lCLhlk</a>, <i>especially</i> the last 2.5 minutes.<p>In my opinion, the only acceptable definition of 'liberty' in a political context would be something like 'one's ability to live free of coercion and violence from others'.<p>Since this necessarily extends to everyone, not just me, a free society therefore requires a strong judicial system, not only to protect persons and property from physical harm, but to prevent things like fraud, collusion, or any other activity that deprives an individual of life, liberty, or property absent their informed, uncoerced consent.<p>Believe it or not, if such a society existed, providing equal protection under the law, it would <i>certainly</i> be superior to what we have in the US today (consider that no one went to jail during the banking crisis, despite the number of laws [especially fraud laws] broken).",1345735841

They aren't even looking at the correct statistics to address the hypothesis.<p>The article cites the percent of new car sales that were from 21 to 34 year olds in 1985 versus 2010 and find that it falls.  What they really want to look at is the percent of 21 to 34 year olds that buy cars.  You could have an increasing percent of young people buying cars AND a fall in the percent of car sales driven by young people if young people are making up a smaller proportion of the car buying demographic.  Indeed, 21 to 34 year olds make up a smaller proportion of the general U.S. population in 2010 than in 1990 (<a href=""http://www.censusscope.org/us/chart_age.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.censusscope.org/us/chart_age.html</a>).

In 2010, it's $28,400 [2]. That's an almost 300% increase.<p>Federal minimum wage in 1980 was $3.10 [3]. In 2010, it's $7.25, a 130% increase. That's lagging pretty far behind new car prices.<p>You point out that fewer people are earning minimum wage now than in 1980, but I would counterpoint that more people are unemployed now than in 1980 -- by almost double in terms of the real numbers of unemployed people (but ""only"" a rate increase from 7.1% to 8.4%) [4].<p>Although car ownership did increase from 1980 to 2010 [5], total new passenger car sales actually <i>fell</i> from 1980 to 2010 [6], which is closer to what the original article was actually discussing, and would support the conjecture that there are simply more cars on the road now than in 1980.<p>Further, the inflation-adjusted income of people aged 25 to 34 has stayed roughly level from 1980 to 2010 [7], which pretty well jives with so much of what I've read everywhere else that shows a tremendously overall weakened buying power amongst the youth demographics -- which, again, was what the article was trying to be about.<p>So, in summary: the price of a new car has gone up a lot but wages have not, especially if you're young.

(especially in terms of wealth per unit work, given that this generation has vastly more participation of women in the workforce). The fact that we have bigger houses and more cars doesn't mean anything if we're having to take on more debt, or devote higher percentages of our income to them. And at least for your ""average"" middle class family there are often two wage-earners now...<p>Also, wrt growth, the argument I would make is that for much of the last 30 years, most of the economy's growth has not been shared with the middle class. Some of this is undoubtedly structural - the technology revolution has put a higher premium than ever on those with highly developed skills/education and there are certainly workers who have just been left behind. But if you look at the data, the wealth gains over the last 30 years have pretty overwhelmingly been concentrated in the VERY top of the income distribution (I hate to use the rhetoric of the Occupy movement just because it is very inflammatory to a lot of people, but it really is a top 1% phenomena). If this inequality could be mostly explained by education/skills, you'd expect something more like the top ~20% to be vastly pulling away from the bottom 80% of the distribution.",1345734483

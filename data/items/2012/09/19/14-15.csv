Just so you know the context when I say:<p>For what it's worth, if you're a HNer, I'll tell you something Ramit Sethi says often which would have been useful to internalize, oh, five years earlier: it is <i>very</i> hard to cut expenditures in such a meaningful fashion that your financial situation qualitatively changes.  (There's only a few big wins there, and lattes or ""stop buying books"" do not qualify.)  By comparison, the amount of impact you can have by moving your salary up is quite substantial indeed, particularly because there's just a <i>crazy</i> dynamic range in our industry and, well, most of us by default do not make choices which tend to land us on the top tiers of that range.<p>Seriously: I get people who email me on an almost weekly basis saying they got $5k ~ $15k a year just by asking for a raise.  You know how many trips to the library it takes to move your financial situation by that much?  You won't accomplish it in your lifetime.

Might of added a large cache onchip and that in itself will make alot of benchmarks whcih dont have much else running go alot faster than you would expect.  This may be the case, we just don't know.<p>Either way you look at it this has to be unique as far as apple phone releases go with lots of people expecting lots and then still falling in love with what is released and with this new one the general press are starting to lose the glaze in there eye's and in parts poo pooing the new iPhone, which is funny as this does actualy appear to be a good product release with perhaps alot of understated features which do more than back up the claim of 2x faster.  This in a world were people are expecting any claim of x amount faster to be backed up with small print outlining the conditions that claim is true.  but from what it appears as a whole this 2x claim is a very solid claim in many area's of there new phone.<p>I'm not so sure apple have as some are indicating redesigned a whole ARM core, but they certainly could of very easily replaced parts of it and expanded other area's and in that adding cache is one area were mobile phone chips will happily accept and get a good return.  Also when you write the OS and have a chip like ARM which you haeve more control to add and change things then optimizing for your operating system by adding a few extra instructions of tweaking the area's your profiling tools have identified as bottle necks and you start to get something realy nice.<p>I'm more a Android chap and never owned a Apple product but this does not stop me appreceiting there finer works of art and for me the iPhone5 has that gut feeling of being a good solid design.  OK so it has no NFC but Apple don't do there own credit card, do they, currently - watch this space.<p>I noticied a few comments saying the A6 is dual and this intel is single core, well there be quad cores and they still aint betean it, be looking forward to some more hands on tests with details - especialy the memory interface and amount of cache memory on that chip.",1348066596

If you are just squeaking by at 30k, and you get a raise up to 60k, you suddenly have an extra 30k per year to play with.<p>That can mean many things - for every year you work, you could theoretically retire one year earlier.

You could now afford to double your extremely tight grocery budget and spend more money on healthier foods.<p>""Lifestyle"" and ""standard of living"" are unquantifiable, which is why this is a compelling factoid, but the reality is that, ignoring inflation, a 10% increase in salary is a 10% increase in disposable income.<p>Now obviously if you have more disposable income than you need, a 10% increase doesn't mean much.

They have to be mixed elsewhere first and who knows what taint threshold mtgox uses to freeze funds.<p>For example, after the Linode hack the stolen coins were moving around and there were reports, from people who had bought coins from cryptoXchange or had paid with paxum, that mtgox was freezing those deposits because they were connected to the stolen funds.",1348066474

Some of them are subtle:<p>The first thing to realize is that bitcoins do not exist as independent trackable entities, in the system.  So there are no individually identifiable bitcoins that you can 'mark'.<p>Instead, address balances exist.\nSo, you might say, lets just mark the address balance as 'hot'.<p>This has some merit.  It violates what appears to be a design assumption of Bitcoin, which is that bitcoins are meant to be fungible; but it has some merit.<p>If someone tries to pay you with a transfer from that address full of stolen coins, you can just say ""Im not accepting that as valid payment. Take your business elsewhere.""<p>But, what happens when somebody - lets say an anonymous mixer - accepts, say, 100 stolen bitcoins, into an address that has 900 bitcoins already in it.<p>Now, you have an address with 1000 bitcoins. 10% of these bitcoins are dirty - but which 10%?  How do you deal with this scenario?  What if someone tries pay you 100 coins from that address? Do you say that transfers from that address are only worth 90% of the value they had before?  What if that address goes through a mixer again?  You can keep track of percentage 'contamination' but its going to start making things complicated.<p>If you accept dirty bitcoins, that weren't dirty when you got them (lets say you are a mixer and get a transfer before people realise there has been a theft), what happens?\nAlso, who gets to say which bitcoins are dirty?  A centralised authority?  That sort of breaks the design goal of fungibility - if you have to ask a central authority whether this is a real bitcoin or not, why not also just have the centralised authority issue them in the first place, and dispense with all the complexity?<p>I'm not sure whether a marking system would work; there certainly seem to be some reasons its tricky.\nI've seen discussions about this on the bitcoin forum; plenty of people there who have thought about this a lot.",1348065532

What he demonstrates is that putting the two causal theories together will still preserve causality. So when he says that you won't be able to use standard SR tricks to create closed causal curves, he really honestly means that any possible arrangement of the matter/energy content that could do that would be forbidden by the fundamental laws of the theories you're using. (Not just that it ""wouldn't happen to work out"".)<p>To phrase it yet another way, Geroch would say that you could <i>not</i> build a time machine in such a theory, not just that you couldn't use it to change the past in a meaningful way.",1348064720

(I've done little more than glance at his original paper... I never have enough time for all the cool stuff.) But my understanding is that his metric is ""eternal"", in the sense that the warp bubble exists into the infinite past and future. That's obviously not <i>practical</i> for any actual application of the idea (as you'd need in a ""warp drive"" as discussed in this original article).<p>Instead, people want to find a way of creating a similar warp bubble where one did not exist before (presumably analogous to the way that stellar collapse creates a black hole that eventually approaches the Schwarzschild solution). So my question is, if someone <i>does</i> eventually find a GR solution that ""creates"" a warp bubble, would it be possible to patch multiple such solutions together in a way that allowed closed causal curves? (I'm imagining sending a warp ""pulse"" from Earth to a distant star, then having the recipient boost into a different rest frame, and then send a new warp ""pulse"" back to Earth, for instance.)<p>The answer may still be a clear ""no"", mind you.

It was an immediate disappointment: issh is extremely unreliable, has awkward rendering glitches and a UI that can't be configured to actually fullscreen. Oh and it times out after a short while, especially if you've switched to some other app. iOS can't remap caps lock to control either, which would have otherwise made it usable for me. I didn't waste any more time attempting to fix these issues; the only way I see this  working perfectly is if I had actual linux running on the ipad.<p><a href=""http://s00pcan.com/photos/ipad1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s00pcan.com/photos/ipad1.jpg</a>\n<a href=""http://s00pcan.com/photos/ipad2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s00pcan.com/photos/ipad2.jpg</a>",1348063680

I personally believe that an interesting monetization model lies in examinations. EdX seems to be exploring proctored examinations with Pearson, but if someone can come up with a credible, non-game-able, non-proctored alternative, there's a lot of value to be created/captured.<p>Completing one of these courses along with the accompanying assignments only takes you so far. Grades in a rigorous examination, however, represent a credential, which in turn sets up much needed (by the candidates taking the course) signaling. Eventually, a lot of employers might end up becoming sensitive to this signaling.

(See my other posts in this thread.)<p>And you're right that batteries are a long way from being competitive with hydrocarbons. But with cheap enough power you can make hydrocarbons from CO2 in the air. The hardest part is concentrating the CO2. In theory the energy cost is only about a tenth as much as the energy content of the fuel you make. In practice it's quite a bit higher, but there are several research teams working on fixing that, including one by Nobel chemist George Olah.<p>Once you've got the CO2 you can use pretty standard chemical processes to take it the rest of the way. Olah advocates turning it into methanol and using that directly, but the oil companies have had an efficient methanol-to-gasoline process in production for decades.<p>One proposal to use that process is called Green Freedom, from Los Alamos. Their design uses a GenIII nuclear plant, and they think they could produce gasoline at $4.60/gal conservatively, or $3.40 assuming a couple modest technological improvements. They have their own way to concentrate the CO2, unrelated to Olah's work.<p>Get something like this and you can have carbon-neutral transportation using the vehicle fleet, gas stations, and pipelines we've got right now.",1348063580

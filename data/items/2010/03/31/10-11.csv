This is the kind of role a equerry/butler fulfilled in the 18th and 19th centuries.<p>In the 20th century, you could expect a secretary to do this kind of thing (maybe not laundry!), even if it was not strictly company related. I think this made sense for businesses since secretaries were cheaper than you, and some things you have to do on work time - e.g. banking, government interaction, mail.<p>Now, personal secretaries are all but gone and personal assistants are only really available at board level. So although companies are paying less for payroll, they are losing out since I know phone the bank at work, on work time. I also hate forms and errands, so the company is further disadvantaged by the ego-depletion doing such things causes.<p>(N.B.

1231399,comment,1226277,1227452,0,0,hackermom,,,"jSCrypto uses AES-128 only, a 10-round cipher with a small keysize, to which there are a number of side-channel attacks available. AES is also a very slow performer due to its computationally demanding nature, and still it does not supply additional benefits from the large amount of work it puts into scrambling data - a perfect example of another case of this would be the good old DES standards, with its measly 56-bit (7 bytes) keys, which are computationally more demanding than newer, safer ciphers, yet still so easily broken.<p>In comparison to this, a cipher that is both fast and also secure would be f.e. Blowfish, a 16-round cipher supporting 448-bit (56 bytes) keys, while still, on 448-bit keys, operating about 25% faster than the not quite as secure AES-128 does with its 128-bit (16 bytes) keys. Blowfish is entirely free of patents, whereas most of the cipher modes of AES are patented.<p>The second most important factor in a cipher's security is its keysize. If the cipher withstands all cryptoanalysis on its full amount of rounds, the last resort is brute force, and with brute force every extra bit of keysize matters to the feasibility and practical possibility of breaking the data. 128 bits of AES is today broken with modern parallel means in ridiculously short times (read: hours). Every extra bit of key theoretically (but not always practically) doubles the work required; a 129-bit key is twice as large as a 128-bit key; a 130-bit key is four times larger than a 128-bit key; a 448-bit key is 320 times larger than a 128-bit key.",1270032603

If the file sharing is similar to the iPhone (and it looks that way) it's going to be a lousy share-by-email experience. You can't use the Dropbox app (or similar), because Dropbox files live in the ""Dropbox"" directory, and your other files will be in the ""Documents"" or ""Presentations"" directory. And note-taking? Sure you're joking. The iPad is a ""hunt-and-peck-required"" device.

You wouldn't be paying that directly.<p>2. Value added tax. You do pay that kinda-directly, every time you buy something with VAT on it, but unless you keep more careful records than most people it's hard to assess just how much you pay.<p>3. National insurance. Effectively an addition to income tax that doesn't get reported as income tax and that (unlike income tax) is regressive rather than progressive.<p>Back of envelope: Consider someone paid £30k/year (modestly above the national average). They'll pay about £7k in income tax and a bit less than £3k in national insurance. The corporation tax rate is comparable to the income tax rate, and nationally profits are something like half of wages, so probably this person's share (so to speak) of their employer's corporation tax is about £3k or so. Call it £3k. This person's take-home pay is about £20k. Perhaps half of that will go to things like food, utility bills, mortgage/rent payments, etc., that aren't subject to VAT, leaving £10k; perhaps they'll manage to invest £3k of that, leaving £7k; then VAT at 17.5% on the remainder is about another £1k. So, crude estimate: this person accounts for about £14k of tax. That seems to fit well enough with Mankiw's figures.",1270030412

3826008,comment,3824247,3825200,3,0,Jach,,,"Let's look at something trivially more complex than a Hello World: a form handler. The form is just HTML, asking for a name:<p><pre><code>    <html>\n    <body>\n    <form action=""handlerhere"" method=""post"">\n    <label>Name: <input type=""text"" name=""name"" /></label>\n    <input type=""submit"" name=""submit"" value=""Submit"" />\n    <input type=""hidden"" name=""submitted"" value=""TRUE"" />\n    </form>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n</code></pre>\nThe handler is a separate file. This whole example is from back around my first year of programming, when (among other silly things) I thought indentation was stupid. (Which was one reason I didn't like Python to begin with even though I love it now.) The PHP handler:<p><pre><code>    <html>\n    <body>\n    <?php\n    if (isset($_POST['submitted'])) {\n    $name = htmlentities(stripslashes($_POST['name']));\n    echo ""<p>The submitted name was \"$name\"</p>"";\n    }\n    ?>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n</code></pre>\nAnd the Python version (notice the silly one space indent (I use two now!) and the silly semicolons):<p><pre><code>    #!/usr/bin/python\n    import cgi;\n    def main():\n     form = cgi.FieldStorage(); # instantiate only once!\n     name = form.getfirst('name', 'empty');\n     \n     # Avoid script injection escaping the user input\n     name = cgi.escape(name);\n     \n     print ""Content-Type: text/html\n"";\n     print """"""\\n     <html>\n     <body>\n     <p>The submitted name was ""%s""</p>\n     </body>\n     </html>"""""" % name\n\n    if __name__ == ""__main__"":\n     main();\n</code></pre>\nOh, and with the Python version I had to add this file to the directory it was in which I didn't totally understand at the time:<p><pre><code>    Options +ExecCGI\n    AddHandler cgi-script .py\n    Options +Indexes\n</code></pre>\nAdmittedly not that hard. I had an .htaccess file already for fun 404 handlers. I vaguely remember being confused for a while because the .py script didn't have the right permissions on it so the server's apache just refused to execute.<p>The complexity isn't that much different, it's just that Python provided no compelling reason for me to switch to it. (And, frankly, even with Flask still doesn't for simple single-file web-page scripts. Applications, on the other hand...)",1334120372

There is definitely a model to be made off players with disposable income who want to be the top dog.<p>Your second question is a reservation that I have as well. We have already witnessed a huge influx of people coding up DCPU-16 software for free, but such programs are only related to the software engineering side of the spec rather than the actual gameplay. Obviously we know less about the latter since few details have been released, but in the competitive game I imagine it could be different. For example, to build a really awesome weapons system and then share it with other people seems a bit counter-intuitive. So there may be room yet for a business built on custom, clandestine code for a player's ship.<p>Gamers are already a demographic with money to spend.

3825977,comment,3825766,3825766,15,0,_delirium,,,"Isn't the education system already pretty full of a pretty large range of game-like and competition-like scoring and motivational devices? We've got completion-based ones, ranking-based ones, competition-based ones, the works. Degrees, points on assignments, percentage scores, exam grades, GPAs, percentile ranks, science olympiads, etc. They were even made <i>literally into games</i> starting in the 1970s, with the edutainment-software movement. I can see tweaking these scores, removing some, introducing others, but the idea seems pretty standard.<p>Overall, though, I'm not sure the secret to education is that we just haven't invented a better scoring system to feed you Skinner-box-esque reward pellets whenever you do every incremental good thing. In fact we're already pretty decent at <i>that</i>. We're less good at convincing people why they should care <i>beyond</i> that. It's very easy to convince students that they should care about their grade and the badge (degree), but much harder to cultivate any sense of actual interest.<p>There's also some research that extrinsic rewards tend to reduce intrinsic motivation: once you start doing something for the brief high of getting the ""ping!"", it becomes <i>much</i> harder to bring yourself to do it later if the reward is removed, even if it's something you originally enjoyed; which means I think we have to be very careful in gamifying/badgifying/achievementifying things. It's a bit different debate, but Chris Hecker has a good talk about that where he worries that modern videogames are focusing too much on the ""achievement unlocked!"" aspect of gaming, at the expense of deeper and more actually engaging game mechanics: <a href=""http://chrishecker.com/Achievements_Considered_Harmful%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrishecker.com/Achievements_Considered_Harmful%3F</a> And if that's true in videogames, I would also worry about it irl.",1334119657

3825908,comment,3825766,3825766,6,0,aik,,,"I'm not convinced that a society run on supercharged external motivators is any better off.  I'm actually thinking the opposite is true, which is why the trend of gamifying education scares me.  It's a temporary and imperfect bandaid for a much deeper issue.<p>The blogger quotes Dan Pink, ""job satisfaction is driven mainly by autonomy, mastery, and purpose."" -- however I believe Dan Pink's findings are contrary to the blogger's points. ""Mastery"" is generally attained and sought for when one is intrinsically motivated. This is because extrinsic motivations are much less likely to lead to mastery as mastery is often not the goal in games, but rather the successful completion of the goal of the game.  For example, grades in school prove some level of proficiency in something, however grades are often very loosely connected to proficiency in the discipline. E.g. If someone tells me they received an A in calculus, I have absolutely no inclination to then trust they are proficient in calculus. If someone tells me they majored in Computer Science I have no inclination to then trust they are skilled computer scientists or engineers.<p>Alternatively, if someone tells me sincerely that one of their passions in life (ie. ""purpose"") is to build computer programs, or play with numbers, and they have something to show for it (which they must if it truly is a passion), then I am instantly inclined to trust that they have some competency and deserve some respect.<p>So this being the case, gamifying may lead to people learning at some level, however forming such a dependency I think could be dangerous.  Once the game is removed, ie. once the primary purpose of taking action is removed, what do people have left?  The discipline itself (without the game) may have absolutely no intrinsic value to the person, so what good is it to the person anymore?",1334118226

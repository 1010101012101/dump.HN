1331710,comment,1330552,1330975,0,0,kn0thing,,,"That transcript is misleading. Steve stayed with reddit until Fall of 2009 when our contracts ended. He didn't leave to work as a contractor.<p>One thing I should also mention is that our deal was structured in such a way that either one of us could've left reddit before our contract ended without too much pain (missing some carrots, granted) but we were still rather attached to reddit, the community, and our friends (team reddit). Personally, I did also feel a compulsion to fulfill my side of the contract and make sure Cond√© Nast got its money's worth. That may make me a tool in the eyes of most Hacker News folks, but so be it.",1273391910

The web interface is quite quick and has some nice features, but you can also perform most functions (replying to customers, creating tickets, commenting) straight from your mail client.<p>We're currently in private beta, but if you're interested you can email me at dave AT madwombat DOT com, and I'll set you up with an account.",1273389435

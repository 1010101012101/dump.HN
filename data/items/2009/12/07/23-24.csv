There are problems with this new landscape though. To quote from my executive summary:<p>""Advancements in technology have drastically changed the music industry by providing musicians direct access to resources previously controlled by record labels. While the Internet has increased musicians’ artistic freedom, it has also given them unwanted responsibility over their day-to-day operations. Musicians have to book and promote their own shows while also coordinating distribution channels for selling goods. This do- it-yourself environment has forced independent artists to divert their attention away from making music.""",1260229829

982560,comment,981828,981828,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Professor John Stillwell writes, in the preface to his book Numbers and Geometry (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1998):<p>""What should every aspiring mathematician know? The answer for most of the 20th century has been: calculus. . . . Mathematics today is . . . much more than calculus; and the calculus now taught is, sadly, much less than it used to be. Little by little, calculus has been deprived of the algebra, geometry, and logic it needs to sustain it, until many institutions have had to put it on high-tech life-support systems. A subject struggling to survive is hardly a good introduction to the vigor of real mathematics.<p>"". . . . In the current situation, we need to revive not only calculus, but also algebra, geometry, and the whole idea that mathematics is a rigorous, cumulative discipline in which each mathematician stands on the shoulders of giants.<p>""The best way to teach real mathematics, I believe, is to start deeper down, with the elementary ideas of number and space. Everyone concedes that these are fundamental, but they have been scandalously neglected, perhaps in the naive belief that anyone learning calculus has outgrown them. In fact, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry can never be outgrown, and the most rewarding path to higher mathematics sustains their development alongside the 'advanced' branches such as calculus. Also, by maintaining ties between these disciplines, it is possible to present a more unified view of mathematics, yet at the same time to include more spice and variety.""<p>Stillwell demonstrates what he means about the interconnectedness and depth of ""elementary"" topics in the rest of his book, which is a delight to read and full of thought-provoking problems.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/</a>",1260229815

982551,comment,981462,982394,0,0,Tobias42,,,"If you compare JRuby with MRI Ruby, the memory consumption is indeed higher in JRuby. I am no expert in JRuby but as far as I know, the problem with it is that it can not fully take advantage of threading and thus suffers from similar problems as the MRI + some additional memory overhead.<p>A Java web application however needs very little additional memory per request-handling thread, which makes its memory footprint much smaller when many parallel requests are involved.<p>100 ms for the home page in my Java app might not be great but, considering that 7 separate queries to the database are involved and that it runs on a very weak server, I think it is quite decent. And because of the use of concurrency (threading) there is a good chance that 100 ms for a single request translates into more than 10 requests per second. But I still wouldn't call my webapp lightning fast. I was calling java lighning fast because in my case I still get decent response times on bad hardware and with an inefficiently programmed application (7 db requests that could as well be cached and only refreshed every hour or so).<p>You are absolutely right about the rails app however. The 1 second response time is not normal. I just measured again and suddenly I get similar response times as for the java app. The server must have been under heavy load before (maybe the automatic backup). I admit that my quick measurements are not very representative and apparently not reproducible reliably, but still: about the same response time as the Tomcat with no database activity and on a faster server. I also checked a different rails project of mine running on an equivalent VPS. Pages where two simple database request are involved, which, when directly invoked in psql, take 15 ms, take 300-400 ms to load if not cached.",1260229610

Also, it has dummy sections, which are kind of like structs, except they can be associated with a specific pointer.

You can tie many of these pointers together and it will follow them automatically, which is very useful, although it can get confusing.<p>That said, it does have high-level-assembler features, like being able to directly declare and modify registers.

Let the six people be named $p_1$ through $p_6$.  Since acquaintance and non-acquaintance are symmetric relations, we can model this by drawing between each pair of acquaintances and edge of a certain color (say red) and between each pair of strangers an edge of a different color (say blue).  The result is then equivalent to saying there is no way to color the edges of the complete graph $K_6$ with two colors that doesn't produce a monochromatic triangle.<p>Consider the six edges incident with $p_1$.  Since there are five of them, we know at least three will have the same color.   WLOG, assume the three edges of the same color are red, and, further WLOG assume the other ends of these edges are $p_2, p_3,$ and $p_4$.<p>Now, if we want to avoid monochromatic triangles, we have to color the edges $p_2 p_3$ and $p_3 p_4$ blue.  But, to avoid the $p_2 p_2 p_4$ triangle being mono-blue, this then forces the edge $p_2 p_4$ to be red to avoid forming the blue triangle $p_2 p_3 p_4$.   This then yields the monochromatic triangle $p_1 p_2 p_4$.<p>Since all of the edge colorings after the initial three coming from $p_1$ were forced, this implies no $2$-coloring of the edges of $K_6$ exists without a monochromatic triangle.",1260227699

There exists simply familiarity and permutation, but most explanations of intuition appeal to some form of ex nihilio proposition generation.  What we refer to as intuition is the subconscious process of synthesizing previous experiences and transformations (permutations) of component parts.  It is precisely for the rigor of explicit predicates and rules governing the transitions from one statement of fact to another that distinguish the reliability of math from the fallibility of informal thought. As you so deftly described, the ability to entertain varying predicates and explore the possible routes without violating the rules is a stimulating task that is unfortunately absent from most lower math education.<p>I whole-heartedly agree that the capacity to identify your assumptions is a valuable skill that rigid & formal thinking help to cultivate.",1260227068

It's less harmful than some other instances because as you note it's extremely unlikely to cause bugs, but it's still noise that detracts from readability by obscuring the code that's actually relevant to the task at hand.<p><i>Would you rather debug regexps, or java code?

982439,comment,981323,981547,0,0,Retric,,,"IMO, one of the fundamental problems with AI research is the idea that <i>thought</i> is important.  When a chess program keeps track of the best moves nobody really cares how that <i>thought</i> is stored or retrieved.  What's interesting is how to measure what thoughts are useful (for a given problem) and how to generate useful thoughts efficiently (better than random.)  But, when people focus on thought implying something that people do, but earthworms don't do they get into a tailspin.<p>Language as a portable method of conveying thought is a great subject of research.  But, attempting to attack a human language in all it's glory is a huge pitfall.  Nouns, verbs, additives, adverbs, intonation, tense, and a 29 years of knowledge and I frequently have no idea what someone is saying.  But, linking the word ball, with the concept ball, with the sensory perception of ball might be possible today.  Link that to some simple nouns like roll, toss, catch, etc and we can start a meaningful integration of language and actions.",1260226815

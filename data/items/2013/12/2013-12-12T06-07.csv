You start with this premise, which you appear to agree with:<p><i>I’m not worried about someone finding out my secrets, because secrets are just facts, right?</i><p>and go on to an example of a diary, one of the most personal artefacts we have, and imply that sharing it all with anyone who asks (as per the above statement) is absolutely fine. The implication of the above statement is that all secrets are pointless, including personal ones. In the context of a society in which governments and corporations are spying on every communication and looking for ways to justify it, this attitude is actively damaging and is an after-the-fact justification of that spying.<p>I think many people would agree with you that opening up your private code repos is a worthy thing to do, and it&#x27;s certainly an idea worthy of discussion, with pros and cons (as you rightly point out, to do with maintenance and the public commitment more than anything else). The mistake in this article is relating that to personal privacy, and implying that secrets are just facts is a statement worthy of consideration.<p>If secrets are <i>just facts</i> and cannot hurt you, there is no point in keeping <i>anything</i> secret at all. Unfortunately other people in the world are quite capable of twisting the most mundane facts about your life (like your location at every moment, your sexual preferences, whatever), and using them to destroy your life, either because of their prejudices, or because of those of society at large. Witness politicians brought down because of some affair, or their private sex life - we don&#x27;t know how many of those are leaked by our &#x27;security services&#x27; for political gain but they certainly have done that in the past. No-one deserves that much power over others, and because of the asymmetry of power in our society, private information is far more useful to some people than others.<p>Perhaps that is not what you intended to imply, but that is the logical conclusion of the statement and your interpretation of it, and that&#x27;s why people are reacting so strongly to it.",1386831571

You&#x27;re a hosting provider. To you, cotenancy is not only a security concern but also performance and SLA. For almost everyone else, efficiency is way paramount.<p>Oh yeah.  More fair is almost always preferable to more efficient when you are in a multi-user situation, and certainly, containers are more efficient.<p>I... have always had a problem, though, with this idea that you should virtualize clustered production applications;  virtualization takes a big server and cuts it up into little servers (at a cost)  -  whereas clustering takes a bunch of little servers and combines them into a big server, again at a cost.  It seems to me like once you are out of testing and actually need a full server worth of capacity, you don&#x27;t want to use virtualization anymore.  Multi-tenancy is a feature I need, sure, but for the cluster syadmin?  it&#x27;s all downside.<p>containers/chroots do make a lot more sense than Xen or Kvm if you must virtualize your production clusters;  I guess that&#x27;s the idea behind docker;  make a clean way to pass around directories full of binaries.<p>I mean, to be fair, making packages /is/ a pain in the ass, so I can understand wanting a clean way to pass around your production code without using packages.<p>Really, the more I think about it, the more I see containers as an easy way to roll back all the benefits and problems of using shared libraries without going through the incredible pain of statically linking everything.  Distribute your &quot;binary&quot; along with all the libraries and the environment it requires.  Hah.  And actually?  I can understand why you would want to do that;   Before I was a service provider I was a cluster sysadmin, and I&#x27;ve put in my time resolving shared-library conflicts.",1386830858

6893131,comment,6889036,6889036,1,0,beloch,,,"I&#x27;d love to see some cooperation between courier services when it comes to last-mile delivery services. Any package sent to me via international air-mail, which is cheap compared to most couriers, goes through canada post&#x27;s last mile.  This is actually pretty brilliant.  If the package is small and no duties are required to be paid, it goes right in the superbox on my street.  If it&#x27;s larger or requires duties, it goes to the nearest canada post station, which is about a five minute walk from my house.  Canada post stations are everywhere and have great coverage.<p>Compare this to UPS or Purolator (which Canada post owns the majority of).  They always try to deliver packages in between noon and 5pm, when I (and probably most other people) am never home. They each have <i>one</i> bloody depot in the city, open roughly 12-5 naturally, and it&#x27;s a freakin&#x27; half-hour drive out of the way. Invariably, I have to go out of my way to drive over to their office to pick up my packages because they are incapable of delivery during the hours I am home (and they won&#x27;t just drop off packages over a certain value). Though purolator may be owned by Canada post, they do not use Canada Post&#x27;s last-mile infrastructure.  Horrendous!  Isn&#x27;t the point of paying <i>extra</i> for a courier <i>convenience</i>?<p>If Canada Post were to take over last-mile delivery from UPS and Purolator, or at least take over the failed deliveries so customers only have to go to the local post-office, they could bring in extra cash while vastly improving service to customers.  Why on Earth isn&#x27;t this being done, if not for UPS (which can burn in <i>HELL</i> for all I care), at the very least for Purolator?<p>P.S. UPS is utter bloody crap for cross-border shipments.  Any U.S. vendor who only ships via UPS does <i>not</i> get my business.  The common joke up here is that &quot;UPS stands for <i>Use Purolator Stupid</i>!&quot;.",1386830350

Instead, it&#x27;s more like a preliminary verification.  Most merchants who sell for credit cards, Paypal, or even ACH know that their payments can be reversed weeks to even months afterwards.<p>Bitcoin compresses this drawn-out risk of reversal into a ~1 hour window (0 to 6+ confirmations).  So if you&#x27;re OK with a very small risk of reversal, you can accept payments instantly (i.e., after 0 confirmations).  This is perfectly fine if you&#x27;re selling meals, or domain names, or alpaca socks.  If you&#x27;re selling a car, and you want near absolute certainty that your payment will never be reversed, wait an hour or so for 6 confirmations.  After 6 confirmations, payment has been reversed only one known instance in Bitcoin&#x27;s history, and that payment was eventually returned to the merchant in question (so no merchant has ever lost money after accepting a 6 confirmation transaction).<p>Now, for consumers, it&#x27;s a different matter -- there are advantages and disadvantages to Bitcoin. But for merchants, Bitcoin is a very clear winner.  And many of us consumers are very happy to buy with Bitcoin.<p>Not to mention all the non-commercial uses for money transfers Bitcoin fulfills, most notably remittances.<p>By the way, if you have an idea for a decentralized digital currency with the protection against the Byzantine Generals problem [0] needed to protect against transaction reversals that also provides &quot;full&quot; verification instantly, I encourage you to develop your project.  It has the potential to be a Bitcoin killer (then again, the network effect may be too strong...).<p>And finally, to correct a misconception, the time needed for 6 confirmations on the Bitcoin network will always take an average of an hour, regardless of network size.  That&#x27;s what the self-adjusting Bitcoin difficulty is all about.<p>0. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance</a>",1386828806

6893060,comment,6887156,6888923,1,0,memracom,,,"Uhhh... were you aware that basically all the GUI OSes were event driven such as Windows 1.0 and MacOS and AmigaOS etc? Writing desktop applications for any of those OSes involved writing lots of event handlers. And even before that, in the 80s when Lotus 123 reigned in the PC world, that was also built around an event loop. Same with Microsoft&#x27;s Word 1.0 for MSDOS.<p>TCL did not have anything to do with event loops. Its claim to fame was that it was a simple language with a small footprint that was easy to integrate in any kind of application. Tk was a GUI like all the others, but you were able to write your event handlers in TCL. That doesn&#x27;t make TCL into an event driven system. It just shows that when you have an event driven system you can factor it into two parts, the event driven core, and the event handlers. Then the event handlers can easily be written in a higher level language to reduce the lines of code and improve productivity.",1386828663

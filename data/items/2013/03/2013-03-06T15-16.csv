5331739,comment,5331267,5331267,11,0,rayiner,,,"So I got a Surface RT recently, and as someone who hasn't used Windows since XP came out, I came away pretty impressed. I think the weakest aspect of the Windows experience has always been the hardware that it runs on, and Surface gives us glimpses of what Microsoft can do when it keeps the OEM's at arms-length.<p>It's a deeply flawed product in a lot of ways. I don't know why Google can make a $300 Nexus 4 with Quad-Core Snapdragon + Adreno 320 graphics and 320 ppi display, while Surface RT at $500 comes with an aging Tegra 3 and 150 ppi display. And contrary to what all the apologists on the internet were saying, you miss that extra measure of power when you see simple animations drop frames or when you realize you just don't have enough horizontal pixels to comfortably view a pdf while holding the device in portrait mode (the Surface Pro's screen is a huge step up in that regard). Windows 8 isn't fully baked yet. It doesn't have the reassuring visual solidity of iOS, which comes from a painstaking attention to avoiding redraw flicker. The apps in the Microsoft Store, with the exception of some great ones like the Netflix app or Fotor, are of almost uniformly shitty quality. The gestures are well-implemented, but so undiscoverable I'd never give a Win 8 machine to my mother... There are instances of the ""old Microsoft"" peeking through--things that make you go ""did anyone even use this?"" For example, the background level of the headphone amp is very noisy. It's not a problem for music, but if you're listening for the keypress feedback, you hear the background hiss come on and off as Windows turns off the sound-card between bouts of typing.<p>All that out of the way, it's the first non-Apple devices that I've actually found charming. From the magnesium case to the felt of the type/touch covers, it feels like a device that's worth $500. It looks nothing like an iPad but it manages to look great. It's something you want to touch and turn around in your hands and the PC OEM's have never been able to bring that to the Windows ecosystem. Once you figure out how the gestures work, they are efficient and fluid to use. At least as long as you stay in Metro (and ignore the desktop bolted onto the side like some weird monstrosity), the UI looks coherent. It looks like someone actually designed it, instead of having a bunch of engineers do whatever the hell they wanted.<p>I'm not surprised it's not selling well--I wouldn't recommend one to anyone unless they have very specific needs, but at the same time I'm actually excited to see what the next iteration looks like. I haven't been able to say that for a non-Apple product in years.",1362585167

A reminder of a slow-moving government interfering with and not understanding technology to the point of actually damaging technology in the long-term.<p>The market and technological evolution meted justice to Microsoft in a purer form: loss of market share via improved competition.<p>I am a fan of Mozilla (by which I mean the lineage of Netscape and Mozilla).  I had deeply mixed feelings when the US Department of Justice went after Microsoft for attempting to coerce Windows users into also using Internet Explorer.  They made it especially easy to use Internet Explorer, sure.  They encouraged naive users to think ""Internet Explorer"" simply was the Internet, sure.  But they never once prohibited me from installing Netscape, Mozilla Suite, or Firefox.<p>Moreover, they never prohibited me from encouraging friends and family to do the same.  If those friends and family rejected my recommendation it wasn't because Microsoft was being anti-competitive; it was because at the time Mozilla was genuinely not-so-great.  It was my preference but not everyone's.  Still, I considered it my duty, in a manner of speaking, to support Mozilla at all costs because Microsoft was evil.<p>Yes, I considered Microsoft to be an ""evil"" (using the word in a very lightweight way) actor in the market.  I didn't like how Mozilla was being treated.  But on the other hand, I don't feel that anything they did should be considered illegal.  If I recall, the only thing I found especially distasteful was how difficult they made it to remove the Internet Explorer icon from the Windows desktop.  Like ""Recycle Bin"" and ""My Computer,"" it required a bit more force.<p>I also didn't like how even after I installed Mozilla, IE would come up in odd places like applications' help files.  So I couldn't outright uninstall it.  But flipped around, and reviewed with a modern eye, they were incorporating HTML rendering into non-browsing contexts well before most of us decided that, yeah, HTML is probably a decent platform for rendering styled text in a variety of contexts.  Might as well embed an HTML rendering control.  We just didn't like that it was IE's Trident (or whatever it was called back then).  We wanted it to be Gecko, or later Webkit.<p>I am convinced that Microsoft slowed down and all but paused their browser development effort with IE 6 at least in part thanks to the legal pressures they were facing from the US and EU.  I know that had I been at the Microsoft helm, I'd consider the web browser somewhat tainted and would try to focus engineering and sales efforts somewhere else where my organization wasn't feeling as much government heat, deserved or otherwise.<p>Years later, I think, they decided to test the waters again, slowly at first.  Eventually they awakened to the fact that Internet Explorer had been completely eclipsed during that time, and it has taken them years to catch up.  Some would argue that IE 10 is only today roughly at feature parity with its competition.<p>When you and I bad-mouth Internet Explorer 6, I recommend we direct at least a portion of our vitriol at the DOJ and EU.  If I am right that Microsoft's seizing up of browser development was motivated even in part by their legal troubles, then the DOJ and EU are partially and indirectly responsible for the IE 6 malaise.  Government meddling, I believe, actually made the situation worse for us.<p>But the EU insists on continuing to meddle, to continue punishing Microsoft even though the rest of the market looks on and laughs.<p>When people say, ""why aren't they going after Apple for iOS?"" I hope they are being rhetorical.  That would be awful.  The DOJ and EU should not go after either organization.  When one perceives monopoly, it's important to be as serious and objective as possible: is it possible that the preferred product is actually the best for customers, even if for reasons we don't agree with, such as ease of use?  Allow the market to sort itself out.  The market is doing really quite well without the meddling--at least among those who have avoided it--so, thank you, but no thank you.",1362584198

5331629,comment,5325491,5326939,8,0,davesims,,,"A few years ago this comment would have made me facepalm, bang my head on the corner of my bulky CRT monitor and look for the nearest ice pick to stab through my eardrums. Kind of like I did when I read the transcript of Joel and Jeff's reaction to Uncle Bob and SOLID.<p>These days it just makes me sad, for two reasons and not (probably) the ones you think. It makes me sad mainly because, well, in a LOT of ways <i>you're not wrong</i>. You can live (and live, and live) in a comfortable bubble between the time a new codebase is started and the time technical debt settles in and makes new features of nearly any kind far more expensive than they're worth, for an entire career. You can deliver a lot of software that way.<p>You can also develop some pretty good habits (as they did in the days before TDD frameworks) around manual testing and general experience, that mitigates the onset of technical debt and bad architectures. The further down <i>that</i> path you go, the better you get and the more successful projects you complete, the less TDD will seem like a Good Idea, and more like, as you put it, someone trying to ""sell a religion.""<p>I've been in the industry 15 years, and I've worked with a <i>lot</i> of guys like that think like this and gone a long way down that path. Probably like you. Some really, really smart guys that I've learned from and admired. Some of the smartest coders I've worked with. They had unreal IQs and analytical strengths that always knocked me out. They could crank out features very, very fast.<p>And they wrote some of the worst code I've ever seen. Not <i>dumb</i> code. <i>Bad</i> code. Awful. A trail of debt to make the heart sink and the eyes roll back: long, 300-600 line methods, inlined sorting algorithms because maybe they thought built-in Hash's search was slower than they could write themselves. Early denormalization. Unclear intentions, poorly named methods, and (here's the overall characteristic): non-idiomatic code. Code that doesn't follow conventions, code that is hard to read, impossible to reuse, obviously unclear in its original intent, and therefore brittle, brittle, <i>brittle</i>.<p>The business consequences in specific instances were more than tangible. Six weeks for a refactoring here. Months added to timelines for new features there. Features actually abandoned. Millions in revenue lost.<p>There has been an uncanny relationship between these kinds of coders and a common theme of resistance to the following ideas: TDD, SOLID, Design Patterns. The same guys who leave a trail of maddening debt (all the faster because they also tended to be some of the smartest coders on the team), also tended to have a deep suspicion of ""high level"" thinking, frameworks, big-picture conventions. And always, always, the same old red herring, false dichotomy you present here: ""Do you want to <i>ship</i> code or <i>write elegant, well-tested code</i>?"" As if the two were opposed. As if the two weren't actually <i>directly related</i>.<p>Here's the thing: they had a point. The inverse errors -- over-architected, over-tested, over-thought code can be just as crazy-making. Some junior dev who just read Design Patterns in 2005 and thought they'd Seen the Light and starts spraying Bridge Patterns all over the codebase was just as bad as the aforementioned analytical, structured-code debt machines.<p>I can only go on what I know, and here's what I know: without exception every guy I've worked with that thought this way -- suspicious of TDD, plays ""shipping"" against ""tested/craftsmanship"" -- also created code that in the mid-to-long term cost the company far more money than they apparently saved by ""shipping fast"" and writing untested, unclear code.<p>The <i>most</i> frustrating thing to me about this is that, once you integrate these practices -- TDD, patterns, SOLID -- into your workflow, once you master them, they cost <i>nothing</i> in terms of time spent. You get practical about it, use it judiciously where it makes sense, don't use it where it's unnecessary and (like a lot of the Design Pattern stuffs) ignore it altogether. But you can only do this <i>if you can see both sides</i>, and you can only see both sides <i>if you've mastered the practices</i>. I spend much less time writing tested code than I would without it. I spend much less time managing well-designed codebases than I would thrashing around in a tangled mess.<p>It's like learning Vim enough to get proficient. You have to commit to it. Then you get pragmatic about it, learn its strengths and weaknesses and over time get to know the real benefits. But you have to have that willingness to commit to it up front and anticipate the benefits down the line.<p>And as an aside, in my 15 years, the great coders I've worked with (a few name-drop-worthy dudes in the mix) have, without exception, been committed to a pragmatic, healthy approach to TDD that was neither religious nor slow, and in fact made the entire team faster, the codebase more robust and the software far more shippable.<p>And while I have run into a lot of guys who have never written a single test - much less mastered TDD to the point of being able to speak intelligently about the pros and cons from a standpoint of <i>actual experience</i> - declare loudly and confidently that TDD is ""religious"" (""snake oil"" is another favorite) and ""feel free to ignore"", I have <i>never</i> run into an experienced coder who has integrated TDD into their workflow in a credible way, who actually <i>can</i> speak to both sides of the argument say the same thing.",1362584145

Rock solid and has millions of software written for it over the years (novadays ""apps"" all seem to be less than usefull). Throw in a virtual machine with linux and you can get the more esoteric development work done (it's otherwise also good to dev work on virtual machines, easy to have different environments for different projects).
The hardware is also superior to apple hardware in reliability. I've seen several failures with apple hardware (hdd problems mainly, other problems also). Apparently making the machines so purty is tough on the hardware (overheating etc), they apparently make compromises when it comes to looks/quality (eg. iPhone antenna fiasco).
But whatever, having the same boring apple laptop seems to be the ""cool"" thing to do (if you want to follow the masses, not very individualistic novadays to be an apple user :)
And the OS is also hard to use and gets in your way too much, flashing update and notification icons and unnecessary animations etc.

You can take the brightest minds in the world, give them billions of dollars, and they fail, while someone eating Ramen noodles, living in a basement succeeds. Try, and try again, because it's going to take a lot of failed attempts. Keep a fast turnover, and don't continue to pursue an idea that's not gaining traction.",1362582275

There is also the fact that the problem you guys are describing is not a problem at all to many people, like the guys who say this is easy.<p>I am one of those for whom ideas are not a problem at all. Nor is assessing other peoples ideas to quickly figure out which would likely have a market and which would not.<p>I've just added writing a blog post about this to my to-do list, hopefully I can come up with something good and help a whole lot of you improve upon this if it hits the front page. It's going to be really difficult though to put into words exactly how and why I can easily do this. I've never really thought about that - I just do it. It comes naturally.<p>I'm going to put a lot more thought to this, but one thing that comes quickly to mind:<p>Engineers are trained to think of all of the possible things which might go wrong and prevent those from happening. That's the exact opposite mindset of a productive idea bot. The idea bot thinks of all of the possible things that might go right and only thinks about what might go wrong later (often times pointing those things out to the idea bot is a major role of a good engineer). With experience and practice they'll be able to dismiss ideas faster because they know what can go wrong but they still have an optimistic approach and a very open mind to new ideas. Engineers can have a pessimistic approach and a somewhat closed mind about new ideas.<p>So what you need to do is learn to flip that switch in your brain. Once you start actually building something, think about what can go wrong. But when you're thinking of ideas, dismiss every negative thought that enters your mind and think positive. What could go right, how much could I make from this if all goes perfectly etc. Get yourself excited. Excitement about ideas breeds more ideas.",1362582191

The problem is not ""how hard the semantics are"", but ""how much of the semantics you need to support"", especially that interaction between them is a headache. Lua does not have the equivalent of where statement in JS (albeit most JIT compilers just don't optimize it) for example.<p>I won't argue about the JS (although DOM interaction comes to mind as a big headache), but in Python syntax is trivial. It's all the semantics and not just how they're, but how much of it. descriptors, metaclassses, new/old style classes, tons of builtin types, tons of builtin modules, <i>all</i> of it the user will expect to seamlessly integrate with the JIT compiler.",1362582188

If this was a free product, I'd be all for it. It would be <i>awesome</i> to see more free iOS native app templates.<p>But it's not free and that's an issue. Assuming this becomes successful, this will be the Bootstrap of iOS themes and half the apps out there will look identical. The brave ones will be a different color. I think Bootstrap is okay because it can be used as a stepping stone (or the basis for a more comprehensive (custom) design). I use it on a project when I have every intention of redesigning or having it redesigned later after the proof of concept is fleshed out.<p>People are not going to spend $130 on a theme and redesign it 6 months later. There will be no iteration or redesign because the fact that there is a price associated with this means it's ""good enough.""<p>You can get a skilled art student or brand new contractor to design a custom interface for 10x this or less. Hell, you can crowd source this on a site like 99designs for $600.<p>I'm all for making money and I hope the OP is successful. This looks well designed and I'm sure there is a market for it. That doesn't mean that it's the best option, or even a particularly good one, if you have the slightest bit of talent or money. And if you're really so broke that you're considering a $130 theme, I don't see why $600 for a <i>custom</i> theme that much worse. Wait two more months and save the extra money.

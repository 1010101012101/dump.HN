Didn&#x27;t the developers take on the most risk a year ago?

It will also make some of these engineers overpaid.  I don&#x27;t see how this benefits your company.  Yes, in this system some companies will be &quot;winners&quot; in the sense that they get an awesome team for a good price, but most will lose.  I would not be surprised if the high rate of failure in the startup community is related to this.<p>For the record, I do not see hiring the &quot;best available&quot; as settling unless they do not meet some minimum requirements of the business.  The purpose of hiring people is to help execute a product, service, or whatever else your business is trying to make money off of.  Anyone who can increase your chances of succeeding or increase your level of success is a good hire.  Yes, that includes looking at intangibles like team and culture fit, work ethic, etc.  But this person does not need to be the &quot;best&quot; to provide this boost to your business.

For example, the Mondragon corporation is a form of socialism<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_corporation</a><p>At the smaller scale; Intriguing stuff, but from reading this it sounds a whole lot like just another company with an interesting incentive scheme for employees and shareholders?  From reading through that it seems to be just another market participant rather than some top down re-organisation of the entire market system itself.<p>On the subject of revolutionary catalonia, it sure does sound more like what my initial perception of socialism really is, people being forcibly compelled to toe the communist party line with threats of death, ad et al. Against that backdrop I suppose it is unsurprising that the anarchists and communists were squabbling, and this is what I was aiming at with my initial criticism of socialism as a necessarily &quot;political&quot; entity rather than just another voluntary participant subject to the same market forces as all the other voluntary participants. And thus vulnerable to both poor market performance relative to the competition and also the negative externalities of being focused on politics rather than actual material results.<p>> workers run things rather than capitalists.<p>Doesn&#x27;t that once again reduce to &quot;workers control the means of production&quot; and then you&#x27;re left with workers councils figuring out what&#x27;s personal vs private property and all the political nonsense that goes along with that, munging the entire thing once again at scale into a necessarily authoritarian and political entity?",1376585710

Well yes, on a superficial level, I suppose democracy is kind of healthy in Japan. It sort of misses the point though.<p>Japanese Govt, like that in Singapore and South Korea, is characterised by the extreme strengths of their bureaucracies. It would be fair to say that the Japanese Diet, their government, is basically a peer to the JR railway company or MOFA. Imagine if in the USG, all the departments basically operated at the level of the DoD or Dept of State - frankly at the same level as congress. Congress can declare war on the DoD, sure, but would only do so under the most dire circumstances. In practise they cooperate.<p>Well, in Japan, that&#x27;s how it is. Basically, the government could probably, if it came down to it, fire the heads of the bureaucracies, but it won&#x27;t come to that and never has. They are peers for all practical purposes. They are like competing departments in a large corporation. You might think that is a recipe for wastefulness and corruption, and you would be absolutely right, but in a crazy sort of way they keep each other honest, somewhat, and it&#x27;s better than Fox News making all your decisions.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not some fanatical Japanophile - I don&#x27;t even live there anymore. But man, at least they can get at least some stuff done. In the west we could not even dream of having a 50-year high speed rail plan. Just think about that. What does that say about us? Look, we&#x27;re not a dystopia, but we&#x27;re still basically coasting on past success. The car is still moving, but it&#x27;s slowing down. Maybe we ran out of gas, or maybe we&#x27;re so caught up in fight about which way to drive we can&#x27;t even put our foot on the accelerator.<p>Corporations that lose the ability to invest in or even think about the long term go out of business. I don&#x27;t believe countries are any different. We are going to have to change, radically, or we&#x27;ll simply be taken over - it&#x27;s only a matter of time.",1376585316

This was in the believe that most countries had lists like this (Which they don&#x27;t) and i planned to add them as i went along. I got wiser and the first feedback i got also told me that the API should be able to do probabilistic guesses and if possible, also offer some sort of localization filter to achieve more accurate guesses.\nI decided to take an approach of using large, growing datasets of user profiles from social networks. Each entry containing a first name, a gender, a country_id and language_id. At last, i exposed this datamodel through http://genderize.io\nIt responds in JSON. Simple example: http://api.genderize.io?name=robin\nI am now looking to get some feedback on my new approach. What do you think of this way of doing guesses. What do you think of the API?

Normal explosives will also tend to degrade slowly over time as the chemical reactions that power their explosion also have a &quot;activation barrier that prevents this happening readily&quot;.  But as the temperature increases probability that any given molecular interaction will exceed that activation barrier increases.  And if the activation barrier is exceeded, a chemical reaction happens that will release energy and increase the local temperature.  In some substances if you increase the local temperature by enough there will be a runaway reaction which will quickly liberate all of the available chemical energy, an explosion.  This all has to be triggered, but the strength of the substance makes me think that the energy involved in breaking it ought to be enough.<p>Now, it might be that the energy required to get over the potential barrier is large enough compared to the energy released by the reaction that this doesn&#x27;t happen.  If there people with real chemistry experience here instead of just semiconductor physics and basic statistical mechanics I&#x27;d be grateful if they&#x27;d speak up.

6218953,comment,6217120,6218632,1,0,DanBC,,,"> Seems odd for someone who gets intensely bitter over someone making a successful business to hang around on HN.<p>Plenty of people on HN dislike scams.  Soylent is marketed in a dishonest, scammy, way.<p>First, the minor dishonesties:<p>> <i>Suppose we had a default meal that was the nutritional equivalent of water: cheap, healthy, convenient and ubiquitous.</i><p>Soylent tries to say it&#x27;s something new; that this product doesn&#x27;t exist.  That&#x27;s just not true.<p>> <i>Soylent will be personalized for different body types and customizable based on individual goals.</i><p>This is the most interesting part of the Soylent claim.  If they could make access to testing easier and cheaper they&#x27;d have a useful product.<p>> <i>For anyone who struggles with allergies, heartburn, acid reflux or digestion, has trouble controlling weight or cholesterol, or simply doesn&#x27;t have the means to eat well, soylent is for you.</i><p>They had to change the main source of protein because many people are lactose intolerant. Despite the disclaimer later on in the page this paragraph is making clear medical claims.  They have no evidence to support those claims.  They also have no need to make those claims!  People would have bought Soylent if those claims were not there.<p>> <i>Soylent [...] puts you in excellent health,<p>Another dubious unsubstantiated medical claim.<p>> </i>and vastly reduces your environmental impact by eliminating much of the waste and harm coming from agriculture, livestock, and food-related trash.*<p>This is an important point.  But, like most of the Soylent stuff, they make the claim but have no evidence to support it.  I can&#x27;t find any kind of ecological assessment on any of the various Soylent blogs and websites.<p>> <i>50% of the food produced globally is wasted, and food makes for the largest component of municipal garbage. If not for this waste there would be plenty of food to adequately nourish everyone alive.</i><p>Food waste is not the reason for global malnutrition.<p>> <i>1 in 7 people globally are malnourished, and 1 in 3 in the developing world suffer from deficiency. Countless others are living hand-to-mouth, subsistence farming, hindering economic development. Even in the developed world, agriculture is the most dangerous industry to work in by occupational injuries and illnesses, and obesity is on the rise.</i><p>This is laughably ignorant.  i) Soylent is very expensive when compared to the existing FRPs and FSPs used by WFP and UNICEF. (20% of the world lives on less than $1.25 per day) ii) Soylent needs clean water.  About one billion people don&#x27;t have access to clean water. Soylent make no mention of this, even though water is a crucial ingredient of the product. iii) Soylent appears to do nothing to increase local independence and resilience.  How does Soylent help local farmers?<p>> By taking years to spoil,<p>I really need to see how they&#x27;ve tested that. I can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s true.  Especially in the context of food aid, where ideal storage conditions may not be available.  Perhaps they mean &quot;sealed packs last six months in less-than-ideal conditions&quot; - that&#x27;s a fine claim to make (if true), they don&#x27;t need the untested exaggeration.<p>> dramatically reducing cost, and easing transportation and storage, soylent could have a dramatic effect on hunger and malnutrition.<p>Soylent is considerably more expensive than the products being used by WFP and UNICEF.  I guess transportation and storage are similar.<p>> <i>Proceeds from the purchase of soylent enable us to work with aid partners and reduce hunger and environmental impact both in the United States and the developing world.</i><p>This is great.  I wish more companies would do it.  Soylent don&#x27;t mention who they&#x27;re going to be working with.  I&#x27;d have thought that with the $800,000 they&#x27;ve raised they would have made a few initial donations.  Perhaps they&#x27;re researching who to give some money to?   WaterAid would be one  choice.  WFP would be another.<p>> <i>Imagine everyone having a customized,</i><p>So far, two options.  i) Male.  ii) Female.  It&#x27;s a great idea - what do they mean by it?  Do they know what they mean?<p>Then there are a bunch of user testimonials and quotes from the press.<p>They actually do a reasonable job of the risks and challenges section, better than many other crowd-funders do.  They don&#x27;t mention the risk of people becoming ill after using Soylent.<p>> <i>there is much evidence that is considerably healthier than a typical diet.</i><p>They don&#x27;t define a typical diet.  There is not any evidence that Soylent is considerably healthier than any diet, because there&#x27;s no evidence for Soylent at all yet.",1376584353

6218893,comment,6218354,6218519,3,0,peterwwillis,,,"You need insight into how these kind of sites are run to understand how attacks typically work on them.<p>Backend: lots of technology feeding them content and sending their content out other places. App servers, content sinks, message buses, databases, FTP&#x27;d stories, etc etc. Nobody ever attacks these because you have to have some kind of basic reconnaissance on what they do and how they do it. And they&#x27;re not very secure because of the low visibility. But if you do know how most news sites get their content, there&#x27;s some fun holes to play with.<p>Frontend: SQL injection, misconfigured services, bad firewalls, shared or easily-guessed accounts. You don&#x27;t need anything fancy most of the time. There is no Security Czar making sure everything is secure on the frontend. There&#x27;s supposed to be, but their lack of authority or motivation prevents them from really trying to secure everything in a big-picture way.<p>Development: The site is constantly being developed, and not always by the same staff. Sometimes a new guy who writes really shitty code will push something to production which is clearly hazardous to security. It gets through code review and policies and procedures because everyone&#x27;s busy trying to get real work done. Often these holes go unnoticed for years.<p>Third-party content: There is nothing ensuring content you&#x27;re getting from a 3rd party is what you expect it to be. If it&#x27;s not being served by your servers, it&#x27;s subject to attack. Often sites get taken down not because of attack, but because an ad network is timing out, causing  the page to stop being loaded, effectively DoSing the page. SLAs mitigate this to a small extent by encouraging the 3rd party not to lose money to their customers by being hacked.<p>Phishing: This will work 90% of the time. Professional pen-testers have agreements not to phish or social engineer their targets more than a certain amount, because it almost always works; there&#x27;s not much need to test it. But keep in mind that if this were Syrians, their lack of mastery of English could present a problem. Maybe it&#x27;d only work 60% of the time in this case.<p><i>&quot;I just feel like these sites should be getting scanned daily&quot;</i>: Nope. The vast majority of sites don&#x27;t get constantly hammered by attackers looking for a way in, because 99% of the attacks seen on large-traffic sites are trivial automated things like botnets, which try one or two common holes across millions of sites. Even the most basic security measures prevent these.<p>Real, targeted attacks are rare, and often get lost in the noise of constant botnet barrage. There just aren&#x27;t a whole lot of SEA&#x27;s out there trying to take over every single website. Usually when they do try, they succeed, in some fashion or another; if they were to do this to every popular website on the internet, it would take them months or years to get around to it all. And they probably have day jobs.<p>The very last attack that works is a 0-day. It&#x27;s called a 0-day because (typically) it is patched a day or two after it&#x27;s announced, and they are rare. If you have one, you don&#x27;t use it just to attack one news site.",1376583981

It would be a waste of time to just spin definitions in a way that makes us inherently right about whatever it is we&#x27;re talking about without reference to a common agreed set of terms.<p>When advocates for free markets or anarcho capitalists are talking about capitalism, they most decidedly <i>are</i> talking precisely about free trade. I am not sure where you&#x27;re getting this other definition of capitalism that only exists as a subset of the westphalian nation state, that sounds a lot more like corporatism to me, where limited liability shells are set up with explicit protectionist policies and almost purchased legal protections supporting their manufactured business models from a nation state.<p>Just to be clear where are you getting this definition of capitalism as a creation of the state and something that cannot exist without it, completely divorced from the free market? How would you describe markets which exist outside the control and sanction of the state and without any participatory enforcement by the state, frequently enough actually even actively opposed by the state? The &quot;means of production&quot; and the control of that means is not necessarily within the hands of &quot;the workers&quot; in the marxist sense in those situations, so how is this not a direct example of capitalism without the state?<p>My description does not attempt to hide the authority, the seller is responsible for their security as is the buyer, they are both free to make whatever arrangements they choose with whatever other parties they choose in order to ensure the security of those products. Vendors might buy security cameras or other theft and violence deterrents. Buyers might buy insurance against defects or also be customers of third party organisations which have a vested interest in being trustworthy sources of information about the quality of products available at vendors a-z, and so on, and so forth. It is absolutely not implicitly necessary that security for both parties be provided by a nation state or its legislative, judicial and executive branches.<p>If socialist criticisms of capitalism entirely rely upon classifying capitalism as a sub branch of the nation state, it seems an awfully big hole to not acknowledge that trade and markets can exist entirely divorced from nation states?<p>Further on the subject of socialism; I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s actually possible for socialism to exist without states? Having a centralised body which exercises violent authority to which all parties must submit and participate in is pretty much the definition of a state, How can socialists criticise free market approaches for defacto use of state enforcement mechanisms because they are what is available rather than the only way free market participants may enforce their terms and conditions when the very nature of socialism is to rely on that exact same state but in a more direct way and with no alternative mechanism for enforcement at all? A political entity which dispenses edicts amongst a population which is entirely free to ignore them is little more than a church, of what consequence is a socialist platform without a monopoly on force to compel adherence to the edicts and forcibly finance the policies of the political entity through taxation?",1376583932

In your main loop, send a * Point down the channel.  That basically means:  I made this thing.  It&#x27;s yours now.  Do what you want with it.

You almost certainly shouldn&#x27;t be doing this; I&#x27;m just doing this to emulate the fact that the original example is using the same reference from both threads.  Yes, this is very, very weird and no, you should not do this in your own programs.  Anyway, we take that pointer back, dereference it, and assign it to a <i>new</i> Point value, which is completely weird and I still don&#x27;t understand.  (presumably the original author mistakenly thought this was an atomic way to set both fields on the Point.)  In this way, the two goroutines (the main and reporting goroutine) are able to use channels to synchronize access to some shared memory.<p>This is a pretty silly use of concurrency, though, because in this case, it&#x27;s probably more clear to just use a mutex to lock and unlock your Point.

I remember that when I was a kid, it was a <i>huge</i> thing when a man mistook a woman for a man or, much worse, a man for a woman.  If a man mistook a long-haired man for a woman, even from a hundred feet away, he would be the subject of derision from his friends, and he would be panicked and furious.  The mistake would be blamed on the questionable sexuality of one or both parties.  From where I&#x27;m sitting it looks like there&#x27;s been a massive cultural shift in that regard, and I don&#x27;t think anybody will be playing CoD filled with homophobic terror at the thought of mistaking a character&#x27;s sex.  It might have been a concern for game designers in the past.<p>Besides sexism on the part of the game designers, there&#x27;s also the fact that the U.S. armed forces very recently decided to officially allow women into combat roles.

While the mind of a designer might be that of problem solving and loving their craft, you invariably can&#x27;t solve the problem for the client without some coding.<p>It&#x27;s far easier to be a developer and code the solution then it is to be a designer and purely design it aesthetically.

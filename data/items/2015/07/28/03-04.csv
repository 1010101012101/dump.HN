Final approach is either from the north, south, or a western heading over Jersey City to Runway 29, still south and slightly west of Weehawken. A tunnel looking east would see skyscrapers in Manhattan. <i>Possibly</i> air traffic from Laguardia, but it&#x27;s unlikely, especially with pump infrastructure in the way.<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>> To reduce drag on the burritos to a minimum, the tunnel must be kept in near-vacuum with powerful pumps.<p>Yet a few paragraphs later, they say &quot;Mail would frequently arrive singed or deformed from the intense heat and pressure.&quot; What is it? Vacuum or pressure?<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>> Furthermore, advances in electrical engineering meant that containers would no longer have to be propelled by compressed gas. The burritos already came conveniently wrapped in aluminum foil - it would be trivial to accelerate them with powerful magnets.<p>The power required by these magnets to induce the Lenz effect in a burrito wrapper, let alone propel it, is too high for large-scale applications.<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>> Under our feet are five miles of silt from the Rockies before you even get to the first rock.<p>Not even close to true. Tecumseh Shale, for example, can be found about 100 feet deep in places.<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>> At the tunnel exit, a final puff of air slows the burritos to a stop and they are placed in insulated bags. These are whisked to a fleet of waiting trucks, which pass through the Holland Tunnel (this time at a more stately thirty-five miles per hour) and then onward to restaurants and cafeterias throughout the five boroughs.<p>Why not the Lincoln Tunnel? It&#x27;s actually in Weehawken! The traffic through Hoboken and Jersey City to the Holland is insane. Why didn&#x27;t they just build the tunnel to Manhattan? It&#x27;s a mile away!",1438055847

Torture is ineffective: the intelligence you get is very likely to either confirm (incorrect) biases you already have, and failing that to lead you to new and incorrect wrong conclusions. Even if the fate of the world depended on it, resorting to torture is - at best - a gamble with very long odds. Aside from the ethical concerns, the main issue with torture from an intelligence perspective is that it usually makes the problem worse. It makes you stupider, not smarter (assuming you are actually doing torture to obtain real, actionable intelligence).<p>But what if it were effective? What if doing torture on a single individual was provably likely to make you 10% more effective at your job, and your job at the moment happens to involve trying to save a million lives? Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I fucking <i>hated</i> 24 for the way it glamorized torture - it would be disgusting for doing that even if torture were effective. But <i>if torture were effective</i> it seems like you could build some utilitarian calculus around when to use it, and that sometimes it would be a good idea to do it.",1438055692

If you purposely inject 10 bugs (don&#x27;t forget to remove them! :) and QA or fuzzing finds 7 of them plus (say) 42 other bugs, then you can extrapolate that you have about 18 undiscovered bugs (10/7*42-42 = 18).

I&#x27;m not sure I understand the estimates of computational power of various brain parts (does that even make sense?) but overall I think the author has the right idea on how far we are away from simulating the brain.<p>Not only does planet Earth train trillions of neural nets in parallel, but it&#x27;s running a very elegant evolutionary algorithm for hyperparameter selection among all possible units.<p>Some interesting (and somewhat depressing) tidbits of neuroscience that further corroborate the futility of full brain simulation:<p>- Collision avoidance in locusts is entirely implemented in a single neuron [1]. All the computation is performed by the complex nonlinear integration of action potentials across the dendritic tree. The geometry of the dendritic tree is really important.\n- Neurons with mechanosensory receptors can actually fire in response the dilation of a blood vessel pressing up against it [2]. The vascular system innervates throughout the brain like a secondary connectome, and is implicated in information processing as well. Good luck simulating blood flow in 400 miles of elastic tubing.<p>- Every voltage-gated channel or patch of cellular membrane basically acts as a leaky integrator, and digital systems are pretty bad at this kind of operation. Analog circuits/neuromorphics are useful for this (as well as the asynchronous dynamics) but good luck fabricating a chip that operates in 3D and integrates an arbitrary nonlinear equation.<p>- Simulations often involve injecting random stimulus into the network, or showing it images through some approximation of the retinal ganglion cells + V1 cortex. However, the brain has evolved to operate in a closed sensorimotor loop, so the brain&#x27;s activity ought to influence subsequent perception (and brain state). The inputs one feed in through the eyeballs and thalamus play a large role in the dynamical state. This is one of the main arguments for embodied cognition approaches.<p>Not all is hopeless, though:\n- I think neuroscience / deep learning models complement each other well. The success of techniques like dropout-based regularization and ReLU in practical AI tasks have prompted neuroscientists to actively look for how biology solves rectification and un-learning.<p>- If they can get their act together and fire their middle management, I could see Cisco making a huge contribution to deep learning by building faster switches. Nvidia has done a good job with pushing GPU Flops, and the bottleneck right now is on the network side.<p>- DNNs and other data-driven generative models are really cool because they &quot;replay&quot; the human condition back to us. Images generated by DeepDream have surprising amounts of &quot;ordered randomness&quot; in comparison to fractal-based images. Perhaps instead of trying to build this generative process from inside-out (i.e. from neurons to minds), it might be interesting to see what happens if we train a DNN to mimic human behavior, and see what internal states self-organize as a result. The film &quot;Ex Machina&quot; mentions Jackson Pollock and the use of Search Engine Data to capture <i>how</i> people think, which I thought was brilliant.<p>Citations:\n[1] <a href=""http://www.frontiersin.org/10.3389/conf.fphys.2013.25.00090/event_abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frontiersin.org/10.3389/conf.fphys.2013.25.00090/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17913979"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17913979</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jgd1000/metaphors.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jgd1000/metaphors.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/04/02/surprise-babies-learning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/04/02/surprise-babies-learning</a>",1438052863

US society need a major reform. Our culture and community need major reforms. The way boys and girls are raised need to be changed, the way they are educated and develop social skills and people skills need to change as well.<p>As it is Corporate America and the Tech industry has developed a certain mindset based on the power elite of Silicon Valley that controls VC and who gets on the board of directors via shareholders. Everyone has to work 80+ hours a week, and it is hostile to trying to raise a family. Corporations favor the worker who is single over one that is married and has children. They don&#x27;t like it when there is responsibilities other than work that an employees has. Which is why there is no good maternity leave, or even child care services. Heck in most cases you have to drop your religion and become non-practicing so you don&#x27;t attend services so you can work more hours.<p>When I was a young boy in the 1970s it was different, people got the weekends off and spent it with the family with family picnics and they only worked 40+ hours a week, and took off for family matters. The 1980s and 1990s changed that and the Dotcom Boom made the Startups and marathon coding that required more time per week to work. People got less sleep, worked more hours, gave up relationships and family, and put everything into working a job.<p>For me it got so stressful that in June 2001 I developed a mental illness from all of the stress I was under and all of the extra hours I worked. I took time off to pick up my son from a babysitter because child care was not offered and my wife worked a different shift, and I got made fun of because I was taking care of my son instead of my wife. I ended up on short term disability and when I returned I was fired for being sick. You see once you become mentally ill they don&#x27;t want you, even if you were hurt in the line of duty. Which is why so many mentally ill people hide their illnesses and go untreated and then do a suicide later on. I ended up on disability in 2003.<p>I never made it back to work. But I know of all of the problems in the industry and can talk about them freely without worrying that I&#x27;ll be fired for talking about them.<p>In order to make up diversity, many tech companies use the H1B Visa program to hire people from India because they are not white males and because they will work for less money. Being from India gives them a more diverse work force, and they are disposable employees. If they don&#x27;t do what they are told, the Visa is canceled and they go back to their native country.

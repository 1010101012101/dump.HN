Which is pretty scary, if you ask me.<p>I've meant for quite some time to write an article about the fragility of human technological innovation.<p>Here are some examples that I can think of:<p>- I think I read about this case in a computer magazine: when the personal computers just started to be available they scanned and recorded in the digital form some ancient holy book so that it will be better preserved in digital form from then on. The year was 1982 maybe, the computer platform was not the one that would become mainstream and the recording media was some kind of digital laserdisc I think. The irony is, some 20 years later they had a really big trouble finding the computer to read the data back. (this is from my memory, can't find the source)<p>- Web platform once considered cutting edge (Macromedia/Adobe Shockwave), cannot run on modern operating systems (Linux) 15 years later. No replacement or emulation solution in sight; users depending on it are left in the cold.<p>- Geocities was shut down on short notice, with no exit strategy for its users 10 years after being bought for $3.5 billion<p>- Belt-clippable, battery-operated mp3 players like iRiver T10 (an achievement of its own, if you ask me) are nowhere to be found 5 years after they appeared (appeared ~2003, obsolete in 2008)",1269305569

Do you disagree with that notion?</i><p>I don't disagree with that. I just feel that you are putting too much emphasis on 'monetization' when you're trying to get that point across. 'Monetization' is a completely different skill set from software development. The product doesn't attract users all on its own. You have to market it, and marketing is <i>not</i> a software development skill.<p>Creating a profitable side business around a product that you created is impressive, but not everyone can do it because it requires an individual that has a number of skills that don't fall under 'software developer.' Acting like only the people that can create a product, market it and manage the finances surrounding it (as well as make tough business decisions, etc) are the only people worth looking at as developers is a little over-the-top.<p>> <i>I'm perplexed and somewhat disturbed by what I interpret as an assertion that creating a successful product indicates a lack of software development skills. Am I misunderstanding you?</i><p>You are. Creating a successful product requires <i>more</i> than just software development skills. In fact, it only implies a base level of software development skills. You cannot use it to deduce the actual level of a person's software development skills, only that they have a minimum level. It's possible for someone to be a super-skilled developer, but have mediocre marketing/business skills. If the job only calls for development skills, why should that person be discounted for a lack of skills not related to the job?",1269304779

1211809,comment,1211146,1211591,0,0,sonnym,,,"There are a few misconceptions about Carlsen in your comment.<p>The most obvious is that he is not the World Chess Champion, but world #1 - the difference being that you have to defeat the previous champion in an extended match in order to claim the title.<p>Second, both Carlsen and Kasparov think that Carlsen is stronger and weaker than Kasparov in certain areas.  What they have mentioned to the public before is that Carlsen has a better intuitive sense of a position, while Kasparov has greater facilities of calculation.  What they both agree on, it seems, is that Carlsen, in large part due to the aid of computers, has reached such a high level of ascendancy in chess at a significantly younger age than Kasparov was able.<p>Finally, as he plainly states in the article, Carlsen is trying not to be crazy, by living as normal a life as he can and not becoming obsessed with the game to an unhealthy degree.<p>Aside in relation to a response to your post, since I don't feel like posting twice:  It is insanely difficult, if not impossible, to say that Carlsen would beat Kasparov - especially now that Carlsen has been using Kasparov's advise on openings against other opponents, we observers cannot tell what recent innovations have, in fact, been his original work and not that of Kasparov.  Another point to consider is that, even with the amount of rating inflation there has been over the past several years, Carlsen's 2813 rating does not come close to Kasparov's maximum of 2851.  Finally, Kasparov was uncontested at the top for nearly two decades, whereas Carlsen is still having troubles overcoming some other top grandmasters (specifically Kramnik of late).  Unilaterally saying that Carlsen would be Kasparov in a match is, realistically, a rather uninformed opinion.",1269304069

Why?

I've worked for three small businesses in the last ten years. All of them offered significantly better health insurance plans than the large companies I've worked for. The largest of those small businesses had just five employees. The last company I worked for ended up dropping their insurance plan, but that was a desperate cost cutting measure on the way towards bankruptcy. It seems that similar businesses in California (I'm in Nevada) don't offer health insurance due to the cost. My wifes insurance currently covers my wife and son. It's prohibitively expensive to add dependents to the plan and it's actually worse than the plan I had previously. Her employer has around 3k employees.<p>I keep seeing mixed arguments about the exchange. There doesn't seem to be any conclusive evidence that it is actually going to make health insurance more affordable for small businesses.

How do I get to work in your world? :-)<p>IME, for regular employees, the difference in pay between a respectable senior developer, technical lead or project architect and a junior developer straight out of university is perhaps a factor of 3-4x. Unless you go into management and rise to a senior level, it pretty much plateaus after that in most places.<p>On the other hand, the difference in productivity between the same types of people can be a lot more than 3-4x. By the time you factor in the improved communications and general reduction in overheads from having a smaller team of individually more productive people, top people are easily worth a disproportionate amount, if only you can find them and convince them to work for your company instead of someone else's (including their own).",1269303049

Few seem to have any particularly insightful or interesting interface ideas either.

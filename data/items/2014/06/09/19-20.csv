7870135,comment,7869771,7869771,9,0,timtadh,,,"I am working on an x86 code generator today for a small language I have been working on. This story seems very timely to re-read because it is so difficult to generate really good x86 code. Even though I basically know what I am doing when writing a code generator at this point, and I have previous ones to reference, there are so many edge cases it is hard to get it right.[1]<p>It used to be said that a compiler would never beat a programmer at assembly. Now we say the compiler is usually going to &quot;do the right thing.&quot; I think there are two things going on here: 1) Our code generators are much better than they were in the bad old days. 2) Most people don&#x27;t understand the ins and outs of their machines like Mel did (I certainly don&#x27;t). This means that the compiler has &quot;institutional&quot; knowledge from a few really knowledgeable people and the rest of us just use that knowledge.<p>[1] see for simple example `imul` which has 5 different forms <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-3773/instructionset-39/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-3773/instructionset-...</a> . According to the intel optimization manual[2] the 16 bit forms suffer from &quot;false LCP&quot; stalls. The recommendation is to cast to 32 bit before preforming the `imul`.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/...</a> page 103 in the PDF.

This is because in  Haskell the type signature of a function gives an upper bound of what the function does. In an impure language, a function may change any accessible mutable values and/or perform IO. These possible side effects mean that in an impure language the type of a function is a very weak indicator of what the function actually does.",1402343663

7870127,comment,7869644,7869840,7,0,sqrt17,,,"There is a slight difference between name-calling and oppression. Oppression can only be done from a position of power, and it stabilizes the power of the oppressing. Namecalling can be done by any person who wants to do it, because it does not presuppose or enforce any kind of power relation.<p>Pure namecalling can be differentiated from libel/slander (saying things that are discreditable), abuse of employees (which presupposes and enforces an extant power relation) or  ethnic or sexual discrimination (where the offender encourages the public to discredit a whole group of people).<p>Claiming that all men are potential rapists would be both slanderous and discriminatory. Calling someone a cunt or a dick on the internet is a public display of immaturity, whichever the sex of the calling and/or of the callee. Insinuating that such namecalling is slanderous is ridiculous, and the claim that it&#x27;s sexual discrimination doesn&#x27;t ring true to me. Obviously repeated and insistent immature behaviour towards someone would constitute harassment, but we&#x27;re not talking of that either - we&#x27;re talking of someone writing a tweet and then deleting it shortly after.<p>It&#x27;s also outside of the sphere where working conditions within a company are affected - someone writing and then deleting a tweet is hardly having a lasting influence. Which means that it&#x27;s not within the obvious interest of an employer to maintain good working conditions.<p>What role is the employer then fulfilling? It is an agent for the privilege of female outrage, a modern &quot;lese majeste&quot; that, through the construction of women as an oppressed minority (spoiler: they&#x27;re not a minority and more of those that speak out are annoyed than oppressed), allows an ill-meaning person to terrorize people without fear of reprisal.<p>You&#x27;re also using a different definition of agency: the author uses agency as a term for responsible action by the person (her|him)self, whereas you include people acting on your behalf. The idea of female hypoagency is exactly that women have less of the former and more of the latter than men do, and a widespread criticism of (a particular variety of) feminism is that it reinforces female hypoagency while outwardly claiming a goal of achieving equality. To which the proponents of that particular variety of feminism reply that females need to be more equal than the others, because they   are an underprivileged group.",1402343561

7870100,comment,7869644,7869920,3,0,scarmig,,,"For that particular tweet: this is what we call trolling. Shanley&#x27;s MVC (which is a very interesting site that everyone should read, its proprietor notwithstanding) has a &quot;feature&quot; where they highlight the worst and most clueless comment on HN of the month. This entire imbroglio has doubtlessly netted MVC a very rich upcoming &quot;worst of HN&quot; piece. Joy.<p>Substantively: why should the previous behavior of the reporter matter one bit? If someone does something bad, whether a person complaining about it is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;  is sort of besides the point, and digging into how evil that person is amounts to an all-too-transparent attempt at deflection. Shanley, for better or for worse, takes advantage of that to generate news. That means that even if you get provoked, external observers won&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t care enough to get caught up in whether Shanley&#x27;s a bad person or not. (Your takeaway, by the way, should be &quot;do not engage&quot; because she&#x27;s communicating with an audience that&#x27;s not-you when she engages with you. Also: all comments on this story amount to engagement, hence the heavy flagging.)<p>My sympathy for the fired guy is very limited. He clearly fucked up, and immediately knew it and took it down (before she even posted her screenshot, it seems), either because a friend told him he was out of line or he realized it himself. Which does elicit a bit of sympathy from me, and if I were in her shoes, I&#x27;d have let it slide--there&#x27;s more than enough misogyny in tech than to need to scrape the bottom of the barrel here. Despite that, he did fuck up. Freedom of speech is not an issue: if he had posted a long stream of tweets calling for Jews to be slaughtered, no one would be upset that his company let him go. She has just as much freedom-to-report-speech as he has freedom-to-insult-speech, and freedom of association is an equally important right.",1402343207

You&#x27;re waffling and trying to make this discussion about me. You initially demanded scientific evidence of harm caused by GMOs. The clear implication is that without scientific proof of harm, concerns are not credible. The natural corollary is that they should be considered safe.<p>The point I made is simple: we cannot assume safety simply because we have yet to find evidence otherwise. This is what you (and others) are doing when, as a tactic for dismissing concerns, you repeatedly demand scientific proof of harm.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why that statement is controversial, but yours is the same approach that pharmaceutical, tobacco, chemical (etc.) companies have employed over decades. Under this model, they merely need to demand evidence, then point to some doubt in findings of harm in order to continue touting their wares as safe. The burden of proof is on the claimant and, worse, even reams of empirical evidence are frequently insufficient for this purpose. Look how long tobacco companies were able to fight in spite of mountains of evidence against their product.<p>If you want to ignore decades of history and pretend to actually believe that companies with a vested interest in denying harm do not do so, then feel free. But, at a minimum, you should not express bewilderment that right-thinking people respect the scale of what&#x27;s at stake, have the temerity to express doubt, possess the common sense to consider their observations, and ask questions.",1402342719

Their architecture is even farther out from being supported.  They have the drawback that they can neither receive blood from &quot;O&quot; nor give to &quot;AB&quot; if you&#x27;ll indulge the analogy of images to blood types, they have one of those weird blood types that doesn&#x27;t even register in the statistics with a reasonably sized sample.  Anemic, maybe.<p>If you had a jails execution driver, you certainly don&#x27;t have to use Linux processes or binary emulation, you can build your containers with a BSD base and BSD toolchain.  The point is that in theory, you probably could skip that step and get working with existing binary images built from Linux distributions.<p>It would quickly be a better &quot;alternative platform&quot; than any  of the other existing contenders (different architectures) who you could already see in the docker ecosystem at this point; it could probably run many existing container images out of the box, on a FreeBSD host with amd64 architecture.<p>The contained software really shouldn&#x27;t care what execution driver keeps it isolated, at least in theory.  In practice someone with more knowledge than me can probably say what a bad idea this is, maybe because either &quot;congrats, you just invented Virtualization&quot; or &quot;wrong, jails won&#x27;t keep those processes separated.&quot;",1402342463

Information about \n  venders and their products will be available to any \n  computer connected to the highway. Servers distributed \n  worldwide will accept bids, resolve offers into completed \n  transactions, control authentication and security, and \n  handle all other aspects of the marketplace, including \n  the transfer of funds.

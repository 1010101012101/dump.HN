1680458,comment,1679926,1679926,0,0,squanderingtime,,,"While I generally agree that the OpenSSL library is somewhat horrendous, this specific use-case addresses a very tiny subset of what the library does internally to do some real magic.<p>I used to work for a very large public facing certificate authority and there was a period in which one of the public CA systems used OpenSSL, so we had to be able to call several of the signing functions via a JNI extension.  Why?  Because OpenSSL has fairly remarkable support fir internal context objects that allow you to designate PKCS#11-interfaced hardware security modules for private key operations.<p>Yes, the levels of indirection are painful to read through and when you get down to the levels where you can actually do a signing operation you have multi-level points (<i></i>something) of strange types, but it works almost magically when you need it to.<p>It's also the combined with the intersection of handling/reading certificates.  The IO interface has to correctly handle PEM and DER information.  Even if you can parse those structures all you're left with is ASN.1 annotated structures and ASN.1 is an exercise in pain.<p>So a library that can read a broad format of single-bit sensitive data, correctly decode and preserve the structure of ASN.1 entries, perform crypto operations, and then somehow make sense of it all across how many years is mostly likely going to be complicated as hell.  Or at the very least, given my proficiency with C I think I would have a hard time coming up with a library that worked on as many platforms as transparently for as many years.",1284159039

1680455,comment,1678741,1678741,0,0,sbowles,,,"I think this is a dangerous assertion, and I say this as someone who didn’t finish college and did pretty well financially in the end (alas no successful exits, only market-rate Bay Area startup wages). Only the super motivated, talented, brass-balled or well connected can manage the upstream push against the pervasive social perception - outside of tech centers - you’re second rate if you didn’t finish college.<p>I think the American education system is broken for a sizeable percentage of kids, from low-quality grade schools all the way through to the outrageous cost of college. For most poor or middle class kids who aren’t in tech, currently they need the exposure to college and they need some additional skills training if they’re to have any hope of getting a decent job after high school. Unfortunately, the esoteric, academic, over-priced world of universities have been turned into the required stepping stone for employment when it is only minimally relevant in many employment sectors. It would be more productive to reinvigorate market-based apprentice programs, revamp junior colleges and redirect some state/federal post secondary education funding to the employee job training credit to truly incentivize employers to take on more entry level employees. Less kids with less debt is a good thing, but they still need skills to be employable. I think it is easy for those of us who are self-directed learners to forget about our peers who really do need training and coaching to succeed.<p>Like many on this board, learning to code was my meal ticket for years and it is the work world safe haven for those who drop out of/never go to college. I got grilled a lot more about why I didn’t finish college once I moved into code-free jobs. There are millions of university graduates who are unemployed right now. It takes a certain degree of arrogance to pitch your degree-free self as a better candidate than your degreed competitors. I’d never be so smug and delusional about the specificity of my degree-free  success to pitch foregoing college in the present economic environment to someone just out of high school. Even when it worked for me.",1284158967

Most HTTP configs I've seen use virtual hosts, which means that the correct Host header is the only way to get the server to send the request to the right site.<p>(When dealing with SSL, then things are different, because you can't authenticate the connection until you get the cert, you can't send data until the connection is authenticated, and the server can't give you the right cert until it gets the Host.  Fundamental conflict, leading to one-IP-per-domain-name, or a pricey wildcard certificate.  So in that case, the server doesn't care much about Host anymore, but you are still protected because the domain name that the browser sees has to match the one in the cert, or the browser gives you the OH NOES dialog.

1680436,comment,1673130,1678118,0,0,sx,,,"A point with which I strongly disagree is that some public businesses are profitable so we should leave them alone. First of all, it's trivial to be profitable if you control a monopoly. Also, being profitable doesn't mean you are efficient, some things could be done much more effectively in the private sector. Also, by being overstaffed, even if profitable, you are not allowing all these people working for you to do something more productive.<p>Beyond that, when talking about profitability, you should consider pension plans and future obligations. Some of these businesses might have a positive balance sheet for the year but what's going to happen if you consider their future, inflated, obligations. A good example are the pensions the Public Electric Company employees get. They are mostly funded by the government.<p>Let's see why it screws up incentives:
-- What do you think any of the people working in the public sector tries to optimize? Is it the successe of the business they are working on? Do they try to advance their careers? Or do they try to work as little as possible?
-- If an employee is not good, is a government controlled company ever going to fire them?
-- The guy who controls the supplies in the hospitals, does he ever have to report to somebody about that?
-- Do you know a single person in the public sector that he has ever been promoted or fired because of his skills or lack there of?",1284158531

1680351,comment,1678741,1678741,0,0,ryanlchan,,,"I'm sick and tired of people putting arbitrary dollar valuations on abstract things. College is not a financial investment. You can not only look at your debt and your income to make this decision. It might make for a good, sensational news article, but it's almost immoral how backwards this viewpoint is.<p>The real value in college, like just about any other pursuit, is network building. Like several commenters have said, if all you wanted out of school was to learn something, you could go to the library. The fees for college are for the intangible aspects, and are worth far more than a direct dollars-to-dollars comparison will show.<p>Think of college as an IDE for personal development. It sets up a ready-made environment for you to explore new relationships, indulge in a variety of pursuits, and learn about the world. There are thousands of other people using the same IDE, creating a lively place for discussion of issues you'd never otherwise think of. People introduce you to new features or mechanics which you never considered before; you naturally begin to collaborate and contribute to large scale projects. You might even lead a few. Could you get all of these experience by piecing different activities together? Of course. Would it be nearly as productive, successful, and transformational? Of course not.<p>Like an IDE though, sometimes college can get a little bulky; you're naturally going to be paying for some features you don't want or use. But most of us keep paying anyway, because there's a few killer features which make it all worthwhile, ones that you wouldn't dare put a pricetag on. Attending university altered the entire trajectory of my life, starting from how I saw myself to what I want to accomplish. It redefined what I thought was possible for human endurance and achievement. It restored my faith in the ability of small groups to enact large positive change. It cost a pretty penny, but it has provided an unquantifiably large return on investment.",1284156229

1680348,comment,1679440,1680180,0,0,hga,,,"Errr ... I'm not sure where you came to that conclusion from what I said.  I follow the cod situation because of ""how it affects [my] dinner plate"" and because I had a near front row seat to the whole mess for a dozen years, I don't follow the blue-fin? tuna one closely because I don't care all that much about them.  And, yeah, I was raised by a fisher and <i>very</i> serious hunter and I often view animals through the lens of their ending up on my dinner plate.<p>None of that has anything to do with how much I might care about ""possible extinction"", which is something I'm mostly resigned to (e.g. see the passenger pigeon), except ... as far as I know, we're not talking about that with former apex predators. It 's just that their stocks are no longer commercially viable, the theory here being that they are now prey.<p>That might result in them going extinct, but I don't think that's the default assumption.  I bet if you wanted to set up a cod fish farm it wouldn't be <i>too</i> difficult to get wild-type breeding stock to start with.  No one's done that (as far as I know) since there are other areas with cod and similar fish that haven't seen a population collapse.",1284156218

It's essentially all ""media"".<p>Applications are not.  Developing an algorithm that can deduce what an application <i>does</i> so it can be searched for is essentially a version of the halting problem, and even approximation pretty much requires ""strong AI"" to get even remotely close on all applications.<p>Thus, application directories <i>must</i> include a form for the developer to fill out to be searchable at all.

1680345,comment,1678942,1678942,0,0,motters,,,"Interesting problem.  The solution I would try is the following.<p>1.  Apply a low pass filter, such as convolution with a 2D gaussian mask.  This will give you a bunch of (probably, but not necessarily floating point) values.<p>2.  Perform a 2D non-maximal suppression using the known approximate radius of each paw pad (or toe).<p>This should give you the maximal positions without having multiple candidates which are close together.  Just to clarify, the radius of the mask in step 1 should also be similar to the radius used in step 2.  This radius could be selectable, or the vet could explicitly measure it beforehand (it will vary with age/breed/etc).<p>Some of the solutions suggested (mean shift, neural nets, and so on) probably will work to some degree, but are overly complicated and probably not ideal.",1284156144

Throwing a bunch of early &#x27;90s communications majors onto a real UNIX workstation desktop turned out to not be the smartest idea. Who&#x27;da thunk?<p>For basic non-programming uses of a computer, I remember the NeXT being sort of a the polar opposite of the PC where the Mac was the center of the scale -- the apps were generally better than Mac apps (which were generally better than PC apps), but there were fewer of them on each step from PC->Mac->NeXT.<p>And I seem to recall that the key general-usage ones were bundled with the NeXT, so I would have thought they would have, for the time, made very <i>good</i> machines for a communications department, if the work that would go into making use of <i>any</i> computers effectively was done.<p>Sure, they <i>were</i> UNIX workstations, but one of the things about them is that you could use them without being really conscious of that.",1418507944

It seems odd, but I guess that&#x27;s why they call it &quot;dino-space&quot;.<p>Ariane 6 seems to be in response to the SpaceX challenge, at least; they aim to halve the cost per kg through cheaper and common upper/lower stage components. Which is good, but still not competitive with F9, much less a reusable version. At one point they almost made it all-solids in the first two stages, plus boosters, which would have totally doomed any future attempts at re-usability. The final design uses a F9-style common component liquid core, so they could maybe do the same thing as SpaceX later. They are still stuck with solid boosters, though, in a pork-provision move for Italy.<p>I&#x27;ve got to imagine that ULA is quietly looking into it. But it&#x27;s quite possible they&#x27;re just hoping SpaceX will eventually implode of its own internal contradictions and they can go back to their nice little government-launch monopoly. Or maybe they&#x27;ve decided they can&#x27;t do it without absurd expense, based on their internal development costs. Or maybe they just hope to coast on their existing contracts for a while, and deal with it later once SpaceX has taken all the lumps.<p>NASA, via SLS, sure isn&#x27;t looking at re-usability anymore. Lower cost to orbit via research should be their main task, if you ask me, but Congress would rather have them fly giant rockets a couple times a decade, apparently.<p>The Russians, well, are not much into changing things up. (They&#x27;ve been running Soyuz and Proton, their current launch families, since the sixties!) And their recent aerospace development programs have been less than impressive. But they have a real industry to protect, so one would hope they have a strategy.<p>I think that everyone&#x27;s waiting for SpaceX to make it work, and then they&#x27;ll get to copying. My long-term guess is that this&#x27;ll kill several of the incumbents, a few will make the transition eventually, but most of SpaceX&#x27;s competition will come from new entrants. In the meantime, SpaceX will be free to reap the profit from the margin between what it costs them and what their old-fashioned competitors can do. And/or capture the whole darn market.

I&#x27;m not sure how, or what an appropriate context is.<p>After mulling your comment over, I realize the best path on this might be to provide open information.  This is likely to operate under the same kinds of dynamics information security currently does.<p>So, let me just put it out there, maybe sort of a mini &quot;Ask HN?&quot;<p>Really, I&#x27;m unsure how to proceed.  I understand quite a bit about this and after a quick look around, I may well be quite a ways into this stuff without having realized it...<p>I started about 8 years ago.  Found a smaller venue where all but criminal speech is OK.  Moderation is very light, and the number of participants is modest, say 20 very regular contributors and another 50 or so transient ones.<p>Consistency in the regulars makes for a great control, and there is a discussion archive for analysis and data over time.  I used this archive along with various experiments to better understand how this all works.<p>Being able to go back through archives, look at intent, outcomes, dynamics and a fairly regular set of recurring, high pain topics, meant being able to run a few different scenarios with a reasonable control.<p>The other thing I did was take ideas from those adventures and apply them professionally as well as on much larger, higher prominence venues.<p>Overall, I was able to impact dialogs, sometimes to a considerable degree, and others have expressed interest as you have.<p>For some considerable time, I&#x27;ve been aware of the &quot;sock puppet&quot; type activity, as well as another interesting dynamic where people aligned with some political and economic forces actually take on a fairly professional type role without realizing it.  They take the &quot;battle cards&quot; they are given and use them more frequently than they do contribute original content.<p>Affirmation and confirmation run high in the list of gratifying social media / forum type experiences.<p>People enjoy the sport of it, but they also use that sport to affirm themselves too.  This makes things personal on a level we aren&#x27;t talking about very much.<p>Here&#x27;s a sample:<p>Take a mind.  Barring some abuse, it&#x27;s a potent mind, able to reason and understand fact vs opinion, etc...<p>Now, say that mind lies for whatever reason.  What happens?  The mind is now fragmented, or compartmentalized into the whole, vital, rational portion, and another portion that is associated with the lie.  Reason is now somewhat broken and or diminished as the mind has to manage it&#x27;s lie to avoid being caught on it, and one implication of that is extreme difficulty having dialogs that cross a boundary.<p>This is seen when seemingly rational people break down on a topic, based on a trigger word, etc...  They quite literally can&#x27;t resolve it normally due to the fact that who they are is all mixed up with this lie and the need to manage it.<p>Ordinarily, this kind of thing can resolve when it&#x27;s made OK for them to own the lie, punch through, heal, let the compartment dissolve, and they are once again whole, not impacted by any of that mess.<p>So now take that dynamic and consider when somebody elevates faith to fact, or buys into some propaganda and associates that with positive affirmation for themselves.  Say they are a bigot, or something, and rather than doing the work to resolve the bigotry and grow as a human, they seek affirmation and confirmation for the bigotry.<p>How much is that ongoing affirmation worth to them, compared to owning a character issue?<p>Turns out, that is worth a lot!  They will write the letter, cast the vote, call the friend, buy the product, and so forth to support that source of normalization.<p>In this way, advocacy is more powerful than debate, due to the fragmented reason limiting the potency of debate and it&#x27;s rational basis.  Worse, advocacy coupled with propaganda and a lot of repetition can solidify these compartments or boundaries leaving people rigid and unable to process contradictory information!<p>We end up with a more polarized dialog and when we look across the scope of major issues, actually reaching common ground, or some consensus becomes personal!  It&#x27;s quite literally a threat to somebody on a basic level to join up with their peers and do something we can live with as opposed to, &quot;the right thing&quot; as they may happen to see it!<p>Meaning, this isn&#x27;t about being wrong or right.  There rarely are clear &quot;right&quot; options, but there are often good or livable or just better options.  However, we can&#x27;t make progress on nearly any front due to the fact that people have linked their self definition of their own worth and character to lies, propaganda, etc...<p>I&#x27;ve identified a lot of these, how they work, how to recognize them, and techniques (more are needed) to make dialog more productive.<p>And on that last point, more productive dialog should be the goal, not &quot;who is right&quot;, simply due to these factors in play.  Since nearly everything is polarized and rendered personal, progress is a material threat to a very large number of us.<p>Ok, enough of that.  I could write pages...<p>What I don&#x27;t know is how to approach sharing that would do some good and or have some credence.  Given the relative lack of information, I can share examples, provide some general data, techniques, etc...<p>I&#x27;m open to any and all suggestions.<p>Some topics could be:<p>Understanding the difference between advocacy and debate.<p>What to do when others try to make their problems your problems, or make you personally part of the dialog with the intent to intimidate or make you more open to personal attacks and marginalization.<p>Establishing group norms.<p>Understanding offensive speech is as offensive as any of us personally thinks it is.<p>Weighing dialog.  Should you worry when a clown calls you out as an ass?  How about when a close friends does the same?  What is the difference and what does that mean for online dialog?<p>etc...<p>Edit:  A simple way to process the above is to realize politics, and advocacy type dialog of any kind is a contact sport.  When we can speak from a position of relative security, we speak freely and we also can accept being wrong, or contribute to and accept consensus.<p>However, when we are insecure?  We solidify around those things that bolster us, good and bad.<p>So the goal of these manipulations, and they are manipulations more than they are censorship, is to make people insecure by linking who they are to all the issues, which increases the pain of the &quot;contact&quot;, motivating them to divide and gather in ways that resonate with and enable the goals of the manipulators.  Because they are linked to it personally, they also find it very difficult to back out, &quot;heal&quot;, or come to new or common realizations, rendering the discussion of alternatives, or maybe just &quot;better&quot; options a threat when those may actually be in their best interests.",1418506226

No. But eliminating them concedes the problem to the prosecution entirely.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t, because eliminating grand juries does not eliminate the gate to a full trial; criminal cases in which that function is not served by the one-sided, prosecution-controlled grand jury process in which the target is not entitled to have representation, cross-examine witnesses or challenge evidence, present evidence, or even be informed that the process is taking place have the function served instead by a preliminary hearing in which the defendant is entitled to all of those things.<p>The grand jury indictment <i>as an alternative to the preliminary hearing otherwise used</i> is <i>not</i> a safeguard for the accused, it is a means by which the society at large (represented by the grand jury selected from among them rather than the judge handling a preliminary hearing) that the actions of the prosecutor in response to serious crimes are well-directed, it <i>trades</i> away protection of the <i>accused</i> for protection of societal interest in oversight of the executive branch by the public.<p>> You&#x27;re not the first person I&#x27;ve seen suggest this, and I&#x27;m baffled by the logic.<p>You seem to think that the alternative to the grand jury is no procedural gateway between accusation and trial, which is not the case. Its understandable that, under that misapprehension, the idea that removing the grand jury would lessen the power of prosecutors would be baffling, because it misses the alternative that actually exists and is, in fact, used for those cases where grand jury indictment is not.",1418506136

I took their video games only if they were fighting about a specific video game and I only took that specific video game and lectured them that they were doing it wrong, games were for having fun and if they were fighting with a loved one over a stupid game, they were totally missing the point. They learned to negotiate and cooperate and not fight.<p>I also sometimes took their controllers during the day because we homeschooled and &quot;10 minute&quot; breaks would turn into hours of video games and they got nothing done.

When she was younger, she would sometimes draw or play with Playmobil while we read, but still we would always read together.  When she became old enough, we would pass the book around and each read a bit.  She would typically read one or two pages, a &quot;reading sacrifice,&quot; while one of us would finish the chapter.  She is now 10.  We still read to each other every night, and she herself has become a voracious reader as well as an enthusiastic writer, using google docs to collaborate with friends and share with family and teachers.  She reads chapters of her favorite books or her own writing aloud to us.  She has her own laptop computer (chromebook to dual-boot linux for Minecraft), which I think she uses responsibly.  When she goes online to chat with friends or play on a Minecraft server, she tells us where she&#x27;s going.  Just as we&#x27;d want to know if she&#x27;s visiting a friend&#x27;s house, we want to know who she&#x27;s spending time with online.  Ditching the TV (who needs it?) and replacing it with family reading has been wonderful for all of us.<p>There are so many great books that are enjoyable for young and old alike.  It will of course depend on your and your child&#x27;s proclivities, but our favorites over the years have included: The Wizard of Oz books (all 12 volumes, some of which are quite dark, except Ozma&#x27;s birthday; blech); The Ramayana (seriously); Winnie the Pooh; Stuart Little; Narnia; Hobbit; Sherlock Holmes; Agatha Christie (we read 60 of these together after she turned 7; her favorite is The Body in the Library); Hugo Cabret; The Golden Compass; Sea of Trolls; Treasure Island; Tripods; Wrinkle in Time; Earthsea Trilogy; LOTR; Rumpole of the Bailey; James Thurber; Lemony Snicket (esp. All the Wrong Questions).  In addition, she has her own favorites that she&#x27;s read alone to herself over the years.<p>She also reads many graphic novels, which have greatly influenced her own storytelling and art.  She has loved Amulet, Flight, Delilah Dirk, In Real Life, The Silver Six, Ghostopolis, Bad Island, Zita the Space Girl, Drama, Sisters, Smile, Rapunzel&#x27;s Revenge, Bone.<p>For reading aloud, I especially recommend Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie, and other crime/mystery books with 19th-century decorum.  They expose the crime, puzzles, characters, and social dynamics, while leaving the explicit sex and violence off stage.  (She can of course ask about anything she likes.)<p>I hope people will respond with their favorite out-loud reading books.",1418505575

Maybe they didn&#x27;t charge enough. Maybe if they charged the amount necessary to earn a profit, then there is no market at that price point. The same applies to every commercial endeavor. Just like startups, everyone has a right to start something, but no inherent right to business continuity if you can&#x27;t figure out the economics of the business you want to build.<p>If the consumers are unwilling to shell out the amount necessary for a ticket to see a show at a profitable price point, then we&#x27;ve voted with our dollars that we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.<p>The truth is that the market for entertainment is an accumulatory one. Each year, new entertainment is created, diluting the value of entertainment created in previous years. It&#x27;s an unfortunate truth that entertainment persists because the marginal cost of reproduction is practically zero, meaning that once piece of entertainment is created, it doesn&#x27;t take much to sustain the availability of that entertainment for consumers ad infinitum. Musicians aren&#x27;t competing against other musicians active in the market. They are competing against every musician that ever lived and recorded music. Not only that, the market for music is competing against all other entertainment markets, which also suffer from this deflationary effect.<p>Any way you slice it, the price people are willing to pay per unit of entertainment keeps going down and will keep going down.<p>The reason other markets, like the enterprise pay better, is because most of those other industries are in the market of generating free time (time === money) at the end of the day. They are generating free time to consume for their owners and money to apply to activities to fill that free time. They also generate efficiencies that allow consumers to have more free time. People are willing to pay for things that generate time and money. Entertainment does neither for the consumer, thus the demand is lesser.<p>Furthermore, the cost of creation is not proportional to the entertainment value of the creation. Just compare meme subreddits to a Michael Bay movie.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;m not terribly bothered if many people can&#x27;t make a living as a musician. There is absolutely no lack of good music out there that everyone who isn&#x27;t a neophile could not be entertained for the rest of their life. This doesn&#x27;t mean that new music shouldn&#x27;t be created, but that the bar for the &quot;quality&quot; (by whatever measure of quality you may prefer) of music that will earn you a living is that much higher.<p>The good news is that all the people working to increase efficiencies in the world is helping generate more free time for the average person and helping reduce the cost of the instruments and equipment necessary to make music, such that the creation of good music is increasingly within the purview of Joe Q. Consumer.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but allowing more and more people to entertain themselves through the act of creation instead of consuming the creations of others, to be a great improvement on the world where only those that can make a living at something have the time and means to create.<p>For whatever it&#x27;s worth, I used to listen to music hours upon hours per day for many years and haven&#x27;t really listened to much music in 3-4 years now because I prefer silence when I am  creating (coding).<p>Creation is the hardest form of entertainment to compete against and never has creation been so accessible to so many.",1418504647

The color filter was fun, especially for starfish.<p>Now she also knows about Wikipedia and will ask every other week whether we can look something up on the iPad, e.g. why do camels have humps; we end up learning a lot of other things.

Although they are not forced to use all of it it, the standard library does expose enough of it, to force every rust programmer to be comfortable with the complexity of it.<p>In return they get the opportunity to write code that can compete with c/c++ in terms of performance, and control over latency, while still retaining safety.<p>>Would Rust be a bad choice for backend web development (ie, an alternative for Ruby/Python) and why or why not?<p>Depends on how much you care about maturity and what timescale the code has to run in production.<p>Rust code will be much faster than equivalent Ruby/Python code, but the memory management of it, will be more complicated. I would argue Go offers a better trade-off in performance, complexity and maturity for those types of projects, even though Rust is a much more interesting language.<p>So, if you can afford to not micro optimize your allocation strategies and just use a garbage collector, i would always choose to do so. Even with a language design as pretty as that of Rust.",1418504582

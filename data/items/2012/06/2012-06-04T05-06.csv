The key with these systems is too scale early, before the load gets out of hand. Also, MongoDB replica sets can only have a maximum of 12 members.",1338787526

4062781,comment,4062357,4062357,2,0,siavosh,,,"At the risk of being slightly off topic: people rarely discuss the fact that reading a book can have a negative impact on one's life. Books are just a materialization of ideas, and they can be good or bad. They can steer you down a promising path, or an equally unproductive one. And the problem with books is that they can be very persuasive, using rhetoric, 300+ pages can convince you of many things.<p>I've experienced this, and in the course of my own studies, certain books have taken me down paths that were not the optimal, and I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I hadn't read (and remembered) those books so well.<p>That said, I've become a much more critical thinker after these episodes. Sometimes it's taken years to unwind the effects, but I guess my point is, books/blog posts/people are in many ways just ideas, and influences on us. Arguing over whether we forget them or not is not the most important thing about them--what is, is developing the critical thought process to wonder if they are in fact worth remembering at all.",1338787107

A lot of those don't even seem to have any specific mechanisms to bring benefits like better compression, though they might have claims to that effect.<p>The fact that the general practice is to make claims as broad (and therefore vague) as possible doesn't leave me with good feelings about the system.

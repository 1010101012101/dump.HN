I don&#x27;t have much open (XCode, Sketch, Chrome), but it&#x27;s still using 15.36GB. That&#x27;s including 720MB XCode, and 325MB Sketch. It&#x27;s storing 9GB for apps and 4.8GB for file storage.<p>Generally, this just makes things that bit faster. The more you can store in RAM (even trivial things), the better.

They give students from rough neighborhoods a better chance to live a different life.<p>On the other hand, they decrease the quality of neighborhood schools (non-magnet) by skimming the cream from the top, if you will.<p>Now, the real problem with this system is how it deals with the intelligent but apathetic student. This student will not meet the criteria to enter one of these magnet schools, regardless of his or her test performance, and will be left in a virtual dumping ground, surrounded by few academically inclined individuals to motivate or otherwise inspire him or her. His or her teachers are likely to be burned out by the disparity of their environment. He or she may not have the right combination of toughness and grace to survive four years in this environment and is likely to become one of the roughly 50% of CPS students who drop out.<p>Now, does this seem like an appropriate path for a bright student who was unmotivated to complete their homework in the sixth or seventh grade, perhaps due to crippling emotional stress (jailed, drug addicted, or murdered parent)?<p>I don&#x27;t have a better system, but I think that we can do better.",1420808155

When assessing, rather than giving them lots of questions of varying difficulty (like a typical standard test), give them fewer questions, but make them require more thought.<p>As a parent, who helps in the classroom and observes quite a few children, I&#x27;d say that at least 10% of the children in my (typical) school would fall into the gifted category (by measured intelligence) and of those, probably more than half have some soft of learning difficulty.

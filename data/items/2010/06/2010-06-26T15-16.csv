The value of Learnivore is that it collects programming screencasts into one place, which is <i>valuable</i> but not <i>that valuable</i>.  It's not creating enough value that you could charge directly for it.<p>In order to make good money, you'd have to view the screencast aggregation as your marketing, not your product.  You'd have to invent another product to go along with this.<p>Ads are a weak example of this.  Ads would be about connecting programmers with businesses serving programmers, which you can see is a different product than screencasts.<p>Another product could be consulting.  This site could generate leads for consulting gigs, which would give you more money in one hour than you can probably make in a month with ads.",1277567604

Look for inconsistent or confusing UIs, or poor documentation.  For frequent patches, repeated patches, or regressions.  Edge cases.  A lack of integrated debugging.  Problematic upgrades.  All can be areas that tend to be short-changed.<p>Being the ""Moe"" guy in a project tends to be political; if you're doing it right, you're probably everybody's target.

1463787,comment,1463425,1463767,0,0,cageface,,,"Python and Ruby are very much alike but I find Ruby more ergonomic. It's more consistently object-oriented, which means I spend less time looking things up because the core is easier to remember. The syntax is more expressive, which makes my code shorter and easier to read. The consistent use of blocks everywhere is more intuitive and consistent than Python's mix of loops and comprehensions. I find I can take in a block of Ruby at a glance. Python requires closer inspection. Everything in Ruby is an expression that returns a value whereas Python has statements and expressions and it's up to you to remember which are which. Ruby feels to me like the product of an astute student of languages that borrowed the best ideas from Smalltalk, Lisp, Icon etc. The design mistakes in the first versions of Python, mostly now corrected, suggest to me that Guido didn't do his homework as dilligently.<p>Perhaps I'm way off here but the languages seem to me to show some of their cultural heritage. Python has a blunt & minimalistic Dutchness about it while Ruby has a Japanese elegance and style.",1277566181

We use Erlang for that.<p>Then choose in which language the server talks to the world(browsers, mobile apps, native apps, flash,...) usually through json or xml services, REST or not.

I'm not a fan of auto-pilot frameworks. I always felt they force me to think their way to build my thoughts(a personal limitation probably).<p>When we faced this decision to build our app, we took HTML5.
We know it well and it works on all platforms.
Native apps are cool, but we can't afford them as a startup.<p>Then on the browser, when you get the data you have to represent them. 
I was a fan of XML+XSLT and used to templating logic on the browser.
We use JSON now, and have built a template engine(PURE) for a similar approach and get a fast HTML rendering of JSON data.<p>And we took jquery to cope with the DOM and browser differences.<p>The server streams only data, the network likes it.

In Python, directly accessing a member is better.  (more concise, makes client code clearer.)  If you need to do magic, you can use properties.<p>In C++ and Java, you use inheritance to denote which classes have a given behavior.  In Java, you also use interfaces.  In Python, you simply give a class the needed method(s).  (I.e., you use duck typing.)  That flattens or removes lots of class hierarchies.  If you need to do magic, you can use isinstance(), issubclass() or hasattr().<p>In Python, you use the built-in types a lot.  Many problems decompose easily to lists, sets and dictionaries.  That reduces code dramatically.  Java and C++ STL's containers, in contrast, are so clumsy they make me look for ways to avoid them.  If you need to do magic, you can subclass the built-in types or build new types with the same methods as the built-ins.",1277564833

When I want to unindent, I just type backspace to go back one tab. This is simple to implement and understand, and with python, it's really all I need.<p>This kind of ""automatic indentation"" (colon-enter to indent, a quick backspace to unindent) feels much more natural to me than a C-style indent, where the editor's cue to indent would be space-rightbracket-enter and leftbracket-enter to unindent.<p>True, one cannot come accross a completely unindented block of python code and ask the editor to format it correctly for them. But by definition, unindented code is not valid python and will not run. This is not unlike C / C++ / Java code that's missing all its braces, which would not run either.",1277564750

He has a pyramid that will fight against you pretty strongly when you work 16 hour days under your desk in social isolation without result.<p>You compete, but not in the pure sense of against another company. You compete more strongly against forces that may not face others, like sociological needs, acceptance of short-term poverty, and etc.",1277564720

There's a lot of discussion about setting up different sort of habitats, a space elevator, greenhouses etc. Much of this is discussed here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAu5PD4OS-w#t=5m00s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAu5PD4OS-w#t=5m00s</a><p>There's certainly a lot of KSR's politics that bleed out of that, but he doesn't take the easy way out. His characters don't magically cure cancer, they come up with an assortment of medical treatment that among other things reduce cell division error, given the timescales involved (2020-2200) it's not unplausable that something like that would be invented.<p>They don't come up with a political system that everyone agrees with. There's a civil war over it (and almost another one). The end product is a federated system on Mars where each colony on the planet has control over its own affairs within some limits. Terraforming is a federal issue, so is water management, the right to health care and other things like that. The full text of the constitution is available in ""The Martians"". It's quite interesting.<p>Finally out of around 100k lines in the novel around 100 contain the word ""sex"". That's a fuzzy metric, but I didn't find that it discussed partying, drugs and sex out of proportion.",1277564587

With a grin he is fond of saying ""A monopoly is a terrible thing...not to have"". I think every business person harbors this fantasy sometimes.<p>But for innovative products, competition is validation. For you, your customers and your investors. The reason is that innovation brings some risk to the customer associated with adoption or integration. To the investor and innovator this looks like risk of acceptance. Competition eliminates this particular hurdle.",1277564404

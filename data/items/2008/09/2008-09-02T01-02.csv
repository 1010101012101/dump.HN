292288,comment,291918,292034,0,0,mynameishere,,,"300 atomic bombs requires 300 flights. 1.3 million tons of bombs require at least 130,000 flights [1]. Conventional bombs haven't scaled as nuclear bombs have, and I believe a single B-52 can haul about 1.3 megatons in its belly.<p>In addition, normal bombing actually didn't kill many people. (Though some of the firebombing runs did. That's what happened at Tokyo and Dresden.) As long as the air raid system and the fire depts function, the cities usually aren't that damaged.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Lancaster"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Lancaster</a>",1220320239

292284,comment,292070,292070,0,0,boredguy8,,,"I don't like the ""after a couple of rounds, 7s are allowed"". It undermines part of the randomness. Our 'house game' simply had the problem that the robber arrives too quickly. So we made the rule that the robber can't advance until Player 1 is rolling for the third time. From that point forward, the robber advances. This gives the advantage of allowing more development, but without obviating the 'randomness' of robber landing.<p>Also: Free settlers-like multiplayer: <a href=""http://games.asobrain.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://games.asobrain.com/</a>",1220319966

292274,comment,291946,292113,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It's brilliant design work. Favorite thing I've noticed so far: The trick of managing to introduce <i>N</i> different members of the design team, and give you an idea of what each one is working on, <i>during the presentation</i> by having each one deliver five lines and then hand over to the next. This trick would <i>never, ever</i> work in a screencast or a movie -- even if every individual had the acting chops to pull it off, it would feel like a circus act. But in comics, it works, because the comic characters are sufficiently abstract that they can take over from each other, almost mid-sentence, without a jarring discontinuity.<p>I swear that reading McCloud is almost enough to send me to art school.",1220318895

There's still a small number of people browsing web on mobile. The connection speed on mobile is so slow, and the mobile browser cannot load web pages designed for PC browsers or doesn't provide rich usability for it.<p>But iPhone user can enjoy browse PC websites everywhere with high speed connection. I think more and more people will use internet on iPhone frequently as they get used to it, and wonder if there'll be some users browsing Internet more on iPhone than PC in the future.",1220317747

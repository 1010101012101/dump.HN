For the unlightened, you start by asking a simple question (""Why does it snow?"") and then when you get an answer, you ask why again (""Why does the rain freeze?"") and so on until they can no longer give a satisfactory explanation.<p>Hacker News: Why do you do what you do?<p>Is it independence? Achievement? Fortune? Security? Excitement? Family? What is it? Why are those things important to you? Will you be happy when you've achieved them? Are there easier ways to do accomplish those things than what you're doing now?<p>I ask because I can't answer these questions without slightly contradicting myself. I'm hoping your wisdom will help lead me and others like me closer to those important answers.",1223089082

323299,comment,323164,323164,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Revolutionize everything.<p>That's what I'm setting out to do. I've been self-employed now for just a little over 6 months, and already I've built networks and solved I.T. problems for a number of folks locally, at a fraction of what it would have cost them otherwise. People are happy enough that, even though I've yet to do any marketing at all, my business has grown beyond my ability to handle it, on word of mouth alone.<p>But I'm only bootstrapping right now. Eventually I want to make sure that the people with skills in various areas get all the exposure they want, and that the people looking for skills can find them. I want to make all kinds of resources more available to all kinds of people. I want design and produce everything from new software to revolutionary backpacks (not so much school packs, but packs for backpackers, climbers, photographers...).<p>I've helped launch a local Rotaract club, and I'm the sole founder of a local club for ""solopreneurs"". At just over a month old, the club managed to form some relationships that are helping us to launch my county's very first inexpensive shared office space for budding entrepreneurs.<p>So, a long way to go yet, but not too bad so far either.",1223088521

323296,comment,322846,322846,0,0,briansmith,,,"The primary problem with Sony Reader is that it is too expensive. A new model that is $100 <i>more</i> expensive is counter-productive. I would buy the 505 for $150 or $200 or if I could get a $150-$200 credit for purchasing e-books.<p>The second problem with Sony Reader is that, for optimum readability, books need to be reformatted and resized specifically for its screen. Novels are okay as-is because they are laid out for small pages, but technical books' pages are usually too large to port over as-is.",1223088131

I was thinking more along the lines of letting kids who already know each other set each other up (have there parents set them up?).<p>You could even hit the whole parenting thing head on & let parents in on the action. Could be very successful in certain places. I hear China is resurrecting arranged marriages in a modern form.",1223087956

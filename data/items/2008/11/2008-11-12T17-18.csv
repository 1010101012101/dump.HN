It is possible that I completely misinterpreted his meaning.  I became aware of this possibility when I read lacker's post that said I can probably batch up data since I'm going to have latency issues anyways.  He's right, I never thought of it this way.<p>The issue I'm imagining with batching is that I cannot send any data back to visitors until the next batch is processed -- because if I do they won't see how their last post has changed their positions in the hierarchy, and they will interpret this as a system error.  In other words, every time a member receives a response from the server, that response <i>must</i> indicate his last post's position in the hierarchy.<p>Theoretically I could run a batch every second, and although this means holding up all the responses to requests that come in during the previous second, one second is also short enough that they will not interpret it as a problem with the system.  On the other hand, 5 seconds in between batches would certainly be seen as a server problem especially by folks on high speed connections.",1226512049

It's rarely the case that all of a given user's information is stored in a single table (and for good reason... read up on normalization (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization</a>) if you're not sure why), but it can sure save a lot of programmer time if your data model acts like it's all in a single table.<p>The case of multiple applications or systems talking to a single database isn't really all that different from a single application talking to a database, unless you only have one database call in your entire application.  As soon as you're talking to the database in more than one spot in your code, unless you're careful, you start running into the brittleness/dependency issues described by the author.<p>Even if you're the only one working on a given application, in three months you'll have little chance of remembering every dependency created by every database interaction in your application.

If your constraints allow you to not use a database, you could consider a data structure that inserts data in such a way that it is always sorted.<p>Also, as an improvement to your point 1, you should put most of the JavaScript itself as well as images, etc somewhere else - with this your bandwidth will be used only for the dynamic data (which will be more than enough).<p>Finally, the best tool I know for scalability are queues.

362013,comment,361730,361730,0,0,owkaye,,,"Retric said if I provide data that's accurate +/- .2 seconds that's close enough, but he's wrong (sorry Retric, it's not your fault).  The fact is, I must provide each member with the relative position of his post each time he makes one, and the only way I know to do this is to append the new record first, and then do a search and sort to determine where his new post appears in the sorted list.<p>Retric, you said I'm not going to be able to sort things that fast for every new post.  Do you know this to be true?  Is this an absolute fact or are you theorizing?<p>I'm not suggesting that you wrong when you say this, but I certainly do not want to assume you're right just because you say so -- because unless there's another way to determine the position of the new post in a sorted list I may have no other choice but to abandon the existing approach, re-work the entire business plan, and try something else from a completely different angle.  I prefer to NOT do this when the current concept is the best I've come up with.<p>What abut other people's experiences?  Do any of you know about data systems that can do an append, followed by a search and sort on one field, at the rate of 16,000 times a second?  Or is there another way to determine the position of a record in a sorted list without sorting the db to rceate that sorted list?<p>How about if the database is kept entirely in RAM? I know this will speed things up a lot, but will sorts be fast enough for 16,000 a second without bogigng down?<p>mseebach, you asked ""What exactly is the output?"" and I'm not sure if your question was directed to me but if it was, and if you're asking about the data that needs to be sent from the server back to the browser, then I think I might need to send only ""one character"" back to the Javascript.  Previously I was going to send an entire HTML page but it seems the Javascript solution could be orders of magnitude more efficient.  By using the Javascript approach I can send only 10 chars to the server and receive only one char back from the server.  The Javascript can then convert that one char to the proper ""relative position"" value for display in the browser -- or so I hope.<p>bd, you said I might do better to build my own custom in-memory data structure rather than use a classical ready-made database solution.  Maybe you're right.  It would certainly reduce the costs over a super-expensive high-speed database solution, wouldn't it?  I've never done such a thing before but maybe I can find someone who has.  Any suggestions?<p>bd, you also said I do not want to sort the whole dataset after each new piece of data comes in, and you're right about that too.  What I really need is to insert each piece of data in the proper pre-sorted position as it comes in.  Then I never have to sort the data later because it's being sorted before or as it enters the db.<p>spinonethird, you said that from my description I'm not really using the db and maybe I can roll my own specialized data structure.  You and bd seem to think alike, and with two of you in consensus I'm becoming more attracted to this idea, especially if it has the potential for faster performance than an off-the-shelf database program.<p>AS far as the business details are concerned, I know some people (gsiener, rbanffy and perhaps others) are curious but I'm not at liberty to discuss the details at this time.  When I eventually spill the beans it will probably be after the business launches so we can gain traction and market share before the competition invades our turf ... :)<p>One question before I end this post:<p>Is C the fastest language or the best language to ""roll your own"" databse solution, or are other languages just as good or better?  I'm not up-to-date on the advantages of many programming languages so your thoughts and opinions on this issue might help me to pick the best language for a project like this.  Thanks.",1226510088

Or, if thats really not enough, I'd look up Hadoop riding on GlusterFS.  You're going to have synchrony and blocking problems no matter what, though, without really creative keying (bigtable style?).  Both Facebook and Google have run up against these kinds of issues and have written and/or released source about it.  Facebook has OSS'd Cassandra, their distributed database, and Google hasn't released much code but has papers out on their implementations of MapReduce (open source port->Hadoop, as suggested above) and BigTable (which the Hadoop team are in the process of cloning with HBase).",1226509321

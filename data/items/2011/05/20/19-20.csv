The 1988 estimate was ""0.26+/-0.05 ÂºC"" so ""0.25C per decade in 1990"" would be a more accurate statement than the overly accurate/imprecise ""0.30"" you quoted here.<p>That sequence of 0.30C, 0.20C, 0.15C could very well be 0.26, 0.18, 0.17 if rounding rules were chosen with a view towards exaggerating for the sake of truthiness. But let's say it isn't - without knowing the reason for the changes, and especially without knowing the error bars, then it's hard to comment on the apparent decline. The 1988 paper is one of the first global climate models, so perhaps the parameters needed refinements which later researchers have done.<p>""In the United States, nearly 90% of official thermometers surveyed by volunteers violate official siting requirements that they not be too close to an artificial heating source.""<p>That has been researched a lot. The phrase ""artificial heat source"" is a deliberate distraction. The complaint is that the thermometers are too close to parking lots or other things which might contribute an ""urban heat island"" effect. This is quite different than ""artificial heat source"" which sound like it's next to a boiler or engine or exhaust from a building.<p>However, throw out those 90% and look at the 10% and the signal is still there. Look at the sea-based thermometers, and the satellite measurements, and the signal is still there. Thus, the putative ""artificial heating source"" has no significant effect on the measurements. See for example <a href=""http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/global_warming/global_warming_misinformation_urban_heat_island.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/global_warming/global_wa...</a> .<p>""since 2001 the global temperature has levelled off.""<p>That's a biased sample error. 1998/1999 was a hot spike. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Satellite_Temperatures.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Satellite_Temperatures.png</a> . Extend the average over a longer time and the trend is more obviously trending upward. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Global_Temperature_Anomaly_1880-2010_(Fig.A).gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Global_Temperature_Anomaly...</a><p>""The Earth has been in a warming trend ...""<p>That's a meaningless statement. No one contests that it's warmer now than the Little Ice Age. The question is, what impact do humans have on the warming trend? Pulling numbers out of thin air: If the breakdown is 0.01C ""naturally"" per decade and humans during the last century have gotten it to raise by 0.16C per decade, then the natural influences are minor and it's best to be concerned about the human contribution.",1305921571

They are no different than what you have internally - and you have to really understand the pros and cons of cloud deployment as it specifically pertains to your business.<p>The cloud is fantastic for any service that needs to be abstracted from the tactical infrastructure deployments of hardware so they can focus on their core service (Netflix being the most beautiful example of this)<p>But where does the cloud not make sense?<p>Internal traditional IT services that are never going away: Active directory, file, print, security, etc..<p>So - does the cloud change the role of the CIO - no not at all.<p>What it does do it start to change the technology choices that the CIO has to pick from, understand and evaluate.<p>Managed services (ASP/Saas/PaaS/Iaas/ETC) make sense when you want to leverage the infrastructure expertise of a provider and your mission is to deliver content or an application. You could still utilize the cloud for large scale apps like ERP, EHR and even file storage (dropbox enterprise better come soon or I'll have to go knock on Drews door) -- but putting large scale, mission critical apps in the cloud introduces a layer of points-of-failure that many enterprises are not yet comfortable with.<p>So, to mitigate the risks of relying on cloud services, an organization - a CIO in specific, better make sure he has a top network architect advising on multiple carrier, divergent pathing to the internet to ensure that you eliminate premise inet failures as a POF to your service.<p>Finally - the idea behind an enterprise (traditional enterprise) leveraging cloud services is to (ideally) use the cloud as a elastic capacity rather than sole source.<p>The starting question in the eval should be: WTF do we do when AWS goes down?<p>If your first question about any service is not ""WTF do we do about downtime"" -- then you shouldn't be a CIO.",1305921513

The <i>desired outcome</i> of ditching points was to see if it could generate better discussion. The thing is, there are a certain sub-set of users (personally, I'm ambivalent) who really, really want the point system back, and don't necessarily agree with the assertion that HN was on the decline to begin with.<p>I have a tendency to use HN in a few ways:<p>* As a tech industry firehose: I review headlines in RSS (Reeder) and only 'v' through to headlines that really pique my interests.<p>* As a means to directly interact with smart people whom I would not otherwise meet (I'm in a small town in Florida).<p>* As a means to understand how people feel about the ideas I'm reading.<p>That last use case has been more or less squashed by the removal of visible points. I can only know how much the community agrees or disagrees with what <i>I</i> say, not those in disagreement with me. What's ironic is that agreement/disagreement wasn't the purpose of the karma system at HN to begin with. That's just how it was frequently used.<p>You can blame this on the fact that the attribution of karma points on HN was supposed to be driven by causes that many people simply don't think about. Put another way, voting the way we're intended to isn't intuitive to most people. This situation is made worse by the fact that virtually every other site with a similar voting system uses it to express agreement/disagreement, rather than conversational contribution/detraction.<p>The benefit of transparency is offset by the many well argued counter-points.

2569155,comment,2568303,2568652,10,0,Vargas,,,"Elections in Spain are not rigged, but the quality of Spanish democracy is very low. There are three main points:<p>1. Electoral Law: In Spain votes are counted according to D'Hondt method in regional demarcations. It favours big parties while penalizing small parties. It makes votes in less densely populated regions more valuable. Both things are perceived as very unfair by many Spaniards. (See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method</a>)<p>2. Separation of Power: In Spain, Congress is very powerful while Senate is mostly decorative. People vote once every four years for Congress, then they elect the President. There is no separation between Executive and Legislative. In the U.S. or France you can have a Democrat President and a Republican Congress. That is not possible in Spain, Executive and Legislative are always in the hands of the same party by design. Judicial power is not independent as judges are appointed by the party in power. Older judges (some people may remember Garzon, the guy who tried to incarcerate Pinochet) are independent but younger ones <i>ALWAYS</i> vote whatever is decided by the party that granted them the seat.<p>3. Political regeneration: In Spain you cannot vote for a person for Congress, you can only vote for a party list. The party will put whoever they want in the list in whatever the order they want. This system has led to a progressive degeneration where only friends and family of powerful party members are listed. Many of the candidates in the upcoming elections (22nd of May) have been found guilty of corruption. Many more are awaiting trial. Almost all of them have no leadership qualities at all. Their only quality is to be a disciplined party member with connections. Parties in Spain are not democratic themselves. Primary elections within a party are almost unheard of. Candidates for any election are decided by the senior management.\nIn Spain, when a candidate loses, they just wait for the next election, or the next, or the next... until they finally grab power. It is a case of ""waiting your turn"".<p>In Spain we frequently use ""partitocracy"" (rule of parties) and ""fingercracy"" (rule of those who have been chosen by a powerful party member by pointing at them with his finger) to describe our political system.",1305920673

2569092,comment,2568453,2568453,4,0,jcr,,,"Typing is kinda difficult for me on most days, so I don't comment much.\nI vote a little bit on comments, when I bother to read them, but I tend\nto vote-up more on submissions. I've also have been known to do a lot of\nflagging on the /newest queue (and even triggering the ""excessive\nflagger"" threshold).<p>I do try to remember to make new submissions for all to enjoy, but the\nirony is, this means I'm off somewhere else looking for interesting\nstuff rather than finding it here. The stuff that <i>I</i> find interesting\nis new tech, engineering, security and science developments (i.e.\nhacking up new solutions and analysis) along with a small splattering of\nbusiness.<p>The speed of churn on the /newest queue means some of my submissions are\nnot even seen. On average, there's maybe two or three other people here\nwith similar interests to mine, or better said, they appreciated the\nsubmission enough to up-vote. But that is on average, so plenty of my\nsubmissions vanish into obscurity with no notice. --This is not a\ncomplaint. Other people have other interests, and the fast queue\nprogression should be expected when there is no barrier to entry.<p>The trouble is, the fast queue means submitters get very little <i>USEFUL</i>\nfeedback. If you post some link-baited controversy, getting 1000+ points\non the submission is not too unusual, but it probably isn't noteworthy\nnew hacking. The <i>good hacking stuff</i> on HN seldom hits the main /news\npage, instead it's buried deeply in the /newest queue. --It has always\nbeen like this. Blame human nature. If you look at /classic or do some\nHN spelunking by item?id= or hit archive.org for old snapshots, you'll\nfind the main /news page has neither improved nor declined.<p>I think gaining points for submissions is unfair. In my opinion, I think\na submission just says, ""Hey, I thought this was interesting, and you\nmight too."" When a submission is sincere, it's just a friendly gesture\nwith good intentions. But we all know how good intentions work. Whether\nor not the submissions is ever seen by others here, or more importantly,\nis interesting hacking <i>to them</i> is generally unknown, even to the\nsubmitter. The displayed up-votes on submissions are really just a\npopularity contest feeding on link-baited controversy.<p>Another reason why gaining points for submissions is unfair is a\nsubmission has vastly superior visibility compared to a comment. I\nbelieve PG has some secret sauce running to address the visibility\ndiscrepancy. As far as I've been able to divine through observation,\npoints from submissions don't count towards the ""average"" listed in your\nprofile. Well, it seems that way on my account, but I think even older\nand more active commenting members (grellas) may have their average\ncalculated with both submissions and comments. (Don't get me wrong, when\ngrellas posts, I read it, and usually up-vote. I doubt I'm alone on that\nso his exceedingly high average might be warranted from comments alone).<p>So the display of points on submissions fails to be particularly\nvaluable metric. Similar could be said for the display of points on\ncomments. I refuse to care what other people think of you or your\nstatements, and I would prefer avoid being biased by displayed points so\nI make up my own mind on whether or not I find your comment interesting.<p>For notes, it was tptacek that made the suggestion to remove the display\nof comment points in the ""Stave Off The Decline of HN"" thread from PG. I\nthought his idea was brilliant, possibly because I had the same idea,\nbut as usual, tptacek thought of and posted it first. If you want a\ndiscussion to be useful, turning it into a game is entirely\ncounter-productive. Worse yet, the display of points creates an unfair\ngame due to manipulations of visibility, cognitive bias and other\nfactors.<p>Since the removal of comment points being displayed, there has been far\nless one-up-manship in the discussions, and people are more polite\nbecause they are not competing for points in a game. You are now more\nfree to just state your opinion without worrying about whether or not\nothers will agree or disagree with you. As long as you're not being an\nass about it, you can generally post uncommon or even controversial\nopinions without repercussions.<p>Some have (repeatedly) argued that the lack of displayed comment points\nresults in a loss of context or loss of a valuable metric for deciding\nwhat is worth reading. I'd argue the opposite (and slightly less popular\nview) that displayed comment points fail to offer any real usefulness\nand are mostly harmful. --Just like whether or not my submissions are\ninteresting, the usefulness of displayed comment points is a very\nsubjective matter of opinion. Some find it helpful, but others consider\nit harmful.<p>To you, my opinion about comment points does not matter. You already\nhave your own opinion. <i>And there is the very reason why displaying\ncomment points doesn't really matter</i>.",1305919705

2569027,comment,2566726,2566726,2,0,earl,,,"I'd tend to say big company.  Go to google or microsoft for two to three years.  You'll go to a company with strong mentoring to help you dramatically improve your development skills, and you can almost view it as getting a masters in software engineering if you work hard and take advantage of everything the company has to offer.  You'll get a great introduction to things like testing in practice, using and configuring linux in practice, developing good taste in software development practices, debugging large systems, what large systems should look like in order to be maintainable, source code control systems, etc.  You should also be able to live relatively inexpensively and save a great deal of money.<p>After your two to three years, go to a startup.  You'll get the increased responsibility and have the skills and experience to take advantage of it.<p>In my view, the problem with going to a startup is they tend to need you to be productive in a real hurry.  There won't be much if any mentorship and often you'll be left to work autonomously.  Frequently you won't even get reviews or feedback, which isn't as bad as it sounds, because often your boss won't be able to give good feedback anyway -- remember that at a startup your bosses are probably learning as they go just as much as you are.  If you haven't developed good taste in software and a sense for how to build big systems -- something virtually no undergrad has, with the exception of people who've done a bunch of open source -- you can get yourself into a pretty bad place.  Bright people can often overcome bad software development practices, but only for so long, and when the tech debt hits you it hits hard.<p>Edit: plus, if you go big company first, you can have little debt and $15k+ in the bank.  There's nothing in the world as reassuring as knowing that if shit happens with your paycheck, you have 3-6 months to find a new job and won't have any trouble paying bills meanwhile.",1305918616

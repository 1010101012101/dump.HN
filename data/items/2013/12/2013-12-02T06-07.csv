Just because other people think you have to use a talent in a certain way doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what&#x27;s best for you.<p>&quot;I quit because baseball was sacred to me until I started getting paid for it. The more that “baseball” became synonymous with “business,” the less it meant to me, and I saw less of myself in the game every time I got a check from the Philadelphia Phillies Organization, the Oakland Athletic Company, or the Chicago Cubs, L.L.C. To put it simply, other players were much better than I was at separating the game of baseball from the job of baseball.&quot;<p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sportingscene/2013/10/why-i-quit-major-league-baseball.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sportingscene/2013/10/...</a>",1385967479

Unlike Instacart, Buttr shoppers decide which items to buy and charge a flat fee, no markups.<p>Buttr is live with a handful of paying subscribers, buying a few thousand dollars a month in groceries. I hacked the product together myself using Zapier and open source ecommerce software. Previously, I served as the founder/CEO of a funded crowdsourcing company ($1.1M from Google & Mitch Kapor) that was acquired last year.<p>The ideal partner has co-founded a funded company before and witnessed first hand the bullshit and emotional craziness that comes with the territory, and despite everything, wants to do it again. My goal is to build a big, valuable company with a fanatical customer base. Raising money and impressing VCs is a means, not an ends. Hopefully you feel the same.<p>You should be extremely technical yet understand that technology is only a means to an end, a tool for man to judged only by how it helps men (and women) achieve. Though able to solve the hardest of problems, you should endeavor to architect solutions in a way that avoids or bypasses the most challenging problems altogether. Operating leverage--your ability to do so much with so little--not technical brawn, should be your claim to fame.<p>Interested? Email me at matt@buttr.co",1385967320

I may just be lucky, but I believe my methods give me an edge.<p>I study the market fundamentals and prioritize the long-term health of a company over short-term profits. I like companies that are never in the news, on the theory that lack of attention lowers demand. I think about long-term economic trends, like the center of US population moving west and the increasing price of oil.<p>But right now the stock market seems too hot, so I am investing in other assets. Eventually, there will be a bust, stocks will fall and gold will rise, and I will sell gold and buy stocks. Nothing apocalyptic, just the normal business cycle that has been repeating for centuries. Corporate investors do not have the luxury of thinking this far in the future, because their management and clients are focused on quarterly profits.

I remember reading about somebody doing this last summer on HN.<p>> This is going to draw a lot of attention from regulators<p>You betcha<p>> and I can&#x27;t help but think they will want nothing more than to stop or slow Amazon from further disruption in the retail space.<p>And that&#x27;s where I have to disagree. Average people go to large retailers because they are cheap. My mom works in retail and she manages to buy unbelievably cheap clothes after stacking several discounts - something the average person just can&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t) do on Amazon. And that makes a huge difference. The prices and the experience offered by <i>some</i> retailers is unmatched.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Amazon works great if you&#x27;re buying electronics or books. But I&#x27;d never buy clothes, furniture, or toiletries online because the experience is awful and it&#x27;s usually cheaper to go out and buy what I need IRL. It&#x27;s not regulators that are stopping Amazon from disrupting retail; it&#x27;s Amazon.",1385967162

Prior to that I worked with Perl, Python and Ruby and I still work with these languages for quick scripting or if the codebase demands it.<p>Scala code-bases tend to be based to a higher degree on good engineering practices. Scala itself is a much more static language than a language like Java, hence it gives you plenty of compile-time safety, with its static type system being one that helps you, instead of staying in your way. Even a tricky feature (now market as experimental SIP-18 and so they have to be explicitly enabled), like implicit conversions, is far more safer than the monkey patching that goes on in Ruby/Python, as it&#x27;s lexically scoped, doesn&#x27;t modify anything and the compiler throws errors if there are conflicts.",1385965155

6832020,comment,6831461,6831827,5,0,gjmulhol,,,"Over that time was also a massive tech bubble. What did the S&P 500 do over that time? A tech fund? Actually, I have that answer. If you bought AAPL on Feb 25, 2008 (or thereabouts, it was the only time in the last 10 years it was around that price) you could have bought an S&P index fund at 1,222. Today, that would be a 50% unrealized gain -- not that great. BUT, were you rebalancing to your optimal portfolio, you would have been continuously selling as it rose. In the crash of 2008, you would have had no choice -- based on your optimal portfolio -- to buy a bunch more S&P, which you would have then tripled. Again, not near your AAPL number, but the risk profile of that investment is also much lower. Add the fact that you have focused on the tech sector because of your perceived knowledge, and that is why you have a higher return. But you are betting on the belief you have in these companies. There is an emotional component. I personally believe AAPL is laughably undervalued at 550, but there are lots of smart people out there -- smarter than I am -- that have much lower price targets and are actively shorting the stock. I have 5 stocks in my portfolio that I believed in -- thought they had something -- and really know the field well -- graduate degree and years of work experience well. Some have panned out, others haven&#x27;t. Over the long term -- retirement length (>20-30 years) -- index funds and a balanced investment strategy is objectively better.<p>Also: If you bought AAPL at $35.72, your unrealized gain today is more like 1456% (based on a last trade price of 550.06).<p>Disclaimer: I am also at a business school, so maybe we are all just being sold the same snake oil. I sorta doubt it, though. Both of our schools are respected, and our professors are largely people who have spent a lot of time learning these lessons the hard way.",1385964324

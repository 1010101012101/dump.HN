133213,comment,133055,133055,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"The fact that he grouped Java with Ruby/Python shows how much he has to learn. If anything I regard Java and C#(.NET) as roughly equivalent in my mind. Both can be used by good programmers to do neat things, but the vast majority of the time they are by-words for overly specified inflexible crap code.<p>I don't think it's necessarily the language (although both seem way too verbose for my tastes --- and a little too focused on nouns), but more a factor of industry acceptance. As soon as Java became the industry standard successor to Cobol, they started tacking on all this formal-robust-enterprisey crap that just made the code require a heavy duty IDE to deal with. It stopped looking elegant and fun and started looking like the schematic to build the HVAC system for a skyscraper. Ditto for C#.<p>I would argue the main problem with the Microsoft ecosystem in general is that everything costs money. Development tools cost money, libraries cost money, even the freaking support of experts-exchange costs money. Why pay for all this stuff when the rest of the programming world already thrives on freely exchanging information. It makes learning cheaper and faster, and probably leads to more rapid development, since new stuff is easier to learn about. When I wanted to figure out how bittorrent works, I just went and read the spec published by Bram Cohen. I didn't have to call up his company and ask for a Certified Bittorrent Engineer to come out and train me onsite in a three day session that costs $8000. The whole ecosystem is focused on making a buck off the developer, instead of helping the developer make a buck off his customers. (That said, the .NET ecosystem seems moderately better about this, from my limited experience with it.)",1205166321

I remember playing in a large group in high school, and the best proponents were the two most devotely Christian members of my year.  These two, butter wouldn't melt in their mouths, so when they proposed an alliance, you believed them.  The wopping great big dagger that you subsequently found in your back always came as a big surprise.<p>The worst was that one of them even had the ability to explain to you that it was all a strategic move to make the guy he had sided with to trust him.  Evil guy would then backstab erstwhile ally, using YOU as the hammer.  And of course you'd happily go along with it.<p>But that's not what's really evil about Diplomacy.  What's really evil is that you NEED alliances just to survive, so you can't just blow these guys off if they are on your borders.<p>Evil.",1205165816

133204,comment,132640,132792,0,0,omnipath,,,"No, it's not a unique situation. Or rather, it's only unique in one way: if failure occurs, it occurs loudly, spectacularly, and in front of millions of people. The article itself mentioned the Denver airport, where billions of dollars still didn't prevent software errors from happening, delaying a massive project. And let's not forget the cascading failures that happened just last year because of bad weather and poor planning/routing software programs.<p>Every time this article is posted, and it's been around since at least 2004, the one thing that strikes me profoundly is how great communications play an integral part in the entire affair. It's getting to the point where we as software programmers and engineers can't improve our software and craft until we learn the importance of communication, between ourselves and our clients. Yeah, we talk about it, but we don't really implement it. It's like saying we understand the need to watch what we eat to be healthy, and yet still eating a McDonalds value meal every meal, only with Diet Soda instead regular.<p>We need to improve our all parts of our craft to grow. Technically is alright. The people part, the interaction part, the expectation part, goal-setting, testing, planning needs to improve tremedously. We know the problem, and we must provide the solution. If a client doesn't know what they want, ask more information. Educate the client about how the development process should work. Find out more about the industry. See what was wrong/troublesome about the old way they did their business. If information isn't making it's way from the managers to the coders/planners, find the problem and eliminate it. This is not new. I am not smart, and I know these problems. Surely, we can do better.<p>Yes, the projects will probably end up taking longer. Yes, development will probably end up costing more. But it will be better. And the clients will be happier.<p>p.s.

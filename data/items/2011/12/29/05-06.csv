The simple method that computes the CDF and uses binary search for sampling is called ""Roulette wheel selection"" in this writeup.<p>The only difference at the big-O level between the ""beautiful algorithm"" and the above simple algorithm is, the latter takes log(n) steps for sampling versus O(1) (setup and memory usage are the same).<p>How many problems have n large enough so const1*log(n)+const2 is significantly more than the constant in O(1) algorithm?  Not many, I'll bet, especially since const1 and const2 are small due to the simplicity of the simple CDF-based algorithm.<p>If it was O(sqrt(n)) vs. O(1), this would be a different thing, but log is different.<p>This is not to diminish the inherent interest in the sampling arguments used, and the existence of a big-O faster algorithm.",1325137952

Especially when compared to the upper-level math ""strip the scaffolding"" approach, which always leaves you wondering ""How the hell did anyone ever think of that?""<p>One small nitpick. [tl;dr - please pick a proper license when you publish code on the net] I went to the code snippets page because I was considering using this code in one of my projects (it's a bit cleaner than the code I've been using), and found this statement:<p><i>If you're interested in using any of this code in your applications, feel free to do so! You don't need to cite me or this website as a source, though I would appreciate it if you did. However, please don't plagiarize the code here by claiming authorship - that would just be dishonest. I also caution you that while I'm fairly confident that the code on this site is correct, I haven't mercilessly tested every line, and so there may be a lurking bug or two here.</i><p>Please, if you're releasing code on the Internet that you hope for people to use, just pick a standard license, and ideally, put the license specification in the comments of the code itself (this one sounds like MIT, BSD, or zlib would probably be fine with the author). I know, you're being nice, you're being casual, you want people to use your stuff, and you're not going to sue anyone.<p>But a self-penned informal license like this means that when Joe Java wants to pull in AliasMethod.java to help out a math library that he's working on at his bank job, he can't just go ahead and do it, because it's not on the pre-cleared list of code licenses that he's allowed to import external code under. He has to get explicit approval from legal first, which means that he has to convince someone there that spending 15 minutes looking over the license text and deciding whether it's solid enough to trust is a worthwhile use of time, all over a couple dozen lines of code that he could implement a naive version of in 20 minutes plus testing. At a lot of companies, that just means ""no."" It also presents difficulties for open source projects that might otherwise like to incorporate your code because of license compatibility concerns, in many cases requiring them to e-mail you for specific permission to include your code inside a differently-licensed project.<p>More concretely, I'd be nervous relying on this license statement for a couple reasons: first, it says ""using any of this code in your applications"". Would a separately distributed library file be considered an ""application"", or are we only allowed to use the code inside full running programs? Second, what about redistribution of the source code, and derivative works? It's sort of implied that this is allowed (how would someone claim authorship of this bit of code if they weren't redistributing it?), but a proper license should make source redistribution and modification rights extremely explicit, without that it's typically assumed that there are none.",1325137590

This is important for scalability.\n(Whether ""pure"" REST is appropriate for a given API, or will be adopted  if it is, is another question.)<p>If too much is done on the client-side, it loses some of the benefits of webapps, such as easier to pirate the working code; so the competitive advantage needs to be in the data (or in the server side processing) rather than the client app itself.<p><i>EDIT</i> There's a general problem with RESTful APIs: they are fixed and can't be adapted to every use. You might end up doing a lot of transformation on the client side to assemble the info you want, and it might take several calls, causing latency. What's needed is something like relations and SQL, so you can extract the data in whatever structure you need, taking into account latency (assembled on the server, the message short though including oft-needed related data, and minimizing slow network trips). An obvious solution is for the server to just accept SQL directly - i.e. for <i>that</i> to be your RESTful API.<p>This doesn't sound right - it's certainly not a conventional RESTful API - but what exactly is the problem with it?<p>I think we don't have it yet, because there isn't a need for it in these early days - because, so far, it's common for one server to be used by just one client application, so that they are specifically customized for that one use-case. But what will happen when several different client applications want to use the same server? Secondly, these APIs are new, and there has been little time for them to change much, so the problem of compatibility with old clients hasn't arisen much.<p>SQL solves both these problems, of different application and of changes, but these problem don't exist so far. And I guess it's not certain that they will exist - if clients are always silently upgraded; if for a second app you just create a second RESTful API for it (so the integration occurs further back, at the database, instead of at the API).",1325135479

It certainly couldn't handle every use case, but maybe with some convention-style configurations (e.g. a record created via a POST to /users would hash any ""password"" field) you could handle a bunch of typical web app scenarios.<p>And if that doesn't work, perhaps the schema-less prototyping is a free tier with a more robust backend service offering for the paid tier?",1325135236

You can mitigate a lot of this with bounce and slave units.

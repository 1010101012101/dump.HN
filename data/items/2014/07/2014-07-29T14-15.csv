For instance, if you drag an image onto an image search page that normally accepts text, the search box can become a giant drop target with &quot;drop image here to search&quot; text.  And if you drag a non-image onto the same page, the page can check the MIME type and give the user UI that says that won&#x27;t work.",1406645785

8102512,comment,8099713,8101189,2,0,heavenlyhash,,,"I typically find that in practice, strong links between a project and its dependencies are not a drawback.<p>If large amounts of your code change across different projects at the same time, those projects don&#x27;t have a very stable API nor are the evidentally actually developing separately, so there&#x27;s no major reason to pretend they are isolated or introduce a binary release protocol between them.  Projects like this will probably find the greatest ease of operation by just sticking to one source repository -- otherwise, commits for a single &quot;feature&quot; are already getting smeared across multiple repositories, and stitching them back together with some hazy concept of &quot;latest&quot; at a particular datetime isn&#x27;t helping anyone.<p>The biggest indicator of over-coupled projects that are going to face friction is when ProjectCore depends on ProjectWhirrlyjig, but the Whirrlyjig test code still lives in ProjectCore.  This tends to make it very difficult to make releases of ProjectWhirrlyjig with confidence, since they won&#x27;t be tested until getting to ProjectCore.  If projects are actually maintaining stable features on their own in isolation, this shouldn&#x27;t be what your flow looks like.<p>Projects that <i>are</i> well isolated generally don&#x27;t seem to have a hard time committing to stable (if frequent) release cycles.  Furthermore, it actually encourages good organizational habits, because it actively exerts pressure against making changes that would cross-cut libraries or make it difficult to create tests isolated to a single project.<p>In contrast, tools that regularly update to &quot;the latest&quot; version invariably seem to bring headaches down the road.<p>Getting &quot;the latest&quot; is ambiguous.  It means that your build will not be reproducible in any automated way, whether it&#x27;s one week or one hour from now.  It&#x27;s a moving target.  Can you do a `git bisect` if something goes wrong and you need to track down a change?<p>Getting &quot;the latest&quot; also doesn&#x27;t take into account branching.  This is something a team I&#x27;m currently on is poignantly aware of: feature branches are used extensively, and when this concept spans projects, we found &quot;latest&quot; ceases to mean anything contextually useful.<p>If you&#x27;re working on projects where a CI server is actually part of the core feedback loop (say your test suite has gotten too unwieldy for any single developer to run before pushing), then a fetch &quot;latest&quot; can be helpful to enable this during development.  But even if jenkins informs you the build is green, it&#x27;s important to remember this won&#x27;t be reproducible in the future; you should make an effort to get back to precisely tracked dependencies as soon as possible.<p>mdm deals with this by letting you use untracked versions of your dependency files... but it will consistently <i>show that</i> in `git status` commands, so that you A) <i>know</i> that your current work isn&#x27;t reproducible by anyone else and B) everyone is encouraged to make an effort to get back on track ASAP.",1406645643

Saving a snail darter is demonstrably not worth the effort. The so-called &#x27;ecosystem&#x27; we live in has been completely reformatted repeatedly by human intervention. And we&#x27;re all still here.  So its fragility is highly overstated.<p>And the intrinsic value of species is also overrated. Now that we&#x27;re on the cusp of reinventing creatures through direct dna programming, native species become completely devalued.  What does it matter which creatures happen to be occupying our planet when we came to a level of civilization? Its a coincidence; many more came before and went extinct, and we don&#x27;t cry over them.<p>Just look at the artificial ecosystems we create - they aren&#x27;t in and danger of collapsing - urban lawns, the vast corn crops of the bread basket, Phoenix.

8102258,comment,8101819,8102107,10,0,vonmoltke,,,"> For many people, safety has a higher political priority than privacy. However, when you start saying that mass surveillance kills jobs, it gets much more attention because economic issues are usually on par or above safety concerns.<p>Then there are people like my wife, who thinks <i>disclosure</i> hurt the US politically and economically, thus rationalizing that it is Snowden&#x27;s fault for revealing all these surveillance programs, not the NSA&#x27;s for having them in the first place.  I think that attitude, combined with &quot;safety > privacy&quot; and &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; are very common amongst more politically-aware people.  I, unfortunately, can&#x27;t come up with many good, non-tinfoil rebuttals.",1406642643

The problem is that a bug in Dropbox&#x27;s client turned a de-sync operation into a delete operation. So one way to see it is that even having local storage was not safe because the sync was flawed. Another possible way to look at it is if your only local copy is synced with the cloud, then effectively your only storage is online.",1406642605

The constitution, from my understanding, grants the federal government power to do certain things. Therefore, if the constitution doesn&#x27;t specifically grant the federal government the power/ability to run, say the NSA (or other federal department), does that not warrant the entire thing unconstitutional?",1406642562

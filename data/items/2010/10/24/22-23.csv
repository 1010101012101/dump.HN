If the fish are higher profit, many businesses will start selling them instead of better things which make them less money.<p>><i>A decade ago, few Americans ate tilapia. ... Then demand surged in the wake of the Atlantic cod fishery collapse.</i><p>Which caused Atlantic cod prices to skyrocket, I'd bet (I don't remember).  Similar to how the oil spill caused shrimp prices to skyrocket.<p>None of which implies anything about <i>demand</i>, merely <i>supply</i>.  But ""Americans keep ordering more"" states a change in <i>demand</i>.  ""American companies keep ordering more"" might be more accurate.  Inundate the market with something non-offensive, and you're assured better sales than before.<p>edit:<p>Hah!<p>><i>""China's track record in certain areas isn't perfect,"" says Bill Mardon ...

1827606,comment,1826471,1827197,0,0,techsupporter,,,"Exactly.  By way of example, the Texas Rangers recently signed a 20-year, $1.6b deal with Fox Sports Southwest[1].  That renewal happened four years <i>prior</i> to the expiration of the current contract.  Why?  To keep Comcast--who is trying to make a run for the Astros' TV rights--or Mark Cuban's HDNet from taking over.  Fox Sports can afford the huge payment because it collects money from cable MSOs, satellite providers, and telcos (FiOS and U-Verse both carry FSSW) in addition to advertising rates.  Over-the-air broadcasts are funded solely by ad rates unless the station has negotiated a retransmission agreement that pays, which most have, but at a lower rate than ""cable-only"" channels.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/bb/7220803.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/bb/7220803.html</a>",1287961076

That a memphis dry rub is completely different than the sweet stuff you get in the Carolinas, and still different yet from the stuff in Texas? I like these small differences between parts of the US.

Those things are: The outdoors, food, music, and idle chitchat. I think the US provides a lot of diversity in these things.

The music is blaring, it's good, and the crowd is going wild, intently staring at their feet, enjoying themselves.  Why do they do it?

Of course, I'm guessing since I haven't seen a copy of the order, and there's no record of the administrative proceedings on the public website, apart from a question at a meeting of the Taxi commission in September about whether or not the service is legal.<p>In any case, you shouldn't assume they've 'ignored' regulations simply because an agency has declared them not to be in compliance. Regulations are often poorly drafted or subject to conflicting interpretations; the applicability of a given regulation can also change over time because of court decisions or changes in other legislation which. Administrative orders are subject to an appeals process and judicial review, and initial determinations about what is or is not legal often turn out to have been made in error; generally, orders that mandate or forbid a given activity are placed on hold during the appeals process.

If you have a meeting, be there on time, if nothing time sensitive is on the calendar, then let people do what they find more productive, within reason off course.</i><p>The original poster is asking if punctuality is in general a measure of professionalism. I say generally no, but it can be in cases when punctuality is important. I said its a non issue on perhaps a greater percentage of the cases.<p>If I hire two developers and one has a knack on getting to the office an hour late every day while the other has a knack of being half an hour early; however the first is always on time with his work, while the second one is pushing deadlines all the time. My fuzzy feeling goes to the one that comes late every day.<p>In contrast if I hire a support line agent, and he's always late and because of it I have customers not being attended to I mark him as unprofessional and a liability.",1287958491

I'm about 15,000 feet from my CO, so the DSL I used to have was limited to 384kbps, and would flake out when it's hot.  Comcast provides something like 14Mbps, and is more reliable than DSL, but still not reliable enough for me to trust their phone service.  (I have kids; if I call 911, I want to be sure I'll get through.) I would consider getting unbundled IP from Comcast if it were available at a reasonable price, but it isn't, so I keep paying the $13.95/mo for my statutory minimum cable (just the stuff I could get over the air).<p>I sometimes get calls from Comcast, advertising their voice service.  One time I explained I needed something reliable; they told me they had 93% reliability.  And they seemed to think this was a <i>good</i> thing.",1287958469

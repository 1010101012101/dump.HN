It&#x27;s an anonymization proxy, which makes you a little harder to be &quot;snooped&quot; on by really anyone.<p>The EFF is suggesting people take additional steps, or everything they can to make the job of the NSA (or anyone else trying to snoop) that much more difficult.

If the startup gets bought out by the bigcorp, the bigcorp has wasted its well earned money and soon becomes a zombie. If the zombie folks instead join hands with the startup, they suddenly make pots of money & the startup become a bigcorp. Finally, if the bigcorp uses its cash prudently and buys the zombie, it starts innovating & becomes a startup.<p>So the claim is that if you let this economy play out in all its glory, there will be 1.448 billion buyouts. To arrive at this giant figure of 1,448,575,636 takes anywhere between 335 seconds for the C++ hacker to 7000 seconds for the JS guys.<p>Now give it your best shot!",1402026931

The age of perusing the belongings of dead people is past, for better or worse.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting thought that I have entertained as well, but at the same time, we have so many pictures/documents nowadays that virtually NOBODY is going to go through your files even if they can get access to them. We used to live with a few rolls of photo films used per year and maybe dozens of letters written, now we have thousands of emails every year, thousands if not dozens of thousands of pictures every year, there&#x27;s too much <i>noise</i> in the data to make it worth trying to find anything relevant.<p>As for photos, I know that I personally print out photo albums of the most worthy trips, and my guess is that this kind of stuff will remain, somehow, longer than the digital files.<p>Digital files&#x27; issues is not just about the format they are saved on. Will we be able to read IDE hardrives 100 years from now ? How about SCSI ? How about the formats we use nowadays ? Will the be completely obsolete and potentially unreadable 100 years from now ?

That is 5 years old, and that was a different Diesel framework.<p>Ok, same name (a cool one, I must admit), and I think same group of people. But, it did concurrency  differently. It used to be a yield based API. Which, funny enough, is like Guido&#x27;s latest Tulip/Async.IO approach. And it seems me they (Diesel) decided against it, and I 100% agree. Having yields in the library code, aside from demos and small examples, doesn&#x27;t work very well.<p>I think Diesel creators came to their approach from a practical standpoint. And I think Guido (and other proponents of async yield based IO) came from a purist/theoretical approach.  We&#x27;ll see what will happen in the future. It is hard to tell. But I don&#x27;t see yields everywhere as a good thing. Just like I don&#x27;t see callbacks or deferreds everywhere as a good way to do concurrency.<p>greenlet (the base module gevent and eventlet are based on it) is probably the best thing that happened to Python in its recent history.

Looking at back in the past at some point memory speed wasn&#x27;t that much slower than CPU speed (rather because CPU speeds were not that fast then).<p>So then throwing more memory at something seems like a very good way improve performance. Like say following long chains of pointers through some nested structure or long linked list was ok. At some point CPU speed went through the roof and left memory access speeds behinds.<p>So then caches became very important. Cache aware programming was a &quot;thing&quot;.<p>That, coupled with lots having virtualized/cloud machines everywhere that have limited memory kind of turned that initial thinking on its head. Small memory footprint became a desirable trait. Just like in the old MS-DOS & Turbo Pascal days.<p>Java sort of flourished and grew in that time period where &quot;throw more ram at it to get performance&quot; was a very obvious thing to do. Now I think it is less obvious that is the best way.<p>(And perhaps Java&#x27;s current or future GC and JIT strategies will start to take into account caches and memory frugality better).<p>Now that said I am still amazed at how it can achieve such great performance given all the stuff it does behind the scenes.

This is exactly the social cost I was talking about. Our society is run by people who can&#x27;t be bothered to compensate someone properly for curing cancer, but who will throw millions of dollars a year at someone for shaving a few microseconds off an HFT algorithm. That makes no sense to me.<p>Why are things this way? Lots of reasons, of course, but one of them is that, whenever anyone suggests that maybe it would be better if smart people were directed into more productive endeavors, the financial people have kittens and say it&#x27;s going to wreck the world&#x27;s economy if we don&#x27;t shave those few microseconds off the HFT algorithm, because there won&#x27;t be enough liquidity or something like that.<p>And <i>that</i> is bullshit. Sure, if we were at a point where all the big problems were solved, then yes, making tiny incremental improvements in the price of liquidity might be near the top of the priority list. But as things are, it should be somewhere around 56,732nd place. The problem to be solved is that there is huge, huge value to be captured by things like curing cancer, much, much more value than there is to be captured by shaving microseconds off HFT algorithms, but <i>nobody knows how to capture it</i>. How is making stock trading a fraction of a percent more efficient going to fix that?",1402024059

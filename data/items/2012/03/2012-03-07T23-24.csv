But I'm sure the alternative to Bootstrap for most people is for the developer to use his own html/css know-how to construct something passable as he goes.<p>So, for most people, I'd wager that Bootstrap is mostly just a time optimization that saves the developer from spending time on a design that would have been far less impressive anyways, that saves the developer from burning time that could be allocated to the actual product.<p>I find it silly to condemn people for how they allocate their time.<p>Even the whole pro-Bootstrap chorus of ""But it's just a standard interface for the web"" is silly.

Weekend solo-dev projects with funded business websites? I guarantee it.<p>The likening of Bootstrap to Wordpress' default theme is telling. Does anyone here really encounter WP's default theme in the wild? I sure don't. Maybe the majority of WP installs still have the default theme, but it's in the same way that the majority of WAMP installs still have the default ""It Works!""

If Bootstrap really was some prevalent interface that most of the web started using, then you guys that do have the crack team of designers at your disposal should be excited! Here's your chance to stand out! But I'm using Bootstrap because it's literally faster than any other alternative I can think of until I have someone separately working on a UI branch that I can merge into my code.<p>If I took your advice and stopped using Bootstrap because you assume ""I don't care enough"" to make a custom design, I'd end up with something that will probably look worse and guaranteed to take much longer to create giving me more bottlenecks as I get hamstringed by aesthetics when I could instead be funneling my efforts into business logic and not into something that's rather trivial to switch out when my app is deployed and my time frees up to address less-critical concerns.",1331162113

Also I suggested as a bonus, that they detect the OS from the browser and display the appropriate information. I assume, that I wasn't the only one asking for more detailed guidance. Funny enough, four hours later, they did the exact thing and notified me again via E-Mail. What a great response!",1331161275

It's particularly easy to scale if your app doesn't contain any state in and of itself - just spin up a few copies that point to your database (which you can also scale up with a paid provider like MongoHQ).<p>For an example, I have a single-server app running on Rackspace with a same-server MongoDB.  I pushed the web app to Heroku, now all I need to do is set up a connection to MongoDb (either via MongoHQ at $20-50/mo or with a hand-secured connection back to my existing database) and now I can stop worrying about Nginx and Apache and whatnot.  If my load grows I can spin up extra web server instances or increase the resources allocated to my DB server.",1331161265

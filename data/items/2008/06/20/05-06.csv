Your claims interest me and I'd like to subscribe to your newsletter, but the rubber will start hitting the road for me if this conversation progresses from accusations to evidence.<p>Here's an example of the kind of thing that interests me: a recent meta-study of FDA trials of SSRIs (antidepressants) showed little to no benefit over placebo, below statistical significance in some important cases. So there's a fair chance that most people shouldn't get SSRIs because they just don't work.<p>""Drug–placebo differences in antidepressant efficacy increase as a function of baseline severity, but are relatively small even for severely depressed patients. The relationship between initial severity and antidepressant efficacy is attributable to decreased responsiveness to placebo among very severely depressed patients, rather than to increased responsiveness to medication.""<p>Read it here.<p><a href=""http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045&ct=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-docum...</a>",1213941579

Proving that you can at least start will help fundraising immensely, and it's a long road.<p>2) Fundraising is a 3-6 month long process.  Start before you need it.  Angels are hard to find (especially in a non-hub), so start networking now.<p>3) You're talking about raising multiple rounds.  Common!  Angel, seed, series A, series B, etc. etc.  The first round investors get a better valuation for their dollar but will expect to get diluted in later rounds.<p>4) Original source may opt to not invest more in later rounds.  They retain the (diluted) ownership that they bought and generally have no special cash out options.  Oftentimes early funding is convertible debt (aka bridge loan).  Any investor expects a pay-out really only in a liquidity event (IPO or acquisition).  Most have a 3-7 year horizon.<p>In general, read:<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html</a>\n<a href=""http://venturehacks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturehacks.com</a>\n<a href=""http://www.askthevc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.askthevc.com/</a>",1213940862

Amazon is competing almost solely on price, and they're losing.<p>I think one of the reasons is that when something is that cheap already (99 cents), saving 10 or 20 cents doesn't look so attractive (even though, percentage wise, its actually pretty significant).<p>But it should be really clear to anyone who pays attention to iTunes that Apple is selling <i>way</i> more tracks than albums, so the fact that Amazon has cheap album deals means even less to most people.<p>The thing is, Amazon certainly had the capabilities to build a better (or nearly better, since they'll never be able to integrate as well on a website) store, but they didn't.  AmazonMP3's search feature, for example, works <i>much worse</i> than Amazon.com's.  They could have also done really great integration with Amazon.com, but instead they do next to nothing.<p>Apple definitely can't rest on its laurels (nobody can), but the fact remains that nobody has come close to building a better music store.",1213939667

As the author says, the VC-funded ""get big fast"" sites will face some major challenges going forward, since the market has proven itself transient and eager to move on when things take a wrong turn(the growth of news.yc is attributable mostly to refugees of other sites moving in), but those companies are really a sideshow to the main event, which is happening in little fits and starts and niches.<p>I feel that the real stars are usually operating fairly quietly, building on a primarily-open model rather than a walled garden, and creating strong businesses in a highly traditional fashion: by being the best around. (cue the Joe Esposio song)<p>You can still build a stable foundation on an open model if your company holds the expertise in the technology; your immediate competition is likely to be arrogant and compete in the sprint for the walled garden, rather than the marathon for the open model. (other companies working towards an open model are collaborators toward a standard, but competitors in services. Hardly an unusual situation.)<p>If the competition gets a lot of momentum in an inelastic product(for example, operating systems or instant messaging), that can kill you early on, but over the long term the most-open player usually becomes disruptive and causes the marketplace to expand with a new set of services. That is my observation of most such situations in technology.",1213939317

I'm not sure exactly whom I mean by ""all of these people,"" but there are certainly a lot of Mac users and Java programmers who are singing the praises of lightweight editors like TextMate when vim and emacs have been around for decades.<p>On the topic of vim, I highly recommend it for those who haven't tried it out. Sit me in front of vim and a unix terminal and I can quickly do any refactoring task that needs done. I have used vim macros to turn an HTML table into a C array in a few seconds.

One I just discovered today is Qliance, a low-cost version of boutique care, dubbed ""direct primary care.""<p>No insurance needed or accepted (thus no coding or paperwork), ~$50 a month, same or next-day appointments, 24hr access to care, they take their own xrays for free and dispense their own medicine at cost, &c.<p>Aside from making workloads managable (800 patients instead of 2-3000), the really interesting part is how this does away with the perverse incentives of insurance payments (which reward procedures rather than health, and which turns primary care into 10 minute referral-fests, rather than actual care), as well as sets up other good incentives, which reward the doctors for keeping the patient healthy (healthy patients don't need to spend a bunch of time in your office) and so on.

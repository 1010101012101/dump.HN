Its chief benefit is most likely forced self-pacing (and thus, forced concentration), but I highly doubt it will assist your comprehension. For one, it is ludicrous to read ""the quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog"" and ""scientists discovered more CP-violation than predicted by the standard model"" at the same speed. For two, this RSVP method obliterates benefits of peripheral vision. Sure, you can do several words at once, but PV does its job above and below the lines as well. For three, it eliminates any recall aids you might have acquired by the shape of the text (ever think, ""what was that word... it was at the left bottom corner of that page""?).<p>Otherwise, it's an interesting thing. I would play with that kind of stuff, but for experimentation.",1207543515

Sure, your eye takes time to move, but each saccadic jump takes less time (and is immensely precise with its jump, so it's a pretty optimized process) than that of text recognition to comprehension in your brain.<p>Peripheral vision serves as priming mechanism. You can better prepare your mind to piece together relevant words and form meaning, but don't expect it to support reading like the center of gaze.",1207543088

156661,comment,156464,156464,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Without claiming myself an expert in research on reading, and not a ""speed reader"" myself, I am probably able to deliver something of a lecture on this topic. Disregarding my lack of credentials, here's something you might find interesting in an unstructured manner. I apologize in advance for lack of sources; you can question me on anything I write, and I assure you there are sources but I won't bother digging.<p>Generally, proponents of speed reading don't know their stuff. Speed reading is based on the notion that the brain is underused in comprehending text; training would supposedly untap this potential. Don't count on it. Some say that if you read faster, you force your brain to focus, and so comprehension goes up. This works to an extent, noticeable, sure, but far less than hyped. And it is not a technique problem: it is a discipline problem. If you're generally focused at what you do, you're probably among the faster readers.<p>So most people read at about 250-400wpm, and this is related to the speed of the ""inner voice,"" aka ""subvocalization"" (or, better, the phonological pathway/loop). So the idea is that if you reduce, or eliminate the inner voice, you can read faster. Programs that focus on these will claim 1000+ wpm. There is some truth to this, but these programs aren't all it takes.<p>Now when your eye sees text, it the brain takes time to parse it and register meaning. Conscious meaning, IIRC, happens after a 350ms mark, which means it is biologically impossible to read word by word, line by line, beyond the speed of the inner voice. This means that if you want to read faster, you're reading in blocks of text .<p>What does this mean? It means that when a normal reader sees a word, you're seeing a sentence or paragraph. Peripheral vision? Not necessarily. Peripheral vision doesn't have enough acuity to support parsing at a level required for detailed reading. IOW, most of the peripheral vision talk by these programs is BS.<p>The cases where PV is useful is when you have good familiarity with the text contours. How do you train this? The hard way: build your vocabulary, and read a lot. Reading is a ""self-bootstrapped process,"" if you will. This is, AFAICT, the ONLY fool-proof, non bullshit method.<p>FYI, I recall two speed readers, who both read very fast but in different ways. First one reads blocks of text in a glance. He would see a paragraph and understand it in the time you read a sentence, in a kind of real-time, bulk-parsing process. The second one would read text in a ""serial"" fashion without regard to the meaning, into some kind of buffer, then think about it after he's done. The catch: both are geniuses.<p>The bottleneck in deciphering meaning from text is not at the text->parse stage (this is what SR programs focus on). It is from the parse->meaning stage. IOW, brain power. Fortunately you can train this, but probably not with some book or some program.<p>This is pretty thoughtstream. If you have other questions I'm happy to discuss.",1207542258

156652,comment,156464,156464,0,0,subwindow,,,"I used to work for a company that hocked speed reading training software.  As a kind of side effect, I learned how to speed read.<p>The thing with speed reading is that you can increase the speed at which you read fairly easily, but your comprehension and recall will suffer greatly.  I can probably read 500 words per minute, but comprehension is pretty low (~60%).  At that point, it generally isn't worth it.<p>Speed reading is kind of a stressful activity, and there's only a very narrow set of situations in which it makes sense to speed read something.  95% of the stuff that I read, I read for pleasure, and in order to enjoy reading something you have to read it the ""old fashioned"" way.<p>If you want to teach yourself to speed read, books and the like won't really help much.  It is kind of like learning to drive- you really have to just try it yourself.  To start, sweep your hand over the words in an ""infinity sign"" pattern, with the height of each sweep being about 3 or 4 lines high.  Don't read the words to yourself, just focus on the words above your finger.  After awhile, you'll be able to detach your eyes from the lines, and you can stop sweeping your hand over the page.  The key is to take in as much as possible with your eyes, and let your brain assemble everything in the background.  You'll eventually get pretty good at associating key nouns with the verbs and adjectives around them.  That's pretty much all you need to get 50-80% comprehension with most things.<p>(P.S. I'm not aware of any speed reading methods that don't come with a reduced level of recall/comprehension.  I think it is just the nature of the beast.)",1207541317

Of course, it would definitely be something, but I don't think it would be as useful.<p>Not to mention, the Netflix data has a scale of 1-5. Digg-like sites have scales from 0-1 (no vote, or vote), so that might further dilute the quality.",1207541283

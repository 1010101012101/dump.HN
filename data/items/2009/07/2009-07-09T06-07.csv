- Diabetes is chronic resistance to insulin; it is not ""taking insulin"". Diabetics gain weight not because of insulin, but because they are <i>resistant to insulin</i>, so the body is unable to properly break down food; more of it ends up being converted to fat so the body can try to break it down later.<p>- Fat is not an energy battery. Carbohydrates are for energy. Fat is for providing nourishment when food is not readily available, and for warmth.<p>- Damage from starvation is not to fat, it's to muscles. Muscles are high-maintenance tissues. If there aren't enough nutrients to maintain them, they break down. It only takes a day or two of fasting for this to occur; the longer the fasting period, the greater the damage.<p>- Weight management is about calories consumed versus calories expended. If you want to call that thermodynamics, so be it, but it demonstrates that you don't understand what thermodynamics is, or that you don't understand how the human body works.<p>- My science is medical science. It's backed by prevailing medical opinion. Hell, I made sure to check WebMD and various other medical sites to make sure i wasn't pulling it out of my ass.
It's very simple: eat more than your body can convert into energy or expel through various bodily functions, and that remaining mass remains in your body, as fat. Too much of that fat, and you have ""obesity"".<p>Puberty is red herring.  However, medical science has shown that puberty is triggered by the quantity of food one eats -- suggesting a mass trigger for puberty, which explains why fat little boys and girls hit puberty early, but gymnasts look like little girls into their 20s.",1247122745

695380,comment,694972,695333,0,0,Evgeny,,,"""Also, people still take insulin today and still gain weight from it.""<p>I'm wondering if it is possible to inject some insulin into a person, then put him on the scales (denying him any food/drink) and observe the weight increase. Obviously that is not possible.<p>What if we take a person, force him to do some exercise so that he loses 1kg of weight, and then provide him with food/drink that weighs 900g combined? Will this person gain weight over the initial amount?<p>What I'm trying to say, I think, is that while the simple calorie calculations may not be able to explain everything, surely weight increase can not come ""from nowhere"" without the abundance of food/liquid.",1247122602

695376,comment,695225,695363,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Not all.  Here's one example of where live streaming beats progressive download:<p>You are a website which serves an extraordinary number of videos, most of which are only viewed by a few users (e.g. Facebook).  A small percentage of these users want to view your video on an iPhone, so you re-encode it on the fly from the regular file on the website to display on iPhones.  In addition, this lets you adapt the bandwidth on the fly to maximize quality without the signal dropping out.",1247122220

695373,comment,695225,695363,0,0,drawkbox,,,"One other small factor is cost.  Lots of places go with streaming for cost, either to limit the amount of unnecessary download or to add in ads to pay for it (or limit streaming just to their site initially). For instance a live event especially where you want to make sure availability is the best situation it can be.  Also for larger movie files such as maybe on Netflix streaming is more cost efficient as lots of people stop watching or partially watch.  No need to download everything at .10 a GB for unwatched content.<p>Either way it sucks but it lives on due to market demands.",1247122169

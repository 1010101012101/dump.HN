3596755,comment,3596124,3596124,13,0,mattmaroon,,,"Humorous story: I once got yelled at by Teller. I was in Vegas for the World Series of Poker which was held at the Rio, the same casino where their show runs. The previous night I had had dinner at Okada with Penn's wife, Emily, who was a friend of the friend who put the dinner together. I also had tickets the next day to see their show for the first time.<p>On a break from my tournament I stopped by Starbucks to properly caffienate and saw Penn and Teller sitting in a corner. I went over to introduce myself, as I would to the spouse of anyone I had just met if I somehow recognized them. Right when I got there Teller gave me the evil eye and said something like ""Can't you see we're working here?"".<p>Of course they were just sitting at a Starbucks talking. They didn't have any props or anything. And probably they were hashing out details for the show or something, but I still found it quite rude, especially since I know they greet people outside of the show every night afterward.<p>But mostly I just thought it was funny to get yelled at by a guy most people think is mute.",1329350391

I don't regard it as hawkish to respond militarily to significant emergent threats or actual attacks. You are quite right aout LBJ and Vietnam, though.<p>My underlying point stands, I think: Obama has shown himself to be far more comfortable deploying military force than many expected, and has had several apparent successes; but Republicans still attack him frequently on national security issues, and will continue to do so given that it's an election year. He needs a fresh electoral mandate before he can propose dialing back the TSA or DHS in general.",1329350364

If you can distill something about the greatness you admire in a different art and adapt it to yours, then you will have accomplished something original. Study the masters, but especially the masters of other arts.<p>I wonder if the same could be said for software engineering. Maybe it's pretentious but I like to think of it as a practical art.

3596631,comment,3593775,3593775,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Title is wrong, this isn't 'laundering' its just fraud.<p>So the TL;DR version - App has a way to purchase virtual goods, app vendor 'sells' such goods but money from Apple at the end of the day doesn't add up to the number of goods they sold. Reason is that some of the 'sales' are contested by users which then result in charge backs and Apple returns the cash and deducts that out of what they send to the developer.<p>This sort of stuff will eventually kill 'in-app' purchases. The fraud rate is too high, the money too lucrative (which keeps the fraud rate high), the laws protect the consumer (that is good btw).<p>So the developer is left 'holding the liability' which is to say their virtual goods are 'stolen' and they don't get paid what they expect. Apple doesn't lose, the Credit Card companies don't lose, only the developer does.<p>So if you are looking for a startup idea, figure out a way to provide a remote 'kill switch' on virtual goods. Which is to say, from the developer's perspective if the purchase doesn't completely go through and stay valid, the item vanishes. That will kill the black market for such goods and return the problem to direct fraud vs the indirect fraud which makes it hard to fix.",1329348031

IP rights are for instance limited in time.  In fact, historically the original purpose of patents was to encourage inventors to disclose their information so that eventually it could be used by society at law.  Patents are inherently, and meant to be, self limiting.<p>Also, traditional property is normal inherently exclusive.  If I am using my hammer, you are not.  We may manage to come to a time-sharing arrangement or something similar, but only one of us is using it at a time.  On the other hand, my building a product based on a patent you hold is prevented only by the law, rather than by the mere fact of you holding it.  To quote Jefferson ""He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.

3596619,comment,3594108,3595140,8,0,dalke,,,"""An encyclopedia is a survey of existing secondary sources""<p>This is incorrect. The definition of encyclopedia has nothing to do with 1) primary vs. secondary sources, nor 2) a survey of said sources. Consider ""The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences"", which contains links to primary sources.  Consider the ""Encyclopedia of Physics"", which is certainly not a review of existing secondary sources. The ""Encyclopedia of Science Fiction"" (from the 1970s) contains new research and essays about the people and themes in science fiction.<p>""Encyclopedia articles are the worst way for them to address the public.""<p>When one of the first things that the public does is to consult Wikipedia, then a Wikipedia page is one of the best ways to reach people. If the information on the page conflicts with the primary sources, then the weight of the secondary sources should be diminished in favor of the secondary sources which are in agreement with the primary sources.<p>Your statement here is also wrong even on the surface. Stephen Barr (to pick one of many specific examples) is a researcher on grand unified theories, and he contributed the article on grand unified theories to the Encyclopedia of Physics. You saw elsewhere in this thread that Mandelbrot contributed the ""fractal"" article to Encarta. The Wikipedia page for ""Encyclopædia Britannica"" even says ""Britannica's authors have included authorities such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Leon Trotsky"".<p>Why would he or the other expert contributors have done that if doing so is the ""worst"" way to reach the public?<p>The obvious conclusion is that your views of how encyclopedias work is wrong, in that it does not agree with numerous real-world examples.

A robustly protected public utilities system is one of the reason the US is a first world country and Somalia is not. Hardin’s arguments lack any practical value. Can you imagine what an unregulated wireless spectrum would look like?<p>I've also never accepted the Coase Theorem because it too ignored the practical problem of ""whomever builds the tallest tower wins"". You simply can't build wireless network (or wired that have any practical use) without government control. Or, if you do, the market will work out a natural monopoly over time because of the need for standardization. It's the same reason it's so hard to break into the social network market, one platform is better and the larger it is, the better it gets. Imagine that extrapolated to something as economically essential as the telecomm system. We enable free markets by providing basic infrastructure (roads, telecom, etc.).<p>But that's getting off the topic of the discussion. The spectrum, in practice, is the property of the government and, by extension, the people. Wired networks are more complicated, but shared ownership is implied by right-of-way agreements, or at least the obligation to operate them in the public interest is implied. As long as that's true, governments are obligated to protect the public's interest in a free and open form of communication over those networks.",1329347017

This thing blew up huge, and it went off huge without a hiccup.  If you just hire some low-ball bidder who knows how to slap together some APIs what guarantee do you have that it won't crash and burn under load?  If that happens in seed-stage startup, oh boohoo, you disappointed your 100 early adopter friends, you learn from the mistake and you iterate, no experience necessary.  If you do it with a viral promo that cost you hundreds of thousands to produce you just threw 90% of your potential millions right down the toilet and you probably end up crawling back to your bitter paymasters who are not feeling particularly generous after being cut out of the last big deal.<p>You hire people who know what the fuck their doing.  No one here knows all the edge cases and planning that went into it.  It looks super simple, but that is the brilliance of it.  It looks effortless because it so well achieved.  It's disappointing to me that HN members would dismiss this as just combining a bunch of commodity components and calling it a day.  Just because you fancy that you could churn this out in a week of working 14 hour days with your buddy like you do for your startup doesn't mean that people doing this professionally shouldn't charge $250/hr to do it.  Remember, they have no upside, and should charge a proper fee for their expertise.",1329346992

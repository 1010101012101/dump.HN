28149,comment,27875,28041,0,0,machine,,,"A bit of semantics: what we are talking about here is the difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages, not strongly and weakly typed.  Python is strongly dynamically typed.  Java is strongly statically typed.  C is (arguably) <i>weakly</i> statically typed (because it let's you treat anything as anything through casts, void pointers, etc).<p>The point jey was trying to make is that only languages that are <i>both</i> statically typed and compiled can catch missing methods.  Consider for example a piece of code:<p>a.doB();<p>If the language is not statically typed, then the compiler does not know the type of ""a"" at compile time, and therefore doesn't know what class to check for method ""doB"".  This is why even if you were to compile python you would still end up getting missing method error messages occasionally.",1181843663

There's a balancing act between convenience to the caller and inconvenience to the callee.<p>The free text box in the profile lets the user give an email address, or their home page, or anything else including their phone number.  The point is, they can limit how you can contact them.  I don't think adding private messages on news.yc helps.",1181842983

It was a potential investor I had spoken too a couple of months ago, and yesterday out of no where they cut me a check.  It was the weirdest feeling.  I felt validated, optimistic, fearful, all at once.  I loved it.  For those of you who have received any type of funding for the first time from an outside source, did you feel the same?",1181841691

28136,comment,27890,28036,0,0,toffer,,,"What's interesting is that all the hype surrounding the explosive viral growth for Facebook apps such as iLike doesn't acknowledge a possible cost.  Acquiring 4 million users isn't strictly additive, if it comes at the cost of cannibalizing your existing Web site visitors.<p>At first, I thought that iLike would only be able to monetize their Facebook users by driving them to their Web site.  So, a big drop in Web site traffic seemed disastrous.  <p>However, I see now that iLike is showing ads on their ""Music Challenge"" page within their Facebook app, so driving traffic doesn't seem necessary.  (I'm assuming iLike is collecting this advertising revenue.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.)  <p>That's the real question then: How easy is it to monetize Facebook users?  Is a Facebook user (who never visits the iLike Web site) just as valuable to iLike as a Web site user?  If a Facebook user is less valuable, how many more Facebook users than Web site users would iLike need to come out ahead?",1181841538

The worst is ""fake vibes"", things constructed by corporations to look like collaboration and a good vibe that are really just manufactured. <p>It goes way beyond free food and ping pong. Is management on your side? Do they listen to your concerns and desires as an every day employee? Are you lied to regularly? Is everyone proud of their work? \n",1181841156

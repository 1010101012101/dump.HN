But at the edges, where you're accommodating the minds of users, inevitably it gets a little messy.</i><p>Absolutely. Your core code is usually targeted to programmers, that is, (hopefully) formally thinking folks, so you may choose to be as succinct as possible here.

Sure, Newsflip was a tiny site in the scheme of things, but if it switched it would set a dangerous precedent ...""</i><p>First chapter wasn't a bad read. Sarah sounds a bit too much like JT in Snowcrash on a hoverboard. But it was this paragraph that really peaked my interest.

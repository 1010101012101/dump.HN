Instead routes are loaded into special ASICs (TCAM: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_memory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_memory</a>) that seem to not follow Moore&#x27;s Law, be it due to low volume or other limitations (perhaps not technical).<p>Routers using TCAM seem to max out between 1-2M routes (divided across v4, v6, MPLS, etc). More recent routers are using slightly more flexible processors so there&#x27;s some hope but the router product cycle is fairly lethargic.",1392706789

Just look at the usability problems with Microsoft’s early attempts at UAC on Windows, or how many people give permissions for all kinds of things on auto-pilot when using mobile devices.<p>Still, you can’t start to educate even sensible, cautious users about how to make informed decisions if you don’t first have a robust technical security framework so you know what decisions need to be made. Also, we could tighten restrictions on applications without requiring any extra user understanding or interaction at all in quite a few useful cases.<p>For example, suppose we distinguished between installing general applications and system tools, with the latter meaning third party software that really does need unusual levels of access to system resources, such as security or disk management utilities. Suppose also that we restricted general applications severely in terms of low-level access to system resources. Now all a web browser or e-mail client has to do to benefit from improved security is initially install as a general application, which is presumably the default behaviour and requires no interaction with or notification of the user. Any malware that subsequently finds its way into that application and tries to access restricted system resources or APIs is assumed to be hostile and gets killed immediately, with no need for user interaction then either.",1392706517

The people doing this are thus called &#x27;Informatiker&#x27;. This alone helps, I feel, in making people understand that there is some degree of formal training behind it, that &#x27;Informatiker&#x27; aren&#x27;t just code monkeys. Granted, many still use the term Software Engineer today, simply because Engineer degrees have a higher entry barrier and thus have a better sound to them (you can get &#x27;Informatiker&#x27; degrees without a higher education by doing an 3-4y apprenticeship at 16, a very common way of how education works in Germany and Switzerland).<p>In any case I think that the English speaking CS pioneers have failed to coin a good term for their field - CS just isn&#x27;t right, especially regarding the English definition of &#x27;Science&#x27;.

I&#x27;ve always had a suspicion that the aim to make everything reusable for the sake of bite size actually has the opposite effect, as you have to start writing in support and handling tons of edge cases as well, not to mention you now have to write unit test so anyone who consumes your work isn&#x27;t burned by a refactor. Obviously, there&#x27;s a place for things like underscore, jquery, and boilerplate code like Backbone, but bringing enterprise-level extensibility to client code is probably mostly a bad thing.",1392706425

What you are describing is something more akin to the guilds system for craftsmen, which is not something I think you should aspire to or want to return to.<p>I imagine some part of software production will become codified and regulated in the same way in time - that part which deals with life or death situations or produces medical equipment for example. As software grows to eat the world this might start to encompass more of the profession, but probably there will always be a large area of software which just doesn&#x27;t matter enough to be codified and regulated (I&#x27;d include in that <i>most</i> of the work that companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, and web startups do - advertising or most websites can lose money when they go down, but it doesn&#x27;t risk lives). I&#x27;m sure you can think of a case where software risks lives, but the vast majority does not. So I don&#x27;t think this comparison is helpful.<p>As to driving up the cost of healthcare, try comparing countries and you&#x27;ll see costs are more related to the system of insurance and breadth of coverage than how much doctors are paid.<p><i>What is wrong with programmers? Are we simply too egalitarian for our own good?</i><p>Perhaps it is enlightened self-interest. The more people who know how useful software can be (if only in a small way), the more willing they will be to commission it. Monopolies of knowledge are easily undermined anyway, and why not try to improve the lives of others in a small way by encouraging them to automate filling in their spreadsheet or other daily tasks with a little scripting for example?<p>If you have sufficient experience or talent, lots of other people learning to code/program/engineer/whatever label you prefer should be the last of your concerns.",1392706404

But I am also finishing up my degree part time.<p>I got into the industry by doing an internship at Electronic Arts, and being offered to stay full-time, and they knew full well that I didn&#x27;t have a degree. I learned from some amazing backend engineers and architects, many of which had left EA shortly before I did. I can  pretty much go anywhere now without a degree, because the most important thing in the industry is on the job experience.<p>Though, I think the promise of me taking classes towards a degree helped me a bit. There are a few things I learned from the classes I took that I would have never learned on my own, at least I don&#x27;t believe i would have. And many are important to my job now. But I am a backend engineer so I feel the theoretical stuff I learned for the CS degree apply more than a frontend engineer.<p>Overall there are pros and cons to both approaches, but I could completely stop going to school right now and not be affected by it at all.<p>Another thing you have to take into account is career growth. Many managerial positions aren&#x27;t easy to get if you don&#x27;t have a degree of some sort. So you might eventually hit a ceiling with being just a programmer. Unless you get lucky to make your way up somewhere, get the Resume experience and then move.<p>Its not easy or black & white. But I know both have their pros and cons.<p>I currently have 0 debt, since I am able to make my $2500 payments per semster at SJSU for partime class load.<p>But I also have other circumstances, I still live at home, per my father&#x27;s financial suggestions, saving money for my own house (want to do a 20% down payment). This lets me splurge more than most, still cover school, drive a nice car, and so on. So everyone&#x27;s circumstances are different, you need to way all your options, all your responsibilities, and what you plan to do short and long term. Then make your decision.<p>I know I will get my degree in 1-2 years of what I am doing now. SO i will have that damned piece of paper that for the most part will be useless to me until i get into more managerial roles, and even then it probably won&#x27;t be as useful except get me into the interview.",1392705432

Maybe I&#x27;ll be completely wrong, but the odds are undoubtedly in my favor.<p>Second of all, you clearly didn&#x27;t read my post where I talked about Python being our new weapon of choice. We aren&#x27;t going to rewrite our legacy Java codebase in Python or something else because there is absolutely no need for it, and those codebases put the bread and butter on the table.<p>Third, when you&#x27;re running the company, you have to consider things from a business perspective rather than a technical one. I&#x27;m a developer myself so I understand technical details and limitations, but my first question about the product is &quot;does it work?&quot;. Nobody is going to give two shits what language or optimizations you used for a product if it doesn&#x27;t work. They aren&#x27;t going to pay you a dime, either.<p>Your comment really exemplifies my point, that people do nothing but sip the Java haterade without realizing what it is good for. Honestly I couldn&#x27;t care less- I&#x27;m not trying to change your way of thinking, and based on your radical assertions that Java is dead, neither are you.

In extreme cases, making the request can be as uncomfortable as having to reapply for a job you&#x27;ve already got.<p>In a well-run shop, managers have a very good idea as to who is worth what, and how much the company stands to lose if they lose good people. Staying one step ahead of this curve is a fundamental part of their jobs as a managers.<p>Obviously, the rules are a bit different in an early-stage start-up where the founders are doing everything at once and hoping something connects.

For any normal application, it should not even be possible to read system-level information like what is cached within the networking stack, or to hide funny things in your file systems or mess with your boot sector, or to monitor and/or interfere with communications between other applications and the OS.<p>However, on a typical laptop/desktop/server OS today, we still usually determine authorisation at a resolution marginally finer than “Are you root?”. On some mobile platforms, there seems to be a move toward a more controlled and application-specific model. However, in practice, apps frequently ask for everything including the kitchen sink anyway, and the more controlled installation/update/removal processes for apps seem to be more a (possibly unintended) side effect of locking users into app store models than an active decision to firewall each application for security reasons.<p>So, out of genuine curiosity: Is anyone actively researching better ways to model user and application permissions that might find their way into mainstream operating systems any time soon? By now, I really ought to be confident that even if I were silly enough to open a dodgy attachment in my word processor, it couldn’t then scan my e-mail, load a couple of juicy system settings files, and upload it all to a server in Western Hackville without further permission. And if I have a problem with a particular piece of software, I really should be able to summarily destroy every trace of it with a simple and reliable procedure, without having to worry that it’s left anything behind that I didn’t want. We’ve obviously got tools that do parts of this job, such as chroot jails and checkinstall in Linux world, but for the average user this whole area seems absurdly underdeveloped given how many common attack vectors would immediately be closed down entirely or at least much better contained.",1392703557

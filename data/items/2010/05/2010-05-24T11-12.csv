1374356,comment,1373929,1374335,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Clarification: you don't need an object to do OOP.<p>Here's a wonderful example. Let's say you're in C. You start writing code and continuously refactor as you go along. What most people find is, after a good bit of coding and refactoring, you end up with code grouped in modules with public and private functions, public and private data, etc. You can have data abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance -- all to varying degrees, depending on the problem and solution.<p>OOP takes that categorization and set work and makes it part of the language. But programming in objects -- true OOP - does not require a language that provides objects. In fact, it's the other way around: because people programmed in objects, languages started providing that capability. Where folks get lost in the woods is where they think the language features are OOP instead of the conceptual work. Languages are just varying levels of syntactic sugar on top of the core tools.<p>Hope that clears it up for you",1274701179

There are some topics on HN that are just starting to bore the hell out of me. Apple fanboy-ism, or not. C++: it's complicated so it's bad. Famous person X says this about famous person/product Y. And bitching about OOP.<p>Look. OOP is just the use of categorization and set theory to organize code and data. It doesn't have to involve a lot wiring things together, it doesn't have to mean tremendously huge class diagrams before coding, and it is absolutely not related to one particular language. I can use OOP techniques in any language, and to the degree they're necessary, I should. It's just a tool.<p>I understand that the OOP <i>movement</i> got way overblown and annoying, but we as technologist are always making overly-broad generalizations of anything we do. There's a tremendous amount of selection bias that goes on in technology, most of it hidden. I remember in one of my early contracting jobs we had a PM who was a FoxPro programmer. No matter what the problem we were talking about, somehow he would feel that FoxPro was the best answer for that problem.<p>At the time I thought he was unique -- sort of a joke. Looking back over many years of observing technologists, however? He was the rule, not the exception. At the risk of stating the obvious we only understand those things we have familiarity with. This means if you haven't programmed in OOP, <i>or if you've had extensive experience with OOP and you know somebody at the same experience level with different opinions</i>, you should try very hard to have an open mind and learn something from somebody else. It's very easy to make broad claims that are unsupported by anything but a small set of observations.<p>Saying ""Are we still doing OOP?"" is like saying ""Are we still using categorization and set theory"" which sounds to me a LOT like ""Are we still using arithmetic?""<p>The question is nonsensical.",1274700165

Something like ""1000 users, 24/7 assistance"" with a really high price. Or something less. However, I think that you should be able to offer also something ""high end"". Think about restaurant menu design: the highest priced item isn't almost ever bought, but it raises the bar for everyone else. It's a matter of perception. Of course, you must be able to satisfy that high-end request, so if you can't do 24/7 assistance I don't mean you should still add it. :)<p>Freemium: I agree on your positions. Just maybe think of a small, really small solution that could be free forever. This one is also a matter of perceptions. If you hurry me with 30 days of testing, I think twice before subscribing, since I need to do that at a time when I'm going to have 30 days of test time. Otherwise, I'll just subscribe and I'll test it when I can. Some days of full trial and then put on free is a good solution imho.",1274699588

That says a lot about the hype surrounding it, since that's essentially the app you got when you pasted their sample code into your IDE and hooked it up to a database.<p>Today, it's just expected that any application you build will have a GMaps implementation somewhere in it, but it's just old-hat.  I actually run one of those GMaps-based startups from back in the day, and I haven't kept up on the latest API changes for years.",1274699121

One re-write was a success both technically and commercially, the other was a near complete disaster.  Four of the re-workings are still underway and the product has remained live, sellable and profitable the whole time.  The fifth is under constant review, but is not a disaster.<p>So re-writes can work, but the experience is that they usually don't.

1138962,comment,1136643,1136943,0,0,rms,,,"Those causes are certainly sympathetic to anarchism, but I'm pretty sure that the early 20th century anarchists really were anarchists. They were pretty open about their goals; just like the people we currently call terrorists.<p>Libertarian socialism is now the most polite label for the anarchist political philosophy. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism</a> I prefer to call it left libertarianism.",1266670154

1138959,comment,1138870,1138897,0,0,hga,,,"Well, that's because it appears to be based on spying that the plaintiff claims mistook candy for drugs.<p>But I'm sure that child porn is firmly in the background: if or more administrators were abusing the web cam feature such that they saw the above, you know they'll have been seeing students without all their clothes on (or likely at least this student, if it just so happens this was the only spying incident and it was based on a prior report of his doing drugs or whatever).<p>Sounds like a situation that calls for some small pieces of tape to cover the built in camera and mike.",1266669540

If forensics turns up salacious pictures, along with inept cover ups that demonstrate intent, <i>then</i> the fishing expedition starts.  Depending on how out of control the school was, the Feds could end up with an open-ended fishing expedition into staff home computers and a warehouse full of evidence.",1266669329

When it started its back-end was technically atrocious, written in a big pile of php spaghetti on Zuckerberg’s subnotebook, its front-end had barely any features, and it crashed all the time.<p>But it didn’t really matter, because the user base was in the thousands for quite some time, and then organized in a school-by-school way that let them easily handle the load by throwing hardware at it.<p>Then within a year or two, they had more money than they knew what to do with, and could hire people to do a nearly complete back-end rewrite.",1266668309
1138952,comment,1138724,1138791,0,0,randallsquared,,,"To be clear, these Mac Minis are running regular OS X, not OS X Server.  I bought one of these back when they first started, using PPC Mac Minis, and everything was as advertised.  My motivation at the time was basically just to see if there were any major advantages to using OS X on the server, over Linux (I was using and still use CentOS and Debian on other servers).  I didn't really find any such advantages, so after the contract was finished, I had them send me the Mac Mini.",1266668286
1138951,comment,1138677,1138727,0,0,hga,,,"Agreed with the former although it was mostly in passing, but I suspect a lot of the latter will be abrogated.  How long with the public sector unions be able to get people making e.g. 40K to keep sacrificing to keep people making e.g. 80K fat and happy?  SS and Medicare are bigger problems, but are in part amenable to adjustments at the edges (e.g. raising the retirement age).<p>I give this higher marks for the emphasis on including state and local governments when scoring the US deficits.<p>At a macro level this is important ... although as a resident of a state and local governments that are in fairly good fiscal shape, have balanced tax policies (i.e. not too much from the extremely variable incomes of ""the rich"" or from any one tax source), etc., it's not clear how much e.g. California's Greece like behavior will affect me.",1266668236

1138949,comment,1137669,1138633,0,0,lsc,,,"No.<p>It just means that it will be quite difficult to find people who will hire you without going through a headhunting firm that will take half your pay, and that if you do manage to find a small corp that will hire you directly as an independent contractor, and you write off business expenses against that income, there is a chance the IRS will invalidate those writeoffs, which often results in big debit that can't be discharged by bankruptcy.",1266668218

(same goes for any platform agnostic runtime - java, js, lua, python, ...) There aren't that many languages that are really system-dependant. Conversly, many ""Linux apps"" written in C/C++ will compile and run just fine under Haiku or Mingw - does that make them BeOS or Windows apps?<p>It seems that ""(Linux|Windows|Mac|BeOS|whatever) app"" doesn't have the same meaning today...",1266668034

I&#x27;m a CloudAtCost customer, paid for their $35 one-time fee because I figured it would be nice to not have to worry about yet another recurring payment (however small) for stupid things like having a Linux machine to test new apps on and run my IRC bouncer. When they had some downtime, they did alert us but I didn&#x27;t find out my server had failed to power back on until I opened my laptop one day and couldn&#x27;t connect to IRC. Given their impossibly-low prices[1] and lack of history in our community, I&#x27;m probably always gonna be a little paranoid that my server is just going to die one day and there&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;ll be able to do about it.<p>That said, I think OVH is in a similar boat. Crappy customer service, but low prices, so my advice for anyone wanting to take a gamble on this is to definitely NOT host anything important on these low-cost VPS services. They&#x27;re really best for staging and light internal use, and they&#x27;re not to be trusted with the architecture of your whole company.<p>[1]: CloudAtCost is essentially a big Canadian ISP&#x27;s server hosting brand. Basically, their parent company owns the datacenter they&#x27;re hosting you in, so the service they&#x27;re offering is practically cost-free to them. If this is true, the money they get from you must be 100% profit, or they wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep themselves in business.

7455115,comment,7454437,7455004,13,0,msandford,,,"> No normal lender would give an 18 year old $50,000 to get a degree in anthropology, because they are unlikely to get it back. When the student is legally obligated to pay it back, then there is much little risk to the lender.<p>I think the argument goes like this:<p>1.  Allow college debt to be defaulted on<p>2.  After some time the government (or banks) will start to assess the risk of making student loans<p>3.  Some time after that the loan market for students will be less crazy and more rational<p>4.  With enrolled students able to spend less, colleges will be forced to charge less or lose students<p>5.  Some college close, others stay open<p>6.  College now costs a more reasonable amount of money<p>We&#x27;re seeing the same dynamic in the college market as we saw in the housing market.  The banks were typically in the business of saying &quot;no, you can&#x27;t do that&quot; to people who were borrowing money, thus enforcing restraint on those who didn&#x27;t have enough on their own.  Once the banks stopped saying &quot;no&quot; when people were not a good credit risk, everyone went nuts and bid housing up to rather crazy levels.  Housing prices are inversely proportional to interest rates in a very nonlinear way.<p>The situation is similar in the college market.  The interest rates are more sane, but the risk assessment is much worse.  There&#x27;s all kinds of loan money sloshing around and not a tremendous amount of out-of-pocket money.  If college had to be paid out of pocket you&#x27;d see lower enrollment or lower prices or both.  Allowing defaults will force the market from largely loan-funded to a more reasonable mix of loan and out of pocket funding.",1395608136

It was repetitive, inconclusive, and far longer than the material merited. I came away thinking Wolfram must have set some kind of record for use of the personal pronoun &quot;I&quot; in a book, including autobiographies.  The egotism shines through that much.

The chart in the blog post starts at 1980, showing that you could work 10 hrs and pay for a credit-hour of tuition. But remember, 1980 was the end of the financially disastrous 1970s. The 80s and 90s were boom decades, so parents with money in the markets were increasingly able to pay for college for their kids. This added to the demand side of the equation, along with the easy money in loans and grants, to cause the explosion in tuition.<p>You&#x27;re also right about the buildings and staff bloat.

They would submit one screen then work on something else.<p>Eventually, the agency spent an enormous amount of money implementing some combination of systems from SAP to consolidate / replace everything.<p>Now the same folks who were retyping resumes are cut and pasting them into a series of webforms and emailing around spreadsheets of all the information that the system lacks forms for.<p>Hiring managers who had little or no input on requirements for new system don&#x27;t even log in, they request printouts from HR.<p>---<p>Having seen things like this play out a few times now I have a few ideas about what could help one of these projects actually succeed:<p>* Generate or at least inform requirements with honest information from people at the ground level. Those people toiling away filling up manilla folders and doing data entry know the actual process. The farther up the chain you go the story will move away from reality toward what&#x27;s effectively nothing more than the way things are supposed to work.<p>Problem is, the layers of management don&#x27;t want to allow that kind of access and will retaliate against their subordinates for being honest. Also, those low-level people are likely aware enough to know that they&#x27;re talking themselves out of a job.<p>I think the former requires a powerful and attentive enough personality leading the effort to simply bulldoze the managers. I wonder if the latter can&#x27;t be addressed by  buying everyone out with generous severance or early retirement. It would puts a cap on the cost of these broken jobs and processes rather than continuing to cycle people ad money through them.<p>* As a rule, the technical and procurement staff of these agencies aren&#x27;t competent to generate requirements or evaluate what&#x27;s produced when dealing with outside contractors and implementers. At the same time, the agencies don&#x27;t pay enough or move fast enough to maintain a competent internal staff.<p>This is really hard. Hiring outside experts seems to actually work against the goal as they will invariably work more for some particular vendor than the agency.<p>Big companies absolutely collude and actively work to hold down smaller competitors so &quot;competitive&quot; anything doesn&#x27;t really work.<p>One idea I&#x27;ve been kicking around is a sort of a open source template for government system/project requirements. It would be a easy to follow &quot;test suite&quot; which proposals could be compared against. It would raise flags or fail plans and terms which don&#x27;t meet the standard of contributors with domain knowledge.<p>I&#x27;d like to write more on this, but I&#x27;ve got a few things to handle this evening.",1395607785

And yes, naturally once I was a declared CS major I could intern at IBM, but even before that I didn&#x27;t see a need to work minimum wage.<p>(Even McDonald&#x27;s was paying more than minimum in my area.)",1395607581

7454995,comment,7452773,7454034,2,0,Silhouette,,,"Looking at the replies to my previous post, I&#x27;m guessing my choice of words had connotations for some readers that I didn&#x27;t intend. My point was merely that a lot of the people arguing for high tax rates for above average earners today seem to be doing so in the belief that they will be collecting more money from the super-rich, whom they regard for whatever reason as being legitimate targets. However, the reality is that it&#x27;s usually not the bankers with million pound/dollar bonuses or the pop stars flying to their concert on a private jet who are ever going to be paying those rates, because they all have sufficient mobility to escape the high tax rates by moving their assets and/or themselves elsewhere. So, I think it&#x27;s more likely to be those who are significantly wealthier than average but <i>not</i> super-rich who get hit by these rates, and many of those people are self-made <i>and</i> the lucky ones.<p>For example, while I&#x27;m not an expert on French taxation, I know that in the UK right now there is considerable debate about a 40% marginal tax rate for those earning above the higher rate threshold, because that threshold has been steadily reduced in real terms to the point where unlike the situation when that rate was first introduced, today quite a few people working full time in ordinary professional jobs would get caught in that bracket. (For context, with the latest tax bands and income levels, well over 4M taxpayers will be caught in that bracket, from a total population approaching 64M.)<p>Then there&#x27;s a marginal 60% rate for a while when you hit £100k, which is certainly a very nice salary to be earning, but at a little over three times the national average it&#x27;s hardly super-rich. It does cover the senior positions in some professional and executive management roles, but it also catches the entrepreneur who takes a couple of years of very low salary (forfeiting their ability to take more salary at lower marginal tax rates, of course) and then makes good on their business and is able to draw a larger salary the next year.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in what people in different relatively well-paid professions really earn, you might find this helpful; it looks like being a doctor or a pilot is a promising option if you don&#x27;t fancy the management path:<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/18/what-are-the-best-paid-jobs-uk-2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/18/what-are-the-be...</a><p>In short, I believe a lot of people don&#x27;t think much of the super-rich, and they would be happy to see them get dinged for more tax. Sometimes there is some objective justification for this, but if anyone reading this thinks there&#x27;s really no envy involved, I&#x27;ve got a nice second hand car to sell them. In any case, a lot of the people keen on the higher tax rates probably don&#x27;t realise who is really going to wind up paying them, and how little effect they really have on the super-rich.",1395606599

One of the things I appreciate about C++ is that iterator invalidation is very precisely specified. Sadly, that&#x27;s where it stops: it&#x27;s just specified, but the onus is still on you to catch the errors. It&#x27;d be great to have that same thing: immediate errors when you use an invalidated iterator. (in vectors, it might just skip an element (some deletes) or see the same element twice (some inserts); Python warns about this during some cases with dicts:<p><pre><code>  RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration\n</code></pre>\nwhich is nice, but I think you can still slip by that.) I don&#x27;t believe Java or Python specify what happens to iterators when the collection changes, which to me, is a bit sad.<p>Thing is, to implement this, the collections would probably need to know about all outstanding iterators, so as to figure out where they are and whether they should be invalidated at all. Most operators then become O(number of active iterators + whatever the normal cost of this op is); I&#x27;d argue this might still be close to O(1 + ...) since the number of active iterators on a collection is probably usually 0 or 1. But there&#x27;s a memory cost, a CPU cost, and if you have something like:<p><pre><code>  if(weird condition) {\n    use_that_iterator_i_just_accidentally_invalidated()\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThen your bug only gets caught if `weird_condition` is true. Is it worth it?",1395605204

5066027,comment,5064058,5065234,2,0,pseingatl,,,"I haven't seen the Granick analysis. But it's easy to do the guidelines calculation. The base level for fraud is 6, and there is an 18 level enhancement when the amount in question is between 2 and 7 million dollars, as the government claimed. That yields, with no criminal history, a guideline level of 24 and a sentence of 57-71 months if there were no other enhancements. There almost always are. You can drop 2 levels if the defendant ""accepts responsibility"" which may or may not have happened. There would be 2-3 years of supervised release (no computer) and a fine within statutory limits. The danger with multiple counts is that the sentencing judge may decide to impose consecutive punishments which would exceed the guideline range. In this particular case, which, make no doubt about it, was a political case, Ortiz' office might seek an upward departure because of the defendant's lack of remorse, the PACER incident, and a perceived ""danger to the community.""",1358326713

That was really the nail in the coffin.<p>All in all, they're just document stores, and those are more popular than ever now with the whole NoSQL thing.\nAs the author mentions, XML seems to have won out as a document format...

Programmatic layout takes longer to setup the boilerplate, but once it's in place, I find it about as easy to work in code as nibs.

The rape statute you quote expressly says that the 9-13 years you quote is stacked on top of the general crime of sexual assault of a minor:<p>>> This subdivision does not preclude prosecution under Section 269, Section 288.7, or any other provision of law.<p>>> 269:  Any person who commits any of the following acts upon a child who is under 14 years of age and seven or more years younger than the person is guilty of aggravated sexual assault of a child [statute lists all conceivable forms of sexual gratification] ... Any person who violates this section is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for 15 years to life.<p>Section 288 adds yet more penalties for using force, being in a position of trust, etc.<p>You keep using examples of ""hackers get stronger penalties than these other crimes"" (bank robbery, child rape), but the other crimes consistently have life in prison as a maximum sentence if you stop to read the full context of the law.",1358323341

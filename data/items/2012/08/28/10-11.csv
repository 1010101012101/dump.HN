In about a week I end up doing much more than what would have been on my long term list, and that boils down to the list never getting done and me getting frustrated at the process. But we definitely have something similar to your Trello bucket for 'future enhancements' or 'quick-wins' that we'd like to complete within the next 3-4 iterations, or 2-3 months, etc.<p>Daily todo lists have always been a value to me, but I rarely have to actually write them down because of work order tickets or bugfixes semantically being the same thing (to me).",1346151595

4442990,comment,4441903,4442723,3,0,scott_w,,,"I like to apply a few different methods to developing web applications:<p>I write unit tests to ensure the correct data comes out. This usually involves doing a quick ""get a blank page loading"" bit of boilerplate, then putting the tests (and required data) in place. This involves a fair bit of discussion, sitting down with a calculator, and drawing on the whiteboard. Then I write the code to pass the tests.<p>In parallel, the screens are being designed and put up on our wiki. Once this is done, I'll make the screen look like the mock-up, which involves a visual ""test"".<p>For more complex stuff, this is done in a more piecemeal fashion, although the design is usually put in place in one go. What I'm working on right now has involved 4 iterations of this so far.<p>For what it's worth, writing the tests first forces you to make your code easier to test which, for a web app, is incredibly useful. I've seen some web applications developed without testing in mind, which tend to have the effect of ""funnelling"" the user through specific steps. They tend to get a little fragile when the user inevitably steps outside the narrow corridor they're pushed down.",1346151245

You should be writing a test that checks for the existence of that specific html, then watching it fail, then writing the HTML.<p>If you think that's wrong, then 'test first' isn't always the 'right way'.<p>No, I'm not being facetious or sarcastic.  Just pointing out that 'test first' isn't a requirement.  It's an approach that has some good points.  I 've done portions of some projects 'test first' and they generally turn, but it's not an approach I use exclusively 100% of the time.<p>""If you start by writing code you'll end up with the UI that was easiest to code rather than the UI that looks how the end user will want it to.""<p>The problems with this thinking (which I <i>mostly</i> agree with, btw) is that not every project gets to involve checking with end users, nor do end users really understand what/how something should work until they're using something that actually allows a degree of interactivity.  They may not even be aware of what's <i>possible</i> until they're poking around 'live'.  While you <i>might</i> be reluctant to rejigger large portions of what you've done to move toward ""easiest to code vs what they want/need"", that's a different problem.

4442867,comment,4441868,4441868,1,0,hdivider,,,"I'm quite suspicious about messing around with sleep too much. If you get up early, you'll eventually have to go to bed earlier, too. (Though apparently there's no 1:1 relationship between sleep debt that you have to repay and time you spend being awake when you should be sleeping - you only have to make up a fraction of that sleep.[1])<p>The >only< sleep hack that seems to work (and I've tried many) is the 15-20 + coffee nap. You know how it is: you wake up, and for the next few hours tons and tons of distractions present themselves (and I don't mean trivial stuff like Twitter or emails and such). Eight hours or so pass, and you've only managed to deal with tedious administrative stuff or other non-critical work that won't count in the long run. By that time you're usually dead tired - so the trick I use is to have a normal-sized coffee really quickly, then nap for 15-20 minutes or so (not much less and certainly not much more). The effect of the coffee kicks in right when the effect of the extra sleep kicks in, and if you don't sleep too long you won't get the usual 'exhaustion' that comes from lengthy sleep.<p>This trick has worked for me every single time (except when I was severely sleep deprived). It may not feel productive to have a nap when you should be working - and obviously it's not possible for everyone to do this - but I've personally found the extra energy and focus that you get invaluable.<p>[1] ""Sleepfaring"" by Prof Jim Horne: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sleepfaring-Journey-through-Science-Sleep/dp/019922837X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1346148161&sr=8-1&keywords=sleepfaring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Sleepfaring-Journey-through-Science-Sl...</a>",1346148566

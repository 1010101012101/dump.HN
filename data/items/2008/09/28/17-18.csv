It is a construct granted because of other dependent bodies of law, including taxes, health care, child custody, property rights.<p>Without marriage laws to assist, it is more difficult to have our courts administer the other dependent laws.  You are therefore denying gays equal access to the legal system and its protections as a result.<p>You have the right to believe in whatever you want.<p>You do not have the right, in MY country, to deny other human beings rights or protections that others have.<p>Go to church all you want.

I think it would be intresting to measure rightness and wrongness on a weekly basis. Like this week, 70% of the were correctly called. You could determin something along the lines of, people who pick NFL games, are better then those who pick NCAA. If this is just a side project, you could get people to do the meta analysis by providing an api, or do dumps of the data the people can download and process.

317695,comment,317610,317610,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Interesting. It is a little unclear to me from this article the nature of the discrepancy between the predicted strength of the gravitomagnetic field from general relativity and what the researchers claim to be observing. Whence the increase in strength in the gravitomagnetic field from predictions? Is it an effect from quantum theory? Maybe the article just doesn't go into detail enough, but seems to me either there needs to be a satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy, or, what they are observing is not the gravitomagnetic field.",1222623085

If you're counting the total number of households that own the product, you can double your count by doubling the population, or by convincing everyone to divorce and become two households.

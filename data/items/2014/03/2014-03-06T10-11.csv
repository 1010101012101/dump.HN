The Stasi were famous for the massive amounts of surveilance and they would have loved the capabilities that the NSA had. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the results of political opposition in the US are the same as they were in East Germany but East Germany was one of the experiments in the effects on observers and the observed in a mass surveilance society and we should at least look to it for lesson and warnings.<p>[0] I know that there were always flaws but the aspiration was there.<p>[2] I&#x27;m from and in the UK and I make no claim that we are better in general, while in some ways it feels less corrupt and politically broken than the US sometimes seems we don&#x27;t bother to restrain GCHQ at all.",1394103169

Maybe I&#x27;ve gotten old or maybe I&#x27;m hopelessly out of touch with mainstream culture but two things in particular alienate me (and my friends):<p>1. The need to somehow shove god into everything. Vocal religiousness makes me (and I think many Europeans) quite uncomfortable.<p>2. Pornographic celebration of violence contrasted with ridiculous prudishness. One of the children&#x27;s movies (or maybe &quot;family&quot; movies) I watched when I was a kid had female toplessness in it. Judging by the late effects, today, decades later, I can tell you that this causes absolutely zero problems. Neither does male nudity. But today, whenever I go to the cinema, I must be prepared to see people being hacked to pieces, which is IMO totally fucked up. Not that I have any problem with violence in movies, but why does it have to be _every single one_ of them? I mean Pirates of the Caribbean 2? That is a movie made for children by Disney. Why does it start with explicit scenes in a torture prison?<p>I have, however, observed one positive trend, which is the growing willingness of television series producers to take a more relaxed stance towards nudity.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just getting old and grumpy.

7352928,comment,7352480,7352925,1,0,thenerdfiles,,,"PIII.<p>Now.<p>I&#x27;ve recently found myself having committed a drunken act with someone else by the same first name who was also drunk. Of course this statement of drunkenness does not justify my actions. You could say this act was wreckless. You could also say that it was motivated by some latent sexist urge. It was in fact my set of actions that brought it about. Some people have suggested that I am a sociopath, people who hardly know me. It started off as a miscommunication which turned into me becoming overly excited and reaching for more than was consenually agree in a moment of ecstasy. I hurt a person, to whom I have given apologies — and who has pardoned my actions on multiple occasions. She said &quot;I just want things to be normal.&quot; This is not a paraphrase. It was a second-night stand that this happened, with a girl I found incredibly charming.<p>However, one friend of hers who caught the news made a very interesting assumption of me. He accosted me with the assumption that I was a porn addict, and had confessed that he too had given up porn, years ago. I immediately responded by showing him a porn app I briefly collaborated with a friend on. One of the main purposes of the porn app was to show that porn can be curated through small-network algorithms such that the &quot;extreme&quot; fetish stuff is eliminated by default in virtue of democratic principles. His response was &quot;I cannot believe you&#x27;re showing me porn right now.&quot;<p>Now.<p>It just so happens that I&#x27;ve never really been interested in fetish porn, and that I find &quot;extreme&quot; sexual activity deplorable. Pedophilia, deplorable. Rape is absolutely repugnant to me. Rarely I&#x27;ve looked at hardcore porn, but it&#x27;s almost always with curiosity — I usually find myself in a reflective mood, knowing full well that this is staged. And sometimes it completely ruins my mood if I download some clip that goes just a notch over my personal threshold. What I find most surprising in myself is that I do not throw all of porn out on account of these offenses, and I do, and always will, consider them offenses. I become angry with myself, surely, and sometimes such offenses have compelled me not to view porn for weeks on end, if I find something distasteful — because I clicked on a thumbnail that led to a scene that is stronger in content than I would prefer. Do I ban the whole porn studio&#x27;s/producer&#x27;s material? Well, I <i>never actually</i> commit myself to porn beyond downloading maybe 10-20 clips and then deleting them afterwards. I&#x27;m <i>that</i> kind of downloader.<p>Digressing again. I have always found myself on the &quot;libertarian&quot; side of things, having marched with social justice groups, argued in defence of feminism, argued religiously against arguments like &quot;child prostitution as an economic alternative to child labor&quot;. I find such reasoning sickening. I agree with John Stuart Mill that nothing in our institution of law can grant women any powers that nature has not already given, nor should we legislate against women. I believe women are fantastic, and I actually grew up with only that single Baptist mother (though she did bring abusive men into our home now and then in my youth). I am the type of person who independently of any of this has stuff like The Categorical Imperative committed to memory — along with Kafka poems and various philosophers on ethics. I just happen to be a Spinozist.<p>This may seem like a lot of coincidence, but I don&#x27;t care. Is child porn on the same level as adult porn? Is it all &quot;just prostitution&quot;? I don&#x27;t know the answer to these questions. But I do know something from a personal vantage: Did porn bring it about that I hurt someone, and is the view that it&#x27;s &quot;prostitution&quot; actually relevant to peoples&#x27; complicated lives that can be directed and compeled by a multitude of factors? I maintain that the view that &quot;porn is not the problem, we are&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m saying this in the face of someone, Gavrieli, is who making broadstrokes about an industry, completely ignoring gay porn and softcore and roleplay — in the face of someone who seems to be pinning a lot on an industry, when I know from personal experience, that porn didn&#x27;t make me hurt anyone. I was hurt, and I just so happen to be male. And I just so happened to do something that, when put into conversational form, shared as such, turns into a &quot;regular porn result.&quot; When that is just not the truth. I will personally admit that I hurt someone, but porn had nothing to do with it. And I strongly believe that the way people like Gavrieli say &quot;all porn is like X&quot; but has to recant, chuckle, and recollect his words so that he can make sense to his audience... THAT is the problem. He&#x27;s talking about porn as he has experienced it — and that&#x27;s totally valid. But to say that porn has NO &quot;light touching&quot; or NO &quot;involvement of hands&quot;?<p>I&#x27;m sorry... I understand that we&#x27;re all trying to cultivate and grow the right kind of society here... But allowing such undisciplined modes of criticism to hand-wave and make bad arguments, entertaining ficticious assumptions and myopic perspectives? I will stop and be first to say, even if it is in defense of porn, — I will be the first philosopher to put his neck on the damn line so that at least I can envision a future that is palatable, knowing that I deep down am not evil or out to hurt anymore, in defense of porn I will say DEFINE YOUR TERMS.<p>And adding to this: <i>Hurt people hurt people</i>.<p>—<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/women-who-stray/201305/porn-is-not-the-problem-you-are"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/women-who-stray/201305/p...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.khou.com/news/crime/Young-Pearland-woman-murdered-in-Germany-129414893.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.khou.com/news/crime/Young-Pearland-woman-murdered...</a>",1394101735

This relates.<p>As a kid I grew up under the mistaken belief that I had HIV/AIDS. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a common thing for you folks, but for me — from the ages of 6 to 13 — I believed I had a highly stigmatized disease.<p>After &quot;exploring the bodies&quot; of two other young boys, their naked bodies and their penises, in a closet of my mother&#x27;s bedroom, I left that situation without any meaning or capacity to understand. The strict immediate feeling I recall from that situation, which haunts me to this day, is that something quite trivial happened. I thought their penises were interesting, and as friends that they were interesting. I was not particularly attracted to them, as I was 6. In a very strong way, I thought of them as just like me, and the entire event was more exploratory than sexual.<p>I wasn&#x27;t a very &quot;street smart&quot; kid, so to speak, but I could read at an 11th grade level in the 3rd grade. Letters and words simply made sense, and I could blaze through all sorts of sentences, sentences ranging from the domains of paleontology to technical manuals. I picked up a long list of dinosaur names and weird terms like &quot;Automatic Torque Control System&quot;. My mother an overworked engineer living in the South, a quite rigid Baptist woman deeply committed to a traditionalistic faith. &quot;Faggot&quot; was a word she used with its most poignant pejorative meaning.<p>Shortly after my escapede with my male friends, I found myself watching television here and there in the early 90s. Whenever I needed a rest from my LEGO-labrynth of a room, I&#x27;d think to myself &quot;I need something less mentally stimulating&quot;. You know the feeling, of wanting to watch a dumb action flick and all that. I&#x27;d literally spend 14-16 hours a day with LEGO, to myself, already quite solitary beyond my brief list of friends. Sometimes I&#x27;d go days without eating or sleeping, contriving some thing, dismantling the idea, going at it again, engineering my room into a universe that exactly met my specification. I couldn&#x27;t sleep sometimes, unless I arranged the pieces perfectly together, squeezed them tightly again and again, or at least imagined what pieces would need to exist in order for me to complete my idea.<p>But I digress — the point here is that media become a means of peace from myself. However, for my restricted social mind and my over fledgling intelligence (again, we&#x27;re talking 6 here), the media sensationalism of HIV/AIDS turn&#x27;d me into from a solitary, perhaps even arguably &quot;autistic&quot; child (I&#x27;d rock, throw fits if others touched my LEGOs, slam my head into trees, desks, walls, engaging in this peculiar wrist writhing activity — which I still do today, with this unsettling third-person onlooker feeling, and so on), from something a bit askew... into something much more troubling, much more foreign to what people, I honestly even believe, can, well, believe to exist.<p>After I had acquired the idea that my mother was vehemently opposed to whatever it was the television sensationalized, this particular disease — a disease —, I became detached and removed from human reality almost over night. I thought to myself literally daily that I made the gravest mistake possible, and that no one could ever know. I had associated my act of exploration with the contraction of this disease — I fell pray to a very terrible ill-logic.<p>I never drank after others. I strove my best not even to touch others. Hugging became a sin. My grandmother grew to despise me because I&#x27;d &quot;never kiss&quot; her. My was alienated by my avoidance, and my non-participatory attitude. I avoided other kids. I frequently gave non-responses to other people. Talking become a chore for me, particularly a chore not to confess in passing that I had done something wrong. I thought eye contact would give me away. I thought getting too close to any person would ruin my chances at least having a happy life alone, without ridicule or hatred. Each day as I absorbed myself in my own thoughts of some inevitable death either of the disease or hatred. LEGOs were honestly the only thing that kept me mentally stimulated or at least distracted from my own fate. God quickly became a Divine Comedian, with whom I&#x27;d engage in discourse, banter, madness, and with every emotion from hatred to guilt. When I came across the Book of Job later in life, it was chillingly accurate, and it made me exceptionally angry.<p>At one point the idea faded. I got smarter, and I learned that I had not contracted the disease.<p>But by this period, I realized something else was amiss. There was an error, of a very big sort. Around the age of 13, I realized that I was on a planet, rife with social life. The most immediate thought was that I had a lot of catching up to do.<p>In high school, I found myself gravitating toward the &quot;socially awkward&quot; group. The band kids, the self-professed rejects and minorities. The oddballs. The gamers. I distinctly recall at the age of 16 being in a room with some of these friends, where suddenly during our video gaming session, a porn magazine was revealed. I experienced no erection, and there was no interest. These pictures of women, naked and such — your typical work of gaudy pornographic material. I found it charming, almost endearing primarily that I was in a room with other males, and everyone was cool about the situation. I played Soul Calibur or Smash Brothers or whatever game we were into that week, against a friend, another flipped through pictures of naked men and women, another friend toggled the two activities. Then the day ended, as normal.<p>Here&#x27;s then, when I got an idea. There&#x27;s something &quot;normal&quot; about porn. I had come to the realization that in order to &quot;fix&quot; myself, I needed to &quot;be normal&quot; just as I was then. Guys looking at naked chicks, and not really thinking much of it. We said &quot;she&#x27;s hot&quot; here and there, or &quot;that&#x27;s corny&quot;. It reminded me very much of my experience at 6 or so.<p>I left that experience thinking, &quot;This porn stuff can help me in some way.&quot; And that&#x27;s when it happened. I found myself strongly interested in this material, but I was after something. Sure, yes, I found it arousing — but then that was secondary to some more basic initiative: &quot;this is normal. I am normal. I can do this.&quot;<p>I found myself spending hours a day looking at porn. I always tried to find just the &quot;right&quot; porn. The Internet became a well brimming with material.  The &quot;right&quot; porn consisted of these scenarios that started off &#x27;real&#x27; and then ended in this rather unexceptional way. There was a lot of POV as well — not necessarily interested in the people participating but their parts. My own penis is slightly disfigured from my circumcision — well, asymmetrical. It&#x27;s not a jarring or grotesque disfigurement. As a kid I thought it was upsetting, and brought concern. It&#x27;s essentially a seemingly incomplete job.<p>But the people and the themes never really interested me. I often found myself looking for the &quot;right&quot; penis, the &quot;right&quot; vagina, the right complexion (regardless of race), the &quot;right&quot; people. It went everywhere, from race A-on-race Z to race Z-on-raceA, and then back again. I found myself trying to figure out quickly what I am to do, and just how much was necessary for a &quot;normal&quot; experience. I always knew that anything beyond hardcore porn was beyond my needs, that fetish porn was beyond my needs. I wanted something that gave me what I thought everyone else had already figured out. Gradually it warped into something bigger — not in terms of the content I accepted, which always ranged from softcore to POV to roleplay (for years, it was a lot of role-play — I even spent years going into RP chatrooms with &quot;sex&quot; topics and working up my capacity to describe these sexual activities), but in terms of the commitment and preoccupation, the amount of time spent.<p>I want to be clear here. At no point did I think &quot;This is was people do normally&quot; — I was looking at the situation as someone who had a lot of catching up to do, and who <i>strove to be normal</i>. I wanted people to believe that I &quot;got along&quot; with sexual activity, that I understood what it was about — and that I wasn&#x27;t obsessed with something more fundamental: fitting in.",1394101692

It also guarantees to failover only in the majority side.<p>However when there is a partition and there are clients with a master that is in the minority, Sentinel does not make Redis automatically consistent, since Redis is asynchronously replicated.<p>In order to put a bound to the desynchronization possible (and the amount of writes you can lose in this scenario), you can configure Redis so that if it is not connected to N slaves receiving acks for M milliseconds, it stops accepting writes.<p>So what you do is to asynchronously sense the split and bound the write loss.<p>Example: you have three nodes, each run a Sentinel and a Redis instance. If your master gets partitioned with a few clients, and you configured the option I was referring to, after a few milliseconds or seconds, depending on your config, it will stop accepting writes. On the other side (in the majority side) a slave will get elected a master, and the clients will be able to write. When the partition heals all will be able to write to the new master.<p>About CP VS AP, I&#x27;ll reply to another comment asking the same.",1394101293

In many ways, you have more control over your fate as an entrepreneur than as an employee - I've seen mentions of entrepreneurial servitude, but working for a company on a H1-B seems like a much more precarious position.  In addition, with this proposed visa there are clear targets to hit - you know what you're getting into upfront.<p>Talking about rich people bringing their friends into the country... as far as I understand it, it sounds like EB-5 is still much better suited for that.  Pay $500,000 to start a business somewhere in rural America, and you're done - no strings attached, no work required (the business doesn't even have to be successful, unlike this proposal).",1267048455

The only way to <i>not</i> see them as an adult was to declare oneself a child. Whatever you may think of people who are categorically disinterested in these applications, this is not a good way to treat users. I know you're not saying it was fine the way it was, I just think it underscores the importance of a solution that fits in prevailing social mores. There are some things that people expect not to see unless they are specifically looking for them.

That Apple is demonstrably willing to go without them would seem to undermine such arguments. If they don't want to sell porn-like apps, why should they devote resources--any resources--to developing such a ghetto, classifying things which should and should not belong in that ghetto, verifying adult status through some unspecified system, ensuring the accuracy of that verification system, dealing with the complaints of ghetto-ized developers, complaints of developers afraid of being ghetto-ized, complaints of developers who wanted to get into the App Store via the ghetto but where rejected, complaints of adult users shafted by the verification system, complaints by users who don't think there should be a ghetto in the first place, complaints by users who thing the ghetto should include X, Y, and Z, and complaints from people who just like to complain. And this on top of an App Store review process that has borne criticism for inconsistency and delays from the start.<p>Again, <i>why</i> would they bother expending the resources to support something they don't appear to want to do in the first place? It may be that Apple is making a mistake that will hurt them in the long run, but it's not clear to me what they would get out of ghetto-izing that is in line with their aims.",1267047779

For each additional song a person downloads, there is a diminishing harm done to the artists and labels involved, and it eventually reaches a point where absolutely no additional harm is done.<p>Therefore, any punishment should be related to a reasonable estimate on the harm of the artists/labels (and of course multiplied to the point of punishment, but to a reasonable extent given the crime).<p>It would be different in a case of actual theft;  each physical CD stolen is a CD that cannot be sold to someone else, and it's an asset that the thief can resell.",1267047183

Note that an actual copy of the book itself is a collectors' item and sells for around $400; believe you me, if I could pick one of these up out of the bargain bin at Walgreens, I would.<p>Here's his description of the lovely Chlorine Triflouride:<p>”It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that's the least of the problem. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water-with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals-steel, copper, aluminium, etc.-because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminium keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.”",1267047142

Hoping to get some feedback on the concept side and on the business / implementation side.  (Also trying to figure out how to best explain this concept to less-technical viewers!)<p>We are launching a new e-commerce model where groups of customers can pool together to receive discounts.  A ""Buckit"" takes the simple idea of a group discount and augments it for the modern Web.  Anyone can create a Buckit, or join one that already exists. The more people who sign up for a Buckit, the less everyone pays for his or her own item. The final price each Buckit member pays for their itemis based on the number of people in the Buckit, and the amount keeps going down as more people join.  This model lets people take advantage of their social networks (online and offline) to spread the word about a cool product and save money at the same time.<p>NerdKits is launching this today and applying this to the educational kits we've sold online since 2007, but we're also interested in applying the concept to other e-commerce areas where there's a ""social or network utility"" to a product: event tickets, multiplayer video games, etc.<p>For more information, we have a 2-minute video demo:<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4vVhaUj8r0<p>Our live website:<p>http://www.nerdkits.com/buckits/<p>Plus this morning's press release with more details:<p>http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/02/prweb3632034.htm",1267046999

They not only have a notice -> take down system in place, which removed the video within hours, but they even helped in finding the people who were the problem in the first place.  They used their control to act responsibly. If they allowed it to <i>stay</i> on the site you could argue they're accountable for it, but its temporary existence is merely due to it being a user-submitted content host.<p>More-so than many other content-hosts, Google <i>did</i> act responsibly.  If anything, Youtube is a medium just like the paper, but Youtube responds more rapidly and identifies criminals using the system <i>uniquely</i>, which is something paper cannot do.<p>Shall we eliminate all paper?  It's easier to draw kiddie-porn on paper and post it up all over than it is to get away with it on Youtube.<p>Obviously, <i>harboring</i> criminals is different than <i>helping an investigation to find the criminals</i>.  But without a takedown notice being <i>ignored</i>, there's no harboring, because there's no effective warrant.  And without a <i>legal</i> takedown notice, there's no responsibility to remove anything, because to do otherwise would <i>encourage</i> people to restrict free speech just by complaining loudly.<p>Papermakers have the same measure of responsibility in this as Google.  They can restrict selling paper to anyone until they see and approve the use of it, or stop selling altogether, <i>or</i> they can have a safe-harbor because they're merely creating a <i>medium</i>.  If they sold paper to a book company that went on to write something which later got banned, they'd be in <i>exactly</i> the same position as Google, but nobody is saying we should all make paper ourselves, and affix our name and address to all the paper we make (running a server is easy to trace, telling who made paper isn't, so this is needed to level the playing field).  And, as nobody can guarantee that that name and address are genuine on the paper, it <i>cannot</i> prevent anonymity, and loses <i>significantly</i> to a web host like Google who can point you to the source of everything they find.<p>Please, everyone, <i>stop buying paper</i> because people can abuse it.

Our immigration programs have three paths: skilled labour, investment, and entrepreneurial. Skilled labour is simply letting people in who have skills we need, investment expects that you invest a $HIGH_AMOUNT into the Canadian economy (with the expectation, not requirement, of more), and entrepreneurial requires that you run your own business for $TIME before you qualify for citizenship.<p>The first category is usually a win for the country, since these people seek employment and are taxable, not to mention you didn't have to pay for their education.<p>The second and third categories are fundamentally broken - I personally know many families who do the absolute bare minimum to hit the permanent residency requirements, and keep all of their wealth off the books in Asia, bringing them in literal suitcases of cash (staying just under the declaration limit each time).

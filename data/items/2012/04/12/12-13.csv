3832026,comment,3830746,3831405,1,0,jeffwass,,,"Basically, entanglent of individual qubits is an important component of quantum computation. Namely, two coupled qubits have more 'information' and behave differently than two isolated qubits.<p>Eg, a single qubit can be represented as a 2 element vector (spinor) with complex number elements. That is four Degrees of Freedom (DOF). However, the vector must be normalized, which eliminates one DOF, and the entire vector is phase invariant (can be multiplied by an arbitrary phase exp^(i gamma) for any phase gamma, without effect). So that really leaves two true DOF for a single qubit.  These can be represented as angles on the Bloch sphere.  See my other post on this thread for a link to my java app to visualize a qubit, and also show the relationship to the spinor vector.<p>However, a system of 2 qubits\n can be represented as a 4 element complex vector. With the same constraints above for single qubits, this leaves 6 DOF for a two-qubit system. Each qubit individually has 2 DOF, but the entanglement itself represents another two DOF!<p>Many of the quantum computational processes you may have heard about (quantum teleportation, quantum communication, Shor's algorithm) invariably make use of his extra information in multi-qubit systems.<p>Eg, two spin-1/2 systems can couple together in the spin-0 singlet state, or as a spin-1 triplet state, or as a linear combination of both.  This means that two fermions (subject to Pauli exclusion principle) can act like bosons when entangled, and do weird things in aggregate like Bose Einstein condensation. Very funky.",1334233328

There has to be a meeting of minds and everyone has to know what the deal is up-front. You can't just sneak in an unreasonable term by including some tricky language written by a $500/hour commercial lawyer at the bottom of page 17, and then expect that the term will stand up in court if the person reading the contract was a legally untrained consumer and it would have taken them several days and hundreds of dollars of legal advice just to understand the agreement for your $10/month service.<p>In this case, if 500px are presenting a tl;dr of their legal terms in this way, they might be implicitly acknowledging that their detailed terms are too difficult for their customers to understand. If I were them, I would be more worried that a court would hold that, notwithstanding the weasel words at the top, <i>only</i> the summary was binding, because 500px clearly intended that customers might read only that summary and then choose whether or not to enter into the agreement on that basis.<p>Of course, in law it's rarely that simple, and lawyers do (try to) exclude certain wording such as headings all the time. Hopefully 500px did get proper advice from someone qualified in their own jurisdiction and satisfy themselves that what I've described here isn't really the case. I do appreciate the spirit of what they're trying to do, and I completely agree that absurdly long, detailed and technical on-line agreements make a mockery of anyone's legal system.",1334232725

Not fun, but definitely was an exquisite education in the school of hard knocks.<p>Lawyers throw all kinds of language into a contract, that doesn't mean the intent was there.  Vague, unfair, or overly broad language that was not clearly understood by both parties tends to get reduced, removed, or modified in accordance with what both parties reasonably understood to be the intent.  So if they tried to get overly sneaky and do something where the basically version says X, but the full clause says we do X,Y,Z, then the courts may very well rule the implied intent was X but Y and Z were not implied and agreed to.<p>If they understand what they are doing, and plan to strictly abide by the basically section, this is a fantastic idea.  If they at some point decide they want to get sneaky and put something in the detailed version that is not covered in the ""basically"" section, they may well find themselves in a world of trouble if it comes to court.<p>My experience was a company trying to sue me, despite them breaching the contract.

As someone who takes ownership of their work, I'm tired of jumping around from gig to gig as an outsider and really want to take pride in being a dependable, go-getting team player for 'Company X'.<p>So, after casting a wide net, I started hearing from recruiters--mostly banks/financial institutions and large tech companies--almost immediately. Interestingly, the application process for the banks were the most organized and I received my first offer within a month. The tech companies on the other-hand couldn't quite figure me out... For starters, at one tech co. an interviewer insisted on knowing my salary requirements, and because it was a company I really wanted to work for, I responded by saying ""flexible"". She asked me again, and I told her about a job offer from a bank and she looked up to say, ""who wants to work at a bank?"". The interview ended abruptly and the next day I found out the company wasn't going to proceed.<p>While all this was going on, I was truckin' along through Google's application process. Considering how competitive Google's hiring requirements are, I was not feeling optimistic until they invited me to the final, on-site interviews. I left their offices (which are awesome btw) feeling really good. I honestly thought that it could not have gone any better. Unfortunately, the next day I was told they were proceeding with different applicants. My heart dropped into my stomach; I had come so far, tempted by the possibility of being a part of the dreamy Google culture, only to be shot down in the end.<p>Despite not having a college degree, I'm a fairly straight-arrow professional. I take work very seriously, and so I dressed-up (coat and tie) to all my interviews to reflect that. Considering the stark contrast in culture between banks and Silicon Valley tech companies, is this character trait playing against me at places like Google? I can't help but over-analyze the situation as all my cards seem to be falling on one side of the table.<p>I'll take any advice I can get from the HN community. Thanks everyone.",1320940333

A naive way to express this would be that, if the user is not logged in, your getUser() method returns null.<p>But then you have to keep testing for null, over and over again, before you can do anything with the user. And the user-is-null case is suspiciously similar to user-is-not-authorized-to-do-this-thing.<p>Solution: make a hierarchy where there's an abstract User class, concretized by NonLoggedInUser and LoggedInUser. The NonLoggedInUser returns false for all isAuthorizedTo().<p>Now you always have a User, it's just that sometimes that User does ""nothing"". So you just ask if user.isAuthorizedTo('doTheThing').<p>Fowler generalizes this into the SpecialCase pattern. <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/specialCase.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/specialCase.html</a>",1320939794

3220429,comment,3220242,3220242,6,0,vladd,,,"National Geographic made an editorial describing how teen brains are more prone to risky behavior:<p>>> Peaking during adolescence is risk-taking. We court risk more avidly as teens than at any other time. This shows reliably in the lab, where teens take more chances in controlled experiments involving everything from card games to simulated driving. And it shows in real life, where the period from roughly 15 to 25 brings peaks in all sorts of risky ventures and ugly outcomes.<p>If teens think as well as adults do and recognize risk just as well, why do they take more chances? Here, as elsewhere, the problem lies less in what teens lack compared with adults than in what they have more of. Teens take more risks not because they don't understand the dangers but because they weigh risk versus reward differently: In situations where risk can get them something they want, they value the reward more heavily than adults do.<p>The period's uniqueness rises from genes and developmental processes that have been selected for over thousands of generations because they play an amplified role during this key transitional period: producing a creature optimally primed to leave a safe home and move into unfamiliar territory. The move outward from home is the most difficult thing that humans do, as well as the most criticalnot just for individuals but for a species that has shown an unmatched ability to master challenging new environments. In scientific terms, teenagers can be a pain in the ass. But they are quite possibly the most fully, crucially adaptive human beings around. Without them, humanity might not have so readily spread across the globe. <<<p>Full version at <a href=""http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/10/teenage-brains/dobbs-text"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/10/teenage-brains/dob...</a>",1320939671

I think the answer is: It depends on what you mean by <i>focus</i>.<p>Humans are certainly capable of long periods of concentration, of all sorts. Sitting in a tree waiting for the prey to come into range. Sitting under the tree patiently digging out edible roots. Sitting in a band jamming for twelve hours straight. Sitting facing the wall in Zen meditation.<p>But, in programming, the word <i>focus</i> has a specific and somewhat paradoxical meaning. When we are focused on programming it feels as if we are focused on <i>something</i>. And yet when you think about what you're actually <i>doing</i> in programming the word <i>focus</i> seems less and less appropriate.<p>Here's programming: You think about the feature you want to build, and then you think about the existing system that you want to attach it to, and then you think about the big picture, and then you think about an individual data structure. And then you sketch the module on a whiteboard, and then you write an empty module file, and then you use a C debugger to find and fix a bug in the module loader, and then you patiently write an editor macro to change a giant text file from XML to JSON, and then you write a unit test for the JSON parser. Then you write the parser. Then you stare at the parser and try to imagine explaining it to a junior PHP developer. And then you sigh and mentally kick yourself for overdesigning and quickly reimplement the parser, except without the tricky metaclass and the tail recursion and the nifty hack that reads like obfuscated Perl, and then you sigh again and get some coffee. And then you find the module loader is still broken after all and you do ten minutes of research into alternative module loaders, during which you realize that maybe you should have used an entirely different <i>framework</i> for this system and make a note to research the alternative framework for your <i>next</i> system.<p>And this is what programmers call ""focus"": Bouncing up and down among five or six layers of abstraction, hopefully doing no individual task for longer than five minutes at a time. (After all, this is programming: If you've got an hour of rote typing to do, why isn't there a macro that can do it for you?) But you're focused on <i>something</i>, because the hours are flying by and if someone interrupts you, you tend to want to throw things at them.<p>And perhaps this is why we programmers have such <i>trouble</i> with focus: The state we call ""incredibly productive focus"" is actually oddly difficult to distinguish from ADD. But it's <i>focused</i> ADD, and that's the secret.",1320939263

I used to have whole days when I don't leave my chair, let alone the house. Now I make an effort to at least walk around the block before work.<p>The points about planning are very well made; it's vital to keep yourself aware of what you're doing.<p>But you do need to work hard at not losing it. I've lost days to multiplayer 8 ball pool on miniclip (I'm like a sniper on that thing). Right now I've been wearing these clothes all week (but I did have a shower yesterday!). It's difficult when there are other people around - my wife used to get in from work at 5 and start chatting to me and I had to continually remind her that I don't finish till 5.30. I miss fresh air, and I miss talking to people, even though I'm something of a recluse.<p>It can be hugely fun though! You get a massive amount of control over your workflow, and you get as big a desk as you can fit in your room. Right now I have a shelf unit filled with toy robots in front of me! I voice-skype with my boss almost every day, and we chat on skype all the time. I don't have to worry about taking a few minutes off to pop to the post office or whatever. I save time by not having any traveling time, and I get to make the joke that I walk to work every day!<p>So in terms of the effects on you personally, yes it can be depressing, but it can also be fun, especially if you manage yourself.<p>In terms of how it affects your work, we have found that we miss the little 'pondering' conversations by the proverbial water cooler. If I have a problem I'm working on and it gets too much and I want to take a break, I sit at my desk, at home, either tweeting or just thinking to myself. If was at work I might wander over to my boss's desk and start chatting about that product idea we had last week, so it's worth trying to build in some mechanisms to replace those kind of chats between you and your co-workers.",1320939106

Some people in the office are most productive in the last couple of hours of the core work day (i.e. 3 to 5) and that is tough for me because I'm trying to have dinner with my family and get kids ready for bed.<p>The wife and kids all understand that when I am in my office I am ""at work"" and interruptions are considered just as if they were asking me to take time from the office and come back home.<p>The biggest challenge for me when I was shifting into this method of work is the fact that work is always just a few steps away.  When you are passionate about your work and job, your brain doesn't stop working just because you aren't at your desk anymore.  When a great idea comes to you or you remember something that you really need to schedule or write down, it is very easy to say, ""I'll be right back"" and suddenly lose an hour or two of your free time.  I won't say I have conquered this challenge yet (my wife would scoff so loud I think HN might actually pick it up and post it as a reply), but being aware of it is the critical part.

I know this is probably an edge case...<p>I just signed up - it was quick and easy (the site felt exceptionally quick actually, maybe just got lucky). Signup was pretty smooth, although if you made it shorter I wouldn't complain. Can't I fill in my full name later? Or my company name after signup, not before?<p>Warning bells did go off when I was on the 'Plans and pricing' page, and I almost didn't sign up until I noticed the little text ""no credit card details needed"". It seemed like I'd be asked for my credit card details, and I hadn't noticed the 'start free trial' button, even though it's big.<p>The UI was good. Really good. I was trying to be critical, but the instant simple things were really intuitive. I didn't really push it by trying to do anything complicated, but those first few steps were easy. I'm familiar with the mockups interface from the desktop version, so not much to say there.<p>The only thing where I got lost was - in the actual mockup, and you want to get back to your project page. There's a big 'save' button, but not a big 'Save and close' button, or just ""back to projects manager"" button. I had to look around.<p>If I'm being really picky now, the intro video was a bit boring - I'd give the highlights first, and the step-by-step guide after the first 15 seconds of wow me awesomeness.<p>Would I pay? Yes, if I was still doing this kind of work regularly. For now, the Desktop licence is serving me fine.<p>Long response, hope it helps.

3220317,comment,3219909,3219909,53,0,2mur,,,"I'm a pathologist and an avocational programmer. This is pretty neat material and is very relevant to me, as I have been trying to bone up my math chops with Khan Academy videos so that I can tackle some computer vision related work in pathology.<p>With regards to the study, I will just point out that the system is not diagnosing breast carcinoma, but rather is producing a score which reflects the prognosis as relates to overall survival of the patient (so it is not as impressive as the somewhat hyperbolic HN title makes it out to be... a better title would be 'Stanford computer analyzes breast cancer more accurately than human doctor' which is not surprising at all given the well-documented interobserver variability in breast cancer scoring, particularly in moderately-differentiated tumors). That is to say that the computer already knows the tissue that it is looking at is a tumor and not benign breast tissue. Furthermore, it is really only providing a histologic (or morphologic) score, which is to say, that it is attempting to predict how aggressive the tumor will behave based upon how well or not well it is differentiated (how ugly it is). These days, this score is actually less useful in clinical practice than other information such as whether or not the tumor cells are expressing estrogen/progesterone hormone receptors, or if it is over-expressing Her2-neu protein, as these are possible paths for cancer therapy (anti-estrogen drugs vs. Herceptin) in addition to being prognostic indicators (tumors which express ER/PR generally behave better than tumors which are ER/PR negative and express Her2), as well as the stage (or how far the cancer has already spread) at the time the patient is diagnosed. There are a bunch of companies which are getting FDA approval for computer vision related algorithms for scoring immunohistochemical assays for ER/PR/Her2 [1].<p>So I am actually far less concerned about a computer doing my job very well, which is actually looking at a piece of tissue on a slide and making a tumor versus not-tumor distinction. This is very hard to do and I think will continue to be even harder for computers/computer-vision/AI to do for a long time to come. I am far more concerned about molecular diagnostics. That is the true-future for making cancer determinations and may even eliminate the part of my job where I tell you if something is benign vs. malignant.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aperio.com/pathology-services/analyze-slides-automated-pathology.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aperio.com/pathology-services/analyze-slides-auto...</a>",1320938216

Word it as a cease and desist, with a demand that the other app be removed or renamed, and send it to the App Store team, as well as Apple legal, and the developers themselves.<p>Apple passes this stuff on verbatim to the other developer. (I have been on the receiving end myself.) If it's a mealy-mouthed pretty-please, I'm sure they'll ignore it, if they're dickish enough to name-squat on your app.<p>It helps tremendously if you've got a trademark for the app name (even a pending trademark) you're golden. Or, if there's any other infringement (i.e. they stole your icon, which is copyright infringement) you're in good shape, too.<p>Edited to add: not a lawyer, my legal advice is worthless, etc.",1320937341

If there's an 'emergency' at work, say a server has blown up or something, then sure, I lock myself away for a bit until it's fixed.<p>Work will still be there when they're in bed.<p>I'm not suggesting that either way is right, but just that those are my priorities and they work for me.<p>Also it may have some to do with my own ways of working - I intersperse work with playing games, browsing the net, doing DIY, playing games with kids, walking the dog etc. I don't have any ""work"" or ""non work"" times really (Or an office - I usually work on the sofa in the living room).

You don't have to bow to the gods to get a working, documented interface (see the Stevey post just before when he tries to implement focus-follows-mouse in an OS X accessibility API which is basically undocumented  and, fatally, doesn't work as advertised in its comments).<p>Here's another way to think about it: cobbling together myriad programs at the terminal and getting them to talk is an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of GNU Emacs.

This system aspires to spare the innocent, but there is never a guarantee.""<p>I didn't say there is such a guarantee...just that our system is supposed to protect the innocent from conviction even if it means the guilty occasionally go free (at least many of our founding fathers felt that this was the purpose of our jury system).  If you don't believe that is the correct way for our legal system to operate, we'll have to agree to disagree.  I think it is more important for the courts to first do no evil than to always get vengeance for crimes committed (even if it's sometimes taken against an innocent party).<p>Anyway, I'm not saying I believe Hans is innocent, and I've also stated above that the circumstantial evidence is pretty overwhelming.  But, I am saying that one should be cautious with purely circumstantial evidence, and that I would find it hard to convict someone if I were on a jury in a trial with only circumstantial evidence.<p>""Literally thousands of innocent-but-convicted Americans would be free today if they had even half of the legal resources that Reiser hired and then apparently chose to ignore.""<p>That's a completely different discussion, and I agree with your statement entirely, though I'm getting the impression that you consider it far less of a problem than I do.",1209433387

176191,comment,176098,176171,0,0,palish,,,"But it is pretty horrible that Hans was convicted of murder with only circumstantial evidence.  For petty crimes, or even for more intense crimes like battery, it might be worth it to make decisions based entirely on risky (though possibly accurate) circumstantial evidence.  But when the most valuable portion of a person's life is on the line, the legal system's stance has to be that this person can only be convicted if there is hard evidence he committed the horrible crime, no matter how much we may want to believe that circumstantial evidence.<p>Imagine what the result is if we're wrong about Hans.  He is an extraordinarily smart person, a valuable member of society, and could have made significant accomplishments in the next 25 years with his intelligence and experience.  If we're wrong then we're throwing away his future contributions to society, depriving people that he would have helped of his assistance, stealing him from his friends, and in general not allowing him to have a positive effect on anyone's life for the next 25 years.  Admittedly, in the grand scheme of things, that isn't <i>too</i> horrible, but it would certainly be horrible for the people that he would have had a good effect on.  Perhaps he would have inspired some child to go on and do great things.  We can't know.<p>Based on that, if a person is to be imprisoned for a huge portion of his life then there should be no doubt about his guilt.<p>It's true that it's impossibly unlikely that Nina made herself vanish, but consider that someone else could have used her to frame him.",1209433227

I'd like to see some citations on that, as I don't find them at all similar (beyond both being object systems in a dynamic language).  The JavaScript module pattern (which obviously came later) feels more like Perl 5 objects to me.  Likewise for some Lisp and Scheme object systems that make use of innate closure support to build the object system from primitives rather than building it in--Perl objects are effectively hashes with almost no new core language features (bless, and the new special variable @ISA, primarily).",1209432443

(Consider for example that Telkom, SA's goverment telco, is itself listed on the NYSE for this same reason).<p>To some companies, LSE is attractive because London is the ""closest stop"" from Johannesburg, travel-wise (and an easy timezone diff).  In SABMiller's case, they are cross-listed in London and Johannesburg.<p>This makes sense when you talk to stockbrokers in the USA (or Canada) that tell you they will execute a trade on the JSE @ $250 minimum commission -- but that they must advise against it because the markets are so volatile (which to me seems an exageration).",1209432254

I like them both, but Perl is also more comfortable for me.  Ruby maybe even moreso, but I've never done any large projects in Ruby, so I can't say for sure.  But I do know that when I write a few lines of Perl, even after ten years, I tend to include a few syntax errors...when I was learning Ruby I was often stunned by how many lines of code I could write between syntax errors.  It's probably an order of magnitude higher, and something I've never experienced before.  Python, I found to have roughly parity with Perl, which many Pythonistas find shocking.

But the rule is beyond <i>reasonable</i> doubt, not beyond <i>all conceivable doubt</i>.<p>The reason to disbelieve the ""elaborate framing"" hypothesis is straightforward: It's really easy to prove, and yet it has not been proved. All you have to do to prove it is find Nina. And yet she has not been found.<p>In fiction you can make a character disappear by saying ""they moved to Russia/Argentina/Outer Mongolia and disappeared"". In the real world it really is harder than that. Russia is not on the moon. You can phone up some Russians right now if you want and have a chat. Even if the Russian government won't cooperate with an investigation, there must be private investigators in Russia. All Hans and his legal team have to do is hire a P.I. to stake out the kids and produce some evidence that they're being visited by a mystery woman who might be Nina and suddenly his case becomes a lot stronger. He could still do this now, from prison, if he wanted. Might really shorten that 25 year sentence.<p>I suppose you could argue that Nina is so sneaky and so well connected that she and her kids have truly vanished from mortal ken, like Osama bin Laden. I haven't followed the case, so I don't know if Reiser tried to argue that. If he did, it obviously didn't work.<p>And I suppose you could argue that the woman hates Hans so much that she's willing to be separated from her kids for 30 years (or forever, via suicide -- there's a Sherlock Holmes plot for you) just to maximize his suffering.

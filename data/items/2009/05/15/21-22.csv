Perhaps posting such followup links in comments to the original story could be given higher (or folded-under) placement -- keeping the topics together, giving the original story a greater lifetime, reducing clutter, unifying discussion. (That is, posters or editors could fold stories into existing threads.)<p>Also: can we get <i>comments</i> ranked in <i>classic</i> fashion? Or maybe display two numbers for a comment's score: all/classic? I think I'm seeing more cases where the absolute sign of the score would be different for early-vs.-recent voters.",1242424669

611440,comment,611405,611405,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"This can be a really difficult issue to discuss. I have a theory as to why this is happening, but I think it would inevitably be misinterpreted as being sexist (against females).<p>I'd also guess I'm not the only one thinking along these lines.<p>Edit: Well, OK, here goes...I am not at all 100% sure of all this, but it appears females, on average, have more respect for societal measures of prestige than males do. Now that females are more empowered to do what they want (which is great) they're chasing after the generally accepted indicators of prestige of the past and present. School awards, doctors, lawyers, college degrees in general, and in fact credentials of virtually any type are all seeing a dramatically increased female presence; in same cases females are starting to outnumber males entirely. Since credentialism was a mistake to begin with, as it slowly erodes (both <i>because of</i> males starting to choose not to go down the path of credential-seeking and thanks to the later results of that - i.e., as more and more people without credentials do well, credentials become less important) people are going to notice that females are ""overrepresented"" in many areas where credentials are emphasized. Credentialists[1] (who are usually the ones quoted in the media) will see this as a problem, when it's really a sign of the decline of credentialism.<p>This is a trend that will probably take decades to play out. But you can already see the signs. There was an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education recently about how going to grad school to study the humanities is a disastrous choice today, and it is now overwhelmingly women who are making that choice. That's just one of the more obvious examples.<p>Who knows, maybe this is a one-time phenomenon that has resulted from female empowerment, and it won't happen again?<p>I don't think I did a very good job of explaining myself here, but I'm a little rushed so I'll try to elaborate on it in the future.<p>[1] People who tend to believe in or support credentials.",1242424368

The modern equivalent is the articles written about Safari that suggest Apple did the same.<p>2. Nor was was Linux for home brews - Red Hat, the commercial distro, had emerged as the current leader for both businesses and nerds, with Apache (written by the ASF, which still had strong commercial roots) and to a lesser extent Samba (which I guess back then was still relatively uncommercial, so I give the article that).<p>3.

Google has published a few blog posts a while back about how it does it (I'm sure it's even more improved now).<p>The breakthrough of W|A is number (3) in my list above. They kick ass and frankly make search much more useful than anything we have now. You're no longer searching for pages that have the info, but getting answers directly. A Cambridge, UK, startup called True Knowledge does this too, and it's impressive (W|A is much better in data presenation though).<p>So for an alpha product, please do not judge it by have stale or incomplete data.

You can't have an absence of power heirarchy when some people are filthy rich and others are starving to death.  It's called ""libertarianism"" (and why libertarians try to co-opt the anarcho prefix is beyond me, it's not as if it wins you popularity points).<p>Usually this stems from an arbitrary distinction between oppression of ""the government"" and oppression by a private party.  When you make the (absurd) assumption that oppression can only come from the government, sure, it makes sense.  However... well, it's an absurd assumption.  At the end of the day, oppression is oppression (and the distinction between government and private enterprise gets awfully fuzzy in the kinds of worlds these so-called ""anarcho-capitalists"" envision anyway.

But race cars still have manual or semi-automatic transmissions. Thus race drivers are empowered to do neat tricks while driving ... like not changing gears while passing another car to not lose acceleration. A manual transmission is also great for off road driving. And great drivers are also good mechanics ... cars break during races, and without knowing your car, you probably won't finish.<p>Of course, not all of us are meant to be race drivers. But if you want to be the best you can be, taking the ease route is not the way to go.",1242422267

For instance, if I loan money to someone who then goes bankrupt, I am entitled to some of their property.  Even if it was a really stupid loan.<p>In this particular case, women aren't particularly good at determining whether a potential husband will turn out to be a scumbag, so it makes some sense for society to protect them against that possibility.  (Actually, men aren't very good at determining whether a potential wife will be a scumbag either, so society should probably protect them, too...)",1242422093

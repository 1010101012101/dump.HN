In practice, it looks like they hinder it, and instead enable a legalized form of extortion and parasitism.<p>I'm glad that software is unpatentable here in Costa Rica (as far as I know). I hope we never get infected by this detestable legal concept. As someone who develops software for international markets, though, I'm afraid I'm not immune to this issue, even if software patents are locally unenforceable in my case. I hope developers in other countries (the U.S. in particular) will care enough about this issue to organize and seek reform. Please, do what it takes to convince or hire legislators to remove or drastically reform this misguided legal concept!",1305597478

Given that my wife and I do try to split duties as it makes sense (""Ain't mama happy, ain't <i>nobody</i> happy""), I have to say that right now, <i>I</i> couldn't do the traditional startup 14-hours-a-day thing either.<p>And ye gods, would I ever not care to combine the traditional startup stress and a colicky baby.<p>Baby care and startups really don't go together very well, and it's not really a gender thing at all. In fact, the reason I'm on HN right this second, rather than working on my pet Haskell HTML normalization library (or, in other words, ""quality time I could be working on a startup""), is that I am literally typing this paragraph one-handed as I have a bottle in the other. Even when he's snoozing while I've got him, I am virtually incapable of Zone when my brain knows that at any minute, a piercing scream that I must drop everything to service may emerge. There may be some set of people who can work through that without short-changing the kids, no sarcasm intended (not all kids take the same level of care, either, this one has been much needier than his older brother), but I can't say it's unfair to consider a baby to be a negative indicator for a near-term startup effort, regardless of the gender of who is having the baby.<p>(I mean, do you even want to get startup-married to someone who would short-change a baby for your startup? There's commitment, then there's just plain bad priority decision making. Babies, pets, and startups: If you're not willing to commit to what it takes, it's better just to not.)",1305597398

It's been a long time since my Constitutional Law class, but IIRC there are many precedents, several involving Jehova's witnesses (they were a persecuted minority at the time), passing out leaflets and flyers and having similar laws passed and overturned.<p>Here's a similar situation in Texas in 2005: <a href=""http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/federal-judge-texas-man-may-leaflet-in-illinois-state-building"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/federal-judge-texas-man-...</a><p>U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo ruled earlier this month that the law violates the Constitution because it gives state officials too much discretion in determining when to issue permits and prohibits religious exhibits. Castillo also faulted the law for banning people who want to distribute leaflets from approaching the public without providing an exception in cases where people consent to being approached.<p>The judge reaffirmed the First Amendment principles and showed that the First Amendment rights are valued in Chicago, said Elizabeth Murray, whose client Kevin Cantrell filed the lawsuit in April 2004 against officials at the Thompson Center and the state Department of Central Management Services. The center is the state's main government building in Chicago.<p>This also protects more than just religious leafletters.

I can recognize problem types from my computer science classes but I would need to spend time googling for the exact problem and possible solutions before I could give an answer.<p>The reason I haven't bothered to apply? I don't know how good I really am. I keep jumping between over estimating and under estimating my ability. But, I'm pretty sure I'm not a rockstar since I suck at math. A weak math background keeps a bunch of computer science out of my reach. Still, I've taken a course on OpenGL and managed to pass with a high A because I worked extremely hard to understand all of the vector math that was required.<p>It certainly doesn't help that I've failed every logic puzzle that's ever been presented to me. Ask me to reverse the order of words in a string and you'll get:<p><pre><code>    ""Words in a string"".split("" "").reverse.join("" "") #=> ""string a in Words""

On the contrary, when I'm programming in Clojure, most of my data structures are made out of hashes and vectors.<p>And most definitely, the need to walk a linked list inhibits parallel thinking (and, just as importantly parallel execution) and so we shouldn't avoid baking richer data structures into lisps. Again, Clojure does this and even Scheme does too, with R6RS with hashes as well as the more established vectors, because, again, Scheme is not about axiomatic minimalism. But to make a hash <i>the</i> fundamental data structure out of which everything else is constructed would be crazy.<p>There's plenty of room on the world for atoms, pairs, vectors, hashes, and maybe even primitive sets.

Just the core material can take at least a year or two to finish as a full time student. This should include data structures, algorithms, some discrete mathematics, computability/logic, programming languages (class on issues and features in language design and implementation), and some computer systems work (looking into lower level system topics). It is a lot to cover and absorb in a summers time. Unless you are familiar and have experience with most of these topics, just one summer is extremely optimistic.<p>CS isn't just about programming and software engineering, as there's quite a bit of theory involved and generally isn't learned just writing code on your own, which I'm assuming is where you've picked up what you know. It can be much easier to get a software engineering or a programming related degree if that is the case, and should be more doable in a short time frame.<p>P.S. I'm assuming you are like most programmers that have learned programming on your own, and you haven't dug into the more theoretical topics on your own. Most don't, and I wouldn't have learned most of the more theoretical topics on my own. But they are very useful and good to know, as they will make you a better programmer.

Clearly there are benefits and drawbacks either way.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/+bug/708920"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/+bug/708...</a>",1305594428

That's because men and women have babies together.<p>Women carry babies for a 9-month term, during which time they are - in most cases - 100% able to work and 'contribute'. Labor takes ~36 hours; it can take just a few hours for scheduled c-sections. After labor, the baby comes home to Mom AND Dad.<p>For the average couple, there's a window of about 2 days in which the woman is out of commission. (Yes, that's simplifying things.)<p>A woman is only out of commission if her partner is not able or willing to help her with the responsibilities of being a parent. That's the only scenario in which she'd have to choose to be a mom before being a 'career woman'. So simply help your wives/girlfriends with the baby duties, and no choice will be required. :)",1305594420

It's just littering at this point.<p>I know somebody pays for them, but people pay for their fast food wrappers, too, and they aren't allowed to leave them on other people's porches.  I paid for the beer in my fridge, but I'm not going to leave a bag of empties hanging from my neighbor's doorknob.<p>I really don't know how the legal exception works, how the law distinguishes one act of spewing worthless crap into the environment from another, but it should be possible to cut down on the constant flyers under wiper blades, takeout menus on doorknobs, etc., and still let people put up posters about lost pets, local missing persons, and neighborhood garage sales.",1305594357

2554863,comment,2554081,2554081,2,0,asharp,,,"Adults especially seem to forget that there is no clear change that happens when kids turn 18. Children turn into adults in a very gradual manner over a large period of time rather heterogeneously. This then causes problems when adults, especially those who have been adults for a large period of time attempt to treat all ""children"" (including teenagers/etc.) as children, especially when the use of power is used.<p>To give an example (taken from this page), put yourself into this sort of position. You have somebody who cares for you, wants all that is best for you. Somebody like a spouse. You live together, talk/etc. If you found out that they were spying on you, listening in on what you talk with to your friends, trying to find what websites you visit/etc. You'd consider it a rather massive invasion of privacy and you'd consider the spouse to be at the very least creepy, even if they were aiming to learn this information ""for your own good"".<p>Similarly a few posts here are variants on ""spy on your kids"", using various clandestine methods. I'd imagine that you would find it rather distasteful if your government were caught doing similar things to you, especially if the reasons used were that it was ""for your own good"", and yet the child's perspective in this isn't being considered.<p>To illustrate, say you are 18 and one day (age of majority 18), and had any of those things happen to you, you would be, quite understandably, pissed. Now as a 17 year old, your reaction would likely be unchanged, however there would be a lot less understanding and a lot more of a tendency to explain the anger generated and the resulting behavior as simply ""poor behavior"" of the child.",1305594024

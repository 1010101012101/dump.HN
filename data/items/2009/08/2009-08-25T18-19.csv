With reference to the subset of high income earners, I'm not saying that they would be more or less creative than others in those positions who had better opportunities.  I am however saying that the nature of their jobs - as high income earners - suggests that they need to provide something relatively unique as a function of their job that reflects value <i>on average</i> at least equal to their income (unless you're saying that most have somehow lucked into ""high income"" and on average the people who pay them are irrational/stupid).  Again this isn't to say that someone else in that position couldn't be more or less creative - it is however to say that the nature of their job based on the attribute of high income requires more creativity.<p>I never said that being creative was the only path to wealth - however, innovation does require creativity and innovation is how wealth is created where rule of law exists.  Wealth is a reflection that society appreciates a given idea/innovation.  I'd even argue that seeing arbitrage also requires a certain level of creativity though as noted, I would concede that inheritance does not.  Nor would I restrict it to the self made rich people as the reality is even those born into wealth would need to exercise a certain level of creativity to maintain/grow it 
(even if others might be more effective at doing so).",1251226775

      This leads to some incompatibility with bash for scripting purposes
      the contextual completion stuff is infuriating when it's overly restrictive
  
  * A pure bourne shell (like dash) by nature doesn't support bashisms
      like $() as an alternative to ``

785469,comment,780667,785047,0,0,kragen,,,"That's awesome. Yeah, I've been thinking along pretty similar lines.<p>4chan is basically a ""paging channel"" or ""advertisement channel"": anybody can post, which means it can't provide reliable delivery (any message can be swamped by spam) or archival, but that's the only way to establish communication between people who don't have a pre-existing relationship (either directly or through their social network).<p>Poisoning/controversy is inherent in human-readable, non-centrally allocated, shared namespaces. (See Zooko's triangle.) It's not always a problem — Google shows that your suggested approach of using a trust network to choose among the candidate versions can work pretty well — but in the cases where it <i>is</i> a problem, you can reduce the magnitude of the problem by using self-certifying names (like SHA1 sums), unshared namespaces (like petnames), or centrally-allocated names (like DNS).  Nick Szabo's ""Secure Property Titles"" proposal is the only plausible alternative I've seen. (I don't know enough about social dynamics to predict whether it would work as he predicts.)<p>One of the advantages of hash-addressed data (data named with a self-certifying name that consists of a secure hash of its contents) is that it can be replicated to many peers without any particular concern for integrity or timeliness. (And in Freenet and BitTorrent, it is.) So it might be good to use hash-addressed data for as much of the system as possible. Localhost only stores <i>filenames</i> in directory nodes, then uses Kademlia to look up the .torrent infohashes associated with various versions of the filename; it would be good to often provide durable links consisting of the infohash itself.<p>The other thing I think is needed is a way to publish a mutable resource that only you can update. Such a resource can have a self-certifying (but non-human-readable) name consisting of the hash of your public key, possibly an ID number, and a timestamp.<p>Localhost, for those who are wondering what we're talking about: <a href=""http://p2p.cs.mu.oz.au/software/Localhost/thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://p2p.cs.mu.oz.au/software/Localhost/thesis.pdf</a>",1251226436

Whence the poet starving in his garret?<p>There's a similarly odd attitude to learning in some sectors of academia; from one perspective, education is a worldly enabler -- and from another, it is an end in and of itself and any hint of application to base commerce is positively contemptible. (MBAs versus classical philosophers, so to speak.)<p>The idea that art is disconnected from commerce doesn't apply across the board. Coco Chanel or Karl Largerfeld create(d) costumes that are certainly revered as works of art -- but they weren't expected to hold base commerce in disdain: in fact, their art was their business and their business was very lucrative indeed. Their sector (haut couture) was somehow exempt from the usual rules ...<p>I hypothesize that we're dealing with a cultural relic of the age of aristocracy. To the nobility who expected to inherit wealth, having to work for a living was a symptom of poverty: therefore it must be denied at all costs, which meant that anything they engaged in must remain impeccably untainted by money-grubbing. Anyone in such a culture with ambitions to better themselves had better play by the rules ... and so the more elevated the culture, the greater the distance between cultural activity and commerce. An exception could be made for couture -- aristocrats have employed tailors for millennia, and the more expensive and extravagant the tailoring the better -- but couture wasn't traditionally a career that aristocrats might enter. Academia or literature, on the other hand ...<p>And the aristocrats? Their descendants are still with us to this day, in the form of the hyper-rich -- and major patrons of the arts fall in this category.",1251223957

But as he often tries to remind people, he is, in fact, a comedian.  Brilliant, cutting, insightful, with an unparalleled nose for sniffing out bullshit, yes, but still a comedian.<p>You may find this hard to believe, but Bill O'Reilly's original schtick was dispensing with the ""inane idea of journalistic neutrality"", too.  When people would say things he found outrageous, he would call them on it.  Of course that rapidly devolved to him shouting over people and cutting their mike.<p>I am in no way criticizing John Stewart and the Daily Show.  But I find the idea that so many people are un-ironically claiming the Daily Show as their prime news source a little bit troubling.  For example, one thing that has bothered me is the obsession with continuing to talk about stupid Republicans.  Yes, there are many stupid Republicans, saying enough stupid things to fill a 24 hour news cycle.  But in the meantime, we have a Democratic President and Congress trying to put together some of the most sweeping legislative changes in my political memory.  It is easy to put together an hour of making fun of Republicans.  But couldn't that hour be better spent analyzing the complex health care bills now being debated?  Can't we ignore the un-serious,  obstructionist Republicans for a little bit to have a good idea of what we might be getting ourselves into?<p>If John Stewart is actually doing that kind of analysis, more power to him.  If not, I would say we still need a news source in addition to the Daily Show.  Maybe Leher's show does not fit the bill, but I'm opening to hearing about a U.S. news source that's better.",1251223760

Facebook is buying back users who&#x27;s attention they have lost.<p>People are migrating to other services that offer a better experience <i>for the task at hand</i>. This is what Facebook/Google/Microsoft keep forgetting.<p>FB bought Instagram because their own photo feature wasn&#x27;t as good and that&#x27;s where they sensed people would be moving to.

7281012,comment,7279262,7279262,5,0,pirateking,,,"Trying to get a 0.0 GPA in a quarter/semester/year really is a worthy challenge. Much more difficult than you would think. I tried 3 separate times - closest I could get (without dropping from classes) was a 1.0.<p>I believe being spoiled by many of the finest computer, console, and arcade games of our time, as well as being a heavy book addict, made me bored of the &quot;correct&quot; way to play school at the rather early level of 2nd grade. So I started looking for ways to play the game to make it more fun.<p>In high school, hearing the words &quot;wasted potential&quot;, were like a trophy to me. It showed the teacher respected my knowledge (which I obtained for my own pleasure and proved at will by getting random A+s), but frustratingly knew it was not a result of the system they were paid to run. The few really awesome teachers I had, did not get this treatment. I could sense their love for knowledge, either in the way they were actually passionate about the subject they taught, and/or the way they treated students with respect. For these extremely rare few, I was willing to pretend to play by the school rules out of mutual respect for the teacher, not the game.<p>Unsurprisingly, many of these truly awesome teachers were fired or forced to transfer schools. The highly competitive high school had too many parents complaining to the school board about their kids being given a B, and even tried to convince the teachers to erase records of cheating (they being honorable ambassadors of knowledge, of course refused). This was the final proof to me that the system was a joke.<p>&quot;Wasted potential&quot;, I learned was a reference to the potential of the system to use you to perpetuate itself. It had nothing to do with your own potential future, which was always your own great responsibility (thank you Uncle Ben). I had 127 recorded absences in 12th grade. I still graduated, as I expected - the only thing more important to the school than student attendance, was public appearance.",1393044341

Vim is an awesome editor and it is the only editor I&#x27;m using now. I&#x27;ve been using it for decades and still cannot find an editor which can replace it. Sorry, emacs, I tried several times but failed. I know it&#x27;s my problem but I&#x27;m too familiar with vim&#x27;s short-cuts.<p>However, I do think we can still do some improvement on vim, especially on its plugin systems. If you wrote plugins for vim, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. For example, can you quickly tell me the differences between map nnoremap nnoremap? How to write comment in vimscript?<p>To me, vimscript seems like a language patched by lots of authors with inconsistent goals. It&#x27;s not as cohesive as Emacs Lisp. And there are lots of historical reasons why they do that --- I know, it&#x27;s backward compatibility. But you have to move forward at some time.<p>With that being said, I do think it is necessary to have an editor which keeps the good parts in vim and improve it by not considering too much about backward compatibility. I&#x27;m so glad that someone did it for us.",1393044252

7280969,comment,7280672,7280672,1,0,dhoulb,,,"I have a couple of problems with the analysis.<p>First, users don&#x27;t use WhatsApp because they&#x27;re concerned about Facebook hoovering up all the data. They use it because their slightly cooler social influencer friend uses it, so they think they should too. Regular users don&#x27;t care about Facebook from a privacy angle - they obviously do if it&#x27;s splashed across CNN, but they forget again the next day.<p>Second, a factual error:<p>> Facebook’s business model on the other hand is built on the idea that the more a user interacts with Facebook (or Facebook-connected sites and apps), the more Facebook can earn, because it can present more ads.<p>Not <i>more</i> ads — _better_ ads. They already fill all their inventory. The difference is important. Better targeted ads annoy users less, but command a higher price from advertisers. And change &#x27;giving them data&#x27; from a negative activity to a positive one!<p>Right now, Facebook&#x27;s in a weird place. They know loads about me, but their targeting is still really crap. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t just add a 5 minute &quot;improve your ads&quot; survey, where they ask outright which ads they should be showing me. I&#x27;d happily tell them the sorts of things I buy loads of, if they&#x27;d promise to only show me ads about those things. Anything to get rid of belly fat ads.<p>If Facebook stored 10 times as much data about you, but the adverts were awesome and you wanted to buy every single thing, would you give them the extra data? HN users might not, but I think most people would.",1393042682

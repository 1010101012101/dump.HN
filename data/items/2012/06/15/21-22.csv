The kindle works fine for programming books, I'm currently reading Bjarne's ""The C++ Programing Language"" on my kindle, on PDF actually. The book itself lies on my bookshelf but why would I bother to open it?<p>The PDF isn't tailored for the kindle but it has wide enough margins so that when you crop it it works quite well on the kindle. The kindle is not the limitation nor the problem.<p>The problem is rather the crippled format that you get in a fullsize PDF. What exactly are you going to read it on? Print it out? (seriously?). On your monitor? Not really... On your tablet? You're joking right, reading a book on a glossy LCD?<p>Having a book as a PDF is quite useless for other than using it as a reference.<p>Now I don't know about any potential issues with epub/mobi, and honestly I couldn't care less in this case. The site mentioned (and still does) that an ePub will be available and if so I kind of expected an ePub version of it, in my eyes that was an incentive to take the course.<p>If that isn't going to happen an ~A5 PDF will work great too, since there actually exist devices that you can read it on comfortably.<p>And I kind of have a hard time to see why the book, as it is portrayed in the HTML-version wouldn't be able to work as an epub - but OK, if that's the case (or if epub truly is just a mess) that's surely not the case for a portable-device-friendly-PDF.<p>Also, it really cracks me up to see someone talk about broken formats and in the same post make an argument for PDF.",1339797312

So that means that firms can be hybrids of this model (or at least we are).  Not sure if that's good or bad, but we are profitable (non-VC backed).<p>Our freemium gives users full almost full access to the platform (no Excel downloads) but limits the # of profiles they view.  So when they hit that limit, they're prompted to upgrade.  We also prompt for upgrade after a user has logged in a certain # of times.  The thought being that if you login 20 times, you're finding value in what we have so we should prompt you to upgrade.  We have tweaked the limits/threshholds quite a bit.<p>We used to limit # of searches in addition profile views but having so many limits was confusing to users and inhibited usage (for fear of using up their limits).  So we removed the search limits in most paid plans.<p>We primarily market to the B2B set (VCs, bankers, corporates) so our pricing is probably not the typical SaaS, i.e. it starts at $300/month.

Seriously, there are people who can indefinitely maintain a moderate habit with cookies, whiskey, cigarettes, cocaine, poker, television and Facebook; and there are people who can't, and need to go cold turkey. As it happens I'm one of the former (well I haven't tried it with cocaine, but I can do the others), but that doesn't make me a better person than the people who can't, just luckier.<p>It's also worth noting some people have found going cold turkey for a while, was enough to break the addiction such that they could then go back cautiously, in moderation.",1339794312

I had the opportunity to talk to a former U.S. Border Patrol sector chief in San Diego about the cartels.

Over-the-top, ""the goblin's spear strikes the baby dwarf in the back upper left tooth and it really hurts so he cries for mommy""? Wyvern didn't quite have that, but the API implied most of the functionality for it.<p>You didn't have inventory slots, you had body parts, which brought with them the ability to wear or wield certain other items.<p>You could've written Wyvern in a much simpler fashion.

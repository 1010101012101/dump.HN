9333292,comment,9327003,9327003,0,0,tripzilch,,,"Question for the Americans on this forum: What has the media coverage of Snowden actually been <i>like</i> in the US, then?<p>From the comments all over the web (not particularly HN), as well as John Oliver&#x27;s &quot;we didn&#x27;t cherry-pick these&quot; remark about those street &quot;interviews&quot;, I got the idea that the Netherlands, the EU, or the rest of the world has seen a wholly different news-coverage of Edward Snowden than the USA.<p>For instance, this comment on Imgur really puzzled me: <i>&quot;Watched the whole interview after seeing the last image of it that was uploaded today. Dude seems nice. A little naive, but nice&quot;</i>. That sounds as if the person who wrote this truly hadn&#x27;t seen Snowden speak and/or explain his motives before today??<p>This guy&#x27;s face has been all over the news for the past <i>two years</i>, and there have been numerous, in-depth interviews with Snowden, and live video appearances, that were in fact full of great soundbites suited perfectly for news coverage. And IMO, assuming one is remotely interested in a serious answer, some were in fact easier to understand than the few words Snowden got in between with John Oliver. Mainly because he got to finish his sentences and they asked sane questions (by which I don&#x27;t mean the &quot;Can they see our dicks?&quot; question, that one may be crass, but it <i>is</i> actually an effective summary, in some sense).<p>Somehow it seems like this appearance on a comedy show, talking about dick pics, is <i>actually</i> the first time for a great many people to hear Snowden explain himself and the issues at hand (that have been at hand for the past two years).<p>I am very on the fence about this. Taken at face value, this interview was absolutely totally cringeworthy and awful. This guy gave up his life to bring the truth to light, he is a hero[0], I&#x27;m fairly sure that John Oliver sees and agrees with this, yet he shows him a pair of rubber testicles with stars-n-stripes pattern.<p>On the OTHER hand, maybe the question &quot;But can they see our dicks?&quot; really is the last question that can make Americans actually care about this subject matter, in which case John Oliver did a great thing, if it actually works, that is wonderful. And I cringe for your country.<p>Another nice mindtwister to think about: That folder, purportedly containing a &quot;dickpic&quot; of John Oliver. Two possibilities, which one is worse: Edward Snowden, man of Truth, exiled for life, in Russia, having to play along with a semi-scripted silly comedy sketch (you can see his discomfort) pretending there is a picture of John Oliver&#x27;s penis in that folder. OR the alternative: John Oliver actually handing Edward &quot;f-cking&quot; Snowden a folder with an actual photograph of his naked penis.<p>(I&#x27;d probably have more respect for the latter, also fits better with these ridiculously Strange Times we live in. But I guess Snowden&#x27;s facial expression would have been somewhat different)<p>[0] About the &quot;traitor&quot; part. A certain number of (corrupt) people in the USA might &quot;honestly&quot; feel betrayed by him, in an informed manner. But what he did is so much bigger than that, the rest of the world knows him as a hero.",1428407914
9333291,comment,9332560,9332560,0,0,grondilu,,,"Thiel seems to hope and expect technological progress to improve people&#x27;s lives, and this seems to be the main drive for his interest in technology.  But isn&#x27;t it possible to be interested in technology for the sake of it, for the &quot;wow&quot; factor only?<p>I mean, for instance he&#x27;s very much into medicine, including anti-ageing medicine.  And it seems that the slow pace of progress in this area, when compared to progress in IT, frustrates him.  Me, I don&#x27;t care much about medicine.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m relatively healthy, but I believe it&#x27;s also because most people are healthy, so if suddenly everybody was, it would only be a quantitative change, not a qualitative one.  A healthy human body is not something new.  So, staying young and healthy until you reach say 100? Meh.<p>If the goal is to improve life, there are other ways to do that rather than waiting for technological miracles.  Money, for one.  I mean, the life of a wealthy person nowadays is, I suppose, absolutely awesome, and it does not require very advanced tech to be so.",1428407912

For example, some article comes out and gets submitted, but the submission dies out.  Then a blogger or news site mentions is, and people re-submit the article to HN all in a short time (but much later than the original submission)- which counts as an upvote.<p>Also, the first abnormal result the OP was talking about 3 votes.  I don&#x27;t think we can worry about a handful of people voting for their own startup submission.  The first, &quot;normal&quot; graph had hundreds of votes.<p>I think my takeaway from all of this is that, like other statistics, with small numbers the values have little meaning.  Now if we had seen evidence of, say, 25 or 50 people working together (a few people with multiple accounts each, for instance), then that would be more actionable evidence.

This is not bad, but different. I am not a Gentoo user so please correct me if my assumptions are wrong.

Someone tweets/emails/taps-you-on-the-shoulder and says: look at this cool thing that just happened! Being an avid HNer, what do you do? Submit to HN for the karma of course. Which results in a lot of upvotes happening in chunk. There is nothing wrong about this. How do you distinguish such behavior from outright cheating?",1428405007

TV teams usually do their yearly investigations but nothing happens.<p>Let&#x27;s not talk about price collusion in hard drives, pencils etc etc. <a href=""https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19540206&id=kyAhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0mQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2996,789994&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19540206&id=...</a><p>In fact it is quite natural for sellers to try to price-fix if you think about it.<p>The regular sellers at the produce market do not want to piss off each other and realize that selling at the bare minimum profit (or loss) would hurt them all and slowly collusion is reached. Sure a few outcasts would try to lower the prices but they quickly learn if they want to survive and be there for a longer time.\nIt happens because the cost of goods is very similar to all sellers and competing on price alone is not going to make anyone happy(not even buyers).<p>What always confused me about collusion in marketplaces like Amazon is that it seems that it would be much harder to find everyone to agree on pricing and that rebels and rule breakers would be more prevalent.",1428405005

If I&#x27;m going to write a game and I hear about WebGL, I have to make the distinction between where my art gets turned into an asset, and where that asset gets rendered.  There is a lot of ground between those two points, and understanding the difference between a library that you can just throw artwork at, and a device-driver layer that expects data in a certain format (or it won&#x27;t work at all), is where the application/engine/library lines must be drawn in the sand.<p>The author is (imho) correct in pointing this out from the perspective of having produced a tutorial for newcomers to this scene - so far my observation is that those who wish to argue with him about this point seem to want to generalize it into a ball of mystery, as they are more expert and know the territory better.  That may well be the case, but use the rear-vision mirror and look at this from a total newbie perspective.  You can&#x27;t just load up Wavefront .obj&#x27;s into a WebGL instance and expect to get a bouncing ball.  You&#x27;ll need a 3D engine - or library - to do that.  There&#x27;s room in this discussion to fill that void - for the newbie - by using terminology that allows a better understanding than, perhaps, those who understand it all, already, permit/allow/agree to.<p>The distinction seems to have a locus around the data formats - either of the files being loaded, or at the parameter/buffer-object layer.  There is quite some territory between an .OBJ vector (for example) and some other vector format that needs to be loaded into buffers and passed over to the hardware device through a driver layer.  Where does the physics go?  What is a shader for and why bother with it in this context?  These questions get answered by having firm terminology: WebGL is not a 3D library, because a 3D library would have some sort of blackbox&#x27;ed object loader, maybe a bit of physics/collision-detection too, and so on .. and it may well be an engine which uses WebGL simply as one of a series of front-ends, through a driver layer, successfully too - they&#x27;re out there.",1428404446

1488101,comment,1487704,1487704,0,0,rmah,,,"All estimation techniques follow the same pattern:<p>1) list all the components and tasks that need to be completed,<p>2) assign an estimated duration (hours or days) to each task,<p>3) add them all up and multiply by a fudge factor.<p>The problem is that none of these are easily done.  Step #1 requires a detailed understanding of what you're going to build.  Obviously, this is often impossible, but you'll just have to guess.  Be sure not to forget categories such as testing, debugging, meetings, etc.<p>Step #2 relies on experience and your assessment of the client's quality/time trade-off threshold.  If you don't have much experience, just guess and then <i>track your time</i> so you can go back and compare reality to your guesses.<p>The ""fudge factor"" in step #3 can either be hidden from the client or called ""integration phase"" or some such.  Basically, it is the process of ensuring that all the components are working smoothly together.<p>Entire books have been written on project planning and estimation.  There is no shortcut to doing it well, only experience through the school of hard knocks.<p>Good luck.",1278334676

It's true that numbers the media industry claims are ridiculous when compared against their projected growth before file-sharing took up widespread use but that doesn't mean their loss was <i>$0</i> either.",1278331473

I normally notice bad grammar (especially small errors like this), move on, and don't think again about it. Sometimes, though, the urge is too strong.<p>I do always notice, though. My mum is a former English teacher, and I have a history degree as well as a CS one. After you spend enough time editing text in your native language, it becomes second nature to notice errors and want to correct them. I accept it as the price for being able to write easily and clearly myself, without consciously worrying about grammar. In my opinion, this is a useful skill when you're a programmer. Plus I kind of like proof editing (when it's invited.)<p>The one thing that surprised me about your reply was the choice of 'money' as the metric that I can maximise by suppressing the habit. That has certainly never occurred to me. The thinking behind it seems interesting on a few levels.<p>(NB: The nature of this post, and the fact I had a few glasses of wine over dinner, mean that there is bound to be at least one grammatical error in this reply.

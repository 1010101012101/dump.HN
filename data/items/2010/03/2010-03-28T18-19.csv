UPNP has made this somewhat better but it's still no where near perfect.<p>If i'm not mistaken, much of the UDP punch-through technology was invented by Skype. However, skype still relies on a proxy server that every client connects to. It needs that so that the client can prepare the router to let data through from a certain client IP. These guys here found a ridiculously clever way of skipping this step which makes true P2P with both end points behind NAT possible and even easy to implement.",1269802799

1224967,comment,1224424,1224475,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"Right, but few people have reputation worries regarding that which is objectively bad (e.g. criminal records for serious crimes). Most of it comes down to subjective preferences and events that are open to interpretation.<p>An example: most of us would agree that there's nothing wrong with being gay, but most gay people wouldn't put it on a resume, knowing that there's still 1 out of 10 people who will have a problem with it. There's also nothing to gain, in a job search, by being public about heterosexuality. So sexual preference is (like politics and religion) just an area that many people choose to keep professionally private. One's political views <i>could</i> be beneficial-- most people would agree with my posts where I call Bush a fucking moron-- but generally people prefer to hold these cards close to their chests and be judged on their professional merits alone.<p>Privacy is necessary not only for the few who have objectively bad (drunken slut, chronic liar) things to hide but also for the much greater pool of us who have things that they might be proud of (political activism, religious views) but wouldn't want to inject into their professional lives.<p>Also, as with small towns in the past, there's the problem of reliability. Old-style small communities may have done a good job of policing some ""indiscretions"", but many have witch-burnings on their hands too... and we know those accusations weren't based in any reality whatsoever.",1269799707

First, the definition of ""crook"" seems to vary widely: some people would like to call former Pres. Clinton a crook because he had an affair. In my book, an affair may be immoral, but it should not be illegal. Second, if the 'game' in politics, as it seems to be today, is not protection of rights but allocation of loot, who do you attract?

Your css files will slowly get larger and larger, and never smaller. This leads to the next point.<p>2.) Smaller file size. Less bandwidth used, faster requests.

So far all the recent iPhone commercials I've seen only focus on the thousands of apps you can get for the iphone - not the iphone's ""awesome"" feature set. I was looking at a friend's iphone the other day and I saw page after page of 3rd party applications. My wife wanted an iPod Touch because she saw some applications she wanted. Another person I know bought an iPod Touch just so they can run a bird identification program. I don't think these are unusual cases. What's funny is that in the beginning, Apple  didn't even want to provide an API for native applications. They wanted all developers to use the Web API. When developers balked at that idea Apple reluctantly laid out plans for native applications.",1258671227

951360,story,,,16,1,c1sc0,"What I learned about the iPhone AppStore over the last 2 months",,"This summer I was tasked to evaluate the AppStore and advise our company on whether to pursue a native iPhone app or a web-based approach. I decided against the AppStore for all of the reasons that have been floating around the blogosphere & which pg has summarized more eloquently than I can.<p>But learning about the AppStore piqued my interest and I set up a little private project. This is my humble story & what I learned.<p># THE STORY<p>After brushing up on my Objective-C, I set out to build the minimal viable iPhone App. A flashlight was out of the question because I wanted something that: 1) makes people smile 2) uses <i>some</i> native iPhone functionality (accelerometer) 3) tests the AppStore approval process. Oh, and I like irony.<p>$DRUMROLL: My application named 'Reject' was APPROVED last week after two months in purgatory. $BADABING<p>Granted, the app is fairly trivial like many of the other apps in the CrappStore. This is due to the very nature of said store. Building complex apps is actively discouraged by the approval uncertainty and huge waiting times. As a beginning developer you minimize risk, pump out a few silly things while you are learning & once you are more confident you tackle a bigger project. After 2 months, I've only now started my first big project.<p>If you could all buy the app to help me recover my dev-license and dev-time, that'd be grand. If you're too poor I've reserved the 50 promo codes exclusively for HN users surviving on ramen noodles, screw the press ;-)<p># WHAT I LEARNED (CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG)<p>Here are a few dirty tricks & ideas that I hope will make life in AppStore purgatory easier:<p>Use the 'Easter Egg' field to plead directly to the reviewer. It's a free-text field that every reviewer will read and a little social engineering will work wonders.<p>If the app name is important to you, reserve it by submitting a dummy app without binary. You'll need dummy 512x512 and 480x320 artwork in order to be able to fill out the form.<p>Phone contacts at Apple are pure gold. I consistently got on the line with the same reviewer. Depending on their mood reviewers can expedite things. But it's still pretty random.<p>Set your app price low ($0.99) while it is in the review queue & jack it up immediately on release date. I got an app rejected because the reviewer did not like the price I set.<p>It pays not to be a bottom-feeder. Maximize revenue, not units of sales. Often a slightly higher price will give you more revenue. There's more than the $0.99 price-point. At a higher price point you can also afford to pay higher CPM/CPC for initial customer acquisition.<p>Count on doing your own marketing. The time when you could solely rely on rankings to boost your sales is over. The AppStore UI is so broken right now that you have to assume that your customers will <i>not</i> find your app without some effort of your own.<p>Expect long approval times. I've started thinking in development/update cycles of at least one month. Agile is not the mindset at Apple. Work on new apps while your other apps are in the queue. I wish Apple would crowdsource the approval process or look into setting up community-managed 'repositories' like Linux.<p>App Complexity <i>is</i> a good predictor of approval time. This is a big problem because it does not reward taking on the risks of building better apps. It took me 2 months to build up the confidence to start a more complex project.<p>Private API calls are an absolute no-no: even if you were approved before, your next update will be rejected because Apple started using automated tools to inspect your code.<p>If you give unlimited access to the internet through a UIWebView, your app will be pulled unless it has a 17+ rating.<p>There's no (easy) way to measure where your app sales come from. This makes traditional SEM/SEO difficult. You have no conversion numbers so your marketing funnel is broken.<p>Don't mention Apple products in your description. Don't use images of Apple products. Don't mention real-life persons in your description, I got an app rejected for that last one.<p>Don't count on being able to schedule a release date. Once you do get the approval mail, go into iTunes Connect & set your release date to $NOW. Remember, this can work both ways: I got surprised by an early release before my marketing materials were ready.<p>Yes, you <i>will</i> be pushed back to the queue upon rejection, even if you have the reviewer on the line and <i>beg</i> him to make an exception.<p>In all fairness, not all is bad. Apple seems to have started picking up speed lately. My experience with App approvals has been that it got faster in the last 2 weeks, at the same time when the AppStore itself went in disarray (wonky rankings, wrong release dates, ...). However, take care and remember ""Correlation, Causation et Al."". Also, once I was in contact with Apple over the phone they were very courteous and professional in resolving issues. Slow & polite.",1258671129

In fact msft should have been on the ball with this years ago but they were too concerned about losing revenue from licensing fees and their dominance over the desktop. Just goes to show those afraid of change will be destroyed by it.<p>It's also interesting to note that this was the computing model used 'back in the day.' Everything was dumb terminals logging into a mainframe. Looks like we had it right the first time.<p>There's always been this kind of pull between putting more smarts at the end points vs having everyone login into one behemoth multivac (mainframe back then, the Internet now). It's obvious that Google is putting its stock in the latter approach. I would go out on a limb and say that computing has been heading in this direction for a long time and companies like msft have slowed it down as long as they can but the flood gates are about to burst open..<p>This should definitely raise some eyebrows over at W3C..

Chording input, gesture interpretation, whatever you want.  No more need for a keyboard and the real estate it demands.<p>The motion sensors are already ubiquitous.  This is just a new form factor, plus probably wireless communication à la Bluetooth or similar.<p>+ Heads up in glasses (or contact lenses, or whatever) display.  Again, eliminates the need for the real estate, and power consumption, of a traditional display.  A side (or additional primary, to those who worry about these things) benefit is the recovery of privacy; shoulder surfing becomes much more difficult if not impossible, depending upon design.<p>+  Audio:  Well, that's already solved as well.

951280,comment,950751,950751,0,0,clawrencewenham,,," There are two logical flaws in this essay, and I think a misperception in the essay as a whole.<p>The first logical flaw is to point out how developers love Apple's support for developing desktop software, and then a few paragraphs later say that they [Apple] ""don't understand software"". Obviously they do understand software.<p>The second is that Apple's control over the app store review process will create a closed monoculture. So the original iPhone development model of using web apps has been forgotten already? Mobile Safari is continuing to support new standards and APIs, enabling new kinds of app to be delivered that way, and it will continue to be a competitive option for developers in the future. These apps will work in other phones and do not require an approval process.<p>The misperception of the essay is that the app store, and specifically its approval process, is evil. But this doesn't make any sense.<p>Apple just handed to small, independent developers a way to distribute their software to tens of millions of customers with a real, working single payment mechanism that is so easy it affords impulse buying from anywhere at any time. The cost to enter this program is $99--less than the cost of the phone itself and an entry barrier so low it's practically nonexistent.<p>So we now have apps developed by the recently unemployed--while sitting on their living-room couch no less--making tens of thousands of dollars in a few weeks.<p>This is unprecedented and incredible. It's one of the best things that has ever happened for independent developers since the microcomputer. And then they made it even better by adding in-app purchasing through the same payment mechanism. This is huge.<p>The inconsistency of the app rejections points to the problem of hiring and training people to interpret the policies, not the policies themselves. They aren't likely to find people who want to do that kind of work, and I'm figuring that the turnover is probably as high as it is for call centers. And given some reports that app store submissions (or at least approvals) reach 2000 per day, I would be amazed if these kinds of problems didn't happen in even the best run and most benevolent company in the world.<p>But while everybody is calling Apple evil for these growing pains, Apple is busy learning how to do App Stores. Statements made by Tim Cook, the rejection-reversals that come from higher up, policy changes and clarifications, suggest that Apple does actually care and is (slowly) improving the process.<p>Apple has a clear vision of what they want to deliver to the customer, and the review process is part of how they're trying to make that vision work. I think they're going to stick with it until they get it right.<p>I think it's likely that Apple will eventually find a way to solve these problems. When it does, it will have a competitive advantage that Android and Palm and even Microsoft won't be able to match for years: an app store that customers trust and will readily make purchases from without second thought, and a simple, painless way for independents to get their apps in. This would pave the way for an Apple TV App Store, a iTablet App Store, a Book/Magazine/Newspaper store and so-on.<p>It'll probably take a while to make it as painless as it should be for developers, because these kinds of problems are _hard_. Harder than engineering.<p>This isn't Apple's Mistake, this is an extra $100 or more per share of AAPL in the next few years.",1258669306

This is what gives natural language a higher tolerance for ambiguity, as the listener will be using generally amenable heuristics to discover meaning.<p>A programming language involves a human communicating with a generally imbecilic partner. This is like a game against a deterministic opponent, or even a single-player game, trying to optimize expression under the constraints of the language. This is what gives programming its literalness. Language designers try to solve the dual problem by designing the constraints. Arguably, the goal of a well-designed language is for the expression-under-contraints to approach the cooperative communication of natural language.<p>Legal writing is best modeled as a game against an adversarial opponent, which is actually not far from the truth. In a sense, it's also dual to language design, in that the goal is to design constraints that limit the expressive ability of an adversary.<p>While this is not explicitly mentioned in the OP, it's worth pointing out that bureaucratic writing is slightly different than legal writing, although it has a similar eliminate) the need for the judgement or ad-hoc decision-making of the individual contributors to the system, by spelling out the results of all possible decisions beforehand.

Affiliate Script is intended to make it easy for people to design Amazon product ads and put them on their blog or website.<p>If a person clicks on the Amazon product ad and buys it then the website owner gets paid a commission.<p><i>This is scary. What is happening to the money?</i><p>If the person isn't a signed up member they can make ad widgets and put them on their blog or website but they won't make any money from it.

You want a flattering but reasonably accurate advertisement for yourself, which doesn't correlate with any easily gatherable metric.  If you try to maximize clicks or emails, you run the risk of making your profile marginally more attractive to lots of people you aren't interested in at the cost of looking generic and boring to the few people you <i>are</i> interested in.  You could reduce this effect by maximizing the percentage of profile views that result in emails, but it would still be distorted by people who mistake you for someone entirely different.  If you maximize emails from interesting prospects, which is what you really want, it will take a long time to accumulate a useful amount of data.",1258668365

All of the current dating sites work by matching similar interests. This is really dumb, because most people don't want to date people with the same interests; rather, they want to date people with any compelling set of interests as long as there aren't any red flags. So rather than matching people with similar interests, dating sites should let you add tags to your profile and then let show you everyone in your area except for those with tags you are filtering out.<p>For example, show me everyone within 10 miles of 14850 except those whose profiles contain: jesus, single mom, smoker, republican, pulp-free orange juice, george bush, herpes, bbw, us weekly, horses, etc.",1210528773

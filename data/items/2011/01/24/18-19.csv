Mark, we're glad to see your new project, and we appreciate the kind words re: respect for what we do. A couple points of clarification:<p>1. We don't claim (and have never claimed) that our recommended charities are the only ones worthy of support. Our goal is to identify, and drive money to, outstanding charities; our audience is donors who want to do as much good as possible, but don't have the time/resources to research charities on their own.  We recognize that our methodology is not the only way to identify promising groups (though we believe it is most efficient for serving our audience). Think of us as investors: we work to find outstanding opportunities, but don't claim that all non-recommended opportunities are bad ones.<p>You can see more about how we think about this issue at <a href=""http://blog.givewell.org/2009/05/07/small-unproven-charities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.givewell.org/2009/05/07/small-unproven-charities...</a><p>2. In your analogy, it seems to me that the problem with ""that kid's"" behavior is that you can't unilaterally decide whom to marry. But you pretty much have your pick of where to give - there aren't any major charities that will turn you down as a donor. Given that situation, why not give to the best charity/charities you can find? We don't encourage anyone to ""sleep alone,"" i.e., not give to charity.<p>Our recommendations aren't for everyone. We recognize the value of Philanthroper as a way to hopefully get people to give more than they would otherwise, and wish you the best with this mission. We hope that you'll consider featuring our top charities among others, because - like the others you plan on featuring - they are organizations with something special to offer.",1295895421

I've been reading Gabriel's responses and in no place does he mention that keyword level data is needed for understanding differences in user behavior based on entry keyword.  This might not make a difference if you run a content site, but for any type of commerce site, I don't want to know how ""Google"" does, I want to break it down to the keyword level and better understand where efforts should be focused.<p>I also don't think that the keywords are shared with 3rd party networks explicitly.  I think what's happening instead is that you search for something, you land on a page relevant to that something, and the ad network code is reading the content on the page and assigning a keyword target or theme to your search.  For example, you might search for a Ford F-150 and you get to Edmunds and the ads are sold on a ""by make/model"" basis using ad segmentation so the ad network now can assign your cookie a ""Pickup trucks"" behavioral tag but it never had to read the referrer header, it was implied.",1295895386

Coal to diesel is horrible for the environment (twice the CO2 emissions of burning regular petroleum), but the unfortunate fact of life is that both China and the US (two biggest energy consumers) have essentially infinite supplies of coal (1000+ years at current production levels).  The US will not enact a Carbon tax in the near future because 1/2 of Americans believe stuff that is false (CO2 does not lead to global warming).  The only thing preventing large scale coals to liquids development are the huge capital costs involved and the reluctance of banks to take the risk that the price of oil will drop below the magic number ($70 per barrel).",1295895365

You can mitigate the risk by investing in bonds from a varied pool of ‘reliable’ institutions (such as governments).""<p>Bonds have many types of risk; the strength of the bond issuer is only one of them. The more common risk is interest rate risk, where you buy a bond that pays 1%, then interest rates rise to 3%, and you have to sell your bond at a loss to make it match the new 3% offerings. This affects ALL bonds, not just the ""safe"" ones. However, you can mitigate this risk by buying bonds with a shorter duration (ie ones that pay out within a couple years rather than a couple decades).<p>- ETFs<p>ETFs are a useful counterpart to normal index funds, but keep in mind that they are not quite the same. For example, unless you're getting free trades at eg Vanguard or Wells Fargo, each time you buy or sell ETF shares will cost you a fee, so it's best to buy them only if you intend to keep them at least for several years. Another notable difference is that ETFs are repriced constantly throughout the trading day, whereas mutual funds are repriced only once a trading day at the closing bell.<p>- Investing in Startups<p>If you already work in the tech industry, keep in mind that investing in your own industry ties both your income and your savings to that industry, so if the industry sinks, you're in danger of losing both simultaneously. This also applies to owning stock in your own company. Not saying don't do it, but just keep this in mind.<p>If you're really just looking for simple, sound information on where to reasonably store your savings, I recommend reading the Bogleheads Wiki at <a href=""http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>, and/or a book named ""The Random Walk Guide to Investing"".

As we all well know, Flash is incompatible with iOS and doesn't really suit touch-based interfaces for those platforms that do support Flash (eg use of rollovers and so on). That's not to say that you can't write a mobile-friendly game with Flash but, to date, most people haven't (in my albeit limited experience).<p>Facebook is, for most people, three things (IMHO): games, photo sharing and chat/messaging. FB's revenue seems built on ads and games. They're acting like they've got the market cornered on games but the don't. As Facebook usage goes mobile (as I believe it increasingly is), the draw of those games goes down and consequently so does the potential revenue.<p>Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo should already be scared to death of Apple as far as portable gaming goes.

While there are flat-rate calling plans, these are new and more commonly associated with VOIP lines.  I think that most people in the US still have plans with very complex rates based on destination and time-of-day.  For example:<p>---<p>What are AT&T basic rates? What is the AT&T basic rate plan?<p>They are the standard long distance rates charged to customers who are not enrolled in an AT&T Long Distance calling plan. There is a $4.95 monthly recurring charge associated with the state to state direct dialed basic rate plan (sometimes referred to as the basic rate plan), which applies each month whether or not a customer makes a call. The current per minute state-to-state basic rates are as follows: 42¢ Peak (7 AM - 6:59 PM, M - F), 36.5¢ Off Peak (12 AM - 6:59 AM and 7 PM - 11:59 PM, M - F) and 15¢ on Weekends. In-state basic rates vary by state.<p><a href=""https://www.customerservice.att.com/assistance/faq/qa.jsp?faqCategoryId=ld_shop_faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.customerservice.att.com/assistance/faq/qa.jsp?fa...</a><p>---<p>Incredibly, due to federal telecommunications regulations, the in-state rates have historically been higher than the state-to-state rates. What you say is true about local calls though, where ""local"" is a complex term of the art rather than something simple.  And times are changing --- for all I know, no one buy my family members are still on the traditional plans.<p>With regard to apps, I think I see it opposite to the way you do.  Previously, most small apps would be directly accessed as free websites with no metering.  Now, more of these micro-services are moving to becoming paid apps, free-loading on top of the public web sites. Would you be comfortable with the NYC metro deciding not to put up a public information site at all, and offering only a paid app?  I worry this the direction things are headed.",1295892014

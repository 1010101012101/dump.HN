If you're logged in to the website, you can add as many passengers as you want to your account, which might be handy if you purchase tickets for your family or for coworkers. My guess would be that somehow the session got into an incorrect state and is showing the passengers from one or more other accounts.<p>Also, the form is the same whether you're booking a one-way flight with one manifest, or a roundtrip with many connections where each flight has a unique manifest.

That said, I have a few issues:<p>Mobile - I often consume this kind of ""clippable"" content on a mobile device. It's limited in usefulness since it's just a browser extension (which doesn't exist on my Android)<p>Clipping UI - It can be frustrating to try and clip just the parts of a  page that i want.  The clipping box moves around seemingly randomly.  I'd expect it to work similar to how a screenshot tool works, (a rectangular square on the screen) but it appears to be scanning for parts of the web page and then offering those parts as suggestions.  This makes it difficult to just clip what I want.<p>Readability -  On the ""pinterest"" board view (sorry - that's how I think of it) - the text is dramatically shrunk, and the headlines are often clipped.  So I've got no idea what some of the clipped articles are about, unless I click them.<p>If there was a way to summarize the text instead of showing a thumbnail of the whole thing, it might be more useful.  That technique (thumbnails) seems to work well on pics, but not on text oriented clips.<p>When I do click them, they appear in a lightbox view.  The URL doesn't change unless I click through again to another view.    It'd be good to have a linkable URL in lightbox views so I could share easier.<p>Nice work though, good luck with it.

4016482,comment,4007229,4012800,1,0,tytso,,,"We do have a ring of trust which we established recently, which is rooted in cross-signed keys belonging to Linus Torvalds, Dirk Hohndel, Peter Anvin, and myself.  We all know each other quite well, both in person and via conference calls, so that was easy to set up after the kernel.org security breach.   All keys in the key ring is signed by at least two, and preferably more, other trusted keys, all leading up to the root keys.<p>But that's only important from the perspective of knowing that a particular public key belongs to a person, which in turn is only really important when a maintainer wants to know whether or not the person who signed the git tag really is the submaintainer who is claiming to have signed the git tag.<p>Most of the time, we don't really worry about identity; what we worry about is the correctness of the commit.  Especially for patches being sent via e-mail, I really couldn't care less whether the identity of the person sending the e-mail was Christoph Hellwig, or his evil twin.   I'm still going to review the patch very carefully, because we all make mistakes.  That's my job as the maintainer; to ultimately be a crap filter, and to reject crap, no matter whether it's written by someone famous or some nobody.<p>So when I send a pull request to my upstream maintainer (which in the case of ext4 is Linus), he really doesn't care about the identities of the authors in my pull request, because it is <i>my</i> reputation which is on the line; I'm the one who signed the git tag pointed to by the pull request.  Just if it gets by me, and then it gets by Linus, it's ultimately Linus's reputation which is on the line.<p>So that's why your question is a bit ill-formed.  Someone who is above me in the maintainership hierarchy isn't really going to care much about the identities of those who are below me in the maintainership hierarchy.  The trust relationship is fundamentally between me and Linus, and then I have trust relationships between me and those developers below me.  So Linus doesn't care about the identities of those which are two levels below him in the maintainership hierarchy, so long as he trusts me to have done my job properly.  Of course, if Linus discovered that I had been blindly accepting pull requests from my downstream without doing proper quality control, then he'll yell at me and he might refuse to take future pull request from me (or at least threaten to do so).  But normally, there's no need for him to verify the identity of the authors of commits in my pull request; he only needs to verify <i>me</i>, and to verify that he trusts my technical judgement and quality control checks and processes.  If decides he doesn't trust me or my technical judgement then he won't accept pull requests from me; and in that case he would be absolutely right to do so.",1337826770

Would be held in high regard? Would other ProjectManagers stick up for him? What if he led a successful project or two? Would that validate his decision to act that way?<p>...more importantly: Would you want to work for him? Is success a solid defense on being an asshole?<p>I'm perfectly happy to sit down and discuss a problem but I've got not time for assholes, tempers, or rockstars for that matter.",1337825170

The shared clips will then appear in the ""Shared"" tab for both of you. I agree with your feedback overall. We do intend to make group collaboration easier and intuitive in the upcoming product roadmap. Thanks for sharing.",1337825168
4016405,comment,4016248,4016248,5,0,tsurantino,,,"I just think the arguments fall on two spectrums.<p>On one end is that Linus is God and that he's untouchable. On the other end is that Linus is a asshole that tells everyone off.<p>The more reasonable middle being that Linus is a pretty smart guy with an incredibly history of accomplishment. He's should be respected and his way of conversing with people is particular to personality. Like, we deal with people with personalities all the time. I don't think Linus has ever, despite all his cursing, personally attacked anyone. He just attacks stupid ideas. I find his comments refreshing. You just need to give him some trust to understand why he is saying whatever he is saying.<p>I don't think that also implies that people should be unwelcoming or that people should have new ideas/opinions on what should be what. I think that Linus isn't some selfish jerk who doesn't want people to get involved with Linux. I think he just has reasonable expectations and isn't afraid to call you on your shit.<p>Cool post though.",1337825144
4016404,comment,4016259,4016259,14,0,DigitalSea,,,"What a coincidence, another baseless Dustin Curtis blog post making it's way to Hacker News once more. I have nothing personally against Mr Curtis, but this post just topped the ""Twitter is watching everything you do"" post Dustin published a week ago. Is Dustin just sitting at his computer waiting for people to screw up like Yahoo! so he can publicly vilify them?<p>Looks like Yahoo! is still the poster child for hate, only second to the PHP language of course. Fair enough Yahoo! Axis is a crappy product and perhaps someone should have said something, it's easier said than done. It takes a lot of failed products to release something good, Google are a prime example of this, look how many failed products they've released people should have internally said no to; Google Answers, Google Wave, Google Notebook, Google Buzz... Just to name a few.<p>It's a very common thing for an Internet company like Yahoo! knee deep in bureaucracy to release crappy products, and it appears as though it is a very common thing to hate on Yahoo!",1337825097

I designed a much simpler thing that connected a PC running a Visual Basic app (cut me some slack - it was 92 or so) between a SQL Server and an AS/400 machine through an ancient ISA board that was only happy under OS/2 but tolerated DOS enough to cooperate a little. It was quite an experience - at least the data arrived in ASCII.<p>I have no idea what United is running (besides the Windows ASP.NET front-end), but I wouldn't be surprised if it's something complicated enough to induce programming errors in clever people.<p>ITA's quizzes more than once inspired me on tests I subjected candidates to in order to gain a better understanding of the plumbing inside their heads.

I don't even know where to begin documenting how this ""product"" fails at its primary task so utterly.  Have you ever tried building an installer with it?  Even Apple products tried to avoid it; Final Cut Studio, for example.<p>When the Mac installer does anything, it's just as capable of littering your system with crap.<p>And the Mac uninstaller doesn't leave turds behind, because it doesn't exist.  You just have unknown crap all over your system.<p>Then there was the total lack of any way to install a single printer driver from Apple's collection until (IIRC) SnowLeopard.  You got to install half a gig of drivers for every Epson printer ever made, just to support your one printer.<p>It has been quite a while since I've had a Windows uninstaller break my system.

The Knockout documentation is quite a bit more thorough and the two way binding looks to be more robust.<p>Also, both Knockout and Angular require that you add non-standard attributes to your markup.  Whatever happened to separation of concerns?  Having used both Knockout and Backbone, I find Backbone's separation of JS and HTML to be a major benefit.  Not to mention two way binding is a neat trick, but often what I'm really after is a decent structure to hang my custom script on so I can keep it maintainable.  A lot of the code I wrote using Knockout is almost impossible to follow a few weeks later.",1337825069

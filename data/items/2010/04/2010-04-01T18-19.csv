We're located in Saudi Arabia. April fools isn't a big thing here or in the Arab world in general. But people know the concept. Today we announced that we're changing the site to become exclusively a camel rating site.<p>We even made a logo:

It could have been any form factor, even been a desktop computer with a mouse; the tablet form factor just helps it in this central regard: It's about abstracting every last thing, to the best of its designers' and engineers' abilities, away from your task at hand. The goal is nothing short doing things with all the help of a computer and none of the hindrance.",1270145928

1235141,comment,1234460,1235139,0,0,tptacek,,,"The original post was suggesting that we augment SSL by using DNSSEC to distribute cert authenticators instead of CAs. I'm saying that, for a lot of reasons, grafting DNSSEC onto web security is a solution far inferior to simply keeping TLS and solving the UI and policy problems we inevitably need to solve anyways.",1270145257

1235139,comment,1234460,1235055,0,0,mike-cardwell,,,"I'm not sure you understand what the post was suggesting. All it was suggesting is that instead of validating the SSL certificate sent by using the hardcoded certs in the browser, it's validated by doing a DNS lookup to retrieve a hash of the cert. Where DNSSEC is used to ""secure"" the validity of that lookup.<p>It could even be an addition to the protocol, so the validation is done as normal with the CA's certificates which are hardcoded in the browser, but then a DNS lookup is done as well. That would defend from unscrupulous CA's that create additional certificates for a domain and give them to government organisations.",1270145167

Maybe pro apps will be able to take off at $20 or more on the iPad.<p>On one hand, it is much less than the corresponding PC software titles, but at the same time many of the variable costs (especially testing & support) are reduced due to the cohesiveness of the platform.",1270145006

1235129,comment,1232825,1233605,0,0,elblanco,,,"> Also, the things I'd like to see, so that I don't have to build them myself, would be:
1. Worldwide address geocoding with no usage restrictions. AFAICT, this service does not exist.
2. Worldwide address canonicalization. If I'm missing a postal code, province, etc, or if a phone number is in a weird format, I'd love a service that would clean that up for me.
3. Address unification among services. I'd love to be able to tie together the primary ids of a given address among the various services: Yelp, foursquare, Gowalla, OpenStreetMap, etc.<p>I think #1 and #2 here are the most interesting -- with really limited providers to solve the problems. Address geolocation is a PIA, foreign address geolocation is even worse.<p>A non-connected private version would also be worth something (lots of money in the Government for this kind of service, usually not on the Internet).",1270144877

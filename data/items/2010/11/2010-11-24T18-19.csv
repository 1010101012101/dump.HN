1938191,comment,1936870,1937011,0,0,lmkg,,,"> A kind of best-practice report on how to use Wave productively<p>I think that, right there, is why Wave failed. It needs ""best practices"" to work well.<p>The tool on its own did not improve productivity. It needed discipline and training to learn how to use the tool, and there was a large gap between what was possible and what was useful or productive. By many people's accounts, once you cross that gap it becomes useful, but for anybody who doesn't self-identify as an early adopter, it's a non-starter.<p>Compare Wave to email, or to IM. There are people who are good at email and people who are bad at email. There are people who just don't get the medium, and are bad at communicating with it, and who could benefit from learning some email etiquette or best practices. But you know what? Even without being good at email, <i>they can still use email effectively</i>. Even when the medium is not being used to its full potential, it's still more efficient than other media. The same goes for IM.<p>With Wave, this is not the case. If you throw a bunch of people at Wave, the first thing that comes out is an unstructured, ad-hoc clusterfuck. It doesn't become useful until you standardize a process on what gets its own wave, what info goes where, and so forth. Learning to be productive in the tool is an additional step beyond learning how to use the tool. And whatever you decide, isn't enforced by the tool itself, so if someone doesn't ""get it,"" that can put information in the wrong place or disorganize stuff, and make everything confusing again.<p>Compare this to email, where there is an existing workflow defined by the Compose, Reply and Send functions. Put the text in the box, other person reads the text, and each email is a line item in Outlook. In short, all the organization that you have to invent in Wave is already present in email, and it's enforced by the tool rather than a gentleman's agreement not to make everything into a clusterfuck.<p>Wave lets you make your own rules, but it also makes you make your own rules, while email comes with its own set of rules built-in. For some people, being able to make your own rules is useful because email's are sub-optimal, but for the majority of people, email is Good Enough, and the benefit of making your own rules is worth neither the cost of having to invent your own process, or the friction of having to maintain it by fiat.",1290624768

OpenSSL 1.0 [18]. There, only the substitution table S is
stored, and then the required multiplications within GF (28)
are computed by using the following relations, which can
be realized in a highly efﬁcient way using the PCMPGTB
instruction:<p><pre><code>                     +-                           -+
                     |       +-                    |
                     |       | ff (int8_t) x > 0   |
    2•x = (x << 1) ⊕ | 1b ∧ -+                     |
                     |       | 0  (int8_t) x ≤ 0   |
                     |       +-                    |
                     +-                           -+

        = (x << 1) ⊕ (1b ∧ PCMPGTB(x, 0))
    3•x = 2 • x ⊕ x
</code></pre>
In this case, the required table contains 28 = 256 entries of
20 = 1 bytes each, and on standard x86-architectures with
a cache-line size of 26 = 64 bytes we have that only l = 2
bits of each x∗ are leaked. Looking at Table 1 now shows
that we have p3 = 1, i.e., every k∗ ∈ {0, 1}4·2 is a valid
partial key-column candidate for every x∗ and y∗ . For this
reason, our key search algorithm does not work anymore.
Because of the large prevalence of AES another mitigation
strategy is currently embarked by software vendors. Namely,
they are increasingly often offering hardware support of
AES in their chips, e.g., [25], rendering access-driven cache
attacks impossible.<p>'''",1290622689

Find a group of people with strongly held beliefs that exhibit a lot of cognitive dissonance, and exploit them.<p>A great example is the atheist who offers to take care of pets for people for after the rapture.  He does a great job of exploiting people's strongly held beliefs, but aligns their interests with his (""look you'll be happy in heaven, but what about your poor pets?  since i'm not going to heaven, I'll look after them!"").

But in this context, it <i>is</i> a scare word. When you write a blog that seems to be a pop topic blog for a wide audience, in today's world 'derivative' <i>is</i> a scare word. The average news paper reader hadn't heard about 'derivatives' before 2008, and since then he heard about it every week, usually in the context of how much money they have cost some firm, how much money they have cost the tax payer, how much money they have cost pension funds, or how much money they have made for those greedy bankers in Wall Street, London, Frankfurt or wherever - or a combination thereof.<p>So yes, 'derivative' <i>is</i> a term with negative connotations to the wider public. It is one of the words that are now associated with irresponsible risk and money out of thin air. It's irrational to blame the use on the instrument, but hey, it's an irrational world out there.",1290622181

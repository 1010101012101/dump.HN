Since that time, social networks and email providers such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn and Yahoo! have embraced open identity standards. And now, billions of people who have created accounts with these services can use their identities to easily register and login to sites across the web in the way myOpenID was intended.<p>By 2009 it had become obvious that the vast majority of consumers would prefer to utilize an existing identity from a recognized provider rather than create their own myOpenID account. As a result, our business focus changed to address this desire, and we introduced social login technology. While the technology is slightly different from where we were in 2006, Im confident that we are still delivering on our initial promise  that people should take control of their online identity and are empowered to carry those identities with them as they navigate the web.<p>For those of you who still actively use myOpenID, I can understand your disappointment to hear this news and apologize if this causes you any inconvenience. To reduce this inconvenience, we are delaying the end of life of the service until February 1, 2014 to give you time to begin using other identities on those sites where you use myOpenID today.<p>Speaking on behalf of Janrain, I truly appreciate your past support of myOpenID.<p>Sincerely,\nLarry",1378317002

Computational linguists do use them, with a <i>lot</i> of caveats and careful analysis of confounding factors.<p>One simple one that comes to mind here is that you need to analyze to what extent changes over the period of the data set are caused by underlying societal changes, versus changes in the NYT itself; the end result will be a mixture of those two changes, some of which may be magnifying and others offsetting. The 1980 NYT and the 2013 NYT are not the same newspaper, not edited by the same people, not sold to the same readership demographics, and not soliciting the same advertisers, so it&#x27;s somewhat questionable to treat it as a stable proxy for a social group.<p>Another common pitfall is language change screwing up all kinds of measures (since n-gram models just work on word counts). For example, if two words are used roughly interchangeably in 1980, but by 1990 one of them has fallen out of usage, and been replaced wholly by the other one, searches for just the one word will look like the word&#x27;s on an upwards trend, but it would be misleading to infer an increase in the underlying concept over the period. Of course, you can account for this by merging words into equivalence classes (most analyses will do basic stemming and merging of alternate spellings), but you have to be very careful to get all the equivalence classes (which is not a well-defined notion). Just a list of the top words in a year will tend to be some mixture of 1) top concepts; and 2) concepts expressed using only a small number of wording variations, so their count doesn&#x27;t get diluted.",1378316212

If they hadn&#x27;t rewritten their code how would have history changed? Would we be where we are today? How many years behind would that setback have put us? The release of Firefox was instrumental at disrupting and evolving the web. With a poor code base could they have done that as effectively as they did?<p>A company may be transient, and killed by choices that hurt them in the short run, but will support them in the long run. But good open source code is eternal. The quality speaks for itself. Their decision may have killed their company but it was astronomical for the web. From a higher level perspective, they did the right thing, and it shows that good code is so powerful, it can even outlive the company that made it.",1378316138

But consider the specific changes made:<p>&quot;In the past, admissions gave preference to people with lots of previous programming experience. The new criteria focused on potential by targeting students who showed science and math aptitude as well as non-academic strengths like leadership. The department made it explicit that no prior experience was required.&quot;<p>None of these measures seem to me to discriminate against men. Also, the enrollment gender ratio of 40-60 isn&#x27;t that far off from the representation of women and men among high school students who score 750 on the SAT Math (CMU&#x27;s interquartiles for SAT Math are 690-790), which is roughly 35-65.<p>MIT&#x27;s experience evening out its gender ratio is illustrative. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find the link right now, but MIT found sometime in the 1990&#x27;s that women were outperforming their admission predictors, based heavily on SAT scores, relative to men. So they rebalanced their admissions process to put less emphasis on SAT scores and more emphasis on high school GPAs.<p>Also, &quot;equality&quot; here is a more complex issue than you&#x27;re making it out to be. Social conventions are self-perpetuating. You can&#x27;t just remove the overt discrimination and assume things will shift back to a healthy equilibrium. Once you have bent a metal beam outside the elastic region you can&#x27;t just remove the external force and wait for it to straighten itself out! Illustrative here is the legal industry&#x27;s experience with fairly aggressive affirmative action for women in the 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s. Law firms went from being 95% men to being almost even, and that new equilibrium was self-perpetuating. The ratio stayed roughly equal even after the measures were phased out.",1378315920

6328995,comment,6326774,6328157,6,0,Daiz,,,"Dithering can help a lot when it comes to displaying large smooth gradients in lower bit depths. Obviously it has its downsides, though - for one, you need to actually implement it where smooth gradients are used, and at when it comes to video games this basically never happens and you end up with notable banding instead.<p>Dithering in the field of video is pretty common, though. But it has a pretty large problem there as well - since dithering is essentially noise, it requires a lot of bitrate to compress efficiently, and if you don&#x27;t have bitrate to throw at your source, you&#x27;re most likely going to kill it and just end up introducing banding. Blu-ray is pretty much the main avenue where you have enough bitrate to spare for proper dithering in 8-bit video. Anything less than that, though... well, let&#x27;s just say that House of Cards on Netflix was suffering from banding a lot.<p>Banding is actually one of the biggest reasons why anime fansubs these days are generally encoded in 10-bit H.264. Anime tends to have a lot of large and smooth color surfaces and banding was pretty much the hardest thing to avoid with regular 8-bit video - 10-bit on the other hands makes it an almost total non-issue. And for non-10bit displays, it moves the necessary dithering to the playback end, which is obviously a much nicer alternative since you don&#x27;t have to compress any of that in the video itself. And beyond the gradients, 10-bit H.264 actually gives you better compression quality in general, which just makes it even better.<p>Now, it obviously comes with the downside of not being supported by hardware decoders anywhere, so you basically will need a decent CPU to decode 10-bit video. For fansubs and the people who make them this isn&#x27;t that much of an issue though, since the advanced subtitles they use are also generally poorly-supported by hardware players, and this has been the case for a long time.<p>Next-generation video formats may actually bring higher bit depths to hardware decoders as well, though - H.265/HEVC has a Main 10 Profile intended for consumer applications.",1378315342

Meanwhile, he will have to go back to the international lecture/meet/greet circuit that pulls in the jobs and maintains their reputation for world class architecture.<p>The project team will then usually have a very tight deadline to produce the initial design, probably mostly drawn up by a team of recent architecture graduates who would be pretty low paid[1], and who will almost always end up working very long hours and weekends unpaid overtime to meet the deadline. Where the lead architectural practice is not based in the UK there will also be a local architect who will advise on local regulations, prepare the submissions for planning permission and generally deal with other regulatory authorities.<p>There will also be a large consultant team on a project of this scale. Probably consisting of two teams of civil engineers; one for superstructure and one for substructure. A geotechnical expert for the foundation design. A whole spread of HVAC engineers, probably separate mechanical, electrical, drainage and ventilation specialists. A facade engineer who specialises in problems specifically to do with the design of the glass cladding system. A fire engineer to design the fire escape strategy and help negotiate the fire fighting strategy with the local fire brigade. A vertical circulation engineer to design the lift and escalator strategy. A bomb blast engineer to model the effects of various bomb attack scenarios on the cladding and structure. A security consultant to advise on how defendable the building is and to design the cctv, active tramp deterrent systems :-( etc. Finally a quantity surveyor will advise on how much this will all cost.<p>All of these people will have been consulted briefly, probably mostly by video conference, across a couple of time zones, before the planning permission submission[2]. All their requirements have to be juggled between the different disciplines by the architect. As an architect who has done services coordination on skyscrapers and international airports, I can tell you it&#x27;s not easy. One of the most frustrating things is that engineers from different disciplines don&#x27;t talk to each other, even if they are working for the same firm. On top of this, the time allowed to prepare the planning submission will be a few months at most, and a lot of the effort will be spent on optimising the design and more importantly the presentation strategy to get through the planning permission process.<p>Once the planning permission submission has been approved, the overall shape of the scheme is fixed and hence the parabola shape can no longer be designed out. Therefore, if no-one notices a problem like this until after the planning submission, or perhaps fails to get someone higher up to take it seriously enough to change the concept design, then they will have to remedy it by using special anti glare coatings or just plain hoping it wont be too bad. This is for a couple of reasons: because the developer will be exerting large pressure to speed up construction as they will be paying a large amount of interest on the loan for the cost of the land, because consultancy fees to redo the design would be in the order of millions at this point and because getting planning permission for a scheme like this is very politically controversial so you don&#x27;t risk doing it twice if you can avoid it.<p>So, you can probably see how something like this could easily have happened.<p>[0] Because it&#x27;s pug ugly, not because of the solar death ray thing, that&#x27;s quite amusing really.\n[1] Something like 20k per year in London, which is a crap salary after 6 years in University.\n[2] In the UK this is a semi-democratic consultation process which occurs at local government level and involves publicly presenting the designs to local councillors to give residents of the area a chance to raise a formal objection.",1378315104

There have been cases of recreational drugs effectively disappearing due to changes in law or de facto bans. It has happened especially with pharmaceuticals. Quaalude, a prescription sleeping pill, was popular recreationally in the 70s and early 80s (see, e.g., Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Up In Smoke), but it was put into schedule I of the CSA in the mid 80s, which made it illegal for all purposes. Supposedly, there were bootleg versions for a short time, but it has long since faded into legend (control of precursor chemicals might have been the final decisive blow). The same happened with many prescription drugs of the 60s and 70s, which were either banned outright, severely restricted, and/or voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer due to pressure. Barbiturates used to be popular, but, although they&#x27;re currently in schedule II and not banned outright, they&#x27;re prescribed so infrequently that they&#x27;re as good as gone. The most recent prescription to disappear due to gov&#x27;t action was Rohypnol (but I suspect the popularity of this drug was overblown). If you read the text of the CSA, you&#x27;ll find a long list of obscure names of drugs of all types that are not actively traded anywhere on earth, some of which probably never had significant markets, but others of which certainly did, or could have. It&#x27;s true that overall, drug prohibition has been fantastically ineffective at eliminating drug use; cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana continue to flood in, supplied by international drug trafficking organizations. But there&#x27;s a cat-and-mouse game that goes on, and some drugs more than others are vulnerable to government action.",1378314791

It was basically a clone of logshare.com that I wrote in my spare time with PHP. It was my first really &#x27;big&#x27; project. You can see the code here: <a href=""https://github.com/priestc/old-flightloggin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/priestc/old-flightloggin</a><p>If you look around that codebase, you&#x27;ll see nothing but spaghetti. I starting writing the app in late 2007, back when you could say I was a &#x27;noob&#x27; (so noobish in fact, I didn&#x27;t even use source control). At the time I thought I was writing the most awesome code ever. By the middle of 2008, that project had reached a state where it was pretty much &#x27;done&#x27;. I then stopped working on that codebase, and moved on to other projects.<p>Then by late 2008, FlightLogg.in&#x27;s traffic had kept growing, and there was a list of bugs and really cool features that I had thought up since I last touched the codebase a few months earlier. I set out to continue development on the PHP codebase. The problem was that in the past few months I&#x27;ve been away, I had become a better programmer, and the sight of that spaghetti code made me vomit.<p>It was less about the code being &#x27;bad&#x27;, and more about me not remembering how things worked. The small set of fetures and fixes I wanted to make would have taken me a few hours to do back when I was first working on this codebase. Since a few months time had passed, it was taking me much longer.<p>Eventually I decided to do a complete code rewrite. This was before I ever saw that Joel Spolsky article. The new codebase is here: <a href=""https://github.com/priestc/flightloggin2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/priestc/flightloggin2</a> It took me roughtly the same amount of time to build the new codebase as it did the old codebase.<p>Ever since, each and every project I take on, I accept the reality of doing a complete code rewrite might come up. For my own personal projects, I do complete code rewrites all the time. On the other hand, at the various jobs I&#x27;ve had over the years, its a much different story. If I came into work today and brought up the idea of doing a complete code rewrite, I&#x27;d either get laughed out of the room, or even worse, threatened with being fired, thanks to this Joel Spolsky article.

Don&#x27;t take it personally.  Maybe instead of getting defensive, ask, &quot;Have I ever done anything to make you feel like that or disempower you?  Please let me know in private if I ever do or anyone else working here does.  I don&#x27;t want to make you feel that way, I don&#x27;t want to implicitly model that behavior in front of other people, and I don&#x27;t want other people to feel they have the license to do it.&quot;<p>When feminists talk about &quot;allies&quot; they mean folks who both say and inhabit this sort of thing.",1378314001

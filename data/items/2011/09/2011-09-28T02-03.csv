Sure it costs more to install residential than commercial or utility scale, but the higher revenue more than offsets this.  Also all PPA or leases are long term arrangements where the provider includes an escalator of at least 2% a year.  If utility rates don't rise at least that fast, the long term contract is a bad deal for the buyer.",1317178139

3046228,comment,3045269,3045467,5,0,droithomme,,,"It's a known problem to preannounce next generation products. Once you announce that the next generation is coming out soon, the value of the current version is discounted in people's minds. Hm, should I buy the 2011 model now, or wait a couple months for the 2012 model. The problem is when, unlike car models, the 2012 model doesn't come out when one expected and is indefinitely delayed. This can put a company in a position where sales dramatically slow down because people are waiting for the imminent next release, but the release is not forthcoming. More than one company has gone under in this conundrum. The solution to extricate oneself from the mess is to announce that the next version is free for all purchasers of the current one. Then people waiting for the next version will say hey why not I will get the current one while I am waiting rather than wait. These people only purchased because they were assured they were really buying the next version, and the current one was to tide them over. It is similar to when you buy a car and it is delayed so the dealer gives you a loaner car until it arrives. Customers would be quite disappointed, having bought a car and lent a loaner, to find that the dealer felt the loaner was good enough for them and if they want the car they bought they should pay a second time.",1317178002

This communication gap between requirements and specification has always plagued engineering, so I find the user story a nice compromise for web apps. This compromise is only effective, however, when the communication channel is there, and as you point out in your post, it often isn't.<p>I'm curious what your thoughts are in terms of bridging this gap so that developers build what the product owner has in mind. It's one thing when everyone involved is a great communicator, but how do you play the game when, for example, you have a client who says something like, ""As an admin, I want a button in the upper left corner, so I can click it and be brought to a list of posts""?",1317177303

Well here is a quick and easy way to test your antivirus. The process is called EICAR test which will work on any antivirus and was developed by European Institute of Computer Antivirus Research. This process can be used by people, companies and antivirus programmers to test the proper functioning of the antivirus/antimalware software without having to deal with the real computer virus which can cause damage to the computer. Here is a step-by-step procedure to test your antivirus.<p>1. Open a notepad (New Text Document.TXT) and copy the following code exactly onto it, and save the notepad.<p>EICAR Test code
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
2. Rename the file from New Text Document.TXT to myfile.com<p>3. Now run the antivirus scan on this myfile.com file.<p>If the antivirus is functioning properly on your computer, then it should generate a warning and immediately delete the file upon scanning. Otherwise you may have to re-install your antivirus.<p>NOTE: Most antivirus will pop-out a warning message in the Step-1 itself
You can also place the myfile.com file in a ZIP or RAR file and run a scan on it so as to ensure whether your antivirus can detect the test string in the compressed archive. Any antivirus when scanning this file will respond exactly as it will do for a genuine virus/malicious code. This test will cause no damage to your computer even though the antivirus will flag it as a malicious script. Hence it is the safest method to test the proper functioning of any antivirus.",1317177153

This also tends to trump everything else, even the cost of an acquisition or its quality (frankly, many IT departments have a CYA policy).  Even <i>free</i> software that is demonstrably superior in every way to some overpriced enterprisey solution could be shot down if it's not clear how someone would install and maintain the app, and if it's not clear where to go if the app exploded tomorrow.<p>While it <i>is valid</i> to question how an app will be supported, I think that IT departments tend to give this too much weight and spend too little time thinking about what else they might do.  ""Run screaming to tech support person from vendor"" is not a disaster recovery plan, but in too many organizations that seems to be all there is.<p>What is the probability of an incident?  How severe can the problems be?  Would those problems have work-arounds?  And ultimately, can all critical data be accessed and backed up regularly just in case of a failure?  In the well-designed free software that I've seen, these questions have great answers and there's usually some bonuses like support forums, source code, and hundreds of known users worldwide.  In other words, risk is pretty small and there is definitely some reward, but it requires your IT people to actually invest a little time to learn and to keep things moving (for example, to install new versions regularly and to brush up on scripting skills).",1317176210

But the problem is that giving Japanese programmers good frameworks and libraries is not as easy as just handing them a package and being done with it. The pace of modern frameworks like Rails etc. is so fast that there is a big learning curve just getting used to staying in the loop.<p>We lost at least a week on a project Im working on catching up when Rails 3.1 hit, because all these useful things (asset pipeline, etc.) require effort to tie into existing practices. Imagine the Japanese developer with limited English skill, trying to navigate the discussion threads like this one ( <a href=""https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/issues/337"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/issues/337</a> ) (just as an example). Its a lot of work.<p>So I think what happens is that, although re-inventing the wheel is a hell of a job, at least it means that the basic groundwork is constant and designed internally, whereas using frameworks means that youre building on someone elses work  usually non-Japanese, so not well documented in Japanese.",1317176156

(Whether or not it's an actual subsidy or just a nice bit of profit for the cable network/provider is anyone's guess.)<p>Obviously, without legislation, the internet will end up being no different, with Comcast, AT&T, and ultimately high-traffic sites like espn.com nickel-and-diming each other and end users.

Let me comment on why I posted this.<p>First, we've (the founders) have been doing all of the customer acquisition work since day one... but the realities of the demands that are splitting up our focus are that none of us have the time that this role requires to focus on this properly.  We know and understand where our customers are, how to reach them, etc... but customer acquisition isn't a set it and forget it problem.  It requires constant attention, tweaking, optimizing and experimenting.  We certainly won't be just handing this off to someone, but we're at a point where someone has to dedicate their full time and attention to the job.<p>100% agree that comments being disabled on job posts is limiting.  That's why I decided to do the blog post... to get some feedback from the HN community on this type of role. Hopefully this is something we can talk pg into changing :)<p>The original job post I put up was actually intended to be presumptuous, I wanted to see if anyone would self select into responding with the vague details I put up there.  Honestly I didn't know how to build this job post because it's not a traditional role, although from the community of founders I spend time with, it's an increasingly in-demand type of position.  It's not 100% marketing and not 100% technical... The Airbnb job post focuses a lot more on the technical side of things and knowing that HN is a more technical crowd I wasn't sure how to position the marketing side of things.<p>I'm going to re-do the job post after hearing all the great feedback both on our blog and on HN.  The typical stuff about why someone should apply will be included...<p>Thanks everyone.",1291157899

1955901,comment,1954852,1955238,0,0,jon914,,,"Sure, I'll list out some of the pain points we're aware of and have tried to address.<p>- Not able to think logically. 
There's only so much you can accomplish if you take logical thinking out of the equation, and when you do, the creations are underwhelming. Many startups set out to make creation <i>easy</i>, and that works to some extent, but the real solution to the problem may be to try to educate users and bring them up to a minimum bar (learn how to fish), rather than trying to lower the bar to the floor (give them the fish). This would be suicide for most startups, but the users of creative apps are more patient and more willing to learn and grow with the app. Sure, we'll shut out some people this way, but we want to lift up the right, motivated people, rather than trying to lift the entire world up.<p>- Can't draw/other artistic skill. 
Shockingly, this ends up being a big problem, and people absolutely <i>hate</i> using placeholder art if they can't draw. We've addressed this by integrating a marketplace for pulling in all kinds of resources.<p>- Can't work with other people. 
Many game projects fail due to bad communication (if you're not working solo). They start out strong when brainstorming and then die somewhere in the middle, usually when the members fall out of regular contact or don't know what's going on. We've integrated some features into our app to directly address this after observing how our users interacted with each other on several group projects.<p>- Set their sights too high. 
No, you're not going to create an MMORPG or RTS as your first project. ;) This one isn't directly addressed by our app right now and falls more under the umbrella of general user education and progression. One idea we have is to incorporate game elements (turning game creation into a game?) to nudge the user towards making baby steps towards completing something through a quest structure, rather than trying to let them go free from day 1.<p>The take home point is that like any startup, what you set out to do ends up evolving as you move along and that the problem you're solving turns out to be different and sometimes larger than what you originally expected.",1291157044

People who are already successful already <i>know</i> this stuff.  At least to me, this sort of list feels like it's being aimed at people who haven't ""made it"" yet and are still trying to figure ""it"" out.<p>When I was in High School a friend of mine named Steve Fisher said something that I doubt he remembers, but has stuck with me.  He was trying to teach me how to skateboard, something that was totally <i>not</i> the type of activity that a nerdy, awkward, 15 year old Ryan thought he could do.  So we're sitting at the skatepark and there are lots of other people around doing what I thought were difficult tricks.  I was sitting on a bench just watching and trying to think of a valid reason not to ride my skateboard around because I was 100% positive that I was going to fall flat on my face and that all of the other people were going to laugh at me.<p>My friend comes over and says ""What the hell are you doing?""  ""Oh, I was, err..just, uhh, tightening these bolts.""  ""Bullshit, did you figure out how to ollie it yet?""  ""No, dude, I'm just going to practice at home in my room more until I can figure it out, I don't want to get in everybody's way.""<p>He told me that I had to just go ride the thing in circles until it felt natural, and that if he saw me sitting on the bench again, I wasn't invited to the skatepark anymore.  I rode my skateboard around all afternoon, probably fell on my face a few times, but didn't get laughed at even once.<p>A stupid story, probably.<p>How does this apply to startups?<p>Maybe it's just the communities I hang around in, but many coders are really really <i>not</i> like the skaters in my story.  They really <i>will</i> laugh at the kid riding his skateboard in circles (writing twitter clones and craigslist mashups) like an idiot.  How many designers have posted tirades to their blog talking about how everybody is stupid, and how they're sick of all these <i>stuuupid</i> people asking them to do designs?  To me, lists like this are <i>exactly</i> like telling a kid that he's riding his skateboard in circles and to stop wasting his time doing that.  If you can't show up and start doing backflips, then don't waste your time even coming.  People have already figured out how to ride in circles.<p>Anybody whose time would be wasted writing yet another dating website doesn't need a list like this to tell them that.

However, he's making an assumption that I think is unfounded, which is treating the concentration of political power as monolithic. If you assume that an organization is concerned about the power of the organization, then I think he's correct in his logic that authoritarianism leads to conspiracy and communication is important to having power. However, if you assume that most members of an organization are concerned with personal power rather than the power of the organization, then the importance of communication goes down sharply, as the only coordination is opportunistic. A bureaucracy, as opposed to a dictatorship, is quite content without having goals, coordination, or communication[1], and can expand its authority based entirely on the mission creep of lower-level individuals within it.<p>How valuable the disruption of communication is in fighting a ""regime"" depends on how you model that regime. And, of course, in practice you will find that reality is some bizarre chimera of any group of models. My intuition is that Congress (plus lobbyists) act more like a decentralized bureaucracy, executive administrations act more like dictatorships that fight against each other for territory, and that the closest things we find to Assange's ""banal conspiracies"" are small, ad-hoc, opportunistic alignment of objectives, much smaller, less powerful, and less stable than the government as a whole.<p>[1] In fact, lack of coordination could help a bureaucracy grow by fostering redundancy.",1291156790

I've copied out what I think are the key bits, the following is all quoted:<p>He begins by positing that conspiracy and authoritarianism go hand in hand, arguing that since authoritarianism produces resistance to itself -- to the extent that its authoritarianism becomes generally known -- it can only continue to exist and function by preventing its intentions (the authorship of its authority?) from being generally known. It inevitably becomes, he argues, a conspiracy ...<p>the most effective way to attack this kind of organization would be to make ""leaks"" a fundamental part of the conspiracy’s  information environment. Which is why the point is not that particular leaks are specifically effective. Wikileaks does not leak something like the <i>Collateral Murder</i> video as a way of putting an end to that particular military tactic; that would be to target a specific leg of the hydra even as it grows two more. Instead, the idea is that increasing the porousness of the conspiracy’s information system will impede its functioning, that the conspiracy will turn against itself in self-defense, clamping down on its own information flows in ways that will then impede its own cognitive function. You destroy the conspiracy, in other words, by making it so paranoid of itself that it can no longer conspire ...<p>The leak, in other words, is only the catalyst for the desired counter-overreaction; Wikileaks wants to provoke the conspiracy into turning off its own brain in response to the threat. As it tries to plug its own holes and find the leakers, he reasons, its component elements will de-synchronize from and turn against each other, de-link from the central processing network, and come undone.<p>... he quotes Theodore Roosevelt’s words from his 1912 Progressive party presidential platform as the epigraph to the first essay; Roosevelt realized a hundred years ago that ""Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people,"" and it was true, then too, that ""To destroy this invisible government, to befoul this unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of statesmanship.""",1291156258

Every merchant account agreement reads the same -- if anything causes them to consider your account a higher risk than when it was first approved, they can open a reserve account and hold your money. If they suspend your account they will hold your money for exactly 6 months. It's the same everywhere.<p>These aren't things to consider when using PayPal, they're things to consider when you start accepting credit cards through anyone. You must plan for the possibility of having your account suspended at any time and for having whatever money hasn't yet been paid to you held for 6 months. Know who you're going to turn to if it happens and, if you've got the development time, integrate it with your site and be ready to turn it on when needed.<p>Here's a business idea for HN: build a payment platform that's processor/gateway agnostic. It'll need to have an API for directly taking credit cards, then pass that on to whatever payment processor you've plugged into it to make the charge. It'll also need an API to generate payment buttons for 3rd party processors like PayPal and Google Checkout. If one of them closes your account, you just plug in the login credentials of another and your website keeps running without changing any code. The recurring-payments-as-a-platform providers are half way there, but there's plenty of space for a different abstraction that doesn't focus on recurring payments.<p>I've already done so many payment integrations I probably have most of the code to create such a service, but the security and legal stuff you'd need to handle are significant enough that it really needs to be a full-fledged startup, not a side project.",1291155169

That is, good Prolog code only likely to be slow because of it's backtracking when an imperative solution would have been slower/buggier.<p>Runtime slowness because Prolog is a dynamically-typed language that also strongly encourages the development of meta-intepreters as a common tactic is a separate issue. Often times a slower run time is acceptable in exchange for a much faster development time with the use of custom metalanguages (DSLs).<p>Integrated search aside, another benefit of logic programming comes in declarative knowledge representation.

Nor does it make me realize ""just how defensive and demoralized and miserable the corporate workers really are.""<p>The essay does not claim that anyone who works in a corporate job is miserable.  What is does say is that people would be happier if they were working for themselves (or in a small company).  I don't have to be miserable to have potential to be happier.",1206316226
144170,comment,143148,143185,0,0,icky,,,"> The essay does take advantage over the common ""naturalistic fallacy"", where people imply something as being ""good"" from its being ""natural"".<p>The essay avoids that fallacy by making the case that humans, having evolved under certain social conditions, might be much better equipped at present to cope with similar conditions.  This itself may be true or false, but it is not fallacious reasoning.",1206316061

There are a couple of different categories of interaction:<p>I don't want to lose a key e-mail from someone new (e.g. a prospect) or someone I want to reconnect with (e.g. an old friend) in the midst of everything else<p>I want to have some answers suggested based on a collection  of blog posts, a FAQ, or some other knowledge repository.<p>I want to recombine a number of e-mails into a complex branching thread because that's a work flow that a team I am a member of embraces (see <a href=""http://www.43folders.com/2008/03/12/patterns-email-conversation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.43folders.com/2008/03/12/patterns-email-conversat...</a> ) so that I have the full context for the conversation.<p>I want to make sure I don't lose touch with folks I have had a prior shared success with (I would like to boost my effective dunbar number).<p>There are several others. Please feel free to contact me directly if you would like to continue the conversation. I think this is one area that is overdue for a significant change in paradigm, the evidence that the current approach isn't scaling can be found in a variety of secondary and tertiary coping behaviors that we have come to accept without attacking the root cause. I think there will be many approaches that continue to use SMTP as a transport protocol but enhance the user interface with embedded analytics and automation, as well as adding alternative forms of response to include blogging, wikis, IM, and VoIP.<p>see also <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=143878"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=143878</a>",1206315753

144161,comment,143735,144099,0,0,icky,,,"Indeed, but the mere subjectivity of a statement doesn't deprive it of the possibility of truth or falsehood for any given person or group of people.<p>For example, take the statement ""bread is a better food than dung.""  In my own context, and yours, and probably all of humanity's, that subjective statement is more-than-subjectively true.<p>For a fly or a dung beetle, that statement is false.<p>Given the right context and constraints, even subjective statements can be ""objectivized"" and tested scientifically.<p>For instance, if you can decide on various goals or constraints, you could find out objectively whether the startup life or the corporate life tends to be <i>better</i> in terms of more money, less stress, quality of life (once you've carefully stated metrics for that), etc.<p>So, in the strictest sense, the original poster is right, in that <i>by itself</i>, neither the startup life nor the corporate life is better, just as in the strictest sense, the statement ""bread is a better food than dung"" is neither true nor false.  But stopping there can deprive you of valuable information, which might prevent you from eating dung. ;)",1206315217

144158,comment,144105,144125,0,0,tim2,,,"The TC article title clearly says that artists should not be compensated for recordings. No context, that's the title and therefore the overall message that Arrington wants us to take away. What most of the article says is that the artists shouldn't expect to be able to retroactively be compensated when they had previously agreed not to be in this particular situation.<p>The problem here is that, all context considered, Arrington is going one step further than just saying that the artists don't deserve compensation here. He is very clearly raising the point that artists shouldn't expect to be compensated at all for recordings ever.<p>Of course this is quite disapointing to me as much of the music I listen to cannot be created live by its artists but instead takes days or months to prepare. With the advancement of computers, more and more often, musical composers will be able to use just a computer to create music that traditionally could only be created by live musicians - and lots that can only be created through computers.

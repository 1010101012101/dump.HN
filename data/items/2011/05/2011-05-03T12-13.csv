2509749,comment,2508883,2508883,1,0,rglover,,,"What Ben is getting at is that a truly good designer is a person who has little aversion to what medium they're working on. Additionally, I think he's also coded in a bit of a slant toward most of the businesses out there that are hiring who only associate design with certain products or languages. An honest mistake, sure, especially for those who don't know about design.<p>But we're beginning to enter an era where if you run a business and your adement about having a well-designed product, then you should be willing to take the time to develop a cursory knowledge of the industry. Be able to differentiate between buzzwords and the all-too-familiar ""insert development platform here"" designer. Although his argument is a bit understated, Ben's point is clear: don't waste time with people who aren't absolutely head-over-heels about design. They cost more and sometimes require more resources, but the return on that investment will surprise most people. Even if they don't believe it, people respond to good design.",1304427372

But I have spent over 30 years working with some great developers on a wide range of projects and I have seen what works and what does not work.<p>A few years ago the art of architecting systems for scalability and extensibility started to get a bad press. I think Joel Spolsky was the first to coin the phrase architecture astronauts, to describe those who were always designing layers of abstraction but forgetting to deliver code that actually did anything.    Then we got the lean start up movement, focusing on the constant iteration that the web enables.<p>This led to the hacker culture, oriented to just do it speed. Hacker used to be a term of abuse, but like punk it was adopted by those accused as a badge of pride.<p>That is all good stuff, but methinks it has gone too far. We now see too many systems where the original system has to be totally thrown away. That may be OK if you raised $ gazillions and can now compete with Google and Facebook for a big team of really great engineers. But for most startups, it is not possible. So most startups limp along with the original system. The upshot is:<p>Hosting bills that really start to bite into cash flow.
Systems that crash too often; a few of these and your users have clicked away to a rival. Yes, we persevered through Twitter fail whales, but is your service really that addictive?
New features take way too long. You either release fast or put in some QA and testing process to avoid brand-killing crashes.
It does not need to be like that. The best developers can do both. They create a scalable and extensible architecture AND deliver quick feature iterations. Sometimes you cannot get one person who can do both  it is rare. One team I worked with solved this by having a 4 person team where:<p>1 person hacked demos, in the full knowledge that the code would thrown away. He was awesome at this and in full synch with his colleague who:
created the architecture AND the working code.   35 years later, the system is still being used.
2 people who did the ancilliary stuff like testing, documentation and so on. Great surgeons have a team, same is true with great engineers.
I think the problem may be with the pure architect model. No engineer likes being told here is a perfect architecture, just code it as per that spec.  Going back to the house analogy, we need more architectural engineers who create designs that they know will work and they prove that they work by writing the code.",1304425135

Let me tell you why, because __some__ users of Emacs think that by learning to use some bloated piece of junk software will make them special, that by learning to use Emacs they somehow demonstrate their intellectual superiority among their mates. So you're inferring that people who don't like Emacs or prefer other editors are somehow intellectually inferior to those who learn it and use it.
Well, that is not the case. In fact, if you can achieve exactly the same thing with a simpler, easier to use tool and you're still using the bloated one, it's you who is mentally retarded, not those who use the other tool.
So just to conclude, just spare me and others of this bullshit.
And also please note that I know what usability is, and when I wrote my previous comment I was thinking about very precise Emacs issues which I don't have time and I also don't want to discuss.

Well, then how can it be useful if it is wrong more than it is right....?<p>Simply stated, being right more than one is wrong is the same thing as being more accurate than a random assignment (as we approach a large number of ""trials"") if the outcomes are equally likely. And that is the point - race tells you nothing more significant about class then guessing does (if we remove 'middle class' as a selection), and class tells you nothing significant about behavior.<p>Also, you seem to be conflating 'class' and 'culture' now. Culture is a much, much better indicator of behavior than class, as culture speaks to beliefs and value judgements. As such, they are not interchangable ideas (that is, the propostion that 'Skin color is a good predictor of culture' is not the same as the one you made prior,  'Skin color is a good predictor of class' - but is probably just as fallacious).<p>Clothing and hair (God only knows what you meant by 'accent.' Care to clarify?) in isolation are strong enough indicators of culture, that race quite literally adds nothing to their accuracy - the same can be said of 'style of dress' and 'price of car driven,' for class.

You are more likely to interact with someone who is on the same train than someone who isn't. If you prefer to interact with people of the same race, you would be better off if your train had been restricted to only people of your race. Similar logic applies to a full bar or any workplace. If you prefer to date people of a certain race, you also prefer to interact with people of that race compared to others of your desired gender since less intimate interactions are a prerequisite for dating.<p><i>""It would be nice if everyone was so enlightened as to not care about race, but there is 10,000+ years of evolutionary pressure pushing things the other direction.""</i><p>No such pressure exists.

It <i>does</i> hurt people. Mating is a market just like everything else in life, and if you reduce demand for someone's product due to something as arbitrary as melanin level, then you're reducing their equilibrium price and requiring them to make more compromises when it comes to choosing a mate.<p>No one expects you to sleep with someone just to give them a helping hand, but that shouldn't be expected with jobs either.",1267839316

The odds of someone who is neither white nor ethnically Jewish carrying the gene are substantially lower than the odds of a white man carrying it.

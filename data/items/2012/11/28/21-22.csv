Natively, these functions stop javascript execution to wait for the users input, so that it knows what to do, but do not allow for customization. Non-native libraries do not have this ability to prompt the user for input, then wait for their response, before continuing the execution of that script. Callbacks are one way to circumvent this issue, but introduce new issues with scope and readability.<p>All I'm trying to say is that allowing custom defined objects to have the ability to block execution can be very handy in certain instances. I by no means was criticizing the alertify.js library",1354139994

Most people go to business school to switch to a new type of business job.  About 40% come from engineering because they realize they hate it and want to do something making more money with less hours.<p>If you had a great job, lets say Investment Banking, you may go to a top business school to switch to Private Equity.  To an hacker those don't sound different, but they are worlds apart.<p>The biggest benefit to getting an MBA is that it gives you an excuse to interview with whatever company you want to.  It gives you the opportunity to really change your path.  Few other places do that.",1354139986

Additionally rocket engines are more efficient in less dense atmosphere ""because the thinner air allows a better plume"". They estimate that launching from 30,000 feet provides 9.3% greater thrust.<p>Note that much of the energy spent for orbital flight is not spend getting height, but spent getting speed. Efficiency is greatly increased if you can reach high speeds without having to carry the reaction mass to reach those speeds.<p>LEO requires about 7.8 km/s, Skylon's jet engines can go around 1.7 km/s. You are reaching 20% of your orbital velocity without reaction mass.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine)#Advantages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine)#Advantage...</a><p>The big savings, like spacex's grasshopper project, is of course a reusable space vehicle. The advantage to spacex's approach is that Skylon is a single stage to orbit space plane (you don't need to land a bunch of stages using retro-rockets).<p>If I was placing a bet, I would bet on spacex since they have a proven track record (rockets are easy, organizing/funding rocket companies is hard).  Skylon is a great idea though and it is the general direction that aircraft engine design is headed (a peak at the future).",1354139796

We get disastrous manage-by-the-numbers and ""us vs. them"" mentality, ultimately devaluing the role of the manager! If all you need to manage is a report that says how many widgets employee X made relative to compensation you can automate away most management.<p>Yes, under that definition (not all MBA programs are like that, but it seems the majority are), I think the MBA is bad for the US economy. It promotes underperformance, lack of innovation, and sucks up resources that could better be spent elsewhere.<p>Instead, they should teach Drucker-ism (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker</a>) and Organizational Systems Theory (<a href=""http://managementhelp.org/organizations/systems.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://managementhelp.org/organizations/systems.htm</a>).<p>Managers can and do amazing things by enabling their coworkers to scale better by:<p>* Removing roadblocks that get in their way<p>* Listen to, and allow employees to change and shape the culture<p>* Coach coworkers to improve skills and develop flow<p>* Help mentor and guide the organization as it scales up<p>Though, we need far fewer of them if we leave it to stuff like this. It allows organizations to be a lot flatter and scale better without dedicated managers, putting causing downward demand on managers so it seems something most MBA programs won't adopt. Still, it would prevent wholesale manager-bankruptcy that I envision is the future for the ""managing"" class in most businesses.",1354139742

That's because the PostgreSQL/Unicorn/Redis/whatever that's on Heroku is the same as what I can run on any of those other services.  Even if I use Microsoft's technologies, it's generally not that hard to move form a pure Windows stack to a Mono/PostgreSQL one these days.<p>That's not true for App Engine.

4844910,comment,4844786,4844786,11,0,jfaucett,,,"interesting article. This assertion does go against the last 200 years or so (since the Grimm Brothers) of thought about the origins of the English language.  I'm not an expert but I did major in linguistics and have studied the history of the english language in some depth.<p>For me, the strongest points this new proposal has are the syntactical features that scandinavian and modern english share. Syntactical features i.e. sentence structure being adopted from one language to another is very very rare and when it does occur it happens at a much slower rate. There are a couple week points in the theory though. #1 and the article admits this, Old English is West Germanic. #2 Chaucer's english is vastly different from Old English but I don't think anyone would say its a completely new Language, there are too many similarities, shared vocabularies, etc, this has until now led everyone to believe modern english discends from old english and was mingled up with scandinavian and then norman french.<p>Also, almost all the syntactical similarities the article shows have to do with the split verb that modern english doesn't have. In german ""ich habe gestern lange gearbeitet"" is in English literally : ""I have yesterday long worked"" but translated should be ""I worked a long time yesterday"" . I think they'd need to give support that the split verb didn't die out, (which is kind of suggested in the texts of chaucer and his predecessors), but rather was something that never existed b/c the ""original"" language, in this case scandinavian, never had them in the first place.",1354138698

4844846,comment,4842617,4842617,10,0,rbranson,,,"While this is certainly useful, it's pretty basic. Something that I find is a much closer fit to UNIX pipes is iterators. UNIX pipes work similarly in that all of the commands in the pipeline are executed in ""parallel"" and the OS passes data incrementally between each process.<p>I primarily work on a Python codebase, and I've found that using iterators for complex, fault-tolerant data pipelines allows decoupled design without many of the performance & additional complexity drawbacks often encountered with cleanly abstracted, decoupled code. For example, when executing a multi-get for objects by primary key, the pipeline looks roughly like this:<p>1. Fetch from heap cache<p>2. Fetch from remote cache<p>3. Fetch from backing store<p>4. Backfill the heap cache<p>5. Backfill the remote cache<p>6. Apply basic filters (e.g. deleted == False, etc)<p>At each step there are usually two or three layers of abstraction underneath. Much of the space requirements, and some of the overhead time at each step can be collapsed to O(1) instead of O(N).<p>For example, a cache multiget abstraction on-top of memcache might look something like this:<p><pre><code>    def deserialize_user(serialized_user):\n        return json.loads(serialized_user)\n\n    def build_prefixed_memcache_key(prefix, key):\n        return ""%s:%s"" % (prefix, key)\n\n    def get_users_from_remote_cache(user_keys):\n        cached_users = get_from_memcache(user_keys, ""user"")\n        deserialized_users = {deserialize_user(value) for key, value in cached_users.iteritems()}\n        return deserialized_users\n\n    def get_from_memcache(keys, prefix):\n        rekeyed = {build_prefixed_memcache_key(prefix, key): key for key in keys}\n        from_memcache = []\n        for chunk in chunks(rekeyed.keys(), 20):\n            results = memcache_mget(chunk)\n            from_memcache.extend(results)\n        unkeyed = {rekeyed[key]: value for key, value in from_memcache}\n        return unkeyed\n</code></pre>\nNotice how at each step there is a large amount of ""buffering"" that causes allocation, copying, and quite a bit of additional work. Each layer of abstraction adds a pretty large cost to the step. Using an iterator implementation, we can clean up this code and make it more performant:<p><pre><code>    def get_users_from_remote_cache(user_keys):\n        for key, user in get_from_memcache(user_keys, ""user""):\n            yield deserialize_user(user)\n\n    def get_from_memcache(keys, prefix):\n        for chunk in ichunks(keys, 20):\n            rekeyed = {build_prefixed_memcache_key(prefix, key): key for key in chunk}\n            for key, value in memcache_mget(rekeyed.keys()):\n                yield (rekeyed[key], value)\n</code></pre>\nIt's clear how much cleaner this code is. Notice how this snippet avoids the large amount of ""buffering"" of data between steps and short-circuits quite a bit of code when possible (for instance, if all of the fetches miss). In real code that's heavily abstracted & layered, avoiding all of this work translates into significant performance & cost advantages.<p>Iterators also allow building portions of the pipeline with built-in functions that avoid the interpeter.<p><pre><code>    def deserialize_users(users):\n        return imap(pickle.loads, users)\n\n    def get_users_from_remote_cache(user_keys):\n        cached_users = get_from_memcache(user_keys, ""user"")\n        only_values = imap(itemgetter(1), cached_users)\n        return deserialize_users(only_values)\n</code></pre>\nThis block of code executes in only one pass through the interpreter (imap, itemgetter, and pickle.loads are all implemented as native functions). This is incredibly powerful because it means that iterator-based abstractions can be built by combining these native building blocks without the overhead of recursion within the interpreter at each step.<p>Pushing all the recursion into native code:<p><pre><code>    def gprefix(prefix, delimiter):\n        prefix_with_delim = prefix + delimiter\n        prefixfn = partial(add, prefix_with_delim)\n        unprefixfn = itemgetter(slice(len(prefix_with_delim), None))\n        return prefixfn, unprefixfn\n\n    def memcache_mget_chunked(keys):\n        chunks = ichunks(keys, 20)\n        result_blocks = imap(memcache_mget, chunks)\n        flattened_results = chain.from_iterable(result_blocks)\n        return flattened_results\n\n    def get_values_from_memcache(keys, prefix):\n        prefixfn = partial(add, ""%s:"" % prefix)\n        prefixed_keys = imap(prefixfn, keys)\n        key_pairs_from_cache = memcache_mget_chunked(prefixed_keys)\n        values_from_cache = imap(itemgetter(1), key_pairs_from_cache)\n        return values_from_cache\n</code></pre>\n* I apologize for any code errors, this code wasn't tested in it's entirety.",1354137908

I had a part time job as a systems programmer/admin at CITHEP (Caltech High Energy Physics), mostly dealing with their VAX-11/780, at the time that Wolfram was using that machine to develop the predecessor or Mathematica.<p>Wolfram and Chris Cole started developing a symbolic math system, which they named Symbolic Manipulation Program (SMP), when they found that Macsyma was unable to handle the computational needs for their physics research. For problems that they considered to be medium problems, Macsyma could do the work, but it was very slow. For problems that they considered to be large problems, Macsyma ran out of memory. Thus, they needed something more efficient in both time and space.<p>Wolfram and Cole planned on writing in C. They asked researchers in the symbolic computation community about this, and were told that it was a terrible idea. C was too low level. To do a high level system like a symbolic algebra system, you had to work at a much higher level. Using anything less than Lisp pretty much guaranteed your project would take forever.<p>Wolfram and Cole decided on C anyway. (BTW, C at CITHEP was not quite standard C. Norman Wilson had hacked the compiler to handle float and double expressions the same way FORTRAN handled them, making C almost as good as FORTRAN for numerical work, and C had mostly taken over from FORTRAN for physics computation there).<p>I recall seeing the factor of 100 number, or something like that, in one of the first public presentations of SMP. On the research problems that Wolfram and Cole considered to be medium sized, SMP was beating the Lisp-based systems by around a factor of 100.",1354137676

Indeed this <i>was</i> the case on the African savannah, pre-agriculture.<p>We're no longer living in that environment. In the 21st century it's trivial to get sufficient calories, vitamins, and a balanced diet without eating meat.<p>Other points about our environment: (1) Relative to the African savannah, most of us burn many fewer calories per day. Fat asses in front of a computer instead of chasing down antelope, yanno.  (2) We live 3x as long now, so our health concerns are different. That high-calorie blob of fat is tasty because it meant not freezing to death at age 16 and hence those taste buds were strongly selected for. Today we don't have that concern, and all those fat blobs may mean living to 60 instead of 80.<p>The survival needs of proto-humans on the savannah 100kya are  not a very good guide to nutrition and health in the 21st century.",1354137596

The spec should be updated to require UTF-16 support in all implementations.<p>If a modern programming language like JavaScript doesn't provide a way to represent characters outside the BMP in its character data type, that needs to be fixed too.

Some insight on why we chose Authy (more on this in a blog post to follow)...<p>1. Authy app will support google authenticator tokens within the next 2 weeks.<p>2. We chose Authy to solve many of the problems with Google Authenticator. Once you start using Authy you'll notice everything works seamlessly. Google Authenticator on the other hand has a few problems:<p>- If you lose your phone, there is no way to revoke access to your token.<p>- Google Authenticator depends on the time of the phone to be right for it to work correctly (same as Authy). But Authy will automatically sync this time for you in the background so you never have to worry, your tokens will always work.\n- If you change your phone, Google Authenticator requires you to go and reconfigure all of your accounts. With Authy all your accounts are synced, so when you upgrade and re-install Authy everything will be setup the way you expect it.<p>- Authy uses 256 bit keys, while Google uses 128 bit keys.<p>- Last year RSA was compromised and all their clients had to manually reset their keys. Google Authenticator has the same issue, if the keys were ever compromised everyone would have to manually reset the keys.

Notably, Amazon won't actually stick their neck out and certify AWS as HIPAA compliant through a business associates agreement (interestingly Microsoft will for Azure: <a href=""http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/support/trust-center/compliance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/support/trust-center/compl...</a>). I've been told by consultants that Amazon has so much business it's just not worth their time to bother with the headache of setting up such agreements.",1354136794

Also affected: prior investment in rigs given expected-payback and risk levels.<p>But the decision ""with my current fixed plant, do I mine this hour, or not?"" is unaffected by anticipation. Either the expected-reward is enough to pay incremental costs, or not.<p>The expected reward for the same hashing power is now half what it was. Surely, <i>some</i> marginal miners who were only slightly profitable before are now non-profitable. It may take them a while to notice, but when they do, they're likely to drop out. But this is far from half of the mining capacity, and other rigs that are still profitable at the new reward rate are still coming online.<p>I expect difficulty to trend down a bit in the very short term... but not by half, and not for long as lower-power rigs continue to come online.",1354136792

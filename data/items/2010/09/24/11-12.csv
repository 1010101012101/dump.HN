A lot of the points pornel mention apply equally to GUI toolkits running on Windows or Linux.

He probably just banged out the email without doing a spell-check. Let's remember it was a private email. Had he intended to have it published he probably would have taken more care. I can't speak for Ron, of course, but I will say that I frequently write the word ""entrepreneur"" (i.e. in blog posts, emails, etc). I'm not sure why - maybe it's the way I touch-type - but I often miss the second 'r'. I typically don't even notice until I do a spell-check.

1723326,comment,1723140,1723140,0,0,DirtyAndy,,,"It concerns me where you say: We've been struggling with selling our product because many people refuse to change and don't want to learn new technologies.<p>If you are getting this product in front of true potential clients and they are not saying ""wow we need this"" then you might be in trouble. Even traditional industries now realise the value of technology and if it is going to save/make them money they wont be against new technologies (and for the few exceptions, stay away from them - they'll soon be dead).<p>So firstly you need to make sure you are building something that customers ""don't know they want/need"" as opposed to building something ""they don't need or want"". Just because you thought it was a great idea and could save money or improve processes doesn't mean they will. So if this is not a spinoff of software you have already done for a company I would suggest you do some serious market research to ensure you are not flogging a dead horse.<p>The next stage is then marketing. Firstly in doing your market research you should have identified some potential clients that said ""yes this would be useful"", so target them first. Then target their competitors. If this is a product that costs a lot of money then you can factor in having a sales team that really spends time selling the product to each client.<p>Then think about how you can market the product. It doesn't sound like your target users are likely to be doing Google searches for this product, they may not read anything online in relation to their industry, but are their industry magazines? Can you get cheap advertising in such magazines. Can you offer to write an article about how ""tech is changing the industry"" - you don't need to reference your product too much if at all - ""Guest article by Yosho, CEO of XYZ Enterprises"" will get things started.<p>And lastly don't forget about face to face with any local businesses that you might be able to work with. I did some work with a small consulting company that was looking for new clients, they decided to go to some conferences to try and get new clients. I found a website in the US that showed approximate turnovers for businesses in the area (can't remember the site but was government related) and we found more than 2,000 business with 10 mill a year turnover (their target clients) within about a 10 mile radius of their office. Here they were all about to get on planes to get clients that would have them on planes and away from family for years, and they had never tapped the 2,000 clients down the road. Anyone close to you involved in the industry you are targetting - cold call them, phone them and ask to meet them and show them what you are doing. If you are young (under 25 say) play the ""I need guidance"" card - you'll be amazed at how many people might be interested in helping. And never rule out getting these people involved - potential investors etc.<p>Good luck, but do check that you are building something someone wants before you go too far!",1285327367

They generally do a rather good job of avoiding that worst case, by careful choice of pivots[1]. McIlroy has a very simple technique for making that choice produce bad results in almost all quicksort implementations.<p>Unfortunately, he has to cheat a bit. His code doesn't construct an array full of evil values. Rather, he has an adaptive comparison function that, in effect, constructs the array of evil <i>during the sorting process</i>. (But it always behaves consistently; the elements of the array are, so to speak, undecided until the sorting routine looks at them, but they don't change after they've been looked at.)<p>[1] For those who don't know, here's the quicksort algorithm: Choose one element of your array (the ""pivot""); partition the array into things smaller than the pivot and things larger than the pivot; then, recursively, sort the two parts you just made. This works well, at least when you aren't facing McIlroy's evil adversary, because (1) you can do the partitioning operation very efficiently and (2) if you're not very unlucky with your choice of pivot you usually succeed in dividing the array into two parts of roughly equal size. But if the pivot is, say, always the smallest element of your array, you'll get terrible results.",1285327099

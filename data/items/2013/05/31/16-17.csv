A lot of the deep nastiness of C++ is related to C compatibility; but C++ without C (++?) wouldn't have had even the awful tool support that it did; it would never, ever have taken off to the same degree. I'm not a C++ jock -- when I was getting started (1992), the pain/pleasure threshold was very different than it is today.",1370019597

However you're only storing about 20% of the energy at 2.7V.<p>Edit: I'll show my work.<p>Farads are Joules (energy) per Volt (electric potential) squared. That means that the formula for energy stored (E) in a capacitor is E=CV^2.<p>A 1200F cap charged to 2.7V stores 8478 Joules of energy. A 1200F cap charged to 6V stores 43,200 Joules of energy. That means that at a charge of 2.7V there's ~80% less energy stored in the capacitor than at 6V. Incidentally this ratio holds no matter value of the capacitor.",1370019513

She created a novel dielectric and achieved an energy density of 20.1 Wh/kg which is about half of that of a lead-acid battery, and something like 6%-10% of a Lithium Polymer battery. She lists a capacitance per volume, but nothing about breakdown voltages, so I can't say what the size of her capacitor would theoretically be for 1200F rated at 6V. Nor can I say if it'd even be feasible without knowing how difficult/expensive the dielectric is to manufacture.<p>Also, here's a page [2] with a list of common battery chemistries and ballpark figures for their energy density values (about halfway down in green).

It's admirable that an old hand like Joe Armstrong can be so open and accepting of something that essentially sets out to improve on his lifework.<p>In fact, if you look at his paper on the development of Erlang [1]while at Ericsson, which is coincidentally a juicy, fascinating read, Armstrong is being very forthcoming about the struggle to develop the language, in particular developing a good syntax, and also very forthcoming about the involved parties' lack of experience with language design; in particular, the Prolog-like syntax seems less of a planned decision than a side-effect of the first implementations being written in Prolog itself, and following the path of least resistance. Also, it worked.<p>At any rate; it seems clear to me that Armstrong values the principles behind Erlang's <i>design</i> (concurrency, immutability, fault tolerance and so on) more than the actual syntax. I wonder, at this point, how amenable he would be to larger syntax changes to Erlang itself, or if he is happy with the fact that Elixir is a completely separate project.<p>(There is something weird about the effusive tone and surreal humour in the blog post, though. Is this his new ""Erlang evangelist voice"", or has he always been writing in this way?)<p>[1]<a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwebcem01.cem.itesm.mx%3A8005%2Ferlang%2Fcd%2Fdownloads%2Fhopl_erlang.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwebcem01.cem...</a>",1370018770

Getting a merchant account and setting up a foreign currency account has been notoriously difficult to get in the past with extremely high fees and approval requirements. This is no longer the case. Braintree sponsors merchants to get setup with a merchant account in Australia and has built an accelerated process to creating foreign currency accounts.<p>If a provider states that no merchant account is required, you are most likely being placed on an aggregated merchant account. This has many disadvantages for the merchant as you are grouped under one umbrella account. As the provider grows, this becomes unsustainable and often leads to poor customer experiences (a la Paypal account freezes).<p>We're working to create a sustainable solution where customer service and great software are the central focus.

To further demonstrate:<p>As a hypothetical example, let's say there are two parties in which it would be equally responsible to disclose a vulnerability to (perhaps they jointly developed the product or service) and as a condition of payment both separately require that the vulnerability not be disclosed elsewhere, theoretically including the other party (hopefully that wouldn't be the case in reality, but again, this is hypothetical). Now let's say party one offers $4,500 and party two offers $20,000. The choice of either party is ethical on the grounds that both have been defined as equally responsible recipients of the disclosure.

And this is a common sense category (e.g. very few people would say that police should have to go get a warrant to search a robber caught at the crime scene for weapons).<p>Contemporary battles tend to be over what kinds of searches require warrants.<p>This isn't just a battle over grammar, however. It's a question of: ""what did we agree on the scope of the government's powers being?"" As a general rule, the law doesn't constraint the government's ability to subpoena information from a third party without a warrant. E.g. if you're being prosecuted for fraud, the government doesn't need a warrant to subpoena your business partners requesting all documents they have from their dealings with you. The purpose of the 4th amendment is to protect you from the indignity of the search, not to protect the information itself. Under that logic, you can make a reasonable case that nothing should stop the government from subpoenaing any information Google or AT&T have about you.<p>The real problem here is the secret nature of the NSL's, not the 4th amendment issues, IMHO. One of the things that justifies the far-reaching subpoena powers of common law courts is the fact that they are distributed, transparent entities--nearly everything is a matter of public record.<p>[1] In plain speech, I might say: ""I eat pizza, and I eat cake."" The "", and"" combines two independent thoughts without any necessary relationship between them, other than the fact that I like both. It could be the case that I never eat pizza and cake in the same meal.",1370017751

I've heard people try to compare tiny elements from the two shows, saying ""look at what a rip-off this is"" (as if the Trek writers took JMS's five-season script and cribbed from it liberally), but it strikes me as more like the Trek writers took a little inspiration from JMS's pitch and then went an entirely different direction with it.<p>I mean, they are both space stations with numbers in their names.  The remaining similarities are equally superficial.  They're not really trying to tell the same type of story -- B5 is about massive-scale diplomacy (with war as an extension of diplomacy, like Clausewitz said) and empire-building.  DS9 is mostly standard Star Trek style one-off episodes: aliens who feed on creativity, time travel to Roswell, Bajoran politicians abusing power in trying to recover stolen farm equipment.  Even the ""big"" storyline of the Dominion War is a much smaller scale than B5's Shadow War.  Sure, they both had huge battles, but I'm inclined to blame that on advances in CG -- ST:TNG certainly referenced huge battles, like during the Klingon Civil War, but never put them on screen.<p>Thus, I contend that DS9 has way more in common with the rest of the Treks than it does with B5, and liking one won't translate into liking the other.",1370017463

5799488,comment,5798972,5799071,25,0,tmhedberg,,,"Scheme (and FP in general) is much more than just first-class functions. If that's all that is required for a language to be considered functional, then nearly every modern programming language is a functional language, and the term becomes essentially meaningless. First-class functions are nothing special or unique anymore.<p>FP is also about frictionless <i>composition</i> of functions, declarative rather than imperative style, use of expressions instead of statements, and very critically, emphasis on statelessness and immutable data.<p>JavaScript is anything but stateless--it is extremely awkward, if not impossible, to avoid mutation in idiomatic JS code. Imperative statements abound, and everything is a reference, there are really no pure values to be found. Functions can be composed, but the syntax makes it unintuitive and ugly. And though it is probably not a hard requirement for FP, most FP languages at least make an attempt to distinguish pure functions from stateful procedures, e.g. via types in Haskell, or just naming conventions, as with Scheme's `set!`, but JS does not really facilitate this in any way.<p>Functions and lexical closures are undoubtedly some of ""the Good Parts"" of JavaScript, but these alone are not sufficient for functional programming. JS is fundamentally an imperative, OO language which happens to have a very light dusting of FP flavor on top.",1370017070

I read somewhere that the Wernicke's area is divided into two if you do this as well. Perhaps auditory memories are triggered based on language as well. You think and have internal dialogues in different languages which triggers completely different memories. This explains why one might lose one language, but keep the other one.<p>Whereas, for learning languages later in life, a person tends to translate the new language into the main language. The internal dialogue is always in the form of the main language. The memories are one contiguous experience based on one language. Often, when self examining during meditations, it is hard to make out what language is used. This explains why a brain problem will wipe out sections of speaking ability across all languages because they are all eventually translated from the main language.<p>Like people who started with C, we tend to think in C and see how new languages add on to C and just remembers the new rules of the new language relative to C instead of having a completely new life experience from ground up of learning the new programming language.<p>In short: Bane said: ""I was born in darkness, you simply adapted""",1370016325

I have nothing against nootropic stacking, but feeling like you <i>have</i> to take something just to keep up with the baseline is a sign of a deeply dysfunctional workaholic culture.<p>Many other large overhyped cities are not much better.

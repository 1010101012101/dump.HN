It will take a government-pioneered oddity that was out of reach of the masses and explore millions of ways to make it of financial benefit to the entrepreneurs who can get there first.  Like with the Internet, society will be pulled along in the vortex of the Race to Space.  Space will become accessible for a price and in ways that would have been inconceivable a decade before.<p>The technical challenges with space travel are much greater and so the time before we reach the exponential part of the curve is further away, but when the critical mass of Space travel technology has been reached it will be like the Internet in the 1990's.  The Internet had been around for 20 years and only governmental and academic types even knew anything about it.  Within a few years of its commercialization, its use and uses had exploded.  We went from the average joe not knowing anything about it to seeing an abundance of commercials on television for it within just a couple of years.<p>I mention the Internet, but the pattern is one that you can see in the adoption of transatlantic sailing, rail travel, electricity, automobiles, etc.  Space travel will be no different.",1337961594

As a matter of fact I absolutely don't ""hate"" DuckDuckGo --actually I seriously considered switching at some point, out of privacy concerns, and eventually decided against it, for 3 reasons, the main of which being the UI and graphic identity. Besides, I feel a lot of sympathy for people like you --I know what it is to be a startup taking on an established behemoth.<p>But that's the thing with criticism done over the Internet: readers will tend to lend the worse intentions to the poster, an effect that is multiplied when the reader is also the target. Had I written this criticism in an email to you instead of a HN thread, I would have sugar-coated it in order to be listened. There is no better way to have your opinion ignored than to make it sound as an attack on your audience's identity.<p>Still: do consider a rebranding of your product. The best niche to start from if your are a search engine is probably the niche of top hackers, rather than middle-aged women. Mainstream markets are conquered by starting with the knowledgeable power users for the kind of product you're building (PG has said that quite a few times I believe). If your name & graphic identity are disliked by a significant proportions of people on HN, it's a sign something is wrong.<p>Thanks for listening.",1337961501

On the surface, MongoDB did solve our data problem, and we thought we sufficiently researched the technology that it would work, even attending multiple MongoDB conferences and talking to 10gen employees.<p>The issue was that underlying architectural decisions in MongoDB ended up biting us and limiting us rather significantly. It could be argued that this is because MongoDB is a rather new piece of tech (I disagree, I think MongoDB is fundamentally flawed, but it doesn't matter in this argument).<p>Because of our experience, going with the standby IS the best choice, until you _need_ something else. Riak was a change necessitated by its fast growth such that horizontally scaling was necessary when you're in an environment such as EC2.

I accept that my mind includes within it a mechanism for habit automation.  Of course that is only one of many tools in the metacognitive toolbox.  Another powerful tool is the ability to be brutally honest with yourself about what your priorities are in practice, what you think they should be, and recognizing when your actions are working against the priorities you would like to have.

4023904,comment,4023265,4023265,10,0,kamaal,,,"Unix is basically a REPL for the C programming language. Its more than a operating system, its actually a development environment. And most of the Unix utilities that you see today are sum total of people trying to solve problems they faced repeateadly. There fore what you see is tiny utilities with a lot options each designed to solve both a operating system and a programming problem. That is precisely what helps people to write almost real looking programs by just sewing commands using the pipe.<p>I love the all the three points the author mentions, because together they form a a very powerful platform to work with and solve problems.<p>>>Why does ls have dozens of tangled options? Because users, even Unix users, are not overly fond of the first two points of the Unix philosophy. They dont want to chain little programs together. Theyd rather do more with the tool at hand than put it down to pick up new tools. They do appreciate the ideal of single-purpose tools that work well together, but not too strictly.<p>I don't agree with this. I can tell you that I just love Unix the way it is now. People feel they are messy because,as I said they always keep looking at them as <i>commands</i> and not as small programs that can be used together to solve problems. Most people don't realize this, because they don't know how to use it. It takes a lot of time to mature on the Unix platform. You have to learn what the commands do, then you need to go out and learn how to use them in combinations. Then you need to start learning the Unix way of representing data and transforming data to solve problems.<p>Like always most people don't realize the fact that data is a actually 'Text'. And not learning how to work with Text/Strings/Data generally creates all sorts of other problems. Although projects which are RDBMS heavy don't encounter them usually. But a lot of projects that are not DB heavy really pass through frustrating patches of time trying to figure out easy ways of representing, transforming and working with Data(Text). The most common format which is heavily abused are XML's. Followed by JSON these days. But in my experience if only they had learned how to use a little grep, cat, head, tail, sed, awk and learned to represent their data properly they would save themselves writing several hundreds to thousand lines of code. This problem is especially prevalent in the Java world. They are plagued with writing endless programs that actually do a subset of what sed or awk do. Its sad, but most people express shock and surprise while shown how their 500 line Java program is actually a one line sed command. Or how a simple awk command actually does what they spent a whole day writing. Not understanding Unix forces you just re implement Unix utilities badly!<p>Unix utilities were precisely invented to solve these kind of problems. In fact if you find yourself solving a problem a particular way, then ideally you should use a tool that can be programmed that particular way to solve the problem.<p>A tool like sed is implicitly designed to open files, iterate line by line, provide you with matching, manipulating, counting, printing abilities. It also contains variables to hold data, and do all other kinds of manipulations. If you were to keep writing programs in permutations of logic to perform each of these facilities specifically as needed(Which is pretty common, if your data is in files), you might as well just go ahead and learn sed. Because that will ensure you not just save on writing code, but will also save you time.<p>Now this is just sed, Awk can go further. It can help you do a lot more stuff. It gives you conditionals, more sharpened regexes, better ways of handling field separated data, variables, functions and much more. Combined with stuff like wc, less, cat, tr, xargs, grep, column etc you really get a full fledged programming language(Without even realizing that you have one :)) in which you can hack real fast without worrying about bugs.<p>The thing is 'Text' is actually data. And knowing how to play with Text and learning how to manipulate it well helps you solve problems elegantly, quickly and in a far more easier way than writing a specific program for each task.<p>As a final leap, you mature as a Unix programmer when you learn Perl. Its the King of scripting languages. You master Perl, you begin to truly appreciate the beauty of what it means to be a backend Unix programmer. Its a world whose beauty and power is known to those who program in it. It completes the total Unix equation and suddenly you recieve your enlightenement and realize why despite Unix's messiness it still is the best thing in the world.<p>Worse is Indeed, Better!",1337960054

Consistent coding convention :)<p>As a constructive note, think about reversing your conditions (check if something NOT happened) and break huge chunks of code into functions. This will guarantee a 'sane' amount of nested 'ifs' and improve code readability.
Ex:<p><pre><code>  for (int i = dn - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (!has_child(dlist[i]->d_name)) {

      } else {
        slog(LOG_ERR, ""Can't read %s: %m"", path);
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>

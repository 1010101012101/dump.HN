6506453,comment,6504451,6504451,1,0,danbmil99,,,"Good post. I think many of us focus on the product and modifying it first (before questioning sales / marketing tactics) because we are developers, we know how to code, and in fact we actually enjoy tinkering with our product; it gives us a sense that we&#x27;re doing something consequential that could change the dynamics of the situation.<p>The unfortunate truth is that early in a product&#x27;s lifecycle, I suspect the quality (as programmers measure it) of the product, the beauty (or lack thereof) of the codebase, and even outright bugs, misfeatures, and poor performance, are not the reasons the product does or does not get traction.  As OP says, what gets traction is product/customer fit -- the NEED a potential customer feels for the product.  And if the wrong customer is pitched, and the right customer does not know about your product, all the tinkering and new features and bugfixes and refactoring in the world will not change that situation.<p>TL; DR: Programmers have code hammers, so they just bang the product nail again and again.",1381118193

I worked on a helpdesk part-time in University and had to support OS8 and OS9.  Horrible, horrible operating systems.

I was previously employed as a Cardiac Rehab Nurse as well and it was very frustrating as I did not have creative freedom to manage problems I wanted to solve in that industry. Like jnardiello I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s, no kids, no mortgage, just newly wedded and have a very supportive wife. I basically wanted to solve a specific problem at work and I came across Web Apps. This changed my world and I decided to build one for a specific purpose at work (sixmwt.com,6MWT App). I did this in my spare time and decided only two weeks before my wedding (last month) to quit my Cardiac Rehab job and pursue web apps. I still work as a Cardiac Nurse once a week with the flexibility of picking up extra shifts when I do need to. It&#x27;s scary as hell as I am a clinical person and have no experience with the IT industry. I basically stackoverlow, youtube and google things I need help with. I am very lucky to have a friend who is mentoring me in .Net/C# at the moment, I won&#x27;t bore HN with that (you can read more at neilbo21.wordpress.com). I&#x27;ve been working on my resume and portfolio and I guess that&#x27;s the main thing to work on. Show people what you can do (especially on GitHub). This advice has been recently reinforced from a great Software company (@Net_Engine) who I met with the other day to help guide me through this life changing decision. So I guess if it is any source of inspiration...ask yourself why you want the change, what is it about programming that you love? I guess I&#x27;m still in the honeymoon phase of learning something new, I love the instant gratification of writing a few lines of markup code and solving problems with web programming. I&#x27;d love to delve deeper and make a real CRUD app and use databases etc.<p>I wish you well in whatever you choose to do, Good Luck.",1381117828

Even though they pointed out that they have gone out of their way to no longer take offense at the colloquial use of the word &quot;guys&quot;.<p>... But is, then, offended by the colloquial use of the word guys.<p>... To the point that they accost the visitor over it. Even implying in front of the whole channel that the visitor is sexist and ignorant that women exist on IRC (which can be the only purpose of calling them out on that word).<p>The visitor is likely surprised, shocked, and did not come into the technical channel to discuss a technical question to have a discussion about gender and linguistic issues, so tries to diffuse the situation with some poorly chosen attempt at ironic humor by rhetorically employing a couple common internet memes &quot;proof&quot; and &quot;boobs or gtfo&quot;. You know, the same way a lot of nice normal people might awkwardly respond to being sideswiped out of nowhere by someone with a pet-issue to grind at every opportunity (though that is something I usually ascribe to people trying to turn every conversation into a debate about guns, abortion, immigration, or Obama&#x27;s birth certificate).<p>Nobody has ever been out in public or at a party minding their own business or having a discussion and had someone come out of the blue to attack them loudly in front of everybody about something crazy that didn&#x27;t seem to have any relevance to the moment? I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s how this person felt.<p>Kind of the way I remember having someone come up to me out of nowhere in public to talk about how I needed to find god and was going to hell and, dismissively, I told them I didn&#x27;t have time to listen to them, because I was already late for a group satanic sacrifice. Spoiler -- I wasn&#x27;t actually a satanist and I wasn&#x27;t really on my way to participate in any sort of sacrifice. I was being <i>gasp</i> dismissive toward the person who attacked me like a crazy person, out of nowhere.<p>The author, who used to get upset at &quot;guys&quot;, but no longer gets upset at &quot;guys&quot;, except that they just got upset at &quot;guys&quot; admits that the thing that actually upset them was the way the visitor responded. They &quot;expected&quot; or &quot;wanted&quot; the person to engage in a discussion of gender and linguistics. The author states this in the first half of their livejournal update.<p>In short, the author of this livejournal entry was trolling, knew they were trolling, and while probably unwilling to admit that they were, goes on to detail what can only be described as trolling behavior on their own accord.<p>And, because the visitor chose to sarcastically dismiss it by repeating a couple silly internet memes rather than take the author&#x27;s bait to have a heated gender and linguistics debate in a tech channel, the author appealed to the moderators to have the visitor banned . . . which he then was.<p>The author then poses the question about whatever are we to do about trolls? A hypocritical question, given the circumstances. Nonetheless, it would seem fairly self-evident that what you should do about trolls in a community is appeal to the moderation team of your community to do something about it and if they don&#x27;t, consider finding a community with better moderation.<p>I would suggest that the visitor responded to being accosted rather poorly, but I can certainly understand the intent behind his poor response. He was attacked out of nowhere for something trivial (and not even reaching the levels of trivial to most human beings who simply wouldn&#x27;t give a damn), but probably should have paused for a moment longer and taken a deep breath before responding <i>at all</i>. Perhaps even ignoring the comment entirely and going on with his technical purpose for being in the channel.<p>I would also suggest that the author was clearly engaging in trollish behavior and then lobbied the moderation in a room that this person is already known in to deal with the person that they tried to troll by trying to label <i>them</i> a troll. They got their way, likely due to the bias of familiarity with the author, and got the person banned. Then went on to write an article outlining everything and purporting to be yet another victim of yet another brash example of sexist internet trolls.<p>My advice? If you&#x27;re going to bitch about trolls on the internet, don&#x27;t be one yourself. If something truly and legitimately is offensive and disruptive, seek moderation, which exists in most communities. And, finally, no matter how well-intentioned you are, someone will always find things to be offended by with regard to yourself, so learn to just shrug it off, not respond or engage such people at all lest you become fodder for their crusade, and just carry on with what you were doing before.<p>Addendum:<p>None of this is meant to imply that there are not legitimate assholes out there intending to offend and disrupt, because there certainly are plenty of them.<p>I am also not &quot;excusing&quot; or &quot;justifying&quot; anyone&#x27;s behavior. I know the common response to anything short of &quot;oh, you poor thing -- you had to deal with that hideous troll!&quot; would be treated as excusing mistreatment on the internet. I am simply trying to clarify what happened here, according to the livejournal entry, itself. To suggest that the author played a purely innocent role here and was not itching for a fight and engaging in trollish behavior here and then lashing out (via moderators) at someone would be pretty myopic.",1381117101

The second is highly problematic - but one doesn&#x27;t necessarily lead to the other. Our civil liberties and civil rights have always been subject to appropriate exceptions. The problem is when those exceptions become so broad as to render the freedoms ineffective, not that they exist at all.",1381115084

Whenever I see anyone earnestly giving the advice that you absolutely must do this in order to be happy, I just tend to think that&#x27;s a person who hasn&#x27;t happened to find the job that really lights their fuse.

6506335,comment,6505111,6506038,2,0,rustynails77,,,"I believe Apple do a good job in many ways.  They also show more responsibility than Microsoft did 15 years ago.<p>But...<p>Apple do fail in a number of key ways, and despite your attack on most geeks, I will defend them.<p>1. Compatibility.  Apple really drop the ball here.  As one example, they don&#x27;t support FLAC .. why?  No reason at all, except maybe it threatens ALAC.  For people with FLAC collections, moving to Apple is a pain in the ass.  The same can be said for many other audio and video formats.  Apple&#x27;s support is lousy and is locked in for no good reason.  In fact, it forces you to limit the choices you can make ... again, for no reason.  If anyone wanted to share my content and they were Apple users, I&#x27;d say &quot;sorry, go for an open platform and then we&#x27;ll talk&quot;.<p>2. Apple excel at the basics, but fail with more complex activities.  Some simple examples: iTunes went a little funny at one stage.  It was impossible to get any music onto my iPhone because iTunes wouldn&#x27;t allow it.  I used 3rd party tools - which would put the music on, but as soon as I started iTunes, it corrupted those newly copied songs...  Now, if I were using Android, i&#x27;d just copy the files to my phone - just like i&#x27;d copy files from one folder to another ...  This is an example of something fundamentally basic being made very, very, VERY hard because ... of ... no good reason.  note: since fixed.<p>3. Apple provides minimal settings.  In many ways, this is great, but... at one stage, my iPhone 4s lost the plot with the audio volume for music and videos via the inbuilt speaker.  I could not get the audio volume to work using the &quot;physical&quot; switch, nor by adjusting the volume up or down ... it took me M-O-N-T-H-S to solve this ... others reported the same problem, and Apple said &quot;factory reset&quot; or &quot;return the phone, it&#x27;s a hardware fault&quot;.  It turned out to be two things... (1) a software bug in IOS, and (2) it was caused when you plugged audio devices into the interface port, but switched the external device off while music was playing.  note: since fixed.<p>The reality is that I have been burnt by 1. 2. and 3. - and I would not have had those problems on Android.  I also believe these problems impact geeks and non-geeks alike.<p>The good news, problems 2. and 3. have been solved.  Apple introduced a &quot;reset all settings&quot; option which takes care of &quot;magic settings&quot; ... it fixed my broken keyboard when I updated to IOS7 (as an example).<p>In my view, blame the geek doesn&#x27;t cut it.",1381114817

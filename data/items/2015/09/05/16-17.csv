He got a six month break from school, passed the GED with perfect scores in three sections, scored high on his ACTs & immediately applied to the local university where he was accepted and carried a 3.8 GPA.  For me this was a wake up call.  I&#x27;d never taken school as seriously as my parents, my mom being a school teacher, but I did buy into this myth that high-school graduation was a necessary evil.

I&#x27;d be fine with that being a plain html site with nothing but a few paragraphs and some bullet point lists. Maybe a table or two as well, and a link to somewhere I can give you money.<p>Now the last thing I need is for that part of the page to zoom in, wiggle around or do any other bogheaded things a designer with just enough jQuery to be dangerous could think of whilst they&#x27;re being &quot;creative&quot; with it.<p>Now from a marketing perspective, this is incredibly stupid. A sales page is a machine for turning prospects into customers. There&#x27;s a single design purpose if there is one. If someone come over and tried to paint flowers on the tip of my soldering iron, I would cut them. If someone decided to replace my PSU with a music box because the music box looks a lot better, I would not be pleased.<p>So why did it ever become a thing to  do that to one of the most essential parts of your business? The part you point your advertising money at. The part that can very well be the difference between you going the way of the ipod or the way of the zune.  Go nuts on your About page if you really have to keep your designer busy, have your faces zoom into it and spin and put the text into maquee tags and what have. But please, for the love of god, don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t ever do that to your sales page, because you&#x27;re wasting my time and your money on that.<p>I blame marketing professionals with an IQ of 50 and designers with delusions of grandeur, CSS3 on the holster, jQuery in their hands, trigger happy on anything customer facing, spreading more $ signs through the site than the rap business.<p></rant>",1441470832

The linear units allow the network to potentially count (one can easily\nadd and subtract constants) and store a finite amount of information for a long period of time. These\nmechanisms are also used in the Gated Recurrent Unit network [7, 9]. In our work we investigate\nthe use of a similar mechanism in a context where the memory is unbounded and structured. As\nopposed to previous work, we do not need to “erase” our memory to store a new unit.<p>Edit: They also provide a table in the paper showing improvements over LSTM for certain types of algorithms.",1441470054

10175168,comment,10172456,10172456,0,0,kohanz,,,"Wow. After only reading the first few paragraphs of the article, my mind was already racing back to my youth experience as a competitive chess player. It really struck a chord with me. Obviously my accomplishments were not even close to the magnitude of Fish, but I can relate intensely to the performance anxiety and urge to <i>quit</i> rather than compete. Wanting to choose flight over fight, so badly.<p>When I was a teenager, I became quite a good chess player for my age, culminating in me winning the U20 championship for my province (pop. ~13 million). I was at a level where I could compete well in adult tournaments, but I dreaded the youth tournaments simply because the expectation was generally that I would finish 1st and not lose (or even draw) a game. Anything less was a disappointment. This pressure did not come from my parents, they were very relaxed and did not push me at all. The expectation just built up over time, each 1st place finish built up more expectations for the next time. I remember getting very close to physically ill before many matches. Not wanting to eat anything. The overwhelming feeling of <i>relief</i> when it was all over.<p>The tournament where I won the provincial championship is one I will never forgot. It was a round-robin between 6 of the top players in the province. I was so nervous. Even though I was one of the lowest-ranked players in the group (I was tops in my region, but not the province), I couldn&#x27;t shake the expectations and nervousness. I lost my first two matches and felt devastated. I didn&#x27;t belong there. I had been a complete imposter up to that point. I had just been lucky. Those were my (ridiculous) thoughts. I had dinner with my dad and cried and cried and told him I wanted to make the 3 hour drive home and just forfeit my remaining matches. My parents never pushed me, but my dad <i>would not let me quit</i>. He talked me off the ledge. Through something that has always felt a bit like fate or divine, I won my remaining through matches and somehow the rest of the competitors managed to the perfect storm of results such that I finished tied for first. Miraculously I won the playoff for the championships.<p>I ended up leaving competitive chess when I was 18 to focus on my engineering studies. That&#x27;s the reason I tell myself and most people, anyway, but to be honest, part of it was being able to <i>quit</i> and leave that competitive world behind. I love competing and playing sports where I know expectations of me are reasonable or none at all, but in a competitive setting where the stakes are high, my body chooses flight over fight every time.<p>I&#x27;m also extremely grateful that this has not extended into my professional life. My mind does not view work, or competing professionally for business, the same as it does competing for trophies.",1441468945

There&#x27;ll be rough spots at first - configuring these devices right now isn&#x27;t great - but hopefully systems like Homekit are going to help with the setup and administration of these devices.",1441468809

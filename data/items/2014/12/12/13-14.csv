If we assume the legacy system actually needs 10 million in enhancements to be adequately protected, I think it&#x27;s safe to say it&#x27;s a train wreck security wise.  For that, and other reasons (Sony assume they will get owned) then it&#x27;s afe to assume the system is going to get compromised.  So its not a risk anymore, it&#x27;s a certainty.<p>So with that said, if the cost is report is 1 million, and the system is vulnerable, and they expect to get compromised then it&#x27;s not just going to cost them just 1 million.  It&#x27;s going to cost them at least 11 million, or more.<p>Further, the &quot;don&#x27;t dix, just accept the risk&quot; costs also won&#x27;t just be 1 million, it&#x27;s going to be 1 million <i>every time</i> it&#x27;s compromised until they fix it.  Since he&#x27;s only accounting for the cost to report the breach, and the box is STILL owned and STILL vulnerable, it&#x27;s going to keep getting compromised.  So its 1 million times each event, which is a potentially infinite since nothing&#x27;s changed to stop the next event.<p>To stop that infinite cycle, he has to pay to fix it, or keep paying to report.  Either way he&#x27;s paying more than 1 million.  And since Sony I&#x27;m sure isn&#x27;t that stupid, let&#x27;s assume someone with common sense will order him to stop accepting the risk and the bleeding, then his real risk cost is 1at lesst 1 million to report and fix once that decision is made (and fixing is probably going to cost more now that the original 10 million since the system is now compromised too).<p>I&#x27;m not sure if he realizes this or not, or if it was a clumsy attempt to explain risk, but at least in the statements reported that&#x27;s a critical flaw in his reasoning.

Alternatives include:<p>- paying for the cable + HBO subscription and only watching GoT.<p>- waiting for the blu ray/dvd/iTunes release<p>Both those options allow you to watch GoT and nothing else. The problem is that people don&#x27;t want to wait for an official release or want a cheaper way to get it &#x27;right now&#x27; (i.e. a cheaper HBO only subscription). I think GoT is a big torrent is because it&#x27;s not available on TV in a lot of countries or there is a big delay between the US airing and the local airing. Another reason is that people don&#x27;t pay for something when they can get it for free. I would like to see how many people who torrent GoT (but say they would pay for it if it was available to them on their terms) would pay $3-5 for an episode via a torrent if there was a button to pay (and get it legally) and a button to get it for free (illegally).",1418391001

It’s an interesting question, right, because there are two things that it can mean. And we’re considering and talking about doing one and not the other. So the one that we don’t want to do: The Like button is really valuable because it’s a way for you to very quickly express a positive emotion or sentiment when someone puts themselves out there and shares something. And, you know, some people have asked for a Dislike button because they want to be able to say ‘That thing isn’t good’. And that’s not something that we think is good for the world. So we’re not going to build that. I don’t think there needs to be a voting mechanism about whether posts are good or bad.

Any network lives and dies on volume and quality of content and Facebook is a great example of a site that (arguably) has both.<p>One of the key driving factors behind this is that anyone can feel comfortable sharing something on Facebook. If you&#x27;re a naturally shy person then there&#x27;s no need to fear downvoting, the worst that can happens is that no one expresses a positive sentiment. You can make everyone aware of something you&#x27;re doing or how you&#x27;re feeling with only the possibility of a positive response.

The second category is something I really need and will be really happy if somebody else created it and because there is nothing like that on the market I have to do it by myself (and then sell it to other winemakers who I am sure need it as well).<p>The problem for me is the middle ground: something I found quite interesting (say nicely formatted tabs app with timing, sounds, fretboards...) and might use it from time to time. But the novelty wears off soon and I am not desperate to have it in my life. Still these kinds of projects need sustainable effort to make it work so I just keep working less and less on it and then quit.",1418390213

With influxdb you can log {&quot;section&quot;: &quot;front page&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;browser&quot;: &quot;firefox&quot;, &quot;hits&quot;: 1} as a single metric and then use an SQL-like query to filter by section / user / browser (or any combination of those) as and when you want to.<p>TBH the only thing I miss going from graphite to influxdb+grafana is the tree of metrics (grafana has autocomplete once you start typing, but you can&#x27;t just browse) and a few of the rendering functions (moving average).",1418390114

If I am not going to give up on everything and die, then I will try my hardest in learning to live. There is nothing really that I can build that matters more than caring about my life. So, I just try to amass as much skill as I possibly can, pretty much all I do is study and try to develop skill and add more skill on top of existing skill, I relate almost everything to mathematics, computer science, logic, and code, aside from trusting a small subset of individuals with my physical presence. I hug my family and talk to my cat. That&#x27;s my life. Sit at computer, code, food, sleep, exercise. Maybe it seems like I have no inspiration because there is no &#x27;push&#x27; I need to do. I just &#x27;do that&#x27; and &#x27;that&#x27; is mostly, more or less, what I want my life to be.

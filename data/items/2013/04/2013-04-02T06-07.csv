5478031,comment,5476302,5477476,3,0,anon4atruestory,,,"When drugs are used illegally, reporting on their adverse effects is generally shoddier than for on-label prescription usage, for a variety of reasons. In my personal experience, Provigil is an extremely effective and powerful tool, and like any power tool, should be treated with the proper respect or you're likely to get hurt. See my other comment a few threads below for more information and context, but I wanted to reply quickly to this (admittedly excellent) resource because it didn't seem to have a whole lot to say about the potential dangers, and as I've personally experienced them (and still find Modafanil to be a drug worth taking on occasion) I thought I'd try and make sure that others like me can learn from my mistakes without the need for their permanent consequences. The long and short - If you choose to use Modafanil, drink plenty of water, try not to use it as a sleep replacement (48-72 hours without sleep) more than once or twice a month, and fortify and replenish your body with quality food before, during, and after. If you are reckless, the lack of sleep combined with a histamine agonist can have effects that are roughly the opposite of benadryl, including an increased propensity for immune response (including allergies), that depending on your misfortune may become a permanent part of your life.",1364885952

5478020,comment,5476302,5477839,3,0,malandrew,,,"Diagnosed narcoleptic here with an MSLT score of about ~2min.<p>I've been taking Modafinil @ 200-400mg/day off and on since 2003, with probably a total of 4 years of usage in that time span, together with Xyrem for about a year in 2004 and punctuated by ritalin for a year or so around 2008-09. I personally only take it when I have to and try to avoid taking it on days on which I think I can manage without it.<p>Yes, it can be habit forming, but only psychologically and only weekly. I can totally see it being habit forming when ""taken together with"" a demanding worklife. If you aren't working lots of hours where you need to stay focused the entire time, there is little motivation to take modafinil. It's not any ""fun"" and the ""high"" you get is not from the drug itself, but the ego boost from getting a lot of shit done. People don't get ""addicted"" to the drug but to the feeling of productivity.<p>On top of that, it has little to no side effects. It might have exacerbated my bruxism slightly but that's about it.<p>However there is one risk with it and that is sleep deprivation. My number one advice to anyone that takes it is to never take it after about 11am in the morning (or less than 12 hours before the time you intend to sleep). If you follow that one rule, I can't foresee people having any issues with it long term. The problem with taking it less than 12 hours before bedtime is that it has a half-life of about 6-8 hours meaning that it's mostly worn off by 12 hours and sleep ""no longer feels optional at that point. This approach lets your feel awake, alert, productive and focused during your daylight hours when you plan to be working.<p>If however someone does break that rule, it's easy to lapse into a messed up sleep cycle and that itself can lead to someone feeling more and more tired the longer it goes on leading to trying to fix the problem with more modafinil.<p>The side effects cited from Internal Medicine (hypersensitivity reactions and neuropsychiatric adverse effects) aren't a product of modafinil per se, but a constant accumulated lack of sleep. Add to that the fact that the symptoms of sleep deprivation are pretty much indistinguishable from schizophrenia and you have an explanation from those side effects.<p>I doubt that abuse of this drug would do anything to impact my ability to get this medicine even if such abuse was widespread. It's not a trivial thing for someone to fake a diagnoses with narcolepsy, like you can do with ADD/ADHD or anxiety disorders. A bona fide diagnosis requires a polysomnogram and MSLT if you don't show any serious signs of apnea.  If one were to try to fake it, they probably need advice from an actual narcoleptic like myself to know what to say and do to fake one or both of those tests.<p>Plus, modafinil isn't even the most restricted narcolepsy drug. Xyrem is, which is basically pharmaceutical grade GHB. That drug only comes from one pharmacy in the country and is overnighted in massive boxes so that it can't be trivially stolen. The boxes are huge for two tiny bottles. TBH the only thing that prevents narcoleptics from getting access to a drug they need like xyrem (a necessity if you have cataplexy) are drug costs. If you don't have group insurance or if narcolepsy/cataplexy are pre-existing conditions for your insurance, then Xyrem will set you back around $50k to $80k a year last time I checked. I don't know street prices for drugs, but I imagine that they are 100-200x more expensive than a legitimate prescription. The reason for the cost is the fact that it's an orphan drug, meaning that the costs of bringing it to market are spread across a very small potential target market. Even that's kind of absurd since it's sleep benefits were known from back in the 80s when GNC sold it OTC well before any clinical trials. FWIW Faking cataplexy is largely impossible if your doctor performs the blood test available to diagnose it.",1364885620

5478016,comment,5477403,5477983,1,0,GrahamsNumber,,,"Don't get me wrong, like I said, there's plenty of jobs@domain.com that actually read and reply to applications, but it's a black hole a lot of the times, and I tend to avoid it.<p>I would suggest you use something like Name@domain.com. Perhaps you could do a separate e-mail just for hiring. Say your email is john.smith@domain.com, do a jsmith@domain.com just for hiring. That way, you can just auto-forward to someone else when you need him to take over. Here's a reason why I think this would also benefit your hiring a bit. I usually address my emails with the name of the person, so I'd open with ""Hi John"", ""Hey John"", ""Dear John"", or some variation of that. I can't do that at jobs@domain.com, because there may be multiple people reading that, so I'd have to do something more generic. What that means for you, the employer, is that I actually read your post and wrote the e-mail, and not just bcc'd you together with another hundred guys.<p>I'd never think sending feedback would be a bad choice. Of course, don't send something offensive like ""you're the worst programmer ever"". I don't think anyone would be offended by ""we're looking for someone with more experience in X"", which is what I suggested.<p>As for the way I phrase some of my emails: I've only send the ""is the job still available"" kind only a couple of times, but perhaps surprisingly I got some of the best contacts this way. Perhaps because the guy on the other end was open to going past that. In fact, the best hiring process I've had with someone I had emailed with ""I've attached my resume"" when in fact I hadn't. Few jokes later, I had a job offer.",1364885498
5478015,comment,5473128,5473128,4,0,vijayboyapati,,,"As Moldbug wrote: ""In any economy, there exists no less than one commodity or security of inelastic volume which is overvalued due to reservation demand. Ie: one scarce good which is money."" Bitcoin's increasing price is a sign that it's further along in its passage to monetization. Gold, too, experiences the same phenomena of being ""overvalued"". I.e., being far above the price warranted by its use value. In the same way gold is also partially monetized (in particular it has large reservation demand from central banks)<p>Buying bitcoin is essentially a bet on the probability it will be monetized. This probability will wax and wane in the minds of the population participating in the bitcoin market, who in turn will be influenced by media perceptions, the actions of the state etc. So the price will no doubt be quite volatile. But the increase in price, based on an increase in reservation demand, is self-reinforcing. It increases the desire of merchants to accept bitcoin in payment (since there are now a greater pool of holders who have greater savings looking for an outlet to spend those savings). And as new merchants begin accepting bitcoin in payment, the reservation demand increases. These two causalities are linked together and reinforce each other. At some point they become entrenched enough that the whole thing ""lifts off"", so to speak, and the commodity becomes money. Interestingly, the same thing happens with gold, except that one of the two causalities is short-circuited by the state: the reservation demand for gold does not spur merchants to accept gold in payment, because that is made illegal by the state. Thankfully bitcoin is so well engineered that the problem of the state banning use in transactions is essentially moot (no offense ""Chuck"" Schumer).",1364885469

Based on my own experiences going through trying to learn to code, a few comments:<p>""In the end, I really want to learn how to code""<p>No, in the end you want to learn how to solve problems.<p>If you start with a problem and try to learn the minimal of whatever coding/ language/ package/ software is required to solve the problem, you will be much further ahead.

What about when we've grown too big for me to personally respond to every applicant, and we have dozens of HN posts (or other places with similar content) pointing to an email which is no longer useful.<p>I think jobs@circleci.com is the best approach, but welcome better suggestions. It also has the advantage that everyone in the company gets it, so we can all look them over if needs be.<p>> If I respond to your post 3 days after the posting date. [...] I obviously know the job is still available, I'm looking for a 2-line reply so I know you actually give a damn.<p>Don't do this. Put yourself in my shoes. Do you think I know you're looking to see if I give a damn? Which I don't, because I get dozens of job emails a day, and most of them don't come across as stupid (which that does).<p>> Acknowledge my application.<p>Totally agree. I respond to all applicants, even if that response is a polite rejection. The only things I ignore (actually, I mark them as spam) are recruiters and outsourcers.<p>> If you have ""We get sooooo many applications, we'll only contact those we're interested in"" I go ""Bullshit!"".<p>I think you'd be surprised. Dozens a day. And I have another job - actually running a company.<p>> Optional: This might not be for everyone, but I personally think it is a good approach. Whenever you send a rejection, state why you're rejecting the candidate<p>Warning for others: DO NOT DO THIS. I did this for the first 3 people who ever applied. It took me 30 minutes to compose those emails, and I went into considerable detail. Oh, and it was really harrowing to write negative things about another human being, especially one who hadn't asked for it.<p>One replied, and was very thankful for the feedback and promised to work on it. He replied a few months later thanking me again. Two didn't reply, which means my hour was not only wasted, but I actually sent feedback that they didn't want or appreciate (which means they now think I'm an asshole).<p>Now, I send feedback to anyone who asks for it, and sometimes will have a back-and-forth about it.<p>> Instead, put in as much effort as I do.<p>In this, and the other things which others have described as ""a sense of entitlement"", you're committing the same crime as the employers: only caring about and seeing your side of the story. I've been on both sides in recent history, and both sides (and both ""Dear HN"" pieces) suffer from not looking at the other person's position (something which is useful in nearly all walks of business, as well as life).",1364884315

The GNU tools were a crucial tool on every Unix by the mid-1980s, and indeed played a major role in making Unix useful.  While you can argue about whether it was a good idea to try to rebrand Stallman's ""free software"" movement as ""open source"", it doesn't make sense to argue that Unix was somehow unconnected to the free software movement.<p>Furthermore, there was already a movement afoot to build software under free-software licenses <i>in commercial companies</i> many years before the Open Source Initiative was founded: Sun, DEC, HP, and so on, were members of the X Consortium, which continued the development of X-Windows as free software many years after its original (academic) maintainers had stopped; Cygnus effectively took over maintenance of GCC and the rest of the GNU toolchain from the GNU project by about 1990; Sun published NFS, Yellow Pages, Sun RPC, and so on under free-software licenses starting in the mid-1980s, and later funded development on Emacs; Lucid forked Emacs to form the basis of its IDE, giving us XEmacs and its high-quality open-source C compiler, lcc.  None of this was ""regular academic sharing of ideas""  while these were companies with academic roots, they were judged by standards of business, not academia  and it <i>all</i> happened on Unix.<p>And many of the people who built that open-source software that made Unix what it was were also founding members of the Open Source Initiative.<p>At the same time, there was perhaps an order of magnitude more programmers using IBM PCs under MS-DOS.  The only significant open-source software I can think of from this era on that platform is the various open-source FORTH systems.  There was lots of user-group and BBS-scene software, but it was usually distributed without source, or occasionally with source, but under ""no commercial use"" licenses  you could maybe even put the IBM PC BIOS source code into this category.  There were occasional exceptions  the WaZOO source code from Opus, say, or PC-HACK, ported from Unix  but not many.<p>So I think that it's perfectly fair to describe the ""code sharing involved in Unix"" as a unique nascent movement, separate from the ""regular academic sharing of ideas"", which at some point decided to (mostly) call itself the ""open source"" movement.",1364884122

TL;DR - Modafanil is in many ways a wonder drug, but it is absolutely not free of side effects. You need to know (and monitor) your own body, and not ignore physiological imbalance, even if it seems trivial. Drink a lot of water, eat lots of nutritious food while taking it, and for the love of god, do not stay up more than 2 or 3 nights in a row without sleep. It's not worth it. Read on below if you want context]<p>I wanted to provide a personal story to counter a lot of the enthusiasm and carelessness around modafanil. I'm a software engineer, and I've dabbled on and off with modafanil for a little less than a decade now, including several one-week runs of hardcore usage, without sleep, during contracting gigs in my early-mid twenties.<p>I'll start by saying that I still think modafanil can be extremely useful as a tool, and that, until I recently ran out, I would still take 100-200mg of modafanil if it were no more than once a week (with an effort to make it not more than twice a month), so I still feel the risks and unknowns can be worth the tradeoff. But make no mistake - modafanil is an effective medication, and like all effective medications, it has side effects, (light) mental habituation, and potentially life threatening side effects if used improperly.<p>At the end of one particularly rough 9 days or so of straight usage during a major release for a contract, averaging 3 hours of sleep once every two to three nights (and the rest solidly awake), I settled with the team at a 24-hour diner right before release, and had an all-potato breakfast. My stomach had been steadily gaining in acidity over the week, but I had ignored it. A couple of hours later, I threw up and accidentally inhaled a small amount of the most corrosive stomach acid I've ever felt. When I coughed it out I tasted blood, and shortly after found it harder to breath. The bleeding was so profuse that I found it necessary to handstand over a hotel bathroom sink to let it all drain out without choking me. Luckily the person who had dropped me off was nearby - I phoned him and he took me straight to the hospital. I never had experienced that level of lung trauma before, and I've had a lot of hospitalization events related to some pretty severe asthma in my life, and it was this moment more than any other in my life that I seriously considered that I might die. In the end, I made it out with a light lung infection, and was treated at the hospital for an allergic reaction. I've never been able to eat potatoes since without experiencing an allergic reaction.<p>I can't seem to find a citation for this right now, but I remember reading at one point that modafanil is an agonist in the histamine receptor family. I am not a neurologist, and I know that the histamine receptor family can have very contradictory effects due to them being a modulator of the release levels of neurotransmitters dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways, and is also more publicly famous as being the target of the antagonist, Benadryl. I generally think about the vigilance instilled by Provigil as the same kind of vigilance you may have experienced during the beginning stages of an infection. The immune system revs up, you get warmer, you don't want to move around as much (as opposed to amphetamine based stimulants that seem to give you physical energy you want to burn off), and you slip into a more introspective and determinedly focused state. But vigilance comes at a price, and if you keep burning carelessly through your internal resources without replenishing them, eventually you'll start burning the wick (you) too. Something will fail.

What is sacred about copyrights?<p>And what value is the owner of a media copyright actually providing to me anymore? They used to add value by distributing media, but now the media is obsolete because technology has given us faster, cheaper, and easier ways to share digital content.<p>The other thing these companies do is market the content and talent. But ""marketing"" is not a product, it has no value to the consumer. Their advertising even has negative value because it wastes my time--viewing it is another price that I pay in order to enjoy the content.<p>So if the copyright-owning companies don't have a value-add, why should I pay them for anything? Because they asked nicely? No, the only conceivable reason to do so is because the law says I have to. And why does the law say I have to? Because those companies wrote the law.<p>The law certainly isn't there to protect artists. Artists will always make art, regardless of whether others are able to buy exclusive legal rights to sell their art, or not.

But US mainstream economists through the twentieth century did not say that the economy came with large oscillations and busts.  How many US economists even in the late 1990s said that the economy would run into big busts in the future?  The people who predict correctly are marginalized by a media controlled by capital, and the Jim Cramers of the world are free to continue their panglossian bromides and predictions, no matter how often they turn up false.<p>Five hundred years ago, the HN class equivalents would be clergy and lower (and some upper) nobles.  The majority of people would be praising feudalism, saying that feudalism was common sense etc.  Now we are five centuries later, in a different economic system, and the majority of people here praise the economic system they are in as the best one, saying it makes sense etc.  In 1935, the intelligentsia in the USSR praised their economic system, said it was common sense etc. - why shouldn't they have?  The western world was in a depression while their economy went full steam ahead.  Despite the world having seen four economic systems (hunting-gathering, slavery, feudalism, capitalism), and the sparks of a possible fifth one (socialism), it's not surprising that the majority of people under the current economic system see it as being, unlike its three predecessors, as permanent, lasting forever, as being common sense etc.  The majority of people felt the same way about serfdom centuries ago.

He did this for no reason other than his dedication to helping a fellow entrepreneur.  Over dozens of email exchanges and in-person get togethers, he proved hands down, to be one of the most helpful, friendly, altruistic people I've met in the valley.  After a year building up this friendship and trust, he invested in our company, and he is consistently one of the first people I reach out to when I have real founder issues to discuss.<p>The OP has literally ZERO idea what reasons Jeff has for his decisions about the data on his site, not the least of which could be legal restrictions of the acquisition.  They provided, what looks like, ZERO background on why they wanted to talk to someone who was incredibly busy transitioning a startup into the hands of a new parent company.  Jeff was as polite as he needed to be when he responded to a completely context-less request for a call with, ""I'm sorry I can't right now.""  The OP does not know, beyond building a startup worth acquiring, and transitioning it, what else someone might have on their plate that would prevent them from having time to chat with someone who failed to provide any reason for their request.  Then, when Jeff asked point blank whether the OP was scraping data from his site, they responded with an ambiguous, ""not trying to do anything uncool. Still super eager to talk more. Happy to do so anytime.""<p>The OP apparently does not have to <i>try</i> to do something uncool.  This entire situation is unbelievably uncool, from the beginning of the communication, to their actions in between, to this post.  The only thing more shocking than the sense of entitlement displayed here, is that they, or anybody here, thinks this post documents anything other than a pure display of arrogance and entitlement by the OP.  They approached this whole situation with such a stark lack of professionalism that it would be laughable if they hadn't also decided to smear one of the nicest people I know in the process.<p>This post reflects an attitude that is a shining example of so many things wrong in the startup community, from the sense of entitlement, to the lack of common courtesy, to the manipulation of a situation for personal gain at the expense of others.  It is so unreal how easily people seek to tear down others, and worse, how quickly smart people jump on the bullshit bandwagon.<p>This post is a joke.  Nobody owes you anything because they built a site you enjoyed.  If anybody owes anybody anything, the OP owes Jeff Miller an apology for this time wasting bullshit.",1364882469

I'm specifically not talking about HR recruiters, but founders/co-founders/engineers that do hiring. I don't find anything more frustrating than having 10 emails back and forth, and then suddenly silence. I'm sorry, but I think this is utter lack of respect.<p>As for contacting the founders personally, that's why I ceased sending e-mails to generic jobs@foo.bar. Sure, sometimes that works, but I've found much better success by e-mailing people directly.<p>Asking my friends if they know any startups isn't really the point (besides, that wouldn't open up a large enough network). I'm talking more about HN posters specifically, because it's much easier to find an interesting startup, one that matches my skills and interests, from the larger selection base on HN. I'm wasn't looking for just any startup just because it's a startup. I was more trying to find one that matches my interests. I won't get into the passion argument again.

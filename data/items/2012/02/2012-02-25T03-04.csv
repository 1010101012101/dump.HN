3632107,comment,3631920,3631920,1,0,alanfalcon,,,"I don't think of Las Vegas as a place for much startup culture. But it's cheap to live here: buy a cheap house for the price of two months studio rental in SoCal, no income taxes, and if you can have a business reason like the local print shops then it's a nice business opportunity. And the low rent, I think, (and maybe the sales-to-tourists opportunities) leads to a thriving artist culture that could be convenient to tap into. Of course, that cheap house comes with a mandate for some good locks on doors and windows, keep the car in the garage, never leave the house during Summer months.<p>I guess a hustler might be able to get some Las Vegas Money to ""gamble"" on their startup to raise some capital, I don't know about that much though.",1330142259

3632095,comment,3628942,3630730,0,0,tobiasSoftware,,,"First a disclaimer, I am a major Python fan.  While I don't wish to argue with you, I'd like to share a personal experience that made me realize the advantages of popularity.  I began my hobby programming with a language named AutoIt that pretty much no one knows about.  This is a Windows scripting language and began to use it to build mainstream software.  A couple years into that I realized my mistake and switched to Python.  The advantages I gained from using such a popular language were:<p>1. Tons of 3rd party libraries.  AutoIt had nearly none.  In Python I use Numpy, PIL, NLTK, OpenCV, and more.<p>2. The language worked.  AutoIt had bugs.  At least one bug was part of the language, I found it through coding that would happen in a college level class.  Popular languages have bugs too, but they have been tested more thoroughly, and problems are pushed to be fixed more.<p>3. The language was supported.  AutoIt programs were thought to be a virus by my computer.  Python on the other hand is even supported by Eclipse, and I have been using PyDev lately.<p>4. The basic features were good.  AutoIt only had a list data structure nothing else.  While AutoIt had a lot of specialty functions, there were many more I ended up building from scratch that I should not have needed to.  Also, Python has lots of nice features, such as list comprehensions.<p>5. People knew what I was talking about.  Whenever I told people I coded in AutoIt, they were always confused and had no idea what I was saying.  I love being able to tell people I am a Python programmer and they are like, hey cool, do you like this feature?<p>Now AutoIt is an extreme example as I haven't heard of it even on Hacker News so the languages you mention might not have such problems.  But I'm guessing some of those problems exist in some form.  Just my two cents on a personal experience of how popularity can actually matter in some ways.",1330141760

First the point I was making was about <i>my</i> experience, I understand I do not have deep functional programming experience.  I don't perceive Python as being better than functional languages for <i>functional</i> programming, but rather I see it as offering the good functional qualities I personally have seen while still being good at other paradigms, I imagine if you desire pure functional programming it probably does not stack up to pure functional languages.<p>My experience is an AI class in Lisp and TA-ing a class that taught students Scheme and a lot of Python experience, so you are right, perhaps I should check out Haskell or ML for better readability.  Although I think Python discourages functional programming itself, from what I've seen it heavily encourages functional features, between lambda functions, functions as first class objects, and list comprehension which offers mapping, filtering, and reducing.  I know there are other functional features that I haven't been exposed to, but as far as the techniques taught at a college level class, I feel Python incorporates functional features beautifully, and I now find myself using functions as objects, lambdas, mapping, filtering, and reducing nearly every day I program.  I know the ""pure-ness"" of functional languages isn't there as Python encourages side effects, but as far as giving average programmers functional power while maintaining readability, I like Python's adaptation of functional techniques.",1330140866

History does seem to be skewed in favor of left handed leaders but it is just corollary at best.<p>Anyways, I do being that left handedness confers some intelectual capacity hence the IQ test but I think more that anything we think entirely foreign to right handers and I think this is why left handers seem to make intellectual leaps, not because they are smarter but because they mentally process the problem very different.<p>Anyone that follows my post knows that I am very vocal about whiteboard tests for programmers and the difference in how left handers think has a lot to do with my view point on whiteboard test. I think they filter out left handers by the very nature of how they are set up which is very much how a right hander thinks.<p>A buddy and I got in to a discussion about how I solve tough problems and I said well I close my eyes or go for a walk and I dream about it. He looked at me puzzled and said <i>you just dream it up?</i> and I said yes it seemed so foreign to him but to a left hander it will sound very familiar. We hand off problems to the creative processing center of our brain and it deals with it.<p>It is very different that the analytical part of the brain that sequentially breaks down an issue. Here is the deal though that dreaming, cannot be rushed, it comes when it comes and if someone cannot focus due to the environment <i>say an interview</i> one cannot activate the creative part of their brain. Hence I think the whiteboard in interview filters out the most creative individuals.",1330140466

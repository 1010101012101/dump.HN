The politician will think that assuming a powerful security organization and steep enough penalties domestically, you can probably eke a net benefit out of the technology outside of your nation-state with little downsides within you own.<p>This leads to a scary way of blunting the edge of the sword that a politician thinks could hurt them domestically, and I&#x27;m afraid that perhaps in some ways we&#x27;re going down that path (RIPA 2000 is a good example of that, any type of forced-key-disclosure type of thing, or any type of key escrow and tying laws to requiring key escrow.)

As a miner your share of that fixed pool of available coins is determined by your hashing power relative to the overall hashing power of all miners.  So if you control 30% of the hashing power you should on average get 30% of the coins mined each day.  Your profits are then determined by your costs and the value of a bitcoin when converted to the currency your costs are denominated in.<p>* The constant amount actually changes periodically when the coinbase reward is adjusted downward but that only happens about once every 4 years and historically exchange rate price appreciation has outstripped the reduced coinbase mining rewards.  eventually the coinbase reward will go to zero and the number of coins that go to miners each day will be their relative share of the total fees being paid by users transacting on the network.  Miners choose which transactions to include in a mined block so in the future a large miner may have some pricing power over transactions because they could refuse to process any transaction with a fee that falls below some threshold.",1450752373

The way the\ncost estimate is determined is through how Bitcoin acts as a decentralized waste heat creator\nthat activates and deactivates heat generation based on market participation and pricing\nsignals. What do the randomizations necessary for cryptography and the waste heat produced\nby computing devices have in common? One word: “exergy,” a term of art describing the\nmaximum useful work possible during a process that brings a system into equilibrium with a\nheat reservoir. Exergy is always destroyed in the seigniorage hashing process - for example - if\na token&#x27;s value increases to $1,000, this means that at most $1,000 worth of waste heat will be\ngenerated somewhere in its creation.<p>From my reading of the text, it&#x27;s not so much the additional hash power that&#x27;s valuable, it&#x27;s the additional money spent building and operating the ASICs. In theory, the market cap of a proof-of-work system should approach its total cumulative cost to secure. The more watts you see being dumped into the environment calculating hashes, the more you should value Bitcoin.<p>If Bitcoin is worth less than its cost to mine, no rational miner will mine (if they want BTC they&#x27;ll just use their electricity budget to buy it on the market), so the competition (and therefore the cost) to mine each block goes down. If Bitcoin is worth more than its cost to mine, mining becomes profitable to anyone willing to put up the capex, so the competition (and therefore the cost) to mine each block goes up. There&#x27;s an equilibrium where the value of Bitcoin is equal to its cost to mine.<p>The actual price of bitcoin as seen by the average consumer is insulated from the cost to mine because of effects like speculation, perceived future movement, and the value provided by ease of spending / anonymity, so the economic theory isn&#x27;t really accurate, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a theory!",1450751972

I don&#x27;t know what the interplay between them, compiler writers, and standards bodies is. Yet, it seems C programmers react pretty negatively to anything changing their language even here. Just imagine how much of UNIX or GCC might break if we did pre-fixed strings, a reversed stack, compiler-only pointer arithmetic, auto-bounds checks, and so on. It would all just...

But most of the cost of the stage is in manufacturing the engines and tanks, so it should add up to enormous savings, even if it&#x27;s relatively costly to reuse each stage compared to the theoretical limits.<p>Edit: the flip-side is that the reliability and robustness improvements from reusability may be as big a win as cost. Currently it costs tens of millions of dollars to launch a rocket to orbit, which means it&#x27;s almost never done except as part of a paid launch. Moreover, despite the seemingly high number of launches very few of those launches represent expanding the test-envelope much, every single launch is typically straight down the middle of the performance envelope, to maximize the chance of success. That results in learning very little about these vehicles despite how much they&#x27;ve been flown. By introducing reuse and dropping the cost of flight it may become possible to do real test programs, which would make it possible to determine the flight envelope characteristics of vehicles and help lead to improving designs over time.",1450751389

Probably not. So, I don&#x27;t include LISP in a C-replacement discussion given they&#x27;re in two, different ballparks. And LISP is universally hated by almost all programmers outside its own fans and those Clojure is attracting. That&#x27;s despite the fact that I promote its advantages elsewhere where they might get take-up. ;)<p>Now, back to imperative languages with some familiarity to C programmers. For allocation failure, some languages provide exceptions to handle such things but I usually recommend allocating what you need at the beginning and being sure you&#x27;ll know your max for later. Do the checks plus reserve early so you worry less from then. Shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. It&#x27;s work to keep in mind but straight-forward.<p>Far as string-handling, there&#x27;s safe libraries and approaches to it. We just use them with whatever performance or syntax hit we get if our language doesn&#x27;t do it inherently safe. The issues with it are why I recommend prefix strings for clean-slate stuff over null-terminated. If you can get away with it.

The idea is you pick a taboo word or activity to use in a way that causes no harm. Then, people rally against you over it. Then you laugh at them for their wasting time on it.<p>Alternatively, a form of this draws attention to how much true evil society tolerates under banner of &quot;acceptable behavior&quot; while they put energy into calling out harmless domain names that should get an eye roll at someone&#x27;s stupidity at worst.

But I know some Rails as well as some Angular, Backbone, and Knockout.<p>My ideas:<p>0) Isomorphism via a CoffeeScript-like language that compiles to JS and Python, or a full-stack Node framework written in a CoffeeScript-like language.<p>1) Folders for server, client, and shared code. And maybe more folders to build a Replicant/Android client with something akin to NativeScript.<p>2) Support server-side rendering for faster loading in the browser (a la Ember FastBoot).<p>3) A Model which contains the definitive representation of real-world objects. DB interaction, validations, forms, serializers, etc. all derive as much as possible from the model. Model &quot;classes&quot; have field instances which, in one place, define how they fit in the database and what developers/end-users can do with them. Inspired by Django and, to a lesser extent, Ember.<p>4) Don&#x27;t Don&#x27;t Repeat Repeat Yourself Yourself. See 0, 1, and 3.<p>5) Real-time with no need for more than one or two lines of code to opt in and make it work. New, updated, or deleted models publish automatically, notifying something like a Django class-based view, which pushes the new data to all clients subscribed to that view.<p>6) Declarative templates like Ember. But even a basic operation, such as updating a template when an attribute in the model changes, has a default (replace part of the template to reflect the new data) which can be overridden easily to get animated updates, without jumping through hoops and/or accessing private APIs.<p>7) First-class support for indented languages such as Emblem, Sass, and CoffeeScript (or a similar language).<p>8) Free as in Freedom. Preferably AGPL, but LGPL or Apache--with its explicit patent grant--could work if a more permissive license is needed to promote adoption.<p>Your ideas?",1450750606

Some of the most awkward problems then happen when you can’t even clean up properly at that point, for example by deleting a temporary file or committing a pending transaction on a database, because of the failure, and so you wind up with some externally observable side effects of your program that can’t be fixed.<p>Another awkward area is running out of system resources such as memory or processes/threads, which many high level programming languages aren’t well equipped to handle gracefully.

I doubt FHE is a good solution for your project, though. The technique is not quite ready for primetime due to seriously slow performance.

7786078,comment,7783550,7785183,3,0,eshvk,,,"> This table of contents is beginning to seem very familiar (I&#x27;ve done Google&#x27;s internal machine-learning course and looked at several other courses/tutorials on the net), but what I&#x27;m wondering is: how do you do the more basic operations of feature and parameter selection?<p>I have thought about this problem for a long time. Initially, I used to think it was a mere matter of finding clever Machine Learning algorithms that could auto-magically detect features for you. There are others who think it is a matter of throwing a bunch of subject matter experts into the problem and building feature vectors. I have worked with both philosophies of people. I think the answer lies somewhere in the middle. And it is a fucking hard problem.<p>You need to do some clever algorithmic work. Maybe use a PCA or your favorite dimensionality reduction trick but also be clever enough (mathematically that is) to realize when PCA is brittle and when not to use it. You also need to have enough understanding of the subject to be able to ask the right questions from your subject matter experts. It is easy to get five people in a room and ask them to describe a song. But it is much harder to find out the right way of asking them: Is this song the kind of song that you would dance to while drunk on three beers in a podunk town in the Mid West? That requires experience to get that sort of intuition.<p>The only thing I can recommend (pun unintended) is to keep solving these problems, focus on the domain(s) that you are deeply passionate about. Don&#x27;t spread yourself too thin and make yourself to be a general purpose Machine Learner. That is the only way to  get to building beautiful end to end products.",1400788716

The GP imagines that, if there were more women in his workplace, everything would continue as it is now except there would be more women.  This is not an absurd expectation.  But if we take the OP at face value (which I do) then we have to conclude that lots of women are facing harassment or other problems.

Republicans on Senate Judiciary and pro-reform groups made it a top goal, but some Democratic members and trial lawyers warned that fee shifting could keep companies from pursuing legitimate lawsuits.<p>But it goes on to say:<p>> Earlier this month, Senate negotiators began to coalesce around compromise language from Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) that included milder litigation reforms. That effort, however, frayed as universities and other major patent holders argued the measure would have negative consequences for the patent system.<p>It&#x27;s Politico saying that universities and other major patent holders also argued against the measure, not Democrats.<p>> Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) played a decisive, behind-the-scenes role in the legislation‚Äôs fate, according to sources on and off the Hill. Reid told Leahy he could not put the bill on the floor given the opposition from trial lawyers, pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology giants, the sources said. Reid‚Äôs office did not comment for this story.<p>You characterize this as Reid simply trying to &quot;spread the blame&quot; but it wasn&#x27;t the trial lawyers that sent a letter to Leahy the morning the bill was killed. From the ArsTechnica article linked above:<p>> Early this morning, several groups opposing the bill denounced those provisions, promising they would be united in their opposition to any bill that included them. &quot;Many of the provisions would have the effect of treating every patent holder as a patent troll,&quot; read a letter sent out by the Innovation Alliance, which was signed by the American Association of Universities and the biotechnology trade group BIO.<p>Your point about fee-shifting is absolutely wrong. Universities and small patent-holders oppose it, because litigation is always uncertain even when you&#x27;ve got a good case overall. You can never be sure what&#x27;ll happen in a Markman hearing, or what a jury will do, or whether all your claims will hold up in light of developments that arise over the course of litigation. This is particularly true because the law requires you to bring all your claims at once, or forfeit the ones you don&#x27;t bring.

The words game is really cool, you find yourself digging through letters as quickly as possible while trying to form the word but you also have to watch to make sure you are actually on the right track before you shove too many out there, and watch the other player too.  The game is scored by giving you points for getting the word but you also lose points for every letter you shove in that isn&#x27;t right.  If you want you can just shove the whole stack in front, you&#x27;ll instantly solve the puzzle but with an enormous negative score.<p>Something about that particular game is an experience I haven&#x27;t had with either physical or digital games before, whereas most physical/digital hybrids I&#x27;ve seem could just as easily be done purely in one or both realms.<p>The tangram seemed like a bit of a dud for that reason, for example.

Indiscriminate disinfectants kill benign microbes as well as pathogenic microbes, leaving a clean surface to be colonized by the first species that land on it, whether good or bad.<p>The fine article details a practice wherein rather than apply a scorched-earth policy to all microbes, known good species are intentionally cultivated to both deny a beachhead to invading pathogenic microbes, and for other benefits, such as removal of unpleasant body wastes.<p>Centuries of scientific inquiry has shown that there really is no such thing as a clean and sterile surface outside of certain specially-constructed rooms with carefully managed airflows.  Soaps and shampoos simply favor species able to spread and multiply quickly.  when used frequently enough, they also prevent humans from becoming a disease vector.<p>That frequency is a matter for investigation.  It may be that only physicians, nurses, and hospital staff who always wash thoroughly before each and every patient contact are actually contributing to public health, and that people who wash every time they pass a sink during the day--maybe once per 3 hours--are simply breeding for triclosan resistance and favoring the tenacious and rapidly multiplying species.",1400786580

It also doesn&#x27;t help when firms collude to make switching firms even harder, eg: when Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Pixar, Lucasfilm and eBay agreed not to recruit each other&#x27;s employees.*<p>To think organized labor is antiquated because the economy has moved on from single-company mining towns is naive. The simple fact is that corporations don&#x27;t have your best interest in mind any more than you can claim you always have your employer&#x27;s best interests at heart.<p>*<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Li...</a>",1429203593

In terms of actually processing the transaction, yes it&#x27;s generally true that it takes about the same time to process a deal regardless of size (there are legal, accounting, regulatory, basic DD, etc steps that happen in every deal). That&#x27;s totally independent from the &quot;go&quot; or &quot;no go&quot; call that call that ultimately needs to be made by the acquirer though, which is the actual driver of the deal. It&#x27;s a lot easier/quicker to make the &quot;go&quot; call when the stakes are low. Once an acquirer decides with conviction that they want to do a deal, it&#x27;s pretty smooth sailing.

9389170,comment,9388176,9388807,0,0,genericuser,,,"They tried anti-depressants after 2 years of his condition persisting.  Trying a single anti-depression med is a perfectly reasonable attempt at treating the issue if the information the doctors have lines up with depression.  Even when the medication does not work it usually provides them with more information so the solutions they try get closer to something which will work hopefully.<p>The entire field of medicine is heuristic, basically making educated guesses as to what the collections of symptoms indicate.  You try something see if it works, if it doesn&#x27;t try something else based on the information available.  When your patient is a young child, you have different problems gathering that information than with an adult, kids may not notice or know how to describe something that is wrong, and adults will often omit things they consider embarrassing.<p>As someone who has had anxiety and depression for the 12 years since I graduated high school, the doctors I have met have been nothing like the notion of doctors you have, and while I am sure there are doctors whose first priority is pushing pills characterizing doctors in general as such I do not believe to be accurate.  I&#x27;ve seen physicians and psychiatrists both of which tried to gather as much information as they could asking questions and running tests before recommending any treatment or even really suggesting what was wrong with me.  They would often recommend things like more exercise, less time in front of computers and sitting, and finding hobbies after all tests came back showing nothing abnormal with my body.  Both seemed to agree it was probably not a physical malady with physicians eventually recommending psychiatrists and psychiatrists recommending psychologists.  Every time after a couple months of therapy not working they would try another; they were very hesitant to recommend medication.  When they did they would have me check in weekly to give them updates, always switching me off of it if I indicated any side effects or just that things hadn&#x27;t gotten better after a period of time in which it should. Eventually I would give up and stop trying new treatments even though they indicated they had not exhausted all options.  After a few years I would try again.<p>Only recently, after starting up this chain of diagnoses again about 8 months ago, did I find relief.  The psychiatrist tried yet another therapy and two medications, which I had not been on before but were similar to the ones which had more positive effects previously.  Both wound up having the same negative side effects.  He then reluctantly tried a third, which was in a completely different class of meds, saying he tries his best not to prescribe it due to it having nasty withdrawal. Low and behold, 2 weeks in for the first time in 12 years I was feeling like I remember normal being on month 4 now and still feel great.<p>Different things work for different people because depression and many other things in the medical world are effectively a name for a collection of symptoms and not a specific malady.  The doctors I have seen seem to recognize that and respect that, and generally seem to prefer non-medication based treatments when they have hope it would work.",1429203204

It can also be harmful for people whose brain quirks don&#x27;t fit well into a role that&#x27;s valued by society.<p>There&#x27;s a difficult line to find there; what kind of neuroatypical behaviour should or shouldn&#x27;t be treated? Most people can agree that depression needs to be treated, because it&#x27;s harmful to the sufferer with no benefit. Or if someone is hearing messages from aliens and running away from home and wandering about alone in altered mental states, it&#x27;s fairly uncontroversial to put them on antipsychotics, even with the negative side-effects.<p>But on the other hand, the idea of medicating ADHD kids is massively controversial, because the argument can be made that for many people diagnosed with it are either misdiagnosed, or are just bored or learn differently. But I also know ADHD people who legitimately cannot function if they don&#x27;t take their medicine. What should be medicated or what shouldn&#x27;t?<p>Or here&#x27;s an even more borderline case: what if someone is convinced that they&#x27;re hearing messages from the beyond, and decides to spend the next ten years writing a book about how to live at peace with the world? What if the book doesn&#x27;t make sense? Should they be medicated, because they&#x27;ve clearly broken with reality? Or should they be let alone, because there&#x27;s a remote outside chance that maybe we&#x27;re all wrong and they&#x27;re on to something? Should they see a psychiatrist or a counsellor, who they can talk to and can keep track of how well they&#x27;re doing? If so, should that person take an authority role, or should they be someone to be worked with to reach a mutually agreeable course of medication (which may be none at all)?<p>Hence movements centred around neuroatypical people, and this narrative that they&#x27;re potentially a next stage in human evolution. Certainly, there are plenty of neuroatypical people who have desirable traits because of it that could very well become the norm, but there are also plenty of people whose traits are simply going to be selected against. It&#x27;s an incredibly attractive narrative for those people, though, because society doesn&#x27;t tend to value them as people as much as &#x27;neurotypical&#x27; people, which is absolutely terrible.<p>I personally think that there are three big takeaways for this:<p>1. People are people, and should be valued as such.\n2. Not everyone has a special talent that is valued by society, and that&#x27;s okay. See #1.\n3. Medication isn&#x27;t fire-and-forget. It&#x27;s something that needs to be constantly re-evaluated and carefully managed.",1429203046

There are many alternatives already to silicon transistors, but just like with solar panels, before they become useful and practical for the mass market you need to invest many billions in them to make cheap enough solar panels happen. When the silicon transistor and the current way of building chips is dead and buried, chip companies will put their billions into something else.<p>It does bother me slightly that this &quot;computing progress&quot; will continue to be called Moore&#x27;s Law though.

We know where the GC has to look for root references and where it doesn&#x27;t have to look.<p>In C, if we have a pointer p which is the last reference to some object, and is not used any more, and add the line &quot;p = NULL&quot;, hoping to drop a reference so the object can be reclaimed, there is no guarantee that the compiler actually generates the code which does the assignment. Since the variable has no next use, and the compiler doesn&#x27;t know anything about garbage collection, the assignment looks like wasteful, dead code that should be optimized away.  Even if the scope finishes executing, the compiler can leave behind a memory location which still references the object.<p>Here is something else, not related to GC. In assembly language, we can make ourselves a calling convention for variadic functions which know how many arguments they have. As we build up the higher level language, it will have nicely featured variadic functions.<p>In C, we are stuck with <stdarg.h> which doesn&#x27;t have a mechanism for the callee to know where the arguments end.

Our software was (supposedly) platform-agnostic, so we did our development in RHEL and ran on various platforms with various flavors of Linux.  There we had examples of real hardware, but had not constructed a full-example production system when I left.  All the Linux installs on target hardware were heavily stripped down and configured for real-time operation, though, so we couldn&#x27;t actually do development on them.<p>Now I&#x27;m doing a combination of R&D, packaged software, and bespoke software for NLP where our customers can run (theoretically) on whatever systems they want.  I develop in Ubuntu LTS and test occasionally in a Windows 7 VM.  Our customers so far run our software on various flavors of Windows, RHEL, or Ubuntu VMs that we package for them.

Only some DSPs will be able to efficiently handle single-frame data processing, but they have the help of dedicated address generators and lightweight interrupts synchronized to the digital interface.<p>If you write &quot;process however much audio data is ready&quot;, then you already imply that your CPU will <i>not</i> be up to speed to process 48000 interrupts/second reliably and you need some buffering.<p>And if you have to assume that sometimes you&#x27;ll miss 100 samples (which, then, you&#x27;ll process en-block), this means that to work reliably, you&#x27;ll have to start at least 100 samples early so that you don&#x27;t miss the deadline of the DAC, because the DAC <i>will</i>, with intractably output one sample every 48000th of a second. This already implies some kind of periodic processing of blocks, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>(and yes, such a scheme will theoretically allow you to half the latency from something to 2<i>period-size to 1</i>period-size + the time for processing)<p>Third, a lot of the algorithms for processing audio can be implemented much more efficiently if you have a known block size and don&#x27;t have to calculate your filters or convolutions with constantly changing number of samples for every step.<p>Also efficiency of processing will decrease (reloading the cache after each interrupt when switching from processing plugin to processing plugin), so the time spent on calculating per frame will go up if your period size gets smaller. At one point you&#x27;ll need exactly one &quot;period size&quot; to calculate one period size worth of samples: That&#x27;s the maximum your machine can handle, and at that point you&#x27;ll have a latency of your &quot;period size&quot;*2, which is exactly the same as running with a fixed period-size ;-). And as you can choose the period-size rather freely (maybe completely arbitrary, maybe 2^n, depends on the chipset/hardware) there&#x27;s no disadvantage left.",1429200447

This person didn&#x27;t know anything about UK literature, or even what the Booker Prize was, but was very eager to get rid of the page regardless.

I think they would be more likely to need it for a second stage than the Heavy&#x27;s core, because SSECO occurs very far down range, and at such a high speed that the rocket cannot make it back to the launch pad without a great deal of fuel.<p>Alternatively, they could be planning to launch from Texas, and recover some stage(s) in Florida.<p>*edit: in another comment on this discussion, kllrohg mentioned that SpaceX&#x27;s stated intent has been to land all stages back at the launch site.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9388762"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9388762</a><p><a href=""http://www.space.com/13140-spacex-private-reusable-rocket-el.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.space.com/13140-spacex-private-reusable-rocket-el...</a>.",1429200122

I searched on Google Scholar for &quot;vegan attitudes GMO&quot; and found several articles, often in the journal <i>Appetite</i>, that seemed relevant but were behind a paywall.  The first result is &quot;Attitudes towards genetically modified and organic foods&quot;, by Saher, Lindeman, and Hursti.<p>I also did a Google web search for the same terms and found, among other things, several articles by pro-GMO vegans complaining that it was common for other vegans to be anti-GMO (based on their personal experience, not studies).  The former felt that widespread vegan opposition to GMOs was unfortunate because it would make it less appealing for people to go vegan (for example because the range of available foods would appear more restricted), or because it could make vegans appear indifferent or hostile to scientific progress, among other concerns.",1429200078

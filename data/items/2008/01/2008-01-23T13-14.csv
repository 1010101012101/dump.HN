102782,comment,102751,102751,0,0,mixmax,,,"According to the article the problem is that the harware vendor and the software vendor is the same, and since these are big companies with no particular incentives for creating great software it ends up being mediocre. That is true.<p>The solution offered is splitting hardware vendors and software vendors. Unfortunately I think that if you call Nokia and tell them that they won't return your calls.<p>It is a classical monopoly situation, and while I agree that it would be a great soultion it is totally pie in the sky wishful thinking.",1201096455

102780,comment,102452,102452,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think the problem with Reddit (and Digg, and almost every other popular social news site) is algorithmic. The pattern is the same every time one of these sites becomes popular - it starts out with a small group of insightful people that submit and vote on content that they find interesting. The reason it works is that they have similar taste. Kind of like hacker news at the moment. Once the site grows, however, the initial group gets diluted and the site is swarmed with content that is not necessarily core content for the original group. And the new arrivals vote up the material that is submitted by the other new arrivals, thus diluting the site to the lowest common denominator. This is why Reddit is now filled with Ron Paul, conspiracy theories, LOLcats, and all sorts of other crap.<p>It is possible, and in my opinion not all that hard, to solve this algorithmically.<p>One way would be to make mod points weighted, so that members that have signed up early, have high karma, have the same taste (based on their upmods and submissions) as the core group have mod points that count for more than new arrivals that have yet to build any credibility.<p>Another way would be to not let new arrivals submit stories until they reached a certain karma. This would mean that submitted stories would stay more true to the original idea.<p>Another way would be to only let users have a certain amount of mod points that would be renewed after x days, spurring users to use them more sparingly, and stopping users that up/downmod everything that is not in their particular interest.<p>Yet another way would be to let the system learn from the users submissions and votes, and show stories based on this calculated using datamining. Maybe as a ""my {site}""<p>There are numerous other ways of doing it, these are just off the top of my head - and yes there are probably pitfalls in some or all of these ideas.<p>The point I want to make though is that the social news sites are pursuing the wrong goals once they start to gain traction. Instead of working on and constantly tweaking their algorithms they seem to focus more on new features, design, marketing or whatever.<p>There is an excellent business opportunity in creating back-end software to drive these sites and solve the algorithmic problems that, for some reason that is unclear to me, are so hard for these sites to do properly.",1201095847

From your own description, you're spending all your time at work and you're obsessed with that problem.<p>1/ you're not married. You're just the ghost of lovers. being married means something like <i>enjoying</i> spending time with your precious other.<p>2/ you're not travelling : you're moving from one airport to the other, with a brief pause in office and hotel between them. travelling means learning the country you're in. Don't delude yourself, you're not travelling except on the surface.<p>3/ you have no friends, as the rest you have no time for them.<p>I know the pull of a (code) project, especially when you're the boss. It can become an obsession, and eat over your personnal life. 
But believe me, beyond 9 hours of real work, you're worthless. Many excellent, brillant coders underlined that for men and in the end, I have to admit they are right.<p>To be better, you must be open to the world.",1201093754

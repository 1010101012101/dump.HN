1408220,comment,1407576,1407849,0,0,Lewisham,,,"One thing I would add to this (especially the gamers don't pay for stuff outside of games and their hardware) is that gamers don't have a lot of pain points that can be served by a scrappy startup.<p>They have communities (NeoGAF, Something Awful, Quarter to Nine, Penny Arcade) where they connect with like-minded people. There are usually so few in most towns that its easy to find local gamers if you want to (hobby stores, mostly) but usually gamers don't. Most of their gaming friends are online, and don't need a face-to-face.<p>What gamers want is new, shiny, and strongly entwined to the walled gardens being run by the console manufacturers. Unfortunately, those walls means the only people able to innovate effectively in the space are those very same console manufacturers.<p>If something cool was to come from doing a startup for gamers, it would need to lean heavily on APIs from other games, and having recently studied this (to be presented at [1]), while there are some read-only services, there's certainly not enough out there to start doing anything interesting with. I am not even sure that the data you could get from them would necessarily be of value. Gamers are interested in their data, but there's not a lot you can tangibly create from that data, unlike say being a poster printing company that uses the Flickr API. And if they don't click through ads, what are they going to buy?<p>I guess I'm a big naysayer as well, but I just don't see the obvious pain points that a startup could serve gamers. My gut feeling is there's lower hanging fruit in the web app sea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fdg2010.org/Main.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fdg2010.org/Main.html</a>",1275811069

At first, the situation could be interpreted as an exchange of a years of happy life for sleeping with somebody she considers attractive and would probably sleep with anyway.

1408210,comment,1407932,1408199,0,0,derefr,,,"I do agree with you; I was just taking the idea that ""the value of attending university is in the connections you make"" as assumed by the root of this thread, since I inevitably see that comment be used as a summary of these discussions. That idea <i>implies</i> that, if you don't <i>care</i> for the connections, self-teaching or learning in industry is somehow ""good enough."" And <i>that</i> thought implies that you could get the same connections, and therefore the same value, by just shacking everyone who <i>would</i> be attending the university together and letting them simmer in their own intellect.<p>While it's probably true in the marginal case—the 10x increase in tuition to go to an Ivy League school certainly doesn't cause a 10x increase in education, but it may well cause a 10x increase in connectivity—it's false in the general case. To simplify that: <i>some</i> university is <i>good</i>, but <i>more</i> university is not necessarily <i>better</i>. And you could probably get all the learning you wanted from just having your ""apartment building"" hire lecturers, and establish a good working relationship with professional research institutions (supposing most of the Ph.Ds, displaced, would end up working at Bell-Labs-like places.)",1275810190

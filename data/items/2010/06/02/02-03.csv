What true benefit does having the kernel maintainer also maintain ls and userland utilities?<p>The ports system is just an install time package optimization. For most users I don't see it having a benefit over pre-compiled binaries supplied by the distro. Sure it's nice to tune your system to it's optimal and build against current libs instead of updating, but I don't see how it's ""that much greater"" than .debs or .rpms which is the attitude that I see BSDers take. I've used Gentoo, a little FreeBSD and never felt like it was that much different than .debs.<p>I like that BSD is out there doing it's thing. I've even used it from time to time, but I always come back to Linux.<p>Linux just feels more open to ideas, more open to anyone playing around and crazy having ideas that end up working even though we laughed at them when we first heard. Whereas BSD seems more like a walled garden with the inner circle of kernel committees and secret rites. Linux always felt like it was moving forward, taking the pragmatic approach, and BSD was being dragged into future implementing things when they had to. Just my opinion.",1275447465

The report said that Lala's licenses were not transferrable on an acquisition.<p>Non-transferrable licenses are quite believable, if the record companies considered Lala an experiment to test the waters. They'd put safeguards in to make sure that the licenses didn't end up at some place like Apple, so they (the record companies) can decide the pace of growth of this kind of service.<p>Note that if you check the date of the acquisition, and the date of the close of the service, it's something very close to six months, which sounds like the kind of grace period that would be plausible to allow for shut down of the non-transferable licenses.",1275447399

Besides understanding tech, you generally need to have good people skills.  Between good social skills and having a good graps on the tech to serve your clients, you may not need to become a domain expert on DNS, or email spam filters, or CSS3, or JavaScript, or any number of tech skills (or business domain skills).  Sometimes being able to parse out a client's problem and bring in the appropriate freelance skills when necessary may be the best skill you have.<p>That said, you have to know yourself.

Sigh.)<p>Anyway, let's briefly entertain each argument.<p>Lack of compelling examples: there is a whole book, Real World Haskell, and there are 2000+ modules on HackageDB that you can read.  There is darcs.  There is xmonad.  There is GHC.  Etc., etc., etc.  If you want to read real Haskell code, it's one click away on any documentation page.  This argument is bullshit.<p>Lack of success stories: I like: <a href=""http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2007/05/does-xmonad-crash.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2007/05/does-xmonad-crash.h...</a>.  What is more compelling than ""I used a theorem prover to ensure that my GUI app can't crash""?  I know ""industry"" likes stories about some happy CTO that decided to use Foo and improved revenues 8 percent.  But the reality is, nobody actually cares about this.  People use languages because they know them and like them.  Why did I introduce Haskell at the bank where I work?  Not because of some happy CTO story.  I did it because I was confronted with a problem to solve, and decided that I would be best able to solve it with Haskell.  I was right; the project was a success.  I don't get to work on it much anymore because it never breaks.  Fail!<p>User unfriendly:  apt-get install ghc6.  cabal install whatever-from-hackagedb.  Easy.  It's even easier on Windows and OS X -- download the Platform, click the icon, done.  I run a production app on Windows (sadly), and installing Haskell is so trivial I don't even think about it.<p>Commerce unfriendly:  Industry likes source code, not proprietary products where the vendor dies and you are left with a codebase that can never be fixed.  Perl is widely accepted in industry, and nobody has ever made any money selling closed-source libraries.  There are a few closed-source Java, C#, and C++ libraries around, sure, but who cares?  If you like them, buy them.  If you don't, don't.  This is irrelevant.<p>Ill advised: lies.  Plain and simple.  Haskell might have been a so-so choice for real work back in Hugs days.  It was slowish, the FFI was meh, and there were no libraries.  Now GHC is one of the fastest programming language implementations available (like, faster than C++ and Java, sometimes).  It's FFI is great -- I had never done FFI work before a recent project (I always avoid Perl's XS, although I am pretty good at that now too...).  I read the docs, I typed some stuff into the REPL, and in a few hours, I had a binding that was less crashy than the underlying library.  It was wonderful.  Anything that saves time and makes software more reliable is good for industry.  Oh, and it's fast.  And I can interactively develop.  And I can write property-checking tests.<p>If this is bad for industry, I am very out of touch with industry.<p>Bad science: OK, I'm tired of reading this tripe now.<p>I know I've said it like 8 times, but this article is bullshit.  Never have I felt more confident in using that word.<p>The reason why Haskell is little-used in industry is because it's little-used in industry.  People join a team and use whatever language the app is written in.  When they decide to write something unrelated, they say, ""well, I have this whole team that knows Foo, and I'm really good at Foo, so I'll use Foo"".  Eventually someone introduces a new technology, and then people start feeling that way about the new technology.  Then they change jobs, and spread the feeling.  Before you know it, everyone is using Bar instead of Foo.  (Examples: Perl.  Java.  Perl supplemented and replaced C and Bash, and Java replaced C++.  Because some guy decided he wanted to.  Then they stuck.)<p>I use Haskell in industry.  Worry about what you want to do, rather than what everyone is doing.<p>(""But wait!"" you cry, ""How will I ever hire anyone to maintain this?""  Dunno.  My team can't find any C++ or Java developers, despite offering pretty interesting work and pay that's at the top of the industry.  There just aren't very many programmers -- hiring a programmer for any language is hard.)",1275445518

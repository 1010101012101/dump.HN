It also supports syntax highliting for most popular scripting languages (Ruby, Python, Perl, PHP, JavaScript and others) and has a great CSS editor AND integrated Terminal.<p>Plus you can choose to preview how your web app looks like in various browsers from Coda.<p>There are many more features, it's one very useful and slick app for web development work - HTML/CSS and lightweight scripting.<p>For heavier jobs (Lisp and non-web based Python programming) I use Aquamacs - definitely check it out.",1210982361

What do you want? What do you need? What service would add enough value to your startup that you would be willing to pay for it?<p>I also have a follow up question.  I am currently building a peer-to-peer microlending service targeted at startups.  I'm doing this because I noticed that many startups get their initial capital from credit card loans.  Would this be something that would help you?",1210982278

192299,comment,192058,192239,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I used TextMate for three months or so -- wanted to see what the fuss was about -- before gratefully switching back to emacs.<p>TextMate is the only editor I've used since learning emacs that I would even <i>consider</i> using full-time. (Except for vim, of course. :) It's a great product, and if you're happy with it you should keep using it. I'm not at all sad that I bought it -- there are tasks, mostly involving close integration with other Mac apps, that I still use it for.<p>But...<p>TextMate's snippets and completion were great for a while. Of course, I later discovered that the reason emacs didn't have these features is that I hadn't known that they were called ""abbrevs"" and ""dynamic abbrevs"". There's extensive documentation in emacs itself and on the emacswiki. So now my emacs has snippets, and various kinds of autocompletion.<p>In emacs, if you don't have exactly the right keyboard shortcut, you <i>fix</i> it. Here's one pet peeve of mine: Steve Yegge's essays have taught me to use isearch-forward and isearch-backward for navigation in long documents. In TextMate the backward search is bound to Control-Shift-S, a key combo that's torture to type compared to Control-R, that I can't <i>remember</i> to save my life, and that AFAIK cannot be changed (and it's not as if I didn't try). In emacs, where any key combo can be swapped for any other key combo in seconds, and <i>any</i> search command you hate has four built-in alternatives, twelve downloadable alternatives, and <i>all the source code available to be edited on the fly</i>, crap like this need not bother you for long.<p>I've got my emacs rigged so that, when I type source code, I don't need to press Shift to get symbols out of the top row of keys instead of digits. I type a lot more symbols than digits, so I use Shift when I need to type a digit. If I find myself typing a lot of digits, I press Ctrl-0 to toggle back to the normal behavior. You can't do this kind of stuff in a closed-source text editor.<p>And, mark my words, that's still the big problem with TextMate. I'm not generally a zealot about free software, but a text editor is the kind of tool you will be using for thirty years. It pays to invest in one that <i>you</i> will choose to abandon, and not the other way around. I'm inclined to use emacs instead of TextMate for the same reason that I'm inclined to play bridge instead of Magic: The Gathering: it has lasted for decades, it will last for decades more, I don't need to own special hardware or pay for any upgrades, and the whole thing belongs to me...<p>Plus, you get folks like Steve Yegge, working in his spare time to make your editor better. 10% of that guy's time is worth a fortune, and there's more where he came from! The problem with a closed-source editor is that there's only <i>one or two people</i> who can fix or improve the core code.",1210979465

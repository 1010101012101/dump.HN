2757700,comment,2755461,2756755,4,0,hristov,,,"Being a dork and a lawyer, I actually looked up the DHCP protocol. This is the relevant part:<p>""3.7 When clients should use DHCP<p><pre><code>   A client SHOULD use DHCP to reacquire or verify its IP address and
   network parameters whenever the local network parameters may have
   changed; e.g., at system boot time or after a disconnection from the
   local network, as the local network configuration may change without
   the client's or user's knowledge.

   If a client has knowledge of a previous network address and is unable
   to contact a local DHCP server, the client may continue to use the
   previous network address until the lease for that address expires.
   If the lease expires before the client can contact a DHCP server, the
   client must immediately discontinue use of the previous network
   address and may inform local users of the problem.""
</code></pre>
So no there is no indication in the protocol that the clients should assume that the DHCP server will keep its promises after a disconnection from the network. Furthermore, if you use common sense there is no reason to make this assumption in most real life situations. In a coffee house somebody can always trip over the router's cable, for example.",1310528986

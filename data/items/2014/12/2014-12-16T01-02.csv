There&#x27;s been quite a bit of progress since then ;)<p>For my work, I&#x27;m using a new reactive forcefield that&#x27;s based off of DFT calculations and has a very close energetic match with experiment.  Another forcefield I have used is optimized for structure and almost exactly reproduced neutron spectra for a variety of hierarchical materials, including long-range order (and that was from model systems alone).<p>Also, QM-MM methods have recently become more popular with additional computational power, so the parts that have significant non-classical effects can be computed correctly without wasting computational power on the parts that aren&#x27;t going to make a difference.<p>As with any tool, molecular dynamics works very well if you know the theory behind it and know what you can and can&#x27;t use it for.

The last thing you want is for any of those heat exchangers to break, as you are effectively mixing the components of rocket fuel.<p>The main reason though seems to be the temperatures involved. They are exposing hot air to near liquid helium (thanks to being cooled the the liquid hydrogen), thus cooling the air before it reaches the compressor etc that will make it suitable for the rocket engine proper.<p>At the same time they seem to be heating the hydrogen up. Easier to ignite a gas, or something close to it, than liquid. Just look at how your typical car engine works (never mind a fuel air explosive).",1418694571

My point is that having an opinion either way implies knowing the ROI is greater/less than some cutoff.<p>>And insufficient against what measure?<p>According to economic theory, the measure is the ROI of the next best project.  But even if you don&#x27;t subscribe to this theory, I imagine most people implicitly judge projects by some criterion that can be expressed as a cutoff of ROI.  E.g. most people don&#x27;t believe we should be building an interstellar spaceship right now, because the ROI on such a venture would be too low.<p>>Postulation, iteration and testing, re-iteration, re-testing...<p>A bit confused here.  From what I can see, exploration with robots is the path of iteration, while sending humans is the grand scheme.  Do you see things differently?  For example, there have been four successful Mars rovers starting in 1997.  Each one has been incrementally bigger and better.  Furthermore, improvements in computer and robotics hardware will happen regardless of investment by space exploration (I&#x27;m assuming improvements in the Mars rovers largely piggypacked on existing robotics technology, experts feel free to correct me), while improvements in human space travel will require specific investment in these technologies.",1418694430

Video on how to use a wire nut [3]; people mess these up all the time. For the mains voltage I recommend using at least solid THHN 14 AWG wire, it&#x27;s the minimum required wire size for a 15 amp circuit (Most outlets are rated for 15 or 20 amps); color coded as well, white for neutral & black/red for your hot, green for ground. If you&#x27;re unsure what one is hot, compare the voltage to the ground. A good clean design should not require electrical tape for it to be safe if you take the cover off.<p>Having a physical barrier between your low and high voltage areas is a must; the low voltage wire used to switch the relay is the only thing that should go inside the high voltage area (drill a small hole just for this wire & keep it away from 120v as much as possible), also mount the plug for your 5 volt source on this internal wall; or better yet use a USB outlet [4] as these are designed to be ran inside an enclosure. Using color coded wire for the low voltage is advised as well.<p>Since you&#x27;re dealing with water, making this device GFCI protected would be smart. Have your mains run through this first before anything else [5]. And finally for the relay get one that is UL listed & opto-isolated in order to prevent bad things from potentially happening; the RIBTE01B [6] will most likely fit the bill. Be sure to check the ratings for your relays; putting more power through them than they are designed for might end up with your project in flames.

8755451,comment,8748915,8749861,0,0,jblad,,,"If a curriculum, like KA, is &quot;aligned&quot; to a set of standards, like the Common Core standards, it means that the standards accurately describe what the curriculum teaches.  Often, as is the case with the Common Core State Standards, the standards do not address how the items of a particular content standard is taught, preferring to leave such things up to the professional judgement of the curriculum designers.  So the Common Core doesn&#x27;t mandate a &quot;style, tone, or technique.&quot;  And defining &quot;alignment&quot; as talking about a topic at the same time as other teachers in a certain order is perfectly reasonable.  You can even assess a student on that topic any way you want.  But don&#x27;t forget that the ways we assess students also teach them what we care about and what &quot;doing mathematics&quot; means.<p>One thing that is a big change from most states&#x27; previous standard, is that the Common Core includes 8 Mathematical Practice standards--ways that we want students to think about and do mathematics.  These are things like: don&#x27;t give up when solving problems, know and use the right mathematical tools for the right job, be precise, make and critique arguments, and pay attention to patterns.  As with everything we learn, students learn to engage in these behaviors by practicing them, and they get practice by engaging in tasks and interactions that require them to draw conclusions, cite evidence, and apply concepts to solve non-routine problems.  In a traditional classroom, these standards of mathematical practices should be woven in with all of the lessons that we teach, and we should assess students on their learning on these standards as well as the content standards.<p>While the Common Core might facilitate an expansion of standardized testing by giving a common set of expectations to assess, many people erroneously conflate the standards with the assessment of the standards.  This is understandable --Meyer does not seem to spend any time on drawing the distinction. The CCSS doesn&#x27;t mandate or recommend any particular test.  And while it makes sense to speak of assessment of the Common Core, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to speak of the Common Core assessment.<p>Having said that, any tool that claims to assess the Common Core should also assess these mathematical practices.  One such tool is the Smarter Balance Assessment Consortium&#x27;s test.  Meyer claims that KA doesn&#x27;t prepare students to be successful on the SBAC test, because students spend most of their interactions with Kahn Academy doing exercises and problems that do not require the depth that the Common Core calls for.  This assertion seems supported by his data.<p>You may be right that KA represents the current local maximum for computerized delivery of mathematics, but Meyer is evaluating KA as a curriculum, not as a resource for kids who need extra help.  In this role, Meyer&#x27;s data indicates that KA&#x27;s interactions with students falls short of depth of knowledge required by other assessments of the Common Core.  His hypothesis that KA focuses on these types of questions because they are easier to be scored by a computer seems pretty reasonable to me.  I don&#x27;t think it is trash talking KA to evaluate the product it delivers against the claims they make for that product.<p>Finally, suppose KA found a great way to have students engage in higher order thinking skills: maybe require students to explain their thinking or make conjectures or solve multi-step problems that require them to apply concepts in non-standard ways.  I don&#x27;t think this would make it useless for kids who use it for extra help, do you?",1418692924

8755423,comment,8755079,8755377,0,0,pm90,,,"This is a great question, actually. And this is perhaps a completely anecdotal answer, apologies for that. But I&#x27;ve personally found that if I can&#x27;t solve a problem in an hour, I&#x27;m just so frustrated that I stop, get up and do something else for a while. When doing the other activities, I&#x27;m still thinking of the problem, although obliquely. Often, new avenues of approach will present themselves via internal dialogue. This way, I&#x27;m thinking of the problem, even though I&#x27;m doing other &quot;useful&quot; stuff, and my value system is more comfortable with it, because I&#x27;m not &quot;wasting&quot; more time on the problem.<p>Like I said, this is completely anecdotal. But I read that Richard Hamming had the same thing to say about it, kind of,<p><a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html</a>:<p><i>Now again, emotional commitment is not enough. It is a necessary condition apparently. And I think I can tell you the reason why. Everybody who has studied creativity is driven finally to saying, ``creativity comes out of your subconscious.&#x27;&#x27; Somehow, suddenly, there it is. It just appears. Well, we know very little about the subconscious; but one thing you are pretty well aware of is that your dreams also come out of your subconscious. And you&#x27;re aware your dreams are, to a fair extent, a reworking of the experiences of the day. If you are deeply immersed and committed to a topic, day after day after day, your subconscious has nothing to do but work on your problem. And so you wake up one morning, or on some afternoon, and there&#x27;s the answer. For those who don&#x27;t get committed to their current problem, the subconscious goofs off on other things and doesn&#x27;t produce the big result. So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don&#x27;t let anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your thoughts on the problem. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.</i>",1418692020

In writing httpdito, and in particular in putting a sort of tiny peephole optimizer into it as gas macros, it occurred to me that (some) Forth systems are awfully close to being macro assemblers, and that really the only reason you’d use a higher-level language rather than a macro assembler is that error handling in macro assemblers, and in Forth, is terrible verging on nonexistent. Dynamically-typed languages give you high assurance that your program won’t crash (writing the Ur-Scheme compiler very rarely required me to debug generated machine code), while strongly-statically-typed languages give you similarly weak assurances with compile-time checks; but it seems clear that the programmer needs to be able to verify that their program is also free of bugs like memory leaks, infinite loops, SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF, or for that matter “billion-laughs”-like denial-of-service vulnerabilities, let alone more prosaic problems like the Flexcoin bankruptcy due to using a non-transactional data store.<p>Against this background, we find that a huge fraction of our day-to-day software (X11, Firefox, Emacs, Apache, the kernel, and notoriously OpenSSL) is written in languages like C and C++ that lack even these rudimentary memory-safety properties, let alone safety against the trickier bogeymen mentioned above. The benefit of C++ is that it allows us to factor considerations like XSS and loops into finite, checkable modules; the benefit of C is that we can tell pretty much what the machine is going to do. But, as compiler optimizations exploit increasingly recondite properties of the programming language definition, we find ourselves having to program as if the compiler were our ex-wife’s or ex-husband’s divorce lawyer, lest it introduce security bugs into our kernels, as happened with FreeBSD a couple of years back with a function erroneously annotated as noreturn, and as is happening now with bounds checks depending on signed overflow behavior.<p>We could characterize the first of these two approaches as “performing on the trapeze with a net”: successful execution is pleasant, if unexpected, but we expect that even a failure will not crash our program with a segfault — bankrupt Flexcoin, perhaps, and permit CSRF and XSS, but at least we don’t have to debug a core dump! The second approach involves performing without a net, and so the tricks attempted are necessarily less ambitious; we rely on compiler warnings and errors, careful program inspection, and testing to uncover any defects, with results such as Heartbleed, the Toyota accelerator failure, the THERAC-25 fatalities, the destruction of Ariane 5, and the Mars Pathfinder priority-inversion lockups.<p>So onto this dismal scene sweep Kennedy, Benton, Jensen, and Dagand, with a novel new approach: rather than merely factoring our loops and HTML-escaping into algorithm templates and type conversion operators, thus giving us the opportunity to get them right once and for all (but no way to tell if we have done so), we can instead program in a language rich enough to express our correctness constraints, our compiler optimizations (§4.1), and the proofs of correctness of those optimizations. Instead of merely packaging up algorithms (which we believe to be correct after careful inspection) into libraries, we can package up correctness criteria and proof tactics into libraries.<p>This is a really interesting and novel alternative to the with-a-net and the without-a-net approaches described earlier; it goes far beyond previous efforts to prove programs correct; rather than attempting to prove your program correct before you compile it, or looking for bugs in the object code emitted, it attempts, Forth-like, to replace the ecosystem of compilers and interpreters with a set of libraries for your proof assistant — libraries which could eventually allow you to program at as high a level as you wish, but grounded in machine code and machine-checkable proofs. Will it turn out to be practical? I don’t know.<p>(End quote from lobste.rs comment.)<p>Also, WHAT IN THE LIVING FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE THAT THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS PAPER IS ABOUT WHETHER YOU LIKE COCK.

And the layout is SOOO inefficient !\nBut the problem is even greater, you can&#x27;t merge Android and iOS layout passes.\nOn one platform, measuring is really fast and the other really slow ...\nXamarin forms can&#x27;t compensate and give native performance to this.\nThey don&#x27;t even have listview recycling ...\nOne developer even said &quot;RelativeLayout is probably best for you here and can do this&quot; to the question what the fastest layout is.\nFor Android, this is the WORST layout possible.<p>Anyway, you will spend a LOT of time fixing Xamarin bugs and developer their controls.<p>However, I LOVED .net functions, especially LINQ !<p>Anyway, development was really slow and performance is no were near to native.<p>So if you want to deliver a simple app to a client and be cross platform, then sure.

9321970,comment,9321209,9321724,0,0,patcheudor,,,"I&#x27;d say this one falls into the &quot;sort of&quot; category.  In web security we are constantly fighting cross site request forgery (CSRF) bugs.  Basically a bad actor places a GET or POST request into a page you visit which makes a request to another asset you are likely to have visited while authenticated like Facebook.  This GET or POST then leads to some action on your behalf without your knowledge leading to an action of consequence such as making a wall post on your behalf.  Similarly, within the context of this solution a bad actor could embed links to objects they want you to cache without your knowledge by not rendering the objects in a visible manner in the DOM.  Yes, this can happen today and yes, the technique could be used to frame someone.  In fact there was presumably once a court case where the defense team claimed their defendant didn&#x27;t browse child porn and to provide the judge an example that it&#x27;s possible to have child porn on a machine without ever knowingly visiting such content they had the judge browse the defense team website where they loaded up a bunch of images which went into his browser cache but which he didn&#x27;t see because they weren&#x27;t visible in the DOM.  They then asked the forensics investigator to see if the judge had browsed the particular content and of course he came back that the judge did.<p>In the case of this solution, a bad actor could use unsuspecting visitors to a site or users of a rogue WiFi network to load up the particular bad content they want distributed.",1428177320

In order to use the model, you must know the rank of sick time of the employee, relative to all other employees. In order to calculate this, you have to have the raw sick time numbers. At which point, what’s the point in making a regression with it—just work with the raw sick times to begin with!<p>Wouldn&#x27;t sick time taken per year be a more interesting measure? Over time, wouldn&#x27;t you expect that an employee of 30 years would&#x27;ve taken more sick time than an employee of six months?

I didn&#x27;t say it was offensive to be reasonable with those you disagree with.<p>Now I can see, on closer reading, that you&#x27;re just extending what I said about finding a middle ground.  And it&#x27;s a good way to detect where a miscommunication is by saying what you think I meant (that is, you&#x27;re telling me how you received it).<p>But it causes a miscommunication in that I receive it as an uncharitable reading: the tone of &quot;I&#x27;m lightly incredulous that this is what you mean, please clarify&quot; becomes &quot;You believe something utterly and obviously ridiculous.&quot;<p>But that&#x27;s not really what this has been about.

You are trying to find middle ground, it&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s middle ground you&#x27;re beginning with conditions favorable to you.<p>And more importantly it&#x27;s a bit absurd to ask him to move to a discussion on basic ethics terms.

Maybe today that reacted badly with a gruff and grumbling persona; maybe in communicating with friends you can successfully get people to sit down with introspective and meditative discussion questions like this one:<p>> I know I&#x27;ve made mistakes in the past. If I make a mistake in something I&#x27;ve said, does that exclude me from being able to learn from it?

In some sense, the conversation is <i>about</i> the right to write someone off.  It&#x27;s a right mreiland exercised gleefully in your case; perhaps even a touch too gleefully, but even that&#x27;s part of the point: it&#x27;s his right to do so if he chooses, because you can&#x27;t force him into a conversation.<p>There&#x27;s also a sense in which that was a necessary part of his strategy: refuse to muddle that point and stick solely to the right to discontinue conversation.  I don&#x27;t know how well he managed that in the end, but the main event is still: mreiland made a level-headed comment saying &quot;I&#x27;m inclined to write people off,&quot; and got written off by the community.",1428177182

9321931,comment,9321375,9321375,0,0,ics,,,"I used to be able to remember most of what I read verbatim without any effort. These days, the harder I try to filter and remember selectively, the worse my memory gets. What started as a mild compulsion has since become very useful– taking brief notes as I go on a blank 4x6 notecard. I have stacks and stacks of them, and every book I start gets a fresh one. Annotating books in the margins can help you get <i>into</i> it more, but it makes going back much harder (might as well re-read the book) and pains anyone who likes to keep their pages scrupulously clean. My &quot;system&quot; is not very strict but mostly follows these ideas:<p><pre><code>    - Every note begins with a page number unless the same as the previous note\n    - Notes are separated by a /\n    - Underline names/places/any *thing* to look up later\n    - Mark very important notes with a star or border\n    - Copying chapter titles sometimes helps\n    - Copy quotes, quick references (to other works), typos\n      (not really necessary, but &quot;Statute of Liberty&quot;...), or\n      thoughts & tangents. Typically I just write down a few\n      words here and there and then write about them\n      elsewhere (on the computer or in my notebook)\n    - At the very end, include a brief summary of what I felt\n      like or knew about before reading, while reading, and\n      after reading. I only find this useful for bios,\n      letters, theses, and that sort of thing.\n</code></pre>\nI can: re-read my notes and it will come back, skim notes to narrow down a page range for a detail that I&#x27;m looking for, scan the notecards for reference anywhere, keep my notes for library books, etc. That being said, I don&#x27;t really recommend it to people. If you write slowly, large, or don&#x27;t like keeping a pen/pencil on hand then it can be annoying.<p>Aside: I&#x27;ve considered automatically putting these notes into Anki after OCR (the one shown is a messy example, it seems to work though) but I think that&#x27;s touching a matter apart from the top poster&#x27;s intention. Rote memorization is useful, but the simple act of writing stuff down by hand has its own benefits without requiring much involvement.<p>Another thing to point out is that <i>what</i> you read is just as important. The reason I care about extracting references to other works, even if I can&#x27;t read them immediately, is because it cements a topic in your mind rather than just being another cloud of words and hazy memories. Today I read <i>Species of Spaces</i> (Georges Perec) and on one page he references Forbidden Planet because of the large triangular doors. I made a note of it since I don&#x27;t actually know what he&#x27;s talking about (born in the &#x27;90s, didn&#x27;t have TV, didn&#x27;t see Forbidden Planet, don&#x27;t blame me). Mentioning it here might actually be enough to make it stick, but I still intend to either read up on the film or, if I have the time, watch it (but not just for that scene!).<p>Example: <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28629850/Condit%2C%20Carl%20W.%20-%20American%20Building%20%281%29.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28629850/Condit%2C%20Car...</a> (side 1 of 2)",1428176587

I have been developing native apps with Xamarin for nearly 4 years now across iOS, Android, and of course Windows (I was a customer for 2 years before joining Xamarin). I just wanted to clarify a bit about Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms. It is important to know that Xamarin.Forms is a cross platform UI layer that sits on top of the core Xamarin platform. Using native Xamarin you are still sharing your backend C#/.NET code and then building out native user interfaces for each platform.<p>The Xamarin.Forms library adds an abstraction over common controls available on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. Xamarin.Forms is extremely extensible, but it is not for every app, especially if you need a lot of custom UI or API access. For data entry, proofs-of-concept, or other simple apps it is great and we have a guide to help you select: <a href=""http://cdn1.xamarin.com/Architecture%20Selector.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn1.xamarin.com/Architecture%20Selector.pdf</a>. The nice thing here is that either approach can use a shared-code backend.<p>I think I can address some of your concerns below:<p>1.) I would love to know which components you were having issues with and I can work with the team. There are a lot of settings in Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio as far as when to break on exceptions so I would love to help out here.<p>2.) If you are exclusive to using Xamarin.Forms then yes you will have a limited set of controls, since Xamarin.Forms is a subset of common controls. It is extensible via “CustomRenderers”, but that require some work and if you need a lot of them then it might be worth looking into the native approach without Xamarin.Forms as this approach will automatically give you access to every control on each platform you are creating.<p>3.) We are always looking to expand our documentation across all of our products and highly recommend checking out our updated developer portal: <a href=""http://developer.xamarin.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.xamarin.com</a> there is a plethora of Xamarin.Forms related documentation as well as <a href=""http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-f...</a> It is pretty extensive, but if there is something missing please please please let us know and we will work with the documentation team to add it.

In turn that makes it more likely that all ravens are a single color. 100 ravens are less likely to all be the same color than 5 ravens. (In the limit, if no ravens exist than all ravens are black, and purple, and polka-dotted).<p>So under those conditions, it is true that observing a white cat should slightly increase your belief that all ravens are black, but it should also increase your belief that all ravens are purple, and even that all ravens are white. That&#x27;s entirely because the non-raven reduces the expected number of ravens, thereby increasing the probability that all ravens are a single color.<p>On the other hand, if you already know how many ravens exist, then observing a non-raven tells you nothing about the color of ravens, and your prior for &quot;all ravens are black&quot; should be unchanged.",1428175511

9321871,comment,9320601,9320733,0,0,dalke,,,"To understand why, I&#x27;ll start with a quote from the Wikipedia page for &quot;Big Data&quot;:<p>> Big data is a broad term for data sets so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate. Challenges include analysis, capture, curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and information privacy. The term often refers simply to the use of predictive analytics or other certain advanced methods to extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set.<p>See the last term? That&#x27;s the meaning used in this article. You can see that in &quot;Mistake #1&quot; when it mentions Python Pandas. That expects that data can fit into RAM. You can see more of it in &quot;10s of gigabytes of data, the power of a scripting languange [sic] like Python, no matter how optimized, may not be enough&quot; -- I used Python to process 10s of GB of data, and renting a 60 GiB machine from Amazon costs $1.680/hour.<p>If you believe that it&#x27;s not &quot;Big Data&quot; unless you need a cluster of machines to have enough RAM to work with it, then I can well understand why you might complain about Python in this context.<p>On the flip side, I&#x27;ve seen, or heard of, &quot;Big Data&quot; projects which start with the expectation that it will require a cluster, and never investigate if &#x27;traditional data processing applications&#x27; are adequate. Eg, in one project I developed optimizations that gave an overall 40x performance boost, so that one machine was needed when previously my client required a cluster.<p>If Big Data includes using machine learning to identify patterns in data sets too large to understand by people, then we were using Python to do data mining of large chemical screening data in the late 1990s. Even earlier, Python was being used to control supercomputing tasks, where the high-level glue code was in Python and the low-level code in C or Fortran.<p>Unlike simple map-reduce jobs, these included codes with complex inter-node dependencies, like molecular dynamics, where the network bandwidth is another important performance factor. A molecular dynamics simulation can product 10s of GB per day, so can easily count as &quot;Big Data&quot; projects which cannot be done using the JVM-based solutions you mentioned.<p><a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/01/bigdata-languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/01/bigdata-languages</a> also gives a viewpoint on the lack of importance of the specific language on big data analysis.",1428175353

I never really &quot;got&quot; them until I did that, I was always much more aligned with you.<p>As for photo realism, have you seen the movie &quot;Tim&#x27;s Vermeer&quot;? It&#x27;s a great look at a possible technique for that and the movie is very interesting.",1428174386

A reduction in empathy makes it easier to risk the lives of the people you intend to ignore or protect. This is the same reason people are so mean to each other on the Internet.</i><p>I agree, but also think it&#x27;s kind of a double-edged sword in a way, because the internet also brings distant people more together. This is nothing new of course, movies and TV were closing distant gaps long before it: ignoring the valid criticisms of Live Aid for a second, people got motivated to do something because they empathised with distant people thanks to this <i>tele</i>-vision.<p>Similarly the internet has been a boon for niche interest communities that would have either never gotten off the ground, or in the case of older traditions died out if the enthusiasts wouldn&#x27;t have been able to find distant people with similar interests online. The older mass-medias homogenized society because they were top-down, but I firmly believe the internet is our best technological bet for bringing back cultural diversity, paradoxically by connecting everyone globally.",1428174359

In that case, you can slide your desk back to the door wall with monitor backs facing the window so that you can see people coming in on your side. For coders, I think being along the window wall makes the most sense as visitors are not a big part of coding (hopefully) ",1194803410

There are only so many reasonable tempos, only so many keys to play in (and popular music sticks to a very small subset of available scales, and even if they didn't, all modern instruments are equal tempered and so only have 12 notes that are identical across all instruments and keys...and many scales can overlap without horrendous results).  And, obviously, the same song is going to be in the same tempo and key (roughly)...so you can easily delay some number of beats and get a round out of it.<p>Try it with just about any song.  It'll work fine.  Obviously, instrumentals will usually work better, but even vocal tracks can work fine this way.",1194802756

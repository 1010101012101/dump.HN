And I agree that a decent person <i>shouldn't</i> write that sort of thing.<p>But, there is a world of difference between what I morally shouldn't do, and what I legally can't do.<p>I think the Ku Klux Klan is horrible for spouting its bigoted hate speach about minorities - but I don't think we should make it illegal for them to do so.<p>I (and the law) are in agreement that straight up libel, slander, obscenity, and calls to violence are not protected by free speech, but pretty much everything else is.<p>By definition, an opinion can't be false (it's my opinion) - and you really don't want a court legislating which opinions someone should be allowed to express. You can be sued for outright lying (slander/libel), but you can not (and should not) be sued for stating an opinion. No matter how ill conceived or malicious that opinion is.",1234994083

486287,comment,486124,486257,0,0,boulderdash,,,"Hi - text ads are about end user conversion. Otherwise it is just click fraud. People clicking have to buy something in the end. I have a hard time believing that IRC channels have a good enough conversion to pay for bandwidth and salaries.<p>I'm seeing that this is a longer conversation, but consider this simple example. Facebook ad rates have dropped significantly from their early days. When people are communicating in an application (which is all Facebook really is), they are not in the mood to buy/convert. So, if you are receiving income, great, but I doubt it will be sustainable. Take a look at the ads you get and see if you get re-buys.<p>Anyways, please don't take this as harsh.

He really is very good at devising menus that do just that and promoting them (though arguably his celebrity status helps a little there).

However, in contrast to the way it's always presented, the basic proof is simple and generated by humans in a way that computers can't yet do.<p>It's like using advanced techniques to prove that all even numbers from 10^100 onwards are the sum of two primes, then using computers to check everything up to 10^100, and thus claiming a proof of the Goldbach conjecture.

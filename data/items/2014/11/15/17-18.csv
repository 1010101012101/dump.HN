8612175,comment,8611250,8612027,0,0,personlurking,,,"That&#x27;s definitely a good question, and a hard one. No one there due to having a low socio-economic status wants to live there but they can&#x27;t afford other places that would give them the same access to work (and even leisure). Location-wise, it&#x27;s extremely practical to live in a favela (and it&#x27;s interesting that in California, for example, the rich people generally live on the hills, whereas that&#x27;s not the case in Rio).<p>There are several prime cases of favela removal in Rio (Pinto, Catacumba, Esqueleto) in and around the 1960s and 70s. The residents were removed to City of God, and some run-down areas near the international airport (Complexo do Maré, etc). Also, in the first few years of the 20th century, there was a large mandate to destroy and remove favelas in downtown Rio (called the &quot;bota-abaixo&quot;) which did beautify these areas, allowed for sanitary services to be installed, etc. Most of these residents just moved to other places like Rocinha and Vidigal on the other side of the city. So, even if they&#x27;re &quot;removed&quot;, they end up equally poor in a less desirable (to them) location in the same city.<p>At this point, as it has been for a long time, favelas are just part of Brazilian life and they&#x27;ve grown to have their own culture, social norms, vocabulary, etc. So, if favelas are to be done away with, it will have to be done with sufficient resources, extreme care and to the liking (can&#x27;t think of a better word) of the residents themselves.<p>While they live in favelas, they want dignity, respect, and access to basic services (ex, Rocinha has an open sewer at the bottom of the hill). So these things will have to exist where they end up living, and during the transfer process.",1416074084

8612170,comment,8608891,8608891,0,0,bigtunacan,,,"I currently live in Cedar Rapids, which is largely referred to as the &quot;corridor&quot; area; the region joining the &quot;separate&quot; cities of Iowa City, Coralville, Cedar Rapids, Marion, Hiawatha which are all sort of converging into one larger metro area as population and grow increases.  We are about a 2 hour drive from Des Moines and there is a lot of collaboration happening across the state outside of just Des Moines.<p>There is huge growth happening in the tech sector within Iowa, but also in other areas, education, medical, insurance, agri-business, being a few of the key areas.<p>I&#x27;ve seen mention on here already of RAGBRAI and the bike friendliness of Des Moines; this is more true in the Iowa City/Coralville areas, and equally true in the main Cedar Rapids districts.<p>Here are some things that are more interesting though; the midwest has some of the lowest in the nation, and Iowa sits at an average unemployment rate of 4.5%.  In terms of diversity; it may not have been that diverse 20 years ago, but these days Iowa is ranked as the 3rd most progressive state, right behind Massachusetts and California.<p>We have huge incentives for technology, start-up accelerators, local tech conferences, low cost of living, local re-investment. Personally, I hate the &quot;Silicon Prairie&quot; term, because it means that people turn it into a us vs them sort of comparison.  In terms of raw numbers, more successful start-ups are going to come out of California; or I would certainly hope so since the population of the state is in excess of 38M whereas as Iowa is just barely over 3M.  However in terms of your chances of success; these days I think the odds are probably in your favor in Iowa.<p>I&#x27;m just some dude, and I&#x27;ve had beers, dinner, or just visited with CEOs of many of the tech businesses (long established & start-ups) and the thing is these are great people.  They still relate to their humble beginnings and they want to give back and grow business right here.  They are so approachable, and I think this is in large part due to the fact that the lines aren&#x27;t as long because we are still small.<p>Right now I seriously have to give a shout-out to Eric Engelmann, founder of the Iowa Startup Accelerator and the CEO of Geonetric.  He is an all around great guy, who has done so much for this area and continues to do so, and there are too many more around here to name.<p>Is it Hipster? Some yes, some no. Is it a great place to be right now? Unequivocally; Yes. But you don&#x27;t have to join us; we&#x27;ll continue to do just fine on our own.

8612164,comment,8611198,8611979,0,0,uxp,,,"Lets go back and look at the history of human knowledge about comets for a moment.<p>1) The composition of comets were largely unknown until ~1950 when Fred Whipple hypothesized that they were largely icy objects instead of rocky objects, which was only confirmed in 1986 when Vega 1 and 2 flew by Halley&#x27;s comet.<p>2) This idea was flipped in 2001 when Deep Space 1 took photos of the comet Borrelly, which showed a hot and dark surface.<p>3) The Stardust mission in 2004 discovered that the dust of a comet was actually a crystalline structure, created by very high temperatures.<p>4) The Deep Impact probe in 2005 was the first physical contact humans had with a comet&#x27;s surface, which resulted in us combining the two previous hypotheses into an object filled with an icy dust mixture protected by a hard and hot dirt shell.<p>5) Finally this year we landed Philae onto a comet&#x27;s surface by launching a probe in 2004, a mission that started as far back as 1992.<p>This means that we were planning on landing an object onto the surface of a comet long before we knew what in the hell a comet really was. To say that we failed to meet the goal of a one week operational timeframe on the surface disregards the entirety of knowledge learned during the operation of the mission in which we were conducting. Just after Rosetta launched we figured out that the surface of a comet was probably more ice than rock, and had to conduct retroactive experiments in order to determine whether or not the harpoons of which had already been engineered, designed, manufactured and launched into space (which failed to work, so the result is somewhat moot anyways) would in fact be capable of holding the lander on the surface of the comet. The main goal of this mission was to learn more about comets, not spend a defined time on the surface like a game of &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; at some elementary school playground. The mission was successful. We obtained data about the surface of comets and discoveries and observations resulting from the collection of this data will continue to happen over many years to come. Would have it been better if we were able to keep a probe operational on the surface of the comet for years instead of weeks, or weeks instead of days? Yes. But the goal was to learn shit, not get in a pissing contest with a nonexistent alternative lifeform that has already landed an object on a comet and kept it alive longer than us.",1416073732
8612163,comment,8608891,8612024,0,0,briandear,,,"&quot;Bring in seasoned talent..&quot; All seasoned talent needs is an Internet connection. A successful company doesn&#x27;t require a ping pong table. Basecamp makes more money each year than most startups ever will and they&#x27;re entirely remote. I love in the south of France and work just fine without having to go to company HQ in New York. The only folks working in the office are just the sales guys and even they could do their work just fine from home if they were so inclined. Location is only relevant if you need an address to impress a particularly unelightened investor. The myth that the talent is only in San Fran or NYC is getting played out. I have several devs that work for me that live in Portland, Jacksonville, Atlanta, Belgrade-- folks all over the place and they&#x27;re &quot;top tier&quot; talent. In fact I would argue that it&#x27;s harder to recruit talent in NYC and San Fran.. Real wages are comparatively lower than pretty much anywhere else in the country and you&#x27;re competing against places like Google, Twitter, Apple. Why would a Dev come work for your (figuratively) rinky-dink startup for likely less money and likely worthless equity (statistically speaking) when they could walk down the street and work for any number of successful companies? However if I lived in a place like Grand Rapids, your startup might be an attractive choice.. And it would even save you money: you can pay the same salary but you&#x27;d pay less for their health insurance and you could save on the extra office space. You could also save on the silliness like a &quot;beer fridge&quot; or whatever else is the latest trend in an attempt to be a great place to work.<p>My criteria for a great place to work: competent product managers, an interesting product, a good salary, equity that isn&#x27;t insulting, proper vacation time and other folks working with me that value high quality code. That&#x27;s pretty much it. Your awesome office space is a waste of money and doesn&#x27;t attract &quot;good&quot; developers -- a good dev is not going to sign up with you because of office space; those other elements must be there. Anyone that places a value of the office space over the value of those other things is an idiot. When I did work in an office in New York, I enjoyed my time the most with a company that had no windows, was in a cramped, shared space with barely enough room for a laptop, let alone a massive desk for my 27&quot; monitor much more than the hip place with great coffee, a ping ping table and catered lunches because of the work we were doing and the people I had to work with.<p>Talent should be location irrelevant for an Internet company. Actually, unless you have a warehouse or must meet customers in person or sell retail (or build a physical product,) the entire concept of an &quot;office&quot; is about as relevant as a VCR.",1416073663

I wiped away the excess oil, and that was it. No oven-baked seasoning process.<p>To clean after cooking, I usually just wipe it out. Every now and then I do a more thorough cleaning, essentially repeating what I did when I first bought it. Wash with soap, scraping with a spatula to get stuck bits off.

I think he&#x27;s trying to understand why, for example, Geri&#x27;s head doesn&#x27;t turn into a sphere.<p>DeRose doesn&#x27;t say so explicitly, but the reason is that the position of any given point on the infinitely subdivided surface is only determined by the positions of a handful of points in the control mesh.  That&#x27;s why, for example, the derivation for the final position of B given at the end of the video only depends on its neighbors A and C, and not any other points.<p>Thus, if you want more control over a portion of a subdivision surface, you can just use a denser control mesh in that portion of the model.  You can create arbitrarily hard edges by moving control vertices closer together.  At a microscopic scale, the edge is still smooth and blobby, but it looks sharp at a distance.<p>You can also make creases in subdivision surfaces by using different subdivision weights over the surface of the model, which may be what DeRose is getting at when he answers with &quot;magic numbers&quot;.  But it&#x27;s my understanding that most modern CG is done using subdivision with the standard Catmull-Clark weights over the entire model, instead relying on the density of the input mesh to specify detail.",1416073150

In the old days, there was a single lock around the allocator serializing malloc/free. These days, all the major platforms have a memory allocator that tolerates some degree of concurrency, and you can also link in tcmalloc or jemalloc. Even then, a lot will depend on your allocation patterns. For example, many threaded malloc implementations depend on thread-local caches to avoid having to take a lock on the fast path. This works great for many workloads, but can also fall flat on others. Consider what happens when a producer thread allocates memory, passes a pointer to a consumer thread which frees it. The thread-local cache in the producer thread will never be replenished by free() calls, and the thread-local cache in the consumer thread will never be used by malloc() calls. Thus performance can become very dependent on the mechanism the allocator uses to transfer memory to/from the local caches and the global heap.",1416072328

I remember building Xorg overnight once on Gentoo only to discover that it had failed about 30 minutes <i>after</i> I went to bed.<p>I&#x27;m still a little upset over that, thinking back on it.<p>> (Don&#x27;t know enough about Arch to comment on it.) On the whole pkg is pretty painless.<p>Arch is a rolling release distribution with binary packages; it seems that pkg operates in a manner similar (identical?) to this. It really is the best of both worlds: New packages, when updates are released upstream--usually within days--without the need to compile.<p>Though, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Arch for much other than a workstation (partially due to the nature of rolling releases--breakage happens), it has actually been a fantastic distro for someone whose <i>nix history went something like OpenBSD -> FreeBSD -> Gentoo. You update the system periodically, new packages are downloaded and installed, and updates occur frequently. Compilation is mostly limited to the AUR (Arch User Repository), but the benefit with Arch is that its build tools create binary packages by default that you can then use on other machines of the same architecture. Gentoo allows the same thing, but IIRC it&#x27;s not something it&#x27;ll do by default and it&#x27;s a bit fussier. If you do have to build something, Arch will build the package first, then install from that. But the main repositories have essentially everything you&#x27;d want, so compilation truly is limited to less popular/common packages. Everything else is just a download + install away.<p>But again, Arch is susceptible to some breakage at times, although I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck avoiding this. I guess it&#x27;s like anything else: If you&#x27;re careful and apply some meticulous scrutiny to the process, you&#x27;re less likely to break things in a manner that&#x27;s difficult to fix. Updating regularly (as with other rolling releases, like Gentoo) is also helpful. Too long between updates can create a bit of a difficult situation to get out of.<p>> Yes and no. I installed openjdk 8.x the other day using &#x27;pkg search&#x27;, then &#x27;pkg install&#x27;. Quite simple. However, if for some reason the Oracle version is necessary, then you&#x27;d have the hassle of getting it from their site.<p>Okay, that&#x27;s not too bad. I </i>vaguely* recall it being painful back during 5.x-6.x, but I never had much need for Java on FreeBSD either outside some odds and ends.<p>> Maybe I should feel a little embarrassed that I still have one DB server which has been running FBSD 6.0 since 2005 (I think).<p>NOPE! (I wouldn&#x27;t.)<p>When I ran FreeBSD (all the way back through the latter 4.x days, probably 4.5-4.6 at the absolute earliest, but I think we had a 4.7/4.8 machine running for a number of years), the <i>beautiful</i> thing about it was <i>definitely</i> its stability. You could do exactly that: Go for ages without updating it and as long as it wasn&#x27;t Internet-connected, there wasn&#x27;t really much you needed to worry about. And even if it was, you could just update whatever software you had listening on open ports, within reason, and not worry (I&#x27;d do this with Apache or BIND). I know this goes counter to much of the philosophy here, but sometimes if it ain&#x27;t broke...<p>The curious thing regarding FreeBSD was the more conservative upgrade path you&#x27;d often feel compelled to take, and you seldom felt guilty for leaving a machine untouched. You could always take comfort in the fact that it&#x27;d Just Work and remain fairly secure.",1416071617

Anything you buy new from lodge today is going to have a texture like low grit sand paper. Any old Wagner or Griswold is going to have a much smoother base surface.<p>2) Make sure you get everything off your pan. If you did buy a new pan, they often have weird artificial seasoning on them. If you have an old pan, anything loose can provide a failure mode for your new nice coat of seasoning.<p>3) Don&#x27;t get 100% of the oil off between coats as the article suggests. You won&#x27;t build any seasoning.<p>4) Consider using Canola oil. The flaxseed oil that you buy seems to have some particulate matter that is noticeable in the finished seasoning. That or I didn&#x27;t shake mine enough.<p>5) Consider doing this at a time when you can open all the doors/windows. Even if you stick to the really thin layer, your house will still get a smelly smoke.<p>6) Don&#x27;t leave anything nice on the top of your stove. My oven vents out over the burners, and a Le Cruset pot resting there got covered in a sticky residue that was a pain to clean off.<p>More background:<p>I tried this with a beat up hand-me-down wagner about a year ago. I did six coats of flaxseed while following the instructions to &quot;get all the oil off&quot; with a towel after each application. The result was a pan with basically no seasoning that everything stuck to.<p>I went back and repeated while leaving a thicker layer (still not oil pooled or anything, but noticeably wet/shiny). This worked much better, and left a decent coat on the pan that things don&#x27;t stick to. Sadly I did not strip the pan back down after the first misadventure, and some of my nice seasoning is now peeling around the corners.",1416071557

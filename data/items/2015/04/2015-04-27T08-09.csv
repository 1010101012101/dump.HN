However it is <i>not</i> ok to force people to use something they question, or actually don&#x27;t want. By the way, systemd is not the only way to go. There are also runit and other systems.<p>I always follow the KISS principle because the more complicated a system gets the more difficult it is to be fixed.

You know how Swiss people are proud of their neutrality, Finnish school system is (one of) the best in the world, Englishmen love their queen, Greeks invented democracy and Italians are immune to Stendhal Syndrome? Well, none of those sentence makes any sense if you substitute the national adjective with &quot;European&quot;.<p>Europe being not a nation is not only a matter of traditions, but of everyday life as well. We don&#x27;t share a television system, which would be anyway complicated by the multitude of languages. We don&#x27;t follow political debates in other countries, and newspapers will report about foreign election only for a handful of states or when an extremist party wins. We have the football European Champions League final, but it&#x27;s nowhere like what I heard about the Super Bowl, with stars and celebrities, because we don&#x27;t share stars and celebrities.<p>Maybe this is just a case of &quot;far away, thus homogeneous&quot;. For example, some time ago I was talking about south-Asian cuisine, when suddenly I found myself wondering how I could talk about <i>a</i> south-Asian cuisine. Does <i>a</i> south-Asian cuisine even exist? What would I do if I traveled to China and entered a &quot;European&quot; restaurant serving both pizza and haggis?

It wouldn&#x27;t be hard to require it not to have cycles, but cyclic data is actually a major usecase for Rc.  A cycle collector wouldn&#x27;t fix any of the unsafety here unless it was run on literally every drop, which would be far too slow to be acceptable in a systems language.  An opt-in trait to prevent leaking specific types would be practical, but the implementation details aren&#x27;t settled and it can be done backwards-compatibly, so there&#x27;s a strong feeling that it shouldn&#x27;t block the release.

Like, pitch black wood. You need them close to each other and minimum 5 rows together if you want a self-sustaining hedge (and still the outer rows are doomed to die early). And I&#x27;m talking about heavily irrigated areas [1] next to the Argyle lake in the Northern Territory [2].<p>I guess not all places are like Australia, but those with desertification and ecosystem deprecation will require many trees at once. I wonder how they&#x27;ll deal with this minimum critical mass problem. Overall this startup idea is excellent, for example thick hedges for areas next to the Sahara can stop the desert from advancing and revive the whole area within the perimeter, by rehydrating the winds and restoring livable temperature.<p>[1] Heavily irriguated area above 38C all year long: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sandelholzplantagen_Kununurra.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sandelholzplantagen_Kununu...</a>

If there are known bad defaults in software as distributed, this should be fixed by the packagers for the distributions.<p>All talk of &quot;hardening&quot; and &quot;scanning&quot; is symptomatic of this faulty way of thinking.<p>However, I fear that these kinds of things will continue to exist, for one simple reason:  Running these programs and applying these fixes manually feels <i>useful</i> to the sysadmin.  It gives the sysadmin a little boost of self-esteem, merely for, essentially, <i>pushing a button</i>.

The more guarantees your database can deliver, the easier it is to reason about things and make sure you aren&#x27;t being caught on a gotcha.<p>It&#x27;s not necessarily different than using a normal RDBMS, right - you could do a check in SQL outside a transaction and end up writing multiple times. But with an RDBMS, you can easily solve the situation by turning on a transaction and leaving no question about things.<p>This is why things like VoltDB (&quot;NewSQL&quot;) are pushing to keep SQL and ACID, and figure out a way to scale, instead of throwing it all aside and making the developer deal with consistency issues.<p>It&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t end up with the same functionality using eventual consistency, just that it&#x27;s harder. Just look at Amazon&#x27;s &quot;apology based computing&quot; (I think that was the name) and how they structure their systems to be resilient by being able to resolve multiple conflicting commands in a proper way (deciding, without communication, which command wins, figuring out rollbacks, etc.) It&#x27;s fantastic, and perhaps it&#x27;s the only feasible way to operate at their scale. But it&#x27;s also a hell of a lot more complicated than &quot;UseTransaction = true&quot;.<p>(So my predictions/guesses: If developers that&#x27;d otherwise use a traditional ACID RDBMS switch to non-ACID (BASE?) systems, they&#x27;ll end up introducing bugs due to the shifted responsibility of handling data consistency. And seeing how big servers are, and even how far sharding can take you with normal RDBMS, the scale at which people &quot;need&quot; to drop ACID is probably far higher than the point at which people are dropping it.)",1430122170

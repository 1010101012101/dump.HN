The whole point of categorizing is that the categories should convey some information about the thing categorized. The point I'm making here is that these personality categories don't even come close to this. The problem is that personality is an extremely complicated concept, and one that is prone to constant change. I seriously doubt that you could say something meaningful about a subject's personality with 10 axes, let alone four.<p>To illustrate this, ask yourself two basic questions of these test results:<p><pre><code>    1) Are the conditions and results repeatable?\n    2) Can you use them to make any meaningful prediction of behavior?\n</code></pre>\nMy contention is that the answer to each is a resounding ""No"", and hence the results are essentially useless.",1258339875

That is, EC2 was 20% more expensive than operating ones own hardware in a South Bay datacenter for a year.<p>This would have been about a year ago, but, IIRC, <i>including</i> operating costs, one would break even at around 10 months of unreserved EC2. Pricing has certainly changed in the meantime, so 30% in the other direction is well within the realm of possibility.<p>Back then, it cost about $3 per year per watt. Now it's pushing $4. The trick is, in the case of ones own hardware, one usually pays for the available capacity, not just what one uses. On a 500W server, that's $2k annually.<p>That's the flexibility that AWS offers: one doesn't pay for the operating capacity, only the use. It would seem, however, that one pays for the hardware up front either way.<p>The great <i>increase</i> in flexibility of operating ones own hardware is not suffering from only ordering off an abbreviated menu. Germane to the OP's question, I have never found any virtual or dedicated server offerings come close (say, a factor of 10) to the I/O performance of something custom configured/assembled (even from inexpensive, commodity blocks). Whether this constitutes a <i>problem</i> is subject to interpretation<p>In general, I remain skeptical that there exists in The Cloud cheap-enough commodity servers suited to even a majority of applications.

That would be claiming that there are only 16 personalities in the world, which, as you note, is absurd.  It is merely an attempt to define a few of the dimensions that make up a human personality, and provide a framework for talking about how those different dimensions interact.<p>If you aren't interested in this, it's your business.  But you should really reflect on where the attitude of ""this is too nebulous and volatile"" a subject to study and try to quantify, and decide if that's really how you want to react to things that are too big and complex to be immediately understood.<p>If you really think the test is bullshit, then why am I, and  the vast majority of the respondents on the previous poll (linked above/below) NTs, also know as Rationals?

I had absolutely no problem paying for the beta - I've paid Microsoft and Apple for betas and they need the cash a lot less than these guys.<p>That said, I wouldn't quite recommend it if you're on the fence or just want a quick intro to Cappuccino. It <i>is</i> a beta -- there are a lot of polish issues with the cocoa app, there are some bugs, and these are understandable. But the biggest problem of all is the total dearth of documentation. There is a class guide, there are some non-Atlas tutorials, and that's about it. So, for instance, my app template comes up by default with a menubar, but there's no obvious way I can see to remove or edit it. MainMenu.cib has no menu in it, so I can't even see how to make connections to it and there's nothing to read to find out.<p>It's definitely impressive -- that they've done this in JS and running in a browser is a little marvel. However, I'm pretty used to Xcode and Interface Builder, and in comparison it's really not there. Trying to work with multiple embedded split-views really highlighted the differences: it's tricky enough in IB, and proved almost impossible here. That they've achieved so much does mean that you're into uncanny valley territory; if it looks like a cocoa app, I want it to work like one too.<p>However, the things I <i>could</i> figure out how to do, worked well. I defined outlets and actions, hooked them up, and was basically thinking and coding exactly as I would in Cocoa and Objective-C. Nifty.<p>It has got a fair way to go, but I think they well might get there. If you're already working with Cappuccino and don't need documentation, it could well be worth your time.",1258338616

Although I believe the example is specious[1], I found it to be valid in principle if offensive in attitude.<p>The principle which validity I praise is that there may be biological reasons for different aspects of maturation and that these may be several years apart in any given individual. That we may be able to detect this objectively is encouraging, as it may obviate the political answer to the OP's titular question.<p>The suggestion, however,  that rights are ""doled"" out is startling and offensive. I do hope the ""Nanny State"" hasn't become axiomatic. I would expect scientists to lean more toward a system based on a notion of natural rights, rather tha on legal technicalities, but I admit a tendency to project.<p>I do believe that our legal civil rights are merely an approximation of our natural rights. I also believe it's silly to make a knowningly inaccurate, inflexible approximation.<p>I would propose a variable-age system, perhaps an extension of current emancipated-minor procedures. The trick would be to test for maturity without erecting a procedural barrier, all while involving self-determination.<p>If Steinberg is right, then there could be several different components to majority, each with a different default age [2], or even the same default age, if majority could be had just for the asking for something like suffrage. Pairing rights with responsibilities might not be obvious, though only until the maximum default age.<p>Politically, I find the current situation inexcusable. Deciding, after the fact, that a child was an adult, for the purpose punishing a crime, is irresponsible, at best, on the part of adults. What happened to holding parents responsible? It seems to work for dogs and their owners.<p>[1] I don't believe there are laws against a 19 year old renting a car (statutory references to the contrary are welcome). It is, rather, a private company making an economic decision. ""Driving"" a tank has more involved prerequisites (training, basic and specialized) and supervision. Back when I was under 25 and traveled for business, I recall there were exceptions in the ""fine print"" on minimum age for drivers renting on official company business, a context closer to tank operation than a Spring Break rental.<p>[2] That this would still be a political approximation is less distressing, since its goal would be to ensure an age that is a high enoug percentile of maturation",1258337990

(Sometimes, though, you get an exception you can catch with try{}/catch{}, instead of an actual segv.  It would be hilarious... if only the app I was working on did not use this behavior as part of its string-parsing routine...)",1258337194

From the actual website:<p>""Atlas is a development tool for building Cappuccino applications.<p>In addition to managing your project files and editing code, it includes a powerful visual layout tool for designing your interfaces without ever having to touch code.<p>Designers are empowered to interact with their designs instantly, which means programmers get to finished applications faster.""",1258337105

943770,comment,943185,943580,0,0,jrockway,,,"I guess that is a Microsoft term, but basically, if you can't cast an integer to a pointer, you have managed code, and you have eliminated many classes of very severe security vulnerabilities.  (I assume, of course, that code like ""foo[42]"" is logically two unsafe typecasts; pointer to integer, some integer math, and then integer to pointer.  The third operation is the security problem.)<p>I don't think managed code is vulnerable to any additional types of exploits, other than holes in the runtime.  But remember, if there is a hole in the runtime, you patch the runtime and Every Program Ever Written gets that fix.  Everyone knows how to avoid buffer overflows in C, but sometime they mess something up and the app becomes vulnerable.  The only way to fix that is to find the problem in the app and fix it... and hope that you got all of them this time.<p>There are plenty of ways managed code can be insecure, of course.  I am trying to get root access on my Archos media player, and it is pretty easy because of their poor programming.  There is a bash script running as root that downloads a named file from the Internet and puts it in a directory.  Except oops, I control the Internet connection and the content that script downloads.  I also control the filesystem that it writes to.  So while I don't have root, I can get the system to overwrite any file I want, including /etc/shadow, and now I do have root.  (Except, the filesystem is read-only, so this doesn't actually work.  They got very very lucky.  But their code is horribly crappy C, so it should be easy to exploit when I feel like spending time on it.)",1258336915

943768,comment,943239,943239,0,0,Locke1689,,,"I think a problem this article doesn't touch on is the assumption that there is a baseline that every person will reach at some point. For example, we say that young people are less mature and should be limited in their privileges. This may be true individually, but it doesn't really speak to the idea that maybe someone who still has time to mature at 16 may be more mature than someone at 30 will ever be.<p>I'm not quite sure what the proper resolution is here. Because it is too difficult to measure each person individually it may be better to simply guarantee a certain age where someone is an ""adult.""<p>I find it very difficult to defend the law that prevents drinking until 21 but allows driving, which is subject to the same pressures and distractions as drinking (with the added consequence that driving can cause harm to others as well).",1258336821

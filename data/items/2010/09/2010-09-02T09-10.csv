It's handy and worth considering if it's something you want/need when buying a smartphone.<p>I also like the fact that Apple's anti-Flash stance has effectively ended the Flash Hegemony and you can't just assume it's there. If you're building interactive apps for a kids website you'll still use it, because there's nothing else comparable (yet), but if you're making an interactive graph or chart you'll at least investigate if SVG or Canvas could work just as well.<p>So Adobe loses out, because Flash isn't ubiquitous.
Also Apple loses out, because Flash isn't available on their devices.
Also Apple users lose out, because they can't access Flash content.<p>But overall the web wins, Apple and their users are taking one for the team and they have my thanks. If they could just stop denying reality on this (and various other issues) in their slightly scary, culty manner, I'd appreciate that too.",1283421332

1655713,comment,1655455,1655455,0,0,samratjp,,,"Apple hardly cares about giving engineers/researchers (outside Apple) a wet dream with their contribution as much as they care about doing what matters - build stuff that people are willing to pay for. They care about that so much that it's evident with their brand realignment from Apple Computers to Apple Inc.<p>""No engineer in his right mind cares about coolness of Apple brand.""
-I am sorry, we must've missed the survey that day on HN<p>""I also rarely see researchers from Apple at any CS conference (WWW, SIGIR, VLDB) while there are thousands of Citation for some of Google's prominent papers PageRank,GFS,MapReduce and countless in IR/Machine Learning.""
-Haha, you are comparing Apple to Orange literally here. Apple completely is a consumer need (hint: people who are willing to pay money to solve their problem) driven company and it's pretty evident - just take a look at the new Apple Tv (sure it's not technically impressive, but they listen alright).<p>And iPad?
-Show me a company from your list that has an unbelievable focus on executing something so well. There's much too fragmentation even at Google's Labs. But Apple somehow works perhaps maybe because of the sheer control of Jobs and that may be all the difference. Remember, the iPhone is no easy feat and that wouldn't have happened if Apple hadn't first started work on iPad. So, in some weird way, the iPad gave seed to iPhone which made iPad possible. And dismissing iPad outright as a design innovation alone would imply anyone could've done it (hey, remember JooJoo Pad?).<p>I am by no means an expert/hardcore fanboy of Apple but your thesis seems to be spread too thin - from your salary discussions, it looks like you are basing your whole line of argument based off a few TC articles. And besides - what kind of recruiters are offering 150k at universities?",1283420992

Yeah, the coffee shop is selling you the 'coffee experience'  - the service, more than they are selling you the coffee.  But if you follow that chain backwards, you can bet that someone along the line is selling actual coffee.<p>to take the example I actually know something about, yeah, dell wants to be my buddy.  But micron?  micron wants to sell me some fucking ram.    Because cheap reliable servers are central to my business, I find my friends elsewhere, and I bypass dell and go to suppliers that don't want to be my friend, and I pocket the difference.<p>On the other hand, when I buy things like accounting services or coffee, I expect something that is more 'full service'  - I know jack about accounting, so you've gotta put me at ease, and be willing to pretty much just handle it for me.   If I didn't know what I know about hardware, and if my servers needed to be reliable but cheap wasn't as big of a deal, I'd think about buying my servers from dell, too, with the silly expensive support plans.  (dell, on the minimum support plan, in my experience is worse than building yourself.  On the other hand, the gold plated support, I hear, is damn good.)<p>So, uh, yeah.  Sometimes you are selling your product, and sometimes you are selling ""the experience"" of the product.  Most of the time, you are selling a little bit of both.<p>But, you are right that it's very important to remember what you are selling...  If you try to sell me 'the experience' when I try to get ram, I'm probably going to walk.  and if dell tried to just sell the servers when they went to sell to $BIGCORP, without the, uh, ""tips"" and gladhanding, they'd loose out just as badly.",1283420846

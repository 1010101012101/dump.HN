The ""Trek"" style uses a ""weird"" setting to enable social commentary that would otherwise be either unpalatable or simply impossible.  In the ""Wars"" style, the ""weird"" setting is the whole point:  the reader/viewer can witness world-building on a grander scale than would otherwise be possible, and the plot can include elements that the audience would never otherwise swallow.<p>There's almost always some crossover between the two, but it's important to remember that each is very difficult to do well.  Very few artists are skilled at both.  A work that tries to focus on both, as Avatar does, usually fails.<p>Avatar is an excellent example of world-building, on possibly a bit too grand a scale for a movie:  there are a handful of things that should have been explained away or lampshaded, but the explanations just wouldn't fit into an already-too-long movie.

Yes, the bad guys are a corporation, but I get the feeling that they did that to make the film more marketable. Americans probably would have a much harder time cheering for the aliens who are slaughtering US Marines. But very little about plot would have changed had the bad guys been military instead of a private corporation.<p>As for anti-technology, I think it's more about the dangers of abusing power of any kind, including the power that technology lends us.",1262045070

I made a search lately of a good invoicing app. I found Freshbook good. However they don't support moneybookers; and I failed finding one.<p>I wonder what invoicing app you use and if you know one that supports Moneybookers.
Thanks",1262045051

It was the typical liberal ""00 was the decade of Bush and Bush is bad"" with a little social media admiration mixed in.<p>The truth, I think, is that the last decade was simply a hard one and George Bush was just a product of his times.  It was a decade where the U.S. chose security over freedom and grew into a nation it didn't want to be. While Bush was just a President who was not wise enough to turn the country around while being appeasing enough to give the nation what it thought it wanted.<p>I know some here love Barack Obama but I think he represents the same one-sided mentality of the last decade.  He is the knee jerk reaction to Bush, opposite in every way and just as extreme to the other side.<p>My hope is that the next decade finds a balance this one has lacked.",1262044971

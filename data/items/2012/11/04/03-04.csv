Third parties have done calculations on the Kindles and found the parts and assembly to be higher than the selling price (without taking into consideration things like shipping, warehouses, credit card fees, etc.).  Amazon is being above board in saying that they're hoping to make their money back via content.<p>In terms of the P/E thing, I only brought it up because of how some investors justify Amazon's price.  Some investors believe that Amazon will be able to get large market power in certain industries (maybe retail, maybe e-content) and then charge higher prices to get fat margins at the expense of consumers.  I don't think that's in Jeff Bezos' ethos (to his credit).  However, cornering a market is a strategy that companies have done.",1352001545

You can't touch the ball with your hands. You have to dribble while running. You can't pass to a teammate when he's too far down-field. All of these are to make the sport better for the players as well as the spectators. The players often complain about the rules, try to get around them and/or fight with the refs, but the appropriate response is generally to call them big whiny babies.<p>That's not to say the refs should be corrupt and influencing the game too much; that needs to be called out when it happens.<p>The way I see it, the game spun out of control (mostly because the rules were changed to favor risk-taking) and now the Fed is trying to reset it to a point where we can all start playing again.

Given the difficulties of actually collecting good data and properly analyzing it, it's no wonder that the same analytical tools, used to great success in some companies, can be rendered useless or even harmful.<p>I'll add that a third reason for the obsession over analytics is that stat reports tend to take the focus off of the decision makers themselves. Managers who aren't confident in (or wishing to escape responsibility from) their decisions can simply blame the numbers and graphs and say they had no other alternative.<p>In some dysfunctional organizations, ""judgement"" and ""decision"" are bad words that imply bias and liability, whereas ""report"" and ""conclusion"" are pure gold.<p>Don't be too discouraged, though.

4738859,comment,4736736,4737777,4,0,neilk,,,"Oh no, you have the problem precisely backwards. Journalism is now a <i>very</i> respectable profession. Which is why it attracts people who don't know anything.<p>It was much better when journalism was a trade that you went into. Street savviness was the journo's hallmark. They had no loyalty to  power, because they came from the wrong side of the tracks, and their livelihood depended on exposing secrets. Great journalists were ugly, ink-stained, alcoholic wretches.<p>Those people are gone. Now there's two kinds of professional journalists. Middle class people who were educated to do journalism at university, fighting over the few scraps of remunerative work left. And people who want to shill for one of the dominant political coalitions. These groups get to the gym a lot more often, but are constrained by their loyalty to the system.<p>So, journalism would be better if it was less respectable. We also need to put a stop to all the social mobility that's happening.

The 6A rating is also predicated on driving the gate hard enough to drive the on Rds to its minimum value.<p>I would be suspicious of this, in conjunction with inadequate heatsinking (i.e. heavy copper pads under the FETs) especially if the FETs are being driven by 3.3v.  Looking at the specs, the FET is rated at 50mOhm given 4.5v gate drive - very acceptable - but if the FET is driven by 3.3v, it will have much higher Rds (may be running in the linear region which would be very bad).  Note that the gate threshold voltage is 1.5v <i>typical</i> but 3v <i>max</i> so driving with a 3.3v logic signal would be marginal in the worst case situation.",1352000008

You could answer this question yourself and anyone else out there would have no better idea than you.<p>Personally, I feel like the once and always most valuable skill is knowing how to ship from A to Z and have a proven track record of this ability. In other words, you have pushed out a quality product which has had some success (probably not enough to quit freelancing or you wouldn't still be doing it.) I believe that most agencies out there don't have this skill / experience. There really isn't much room for it in most dev shops because it's not their specialty, the overhead is high and with a healthy client base, they just don't have the resources. But there there are handful who do this (many of the *labs types of agencies.) Being able to build a product is valuable, but being able to direct (consult) the client to success after the product is built is far more valuable IMO. As an extreme example, just think of how much 37signals could charge if those guys were still doing client work. They probably wouldn't even be building products, but rather consulting for astronomically high rates (but they would still be a bargain for those who could afford to pay the tab.)<p>Another huge value would be to put together an A team which would be able to pull off the above. There are lots of great independent freelancers out there, but not so many crack-shot teams. If you need evidence for this, then just go look at all the aquihiring which has been going on just to grab talented premade teams.<p>Of course, the end game is to make valuable products, and this can break you out of the dollars for hours grind. Build a great product and you can raise your income at internet scale.<p>Do all this and the actual technology / platforms that you use all of a sudden doesn't seem to be of much importance.",1351999890

The fact that the top phones have stayed at 600-700 for the past several years suggests that they are padding costs or simply have no compulsion to be efficient in their supply chains. Google says this is definitely the case and they are still making money on the Nexus 4, even though it costs much less than other flagship phones.<p>Also note just how horrible Motorola built-in UI is, for example. Something's wrong if they can make an inferior project and not expect to get killed. There's a lot of inefficiency at these companies and they don't care and they don't have to care. Google is trying to change that.<p>The Galaxy Nexus was sold at $399 unlocked (some time after release). The Nexus 4 is $299. Google is trying to bring the cost down further. When top-line phones hit $150-200 unlocked, people will be able to upgrade once or twice a year.<p>This will actually encourage even higher quality phones. Once all the topline phones fall to $299 or less, it opens up a space for someone else to make a really, really nice phone at the old $600 level. This is not crazy talk. This is exactly what happened with PC laptops over the last 5 years. Now the better Ultrabooks that are now jockeying for the position of ""high-end PC laptop.""<p>So there are a lot of benefits and I believe the drop in prices will lead to better phones and tablets across the board.",1351998354

Only you know your contact and social information best. We let users create one profile with all of their contact and social information. So when you can add a contact on knok.me you're sending a request to their profile. The syncing solution is very complex. You're still creating duplicate copies of each contact. It is very unnecessary.",1351998307

Google makes changes that sometimes negatively impact someone's business?<p>As long as Google's algorithm is trending in the correct direction (that is towards better quality results) then these complaints are just growing pains and I don't see much of a problem.<p>Some startups are criticised for simply being features of a chosen platform.  Once they get big enough, the platform in control will simply add the feature and eliminate the startup.  I'm unfamiliar with Nextag but it looks like a price comparison site and you could perhaps argue that price comparison is simply a missing feature of Google.",1351998301

They certainly don't advertise it, but you can buy a prepaid SIM card from their website for only a couple bucks and then sign up for this plan. I go over my minutes frequently and pay $.10 per minute for the rest of the month at that point, but it still comes out far cheaper than any regular plan.",1351998100

Thank you for posting this!<p>I normally have a dual-screen setup powered by desktops plus a nice keyboard + mouse.<p>But I'm in the process of moving abroad and will be living out of my laptop for a little while.<p>You see some people at startups working straight off their laptops, day in and out.  After 1-2 days on my raw Macbook, I have no idea how they do it.",1201586118
106005,comment,105444,105665,1,0,atlacatl,,,"I don't agree. Specially when most users post anonymously.<p>For example, I participate here, digg, and reddit, but never give any personal information.<p>For me is more like the getting my turn at the podium without fear of anything, as what I say is not going back to the real me. Of course, if someone really wanted to know who I really am, he or she could find out. But it's not worth the effort.<p>What I really don't get is the people that are so active in these type of sites that it seems that it is all they do. And they are proud of the fact of being so active. I find the comments interesting; however, for me, they are not enough to cover all my social needs.<p>I guess with time, we'll know the full effect of ""socializing"" with cute user-names all day long.",1201586080

106000,comment,105799,105799,0,0,bfioca,,,"This is a case of serious disconnection with user expectations.  You see this all the time - a software company (usually its developers) get so caught up in their code and the way the do things and their own terminology that they forget what users actually want and how they use the products.  smugmug should use this as a learning experience, admit their mistake, and remedy the problem.  I see this as a missed opportunity on their part.",1201585165

105998,comment,105878,105878,0,0,Leon,,,"I article says that application popularity is declining, but could it also be that people are using a wider variety of applications?<p>I'd like to see the numbers on how many app's are installed total vs. time.<p>Just because the top 10 are losing market share doesn't mean all are.  My guess is that more app's have been introduced into the market since developers have had time to make more, and that's where the users are going.",1201584981

105993,comment,105739,105975,0,0,brent,,,"Exactly, he mentioned it as an issue, not as the decision maker.  Given 2 otherwise equivalent candidates (not that they are) who differ on one small issue that you have a stance on, you vote for the one who you agree with.  This is certainly an oversimplification, but the point is that you shouldn't completely ignore _relatively_ small issues because of the existence of bigger issues.  They may just agree (enough) on all of the big issues that are important to you.  You only get to choose one though!",1201583849
105992,comment,105888,105888,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Inc. is the only magazine I regularly read. If I don't have time to skim through the entire thing, I always read the section that documents an entrepreneur's story. Many of those stories are informative and inspirational. One of them a few years ago about the Xerox CEO's humble beginnings kick-started my entrepreneurial spirit, I guess you could say.<p>In my opinion: definitely worth subscribing, if only for that section.",1201583542

The product is useful to a lot of people (Advertisement supported 411 Directory Assistance), and it's a great place to work, learn, and play.<p>What I like best about the company is that it has a very high engineer to manager ratio ;) That's always one of my metrics when looking at new companies.<p>Before that, I worked at Irrational Games (now 2k Games), as the IT manager of the US and AUS offices, working on Bioshock and other games.",1201583322

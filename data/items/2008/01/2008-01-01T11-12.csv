There basic line is, ""I am the best, everyone else is  either stupid or recognizes how great I am. Are you stupid?""<p>Even if these types have talent, they fail to accept it in others, and thus they are very difficult to deal with. They can become better once they go through the school of hard knocks. And I thinks that this Zeb guy (was that his name?) is about to get some knocks. Maybe he will learn some humility... maybe not. Eventually he will learn, but it might take him 30 more years of pain.",1199188446
94100,comment,93716,93796,0,0,bitwize,,,"A running joke between me and a friend of mine is ""signals on wires!"" referring to Jaron Lanier's criticism that all software is brittle because it operates on the ""metaphor"" of a signal traveling down a wire, instead of his preferred metaphor of interacting surfaces or something.<p>Like a nerd-issue Naomi Klein, he's acting as if metaphors are valid criteria on which to assess the technical merits of software. It's really quite ridiculous and indicative of being a bit too fond of the wacky tobacky.",1199186853

This is something that programmers are notoriously poor at; for example programmers-who-are-also-musicians are likely to come up with music tools that make sense to them but utterly baffle nonprogrammer musicians. (Think Csound, Rosegarden, etc.)<p>Things like AutoCAD are innovative not because they contain fancy new algorithms but because they enable large chunks of the population to do things that they couldn't do before. And AutoCAD is proprietary, expensive, and runs only on Microsoft Windows.<p>In short, it's looking more and more like proprietary software is what has brought us real freedom.",1199186635

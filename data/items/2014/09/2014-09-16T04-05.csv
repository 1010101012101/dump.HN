It might be debatable if he was some sort of political leader or humanitarian icon or something, of the sort where humanity&#x27;s misery index actually increases in their absence.<p>However, for all of his good qualities, like 99.9999% of humanity, Notch is not wired up to be a hugely public figure, who is constantly interacting with the public, and is under continuous scrutiny to make another Minecraft.

I&#x27;ve gotta think that after the Microsoft deal, Notch won&#x27;t have to work, but maybe in a few years he might decide to reinvolve himself with the community in a role that is a better fit for him.

It&#x27;s currently bleeding money at an epic rate, and if you assume a $30 to $35 billion market cap, there is almost no scenario in which it can ever justify that by earning a profit (even if revenue were profit today, they&#x27;d still be fairly valued; best case scenario possible is in ten years they&#x27;re worth about what they are now, assuming non-stop growth and that they eventually have a $5b sales / $1.xb profit business)).<p>On the downside of this stock market bubble, when cash is harder to come by, Twitter is still bleeding out, and their growth trails off, the company is worth maybe 15% of what it&#x27;s currently trading for.

E.g. optional type assertions to help guide the optimizer for subsets of the app.<p>In other words: how optimized Ruby implementations we get depends entirely on whether people start trying to use Ruby for things where they badly need them.",1410841442

At the time we were reading Discover Metoer book by Sascha Greif and trying to figure things out using Atmosphere packages. Derby.js was another consideration but since Meteor was more popular we chose it.<p>Anyways looking back, we used so many exotic new tech stacks to do really simple applications which cost more and didn&#x27;t really give other edge. I quit using Javascript on the server side and started to pick up Python.<p>I don&#x27;t plan on going back to Javasscript from Python but Python really lacks a real-time framework like Meteor and still Python to Javascript compiler has not really picked up momentum from what I can see.<p>I think if Python does not bring itself to the browser soon it could mean trouble for future relevance. The fact that we have MEAN stacks and such pisses me off. You don&#x27;t need that shit to write your god damn Facebook clone, just use Python or PHP. OR the famous writing a REST api before you write your website is the even crazier one. It&#x27;s not too late to abstract out a restful backend from your web app until you decide to write blackberry, android, iphone apps.",1410840681

This is not a common operation, but you read it right. It&#x27;ll be between a/b and c/d, and be the number with the smallest denominator between them.<p>(3) Reduce the range to the segment from above containing your number. If the new denominator exceeds your limit, choose the smaller-denominator value. Otherwise, go back to step (2).<p>[There are some delightful proofs of this using tessellation that I strongly encourage you to try to figure out, one of the most interesting puzzles I got from a guy named Anton, the first user of MathOverflow and current Googler.]",1410840678

It might be useful for you to read some of the YC essays to understand what they look for.)<p>Note that originally YC was based around the idea of funding college students to try a startup instead of an internship over their semester break. At that point it was physically based near MIT & Harvard, with a winter (?) campus near Stanford.<p>As you&#x27;d expect, early intakes were dominated by people from those places (ie, mostly white and asian males who attended MIT, Harvard and Stanford). Also as you&#x27;d expect, success takes time, and so we are seeing those early successes moving into roles within YC.<p>I agree that increasing diversity of the YC partners, but it is important to understand the reasons why it is like that currently.<p>I think it is excellent that YC is aware of this problem, and is taking steps to correct it amongst the companies they fund[1][2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.ycombinator.com/diversity-and-startups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ycombinator.com/diversity-and-startups</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/women2/2014/02/03/y-combinators-jessica-livingston-we-just-funded-our-most-diverse-class-ever/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/women2/2014/02/03/y-combinators-...</a>",1410840545

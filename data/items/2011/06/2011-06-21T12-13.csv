Part of Ash's lean canvas[3] even has a spot for alternatives which may even include competitors. The focal point is you need to start testing everything so you can:
      create a customer feedback loop of _learning_[4][4b].<p>Ash's model is a variant of the original ""Business Model Canvas"" which is also very good. I would urge you and everyone to LOOK at the examples and iterations of these models on the main site[5].<p>Some of the questions you start asking in this exercise are:
 - What is the problem your solving, and what are the possible solutions?
 - How will you reach customers, who are the early adopters?<p>Its never too late, and like I said actually the beginning of the exercise.<p>Even if you 'know this already', I would urge you to re-test and re-focus on your previous lean canvases/models. Success is in the finer details. Remember, you never stop learning about the customer. You want a 'specific' customer? You develop a strategy - focused on the problem.<p>So there you go, a 'teaser' on building a better product. Now go read Eric Ries's[6] book[7], Steve Blank's book[8] for overall strategy. See the business model generation book and site[9] (there is an ipad app!) for more finer details. There is also a cheat sheet for Steve's book[10].<p>I myself am learning this as I recover from a failed startup attempt[11]. Yes, I'm for hire atm and would LOVE to join another team.

2678528,comment,2676739,2677959,2,0,bluekeybox,,,"Thanks for the response, that was interesting, especially the superstition in pigeons link. When I wrote about magical thinking, I was more concerned about worship than the kind of superstition you describe; I wasn't very clear about that (I'm not a neuroscientist). What you were trying to describe seems to be how brain generates rationalizations for events. My opinion is that the these rationalizations you describe as ""magical thinking"" are in fact the same type of thought process that also occurs on much higher levels, when scientists generate hypotheses for example -- except that expert scientists have far more experience to ""ground"" these rationalizations correctly (i.e. on evidence that is empirical and can be replicated and validated).<p>Although the rationalizations you describe are probably the origin for many magical beliefs, my opinion is that those beliefs don't perpetuate/last very long unless they are also associated with worship of some type. My observation was that most forms of religion and mysticism are concerned about ""soul"" or some other supposedly magical property of humans. Homeopathy is probably one of the few types of magical thinking that doesn't really concern itself with human beings as being special, but I think that most other types do.<p>I don't consider worship to be a very complex phenomenon -- I think that it is simply an innate or readily acquired (at early stages of development) mechanism that triggers intense pleasure when confronted with individuals or objects that possess many desired characteristics (above a certain threshold). When combined with rationalizing magical thinking you describe, worship results in us placing unreasonable trust in the individuals/objects possessing those characteristics.",1308660915

2678517,comment,2677899,2677899,38,0,yaakov34,,,"Passionate and unconvincing. You can't get around the fact that WebGL lets a website control the graphics driver in a way which is much too direct for comfort. The central problem is the poor quality of driver code compared to OS code. If these were of equal quality, then indeed this would be no more dangerous than a JVM. [EDIT: and for extra danger, the driver code generally runs at elevated privilege.] You can presumably exploit a hole in the OS by executing something in a JVM, but that's been an extremely rare exploit because of the high quality of the JVM and OS code in the relevant parts of their interface. This thing opens a huge attack surface against much more vulnerable code. Driver code is buggy, usually prematurely released in a rush to market, and deliberately closed and obscured. Maybe the answer is to make that code better across all the graphics companies, but until this happens, I fear WebGL.<p>The guy himself gives examples in which they have to work around known bugs which exploit vulnerabilities with formally valid inputs. But what about the unknown bugs? Those are the ones that will get us, no?<p>Now, I don't know if Flash 11 or Silverlight are just as bad. Maybe they are (although I see claims in this thread that this is not so for Silverlight). But this is not a good reason to support a hugely insecure technology. It's a reason to fear these other technologies as well.",1308660661

Allocation lots of little objects and then discarding them shortly after is a use case the JVM is well optimized for. You would have to allocate an extraordinary number of such objects to see any real slowdown.<p>The Oracle JVM uses generational garbage collection[1]. Glossing over some details, this garbage collector divides objects into generations depending on how long they've been around, and also keeps track of references that cross generations. Objects that are newly created go into the first generation. If the objects don't refer to objects outside of the first generation, it is very cheap for the VM to determine they are in fact garbage. When the garbage collector gets run, objects that a still live get copied to another generation. Once the still live objects are copied out, the VM doesn't need to do any cleanup to get rid of the dead objects, it simply marks the whole memory block the first generation was in as available.<p>[1] Not that other JVMs don't, but I only know the official one.",1308660244

You can succeed with fewer features by being, for example, simpler. That's the 37signals ""do less"" line. You say features are crucial for your white-label solution. Are you so sure? Why do you think this is? How do you know this is why you are losing customers? (""Clearly"" is a dangerous word). Who do you think your customers are? What if your customers were somebody else? (See point 3).<p>2. ""...even though their price point is higher..."" - this suggests you don't know that high price is often <i>precisely</i> why customers choose things. High prices suggest high quality, and in the absence of other ways of distinguishing between products, it's a very easy one for people to follow. Perhaps you charge so little that you give the impression of not being serious? And, relatedly, perhaps if you charged more you would be able to spend more to acquire users?<p>3. Pick a niche and own it. If your site works for user types X, Y and Z, just pick some subset of X to go after. Your product will be more targeted to them, which makes it easier for them to see it as something they could use, and it also should make it easier for you to market. See, for example, the many sites that offer build-your-own-websites for photographers, as opposed to simply just build-your-own-websites for everybody.<p>4. Win on design, on copywriting, on user experience, on humour, on speed, on sociality, on security, on reliability, on locality, on trust, on friendliness. Win on anything that's not what you can't win on. On the internet, there's room for more than one winner.<p>But, like I said, if we could see your site you'll get better answers.",1308659137

2678396,comment,2675433,2677634,2,0,danssig,,,"I share you views.  Making a web app is easier for the developer: just one platform to support, no restrictions on implementation, etc.  But a desktop app is nicer for the <i>users</i> (the ones we're supposed to care about, right?).  In the very best case a web app would be able to function as good as a desktop app.  The best case is usually not achieved.<p>Imagine if a person at your job said they had just made a new client app for your business users workflow.  When you ask how it's implemented the person says that the GUI itself is just a skin that reads <i>everything</i> from the database.  The GUI layout, how the buttons behave, all of it is stored in the database and the actual GUI is nothing more than a kind of platform for what's in the database.  I've actually seen this done and the team who did it were sacked, their application deprecated.  As far as I know it's still running because the team in charge of replacing it still doesn't completely understand it.  But this is what web apps are.  Model, view, presenter, they're all stored in the same place.<p>Personally, I prefer having a back end RESTful server with native... shall we say ""fit"" clients (not fat but not thin either) using it.  The browser gets a simplified, default version of the app which has a link to the appropriate native client somewhere visible.",1308658266

We then even noticed that some of our earlier Beta users have also moved on to said competitor. We know, because we require a domain name to sign up for an account, and, since they use a stealth iframe pointer/redirect on their domain name, it's easy to find out what platform they are currently using. Think JanesCustomJewelry.com switching from Volusion to Shopify.<p>My question to all is: what next? Clearly our users are choosing our competitors because they have better features and more customization options, which are crucial for a white-label solution, even though their price point is higher. It will be hard to differentiate via a features battle; they have an army of developers.<p>Any advice? Or do we just do our thing, engage with our users, and reiterate until product/market fit? It's hard to ignore a competitor and very tempting to copy what they do. We have a feeling that whatever paying customers we have are only paying customers because they have not discovered our competitor.

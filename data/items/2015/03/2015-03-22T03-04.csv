MVC doesn&#x27;t succeed at either, except in idealized corner cases.<p>[1] A lot of widgets in Windows, for instance text fields, encapsulate the view (it&#x27;s where the text is displayed), the model (which keeps the text in the control), and the controller (the widget handles the UI for entering text, catches and handles the mouse, etc.).",1426996778

In an adult relationship, it&#x27;s the difference between &quot;You make me feel bad when you do xyz&quot; and &quot;Why do you always have to be such an a-hole&quot; - these are two very different ways to raise an issue.<p>That&#x27;s what many (including me) are saying about autism. The point is not to cherish harmful behaviors. The point is to cherish the children who are different. Their differences make it harder for them to learn some behaviors, but they do have a positive side much of the time.<p>My son is awesome and I would change nothing.

After the original authors left the company with deep knowledge, a complete UI redesign went from uphill battle to sheer cliff climb. Once every generation comes and goes, rewrites just get more complex. Even then, the code then was probably based on standards from that long ago, and its quality will most definitely slow you down. Now couple that with the problem of high turn over, and no one wants to handle the shit pile. We keep shoveling things over to get paid.<p>Considering the staggering size some of these projects are (peripheral evidence of complexity like table counts as mentioned here, and more solid evidence like raw lines of code, number of UI controls from big to small), it quickly becomes economically infeasible to put a modern shine on things when you have features you could be building to make more sales.<p>A decent UI in 2000 looked much different from now anyway.

I think a call for citation followed by random anecdote is not a great response to an invitation for a thoughtful dialog with someone with unique experience in the field.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re talking about a completely different issue, or the flip side of the same coin. Awareness and sensitivity to others&#x27; abilities I guess could be on the same spectrum as making excuses for violent behavior, but I think it&#x27;s different forces at play.<p>We definitely need more empathy in this world (and lets not even get into police assault here). But at the same time, there can be a good reason why a child is misbehaving or even acting violently, but that behavior is still unacceptable. I&#x27;ve never personally experienced the parent who feels like their child is entitled to their kid&#x27;s violent outburst in public space ____, but certainly we hear the stories. More often, I just feel awful for parents who are dealing with a meltdown in the moment, because, been there, done that.<p>As a parent in that situation, it&#x27;s usually just, &quot;ok, lets get the heck out of here.&quot; As a parent watching those situations, I always want to help somehow, but it seems like there&#x27;s a huge taboo to even acknowledge the situation, let alone try to intervene. Personally I&#x27;d be too afraid to even open my mouth because the other parent would assume I was going to chastise them rather than try to help somehow.",1426996364

9245479,comment,9245022,9245107,0,0,i14ng,,,"If you want to understand what the current research says it means, a great book is Rethinking Autism by Lynn Waterhouse; see my review of it at <a href=""http://intellectualizing.net/2013/12/17/book-rethinking-autism-variation-and-complexity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intellectualizing.net/2013/12/17/book-rethinking-auti...</a> and the book on Amazon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Autism-Complexity-Lynn-Waterhouse/dp/0124159613"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Autism-Complexity-Lynn-Wate...</a><p>The &quot;disease&quot; analogy is grossly misleading because it makes you think it&#x27;s a single &quot;thing&quot; with a single cause; the right analogy is to a dimensional trait (such as intelligence), or traits perhaps (such as both social/communication skills on the one hand, and repetitive behaviors on the other). Then think about many different conditions resulting in this trait, much as many different conditions result in intellectual disability (or intellectual superiority). As with intellectual disability, autism diagnosis is more of a semi-arbitrary cutoff on the scale, rather than a binary yes-or-no.<p>I say &quot;semi-&quot; arbitrary because diagnosis is an attempt to locate &quot;where on this scale people start to really need extra help,&quot; but &quot;arbitrary&quot; because there isn&#x27;t a strong scientific reason to put it at say 99.1 percentile vs 89.9 percentile.<p>As with variation in intelligence, autism appears to be mostly genetic, with some impact from environment. The underlying condition resulting in autistic traits varies a lot. Sometimes, the condition may have other consequences, such as seizures or intellectual disability. Other times, the condition is best thought of as simply an extreme personality type, or something like that.<p>Think about how various conditions resulting in ID can have accompanying issues (such as heart problems with Down syndrome). When someone says seizures or gut problems or whatever are &quot;autism,&quot; that&#x27;s like saying heart problems are intellectual disability. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Autism is just the social/communication part, not everything that&#x27;s up with someone.<p>If you work in tech, you know a lot of autistic people, you just maybe don&#x27;t know it, and they often do not know it themselves. Some of them are quite successful and not &quot;obvious&quot;; others are extremely clear to anyone who knows what to look for. But most of them probably do have some level of real disability, or if nothing else did have some level of it as children.<p>For many of us the disability is primarily in personal life (friends, etc.), or historical childhood difficulty, and we are highly competent at work.<p>I did not imagine that the diagnostic label applied to me until my son was diagnosed; but now I realize that it does apply or very nearly apply to me and several people I know (but I have no idea how to bring it up). Especially when they are having kids, I wish I&#x27;d known earlier that autism can be kind of the way my family is and many people I know are, and that it isn&#x27;t always this big scary thing.<p>The tech industry should be much better informed about autism given its prevalence in our coworkers and ourselves. Even the many who aren&#x27;t diagnosable may be closer to autistic than to average.<p>When those of us who are around 40 were kids, the diagnostic rate for autism was about 1/1000 and it&#x27;s now a bit above 1/100, higher for boys. So the delta between those is the number of undiagnosed adults walking around today, who would have been diagnosed by modern criteria. It&#x27;s a lot of people.<p>Some number of those got a different dx in the past (such as intellectual disability), but the kinds who are now in tech probably got no diagnosis at all most of the time, other than &quot;weird kid.&quot;",1426995838

I personally prefer my engineers to have the second.<p>I tried hiring the normal way (CV, white board) and had one candidate worth speaking to in over 200 applicants.<p>We decided to try something else. We stopped reading any cover letter or CV and wrote that in the job ad. We asked candidates to build a simplified version of what the job was about, taking about 4 hours, then to send us the code which we&#x27;d discuss with them over the phone at their convenience. Anybody whose code passed would be hired, and if people couldn&#x27;t be bothered because they were already famous they could send us their libraries. Nobody took the Starcraft best of 7 option :(<p>Why we did this:<p>- having to write code eliminates those who can&#x27;t, or who can&#x27;t be bothered; not having complex unrelated hoops to jump through eliminated those who are good at career climbing;<p>- we replaced the hours candidates would normally spend dealing with HR or travelling to a site for something (&quot;cultural fit&quot;) that overselects the polished anyway, with something people we want would enjoy doing (solving a problem, writing code);<p>- no pressure, access to your &quot;external brain&quot; (Google, your own libraries) unlike with a white board; allows for the anxious to pass, and those who outsource a lot of their knowledge to the machine (like me);<p>- you can tell a lot about how people will approach their job from the way they approach the small version of it; documentation, structure, abstraction levels, choice of libraries, and if you&#x27;re wrong about the candidate&#x27;s reasons you can always clear it up in the chat;<p>- it&#x27;s fair because everybody has to tackle the same problem;<p>- no discrimination since it&#x27;s all ability based: I took to Skype-text-chatting with candidates instead of voice calls mostly because I don&#x27;t like talking on the phone.

Another team member didn&#x27;t have a CV; it&#x27;s because he was just finishing high school, as we discovered when we talked to him, but his code was good enough, so he got the offer and skipped university.<p>I&#x27;ve never had to put out another job ad (not for myself anyway) because I have so many qualified candidates left over from that round, and from the team network. Surprisingly, we didn&#x27;t get spammed; the requirement to post code seems to have been mostly understood and we only had a half dozen &quot;dear Sir/Madam&quot;s.<p>So I disagree with you, but YMMV.

The message format standard commonly used to pass HL7 messages right now are quite easy to parse, it is basically a CSV file using pipes and carets as field separators. Any technology worth integrating right now speaks HL7 one way of another already. Even if some reverse-engineering is needed, it is a 100% technical endeavour that does not need any political buy-in (except budgeting) - this is what I like to define as &quot;annoying sort of a problem&quot;.<p>> If all the vendors spoke JSON (or some common, generic format) then you would only need to figure out a mapping for each vendor to your unified, internal schema.<p>This is not easy at all if your internal schema has less fidelity/dimensionality than the vendor. Expanding on my example above, suppose you have a smart weighing scale a la Withings scale that integrates with the EMR. The weighing scale has the patient&#x27;s height input so it is able to send BMI <<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index></a> reading to the EMR as well. However, your EMR does not have a field for BMI because it is a computed/derived value of weight and height.<p>If your internal schema has higher fidelity than the vendor, you also are forced to impute data - this is not as bad but may cause unintended behaviours as well. A contrived example: the weighing scale only has the patient&#x27;s identity information. However in your EMR the weight readings can only be stored associated with a visit/encounter (aka a hospital stay or appointment). You can associate the reading with the last open visit/encounter, but this will have undesirable repercussions e.g. during system downtime (it might become associated with the wrong visit).<p>There are ways to solve the above integration issue but they would cost a lot and may significantly impact the EMR all the way to end-user UI. So it is not only a technical issue but also whether the users are comfortable with the amount of complexity introduced in the UI, data imputation, etc.",1426994835

The Talmud explains that this &quot;rest&quot; (while including) does not specifically refer to manual labor, rather the act of creation, embodied in the 39 &quot;categories&quot; of work which were performed in, and when building, the Tabernacle (the predecessor to the Temple, originally built after Sinai, which accompanied the Jews throughout their travels in the desert). The Talmud discusses at length what is included in these categories, what is considered similar enough to be forbidden as well, etc.<p>Essentially, these aren&#x27;t loopholes, but ways of getting the same results without performing any forbidden acts. Of course, there are things which are frowned upon as not within the &quot;spirit&quot; of the Sabbath, e.g. leaving a television on.<p>In addition, I noticed some people mentioned the &quot;eruv&quot;, a string around a neighborhood which allows the residents to carry within it on the Sabbath. This too is not really a loophole, as the biblical prohibition of carrying on the Sabbath was only to and from or inside a public thoroughfare (at least 24-36 feet wide, with at least 600,000 people passing through each day), which is relatively uncommon. The Rabbis of the Talmud (in accordance with the teaching &quot;make boundaries around the Torah&quot;in order to prevent people from accidentally transgressing the Torah) further added the prohibition to carry to and from or inside &quot;semi-public&quot; areas or, to put it another way, non-private areas, or from one area (private or otherwise) to another. With this added prohibition, however, they included an exception. That is, if one puts a fence or string around the entire area (again, this excludes &quot;true&quot; public thoroughfares), thereby symbolically making it one area, one is permitted to carry within it. This is not technically a &quot;loophole&quot;, but a solution that ensures that one remembers not to carry in a public area on the Sabbath.<p>Jewish law is much more complex, logically built, and developed than one might think, and I encourage you not to dismiss most observant Jews&#x27; practice of it as &quot;cheating&quot;, or &quot;hypocritical&quot;.<p>This is of course a very limited discussion of the topics involved, as most observant Jews spend years (!) studying the laws and their implications.

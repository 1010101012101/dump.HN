35974,comment,35938,35938,0,0,jmtame,,,"I think vesting is a good idea for the founders (it's in their best interest), but I think if you're asking for someone to commit to such a long time period (ie 4-5 years), then it better be really good equity.  Even better than if it were just offered ""up front.""  There are also opportunity costs to consider, so your early employees or co-founders could be off starting their own companies with a lot more equity.  So it's probably going to vary by each person, but in my experience, the vested equity has to be really good or I'm not interested.<p>I've been in startups where the vested equity was really low, and I left (I was employee #1).  I've also talked with numerous people who thought about joining the same startup, and refused due to a number of reasons, but low equity was mentioned as one of the first reasons.",1185144462

35968,comment,35918,35918,0,0,felipe,,,"I don't know if it will be the next big language, but I strongly believe there is a space for JS on the server side (actually ECMAScript). Why should web developers deal with two sets of languages? (JS on the client and whatever else on the server)<p>I am a long-time Java and C++ developer. More recently I've been actively developing in Flex, and I'm impressed with ActionScript (which now is ECMAScript). I for one would love to use ECMAScript on the server as well (today I use Java EE 5). ",1185143037

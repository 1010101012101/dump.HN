Google have been doing this for ages and no one has said anything, but now all of a sudden its a thing?<p>I just want people to acknowledge that what Google has been doing and what everyone else is doing is essentially the SAME THING. No reason one company should get a pass over others.<p>Now as for whether privacy is a legitimate concern or not is another matter entirely and I think comes down to a bit of personal preference too.<p>I for one, don't care about my privacy -- to an extent. There I said it. I don't care if Google knows that I eat somewhere or do something because it's trivial to me as long as my data is SECURE and I have fine grained privacy CONTROLS. If you give me security and control, then I'll gladly hand over my data for a useful service such as mail, or chat, or photos or whatever it may be.<p>Privacy in 2013 is different, and we must acknowledge that. This is a new generation, a new era. If you want to stay disconnected, then you don't get to experience this new world and if that's your preference, that's perfectly fine. (note: there will always be a subset of vocal technically inclined people like many of us on the forum that will try to resist, but in the long run, we won't prevail; I have ghostery installed for the hell of it, but a large amount of people don't even know what it is).<p>I think moving forward, every individual is going to have some type of public web presence that will be as much a part of who they are as anything else. Some parts of this presence will be private and tucked away behind anonymous usernames and private content. Other parts will be open for the world to see. To an extent, all of this is already true, but think about all the kids born from 2005 onward. They're only 8 years old now and are going to be part of the new, always connected generation (meaning, they've never known a world otherwise).<p>Therefore I think security of data is more important than EVER. Every company should make security of user data a TOP priority. In addition, every company should provide FINE GRAINED privacy CONTROL to allow the user to decide what he/she wants to show and to whom. On the other hand, a user should expect that a web company pays its bills through targeting via user data, and should reflect upon his/her expectation of privacy on the web.<p>The web is the new TV, but different, and more powerful, much more powerful.",1367218501

I strongly recommend you read <i>Think and Grow Rich</i>:<p><a href=""http://archive.org/details/Think_and_Grow_Rich"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.org/details/Think_and_Grow_Rich</a><p>Here's a taste:<p>TRULY, ""thoughts are things,"" and powerful things at that, when they are mixed with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a BURNING DESIRE for their translation into riches, or other material objects.<p>A little more than thirty years ago, Edwin C. Barnes discovered how true it is that men really do THINK AND GROW RICH. His discovery did not come about at one sitting. It came little by little, beginning with a BURNING DESIRE to become a business associate of the great Edison.<p>One of the chief characteristics of Barnes' Desire was that it was definite. He wanted to work with Edison, not for him. Observe, carefully, the description of how he went about translating his DESIRE into reality, and you will have a better understanding of the thirteen principles which lead to riches. When this DESIRE, or impulse of thought, first flashed into his mind he was in no position to act upon it. Two difficulties stood in his way. He did not know Mr. Edison, and he did not have enough money to pay his railroad fare to Orange, New Jersey. These difficulties were sufficient to have discouraged the majority of men from making any attempt to carry out the desire.<p>But his was no ordinary desire! He was so determined to find a way to carry out his desire that he finally decided to travel by ""blind baggage,"" rather than be defeated. (To the uninitiated, this means that he went to East Orange on a freight train). He presented himself at Mr. Edison's laboratory, and announced he had come to go into business with the inventor. In speaking of the first meeting between Barnes and Edison, years later, Mr. Edison said, ""He stood there before me, looking like an ordinary tramp, but there was something in the expression of his face which conveyed the impression that he was determined to get what he had come after. I had learned, from years of experience with men, that when a man really DESIRES a thing so deeply that he is willing to stake his entire future on a single turn of the wheel in order to get it, he is sure to win. I gave him the opportunity he asked for, because I saw he had made up his mind to stand by until he succeeded. Subsequent events proved that no mistake was made.""",1367218283

They need the power, money and resources of a government.<p>More to the point, they need an entity that is both powerful enough to force change and not bound by the same incentives that the polluting companies are.<p>It's down to a Nash equilibrium, which is the stable strategy that obtains when everyone makes the best decision possible for them knowing what everyone else has decided. There's no way for anyone to unilaterally change their minds without losing something, which is why the strategy is stable even if it is completely insane.<p>In this case, the stable strategy is to pollute and not invest anything in cleanup, because the first company to unilaterally invest in cleaning up will lose profits relative to all of its competitors who aren't cleaning anything. That isn't acceptable. Therefore, Mumbai has brown oceans and Beijing has brown air.<p>The only way out is for some powerful entity that <i>isn't</i> bound by the same Nash equilibrium to step in and <i>force</i> a new equilibrium state by imposing penalties on the polluters.

The same simple interface would only have a ""more control"" (aka settings) button, as usual, and as platforms converge the low-level support pretty much comes for free (for example, if phones used x86_64 instead of ARM, USB boot would be implied).

One technique is to have the user associate some rare signal, like thinking the word ""chair"" repeatedly, with an action, and let the user learn to use that signal quickly in the same way that you've learned to use command-tab. This is mostly done by tracking changes in blood oxygenation using infrared sensors or fMRI. Another technique is to tap into the user's motor cortex completely blindly, show the user the output, and let neuroplasticity[1] take care of the rest; this works <i>astonishingly</i> well, with monkeys being able to ""quickly learn to voluntarily control the firing rates of individual and multiple neurons"" and directly control robotic arms [2].<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity</a>\n2: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braincomputer_interface#Early_work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braincomputer_interface#Early_...</a>",1367217909

Most desktop owners never replace their own hard drive, but that feature comes in quite handy to the computer techs who are expected to, or if the included software eventually fails and needs to be reset.",1367216243

Widespread public problems this this cannot be solved by individual citizens or organizations. They need the power, money and resources of a government.<p>> the country is so populated that it is extremely hard to make this drastic of an imposition and follow through with it.<p>Population is oft quoted as the root cause of most problems in India. Perhaps it is. But population certainly doesn't explain why these problems don't get addressed or get the attention they deserve. That again is because the government of India does not effectively govern and manage the country. Elected officials rule over their subjects via institutions and political systems whose goals are more aligned with keeping them in power than the welfare of citizens. They lack a fundamental understanding that their job as an elected official is to govern and address issues of their citizens.<p>Problems like this can only be resolved with effective governance from which springs awareness, policies, infrastructure, funding and programs. But what happens when the people governing simply dont care for their people?",1367216082

As I mentioned earlier that all people who hack such interviews do have basic understanding/skills requisite for the corp, quite enough to play the gymnastics of the interviews.<p>A good interviewer does try to gauge whether the answer was known to the interviewee. But I have seen that happen far more at hot startups than big companies- primarily because of their more stringent process which leaves less wiggle room for guess work and is more tuned towards concretely judged parameters.<p>I just don't like the facade of 'hiring the smartest people' in the world, when their mechanism largely filters just well-trained average people.<p>And I most certainly don't want to sound condescending, so I apologize before-hand. But I probably used a different definition of average than what you or most people here may have in mind. I know quite a few ACM ICPC world finalists, am a region finalist myself, and have conducted/ published CS research with reasonable impact. So I was simply using my PhD program peers as good, and people with lesser (proven) skills as average. My fault, but I hope you can see what I was trying to say.",1367216052

For example interface patterns, typography and color palettes can be evaluated without opinion.<p>Interface patterns have their best use cases and the designer needs to pick the right one for each part of the design, making sure it works as a whole.<p>Typography is based on making text easily readable - there's always some leeway for opinionated typography but a designer shouldn't stray far from best practices.<p>While the exact colors in a palette can be opinionated, they too have characteristics that should be assessed without opinion. Are there enough contrast between the colours? What if the user is colorblind? Will people with low vision be able to see everything clearly, especially text? Are the colors appropriate for their intended use, for example a red hue for alert, green for success)?<p>""It does not look right"" and ""it does not work"" are the kind of feedback you get from people who don't know the inner logics of a design.

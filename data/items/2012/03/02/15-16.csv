3657008,comment,3655582,3655582,2,0,crewtide,,,"Glad to see people suggesting exercise (spacefood, chaostheory, juliano_q, others), as well as other tools to change the underlying depression.  I think the important takeaway is that this is not ""startup depression"" -- it's depression.  You'll be happier/more successful if you find a way to get rid of it.<p>Sure, running a startup is going to have ups and downs.  Sure, you'll sometimes fail at what you're trying to do, and you'll sometimes feel that failure deeply.  Failing comes from trying to do something really difficult; taking that failure personally comes from being human.<p>But as a general rule, the founders I know from the (pretty hoppin') Boston scene are born optimists.  More than any other group of people I know, they believe despite the odds, they bounce back quickly, and they have pretty tough skins.<p>Depression is hard to sort out, but totally worth it.  It's worth it for anybody, but necessary for founders because of the up & down nature of running a startup.  I spent much of my adult life beating my head against a wall, occasionally being depressed, and not understanding why I couldn't make sh*t happen.  Then a few years ago I figured myself out (combination of exercise, gratitude, & therapy), and since then everything has been different.  Externally, my life took a major turn for the better in every arena from relationships to finances.  Internally, I just don't have the resistance I used to really suffer from, and my downs are pretty short.  It rocks.<p>So I guess I feel your pain, but don't glorify it.  Do the work to get over it.  You'll be much happier.",1330703822
3657007,comment,3655440,3656632,1,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"What I'm trying to suggest is that the point at which a schema is powerful and generic enough to work as a general-purpose web service API for an arbitrary use case, it has become more difficult and complicated to learn, configure and use than a much simpler, discoverable ad-hoc schema that closely matches the functionality of your web service.<p>In general, REST principles give more than they take, which is why I try to follow them; but you're always going to have to find the sweet spot of abstraction that provides the right amount of power and flexibility combined with the right amount of discoverability and predictability.<p>> What's the cost of just changing the mediatype to some different string?<p>I'm happy to change a server's content-type from application/json to application/vnd.my-adhoc-service+json, but that won't change the client's need to read my documentation and play with the service before they can figure out how to use it. That's true even if I move the documentation out to an RFC.<p>One real advantage I can see is to use the media type for versioning, but even that doesn't remove the need for a client to intervene if they want to upgrade their code to work with the newer API version.<p>So it's not really clear to me that a custom media type is significantly more useful for the client, even if it is more 'proper'. When a constraint feels ceremonial, I become suspicious that it exists to drive purity-for-its-own-sake rather than a real benefit.",1330703821

3657000,comment,3656522,3656959,2,0,nicholas_tuzzio,,,"Trusting Intel and trusting your fab are different problems.  Intel creates a design and sends it to the fab.  Intel has to trust that the fab will not alter their design, but in general that is an extremely difficult attack to carry out and would most likely require the fab to have a much more in-depth understanding of the IC design than they likely have.  However, Intel can put whatever they want into an IC and it would be incredibly difficult for anyone to find it.<p>Also, trusting your compiler is different from trusting your CPU because one is much, much easier to check than the other.  You can build GCC yourself, look at the source code, manually check the output.  You could even write your own compiler.  In general, we can't make our own processors or verify their internals, yet.",1330703769

Imagine a US paper runs a story about a Japanese theft where 1,000,000 YEN are stolen. Let's assume I don't follow world currency markets, so I have no idea what the YEN:USD rate is. I might assume some level of equivalency and walk away with the impression that somewhere around a million USD were stolen. That would be inaccurate. The responsible editorial decision is to provide the reader some accessible basis for understanding the facts.<p>The reason you're being called out for condescension/trolling is because the point you're making is entirely irrelevant to the discussion. Is Bitcoin a real/valid currency? It doesn't matter in the context of this theft. What's relevant is the value of those Bitcoins at the time they were stolen. That's how matters of theft are assessed. Criminal charges are levied based on the value of the items stolen.<p>Another thing to consider is the thoughtlessness of discussing the relative merits of Bitcoin as a currency when someone just lost a couple hundred thousand dollars.

He even appears tolerable, approachable and maybe even someone who would listen to reason. Is it a front? We have every reason to think it is.<p>Personally, I never would have thought I'd hear the RIAA talk about millions of songs for $10/month. Question of course is, did the RIAA kill the subscription model and then announce it's failure? Still, $10/month is pocket change in exchange for never having to hunt for music.<p>There is an invisible sheath of social truth. The elephant in the room. We've all pirated music, software or movies at some point. None of us openly admit it, and if asked we all say ""Ya, the artist should be compensated"". Then we pirate more music and movies, proclaiming, ""They're the thieves! They give artists X% of the profits!"". True. But I still don't see an argument for pirating music - or at least, pirating music but pretending you think it is wrong.<p>I don't think anyone wants to pirate music. What people want is convenience. If the incentive for route X is greater than route Y, route X is destined to be the popular route by default. $10/month vs. searching the pirate bay every time I hear a new song I like? $10/month wins.<p>The RIAA is generally evil, don't get me wrong.

Here is why:<p>From: <a href=""http://www.damninteresting.com/space-radio-more-static-less-talk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.damninteresting.com/space-radio-more-static-less-...</a><p><i>When any non-focused electromagnetic signal is generatedâ such as a television broadcast or a cell phone conversationâ the energy propagates as a spherical wavefront at the speed of light. When a sphere is doubled in diameter, its surface area increases by a factor of four; but in a spherical wave the âsurface areaâ is the energy itself. This means the signalâs energy is spread over four times more area at twice the distance, resulting in a 75% loss in intensity. To put it another way, in order for a broadcasting tower to double its effective range for a given receiver, it must quadruple its transmitting power.</i><p><i>To demonstrate the degrading effect of distance on an everyday omnidirectional signal, one might imagine a spacecraft equipped with an Arecibo-style radio receiver directed towards the Earth. If this hypothetical spacecraft were to set out for the interstellar medium, its massive 305-meter wide dish would lose its tenuous grip on AM radio before reaching Mars. Somewhere en route to Jupiter, the UHF television receivers would spew nothing but static. Before passing Saturn, the last of the FM radio stations would fade away, leaving all of Earthâs electromagnetic chatter behind well before leaving our own solar system.</i><p>And: <a href=""http://blog.jackadam.net/2011/the-tiny-humanity-bubble/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jackadam.net/2011/the-tiny-humanity-bubble/</a>",1330703189

People who work on the product should have a significant share of the profits as well. Allegedly a regular employee is ""taking less risk"" by having a fixed salary as opposed to the ""risk takers"" at the top - but in this day and age where there is no more guaranteed long-term job stability, that is not true anymore.

I set out to do this not to copy the culture of silicon valley, rather the culture of the Amsterdam Startup scene and especially the Appsterdam Initiative.<p>When i was at Startup Weekend Amsterdam and got to meet Mike Lee and others it occured to me that this was a concept that was much more realistic for a european and especially german city.<p>In Germany getting VC Money is not easy and you have to be very careful how the deal is done because of Tax issues. Taking risks is very unpopular in Germany and failed startups are viewed upon as wasted money and time, failed founders are looked upon as pariahs.<p>To combat this all that helps is a very strong community that has a common denominator where people share their point of view which is different from most of the people around them and help them with problems that are common only to startups in germany.<p>Non-Startup-event-wise our city isn't bad. Our Webmondays draw >100 people, our Barcamps over 200. We've got a local Hackerspace which offers 3D Printing Workshops among other things. We have a strong web culture, although Co-Working spaces are still being set up and are still more expensive than i would like them to be.<p>Frankfurt is known mostly as a banking city and some Venture Capital Groups are based here. It's not ideal as office space doesn't come as cheap as elsewhere, but the infrastructure in Frankfurt is superb and I've never met so many qualified Freelancers as in the Rhine-Main-Area.<p>The founder of one of the current YC Company Popset, Nicolas BÃ¶s, is from Frankfurt and very excited that we're building something here, which comes to show that we have the potential here.",1330700763

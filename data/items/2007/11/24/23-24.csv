On a weekday during business hours excluding lunch you're fine.<p>Trying to do high concentration work in a coffee shop would be impossible for me, personally.  I don't understand how one could do development.  The places I go the general idea is that people are interruptible and open to some conversation and maybe a date.<p>I have used hotel lobbies.  Find a spot to sit and hack the guest wireless for access.  The decor and furniture at a nice hotel can be enjoyable.  Sometimes you can find an open conference room.<p>The public library is an obvious option, but they tend to close too early.<p>Another option is to sneak into local college libraries, or even unused campus classrooms with wireless access.",1195948725

All sources have some error and bias, not just Wikipedia. You want to deal with that, teach? Require more sources.<p>How much you want to bet those same teachers go home and watch Fox News at night?",1195948434

143843,comment,143148,143748,0,0,gruseom,,,"I remember that when I was taught the phatic function of language, it was a minor epiphany. Prior to that, I thought of small talk (nice weather today, how was your weekend, how about those Broncos) as meaningless bullshit, which was really a problem for me. That concept made me understand that it isn't meaningless, it just has a different kind of meaning than referential language does (which really would be about the weather). Phatic language is about maintaining the connection. It communicates, ""I think you're worth communicating with, you're an acceptable interlocutor"" and so on. It's used most often with people one doesn't know well because it signals reduced risk. Without it, people feel tense and suspicious. No doubt there are deep-seated reasons for this.<p>But that doesn't at all mean that it should play the same role in writing.",1206251538

143835,comment,143735,143820,0,0,girk,,,"@DocSavage, I'm not sure I understand your response. If you spend your time working with gifted kids (or talented young entrepreneurs), I think you invariably develop some expertise on how to identify them, in ""the wild,"" in ""captivity,"" or wherever.<p>Just because their 'public school' (or company or university or whatever) is considered good, doesn't necessarily mean they are good.  Conversely, not being gifted, talented, and/or a young entrepreneur doesn't make them bad.  But if you spend your time working with people falling in the former category, perhaps you <i>would</i> feel as if the latter category was missing something.  That's not criticism, it's just an observation.<p>And if they <i>are</i> missing something because of their external environment (company, private school, public school, university, or what have you), then, well, as with all analogies, the comparison eventually breaks down.  We are humans and not wild animals in captivity.  I realize that oftentimes, kids don't have a choice about what schools they go to. But, regardless, that's not really the part I thought was relevant.  My point was more that there is a good chance that the people who are unhappy in a large, corporate bureaucracy may be the same people who were unhappy in a public school.  Generally speaking, individuals have some capacity or power to change our external environment.  And if you're motivated to change your environment, chances are, you will.  Books, games, etc., are all great escapes for people/kids who are in a less than desirable (read: less than challenging) situation.  Just as start-ups are a great escape for people who are bored to tears in large, corporate bureaucracy.<p>Shrug.  I understand that there are obviously different opinions on this essay, but personally, I just don't feel that what Paul Graham wrote was an attack.",1206251017

However, I cannot recall a single class where the professor did not know my name.  Similarly, I cannot recall a single class where I didn't get to know the professor in some personal sense.<p>Particularly at such a large university, I think that some sense of personal connection with a professor is important.  Why?  Because I believe students learn better from a person with which they can emphasize.  Furthermore, in my personal experience, having an entertaining professor directly correlates with the amount of enjoyment, knowledge, and fulfillment that I feel I receive from the class.<p>Many of my professors are now on Facebook, and I wholly appreciate their effort to be accessible in ways other than email and/or office hours.",1206249736

There was something missing.<p>And yet the public school they went to is considered a good one, and from what I overheard of their conversation, they seemed smart enough.<p>...
I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that I'd only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they seemed. Particularly cheetahs. Cheetahs in the wild seem about ten times more alive. They're like different animals. And seeing those public school kids on their field trip was like seeing cheetahs in a zoo after spending several years watching them in the wild.""",1206249376

Programmers are NOBODY here, they're disposable code monkeys, and literally all startups I personally was involved in were started by polished and sleasy ""MBA types"" who regularly push engineers aside and have pictures of M3s and Porsches on their personal blogs. Needless to say, all local startups are a joke, (I won't point fingers). 
Local investors are (<i>for real</i>) interested in seeing your 10-year financial projections, P&L and all that other useless crap. When I told that to my SV-based mentor he laughed his pants off.<p>If Austin is like that, I can only imagine how pathetic the rest of the world is, and how hard it is for them to get Paul's points.<p>If Paul is not exaggerating, SV is truly unique and everybody with a CS degree should be moving down there.

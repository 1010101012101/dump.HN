6257152,comment,6256384,6256979,8,0,veidr,,,"Personally, my weighting factors are:<p>1. Number of people who died, or <i>will</i> die, weighted by <i>how</i> they die -- painful slow death by internal organ cancers being pretty far up there on my chart.<p>2. Number of people who have traumatic long term health episodes, like cancer, that degrade their quality of life. Even if it isn&#x27;t until much later.<p>3. Number of people who have to leave long-established hometown territory and give up their homes, to live in crappy housing (way better than an American FEMA trailer, but still sad) until they die.<p>4. Number of children who get thyroid cancer caused by radioactive contamination that would not have otherwise -- even though Japan has arguably the best health care system in the world, and virtually all of these kids will live. Still sucks to have cancer and surgery when you&#x27;re 8.<p>5. Incidental casualties (including cleanup workers). The actual local Fukushima plant boss became something of a hero after telling Tokyo (as in Tokyo Electric Power Company) to fuck off and calling his own shots during the worst of it. He died of cancer[1] last year, and also had a brain hemorrhage last year, ostensibly none of which was related. But there were a lot of young workers that went in there and like, did manual labor. They might be alive, but a lot of them aren&#x27;t all gonna be fine.<p>6. Degradation of the best food on earth. I read in a Seattle newspaper (I&#x27;m pretty sure) that effectively <i>all</i> tuna now commercially caught have higher levels of cesium than before Fukushima. First the mercury, now this? NO FUCK YUO!!<p>And here in Japan it&#x27;s like spinach, potatoes, meat, fish... they can only test like 0.1% of it (which is bullshit but that is another post).<p>7. And, since I am me, my <i>personal</i> standard of how fucked it was accrues bonus points for: each of the 17 times I was forced to choose between not bathing or bathing in cesium water (we did Perrier sponge baths at first but then bottled water became too scarce to use other than for drinking), the 1 time my local supermarket (high-end rich-people supermarket btw) had to hand me a letter apologizing for selling me beef with illegally high cesium levels, and the 50 hours I spent roaming Tokyo in search of clean bottled water in the aftermath.<p>I just can&#x27;t see any reality where Fukushima isn&#x27;t worse than New Horizon, on balance. Not that New Horizon wasn&#x27;t bad. It just wasn&#x27;t one of the worst disasters since I have been alive, where Fukushima was.<p>[1]: ht NO tp NO NO SORRY ://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/09/fukushima-nuclear-disaster-masao-yoshida-dead-cancer_n_3568293.html<p>[2]: Man I <i>really</i> thought I was linking to NY Times, which I will now: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/world/asia/masao-yoshida-nuclear-engineer-and-chief-at-fukushima-plant-dies-at-58.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/world/asia/masao-yoshida-n...</a><p>At least that accidental huffington link explains why my computer had been audibly churning out all sorts of sad (but unrelated) human interest stories while I typed that post....",1377179956

6257149,comment,6256384,6257089,6,0,samatman,,,"While I do think a &quot;vast number of errors and safety lapses&quot; is unlikely to come out of a cult (note the word) of engineering which embraces ritual suicide as the cost of failure...<p>This is about human psychology, rather than reliability in the engineering sense. I truly believe it would lead to better safety, but not <i>perfect</i> safety.<p>The idea is that yes, all or most of the engineers involved in a nuclear accident of any significance would kill themselves. Not only would their knowledge be lost, their fellow nuclear engineers would carve their names on a black stone, bury it in the earth beneath their corrupted stain, and never mention them again. Their families would be rewarded only if they showed honor by staying to fight the nuclear corruption, and dying honorably when the disaster is contained.<p>This won&#x27;t work perfectly, but it would let society as a whole live with the contradiction inherent in nuclear power: it sustains us, while running the risk of turning our children&#x27;s children into walking bags of cancerous mutation.<p>This is also pure thought experiment: what would it take to have a culture of safety as serious as the threat of nuclear disaster?

I don&#x27;t necessarily read that as lack of audit - more that Snowden was touching so much stuff that they have not yet managed to figure out the 1% or whatever of his accesses that resulted in the data set he shouldn&#x27;t have.<p>Or it may be that their audit system is no good (I&#x27;ve seen that claim), or that they actually do know what is taken. I imagine it&#x27;s a combination: they know for sure some of the things that were taken, they don&#x27;t know for sure what other stuff was taken, and the audit system is showing them some proportion of the take.<p>I agree about the data+keys point, that seems a dim move. Arguable legality perhaps - here in the UK, if you can&#x27;t decrypt something then you can still go to jail, but I guess at least you don&#x27;t disclose.

That category requires either a Bachelor&#x27;s degree, or some other post-secondary diploma/certificate + 3 years experience [1]. Also, the NAFTA definition of a Computer Systems Analyst specifically excludes computer programmers, so your job duties can&#x27;t consist of primarily programming.<p>I am Canadian and recently tried to enter the US under TN status as a Librarian (for fellowship as a librarian at a university library). As soon as the CBP officer saw that I had a CS Bachelor&#x27;s degree, and that I would be working with technology, he began to intensely question what my job duties would be. I was there for about 4 hours, questioned by several officers, and ultimately ended up getting denied entry because my job was going to involve too much programming in their opinion & my TN letter outlining my duties didn&#x27;t convince them otherwise.<p>I think that my situation was partly bad luck/partly a bad TN letter, but the thing to keep in mind is that they do closely follow the NAFTA handbook [2] for job descriptions/duties, and anyone working primarily with technology is much more likely to get scrutinized. So make sure if you end up getting a job offer and decide to go the TN route, that the sponsorship letter from the employer follows the guidebook description of the profession you are applying under.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what visa types other computer programmers are usually admitted under, probably H1-B generally, but I&#x27;d be interested in finding out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://canada.usembassy.gov/visas/doing-business-in-america/professions-covered-by-nafta.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://canada.usembassy.gov/visas/doing-business-in-america/...</a>

easily a PoWs life can be so bad that
maybe usually there will be little
difference.  Consider what the USSR
did to German prisoners -- marched off
to Siberia or some such and never heard
from again.  North Korea did to US
prisoners in the Korean War?  What 
North Viet Nam did to Senator McCain?<p>And our torture was water boarding,
cold rooms, loud music?<p>Your &quot;decency and respect&quot; are
asking a bit much.  Did I mention,
&quot;War is hell&quot;?<p>Supposedly at times prisoner interrogation
can yield quite useful results, but
you may be correct that from Gitmo
we didn&#x27;t get much (at least that we
didn&#x27;t already have).<p>But there is such a thing as a
<i>dumb ass clusterfuck</i>, or the older
FUBAR or SNAFU, and there&#x27;s been
a lot of that since 9/11.<p>More 
narrowly we elected W, and with
9/11 he and Cheney seemed to get all
super-hyper concerned about their
oaths of office to &quot;protect and
defend the US&quot;, paid a bit too much
attention to <i>threat scenarios</i> of
Saddam putting a nuke in a cargo
ship, sending it to a major US port
city, and setting it off, etc.
Yes, it was a difficult threat
to evaluate -- small risk of a
big loss.<p>As we know now, Saddam was talking about
WMDs mostly to scare his own people
and neighbors, and our intelligence
was so poor we didn&#x27;t know better.<p>So, W/Cheney convinced themselves that
Saddam, definitely a bloody thug,
following Stalin, was a threat to the
US and that the US should invade
and occupy Iraq and set up a 
democratic government and could do
so quickly for maybe $60 billion.
The guy who said $120 billion
or some such got fired.  The guy
who said we&#x27;d need 500,000 troops
to occupy the country got fired.<p>Did I mention clusterfuck, FUBAR,
SNAFU?  Saddam had told us that it
would be tough to hold the country
together.  We didn&#x27;t listen and, 
instead, ignited essentially 
a several sided civil war.  By the
time we put down the civil war,
likely more Iraqis had died a
violent death, from us and/or
other Iraqis, per month and in total than
at any time under Saddam.  We
killed, what, 5000+ US soldiers?
Seriously injured, what, 50,000+,
100,000+?  Blew, what, net present value
$3 trillion?  SNAFU?  FUBAR?<p>There was a lot of really sick violence.
E.g., when an angry Shiite captured
a Sunni or an angry Kurd captured a
Shiite, or an angry Sunni captured
a Kurd, etc. new chapters in torture
could be drafted.  And several US
workers where strung up from 
a bridge.<p>So Manning didn&#x27;t t like it.  Easy enough
to understand -- I didn&#x27;t like it, either.<p>But, W/Cheney were elected, about as
fairly as the US can manage.  Of really
high importance, the US Congress
authorized Gulf War II and appropriated
the money for it.  And the result was
a <i>bloody mess</i>:  The people really
badly injured were the lucky ones
because they died quickly and, thus, 
didn&#x27;t suffer as much
before they died.<p>But, that was reality.  It&#x27;s not too
difficult to see just why it happened.
It&#x27;s clearly what is likely to happen
in many situations of military action
and US national security.  It&#x27;s not
really a big surprise.  I&#x27;m sorry 
reality is like that, but in this
universe, in this solar system, on this
planet, now, that&#x27;s the case.  Heck,
there were bloody battles in the US
Civil War, Medieval wars, Roman
wars, etc.  There&#x27;s been plenty of
torture, as I recall, by some Spanish
Roman Catholics.  Again, the lucky
ones were the ones who died
quickly.  Death?  There&#x27;s been
a lot of that.  Ugly?  Once
I was reading the Bible and got
to where the pregnant women were
cut open, threw the book across
the room, and have not opened it
again since then.<p>For W/Cheney, as far as I can tell,
they were superficial,
simplistic, simple-minded,
silly, sloppy, stupid, etc. and put
in less thought and planning than
needed for a good Sunday BBQ.<p>The thing for a person to do is to try
to stay out of the way of such a huge
disaster.  That&#x27;s what Manning should
have done.<p>More generally all US mainstream 
media and all US voters should 
clearly understand that when 
a politician starts talking
passionately about &quot;protecting
the US&quot; (translation:  covering
his ass so that if something
happens don&#x27;t blame him) and US
military action in foreign lands,
firing experts with skeptical
estimates, 
&quot;to spread democracy, freedom, and
prosperity&quot;, see a big chance of
throwing away a lot of US blood
and treasure, ugly, violent deaths
of a lot of people &quot;over there&quot;,
and a really big clusterfuck,
FUBAR, SNAFU.<p>Track record:  Korean war,
mixed.  Viet Nam war, total
SNAFU, accomplished essentially
nothing good.  Gulf War I,
pushed Saddam out of Kuwait
quickly and relatively cleanly.
Gulf War II, total clusterfuck
and will likely result in just a
Saddam II in Baghdad.  Afghanistan,
smaller scale clusterfuck, essentially
nothing good.  Syria, seed of
a total clusterfuck -- just add 
military aid.
Egypt, the US supplies
the Egyptian military, and they
keep down the radical Islamists,
don&#x27;t attack Israel very much,

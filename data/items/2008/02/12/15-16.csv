114052,comment,113966,114003,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I would love to tackle this problem.  The problem is that even if you had the greatest technical solution, you would still have to sell it to big companies.  This means having a big sales force and long sales cycles, which means VC investment (in a non-sexy area, good luck).  Alternately, you could start with smaller companies that would be more reasonable to sell to, but then you'd have to bootstrap a reputation before you could sell to bigger companies, and that would take many years, also requiring VC funds.  I think it would be doable and ridiculously satisfying to succeed at, but it's a very different business, structurally, than most YCNews readers are interested in.",1202831724

Bill Clinton has tried to inject his ""charisma"" into this campaign on his wife's behalf and has not made a dent in the ""charsima gap"" between his wife and Obama.<p>Trying to compare charisma of 1992 Bill to 2008 Barack is like trying to athletes across eras.  Different issues, different prevailing attitudes among the populace, etc.",1202831360
114045,comment,113901,113901,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Dear god, if you have the people skills to manage a classroom full of teenagers, and the pedagogical skills to teach stuff, software engineering <i>needs</i> you. Can I interest you in the Drupal project? ;)<p>I know one person who used his new B.S. in Physics to Teach for America, and was unhappy. I know another person who loved to work with kids, worked for years in a science museum, then got a degree in education and worked as a high school teacher in a rural county, and is now... unhappy.<p>I think that teaching is like medicine, law, marriage counseling, postdoctoral research, and just about any other career: It's hard to know if you'll like it until you try it for real. You can't really learn what it's like, day-to-day and year-to-year, by watching from the outside. I've certainly met teachers who loved their jobs, but you have to love the reality, not the Platonic ideal in your head.<p>Honesty, if not my sense of social justice, compels me to observe that the long-term happiness of the teachers I've met has been correlated to the selectiveness of their schools -- they work at Catholic schools with tuition, magnet schools, private schools, or schools in districts where only doctors and lawyers can afford to live. I think the main reason for this is that the students in such schools are relatively well motivated: they either care about the material or care about their grades. (It's not just pay -- the Catholic school teachers I knew were paid considerably less than their public-school colleagues. But then, if you've read <i>Peopleware</i>, you could have predicted that.)<p>The happiest hacker-turned-high-school-teacher I know started off in industry, burned out after a couple of decades, then switched to teaching. You might consider that path. OTOH, the advantage of Teach for America is that it gets you in front of students (a) quickly, without having to go through as much bureaucratic hazing -- no education degree required; (b) temporarily -- you can quit in a couple years with no dishonor; and (c) when you're young, so that it will have minimal impact on your future career.",1202831269

Uninstall it first.""  However, I don't imagine there will be a ton of cases like this.<p>I do think it is a mistake that the Google Toolbar enables this by default.  Taking this power away from the website owners is not good.  And let's be honest, At least 50% of people who have the toolbar installed are not technically savvy and a good portion of them probably didn't even intend to install the software (it was bundled with another download, etc).<p>Also, I don't see a problem with the practice of putting sensitive data in GET variables if the website is protected by SSL - Am I missing something?

114039,comment,113838,114017,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>Um, okay....</i><p>Sigh. Here's where I explicate my own words. ""who actually has almost none"" references Ron Paul. Obama's charisma is similar to RP's in that much of it comes from the fact that his supporters are looking at him sideways. One instance from xkcd:<p><i>I want, for once, someone I can vote for not because I dislike the other candidate, but because Iâ€™m proud of mine. Obama is the real thing.<p>Obama has shown a real commitment to open government.</i><p>Now, the above expresses an actual <i>liking</i>, not just an agreement policy-wise. I really like Ron Paul's platform, by contrast, but frankly find him annoying. It's important to spot the difference there. Now, Munroe, who is by all accounts a smart person, is supporting Obama because of something called ""open government"", which Obama has ""real commitment"" to. I don't see this commitment in the platform, which doesn't contain any references to it:<p><a href=""http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/politics/2008/bios/view.bg?articleid=1063110"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/politics/2008/bios...</a><p>What I see in the platform is standard leftism. But even that is not where Obama's ""real commitment"" is--his real commitment is ""civil rights"", if that is understood properly.<p>Fine. It doesn't matter. The point is this: To really <i>like</i> a guy for something that is a completely negligble part of his platform is quite dangerous. I'm sure a lot of his supporters are actually supporting him for an even worse reason: Because it is the ""moral"" thing to do, in and of itself.",1202830833

114032,comment,113584,113903,0,0,raganwald,,,"Thank you. No, that is not strong enough: THANK YOU!!!<p>> It would be interesting however to measure things like the probability of your interviewers making correct decisions, or (if you use standard questions) the correlation between answers to questions and performance (in the event of a hire).<p>That was my objective when writing the post, although judging by responses on reddit, most people thought I was saying that naive bayesian filters could outperform human hiring managers.<p>All I was suggesting is that people ""Apply what we know about classification to hiring."" And one of the things we know is that <i>any</i> classifier--human or machine or human assisted by machine--can be improved by regular investigation of the correlation between the features you observe and the results you obtain.<p>> The real problem with resumes however is that anyone can put absolutely anything on it.<p>True, although security by obscurity works for hiring. It's a lot more like CAPTCHAs than it is like Spam: if you are the only one who thinks that Io and Self language experience correlates positively with performance as a Javascript programmer, I think you will find that Io and Self are keywords that will maintain a high correlation.<p>Then one day Joel Spolsky writes a post about that, someone reads it and puts it in a job listing, a head hunter sees it and adds it to some candidate resumes, and within a year the correlation drops off the map and you have to start looking for something else in resumes or you have to aggressively fizzbuzz it in phone screens.<p>C'est la vie.",1202829618

It was simple, the 404 page would check to see if the requested url was the bad link sent via email, if it was, it would redirect to the appropriate page. If not, we'd show a 404 page.<p>Worked great in FF but totally broke in IE7. Why? Because the 404 page size was under 1Kb, IE7 decided that our 404 page wasn't informative enough and supplied it's own.<p>The solution, as stupid as it sounds was to add enough white space to the file until it was larger than 1Kb.<p>And, you know, also stop sending broken links out.",1202829407

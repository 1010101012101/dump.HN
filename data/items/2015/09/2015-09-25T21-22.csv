Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember names at the moment to even google it, but supposedly some saddles were stolen and someone was hired to get them back. He ran around shooting people on the brand of saddles that had been stolen. More saddles were returned to the seller than had been stolen. Even people who had actually purchased one no longer wanted to be seen sitting on one.<p>So I realize the law does not technically make it illegal to have your aunt visit. But if the effect is that you might get sued, the de facto outcome might be that you stop letting relatives come visit if you live in SF because the risk involved in doing something completely legal is nonetheless too high.",1443218350

As the people who control production want this, trying to fight this charity and whatnot is considered a waste of time - the people who control production want unemployment and poverty to be at a certain level, and if the working class makes a massive effort to relieve it one place, the controllers of production will just increase it elsewhere.<p>You can see this in its modern form by reading the Wall Street Journal, Businessweek etc. in the year 2000.  There were worries the unemployment rate had gotten &quot;too low&quot; (<4%), i.e. it was a problem too many people looking for a job could find one.  Talks of inflation and so forth, basically the WSJ-speak way which can easily be translated into Marxist terminology.<p>If the powers that be were openly seeking to increase unemployment in 2000, what is the point of devoting a lot of effort to charity?

These are called &quot;supply&quot; and &quot;demand&quot; and they govern price. SF has not been keeping up with it&#x27;s infrastructure, is a decade behind in new construction, and building new resedential properties will take ~5-10 years to complete. They are not actively building properties that will sufficiently meet demand even now. So this won&#x27;t go away.<p>Unfortunately, people who paid a lot for houses have a vested interest in not raising supply, and the amount of regulation surrounding new construction creates massive amounts of friction.

You will see that it makes it impossible to have the harness at a safe orientation for the driver yet allow a rear passenger. Also when you add the cross bar as it also required, it is now unsafe for a rear passenger.<p>Further any car with a cage has other compromises and some of those reasons for a cage are for things like being able to quickly jack the car up and rigidity (not just safety) but limits how people can enter and exit for example.<p>A harness is just not a good fit for a street car.

In practice, it&#x27;s carefully thought out to avoid edge cases. The general idea is something like this:<p><pre><code>   when first activated, the
   phone generates a random 256-bit AES key

   phone uses this random AES key to encrypt
   all data stored on the phone

   phone retains this random key in a special
   location, and encrypts this key by using
   the user-provided PIN

To quickly erase all data on the phone, all that&#x27;s necessary is to overwrite the key in the special location with random data. From that point on, there is no feasible way to recover anything on the phone. Period.<p>It isn&#x27;t necessary to erase an entire device. It&#x27;s merely necessary to replace a 32-byte field (that contains the true AES key) with 32-bytes of random data.<p>From then on, it doesn&#x27;t matter what the PIN is. Data on the phone is jibberish unless and until the proper 256-bit AES key is produced. That key no long exists, so from that point on the only way to recover the data is by brute forcing AES, by trying all possible 2^256 combinations.<p><i>They look like you had a bunch of things and then erased them</i><p>No, what remains is indistinguishable from the case where the correct PIN hasn&#x27;t been provided.

Anything which escapes out of an expression is copied, so there is no reference graph.<p>Copying objects to avoid lifetime computations is far, far from novel. It is ancient. Think about all the C program modules that use strdup on strings that are passed around, over the place, so that they can then `free` their copy with confidence that nobody else has a pointer to it. In C++, there are smart pointers for one-reference only, like std::unique_ptr. (Long before that became standard, C++ coders did similar things from scratch.)<p>Stack allocation of temporaries which go away when a stack frame is blown away is certainly not new. The implementor of NewLisp just had to look to the implementation language C to get this idea.<p>Mature Lisp implementations have this as a built-in optimization in their compilers. That is to say, recognizing non-escaping temporary objects and optimizing their reclamation, and even allocating them on the stack. ANSI Common Lisp also has the (declare (dynamic-extent ...)) declaration to manually request, or suggest that this may be done with an object. (The programmer promises not to let that object escape, and in return, the implementation can stack-allocate it.)<p>NewLisp&#x27;s claim is that the memory managent is novel in <i>interpreters</i> (because the author knows that Lisp <i>compilers</i> can identify temporary objects that don&#x27;t need to be retained past the evaluation of their containing expression).  Is it really novel? It might be true of the limited number of interpreters that the author knows about.  If we were to exhaustively research the history of computing, we&#x27;d probably find other interpreted languages with copying memory management. Oh, here is one: GNU Bash. Look for uses of the function copy_word_list in the Bash sources.  GNU Bash seems to be implementing &quot;ORO&quot; memory management for lists of strings passed around as arguments and other structures.",1443215965

I suspect part of the reason for that is because in modern culture, most people spend their waking hours in one of two modes: 1) Working (aka earning money) or 2) Consuming (aka spending money). When people win the lottery, a lot of them quit their jobs. They now have an extra 40+ hours per week that they need to somehow occupy themselves. They think of themselves as &quot;rich,&quot; so they spend those hours consuming (spending money) instead of engaging in low cost/creative hobbies, like cooking, gardening, sewing, etc.<p>As our income has gone up, one of the side effects is that we want bigger homes, more clothes, etc etc etc. If you tried to recreate the lifestyle of, say, 1950s America, with a modest home and home cooked meals (etc), you could probably drastically reduce the number of hours needed to support yourself -- assuming you could find ways to fill your time that didn&#x27;t involve pissing away the money you do have.<p>Most people do not have that kind of self discipline. That isn&#x27;t something policy will create. That isn&#x27;t something an app will create. There are ways to shape policy to make more small scale, affordable housing available. But, for the most part, making this happen on a large scale and not just for the occasional quirky individual (as it currently happens) would involve somehow radically altering the world&#x27;s culture.<p>As much as I think it would be awesome if people in the world generally had more free time hand-in-hand with more financial security, I have significant reservations about the wisdom of attempting to convince people to do what it would take to make this happen. That tends to be in the morality/religion/ethics/culture area and that is very dangerous ground to tread. Historically, it has tended to be the domain of religious figures, many of whom ended up dead at a young age via methods like crucifixion or being burnt at the stake.",1443215833

It&#x27;s a reasonable alternative to XMPP and has a massive userbase. The clients are pretty horrible but that might be completely unrelated to how good the protocol is (Note: I have no idea how good it is. Because it&#x27;s closed source.).<p>I was hopeful for a while but I don&#x27;t really see it happening anymore :( Oh well...<p>Edit: Oh and the worst part: Communication is just one side of that coin. The other side is identity and it&#x27;s one hell of a side. OpenID was a disaster. Mozilla got it mostly right with Persona but completely botched the marketing and has all but given up on it now. There is no decent foss protocol for identity/authentication today other than Persona, and nobody is working on one. There was a time indeed where I could&#x27;ve pictured Google working on solving this just for the hell of it. Just because it would improve the world. That Google is gone, and there&#x27;s nobody with the appropriate reach that seems willing to do it now.",1443214918

There is no standard -- it depends if the manufacturer put a weak pull-up or pull-down into the chip, or if they have an active termination that will pull to either end. Or if the gate isn&#x27;t designed any particular way, it could be subject to how well doped the transistors of that particular chip turned out.  Being open also means it is subject to noise from adjacent signals, so it could be random that way, too.",1443214873

I see the symbol &#x27;cat&#x27; and both the memory-complex representing a cat and the audio complex representing the spoken version of the symbol will be activated. That&#x27;s how memory associations work. The written version of the symbol and the spoken version of the symbol will be strongly associated, because they represent the same concept.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean I have to wait for the audio to finish playing before I move on to the next symbol. That&#x27;s a misconception of what&#x27;s actually happening.<p>(Plus, of course, hardly anyone reads a word at a time. It&#x27;s nearly always complete phrases. Frequently not even in the right order.)<p>> If you read much poetry, you&#x27;ll see that the connection between reading and sound is pretty inseparable.<p>Well, no.

I&#x27;ve bookmarked your essay for future reference.<p>Something that doesn&#x27;t get talked about too much, that I worry about, is the <i>massive</i> amount of duplication of work effort that happens as a result of this hyperchurn in software architectures. For an industry that relies on terms and phrases like &quot;NIH&quot; and &quot;premature optimization&quot; and &quot;great programmers reuse&quot; to emphasize the importance of productivity, a huge amount of effort is spent every year building out libraries and frameworks and languages to replace previous libraries and frameworks and languages that largely did the same thing.<p>Probably the finest example of this is is CPAN. Perl <i>still</i> has one of the largest community-managed repository of libraries of any other language (probably C or C++ or similar has got it beat). Any software developer in 2015 that decides Perl is just too antiquated to use and wants to move a large Perl codebase to, say, Node.js, now has to either rewrite those libraries or find libraries that have already been rewritten by someone else.<p>If Node (for example) were the only major new language since Perl, I could see how maybe the initial investment in effort to duplicate all of Perl&#x27;s functionality might pay off if Node offers a significant enough improvement in productivity in the long term. But, since Perl there&#x27;s been PHP, Python, Ruby, Node, Go, to name a few, and each of those have had their own competing frameworks ... we simply aren&#x27;t gaining enough in long-term productivity when each new language or framework is being replaced within a couple of years by another new language or framework.<p>I have a hunch that a lot of this is a result of a competitive software developer job market. Newer and younger developers, lacking the background and experience of older greybeards, migrate towards newer technologies as a way to differentiate themselves. They eventually get hired into management roles (in startups, this can happen very quickly), where they have the freedom to operate their own fiefdoms, and they quickly establish rules of software architecture that ensure they get to hire other young developers that are comfortable with the latest trend.<p>It can seem a little bit absurd, but fortunately I&#x27;m not seeing many signs that this is happening that much yet outside of the HN & startup microcosm.",1443214839

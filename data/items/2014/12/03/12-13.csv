8693462,comment,8691340,8691340,0,0,codingdave,,,"Resumes are just a tool to decide whether or not to start a conversation.<p>When hiring, you are not really concerned about letting a good candidate go. There will always be others. It is far more dangerous to let a poor candidate in. And poor candidates tend to be poor due to cultural and subject matter issues more than basic technical chops.<p>I&#x27;m not making any hiring decisions at this point - just weeding a huge list of names down to a reasonable number to actually call. So I&#x27;m not judging people&#x27;s skill levels yet -- I&#x27;m looking for something in their history that tells me they are bringing more to the table than knowing how to code. I don&#x27;t even have preconceived notions of what that might be - just something that sparks me to think their experience has something in common with what we do. We&#x27;ll weed out the weak technical candidates in an initial call, then continue with the people who are both strong technically and a good fit for the work and the culture.<p>So the whole premise that I am not getting it &quot;right&quot; when judging a person skill based on their resume is missing the point. It isn&#x27;t that I don&#x27;t care... but I know reading a resume won&#x27;t give me an accurate answer, so it isn&#x27;t even a piece of the decision making criteria yet.",1417611498

They are one time costs and with the internet they are becoming very cheap already.</i><p>Maybe you didn&#x27;t mean it the way it sounds, but I think any author cares about what their reader gets, and if I buy something I certainly care about its quality. I know for a fact that no matter how much effort I put into writing a book, there are always things that can be improved because I missed something I didn&#x27;t know, or didn&#x27;t know about a particular design or grammatical principle, or simply made a mistake. More eyeballs make a better product, and eyeballs cost money.<p>Breaking it down: Let&#x27;s say I write a 1200 page technical book. Roughly speaking, services charge on a pages-per-day rate. Sake of argument, let&#x27;s guess 250 pages per day for proofreading, 100 per day for graphical layout and enhancement, 150 per day for technical review. That&#x27;s roughly 20 days, for which we could elance out separately for $100 per day. That&#x27;s $2000. Up front.<p>...which brings me to my next point.<p><i>The important number is copies_sold X my_income_per_copy. Publishers might raise one of the number 2-5x but lower the other to 1/10.</i><p>I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re estimating with these values (which is OK, because I&#x27;m estimating too). However, a quick look at Amazon and other online bookstores shows that ebooks tend to sell for a fraction of the price of paper books. $1.21 seems to be a common price point, and even for more expensive books (for which there is already a large demand) the price point seems to be about half that of a paper book.<p>Continuing our assumptions, let&#x27;s say a published book sells 10,000 copies. Assuming the self-published book is 50% as popular as an equivalent published book (your most generous estimate) and therefore sells 5,000 copies, it still looks like 90% of a smaller price (let&#x27;s say $1.21, so a total of $5,445 from 90% of 5000 * $1.21) works out at <i>less</i> than 10% of the larger value (assuming the parent post&#x27;s assumption of $1 per copy, so 10,000 * $1). All handwavy values based on various people&#x27;s assumptions of popularity, but useful for a starting point.<p>Now, back to the one time costs: When compared to my $5,445, that $2,000 sounds really bad now, doesn&#x27;t it?",1417610985

For those of us who have worked in DSP, either using it or implementing new things with it, there&#x27;s s highly mathematical reason to record the source of you audio with a higher sample rate than what the author suggests is a generous maximum.<p>It has to do with waveforms and how continuous they are. So, for starters, true, if you have a perfectly continuous wave form, at 22K, then your sample rate must be at least 44K. In fact, with sample rate of 44k you can perfectly discretize a continuous wave form, like a sine wave.<p>Does you see the problem with this? Sounds are not always continuous! If you look at the waveform of a violin, distorted guitar, cymbal, etc... They&#x27;re very jagged. To effectively approximate these analog waveforms as a finite set of sums you need a much higher sample rate. It makes s HUGE difference, trust me.<p>So basically, technically speaking, 44K works just five if you only listen to music made by orjan pipes and penny whistles, but most sounds are very complicated, and to be properly captured you actually need a higher sample rate. It&#x27;s simple and mathematical. Also, this whole &quot;44.1K is all you need and if you don&#x27;t agree with me then you&#x27;re dumb and don&#x27;t understand math&quot; ra ra ra has been going on all over the Internet for ages, and while u appreciate the motivations that people may have, it gets a little annoying. Basically, instead of immediately jumping to the conclusion that people&#x27;s ears are wrong, maybe the more patient and mindful approach is to ask oneself, &quot;why does my mathematical knowledge of a subject fall short of explaining what many people seem to experience?&quot;.<p>Note: everything I said was regarding the source of capturing a sound. There&#x27;s an entire science behind compression and all that sauce.<p>Also Stanford&#x27;s DSP lectures (available online) explain this much more indepth, albeit abstractly.",1417610752

8693324,comment,8692168,8692719,0,0,briandear,,,"Consumers have a defense with private markets -- use the competition. The problem with regulated public markets, such as taxis in NYC, is that a consumer has little choice, thus, unless they want to spend hours of their time dealing with an inherited embedded and political bureaucracy, there&#x27;s little alternative. It&#x27;s like restaurants, the bad ones tend to go out of business eventually. But imagine if restaurants all sucked and they were enabled in their suck by a government imposed &quot;medallion&quot; system and a supply of those medallions not controlled by market demand but by the restaurant mafia themselves, then there isn&#x27;t any alternative, so your stuck with inferior quality and impossible barriers to entry controlled by your competition. Removing barriers to competition is the absolute best way to improve a market. Prices drop, service has to also improve. Those that perform a bad service at a high price quickly die because, if I don&#x27;t like it, I can easily choose a substitute. Restaurants are a great example. You certainly want some level of regulation, but only the minimum amount to protect the health of the public. So in the public transport area, background checks should be required, insurance should be required, safety inspections should be required, but silliness like taxi medallions ought to be eliminated. To be clear, I am not against regulations, but I am against market regulation. There is a subtle but important difference.",1417609595

An interesting thing to think about, but you do have to actually think.<p>> Highly optimizing compilers aren&#x27;t worth the risk.<p>If they were buggy, sure. But, probably through the weight of every single developer using them for absolutely everything, the bugs have been ironed out.<p>> Something is wrong if most programs don&#x27;t run instantaneously.<p>Why? Do a straight-up cost/benefit analysis. How much extra would you pay for a program that ran twice as fast? If anything I&#x27;d expect people pay more for bigger programs that take longer to run, since they feel like they&#x27;re doing something important.<p>> Design applications as small executables that communicate.<p>The microservices people are sort of doing this. It&#x27;s a great way to turn all your problems into distributed problems. And what&#x27;s not set up is any sensible way to send even basic data structures around. &quot;pipes and sockets&quot; send streams of bytes. In 2014, if I want to send an object, a function even - heck, if I want to send an inert struct - from one process to another, I&#x27;m basically stuck. The least-bad option is probably to write out the object definition in Thrift IDL, generate a bunch of code and then write a bunch more code to map back and forth with my actual program datatypes. It&#x27;s hard to express quite how much it sucks, but many people have tried and failed to come up with something better.<p>> Don&#x27;t write temporary files to disk, ever.<p>If you&#x27;re building new executables for everything you&#x27;re either doing something wrong, or you don&#x27;t care about the space you&#x27;re wasting. The right way to do these tiny tweaks is in an interactive, workbooky environment like ipython. If you like that style of programming.<p>> Everything is so complex that you need to isolate yourself from as many libraries and APIs as possible.<p>Absolutely backwards. Everything is so complex - and using libraries so easy - that you should use libraries for everything. A good library provides a simpler interface than the things it&#x27;s built on top of, so you can just call e.g. encrypt(data) rather than doing thousands of lines of bit-twiddling.",1417608453

So, things like cigar, pipe, and hookah shops can allow indoor smoking, but virtually no bar in the city can.  (Who, by law, must put a sign up indicating a majority of sales come from the sale of alcohol for consumption on-premise.  You can&#x27;t have both a majority of sales from alcohol and from tobacco at the same time, so cigar bars all had to create patios.)<p>These laws are not loosely enforced in the city, to the extent that there is a team of bureaucrats tasked with enforcing action in regards to complaints.  However, whether or not every customer reports infractions, is a different story. =)",1392134304

Let me explain.\nAn email to your legislators may result in a form letter response and a phone call to the office may amount to a tally mark on an administrative assistant&#x27;s notepad.\nBut, if you want to get their attention, a letter to the editor published in one of your state&#x27;s 5-10 biggest newspapers that mentions them specifically BY NAME is the way to go.<p>That is the crucial thing to know--the rest of this comment is an explanation of why I know this is true.\nI know this because, when I interned in the D.C. office of a senator one summer, one of the duties I shared was preparing a document that was distributed internally both online and in paper format. This document was made every day and comprised world news articles, national news, state news, and any letters to the editor in the 5-10 largest newspapers within the senator&#x27;s home state that mentioned him by name. I was often the person who put that document on his desk, and it was the first thing he read every morning after arriving to the office.<p>I began to suspect that this was standard operating procedure because several other senators&#x27; offices share the same printer in the basement of the Russell Senate Office building, and I saw other interns doing the exact same procedures that I was involved in.\nSince the internship, I&#x27;ve conferred with other Senate and House employees past and present and determined that most--if not all--offices use essentially the same procedure.<p>Edit:\nI don&#x27;t mean to suggest that calling or emailing your legislators is worthless. It isn&#x27;t--it&#x27;s just not the most effective route to getting their attention. However, if you don&#x27;t have the time to writer a letter to the editor, please consider at least calling or emailing them. In fact, there&#x27;s no reason why you couldn&#x27;t use multiple tactics by calling them, emailing them, and writing a letter to the editor.\nIf you would like to go the call or email route, tools to help with that can be found at <a href=""https://thedaywefightback.org/&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thedaywefightback.org/&quot;</a>",1392134016

A huge portion of those neighborhoods are hispanic, and there are many majority-African American neighborhoods with low crime stats as well.<p>It is possible that your friends who live in Chicago don&#x27;t realize this, because what is also true about Chicago is that the 20-something hipster demographic lives almost exclusively in just a few neighborhoods on the north and near northwest sides.",1392133857

7218125,comment,7216471,7216471,7,0,arca_vorago,,,"The irony to me is that they have two of the worst offenders when it comes to mass surveillance advertised on the side of the page. Facebook and Google, despite their attempts to say they weren&#x27;t aware of the NSA gaining access to their info, are probably just as much of a threat to privacy as the NSA total information awareness.<p>It goes like this: let the private companies run wild when it comes to privacy violations, and then gobble up all their data via national security letters, subpoenas, secret taps via NSA tech, and warrants for higher profile stuff and then only if desperate, and that is assuming an adversarial nature between the private sector and the government. In fact the C-levels are often directly approached and goaded into silently and secretly cooperating. (and if they refuse, ala Quest, they get targeted by the system)<p>Of course there is the matter that it is governments who will take the surveillance information and then act upon it, making them the slightly more evil evil in the room, but that does not negate the issue of private sector mass surveillance that is for sale to the highest bidder.<p>I&#x27;ve been one of those who has ranted about the dangers of the NSA since the late 90&#x27;s, and now that it&#x27;s a mainstream issue, it seems to have taken on a &quot;oh yeah, the NSA is bad! stop that surveillance&quot; kind of hipster social wave that lacks any kind of detailed nuance or explores the origins and destinations of this admittedly huge issue.<p>Yes, the surveillance is unconstitutional. So have been many of the other activities our American oligarchic powers have been engaged in over the past decade, including the assassination of American citizens without due process.<p>All of these things point to a much more deeply rooted issue than simply &quot;surveillance&quot;, namely, that our fundamental governmental structure is in ruins as a result of a combination of corruption and apathy that has gutted the already precariously positioned checks and balances system.<p>Russ Tice has said he held in his hand the wiretap papers for a then hopeful senator from IL, who happens to now be in the Whitehouse. Are we really so naive as to think that Obama is clean coming from such a notoriously corrupt political arena? The intelligence agencies have been using the same techniques for ages, namely, bribery and threats. Russ Tice has also said he held in his hands the papers for judges who now sit on the SCOTUS, and FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds has a source who was responsible for vetting potential judges (up to SCOTUS level), and according to her, he said that anytime a judge came up clean, he was immediately removed from the roster of potentials. The implication being that only controllable people are allowed.<p>The point is that all three branches of government are corrupt and no longer (if ever, don&#x27;t mistake that phrase for golden day idealism) functioning as servants of the people and defenders of the constitution (I wonder what the legal importance of oaths really is these days, because I seem to be surrounded by oath-breakers(USMC combat vet)).<p>And of the three branches, it is the executive which lords it&#x27;s power over the other two.<p>The really sad part is that it seems to be the private sector which lords power of the executive. This is the trail of breadcrumbs that truly concerned people need to start discussing, researching, and following. It&#x27;s very difficult to do. It&#x27;s hard to track down the global supranational corporate structure.

That is how we gain control of our data back... but that&#x27;s becoming more and more difficult.<p>Honestly, I think RMS was simply a man far ahead of his time, and the history books (if he isn&#x27;t wiped from their pages) will refer to him as a visionary in a sea of overly pragmatic corporatists who failed to see the big picture.<p>I could go on quite a bit about this, but that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll leave it for now.",1392133720

If you screw up with a washing machine, even a super dumbed down one, the stakes could be a lot higher; try explaining to your wife how you ruined her $200 (or even $2000) dress because she spilled spaghetti sauce on it and so you pushed the &quot;very dirty&quot; button.<p>In a sense, I think that washing machines are so popular and there is such a wide variety of them because they do a very good job of selling a lie, and that lie is something like, &quot;I will make it so that you do not have to think when you do laundry.&quot;  People who have to interact with these machines tend to realize that this is a lie pretty early on, and that no, you still have to think to use the machine.  However, the sheer magnitude of things they have to think about (colors, material, water temperature, volume, intensity of spinning, detergent, surfactant) can be overwhelming.  When coupled with the fact that there is usually no good, solid guide that you can just read and go &quot;Oh, now I know exactly how to wash all of my clothes and have no fear that they will get ruined!&quot; and the fact that the washing machine is still sitting there, whispering that lie at you, that this should be easy because you have a washing machine, the cognitive dissonance can get pretty strong.  At the same time, it&#x27;s subtle enough that we usually don&#x27;t realize that if we took a couple of hours to study it and better understand how these things work we&#x27;d probably be fine.  So instead we cautiously try to find a couple of collections of settings that work pretty well for most of our stuff.  Once we find them then we stick with those programs and usually it works out pretty well, but there&#x27;s still that tiny fear in the back of our minds that maybe this time will be the one where something goes Horribly, Horribly Wrong.",1392132920

And if they don&#x27;t, then what?  We get some feel-good legislation which purports to solve the situation but really just plants the seeds of the next great abuse.  That&#x27;s exactly what happened with FISA.<p>The current battleground <i>is not on Capitol Hill.</i>  it is in the insistence that we make companies pay for what they are doing with the NSA and insist on the development of secure alternatives.<p>The next battleground (as we make gains in private industry) will be in Capitol Hill, and believe me, when it comes, we will need business interests to be on our side.",1392132408

7218004,comment,7205868,7216961,1,0,e12e,,,"> Higher Education. In Sweden, women dominate every area of higher education except engineering.<p>I&#x27;m not as familiar with Sweden as I am with Norway, but AFAIK there is being work done to increase equality in higher education. As an example we try to increase recruitment of women to computer science, and men to biology.<p>> Job preferences. Women tend to outperform men in the general desirability of occupations, as measured by the Cambridge Social Interaction and Stratification Scale. Unpopular jobs and thankless job (plumbers, janitors, road workers) tend to be men dominated professions. Women’s occupations are healthier, permit greater access to higher status networks, and involve working with better educated people than men’s occupations.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with studies supporting the idea that women in general have healthier work than men: In general women are overrepresented as nurses, cleaners and hair dressers[1] -- all of which tend to have a high degree of sick leave.<p>I would also like to see some citations regarding &quot;access to higher status networks&quot; -- most studies/statistics I&#x27;m familiar with suggests that even in rather equal societies, like Norway, women are under-represented in leading roles. Additionally even in traditionally female dominated sectors, like nursing, often men will hold the leading positions.<p>At any rate, feminst do work for higher female recruitment to construction and other traditionally male dominated professions. To be sure, the motivation isn&#x27;t &quot;to get women into thankless jobs&quot;, or increase their exposure to less healthy working conditions, but rather to promote equal opportunity and choice when it comes to careers.<p>The &quot;humanist&quot; side of the coin wrt working conditions, is of course to work for all workers to have better working conditions.<p>I&#x27;m a little surprised to see plumbing and road work grouped with cleaning -- but perhaps that can explain why road work is much more expensive in Norway than in Sweden.<p>[1] Hairdressers tend to stand a lot, often on hard floors, and are also exposed to chemicals that disturbingly harmful. There&#x27;s recently been more awareness around the stuff used to treat and colour hair -- some of which contain substances that have long since become highly regulated when used in construction.",1392132385

It also looks like what happens when a network connection becomes saturated: Performance doesn&#x27;t drop off linearly, it drops off much faster.<p>Netflix and Comcast/Verizon don&#x27;t have enough bandwidth between them to support subscriber demand and Netflix&#x27;s high bit rate streams at peak hours. There are three obstacles to improving that:<p>- Somebody&#x27;s got to pay for bigger interconnect. This is actually the cheapest part, and Netflix would be happy to forgo the interconnect by putting a few boxes loaded with video cache on Comcast&#x27;s or Verizon&#x27;s networks.<p>- Somebody&#x27;s got to pay for the added bandwidth on Comcast and Verizon&#x27;s networks to push these video packets to subscribers. Well, duh, Comcast and Verizon should, right? Except now they&#x27;re at the mercy of Netflix, who can keep loading on subscribers and upping the bit rate until a substantial fraction of home broadband subscribers are trying to pull 10Mbit constantly from 7pm-12am EST. Comcast and Verizon are not thrilled to have to pay for this, especially when it&#x27;s unclear how they benefit.<p>- And of course: Netflix is in direct competition with Verizon and Comcast&#x27;s own &quot;OTA&quot; TV and video on demand services. Every dollar Comcast and Verizon spend to make Netflix more appealing for their subscribers is a dollar they&#x27;re spending encouraging those same subscribers to cancel or scale back their expensive TV packages.",1392131991

Built with the aim of tackling a 2.5 trillion dollar financing gap for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) around the world, EFL&#x27;s digital psychometric credit assessment evaluates small business owners on key elements of entrepreneurship in a scalable and automated manner. This breakthrough technology helps banks provide financing to market segments previously out of reach, and helps bring the developing world&#x27;s most capable, yet previously unbankable, entrepreneurs into the formal financial fold. After spinning off from a research initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Center for International Development, EFL now works with leading financial institutions across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and has facilitated over $240 million in lending to SMEs. We’ve been recognized and endorsed by leading development organizations such as the IFC, Inter-American Development Bank, and the G-20.<p>---<p>About the Fellowship:<p>The two-year Global Technology Fellowship provides an opportunity for young, driven individuals with a background in computer science and software engineering to gain exposure to a quickly growing and highly accredited startup in the field of emerging market technology. Your mission will be to tackle engineering challenges at the intersection of data science and software development.  We are re-engineering our infrastructure and will need help in designing for growth.  The Fellowship will be based in Lima, Peru and Boston, MA for the duration of the first year, and you will also have the opportunity to engage with EFL clients in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. We at EFL view first-hand exposure to emerging markets as an essential component of the fellowship and guarantee at least six weeks of on the ground experience within your first year.<p>Projects you may be asked to take on in your first year are:<p>Web Development\n•      Enhancements to the EFL Web App to meet new customer feature needs (Django and JQuery)\n•      Implementation of automated continuous integration (Git, Jenkins, and AWS)<p>Scoring Systems\n•      Enhancements to support faster asynchronous scoring and reporting needs (Celery)\n•      Enhancements to async infrastructure configuration to support redundancy (AWS and Celery)<p>UX/UI Projects\n•      Android Mobile tools development (Android)\n•      Enhancements to the EFL Web App (Django/CSS/XHTML)<p>R&D Projects\n•      Mobile, GIS, and Social scoring enhancements to the core EFL algorithm (NoSQL, R)<p>Client Integration Projects\n•      Enhancements to the EFL REST API (Python) \n•      Client integration projects (varies)<p>Based on your contributions in your first year,  EFL will offer you a position for a second and final year of the fellowship. This position may be a continuation of one of the projects you worked on in year one, or it may be a new opportunity in one of our global markets. Your success in both years of the fellowship will depend on your ability to learn quickly in situations that are foreign, to think critically through complex challenges, to take initiative as opportunities present themselves, and to execute efficiently and effectively.<p>Additional Fellowship Opportunities:<p>As a Global Technology Fellow, you will have the opportunity to engage with EFL’s senior leadership to gain exposure to other areas of the business including sales, project management, credit modeling and statistics.  You’ll be joining a tight-knit corps of EFL Fellows with an array of skillsets and shared ambitions in the field of emerging market technology, and will have access to leading practitioners of development economics. Fellows are highly encouraged to utilize these resources during their time with EFL.

Both have units on debugging, both in Eclipse and independently of an IDE. We teach students proper testing fundamentals, how to use the debugger, and how bottom-up design can make debugging much simpler.<p>However, it&#x27;s up to the students to actually use these tools and techniques to figure out why they&#x27;re so much more effective than print statements. (After all, could you imagine taking French while never having to speak or listen? Piano while never touching an instrument? Same principle here.) Some students will learn to use these tools quickly, but others can still logic through these courses.<p>However, everyone eventually learns. Take CIS 380, our operating systems class. The final project involves building a simulation OS with kernel, scheduler, file system, shell, etc. Pretty much all system calls aside from read, write, malloc, and free are written from scratch. Even for the hotshots that didn&#x27;t need to learn how to debug, they eventually learn to use gdb, because you simply can&#x27;t logic your way through several thousand lines of C, even if you did write them all yourself.<p>Any computer science or engineering curriculum that doesn&#x27;t teach debugging fundamentals does students a disservice. However, we can&#x27;t directly force students to practice these skills. It&#x27;s up to them to try applying these techniques.",1392131427

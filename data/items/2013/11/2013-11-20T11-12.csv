Adobe got breached and your data got leaked, you&#x27;ll likely whine a little about it online but unless you are willing to:<p>- shift your work and relearn a new tool than Photoshop<p>- navigate your way around closing your account (with the assumption that your data is <i>actually</i> deleted after account closure) which is rather hard in most cases, no one likes losing users.<p>Then you&#x27;ll likely just suck it up, do what you can and hope for the best.<p>On the other hand, you got small time (but growing - not web-scale yet-) services/products that can&#x27;t really afford losing a large number of users. Those would worry most about security. Ironically, they&#x27;d stay off the grid for long enough and wont become attack targets until they make it big.<p>But that&#x27;s just really the security industry, no system is 100% secure. And you never know if you&#x27;ve tightened your security enough until someone drills a hole. Then you patch it.<p>Any self respecting corporate will have a security auditing policy. The so called white-hat hackers or pen-testers. Good companies will run security audits every now and then in hope to discover new security holes introduced by software updates, system policy changes...etc.<p>As for legal pressure, it depends on what we are talking about.

6767437,comment,6765975,6766536,11,0,TheZenPsycho,,,"Hey, have you ever seen this thing called etherpad? it&#x27;s pretty great. Some guys even took the research put into that and made a library anyone can use called shareJS[1]. It uses operational transforms, and yes, they&#x27;re pretty hairy.. but they&#x27;ve been done, and now anyone can use that work.<p>Then you have the persistent data structures from clojure. Now I might be crazy, but it seems to me that those data structures are probably the most valuable contributions that language has made to our craft, and make the sort of things you&#x27;re talking about-- not trivial, but a lot easier.<p>The whole trick is you have to start thinking 4-dimensionally- Which is difficult because our programming languages tend to have modify-in-place mutable state, when what we should have is variables that remember what they were at specific times, and algorithms that are able to merge conflicts seamlessly- not by locking but by recreating what would have happened if the two events had happened synchronously on the same system.<p>But then, you only really have to do that if what you&#x27;re talking about is a multiuser system. You can do all this much easier if what you&#x27;re willing to build is a simpler system. One that works like a one page JS app- JUST LIKE A DESKTOP APP, and only talks to the server at the point of &quot;saving&quot; or &quot;synchronising&quot; or whatever you want to call it. That&#x27;s easy. You just program undo just like you do in a desktop app, and what you save to the server is a serialised history.<p>On the server, you have your git-like versioned databases for maximum undo. We know this can work because dropbox does it. If I delete a file on my machine... like REALLY delete it, dropbox still has it for 30 days.<p>Wikipedia articles have &quot;infinite&quot; undo.<p>And that&#x27;s all web. that&#x27;s all internats.<p>Fundamentally, once you have javascript, the html5 appcache, localStorage, what is the difference between the &quot;web app&quot; and the &quot;native app&quot; other than performance and some other native features irrelevant to undo?<p>the mobile apps still have to phone home to a server too now. Half the apps on the app store don&#x27;t work without a net connection. What is the actual difference?<p>In fact, you could write a whole app that just downloads to the phone, runs entirely locally, doesn&#x27;t talk to the server after the initial download, and runs in a browser. Why couldn&#x27;t you have undo in that?<p>Well, why not. so I added it to my app pix.pe[2] when you press the back button. not exactly the most impressive example since you don&#x27;t have much state to store... but what&#x27;s the difference between doing it there, and doing the same thing in a native app? it&#x27;s all just turing complete language code, with a storage mechanism and a way to draw on screen. Once you have those things there&#x27;s nothing to stop you. Other than undo itself being kind of difficult already, regardless of what platform you&#x27;re writing into.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://sharejs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sharejs.org/</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"http://pix.pe/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pix.pe/</a>",1384947096

Their argument rests on the assumption that if a known terrorist is in contact with a US person and there is reason to believe that US person is in the US for nefarious purposes, then they may already be moving to attack somewhere and the NSA needs his call records ahead of time.  They want to know what other foreigners is he in contact with, are they known terrorists, are the people in the US that he&#x27;s talking to also talking with each other (which could indicate a terrorist cell), etc.  Answer these questions, package up the information and shoot it over to the FBI for follow-up investigation.<p>If they didn&#x27;t have the records ahead of time, the NSA or the FBI would have to get a warrant, submit the warrant to all N of the major phone providers, wait for however long it takes them to process it, get responses from N-1 providers that the phone number doesn&#x27;t belong to them.  They then have to analyze the data, then repeat the process for the second layer, etc.  What would be done in a few minutes if they already had the data now might take a few weeks.  If you believe that an attack is likely, you may not have a week to identify the initial contact, two weeks to identify the cell he&#x27;s working in, etc.<p>All of this rests on the assumption that analyzing phone metadata is good way to get leads for an investigation on international terrorism.  Are there better ways to get leads?  Can the information still be useful if gathered through a traditional warrant process?  If not, is it worth the privacy tradeoff to foil X number of cases over the course of a decade, and are there good ways to handle the information in order to mitigate privacy concerns?",1384946077

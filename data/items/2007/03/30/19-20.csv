This is centralized planning.<p>2) The content that teachers generate (assignments, quizzes) is put into a centralized pool, which other teachers can browse through to come up with new ideas for their teaching.  This is centralized content.<p>I'm sorry I wasn't clear, but I didn't mean centralized planning, I meant centralized content.  If there is some way to know what a teacher taught and how well it worked which other teachers could use as a reference, then it becomes a memory.  Teachers can improve upon other teachers' previous works.  <p>Right now, each public school teacher is almost universally independent.  My idea is that as each assignment is completed online, the assignment goes into the memory pool.  Teachers can browse all content.  Students and teachers can rate and comment on the assignments.  This seems like it would encourage good collaboration and interaction.",1175284530

I haven't really looked back into that time in my life, 'til now.  I'm not upset, I turned out fine, I just personally feel that in a bigger school I could have become social more quickly by interacting with a wider variety of other kids. <p>",1175284006

7655,comment,7608,7622,0,0,notabel,,,"I have to disagree with you, and vehemently.  Centralization is exactly the problem.<p>I was lucky enough to be educated in an International Baccalaureate program that stressed interaction between students and teachers, convivial debate rather than lecture, and analytic essays instead of rote recall.  The strength of the program came from its decentralization, relying on good teachers rather than central planning. The teachers and students worked together, as collaborators.<p>Technology is a wonderful thing, but in education, it generally gets in the way of the greatest teacher: intellectual discourse.  A teacher and 10-20 students talking with each other[1] is an optimal model for learning.  Educational technology generally takes the personal interaction out of things, and certainly makes the process less engaging.[2]<p>[1] Very different from a teacher talking to, or at, students.<p>[2] I'm talking about secondary education.  For primary ed, technology can be very useful.  But that is a very different environment.",1175283574

7650,comment,7608,7636,0,0,palish,,,"I'm only one data point, so you should probably take this with a grain of salt.  I went to a Montessori school from kindergarten through third grade, and I can't stress enough how badly that specific Montessori school failed.  Teachers were distant, more like babysitters than having any kind of structure.  Any project we wanted to work on was fine, but most of us didn't do anything (the equivalent of pretending to work at work).  We'd have to keep track of what we did in journals and get them signed by a teacher, so most of us made up stuff and forged the teacher's signature.  I don't remember learning any mathematics at all back then.  In fact, I'm positive that it wasn't until fourth grade that I got into basic math.  I don't know if that's normal, but my father had been teaching me math outside of school from a very early age, so I was still strong in it.  It's a very strange school system.<p>My final observation is that my Montessori school was so <i>small</i>!  I was a shy kid, and going to a small school from K-3rd grade, then another small school from 4th-8th grade, did not help me to become a social person one bit.  If you do something against the group, everyone will hate you, resulting in more shyness.  Even at third grade.<p>You probably should evaluate your child.  Is s/he shy?  If so, it may be a benefit to send them to a larger school.  I'm not saying that it will cure them of shyness, but it may help.<p>I'll totally respect any decision you make though :)",1175282814

I think such arguments make for great philosophical papers. But really they have little practical meaning.<p>Two things:<p>1. the argument that stuff like Twitter and YouTube are time wasters and thus amoral can be debated to death and debates are the last thing entrepreneurs like to get into; we would rather build more YouTubes and more Twitters<p>2. if you think that Twitter and YouTube are nothing but time wasters, you are simply being short sighted.<p>Ya'll need to realize that many new tools in their initial stages are used for fun, and that is the stage most of the new generation of web2.0 ideas are in. It has been what less than three or four years since facebook took off, and YouTube sucked us in? And already we are hearing of YouTube 's use in catching stupid crooks, facebook as a tool to find lost wallets and Twitter's potential to help during a SF earthquake. Such waste of time, eh.<p>---",1175281638

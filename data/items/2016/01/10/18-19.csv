(It&#x27;s also a helluva lot easier to do, or un-do.)<p>In particular, CQRS helps you make a sane architecture for &quot;read models&quot;, where certain features (say, a homepage showing a hard-to-calculate leaderboard) are simple queries against a data-source designed specifically for that feature. The backing data-source is kept up to date by application code as a side-effect of your &quot;real work&quot;.<p>This means you can substantially reduce the runtime load on the database as well as reducing how much application-logic &quot;leaks across&quot; in triggers/procedures/views.

There is always a better service that you don&#x27;t know about. It can be better to decide &quot;I will spend one hour researching metrics/dashboard services, and pick the best one I find, and spend another testing out the service.&quot; rather than trying to end up with the most perfect solution and testing every solution there is.<p>That said, sometimes it&#x27;s more time efficient to avoid having one extra service to maintain. One has to avoid using a service in a way that the business is too dependent on it, or that the service is not easily replaced.

This isn&#x27;t the same as regular security software where they theoretically are secure, but practically have holes, and so there&#x27;s gains by opening it up and letting people report holes. There would be no theoretical security model here, it would only be probabilistic. There may not be a &quot;patch&quot; for the kind of holes (I&#x27;ll give an example soon). So security by obscurity might make more sense here than in general.<p>Example: suppose our data shows that people that drive car X have a greater security risk. If this is kept secret, we are able to more effectively target people (probably, many different factors will combine until someone is an extreme risk, but this is simplified.) The fact that X is weak evidence of risk is information that becomes useless relatively soon after it is publicized (because potential terrorists just put &quot;don&#x27;t buy X&quot; on their checklists.) So publicizing the algorithm would concretely lead to worse results.<p>Realistically, car model probably isn&#x27;t too predictive, but possibly the union of all behaviors that are easy to change when known predicts risk reasonably well.",1452451571

People keep thinking that programmers are like  factory employees. And that&#x27;s so wrong. Each engineering endeavour is different. In software, our factory workers, are the tools that do the job. What in other places is designing in software is just programming. In my view (and I&#x27;m not alone in that) people keep applying the manufacturing metaphor to software for the wrong reasons.<p>In construction, the distance between design and implementation is so huge, that the construction workers  save or doom construction projects all the time. Spend some time in a big construction site, in their meetings and you will discover why those projects take so long to finish. Hence, they are important because what the designer design is just an specification for the project, it&#x27;s a map not the territory. An ideal brick in a CAD program is not a brick. Your perfect design for the AirCon machine in that room got destroyed by an in place decision by a worker of changing the wiring in a wall, ignoring the plan. Through tremendous effort during centuries construction has accumulated more or less accurate models for bricks, but the workers do so many things that the architects doesn&#x27;t know how to do that the distance persist, and my times just ignore them.<p>In manufacturing, you have the Ford model of car manufacturing. It has being employed in nearly every single factory in the world. Yes, the Japanese empowered their  employees more than in other countries but hey, they took note and introduced some of the practices. As of today American companies are as competitive as the Japanese ones without all the mumbo jumbo and black zen magic.<p>My point here is that each engineering is different. Different factors forced us to discover what work for them and what doesn&#x27;t. That knowledge was accumulated in the industry and depending on the engineering, the feedback loop from the industry into the University could vary <i>a lot</i>. In software, the distance between the two is huge, due to the lack of transparency and secretism that most software companies exhibit.",1452451432

It&#x27;s giving someone a car loan when you know they&#x27;re likely to default and then pay pennies on the dollar in collections. They will then have paid half the market price for their car and you will have paid the other half. That is clearly not profitable for you so doing it on purpose is charity.<p>> For something to be charity, you need to determine that the receiver does not rightfully deserve it, and the giver does.<p>Gibberish. Charity means giving to the less fortunate. The robber barons were terrible but you can&#x27;t arbitrarily redefine words in order to claim they didn&#x27;t give to charity.<p>And you&#x27;re missing the point. I don&#x27;t care what you call it, if your goal is to have the government take from the rich and give to the poor then just <i>do that</i>. Collect simple taxes and then give the money away. Don&#x27;t come up with weird complicated economically distorting contortions with large and hard to predict negative externalities.<p>> As what we do or don&#x27;t do determine the outcome, any decision is a political choice. Saying that we&#x27;re specifically trying to change something is no different from saying that we&#x27;re specifically trying to keep something the same.<p>Of course it&#x27;s a political choice, but that doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about what should be done or not done. And saying you&#x27;re specifically trying to change something tells people <i>what</i> you&#x27;re specifically trying to change.<p>> Therefore, if we look at the racial or sexual makeup of a certain source of social power and we find a gross disparity, we want to balance it.<p>But your categories are arbitrary. Race is a thing idiots made up. It isn&#x27;t a real thing, it&#x27;s a social construct. What justifies groups to be defined as they are? Why don&#x27;t we also care about the economic disparities (which actually exist) between Irish Americans and English Americans? Or short and tall? Ugly and pretty? Consider whether the reason is because those lines don&#x27;t map with existing political coalitions.<p>Everyone who is not born rich is so because of some historical misfortune not shared by their rich-born contemporaries. That&#x27;s the line that sums up all the other lines. If you want to help the poor, help the poor. If you find a specific instance of racial discrimination (as in causation not correlation) then stamp it out. But Mercedes is not doing something wrong or obligated to do something different just because there is a racial disparity in who can afford their cars.",1452450311

Here is what Scott Gray of Nervana Systems, who developed a native assembler for Maxwell, write about it[1]: &quot;Starting with the Kepler architecture Nvidia has been moving some control logic off of the chip and into kernel instructions which are determined by the assembler. This makes sense since it cuts down on die space and power usage, plus the assembler has access to the whole program and can make more globally optimal decisions about things like scheduling and other control aspects. The op codes are already pretty densely packed so Nvidia added a new type of op which is a pure control code. On Kepler there is 1 control instruction for every 7 operational instructions. Maxwell added additional control capabilities and so has 1 control for every 3 instructions.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/NervanaSystems/maxas/wiki/Control-Codes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/NervanaSystems/maxas/wiki/Control-Codes</a>",1452449820

Frama-C was tantalizingly capable - it was easy to tell Frama-C what I wanted to prove, and it managed to propagate possible values and control flow through the program pretty accurately, even with minimal assistance. Although I disliked the absence of a usable text-mode integration (vim?), the GUI presented the results clearly. The Frama-C manuals were extensive, mostly up-to-date, and managed to explain even complicated concepts in a pretty clear way. (Fair warning: although I have zero background in formal methods, I have quite a lot of mathematical training and like language lawyering.)<p>Unfortunately, Frama-C did not grok malloc() at the time. My program consisted of I/O into malloc()&#x27;ed buffers plus some processing. Teaching Frama-C about malloc() was clearly beyond my skill. Worse, I really wanted to prove that my program output was some suitably processed form of its input data, and I didn&#x27;t look forward to trying to model read()/write() - so I stopped the experiment, and planned to revisit Frama-C in a couple years.<p>Actual experts can apparently get much better results: Frama-C was used to prove that chunks of PolarSSL were free of certain undefined behavior (<a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1261"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1261</a>, or the actual report at <a href=""http://trust-in-soft.com/polarSSL_demo.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trust-in-soft.com/polarSSL_demo.pdf</a>). This is a limited result: huge chunks of code are out-of-bounds. Also, &quot;PolarSSL is memory-safe&quot; is <i>very</i> far from &quot;PolarSSL is a secure SSL library&quot;. Still, I&#x27;m impressed.<p>I did not see a good way to integrate Frama-C in our development process. From reading and talking to some people, I am left with the distinct impression that keeping proofs up-to-date in living software is not a solved problem. Frama-C does allow you to annotate code with assertions (which, I expect, can act as hints to the provers). However, the workflow still seems to be oriented around Frama-C&#x27;s interactive mode, which is very powerful but doesn&#x27;t yield artifacts that can easily be reused. Also, mastering Frama-C is <i>hard</i> - it&#x27;s not something that you can just expect a software developer to pick up.<p>(In contrast, the Coverity static analysis tool uses unsound analysis and can&#x27;t guarantee anything. However, colleagues report that it does a decent job at finding <i>some</i> bugs with a low false-positive rate, especially after you add a few annotations. Coverity offers ongoing scans to open-source projects; unfortunately, Coverity&#x27;s scan servers appear to be backlogged at the moment. &quot;Not a need-to-have, but something we could consider buying.&quot;)",1452449303

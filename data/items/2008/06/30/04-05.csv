The 1950s was a very conformist era, maybe they would have been arrested for being communists.<p>And they didn't even have Home Depot, Kinko's, GPS or Arduinos. There are people who practically make a career out of such pranks, sometimes much less benign -- Billboard Liberation Front, for example.<p><a href=""http://www.billboardliberation.com/2008/02/28/video-of-the-attnsa-improvement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.billboardliberation.com/2008/02/28/video-of-the-a...</a>",1214801822

These people don't care an iota about uncountable number of times I have made complaints about their broadband service which keeps getting mysteriously disconnected time to time. I have checked all the cabling and am sure that problem is on their side.\nTo add more to my frustration, today I couldn't book urgent tickets and within 20 minutes all the travel tickets are gone. This ISP has left us emotionally baffled... these tickets were too important to us.\nHow should I take revenge from these ignorant morons? The morons who provide internet to IT hub of India and claim to connect India, in my case they have disconnected me from my relatives and furthered my daily frustrations.\nWhat to do? (apart from complaining which never works with these people)\nIn the time when globalization has touched even inner parts of India, this ISP employs people in customer care who don't even know India's national language, forget them to understand well, when you speak in English.\nIdeas on how to take revenge from them are welcome.\nI can be imagined to be looking like 'Angry Monkey' of the Family Guy series right now.",1214801099

I'm curious as to whether or not someone has actually done any studies with regards to the claim that happy employees equates to successful companies.<p>If a correlation can be made, then it validates the foosball tables and Wii that seem to be ubiquitous in startups these days.<p>Otherwise, it seems like the article is saying ""these two guys have successful companies because their employees are happy""; versus the conventional wisdom that successful companies tend to have happier employees than unsuccessful ones. In other words, correlation does not equal causality.",1214800188

231703,comment,231153,231605,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Religion as practiced by the common man has always been more about tribal identity and rituals than books or theology.  The preexisting cultural traditions are adapted as needed to satisfy the dictates of the ruling elite.  Most of Christianity is a thin coat on pagan traditions.  Your typical white Christian can't articulate much more than some parables, but knows the pagan celestial feasts of Christmas and Easter are central to his culture.<p>Constantine, King David, Shinto Imperialists, or whatever, come along and write books as part of a social control program, and people shrug and do what they were doing.  See how Catholicism in South America is rife with rituals of native origin, different from the European pagan ones.<p>But Islam is a bit different.  Islam was fairly clearly articulated by well documented real people (I personally don't think Jesus even existed) who spread their beliefs through military conquest.  Islam is unambiguously defined by the koran, both theologically and in practice, in a way not true of most other faiths.  The historical experience of the Caliphate and the enforcement of Islamic law is quite different.  The historical actions of Islamic states have corresponded well to the precepts of the koran.",1214799631

231689,comment,231515,231515,0,0,rglovejoy,,,"I'm not buying the article's comparison with Latin.  A big reason that Latin forked off into Spanish, Italian, French, etc. is because of the influence of Germanic and Moorish invaders.  Also, the vast majority of people living during the Dark Ages were illiterate and had no idea that their Vulgar Latin was evolving into something else.  Add to this the fact that most populations were isolated from each other.<p>Today, we have widespread literacy, sound recordings and linguists who are able to identify these trends.  Humans are becoming less and less isolated, so there are actually fewer opportunities for English to diverge, not more.",1214798442

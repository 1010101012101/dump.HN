9809158,comment,9808232,9808232,0,0,krapht,,,"I watched the talk, not having a lot of exposure to functional programming, but having exposure to C++ through my job. I am still not sure I understand his presentation.<p>The beginning was straightforward and had some good takeaways. The message was, as he showed through some examples such as a date class, that if you can avoid mutating state, then do so. Prefer to construct immutable objects that support fast copying via move semantics.  This way, you can preserve class invariants easily. This is something I agree with, and have started to try to do in my new code. I guess the other benefit is that you can avoid passing const ref& around, and just pass by value everywhere, and the compiler will optimize it for you via return value optimization and move semantics.<p>Kevlin spends the middle part of the presentation talking about how to implement an immutable list in C++ using the STL style. The main change seems to be he has added const modifiers to everything, pop_front/pop_back now return a new list minus one popped element, and he&#x27;s added an internal shared_ptr to track references to the list, (I didn&#x27;t quite follow why it was used - I&#x27;d probably have to rewatch the presentation). Then, at the end, he talks about asynchronous computation, and how functional programming is a better fit for concurrency because now you need no locks, since data is immutable, and lo, we have an immutable list. But I&#x27;m not sure how they go together to solve any of the typical problems I have with concurrency. Typically I want concurrency because I have a huge, compute intensive problem. With this list, suddenly, I have a huge explosion in memory requirements as each time the list is mutated, I have to store a new copy of the list. I guess I&#x27;d also then have to synchronize access to my new mutated list reference? I&#x27;d need a different algorithm. I feel like functional languages prefer recursive divide and conquer approaches.<p>So, in the end, I don&#x27;t think I was the right audience for this talk, or I didn&#x27;t have enough time to devote to understanding it. I watched the video and ended up more confused about functional C++. I did enjoy his last slide about the actor model. Being familiar with it, I agree that it is a good solution for certain types of concurrency. I see it as sort of a generalized solution to execution flows that can be pipelined.",1435708786

9809156,comment,9808644,9808644,0,0,001sky,,,"<i>&quot;In Europe, meat was considered the manliest, strongest component of a meal,&quot; Laudan notes, and chefs wanted it to shine. So they began cooking meat in meat-based gravies, to intensify its flavor.</i><p>Main thesis.<p>Interestingly enough, the European pallate has also had a dterimental effect on some oriental and african cuisines athat were historically more spicy.<p>That bein said, history doesn&#x27;t really bear out the main thses as laid out in the headline. Spices were a very late addition to the european pallatte, and the timeline give for their retrenchment would put them at a very small proportion of the timeline of historical europe. In other words, &quot;the spice&quot; era was merely a short lived fad. For most of its history spices were rare and not very widespread in usage, then they were available, and then they were superseeded with other technical innovations. The technical innovation of stock based sauce is a derivative of increasing economic wealth. But the snob factor is really a poor way to phrase it. It is more true that the european pallate took the spice out of middle-eastern and north african cuisine based on the snob-factor. This makes more sense because the status of european pallate was seen as being higher than local cuisinge during the colonial and post-colonial transition peirods. That is, it was social aspiration driving the trend, not technical innovation. Its much less clear that a similar explanatory sequence works for the evolution of the euroean pallate itself.",1435708758

Generally with most companies there will be a salary range for most positions. You&#x27;re right that if that salary range is out of wack with the prevailing market rates the company is unlikely to retain good people (or attract them in the first place).<p>But assuming the range has been set more or less correctly you&#x27;re likely to have a salary at least in the ballpark of what&#x27;s appropriate.<p>My point was really about pushing your manager to go towards the high end of that range (either for a new job offer or a raise at an existing job. doesn&#x27;t matter). As long as you&#x27;ve got some ammo in your corner this will generally be possible. But then afterwards I go back to what I said.

9809153,comment,9805978,9808117,0,0,krick,,,"As I said I don&#x27;t have strong opinion on that matter. It just struck me as something I remembered as not recommended by some guidelines, considered to be <i>good</i> example of error message standard and violated here, in another post about &quot;good error messages&quot;. But let me play devil&#x27;s advocate, anyway.<p>Compiler is relatively simple piece of machinery, it isn&#x27;t really <i>smart</i>. So maybe it shouldn&#x27;t pretend it is? It doesn&#x27;t have personality, it doesn&#x27;t think anything, it doesn&#x27;t actually even <i>do</i> anything: it is just a set of transformations from one set of bytes to another. In the worst case it has some heuristically-statistical optimizations, but it still is some process that can be accurately described in a relatively short amount of time. I don&#x27;t want it to have an opinion and actually I know it doesn&#x27;t have one. I know all has happened is that <i>I</i> made a mistake and I just want to know exactly what went wrong. I don&#x27;t want to read compiler&#x27;s essay about how it spent its holidays, because I know it cannot write essays and didn&#x27;t have holidays anyway.<p>At the moment I don&#x27;t use Elm, but if I did, I would be getting such messages tens, hundreds times a day. Every time I have to search for something one could call &quot;the <i>real</i> problem&quot; in the bigger text — I do work. I spend energy. Sometimes I can do so while being mentally exhausted or in a hurry. Or both. The more short, exact and concise message will be, the easier to understand the problem it will be and the greater my gratitude towards the author of this message will be. And it&#x27;s not only about <i>length</i> of the message, human-like natural language constructs are inherently more complicated and diverse than short messages and labels — that&#x27;s the reason why we <i>invent</i> labels and such after all.<p>All the good answers must be the direct answers to the question one might ask. When I&#x27;m about to read the error message of the compiler, I&#x27;m not thinking &quot;Dear friend Compiler, what have you been doing in the meanwhile and what do you think about life?&quot;. No, I&#x27;m asking &quot;What the hell did happen?&quot;. What <i>did happen</i>, and not what &quot;did compiler do&quot; or &quot;how things work&quot; or whatever.<p>One more problem is that Elm compiler might work just nice, but it won&#x27;t <i>always</i> be right. I don&#x27;t believe it and you probably shouldn&#x27;t rely on it. The less creative it will be in its search for &quot;what might have happened&quot;, the more likely it is I won&#x27;t be distracted by its opinion. Even as skeptical and suspicious as I am, I am prone to get used to how some tool behaves. If it usually is right and tries to deceive me by behaving smarter and more human like than it is — one day I will believe it and spend way more time to figure out the problem than I would have if I treated is as <i>a compiler</i> and not my mate.<p>So, finally, what is the <i>real</i> purpose of the error message? I love artistic people, but unfortunately it isn&#x27;t to show how thoughtful and creative the author of this piece of technology is. The <i>real</i> purpose is to help me find my mistake. There are 2 general types of mistake I can make: a simple one, like a typo, syntax error, forgotten type, variable definition, you know what I mean — and a complicated one, like unexpectedly finding a bug in the compiler itself, some weird Rust-lifetime problem, — It&#x27;s hard, to make up an example, but the point is it requires some thinking and research. Help I need in the case of simple mistake is generally just as precise place of the mistake in the code as possible. Maybe some function signature with good description of parameters. Something I can easily grep (ack) or google (DuckDuckGo) in the case of more &quot;internally-oriented&quot; errors. I don&#x27;t usually find &quot;typo suggestions&quot; useful, but ok, why not. The thing is 3 times out of 5 I will fix my mistake quicker than I do the reading (even in the languages with less verbose error messages), literally. I would thank my compiler for being as concise and straight-forward as possible to shorten the gap even more. I don&#x27;t want to read what I don&#x27;t need to.<p>In the case of &quot;the complicated mistake&quot; it is not likely compiler will actually guess what&#x27;s the matter. I&#x27;ll need stacktraces (if any), precise and unique exception names (error codes), maybe some additional info, but nothing that compiler can actually handle to discover itself.<p>So the best compromise I can imagine, which, I think, would help in both cases, would be short, concise, &quot;machine-like&quot; messages, concrete things like function signatures, &quot;expected/found&quot; diffs and links to the related section of documentation (web-based or local one — the latter would be even better) where everything would be described in the detail. And no playing a human.",1435708648

9809144,comment,9807877,9808673,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>After you negotiate the raise, make sure you live up to it.</i><p>I disagree, not with the advice (obviously, living up to the new expectations is better than falling short of them) but with the attitude (often espoused by management) that a bump in your compensation comes with a harder job.<p>Often it comes with an <i>easier</i> job. The intellectual demands may get higher, but the emotional demands of subordination tend to go away when you go from a $90k junior peon to a $135k trusted senior to a $180k VP-level fellow who gets to call technical shots. When I was a junior, I had to maintain shit code written in languages I hated, and if I struggled with something and pointed to the bad code, that&#x27;d be met with suspicion because I was lower on the totem pole. Now I get to pick tools most of the time and if I say that something is hard and needs to be done a different way, people believe me.<p>The technical challenges have become harder as I&#x27;ve risen, but the jobs get easier and way better on the whole. Eight years ago I wouldn&#x27;t just grab a side office and write some code (I probably could have, but I was insecure and young and felt a need to be in the open-plan environment for 8 straight hours, panic attacks be damned). Now, I know that I have sufficient status that I can do that, and that matters a huge amount. Technical challenges (the part of work that I enjoy) going up and the emotional load of being low-ranking (that slowly kills a person) going down is a win on both fronts.<p>Of course, if my company gets taken over and everyone has to typecast to a junior ScrumDrone-- &quot;Agile&quot; is &quot;how to be a 2x Junior Developer&quot;-- then I&#x27;ll be laid off shortly after because I&#x27;m massively overpaid for a ScrumDrone. No one who takes &quot;user stories&quot; seriously is worth what I make, so the minute I hear people talking about Scrum (bringing down the 10xers to turn the 0.2x into 0.6x) I get nervous.<p>If you&#x27;re planning to ask for a raise, you need to kick ass before you go in and ask for it. And you should really ask for a promotion (not, &quot;boss, I want your job&quot;, but more responsibility and perhaps a title improvement so long as it doesn&#x27;t put you in the awkward position of outranking your manager) rather than just asking for more money for the same job (an unattractive proposition to the boss, no matter what). In general, this happens incrementally. You ask for a 15% raise and only get 5%, so you ask for a title bump, even if it doesn&#x27;t mean you take on reports. Because of the title bump, you get better projects, you&#x27;re taken more seriously, you suffer less emotional load and perform better, and you&#x27;re also in a higher bonus pool. Two years later when the company is flush with cash, you get a 25% raise without asking because you&#x27;re actually the lowest paid VP and they&#x27;ve decided to correct that.<p>Working hard matters the most in the 3-6 months before you ask for the new responsibilities, promotion, and of course the pay increase that come with it (or, at least, <i>can</i> come with it). Then you settle into the new role and it doesn&#x27;t matter that much how hard you work (average to average-plus effort is fine) so long as people like you and you follow the &quot;become part of the team before trying to become its leader&quot; principle. The before- and after-negotiation phases have different rules, but the former is harder on the whole.<p>Of course, people who are smart about this will negotiate continuously, involving themselves with (or starting) big projects without asking for permission, delegating the less interesting tasks to (preferably eager) juniors even if they don&#x27;t formally manage them, making changes to your arrangements (WFH, taking a seat with a wall at your back) to improve your productivity, and generally feeling out what their position actually is. If you don&#x27;t continuously negotiate, you&#x27;re probably not going to feel comfortable marching into someone&#x27;s office and asking for $20k more, and you probably haven&#x27;t done the micro-negotiation ground work (getting your title in line, getting your best projects noticed and your weak spots ignored, delegating the work that won&#x27;t help your case or make your important projects succeed) necessary to make the raise seem like an obvious &quot;yes&quot;.",1435708501

9809138,comment,9805520,9807081,0,0,kazinator,,,"Transducers are functions. The thing is that they are functions that are designed to serve as the functional argument to reduce. And they pair with ordinary functions which are not transducers.<p>For instance if we have (map inc [1 2]), there exists a transducer function T such that:<p><pre><code>  (reduce T [1 2])  ==   (map inc [1 2])\n</code></pre>\nI.e. we can somehow do &quot;map inc&quot; using reduce.<p>Okay?<p>Now, the clever thing is this: why don&#x27;t we allow map to be called without the list argument? Just let it be called like this:<p><pre><code>  (map inc)\n</code></pre>\nThis looks like partial application, right? Now what would partial application do? It would curry the &quot;inc&quot;, returning a function of one argument that takes a list, i.e.:<p><pre><code>  ;; if it were partial application, then:\n  ((map inc) [1 2])  ;; same as (map inc [1 2])\n</code></pre>\nBut Hickey did something clever; he overloaded functions like map so that (map inc) returns T!<p><pre><code>  (reduce (map inc) [1 2]) ;; same as (map inc [1 2])\n</code></pre>\nThe cool thing is that this (map inc) composes with other functions of its kind. So you can compose together the transducers of list processing operations, which are then put into effect inside a single reduce, and the behavior is like the composition of the original list processors.<p>It&#x27;s like a linear operator; like LaPlace.

Culturally, it worked (the culture of mediocrity is well-established in the software industry); economically, it failed (because large teams of mediocrities are actually fucking expensive, because a &quot;10x&quot; engineer only costs about 1.5-2.5x an average one).<p>The sales pitch for OOP to the Forces of Evil was that OOP would make it possible to hire a couple of low-paid body-shop programmers too stupid to recognize the OP as either (a) satire or, missing the joke but still correct, just wrong. Smart wizards in the open-source world and at companies like Google would do the actual engineering that made efficient hash-maps possible, and CommodityScrumDrones would staple shit together using topologies thereof, without really understanding any of the technologies they were gluing together, and probably ignorant of why these things are sometimes called &quot;hashes&quot; in the first place.<p>The problem is that when CommodityScrumDrones grow up and become middle managers and get to start making technical choices, they often make bad ones.

9809025,comment,9806954,9808075,0,0,kbenson,,,">  For a business that really only needs to accomplish two things to make their customers happy: 1) print tickets and 2) stop scalpers, they do absolutely terrible at those 2 things.<p>Their job isn&#x27;t really to do either of those things, and I&#x27;m not being glib.  Let me explain:<p>First, TicketMaster (TM) doesn&#x27;t really want to print your tickets.  They would much rather just digitally manage them, and let you use your phone to go the the venue.  Non-digital media costs real money, and TM would prefer to charge you for the convenience of managing your tickets, or sending you a PDF.  As a bonus to them, this lets you easily resell your tickets as a fan on their TM+ exchange.<p>Secondly, TM doesn&#x27;t really want to stop scalpers, at least not completely.  This one is a bit complex, because <i>portions</i> of TM are definitely not scalper (i.e. broker) friendly, while other portions are.  TM runs their own secondary market, called TM+, which is a &quot;fan resale&quot; market, in which they list ticket that were sold on the primary market (i.e. TM) for resale, with the benefit that since they were the original seller, they actually reissue the tickets with new barcodes and they are guaranteed to be accurate and work for entry.  They are quite happy to work with the broker industry on this side, and will integrate with larger brokers to allow listings to be easily updated.<p>Personally, I think the bad names brokers get as a whole are often unwarranted, as there is a lot of benefit to a secondary market that people often ignore when they see extremely expensive tickets, such as extremely underpriced tickets for events that bomb (or another date is added), and the ability to find tickets for an event long after it&#x27;s sold out (without a resale market, you would have little recourse to see an event that sold out minutes after it went on sale unless you got your tickets right then).  That said, there are some bad actors in this arena, which brings us to the following...<p>> I don&#x27;t mean terrible as in they do the job poorly, it&#x27;s just that they care 0% about the user experience during the entire ticketing process from end-to-end.<p>TM has a really hard job.  I&#x27;m not sure you understand the scale of traffic they get on a popular event&#x27;s main sale.  They can literally sell out a 30,000 seat venue in seconds.  Keep in mind, on a sale that&#x27;s busy like that, there are often brokers (the bad actors referenced before) that are running industry software that leverages AWS/GCE/Linode/Rackspace, etc to access the main sale page tens to hundreds of times a second <i>per instance</i> during that sale to get CAPTCHA words and answer them.  Since the CAPTCHA success rate is relatively low, they brute force it with many, many parallel requests.  Consider that during peak sale season, there may be multiple of these large sales per hour, all set to open on the hour.  TM is constantly battling these brokers by changing subtly how their ticketing system functions.  It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t care about customer experience (although they do have enough of the market to not have to worry too much), but that it&#x27;s only part of an equation that must also be balanced with insane levels of load balancing and queuing to handle the crazy load they see.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t want to give the impression that TM is without fault.  They&#x27;ve definitely got their fingers in multiple industries here which historically have had quite a bit of animosity, and they are fairly good at playing the media and the industries against one each other while secretly assuaging them in the background.  The fact of the matter is that you as a customer aren&#x27;t their only concern and aren&#x27;t their only business.  They are actively balancing the needs of the promoters, artists, venue and brokers, because their business caters to all of them.<p>Edit: Clarified scope of virtual server usage slightly.",1435706523

The go-to example for a lot of the doctrine is the Falklands war which was over 30 years ago. That said:<p>To a certain extent a modern fighter plane <i>is</i> just a missile platform. You want your missile platform to be fast and stealthed, and you want it to be able to fly close to the ground to make it harder to detect, which means making it maneuverable and at current technology levels probably forces it to be piloted. You want the survivability stuff - ECM, flares and all that.<p>At that point you&#x27;re most of the way to having a modern dedicated fighter (like say the F-22). Could you leave off having detection equipment on the fighter itself? Maybe, but that would severely limit where you could operate - AWACS planes can&#x27;t really operate in disputed territory (they tend to be modified civilian airframes, they don&#x27;t have any of the things in the previous paragraph, because they want to carry large bulky radars). Radar and the like is a relatively small addition and opens up a lot of other mission possibilities - either escorting bombers in hostile territory or, these days, taking on a bombing role itself (modern fighters are large enough, and modern missiles heavy enough, and modern precision bombs light enough, that it seems like every modern fighter has at least some ground-attack capability). Interestingly enough the F-22 goes in the opposite direction - it&#x27;s been described as a &quot;mini-AWACS&quot; and can provide targeting information to friendly aircraft.<p>Is it then worth using the same plane for close air support? It&#x27;s arguable but IMO that part also makes sense. It&#x27;s the STOVL requirement that really kills the F-35 - cut the lift fan, narrow the fuselage and you&#x27;d have a good aeroplane (which would still have software problems, but I&#x27;m not sure building multiple aircraft would have gone any better on that front).",1435705707

9808952,comment,9805520,9808309,0,0,bad_user,,,"I disagree, Java was designed to be marketable to the layman and for a very good reason ...<p>Software companies can scale either horizontally (e.g. hiring more people) or vertically (hiring the best). Because of the classical bell curve distribution, really good people are hard to find, therefore horizontal scalability is very much preferred (and obviously not everybody can have &quot;the best&quot;). Unfortunately you can&#x27;t really grow a company both horizontally and vertically. The reason for it is because getting good results from mediocre people requires lots of <i>processes</i>, coordination/synchronization and politics of the sort that doesn&#x27;t appeal to really good people and that&#x27;s because really good people have a choice, because of the supply-demand equation which favors them.<p>In the wild you&#x27;ll also notice another reason for why horizontal scalability is preferred. Corporate departments and consultancy companies are usually scaled horizontally because they get paid per developer/hour and unfortunately there are only 24 hours in a day. Hence the bigger the team, the bigger the budget. On the other hand small teams happen in startups where you often see 2-3 people doing everything. Small teams also happen in big software companies, when speaking of either privileged seniors or folks that handle real research.<p>Big teams are getting things done, as Alan Kay was saying, on the same model as the Egyptian pyramids, with thousands of people pushing large bricks around. Small teams on the other hand tend to handle complexity by means of better abstractions. Unfortunately better abstractions are harder to understand, as they are first of all, <i>unfamiliar</i>.<p>So back to Java ... it&#x27;s actually a pattern that you tend to notice. Such languages are afraid of doing anything that wasn&#x27;t proven already in the market. The marketing for such languages also relies on fear and doubt of the alternatives, which Sun took advantage of, appealing to the insecurity of the many. This is one language that refused to implement generics because they were too hard and then when they happened, the implementation chose use-site variance by means of wildcards, with optional usage, possibly the poorest choice they could have made. Generic classes are invariant of course, except for arrays. This is the language that doesn&#x27;t do operator overloading, as if &quot;BigInteger.add&quot; is more intuitive than a &quot;+&quot;, but on the other hand it does have a + for Strings. This is the language in which == always does referential equality, so you&#x27;ve got tools converting every == to .equals because that&#x27;s what you need most of the time. The language which until recently didn&#x27;t have anonymous functions because anonymous classes should be enough. This is the language in which everything needs to be in a class, even though the concept of &quot;static method&quot; makes no sense whatsoever. This is the language in which at least 30% of all libraries are doing bytecode manipulation to get around the language&#x27;s deficiencies. Such languages also avoid metalinguistic abstractions like a plague, such as macros, because OMG, OMG, people aren&#x27;t smart enough for that (though truth be told, you&#x27;re expanding your language every time you write a function, but don&#x27;t tell that to the weak). Also, AOP  is a thing that has a name in Java, which is pretty funny, given that in other languages it tends to be effortless function composition.<p>As an environment it turned out to be great, eventually. If you want another shinning example, take a look at Go. Same story.<p>In other words Clojure or Scala will never reach the popularity of something like Java. Sorry, people can wish for it, but it will never happen. And that&#x27;s OK.",1435705274

You can see the issue here: <a href=""https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/issues/216"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/issues/216</a><p>At the time I was trying to learn elm (and functional programming) and I didn&#x27;t know it was a bug so it gave me a lot of troubles: I could never fully trust the compiler.<p>Then I left elm and focused on haskell but now I think I see how he solved the bug:<p><pre><code>    As I infer the type of values flowing through your program, I see a conflict\n    between these two types:\n\n        String\n\n        number\n</code></pre>\nAnyway these new messages are very helpful, especially when compared to haskell error like:<p><pre><code>    Could not deduce (b ~ c)\n    from the context (Num b, Num c)\n    bound by the type signature for\n          f :: (Num b, Num c) => [a] -> (b, c)\n      at restriction.hs:(4,1)-(5,32)\n      `b&#x27; is a rigid type variable bound by\n          the type signature for f :: (Num b, Num c) => [a] -> (b, c)\n\n</code></pre>\nGreat job.",1435705229

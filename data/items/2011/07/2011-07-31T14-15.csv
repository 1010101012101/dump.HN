route. Currently very close to resigning a cushy salaried job as
an Enterprise Java consultant. Would love your honest opinions on
whether I'm in good shape for striking out on my own.<p>I have two reasons for doing so: A) I want to be able to call my
own shots in how I spend my time. The commute is killing me, for
one thing. B) I also want to bootstrap my own products. Have
launched one web application a few years ago (didn't catch on,
but I learned a lot.) I have a long list of ideas I'm eager to execute on, but unable to do so while working fulltime at a BigCo (I'd like to, and I've tried once earlier, but it didn't work out and probably won't while I work a fulltime salaried job.)<p>I'm 33 yrs old. Ten years experience as a paid developer. Competent
Java/Ruby/JavaScript programmer. Frontend, backend and some
mobile experience. I've done some speaking in the local developer
community, got some open repos in GitHub in multiple languages
and have a couple of public webapps/websites in my portfolio. I'm
certainly no ""rock star"" though!<p>I have a decent network, but mainly composed of developers, not too many
product owners/stakeholders/gatekeepers.<p>I'm a family man, but we've gotten our living expenses down to
the point where we can live well if I pull in at average 3k each
month (take-home pay). Have saved up a nest egg which will carry us for 6 months
if I'm unable to get any contracting work at all. If I'm able to
get work charging around 100-150$/hr I'd only need to work around 16
full weeks a year or on average 2 days a week to get by. This is a very rough calculation and subject to differences in currencies and living expenses from the US, but I think you get the idea: I've done my homework.<p>Oh and I live in a Scandinavian country, near one of the
capitals (where most of the web/software work is going on).<p>So. How does my situation sound to you? I think this should work
but I need some outside validation. What are my chances?<p>Really, one of the biggest things holding me back is a small fear
that the current debt situation in the US turns into worldwide financial armageddon - would I be better off on my own or continuing work at a BigCo in that case?",1312124325

Back then in 2006 the yearly H-1B were ""released"" in late May or early June I believe, and they finished in a month or so, so this might be good to take into consideration when planning. I believe a good time for the employer to file application is in April or May, and then the H-1B is typically ready in September.<p>After the internship some other option came up for me back home in Sweden so I never used my H-1B.<p>Note: This was not for a startup, but for an established company with HR and all that stuff.

The prof had been polling people about sensitive topics like race. His survey asked respondents only yes/no questions and asked them only to listen to each question and privately write down yes or no to each question. Then they were asked to count the yeses. By only asking 1/2 the survey group the sensitive question, you get a measure of the true ratio for the sensitive question. You end up doubling the sample size to get the same number of responses, but you allow people to hide behind their other answers.",1312124088

At the outset I would like to apologize for such a long delay in publication of this statement. I explained that it was dictated only by the good service investigation conducted to determine the causes of failure and the people responsible for it. Unfortunately, to date, despite intensive efforts, could not determine these issues. However, I believe that the longer pause to disclose this communication at this stage would be unreasonable. I am also aware that service users are the appropriate explanation. On 26 July 2011 at about 23:00, I noticed that absorbs all Bitcoin server machine resources, and probably not used for making. So there was need to increase the amount of RAM in the server. As a result of that procedure - suddenly the whole virtual machine has been erased, all data stored on the server has been lost!, Including records concerning bitcoinowego portfolio and its backups (backups). I have taken action have established that the disappearance of the data was the result of the introduction of virtual server settings, which he never would have introduced. Amazon Web Services Company, which is located servers, website says that the machine that has been cleared has been set up in such a way as to be irretrievably destroyed automatically with the data on disks attached to it at the time of her arrest by the shutdown. We are constantly trying to determine who made changes to these settings and whether it will be able to recover lost data. Unfortunately partnership with Amazon Web Services, which was placed servers service is difficult. Once I realized that I deleted the machine have redeemed the biggest package of technical support, I talked to the manager, asked about the security of disk space, I explained, so far unsuccessfully. Still exerts pressure on the Amazon Web Services to accelerate their activities but without concrete results. At the moment I am unable to clearly determine the causes of crashes, I suppose that it is the result of actions of third parties, which are causing the server tried to cancel to hide their illegal activities, or intentionally wanted to website disappeared. If my suppositions are confirmed, the fact will let police and prosecutors. At the same time if possible take action through which it would be possible to recreate lost data. But what I need to interact with the server's owner, and that as I mentioned above is difficult. At this point I wish to inform and assure you that your cash deposited into your bank account service and not converted into BTC and unpaid cash from the sale of BTC remain safe and intact. Any further findings will you keep. At the same time I am counting on your help in solving the problem. I realize that the situation is very difficult, and you fear for the fate of their BTC. We are constantly working on a solution to the crisis, and I'm open to your suggestions. Currently going to: cancel all active orders so far, to restore service to operate to allow the performance of any operation (in particular the payment of PLN). Please your suggestions and ideas. I wish to inform you that I had several conversations with potential investors from home and abroad. Www.bitomat.pl service is on sale for EUR 17,000 BTC.

There is nothing <i>inconsistent</i> in either of EJ's posts. They are sometimes complicated (e.g. who contacted who when) and I can imagine HN readers imagining inconsistencies as they scan the posts, but there are none.<p>2. Either EJ is telling lies, or Brian Chesky's post on TC misrepresents/distorts the truth in several places. Indeed, setting the record straight seems to have at least in part motivated EJ's second post.<p>3. It is just weird for the ""niceness"" of the founders to be relevant to this situation, except as part of a cynical effort to turn this into an ""nasty EJ versus the nice founders"" narrative.<p>4. Attacking Arrington (who, like EJ, <i>appears</i> to be offering more solid information than PG or Airbnb) comes off as another attempt to turn the Airbnb founders into the victims of this story.<p>Unless EJ is a liar, focusing any attention at all on the ""plight"" of the founders (e.g PG's message here) demonstrates a detachment from reality. They are warm and cozy in their homes, while she is homeless and shattered.<p>They got some bad coverage on TC, their exit payday might be compromised and rich people will lose money because of it.

2828402,comment,2827349,2828168,2,0,cfshacker,,,"Thanks! Generally speaking, I think you have to understand the nature of ""mental"" illness that's being discussed. Depression, for example, is taken seriously as a ""mental"" illness but is quite comfortably discussed in medical terms (hence SSRI's, NDMA antagonists, etc); as well as Cognitive Behavior Therapy where it's been reasonably demonstrated that improving your thought patterns can improve your emotional wellbeing. I'd describe this as the modern form of ""mental illness"".<p>The kind of ""mental illness"" we're talking about here with CFS & the Wessely/UK psychiatry school of though though is old school _neurosis_. You're not sick, you're neurotic. You want to save face by coming up with symptoms. You need validation from a doctor. You remain sick because of the 'secondary gain' you receive in terms of attention. You need to avoid personal responsibility and blame, and so on.<p>It's horrible stuff. For quotes from the horse's mouth, see: <a href=""http://www.cfsinfo.be/Documentatie/AA%20%20Strijd%20classificatie%20ME/Views%20of%20Simon%20Wesseley.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfsinfo.be/Documentatie/AA%20%20Strijd%20classifi...</a> , and hopefully you can see why his views have been so controversial.<p>It's true that CFS is something of a catch-all for a variety of illnesses, from post-viral syndromes (see Dr Lerner), hypothyroid problems, diet and gut-related illnesses (undiagnosed coeliac patients, for example), neurological syndroms (some people are helped by neurofeedback, and Jay Goldstein wrote some fascinating books on the neuroscience of CFS/ME), hormone disorders (e.g. adrenal, but also others), possible retroviruses (XMRV looks 95% unlikely, but a handful of people did well on antiretrovirals), possible hit-and-run viral brain injury (as Australian research has indicated) and on and on. Hell, I recently came across a guy who recovered almost immediately and totally after 30 years of debilitating fatigue by taking a relatively recent IGE-binding drug (Xolair). Plus, there's the potential of an underlying viral or other cause that in turn causes a differing array of symptoms.<p>The problem is not just that we don't know what CFS/ME is (to the extent that it's a uniform thing), but we're pretty lousy at dealing with all the other surrounding illnesses as well. (Hypothyroid is a great case in point, IGE is relatively new, etc etc,.)<p>What's pretty clear, however, is the vast, vast majority of these patients, whether suffering CFS for known or unknown reasons, are not neurotic, and for The Economist, or anyone, to insist that ""neurosis"" should be taken seriously as a basis for medical diagnosis and treatment in 2011 is simply appalling.<p>edit: ugh, Wessely, not Wessley. my bad.",1312122947

Very simply, you need config flags to operate a site that degrades gracefully when something is going wrong. They cannot be avoided. Is there a query in the forums suddenly hitting the database too hard? Turn off the forums while we fix it so the rest of the site isn't affected. Etc.<p>When a feature is in development, its config flag is off or enabled for admins. We deploy it as we develop it, in pieces that are generally not more than a few dozen lines of code long.

Doing that is a recipe for having a problem and having to review thousands of lines of code to try to figure out what it is.<p>For new features, we generally do not remove the config flag once a feature is live because we want to be able to disable it if anything goes wrong.<p>If we are replacing a feature with another one, we generally want to keep the old one around for a little while (we generally do A/B testing or ramp up new versions whenever we do this).

It's very dangerous: it effectively means that if I look at a picture on the floor I'm not breaking copyright (because I'm not making a copy), but if I view in on a public server I can be held to be in breach of copyright. Just because there are technological steps involved in delivering the picture to my eyes, copyright law suddenly applies, and hard. Copyright is not meant to limit the reading of works, merely their reproduction where such reproduction is marketable/commercially relevant. Browsing a webpage must be viewed as the sort of merely transient ""copying"" that is not a restricted act. There is no permanence in the act and the viewer doesn't take possession of a copy with which he can then compete in the marketplace which the rightsholder is supposed to have a state-granted monopoly over.<p>Wrong in law:
The Ecommerce Directive (2001/29) says that, subject to certain conditions, copies made during transmission by a third party or in your ram, cache, etc, are not reproductions covered by copyright law. The leading case on this is called Infopaq, which summarises:
- the act is temporary;
- it is transient or incidental;
- it is an integral and essential part of a technological process;
- the sole purpose of that process is to enable lawful consumption of the work or a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary of a lawful use of a work or protected subject-matter; and
- the act has no independent economic significance.<p>The recital (explanatory notes) to this exemption is this: ""The exclusive right of reproduction should be subject to an exception
to allow certain acts of temporary reproduction, which are transient or incidental reproductions, forming an integral and essential part of a technological process and carried out for the sole purpose of enabling (...) lawful use of a work or other subject-matter to be made. To the extent that they meet these conditions, this exception should include acts which enable _browsing_ as well as acts of _caching_ to take place, including (...)""<p>The court in Meltwater says that the copies made by the users (which, it says, are unlicensed and thus infringing copies) are not exempt. Its reasoning hinges mostly on the fourth point. It uses circular logic despite accusing the defence of using the same: ""A person making a copy of a
webpage on his computer screen will not have a defence under s. 28A CDPA simply because he has been browsing. He must first show that it was lawful for him to have made the copy. The copy is not part of the technological process; it is generated by his own volition. The whole point of the receipt and copying of Meltwater News is to enable the End User to receive and read it. Making the copy is not an essential and integral part of a technological process but the end which the process is designed to achieve. Storage of the copy and the duration of that storage are matters within the End User's control. It begs the question for decision whether making the copy is to enable a lawful use of the work.<p>This judgement presupposes that a copy is being deliberately made by the user; therefore it 'begs the question' whether the steps leading to that are excepted or not (because this is not lawful consumption). This is of course very flawed: when viewing a .jpg or Meltwater news from a remote server, we are not creating a meaningful copy of it, any more than receiving a broadcast on your TV set. That only happens once you hit Ctrl+S. Because you're just viewing (consuming, not copying) what's placed in plain sight, any RAM/cache/whatnot is in fact incidental to lawful consumption. The court thinks that you cannot consume digital work without meaningfully copying it - because it exists once on the server and they think it can exist simultaneously on many, many different users' terminals. But that is no more 'copying' (in the copyright sense) than happens on TVs in broadcasting (since you ignore all incidental technologically necessary 'copies' that lead up to the display of the work), and is precisely the opposite of what the law (Art 5(1) Ecommerce Directive) says.<p>They consider Infopaq, but all too superficially. From Infopaq: ""23. According to the Hjesteret, it is not disputed in this case that consent from the rightholders is not required to engage in press monitoring activity"" - loading the websites so they can be read (and summarised by hand, or whatever else you want to do that doesn't store a copy of the words). Infopaq objects to the OCR and printing. I don't know if/why this was not flagged up in Meltwater. Infopaq seems poorly considered in that case.<p>Absurd:
- If the mere display of a .JPG were a copy, each re-rendering of the page (scrolling, zooming, AJAX refresh, etc) would be a separate potential infringement, wouldn't it? In fact, each refresh (60 times a second) would be creating an infringing copy.
- everyone (even rightsholders) clearly think there is no infringement possible by mere browsing, otherwise if the traffic lights system goes ahead anyone clicking on a redlighted link is immediately an infringer (because they will be making infringing copies of unlicensed content). It would then be absurd for google to even list the site. In fact Google wouldn't even be able to re-spider it from the instant it is redlighted. Infringement detection agents couldn't safely visit it. Nobody could. That is clearly not what the PRS is suggesting with their traffic light scheme, unless I'm vastly mistaken (or that is in fact their cunning plan).
- if the publisher of a work doesn't want her copy of the work to be available to the public, she can simply stop making it available to the public. If nobody has actually made a copy which they can go on using or serving to the public themselves (which I don't deny would be a restricted act), the work stops being available to the public. If I circumvent the way she sets up her property to reflect her wishes, just to be able to cast eyes upon the work, she at the very least has the Computer Misuse Act to remedy the trespass onto her server. She does <i>not</i> require copyright infringement remedies for that. Horses for courses thus combine to ensure total respect for the publisher without necessitating an expansion of copyright law that were it isn't required - viewing files on a server (nor, for reasons stated in my preceding emails, is it welcome there either).
- the picture on floor vs. picture on webpage dichotomy mentioned in my first paragraph: if it's can lawfully be retrieved and displayed (by looking at the picture on the floor, or requesting it, quite legitimately, from a server) then copyright shouldn't apply, but in Meltwater, it applies to the latter.<p>Any reading of the law that extends the law to where it serves no purpose at all, cannot befit the purpose of the law being read (and it sure ain't necessary in a democratic society, ney'ver).
Even if this were not the plain meaning of the law (which I showed above that it is), <i>if</i> for any reason a judge were to seek a purposive reading of the law (I have, for example, heard of Art 8 - right to private and family life - being applied in more surprising ways that protecting your right to browse the web without courts having the ability to find you in breach of the law for every page you visit - Branduse v Romania was about smelly prisons, ffs, not being able to forward your music, or deeplinks and headlines to your daughter - this allows the judge to use the Human Rights Act as authority for a strained, non-obvious interpretation of the law in order to respect european human rights law), I also think it be possible to read the text appropriately.",1312122157

(Confusing!)<p>You could work for a startup in the USA simply for wages, but that would be certifiably insane. The usual answer is to assign ownership to the investor(s) or American employees and have some arrangement whereby you'll get the benefits later, but that involves a degree of trust in investors that I don't have, personally.<p>See <a href=""http://danashultz.com/blog/2011/05/06/can-i-get-an-h-1b-visa-working-for-my-own-company/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danashultz.com/blog/2011/05/06/can-i-get-an-h-1b-visa...</a> , <a href=""http://danashultz.com/blog/2011/01/18/visa-basics-for-foreign-entrepreneurs-part-2-what-constitutes-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danashultz.com/blog/2011/01/18/visa-basics-for-foreig...</a> .<p>There are ways to get around this, which are pretty similar to money laundering (look it up in a dictionary sometime). Some lawyers are willing to do this, others aren't. Be aware that a lawyer specializing in individual immigration cases is not going to jeopardize their relationship with the US Gov't just for you.<p>Also, even if you conceive of some scheme to get around this, be aware that startups are often very distracted. I tried to join one in the 90s, where a relative of mine was even the CEO, and the relationship was hot/cold for months.

From what I gathered they were extremely barren, but better than the alternative of sleeping on the street in that city. They made it sound like if you try and get by in the city on your own, and you are low-income, it is incredibly vicious (mugging, etc.)<p>What I find interesting is that as these people fight for better conditions and increased wages, Foxconn's reply is ""Whatevs, we are getting robots to replace you"".<p>In the next 3 years they are looking at rolling out 1 million robots to replace workers, I imagine slowly firing 50-70% of their workforce. The only way I see these people not getting fired is the Chinese govt, in an attempt to stem riots[1], requires Foxconn to keep most of them employed.<p>This is an interesting twist of the future... I suppose some part of me assumed that by 2020+ machines would be making most of what I use, but when I look at the scale of jobless people as a result of it, it really makes me scratch my head to figure out where we fit in the future.<p>Our only salvation seems, at least for now, to expand ourselves in creative professions that cannot be performed by machines (yet).<p>When AI finally becomes mature enough to model a human (I don't really expect that to be very far off. Our compute power is getting ridiculous) I imagine that won't be off-limits for robots either and our job as humans will be just to exist and experience... nothing more.<p>tl;dr - assume robots and AI get sufficiently advanced to do most everything physical and most things that are deemed creative... what IS our purpose here then?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPILhiTJv7E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPILhiTJv7E</a>",1312121641

And yes, it doesn't scale and it's very costly to replace, and one of the main reasons it was built in such a manner is because the original architect never thought it would have to scale and there are licensing considerations, something rarely mentioned around these parts.

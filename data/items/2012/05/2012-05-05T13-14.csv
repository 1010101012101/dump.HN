I spend far more time than I'd like answering the same questions over and over again, even though I post several of those answers in the app description and on the website.

that I disagree with you that the outcome is set in stone.<p>It's a given that governments, backed by eternally backwards industries,
will try to attack innovative new technologies or business models
like Kickstarter that could threaten those industries. And
they will use ridiculous edge cases or contrived, hypothetical
threats to argue against them, and maybe achieve temporary
victories in the form of stupid laws.<p>And as I said, it will be futile. Innovation, in the end, will
win. Progress will eradicate those opposed to it, and reward the
ones who embrace it. Just like free sharing of information, art and
culture will eventually be accepted as one of the greatest
technological advancements in human history, and we'll deeply
regret the decades wasted fighting against it.",1336226126

Personally, I hate with passion systems where I can't search by multiple tags (tag1 + tag2, or tag1 - tag2). Frequently, it degenerates into a situation where a single tag is assigned to zillions of content and you have to review it all manually anyway. And if you leave tag creation completely open, you'll and up with tags ""dragon"", ""dragons"", ""one dragon"", ""two dragons"", ""half a dragon"",""dragoon"", ""fire breathing lizard"", used inconsistently of course.<p>I also don't buy the idea that everyone is going to use a tagging system.

There is so much that goes into creating an amazing site, and many would argue that ""programming"" is the least of it. I'm not suggesting programming is unimportant; I'm just pointing out that it is just one piece of many. And besides - the term ""programming"" is sort of being thrown about along with HTML and CSS. I don't really consider writing HTML or CSS to really be ""programming"" so I'd just sort of beware of some of the advice you're given. Are they important? Of course. But that's just one aspect of a site, just as ""programming"" might be just one part of ""site development"".<p>I wish I had links to share or book suggestions to provide but I don't really know of any that walk you through every aspect.

  SQL administration
  Front end design
  Front end image creation
  Front end coding (HTML, CSS, and wiring up lang./frameworks used)

3932108,comment,3928155,3931830,2,0,klodolph,,,"(3) My first problem is that most definitions for qualia I come across are back doors for dualism.  The second problem is that I'm not sure there's any point to discussing purely subjective phenomena, since a discussion by its nature requires objective description.<p>(4) I don't have an inner theater, or if I do, I don't call it that.  I have no idea what you are talking about.  I don't know how this relates to a supposed indivisibility of consciousness (I mean... how are we supposed to know it's indivisible, since we lack the technology to cut a brain up and split it between bodies, not to mention the ethical issues?  Am I supposed to trust you that it's indivisible?  And what about the evidence from split-brain patients?)<p>If anything, I perceive a very disjointed self.  For example, I feel like I have a distinctly single-threaded audio processor which can run independently of other functions.  I can play the piano and talk, but not at the same time, and when I'm doing other things quietly I get free background music in my head without using an iPod.  (I wouldn't call it inner theater.)<p>One reason we can't understand brains the way we understand cars is because the human brain is more complex by <i>many orders of magnitude</i>.  So saying our ""consciousness itself does not seem to be divisible in that way"" is not very convincing.  Microprocessors also don't seem to be divisible that way, but I've been assured that they are.  And another important difference is the processes that designed cars, microprocessors, and brains.  Part of the design criteria for cars and microprocessors is that they be easy to understand from understanding their parts.  The car is designed to be understood.<p>A better comparison might be circuits designed using powerful optimization algorithms.  A number of researchers have designed circuits using general purpose algorithms (such as genetic algorithms or swarm algorithms).  For all but the most basic end goals, the circuits are practically incomprehensible.  One researcher designed an analogue circuit to compute the cube of an input voltage, the resulting circuit defies understanding even though its components are clearly simple transistors.  Another researcher made a signal analysis circuit using an FPGA, the resulting mess was a technological marvel but not something you could understand by sitting down and looking at the schematic.  Given that the human brain is probably at least ten orders of magnitude more complicated, and created using an equally powerful optimization algorithm, there's no need to bring in quantum mechanics to explain why we don't understand the brain.<p>I think the major problem here is that too many people I meet have a narrow view of what it means to ""understand"" something.  We're used to understanding (a) simple things, like thrown rocks and (b) complicated things for which there exists significant neural machinery to analyze, such as used car salesmen.  As the things we try to understand become more and more complicated, the way we understand them becomes more and more like the Chinese room.<p>(5) Never said there was one electron.  I said that the two electrons were interchangeable.  I'm saying if you actually could clone someone to the extent necessary for Star Trek teleportation but forgot to dematerialize the original, then the label of ""clone"" and ""original"" is arbitrary.  To me, it seems a cop out to assume that everyone agrees that one is the clone and one is the original.<p>Could you clarify what you mean by ""confirmed by experiment"" and ""key part of the universe's workings""?  The problem here is that the subject of the sentence is ""it"", so I'd like to know exactly what is confirmed by which experiment, please.<p>I'd also like to hear how consciousness just ""falls out"" of quantum mechanics, since my current understanding of Newtonian mechanics is sufficient to me.  My theory is that I am a machine whose output is composed of deterministic parts and thermal noise, and I have yet to encounter experiences not explained by this theory.<p>As for string theory, its acceptance is hardly universal.",1336225720

Unfortunately, most bookstores carry a thin selection of good SciFi books. They have some of the latest books from well known authors, but rarely did they have some of their earlier titles.

One has kind of flopped so far - too wide a niche and it hasn't gotten on any external review sites yet. But the other floats between 500-1000th place in revenue in its category - one of the smaller categories. That's on track to bring in roughly $10,000 a year. Not bad for a first app that would take me a week or two to build now. That's not winning a lottery, but it's a business - a small business.<p>If you want to run a small business - on the web or in the app store, you need to target a narrow niche. It has to be narrow enough that there's not much well-established competition. It has to be wide enough that there's a profitable market. Then it has to be a market that's willing to spend money. It's not easy to identify those niches, but if you don't even try, you end up throwing out apps and hoping something happens. A class like Ed Dale's Challenge (free) is a big help in identifying niches and testing those markets: <a href=""http://www.challenge.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.challenge.co/</a>",1336224148

The first two mimic an iPhone 3G and an iPhone 4, and it shows, while the SIII really stands on its own (that's coming from someone who downright LOVES the iPhone 4 design). I wish they would have let go the metal on the side and went for a bit straighter lines on the long sides to make it feel more balanced, but really, it's fine.",1336224120

Patents still have a role in some industries where inventing is expensive and cloning is cheap (e.g. pharmaceuticals).  But on the web we don't need them.  They do more harm than good.

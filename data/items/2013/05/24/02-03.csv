My site isn't a portfolio, just a quick pitch that I can do the work that you need and that'll you be excited about. If you need samples I'll send something over. It's worked out well for me.

5761027,comment,5759357,5759711,3,0,mindcrime,,,"All joking aside, what are your ambitions?  Do you intend / desire to found a startup yourself? Do you want a job <i>in</i> a startup?  Do you want a nice, safe, boring corporate job? Do you want to be a consultant? Freelancer? Wall street hedge fund manager? Other?<p>Anyway, if you are at all interested in the startup world, want to live somewhere without all of the hubris and pomposity of the Bay Area, and somewhere with a reasonable cost-of-living and a nice climate, come check out the Triangle (Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill) area of North Carolina.<p>Despite what you may have heard, the entire state isn't a right-wing, christian fundamentalist, redneck backwater with nothing but hog farms, tobacco farms, and cotton.  The Triangle area is home to the largest research park in the world[1], and has a burgeoning startup scene[2], especially around the revitalized downtown Durham[3][4].  And we just had another tech IPO from a Triangle area company today[5].  Heck, we even had a local company win $50,000 on a CNBC reality show[6].<p>Seriously, there's a lot going on here and it's a pretty nice area to live in.  With all 3 of the vertices of the ""triangle"" being ""college towns"" to some extent (Durham: Duke U., Chapel Hill: UNC - Chapel Hill, Raleigh: NC State University) there are plenty of young people here, and with all the big companies in the park (IBM, Cisco, Glaxo, tons more) there is a very diverse and multi-cultural population as well. Durham/Chapel Hill rank as the #4 city on the ""most educated city in the US"" listings[7] as well.  And Wake County (Raleigh/Cary) has some of the best public schools in the country[8].  So, yeah, while the stereotypes about the South may have some truth to them, NC (especially this part) probably isn't anything like what you'd expect if you haven't been here (or aren't from here).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Triangle_Park"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Triangle_Park</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.downtowndurhamstartups.com/content/startup+directory/8880"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.downtowndurhamstartups.com/content/startup+direct...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://exitevent.com/rediscovering-durhams-startup-scene-10-years-later-13422.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://exitevent.com/rediscovering-durhams-startup-scene-10-...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://exitevent.com/index.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://exitevent.com/index.asp</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/23/channeladvisor-ipo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/23/channeladvisor-ipo/</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://blogs.newsobserver.com/food/pintful-mystery-brewing-wins-50000-in-cnbc-reality-tv-show"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.newsobserver.com/food/pintful-mystery-brewing-w...</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/08/30/the-10-most-educated-us-cities-boulder-ann-arbor-and-washington-dc-top-the-list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/08/30/the-10-most-e...</a><p>[8]: <a href=""http://www.greatschools.org/find-a-school/moving/slideshows/2287-top-public-schools-large-cities.gs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greatschools.org/find-a-school/moving/slideshows/...</a>",1369364256

Since the solutions you suggest have been considered and rejected in the past, one may assume that the operators of the site have a similar opinion. As a user, your response to that reality can take a number of forms. You can simply stop paying attention to HN, and probably cut down on the stress in your life. You can escalate your posting of this sort of opinion, which will probably have a different result.<p>I suggest that you pause to reconsider your opinions. The ""one-off flame"" you cite reads like something else to me. It is simply a request for everybody to stop encouraging the submission of uninteresting material to HN. As evidence to back up the request, the poster offers the proposition that your behavior and communications have annoyed many people for many years. I'm sure there are people on Earth who would disagree with that proposition, but they don't post much on HN. I don't mean that to be a judgment of you or of your life, and I doubt that redmarx meant it as such either. HN still isn't a place you'll find much sugar-coating. redmarx's post is just the truth, stripped of all the bullshit that accompanies it in less Aspergian environments, with a bit of vulgarity thrown in for color.<p>There is probably a response to all of that which wittily acknowledges the inherent criticism while subtly undercutting it. Suffice it to say that you haven't found that response yet.<p>If you prefer fora in which anonymity is discouraged, please try Facebook or Google Plus.<p>Thanks for your work on RSS!",1369364077

5761009,comment,5733078,5733078,1,0,Sealy,,,"I used to get RSI problems when I was younger. You have to understand that it is directly related to the amount of time you spend doing the repetitive task. In this case I'll assume its typing. (This affects a lot of people such as pianists and guitar players too)<p>When the pain was worse, I had a velcro wrist brace with a metal support, this helped as it limited movement. Ultimately, the solution to your problem is to simply reduce the amount of repetition if at all possible. Back in my most problematic years, I was a web developer who spent 9-5 coding and would return home every night to clock up 4-5 hours gaming.<p>Stretching movements do not help either, ie a lot of use from Shift + Control keys is bad - learn how to touch type properly using the action key on the opposite side of the keyboard to perform these operations.<p>Gaming is very bad. I would love playing FPS games and MMORPG's. FPS games force your finger movements to be very precise which is very straining. MMORPG's are notoriously bad for repetition. Give these up if you are suffering that badly, trust me, its not worth it.<p>Other things that might help? Well I personally have spent a lot of money finding the most comfortable keyboard + mouse setup. Don't buy based on what looks cool or gets the best reviews, get what is comfortable for you. For me, it is a small bluetooth apple keyboard (low travel laptop keys that have a light touch are MUCH less straining) and a Logitech MX anywhere mouse. Yes its a mobile mouse with no tail, this fits me much better and allows me to use a single battery which also makes it lighter to move about.<p>Good luck, and take a break!",1369363901

For those who didn't read it, the overall point was simply <i>focus</i> (don't get distracted with efforts that aren't directly contributing to your bottom line and measure your results so you can make informed decisions, honing in on what factually works for you).<p>Sure, Robert may have put a particular website in a bad light, isn't earning $1M, and maybe tried to find some value in some lessons from online courses (omg), but the point was clear: the competition was homogenous and he wanted to stand out (good). The best marketing strategy is to speak to your audience's needs, not necessarily your industry's ideals. I'm making a broad assumption here, but I feel like most business clients (those likely to hire an agency or a freelance designer) are more concerned with making themselves more money (through effective design) than ""looking pretty"". I think Robert was accurate in that observation.<p>Robert had some experience, found some stuff that worked for him, and is trying to share it with the community to help others learn where he maybe didn't have access to learn.

In fact, this happened only a month or so in to my new role.<p>Our mail server died.  Three out of four drives in the hardware RAID 10 failed.  I'd been seeing bounces to root@localhost from root@localhost in the nightly reports, but the way things were configured made it nearly impossible to figure out where the mails were coming from.  Thanks, Zimbra.  We speculate that these were constant alerts from our RAID card notifying us of the impending disaster.<p>Oh, and the only backups for the mail store were on the machine itself, and in the local Thunderbird installs that half the company used instead of the Zimbra web interface.  The machine was in a colo downtown, not local, and running backups over our pathetic little DSL connection was unmanageable.<p>Both of these things were known problems, both marked high priority, but both months away from being addressed when things went south.<p>This happened on a Friday.  By Monday morning, I'd moved us over to a hosted service, manually sorted all of the mail that hit a catch-all mailbox on a VM I'd set up.  By Tuesday, I'd audited every one of our other machines to make sure that mail to root was deliverable (it wasn't in about a dozen machines) and that every machine with hardware RAID had both local and remote monitoring.<p>Some people, including Directors and C-levels, lost up to ten years of mail.  It was the worst IT disaster the company ever faced.  But that's not the worst part.  No, the worst part is that we're in the IT industry, and knew the entire time that what we were doing was wrong... fixing it had just never been prioritized before, because it wasn't seen as <i>super urgent</i> that it be fixed.<p>That lesson has been learned.",1369361604

Google+ is truly a social layer across all Google services.<p>The average users who are just looking for a chicken recipe (as you mention) would always love to find the particular chicken recipe that their friends have recommended. Even more relevant to me (since I don't cook) is that if a friend  finds a todo app useful, I'd definitely want to know.<p>If Google has this social layer, it'll really unleash more expressive search results that would help the vast majority of users. This is what Google+ is.<p>Google+ is literally Google Plus More.<p>Of course, to get these benefits you really have to start using Google+ on different Google services. I guess this is the reason that Google employees who actually use Google+ services continue using it and prefer if their friends do it too.",1369360878

For example, you can't translate an if statement, so instead we implement our own branch command (<a href=""http://rethinkdb.com/api/#rb:control_structures-branch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rethinkdb.com/api/#rb:control_structures-branch</a>)<p>We overload operators when we can (unfortunately no operator overloading for Javascript folks) and it works really well.<p>You don't always get a great exception, but most of the time this turns out to be fine.

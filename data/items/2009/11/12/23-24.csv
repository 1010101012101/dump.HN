But so will many legitimate sites that want to provide a good user experience.  Is that really so bad?<p>I think that site speed does correlate with a better user experience.  A site that loads quickly shows that the person who made it cares about my experience more than a bloated site that takes forever to load.<p>I will admit that it's certainly not as as strong an indicator as the content, inbound links and other factors that are rumored to be part of PageRank but speed does matter.  All other things being equal, I would much rather visit a site that loads in 2 seconds than one that loads in 20 seconds.",1258070365

The distinctive thing here is that nerds are about language, and the good linguistic interfaces to the machine are mainly monospaced just by historical accident. It’s not like we’d invent it over again if we hadn’t thought of it until now.<p>Now that it’s established, of course, we’re all pretty much locked in. Most of the text on my screen right now is monospaced.

I just don't see you breaking out of the lifestyle-business loop. I believe that your technology will be your undoing - it will become so attractive to some outside entity that you will get swallowed up by them. I'm not sure if the technology - as-is - will be that valuable, but I'm assuming that you will iterate and adapt to the changing landscape. There is going to be demand for what you are creating - not for such trivial things as recommendations, but simply as data processing tools. There is going to be too much data, and the people who can structure it in whatever niche, will make good money.<p>The real question is this : will you guys be able to see the money when it comes? I, being an outsider, would not, but sometimes you can be so much of an insider that you don't see it either. You both seem pretty focused, and that's the big problem I see.<p>The final problem I see is this: you care about people liking you. I have the feeling pg likes you like he used to like sama. But the difference is that sama is ruthless and focused on making money - would you ever be able to? Can you bite the hand that fed you for the sake of the money?<p>Your recommendations system is small business and you will change it at some point. The new thing you build will be more interesting, I think.<p>That's my prediction! Let's see how many years I have to wait!",1258069484

However, we also have to allow for the very real fact that tables work pretty much exactly the same across all browsers, and allow for some very fine-tuned control over layout.<p>CSS, on the other hand, is implemented differently from browser to browser. Depending on the layout, sometimes that's a problem, and sometimes it isn't so much, but it still requires specialized knowledge of CSS and browser-specific quirks.<p>...to say nothing of all the various css ""hacks"" that are out there.<p>Given a complicated site layout, I think I'd rather crawl through some table code than crawl through pages and pages of complicated CSS where declarations at the bottom of the file are subtly dependent on declarations at the top of the file.<p>Also, let's not forget that CSS was <i>not</i> intended for layout. When it was designed, it was designed for specific purposes, and it's since been warped into a layout language.<p>So, sure, in principle, I agree that it's better to keep your HTML clean and meaningful, and hide the complexity in a separate CSS file.<p>But let's not pretend that some designers will save time by switching to CSS only, or that CSS-only is simpler, or that there's anything intrinsically bad about using tables for layout, or that developers have no reason for doing so.",1258069407

939016,comment,938508,938937,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think you and I have talked about this in the past. From what I know of the process and where ECMAScript 4 was going, I am not of the opinion that anything particular great has been lost by its falling apart.<p>JavaScript/ECMAScript evolution has not stopped just because a design-by-committee extension effort failed. There are a few issues with JavaScript for programming in the large, but they won't last.  More importantly, perhaps, I think that <i>even if</i> they weren't being fixed at a rapid clip, JavaScript would still end up an extremely popular language, probably even the most popular language, for many classes of problem. Web applications, in particular, but most applications will be web applications in the future, so the planets are aligning for JavaScript.<p>I will also add that damned near every major technology company has some sort of serious JavaScript effort underway, as we speak. Google, Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, are all extremely serious about JavaScript.  Several well-funded teams are building JavaScript engines, some of which are not tied to a particular browser or limited to only running within a browser. Perl and Python will <i>never</i> have that kind of money behind them. Java was in the same position 15 years ago, but it was never a particularly good language for the Perl and Python market (as evidenced by the fact that dynamic language programmers tend to hate, or merely tolerate Java). JavaScript, on the other hand, not only had incredible corporate backing, it also has a large amount of nerd mindshare. Most of the Perl, Python, Ruby, etc. hackers I know don't mind working in JavaScript, and find it a pretty nice language. I certainly enjoy it. Sure, it is lacking a lot of niceties of those other languages, but with the kind of money and effort being spent on JavaScript, it won't be long before those issues disappear.<p>So, while Java took over the programming marketplace for several years, to the sound of much gnashing of teeth by dynamic language programmers, it never really won mindshare among the folks who programmed for enjoyment (FOSS, in particular). I don't think JavaScript will run into those impediments. It's a good language, and a few nitpicks about missing features or misfeatures aren't going to stop it from being a juggernaut that rolls over most other dynamic languages in terms of popularity.",1258068976
939015,story,,,5,0,neo,"Facebook canvas app vs. FB Connect/Platform?",,"Given the latest Facebook announcements affecting developers, how would you weigh the pros/cons of betting on doing a Facebook canvas app as your user's primary means of interacting with your application (as opposed to going to your own domain which would then use FB Connect for login and other the FB API for other features such as friend picker, constant auth, profile sharing, etc.)?<p>Some context: we're a social advice & reputation game.<p>By my calculation, it seems that the only a few benefits for developers in doing FB canvas apps anymore:<p>1) User doesn't have to open another browser window/tab to a site whose domain/brand they're not immediately familiar with.<p>2) If the user bookmarks the app, the app appears in the upcoming left profile/nav bar.<p>3) Presumably, I'd expect the new ""secret sauce"" FB newsfeed algorithm to include some preference towards native FB canvas app stories that can then be ""liked"" & commented upon from within the user's newsfeed/live feed.<p>A very prominent FB app company (top 20) told me that they're deprioritizing their native FB canvas app in lieu of their own site with FB Connect given they expect a ""40-60% decline in native FB canvas app user activity with Facebook's recently announced changes"".

For example, when the community voted to ban valleywag stories.<p>That said, rather than starting meta discussions I prefer to submit good content. I felt like writing a rant about the state of HN last week, but I submitted a paper on red-black trees in Haskell instead. It seems like a more constructive approach.",1269269824

Arguments against illegal immigration do not apply here.<p>So, if an investor actually invests in a startup with a foreign founder, just give that person a green card or a long visitor's visa depending on what he wants (I assume not everyone wants to move to the US).

He had 14 hours of surgery to remove an eye socket and half of the top of his jaw and then rebuild it with titanium and hip bone. 10+ weeks of radiation treatment. They're about to start what is technically cosmetic surgery, to give him new teeth and tighten up the side of his face they've been working on. He's back at work now, but he had about 4 months off work.<p>The cost of the medical treatment? A few thousand for sundry expenses. Australia's Medicare system picked up the tab for virtually all of it. He asked them the face value (hoho!) of the treatments, but no one was really sure how to work it out - it's at least 6 figures. I dread to think what it would have cost in the US...<p>He didn't lose his house or car. The baby that was born during his treatment didn't bankrupt anyone.

I know the OP advises against that (and agreed, you shouldn't get too personal/involved) but an informal lunch with <i>all</i> the candidates together can be a great ice breaker and a way to judge their personality/interests etc.",1269266667

Fast forward to a wee bit ago: it turns out that tortured brooding artists who sweat music and visual design are Kinda Popular Among iPhone Owners.

If you bet on a stock by buying 500 shares, the stock goes up ten cents (USD, $0.10), you've made $50 (I'm not counting transaction fees, just the base numbers). If you buy 5000 shares you've made $500. Make $500 three times a month and you're at $18,000 a year. Each $500 gamble may take one or two hours depending on how quickly the NASDAQ is moving.<p>For the specified amount of $24,000 per year, that's four $500 bets per month.<p>Mike",1269266418

This still evaluates to true, but I believe it has to do with the rules of shadowing. If you change the declaration to 'var name=""bob"";' it will return false.",1269266402

I also tried some other sites that do crawl a website but they had a limit of 2-300 links and then it would stop. You would then have to buy an app that was a bit expensive.<p>I'm thinking a web app where you can point it at your site and just receive a report when it's done.<p>Would anyone need something like this ?",1255167060
873143,comment,873081,873081,0,0,vicaya,,,"Yet another Dynamo/DHT. Now I've seen implementations in Java (Dynamo, Cassandra, Voldemort), Perl (Blekko) and now Erlang. I wonder if any of these has been used on >1000 node cluster? I haven't seen any mention of checksums (besides those in TCP) to ensure that switch/router would not corrupt data (including cluster states), like Amazon learned the hard way.<p>Of course, they don't support range scan efficiently either. A proper Bigtable implementation is much harder, I guess :)",1255166673

Why not VCs/angels have to pay to pitch us?<p>Bottom line is, if you pay to pitch an investor, you are are identifying yourself as a desperate, naive, uninformed person, and possibly greedy person (read on).  You will be fleeced, some might say you deserve to be fleeced.<p>These ""pay to pitch"" scams work on the same kind of people as those Nigerian email scams (or other ""get rich quick"" scams).  The reason both of them exist is because there are enough twits out there that click or pay or whatever.  And, so, the rest have to hear about it and get spammed by it.",1255166639
873141,comment,870240,871976,0,0,antirez,,,"No I mean, when the first version if gimp was created to copy photoshop was not a good idea. And actually is not natural at all to split an application into multiple windows. To just do the obvious (single window) was a better alternative even when they started :) but sometimes it's hard to follow your own ideas if you see that the absolute leader (photoshop) is doing something different.",1255166290

873137,comment,872860,872941,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Yes. Instant streaming (or high-quality, lossy compression) is more important than HD. HD is worthwhile on a subset of material (do you really need the simpsons in 1080p?) while lowering the hurdles for watching any video media is valuable for almost everything (TV, movies, etc.)<p>According to the intertrons, a total of $750 million was spent on blu-ray discs in 2008 in the US. Netflix's instant streaming service alone brings in at least a 10th of that revenue if not more, and the library is still relatively small. More importantly, streaming is growing much faster than blu-ray adoption, so it's easy to see where these trends are headed.",1255165638

If someone has a deeper problem of more than just ""I don't think this will work and I don't agree with what you're doing"" kindly let me know.",1255165532

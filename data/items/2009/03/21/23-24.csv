(She still says ""So can I X-this out?"" to close a window.)<p>I sat her down one afternoon and explained things <i>very</i> slowly, using <i>metaphors</i> such as the postman bringing mail to your house, and you putting mail in your mailbox when you want it to go out at some point.<p>For the internet, I used the metaphor that ""your computer talks to other computers"" and shows you pages that live on other computers. I had to explain about hyperlinks, ads, etc.<p>The key point to remember: They're not stupid; the internet is completely foreign to them. You have to explain things that we take for granted, such as hyperlinks, the windows taskbar, what a ""window"", ""application"", etc are.<p>Technical details: I put her in Chrome, and added a shortcut to her start menu for Gmail.

Invention is hard.<p>In the hypothetical case that everything is gone tomorrow, the ideas still exist. All we need to do is implement them.<p>I'll explain it in CS terms. What would happen if all copies of the quicksort algorithm were destroyed overnight? Someone would spend a few hours and write another one because he/she knows about the algorithm. It would take about an hour.<p>Consider the further case that no one on earth knew that the quicksort algorithm even existed. How long would it take to be duplicated? Months? Years?<p>How did someone get the idea to smelt metal? It took thousands of years. Now that we know that smelting exists, all that is left is finding a way to do it.

Take away all manmade technology (including buildings, tarmac, concrete) and any city would be many square miles of bare earth collapsing into holes where sewers and tunnels and underground trains once were.<p>Within a day or two it would be many square miles of human waste, corpses, mud if it rained, and people making their way to the nearest rivers.<p>Within a couple of weeks, significant fractions of people have starved or died of lack of medical treatment, fighting, illness from river water contaminated with sewage and corpses, etc.<p>OK, you can drink from the river you may not get ill for a while. What can you eat but other people? City areas -> wastelands.<p>Out in the country, farmers with easily harvested crops in season are the best off, until they get looted. With no food stores or shops, animals and current crops will be eaten quickly and that's pretty much that. Good luck surviving on hedgerow food and hunting with no experience and everyone else trying to as well.<p>Some strong willed resourceful people in remote niches will survive (nobody could travel to them very quickly). After a few years we'll see who. Small farms, maybe some farm animals, fast growing trees coming into usable sizes. Levers, (wooden) wheels, barrows, hammers hoes, heaters, cookers, flint/stone axes, they'll be around.<p>Maybe in short order some beach sand melting -> glass jars, glasses. The people who survive are the people who currently live with reduced technology and will be busy staying alive.<p>What then? I don't know. A few decades to a population big enough and connected enough for mass trade, I suppose. By then a similar sort of grind up through metalwork, blacksmithing, banking, debt, economic collapse...<p>What technology could we skip to that would hasten us through such developments?

I wrote an article in December at SitePoint about tips for staying sane while working from home... there is likely a lot of overlap, as I know instituting a lot of the ideas presented in that article have also helped to keep me from burning out at whatever I happen to be working on.<p>The most relevant tips were:<p>-Clearly define your work space.  Making sure your work and personal life stay separate and don't start to blur is a good way to avoid burn out.  If your work life spills over into your non-work life too much you'll start to feel like you're at work 24/7 ... that's a one way ticket to burn out city.<p>-Have lunch with a friend / join a local user group.  Or, in short: have a personal life.  All work and no play, yadda yadda yadda.  You need to make sure you aren't _just_ working.<p>-Take regular breaks / schedule time off.  Again, take some time to actively NOT work and you'll be less likely to burn out on whatever work you're doing.<p>-Get a cat (or a dog).  Seriously, my cat provides hours of entertainment and (surprisingly for a cat) plenty of affection.  That's very helpful for keeping me sane and ultimately keeping me happy and focused on my work.<p>Full article for anyone interested is here: <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2008/12/19/12-ways-to-keep-sane-while-working-from-home/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2008/12/19/12-ways-to-keep-sa...</a>",1237677769

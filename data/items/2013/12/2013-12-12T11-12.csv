6893986,comment,6886125,6893423,1,0,jokoon,,,"> Yes.\n> Although the insecure design of C and C++ (thanks to its C underpinnings) are just an attack vector from many possible ones, it is quite easy to get exploited thanks to the skills of many people writing applications on those languages.<p>You can&#x27;t have both performance AND remove the chances programmers will make mistakes. A tool is a tool with its compromises, you can&#x27;t have all the advantages.<p>> Removing away the possibility of out of bounds errors and pointer misuse, not possible in other safer systems programming languages, already removes away many of those attacks.<p>Then don&#x27;t use pointers, or learn how to use them properly. You should not hack into pointers anyway, there are never good reason to do so, both for risks of bugs and reduced code re-usability. STL containers make pointer use already quite almost irrelevant.<p>And if it&#x27;s only C, not C++, I&#x27;d argue that C is quite an old system language. Security is an expensive feature, and you&#x27;re free to code faster without minding security if the business you&#x27;re doing allows it.<p>The better solution in all this, is using solutions like Cython, or make tools that allows easier bindings with C++ libraries. It doesn&#x27;t change the fact that often, you&#x27;ll need to optimize a part of your code, and you&#x27;ll need to make a C/C++ library out of it, which you&#x27;ll link against. All this process is quite not standard, and will cost time and learning, because it&#x27;s quite painful. Security is often not worth the effort. Often it&#x27;s much more easier to make sure users are using secure applications and securing your network and teaching users about security, than hire a security expert to review your code.<p>And by the way, if someone hack into your system and steal stuff, it&#x27;s still a criminal act, it&#x27;s not the fault of the guy who decided to use C++ because he needed speed.",1386849418

6893979,comment,6893756,6893756,10,0,beloch,,,"I&#x27;m probably going to regret this, but let&#x27;s accept the premise that programming languages are both gendered and a product of &quot;the patriarchy&quot; (Sorry, Grace.).<p>How far down does the patriarchy go?  Are programming languages like C and Java, which were almost all created by men with awesome beards, inherently patriarchal?  As the products of male minds, this is possible.  What about assembler?  Well, it&#x27;s pretty much dictated by the design of the processor, which is based upon older processors, and even older processors, etc..  Women helped create these, but they were in the minority.<p>The foundations of computing are math and physics.  We exploit the laws of physics to build transistors, and combine these to form flip-flops, gates, etc..  The basic logic that computers are built of is dictated by math.  No matter how far I stretch, I just can&#x27;t see anything gendered in transistors, logic gates, 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s.  If you insist that this is not the case, then you are asking for a new branch of feminist science that has nothing in common with the science we know.  Good luck!<p>Next, we can build computer out of our basic pieces.  Modern computers are big, complex, beasts, and there is certainly room for the masculine mind to assert itself in how a processor is built.  However, we can abstract things a little.  Let&#x27;s just stick to turing machines.  Is a turing machine a product of the patriarchy?  If no, we can abstract a language and build it to run on a turing machine, which can then be simulated by the processors of the patriarchy, and we&#x27;re off!  If yes, you need to invent a fundamentally new basis for classical computing theory.  Good luck!<p>Okay, so if you believe me so far, it should be possible to build a male-cootie free language on top of a simulated turing machine. That&#x27;s doable...<p>Okay.  I&#x27;m done.  Honestly, I think this kind of study is akin to literary criticism.  i.e. It&#x27;s a lot of pretentious wanking (Sorry about using the crass sexual argot of the patriarchy).  However, the essence of academia is throwing a lot of random stuff at the wall to see what sticks, and if some of it&#x27;s a bit fruity, hey, why not?  Fruit can stick to stuff.",1386849301

The former of course is something like a reference count and a pointer to a string elsewhere; the latter would have some overhead when strings are of varying lengths.  If memory usage were really a concern, decent savings could be realized by changing (most of?) the 13 float64 columns to float32, and some of the object (string) columns to fixed-width.  For example, &quot;lang&quot; is two characters always, and usernames (which are stored in several fields) would be more efficiently stored as char[15].  Easy to try, just not the default behavior; I bet you could cut the total size by a third (too bad they didn&#x27;t).",1386848980

6893951,comment,6893571,6893571,1,0,nationcrafting,,,"I&#x27;ve often thought about the bribery that occurs in Peru (and, presumably, many other countries) when a policeman stops your car for some minor infraction, to accept a bribe in exchange for letting you go without a ticket.<p>The usual thinking is that this is bribery and that it is corrosive on the morals of society.<p>But, the way I see it, this system is actually a better system for price discovery than the legal route.  In other words, it&#x27;s a better and more efficient system for finding out what the price of a minor infraction should be.<p>If you think about it, the official penalty for an infraction is set by a small committee of people claiming to represent the people by being voted into power or through some other democratic method.<p>But, the quality of information available to this small committee is much lower than the aggregate information the market has in its totality.  The price signals that dictate the amount of a bribe are therefore best emitted by the market itself.  Some groups in the market will want the price to be higher, others will want it to be lower.  If general society drives well, without infractions, the policeman will be forced by market forces to charge a higher bribe to the few that drive badly, which means that the price will reflect accurately how people view the act of driving badly.  Similarly, if a lot of people drive badly, the bribe will be lower, again reflecting the fact that society doesn&#x27;t see bad driving as something that should be heavily penalised.<p>So, in this particular sector at least, you could argue that the bribe system is actually more just and representative of the will of the people than any arbitrary penalty system decided by its legal representatives.",1386848393

6893930,comment,6893756,6893756,12,0,rjknight,,,"I think there&#x27;s a confusion here, but it&#x27;s a very interesting one.  This article raises the question: &#x27;where do our ideas about what programming languages should be like come from?&#x27;<p>The genesis of functional programming is obvious from its name - it is based on the mathematical concept of functions, and languages which are described as &#x27;functional&#x27; try to remain close to the ideal of emulating mathematical functions, such that concepts which work in mathematics can be applied in computer programming.  There are limits, of course - we need to interact with the world (state) and we have limits on the kinds of things that we can feasibly compute which do not exist in abstract mathematics, but the general principle holds.<p>Object-oriented programming does involve the assumption that we have a system which can be described as a set of objects interacting with each other, which can respond to requests from the user&#x27;s program.  The OP is arguing that this forces the programmer to see the <i>world</i> as a set of objects interacting with each other, or to <i>objectify</i> the world or things in it, in a manner that feminists have long seen as problematic (I don&#x27;t personally see it as problematic per se, but this is not about me).  The OP then suggests that a feminist programming language would offer a different paradigm of non-object-oriented programming.<p>I can think of a few critiques, of varying quality:<p>- There&#x27;s a difference between object-oriented programming (how to structure a computer program) and object-oriented analysis and design (how to decompose the world into objects in order to represent the world within a computer program).  The two tend to go together, but do not have to, and it is perfectly possible to program in an object-oriented manner without objectifying real-world things, e.g. people.  The &#x27;Person&#x27; object is a very common example in texts teaching people about object-oriented design, but is quite uncommon in real-world programming.<p>- I can, in a certain light, see how feminism and object-oriented analysis might be in tension.  I am less clear on how functional programming and feminism might be in tension, but would very much like to know.<p>- I am not sure that calling this language &#x27;feminist&#x27; is necessarily a good idea, since one could of course find it to be an excellent programming language without sharing any of the tenets of feminism, and the label actually obscures a lot more than it reveals in this context.  It&#x27;s certainly going to lead to a lower-quality HN thread than if this were a discussion purely about novel programming paradigms.<p>- Of course, one may simply disagree that there&#x27;s anything particularly wrong with objectification, but at this point we&#x27;re no longer talking about programming languages.<p>On the other side, this might turn out to be really interesting!  We&#x27;re nowhere near having discovered all of the possible paradigms that might underpin a programming language, and new ideas should be welcomed.  The only way to know if a feminist programming language is a good idea is for someone to create one and demonstrate how it can be used.  On longer time horizons, many of our current assumptions about how programming works may have to be discarded - the von Neumann architecture and the idea of deterministic, predictable results from computation may prove impossible to scale for certain requirements, so we might have to embrace programming languages that deal better with contradictions and the inability to &#x27;cleanly&#x27; categorise things.  If feminism&#x27;s outsider status makes it easier for feminists to think heretical thoughts about computation then perhaps we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if feminists are a good source of ideas about these things.  (Nor, of course, should we pigeonhole feminists or women in general as purely contradictory thinkers, valuable only insofar as they challenge established paradigms!)<p>EDIT: formatting",1386847988

There is great scholarship talking about weather a feminist logic can build off of formal logic or if it has to reject the laws of identity and create something entirely new. There are solid arguments for both camps, personally I’m swayed by the constructive theories that would build onto formal logic through a feminist lens. There exist logics that handle contradiction as part of the system, namely paraconsistent logic.

It ignores aspects such as self-awareness, self-consciousness and self-censorship. Notice a lot of &#x27;self&#x27;s in the previous sentence? A diary is a very personal thing. When you are writing in your diary you poor your heart out about everything and anything. You can do this because you are the only person who will ever read this stuff. Imagine writing something that other people will read, like your mom (anything sex-related is out of the question), your colleagues (better not say your boss is a total jerk), your friends (don&#x27;t mention that secret Anne told you about Peter, or you wlll lose 2 friends) or your government (no wait, they already know everything anyway).<p>Similar things happen when you are writing code for yourself and yourself only. When I write code for my own pleasure. I don&#x27;t care so much about documentation, clarity, robustness, polish, etc. Yes, I am a bad, bad person. Anyway, compare writing code for yourself with code you share with friends (generally supportive, but add some polish and fix that hack so they don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re a complete idiot), colleagues (semi-critical yet supportive, maybe try to score some bonus points using a FactorySingletonVisitorBean) or hackerne.ws (super-critical, probably rewrite it in the language-du-jour first, prepare to be burned at the stake anyway).",1386847053

Pre-computing massive amounts of data on instance startup sounds like they don&#x27;t have the correct mindset. Since every new instance starts from the same state, it must be true that whatever is being computed is, in fact, the same for each instance. This is a bunch of work which should be offloaded to a task once (or on a schedule) and saved somewhere like blob storage. Then each new instance can just load that precomputed data without having to duplicate the work that has already been done. I&#x27;m guessing that this lengthy computation is the search index which they reference elsewhere. They also complain that datastore reads are quite slow. Presumably if new instances are building a search index, they will be churning through lots of datastore queries which degrades performance and raises costs.<p>Bubblesort is slow on App Engine too, and you&#x27;d do much better switching to a different sort algorithm on EC2 as well. Every platform has a way to shoot yourself in the foot. Perhaps the solution isn&#x27;t to move off, but to just <i>not do that</i>.

For a start, the largest groups of investors are pension funds storing aggregate savings of normal workers.  For a second, even when companies like Apple hoard cash, it&#x27;s not just sitting in a Cupertino vault.  It is in a bank account, and that bank is then lending the money out for other uses.<p>Your example also assumes that businesses automatically get to keep surplus earnings through cost savings.  This may. Be true in some cases but overall will be dictated by the elasticity of the market they are in.  Most markets face significant competition, and so most of the benefits of automation flow through to the customers, who then either get a better product for the same price, or the same product for less.  This leaves them with more cash to spend on other things, which, coupled with innovation and newly freed resources, as well as surplus capital, creates entirely new businesses and jobs.  This cycle has repeated many times over many centuries and is likely to continue unless capital formation, entrepreneurship and market freedom are messed with.<p>Every generation has a quota of Luddites who think that this time things will really turn out for the worse,  but he evidence doesn&#x27;t support that theory.",1386846031

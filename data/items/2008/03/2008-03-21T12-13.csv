142375,comment,142277,142277,0,0,vitaminj,,,"Disclosure: I work in the oil industry and have worked for ExxonMobil in the past.<p>ExxonMobil may be the world's largest publicly traded oil company, but it is nowhere near the largest oil producer, nor does it have the the largest reserves. These honours go to the state-owned oil companies eg. saudi aramco, PDVSA (venezuela), NIOC (iran), CNPC (china), kuwait petroleum, etc. To give an example, in 2004, saudi aramco had proven oil reserves of 261 billion barrels, iran, iraq had around 130 billion each. Meanwhile exxon had 22 billion. Even the state-owned comapnies in nigeria, qatar and libya have more proven reserves than exxon.<p>My take on this: the rhetoric seems to be about return on capital, and betting on high future oil prices. But I strongly suspect the real reason for ExxonMobil not producing more oil (and the story alluded to this) is that there haven't been any major new fields discovered to grow beyond replacing their existing depleted fields. Also, the large new discoveries have typically been deepwater, which is difficult and expensive with current technology.<p>In my experience with Exxon, they are astute managers when it comes to their investments, but ultimately they are an oil company. Unlike most of the other big oil players (BP, Shell, Chevron, Total), Exxon has openly said that it is in the oil and gas business only and won't diversify to alternative energy sources (eg. BP has started tagging their brand Beyond Petroluem with investments in ethanol and other renewables). So I certainly don't think they are holding off on projects simply to leverage higher prices in future.",1206104333

Ender's Game book seem to argue the opposite: that giving general orders to a group while leaving the implementation details to each member is the best of both worlds.<p>[Remember the school master Graff describing to Ender the hierarchical army he had built with his toon leaders: moving in synchrony, yet each piece showing initiative and creativity -as opposed to the single-minded, single-track insector army lead by a single queen.]",1206102866

142367,comment,142239,142239,0,0,ericb,,,"I had a great part-time setup for a while. I left a job, and they called to see if I'd come back. At that point I was in a good enough position to negotiate the arrangement. Eventually, a pointy haired boss decided that I ""had to go full time."" Sad part is, I'm not sure if the extra 2 days upped my productivity much. When I knew I only had to do it for 3 days a week, I was a rock star for those 3 days. Eventually, the extra days caused me to leave years sooner than I would have.<p>I agree with marrone and tjr, if you're looking for part-time right off, be upfront about it. It helps if you have specialized knowledge, or a skill that will make up for not being full time.",1206102006

After thinking about it for a while though, I started to have doubts, at least about his time frames.<p>You are right about the information singularity though, I still trip over how <i>easy</i> it is.  I remember my earlier computing experiences back in the 80s with the commodore; the computer was a toy.  Even back in 91 with my crash-prone 
Mac classic; it was still a toy.  Then in 96 people kept talking about this ""Internet"".  I went to a PC at my school,
typed in a few words and <i>answers</i> came back.  At that moment I thought <i>Holy s---, it happened without me.</i><p>In  a way, I've been in that state of shock ever since.",1206101524

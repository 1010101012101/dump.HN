There&#x27;s a lot of comments (which is great), but even with that, the code just seems incredibly <i>massive</i> to me for what it is (over 2800 lines and 100KB, of course it has a lot of great commenting in there as well.)<p>If there really is no way to reduce the complexity (or at least without ruining the performance), then I understand. I know code size isn&#x27;t a particularly important metric, I just find code that&#x27;s been reduced to its raw essence a lot easier to understand and learn from than over-architected, over-abstracted code.<p>I ask because this is something I&#x27;m interested in understanding (I want to write a nice thread-safe allocator), but the code even with the comments and article is fairly overwhelming to me at the moment.<p>Either way, great job on making this! Really impressive performance metrics, too.",1415444222

8576522,comment,8575938,8576440,0,0,Roritharr,,,"This is a great story. My mother has worked on german trains as a waitress for the past 46 years (retired this year) and she has so many awesome stories about the cold war, east germany crossing and so on.<p>She is not a history nut at all so from her point of view these were just things that happened or that she did, not something bigger. 
But she:
- shook the hand of three separate Bundeskanzlers
- smuggled Nylon Socks, Coca-Cola and Candy Bars to East Berlin
- served on a train that was driving completely in secret, on board were politicians and military personelle(they tipped well she said)
- served on a train on which German terrorists(RAF/Baader Meinhof, can&#x27;t remember which ATM) were captured<p>Besides working on a train she:
- worked in the olympic town in Munich 1972 and served some of the Israeli athletes.<p>For my mother nothing of this is extrodinary and these bits seep out when she talks about &quot;good tipping customers&quot; or annoying workplace conditions. When I ask her for something exciting, she tells me stories of how the onboard cook made ad hoc dessert in 3 minutes for some poor Hungarian border patrol guard...<p>Talking to my mother is my very own german version of Forrest Gump. All of post-war German History is in there, I just have to ask the wrong questions. I&#x27;m so proud of her.",1415443641
8576520,comment,8575152,8576395,0,0,byuu,,,"I found a cool trick around that recently. Use anonymous namespaces when you want to have &quot;standard-library/boost&quot;-like template header libraries. Anything inside of an anonymous namespace has no external linkage, and it can transparently use anything inside its parent namespace.<p>For instance:<p><pre><code>    namespace nall { namespace {
      void foo() {
      }
    }}
</code></pre>
You can include this in multiple compilation units, invoke it with nall::foo(), and have no issues with multiple symbols.<p>(and of course as rav said, as long as you put the function definition inside the class definition, that can also work. But my trick will work if you want the functions declared outside the class, or want non-class functions.)",1415443371

When I&#x27;m writing, I block everything out but the writing prompt, occasionally backing out to open up character/location/backstory notes. When I&#x27;m writing a bash or python script, I do much the same. Full screen my terminal, open up vi, and don&#x27;t leave it until I&#x27;m done or have other matters to attend to. And the same with when I&#x27;m learning something - I have my study materials, and that&#x27;s it. (Though, I&#x27;m weird and still prefer physical books for learning stuff, so I might not have a computer near me at all, despite &quot;pleasure&quot; reading being almost 100% done on my kindle)<p>But most of the time I&#x27;m on the job, I am not sitting there with singular focus on one window. I&#x27;m not a professional author or developer. Multitasking - whether or not humans are good at it - makes up a huge portion of my day to day time. I have the general projects I have to work on, but I&#x27;m also an escalation point - I have to keep an eye on IRC and see if anyone needs me, or has questions about anything. I have to keep my eye on my email for similar reasons. I have to be signed in to our other office communication systems that other departments use in case they need to get ahold of me, or connect me with a customer. etc etc etc. For me, being productive much of the time precisely means I need to be bouncing my focus all over the place and be juggling multiple things at once.<p>I get the overall point, and agree with it for many cases, but there are plenty of jobs out there where having a lot of different information feeds presented to you at once is part of how you attain productivity.",1415442575

This is convenient when you have small isolated processes, but completely prevents Go adoption in other environments.<p>I&#x27;m working in an electronic design automation software system which is basically a large number of C/C++ shared libraries/plugins loaded into a Tcl interpreter which you do <i>not</i> want to rewrite (lots of tricky and finely tuned optimization and design analysis algorithm).<p>Go is not a good fit in this environment because of its all-or-nothing attitude. Rust, on the other hand, is fairly easy to imagine as an addition to the toolset from a purely technological point of view (ignoring the social and management issues which add a huge amount of inertia).

1065894,comment,1065770,1065830,0,0,lmkg,,,"I am a mathematician myself, and I have some of the same problems when learning about topics away from my experience, or over my head. Wikipedia is great for cherry-picking topics if you're already familiar with them, but math is a subject that really builds on foundations of previous concepts (arguably, that's all it is). Wikipedia's content organization doesn't lend itself well to ""entry points"" nor to the partial ordering of topics.<p>Until you get some foundational knowledge, math is one of the topics where you're better off using traditional textbooks than wikipedia. The information is arranged in a logical manner that builds on previous concepts. Unfortunately, most individual topics are better-explained in wikipedia than in most books. A suitable compromise might be using a textbook's table of contents as the order to follow in navigating wikipedia, but the articles also have the problem of not always being consistent with each other, in style, nomenclature, required knowledge, and point of view.<p>After about one semester's worth each of algebra and analysis, you would probably have enough working knowledge to at least not stumble around like a blind man on 50% of topics. My personal favorite analysis textbook was Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis, however it's... not for the feint of heart. Seriously. It could kill a man. If you want to get the full value out of that book, you will be spending over an hour per page to make sure you understand every step of every argument.",1264024526

I have really wanted to use cross-site http requests, but I'm having some trouble understanding certain decisions here.<p>Why are they using a new set of HTTP headers to describe scenarios that are already covered by HTTP response codes?  Why does the client send an Origin header at all in the first place, when it can be inferred from the referer?  Why does the server respond with a list of allowed origins, when it could simply send an HTTP response code to say allowed/not allowed/auth required/etc.<p>I'm probably missing something, but this just doesn't add up...<p>EDIT:<p>Oh - maybe because there isn't a good javascript interface to HTTP response codes?

1065890,comment,1065350,1065350,0,0,qjz,,,"It's funny, I thought this was an odd choice when the winner was originally announced. I felt the judges were overly moved by the presence of a human element (the fence) in the shot, especially considering the emphasis on wildlife photography. I doubt if bears in a dump would have been considered, or monkeys on a safari vehicle. But I think this shot evoked a certain fairytale imagery in the minds of the judges, and they let themselves be led by their emotional response without fully considering the criteria. The strange thing is that the rules don't necessarily invalidate the image, even if the allegations are true. Images using models are allowed, but must be declared. If he had declared that he used a model (and it's still not proven that he did), his photo would still be eligible. Besides, some of the leading wildlife photographers/videographers in the world use elaborately staged sets (ant colonies set behind glass, known tame animals in game preserves, etc.) to achieve more ""realistic"" images.

So you could be strong (of character) in an area, or average, or weak. On that notion, I don't believe that quality women are more forgiving of weakness - just the opposite actually.<p>Could you elaborate on this? I find a woman to be higher 'quality' if she is forgiving of weakness. But maybe I'm just interpreting the words 'strong/weak' in the wrong way. Perhaps you meant to say that 'quality' women value integrity. In that case I would agree with you.",1264023765

Finite element software, for example, spends nearly all its time solving linear equations.<p>If I remember correctly, it's not that all these problems are actually sets of linear sub-problems. We just are a lot more apt to think in terms of linear equations, making it so that we tend to break down any problem we have to a linear problem.

The concept of a ""soft maximum,"" the principles behind calculating it, and its startling similarity to a hard maximum, are all fascinating and exciting to me.  Look at that!  Two completely separate functions, and such magical results.  According to this post, it's useful for ""convex optimization.""  I clicked through to the ""related post,"" which was merely a comment about someone else's opinions on ""convex optimization,"" so I looked it up on Wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization</a><p>Ah!  A technique used to ""minimize convex functions.""  Maybe some of this notation will make sense to me if I understand the underlying concept of whatever a ""convex function"" is.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_functions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_functions</a><p>Great. An entire article that is completely and utterly meaningless to me.  I mean, absolutely nothing in that article--oh!  ""Convex sets?""  That looks promising.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set</a><p>Jackpot!  The pretty pictures make the idea of a convex set clear to me.  Unfortunately, by now I'm 4 clicks away, and my actual understanding of the subject is clearly just scratching the surface.  Connecting my newfound--and obviously still naive--understanding of convexity* to ""soft maximums,"" which initially inspired this search, feels dumbfoundingly impossible.<p>Am I approaching this all wrong?  Am I expecting too much?  Thinking too little?  I would love to understand more about this subject, and I have tried to learn it the same way I learned how to program: by Googling and working on my own problems.  However, the resources simply don't seem to be there in the same way.  What's the deal, here?<p>* Would it be more accurate to say ""Euclidian convexity?"" What would that mean, exactly?",1264022682

I can give you a few things to think about.<p>First and foremost, the chain to which we belong just got out of a long fight with a large Online Travel Agency [OTA].  During this ""fight"", the chain really noticed that OTA's had a stranglehold on the online room distributions, especially the rates so in response, they have ""initiated"" some policies to nip that in the butt. (OTA's are currently killing Vegas)<p>I will show you the breakdown of our reservation distribution this year: 55% CHAINWEBSITE.com, 27% CHAIN Call Center, 9% GDS Travel Agencies, 9% Third Party Websites (broken down into Orbitz, Expedia and Travelocity). In short, due to our policies we CANNOT offer a lower price outside of our best available rate available on the CHAINWEBSITE.com - we could null our franchise agreement.<p>I only speak for one chains policies, but this chain has 6k properties and another 1k or so in development. It's not small.<p>Thats one thing to think about. Some more thoughts:<p>Getting GMs to lower rates is tough; if you give guest X rate Y, and guest Z finds out, they also want rate Y. It sometimes makes a messy situation dealing with this. Selling rooms in important, but keep rate integrity intact is also important.<p>Chicken/Egg conundrum. How do you plan on getting hotels to participate?<p>-- In response to the above, I would personally like to search my geographical area for any travelers without having to sign the hotel up. Can I do that? Why not?<p>Some solutions to the above thoughts:<p>Instead of getting hotels to directly negotiate prices, why not use a combination of that and a GDS system like Amadeus, SABRE or Galileo. You know, so if a hotel doesn't bid on their trip to offer occupancy, then they have the option of making a booking through your system opposed defaulting to Expedia (which books through the same systems). It might solve the intermittency between the chicken/egg problem, and having an active user base - attracting one before the other would be essential. Overall, I don't think the hotel industry will take kindly to having to bid for guests. On the other hand, there is LOTS of money to be had and I wish you the very best.

That means they're pulling copyrighted content in < 3 hours, which is pretty damn good.<p>Simultaneously, you can find lots of UGC that isn't pirated on justin.tv (i.e., the site exists for more than piracy).",1259444847
965555,comment,964727,964727,0,0,btilly,,,"And this is why people who don't know science should ask questions first.<p><i>The tree ring data, after a certain point in history, is no longer a reliable indicator of local temperature changes. There is no explanation for why trees no longer reflect local temperature changes. We know that they no longer reflect local temperatures, presumably, because we have other more reliable measurements available now (measurements that are not available further back in history).</i><p>There is NO SINGLE EXPLANATION for the discrepancy.  This is NOT the same as there being no explanation.<p>What happens instead is that if you look in specific localities you can find specific explanations.  Increased acidity here.  Drought conditions there.  Insect infestations in another.  And in yet another the correlation with temperatures remains.<p>What happened is that after 1960 due to large scale changes in environment in many localities the correlation broke down, so the overall correlation broke down.  But there is no single explanation because in different areas the specific reasons differ.<p><i>This leaves us with a conundrum: is there any period in which alternative measurements and tree-ring measurements correspond with one another? Is the divergence between our measurements and the tree-rings something we can trace? Is it sudden or gradual? If there is no period in which there is a correspondence between our measurements and the tree-rings, what does this say about our assumption that tree-rings have ever accurately captured local temperatures?</i><p>Actually there is about a century of comparative data before that which shows a good correlation.  That is why we are willing to project temperatures back farther using that record.<p>Now there is the possibility that there were previous periods which saw a similar breaking of the correlation.  This question is a question of scientific debate.<p><i>It seems that the implication is that changes in the environment have rendered tree-rings unreliable. But if we're arguing that tree-rings are unreliable because of environmental change (i.e. the chemical changes to the composition of the atmosphere and water cycle that contribute to global warming), and we're seeking to explain environmental change, we're begging the question (assuming the explanandum in the premise of our argument).</i><p>There is no begging the question when we are also studying the mechanisms involved.<p><i>Until a causal mechanism for the divergence between tree-rings and other measured temperatures can be specified, how can they legitimately be discarded as evidence, without invoking tautological reasoning?</i><p>You are making two large assumptions here.  The first is that there is a single causal mechanism.  The second is the assumption that we don't actually understand the mechanisms involved.  Both assumptions are wrong.<p>Look.  Scientists aren't exactly stupid people.  When they spend a lifetime studying something, you should assume that they've asked the obvious questions and try to find out the answers they have found rather than assuming that they are stupid and you're the first to notice the glaring issues.<p>Unfortunately climate scientists are also humans who are under constant assault from people who can't and won't be bothered to actually learn the record.  People who feel they are under constant assault engage in defensive behavior.  And people who are being defensive tend to circle the wagons and have difficulty in remaining open with outside groups.<p>When you encounter such defensive behavior I strongly recommend trying to understand what the defensive person's position is rather than immediately piling on and validating their defensiveness.  If they are wrong, this approach leaves you in a better position to figure that out.  But if they have a point, you'll be more likely to figure that out as well.",1259444846

But when we talked with initial customers, there were certain things they wanted more that, when built, made encryption a slower, more difficult process to implement.  We punted on encryption because, for the first 3 months we were in the market, there was a little demand, but not much.  Then as we hit more mainstream blogs and publications and got a wider user base, encryption shot to the top of our list.  So what we learned is that our first 500 customers weren't very representative of who would ultimately use the product and we shouldn't have catered to them so much.  We really should have paid less attention to early customers, and more attention to related markets like PC backup, and assumed they had already figured out what the market wanted.",1259444763

If raising a child left only two hours a day to work, that's still 10 hours during the week -- as much time as DHH spent coding basecamp and rails his first year. If you add to that time you can spend planning, communicating, and thinking about the problem (to fill the time when you're more likely to be interrupted) you can optimize those few hours even further.<p>So far as I can tell, this is the pattern my mother used while she was caring for me and working her way through journalism school. I had colic. But she'd do her interviews in the intervening time, and she'd collect all the information she needed, and wrote fragments she wanted to include. When she got the chance, she sat down and wrote the whole article in a single sitting.<p>PS: Thanks for being part of this community. I started to read your comment page, and you've contributed many wonderful insights I've had to copy to remember for later :-)",1259442506

We never thought ourselves capable of designing a competition where the winner was in any way assured of “making it”- the free market is the only force capable of determining that. But that wasn’t the point; the post is correct that the perceived ancillary benefits of forming a strong team, making deadlines, and meeting/facing potential customers and investors turn out to be what make the whole thing worth it (and not necessarily for the success of the business being pitched but for the skills built by the students).  As pg implies, the judging is not ""for real"" since it's with OPM, but compare that to the usual indicators given at universities (grades) and it doesn't look so bad.<p>The vast majority of the teams realize this too, and the ones who don’t are not the ones who go far. Winning the grand prize is basically a bonus for the the team who gets it...<p>Is a b.p. competition for everyone? Probably not.  I’d definitely prefer being a part of YC before winning the 100k (dreaming up a web app); YC community >> 80k.  But they are not mutually exclusive and the b.p. application is only 2 pages and 10 slides.<p>And a big success who actually won such a competition? How about EnerNOC, a $600M public co that won the Dartmouth competition in 2002.  They do load balancing for electric utilities (big customers go low-power during peak demand).  Probably doing more good for the world then all the apps in the app store.",1259442230

It's absolutely true that Apple products aren't composed of anything special.  It's the particulars of how these things are put together and made to work together that holds the most <i>value</i>.<p>People who are still going over component lists, and insisting that Apple is just a ripoff because you can get the same ingredient list for less elsewhere just don't get the key idea.  As our technology for producing <i>stuff</i> advances, even complex components are commoditized.  So it's how everything fits together and <i>works</i> which will be the hard part with the big payoff.<p>American car manufacturers had to be schooled by Japanese companies in the last century.  Apple is currently schooling Microsoft, and Microsoft is slowly learning.  Apple doesn't quite get this when the scope of ""how the system works"" extends out to include he dynamics of developer communities.  What they have with the iPhone and the developer community works better than what's come before, but it can certainly be beat.",1259442187

Every step along the way is rigged: the schools that grant medical licenses is artificially gated, you require certifications you need political clout to obtain to open a medical facility, you need to have enough money to play ball with insurers so you get paid for operations, you need to comply with thousands of federal regulations surrounding your procedures, you need to get zoning permission from wherever you are trying to set up shop to even build a medical facility (note that local governments are easily bought out by the hospital chain in their area).<p>There is also an incredible amount of corruption surrounding drug prescription and diagnosis to get people buying way more drugs than they need to.<p>It isn&#x27;t anything close to a free market. I could never open a health clinic out of my garage and put out a sign saying free anything related to medicine. By comparison, India has much more volatile healthcare (because they can&#x27;t police everyone trying to play doctor) but get innovation as a result.",1375084767

People vote for money and liquor. But people vote. They throw parties out of power when they want to. A benevolent, even if he promises to turn India back  into a golden bird, will not want you to vote.<p>Democracy is often a mess, but is better than the rightless life under a benevolent. \nIndia is in a mess, lets not make it any worse. There are alternatives if you look close. You can educate people, unite instead of divide people. You can contest elections or vote for the voices of sanity. There will be difficulties and we will always be a work in progress, but we will have to try.  Democracy is not a panacea, you still have to work to make it better. Giving away all of your rights and responsibilities, hoping some benevolent oppressor will save you is not the way to do it.<p>Many of my friends have been saying the same thing. Indian messageboards are overflowing with hate. A certain benevolent has been identified as well. One who has proven his credentials. The chanted name has divided a state successfully, and I fear permenantly, across religious lines. The bet is to do the same thing across the country. If you don&#x27;t feel the poisonous atmosphere, it is because you are wilfully ignoring the obvious and concentrating on the made up.<p>How long should we continue living as people of a certain religion or caste? How long should we continue hating people who are of a certain religion or caste, knowing that the other person had as little a choice in selecting their religion/caste as we had in selecting ours?<p>Xenophobia has never been India&#x27;s big problem, but we know it simmers in most households, in one form or the other. We take pride in what our ancestors did and forsake everything to maintain that pride. We close our eyes trying to fit in, not believing that this life may be the only life we get. That there may be no rebirth or afterlife. That love is its own reward and hate its own punishment.",1375084642

Well, that works great as long as everyone shares your ethical views.  Unfortunately, not everyone does, and there are people in this world who would happily kill you and take all your property if they could.  It doesn&#x27;t even have to be all that many people - if just 0.1% of the population believes &quot;might makes right&quot; and you come in contact with >1000 people, you&#x27;re probably dead.<p>The reason we have the state is so that we can realize certain economies of scale in protection.  We entrust a monopoly on the use of physical force to the state; in return (in lawful democratic regimes), it agrees to use that force only when just.  That way we can trust that we can go about our business without being randomly killed by a dude on the street, because they know that <i>they</i> are in for a world of hurt if they kill someone.  There have been times (eg. the Wild Wild West in America, or post-Gorbachev looting & unrest in the Soviet Union) where the state has <i>not</i> had that monopoly on force, and it usually ends up being very difficult to conduct business during those times.",1375084636

What is the ideal value function here? If you have a notion of one, it&#x27;d be easier to understand your point of view if you were to explain that clearly first before giving us the end result of your logical conclusions.

You for sure want to change your path if you find yourself in a mosquito-ridden swamp.<p>But if this was the only problem, I would have simply switched to another lab. Thats what I thought until not too long ago (even if the idea of quitting was really in my mind since a lot of time). But the problem is the practice of science itself.<p>Dont get me wrong. Every scientist goes on to do science for a single reason: the love of science. Science doesnt make you rich, it doesnt make you famous (can you tell me the last 5 Nobel Prizes for chemistry without looking on Wikipedia? I cant either) and doesnt make you comfortable. The only sane reason for starting to do science is the dispassionate love of science itself. And I loved science. Like nothing else. Since I was 5 years old. And I still love it.<p>But one thing is to love science; a completely different one is doing it. Like the proverbial sausage, you dont want to know how its done.<p>Actually, doing science per se is great. Doing experiments, analyzing data, making calculations, programming code: I loved it all immensely.\nHowever, with the partial exception of mathematics and theoretical physics, you cant be a lone wolf in science. You need funding, you need instruments, you need resources. You need other people. And heres where the problems lie. You basically face two choices.<p>---<p>[ Diagram explaining the &quot;Profzi&quot; scheme, a cynical depiction of the academic bureaucracy: <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd030909s.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd030909s.gif</a> , original at <a href=""http://blog.devicerandom.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/phd030909s.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.devicerandom.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/phd0...</a> ]<p>[ Diagram quote: No, it&#x27;s not a satire or an exaggeration. ]<p>---<p>The first is going for the sky: doing great science in a first-class place, make a great curriculum and look for a tenured position in the end. The problem is that a lot of clever people want to go for the sky, and there is much more people who want the sky compared to the available positions. In general, science career is a race, where three people go to the podium and all the others sooner or later will go back home (See also this article from the Economist on the problem). The competition for funding and positions means that not only the hopes of getting a job are really lousy, but that people become nasty. Like, really nasty.<p>I know of people that have given a purportedly crippled software to a collegue to sabotage his project. Ive been violently attacked verbally for having dared talking with my supervisor of a project I was collaborating with, because she feared that I wanted to steal her credit. Ive seen more than once people helped  during a project, only to find all credit for their work taken by the nice and smiling people who scammed them by helping them. There are endless horror stories like that. Everywhere. Now, do you want to work in a place full of insanely clever people who are also insanely cynical and determined to do everything to get on top of you? If so, you can do top level science.<p>Its not all, of course. Top level science requires also an absolutely mind-boggling determination and, overall, confidence in yourself. To properly do science you must be absolutely sure that, whatever you have in mind, you will do it, no matter what, and that youre doing it right, to the point of almost self-delusion. This is so important that who wins in science is regularly not the most brilliant but the most determined (Ive seen Nobel prizes speaking and half of the times they didnt look much more brilliant than your average professor. Most of them were just lucky, and overall were incredibly, monolithically determined). Combined with the above, this means working 24/7, basically leaving behind everything in your life, without any doubt on your skills and abilities and most importantly on your project, while fencing off a competition of equally tough, confident and skilled guys.<p>---<p>[ Diagram of an evil-looking clown: <a href=""http://www.gamesprays.com/images/icons/i-like-you-so-ill-kill-you-last-3401_preview.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamesprays.com/images/icons/i-like-you-so-ill-kil...</a> , original at <a href=""http://blog.devicerandom.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/lget0003+i-like-you-ill-kill-you-last-killer-clown-poster-card.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.devicerandom.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/lget...</a> ]<p>[ Diagram quote: A friendly post-doctoral scientist in your group asking for a scientific collaboration. ]<p>---<p>The ones Ive seen thriving in Cambridge, apart from geniuses (there are a few), are the guys who cling to a simple ecological tenet: Find your niche, where you are indispensable, and keep it in your claws at all costs. This means basically that these people do always the same thing, over and over again, simply because its the lowest-risk option. I could have done the same (I was pretty skilled during my Ph.D. in a quite obscure but interesting biophysics experimental technique) but I thought that doing science properly was also about learning and broadening your expertise. How wrong I was.<p>You can imagine yourself what does it mean also for research in general: Nobody takes risks anymore. Nobody young jumps and tries totally new things, because its almost surely a noble way to suicide your career.<p>There is a second option, which is bare survival. You go from postdoc to postdoc, perhaps end up as a long-term researcher somewhere in some tiny university or irrelevant research center and basically spend your time with a low pay, working on boring projects, crippled by lack of funding and without any hope of a reasonable career (because the career path is taken over by the hawks above described), nor any hope of stability in your life.<p>Notice that, again, both paths do not offer you any guarantee of sort. You can arrive to tenure track (itself an achievement) and being kicked out after a few years, thus ending up as a jobless 40-year something, with a family probably, too old to compete in the market of real jobs. And bare survival is not easy as well.<p>---<p>So basically, if you are not cut for this kind of life, your chances are zero. I tried, believe me. I tried hard. What happened during my research career is that I spent 6 months on antidepressants, I got a permanent gastritis, I wasted at least two important sentimental relationships, and I found all my interests and social life going down the drain.<p>All of this for having a couple papers about modeling obscure aspects of protein behaviour, papers that will be probably lost within the literally thousands of papers that come out every day? Until not so long, I thought that it was worth it. It was something that I had never questioned so far. I wanted to be a scientist since when I was five. I had done everything to become a scientist. I was a scientist in one of the top universities of the world, in one of the top five research groups on the subject. I had won a personal fellowship to fund myself. Most of my self-esteem, of my very concept of self-realization, relied on myself being a scientist. The very idea of quitting academia was a synonim of personal failure.<p>---<p>It has been long and painful to discover that it was just an illusion. When I found that academia was not working for me, I got immediately depressed -my whole worldview was crumbling. Then I remembered that I had a life. I liked my life. I had a billion things that I loved to do. I want to do them again. Quitting and reclaiming back your life is not failing. It is waking up and winning.<p>A week ago I was with friends, talking about my job, and I found myself comparing science to a drug addiction. Being a scientist, from the brain chemicals point of view, is one week of adrenaline rush when youre finally on to something and pieces go together -followed by six months (if you are lucky) of pain and suffering, only to get again that adrenaline shot.<p>Well, noble addiction as it is, it is toxic the same. The next month Ill be 30. Its really time to get my life back.<p>--------------------------------------",1375081414

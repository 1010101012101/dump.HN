With widely dispersed settlements, these people developed a tradition of long-distance running up to 120 miles (190 km) in one session, over a period of two days through their homeland of rough canyon country, for intervillage communication and transportation as well as to hunt.</i><p>They also have the tendency to eat when hungry, sleep when sleepy (as in, anytime / anywhere) which has threads to other ""genius"" discussions (lets call being able to run 100's of miles a type of ""physical genius"" for a thought experiment). I know when I do barefoot walking on a frequent basis my chronic lower back pain starts to dissipate.<p>Side note:\nWe also aren't naturally meant to sit all day in an office chair, yet...",1326664788

Public schools are often made up of those living in the same area, which often means similar social economic status rather than a melting pot.  I didn't have anything but fellow whites in my classes in public school till third grade, when we had one student who wasn't white, and in 5th grade, there was a second (though I still only had one in my class that year).  This wasn't your experience?  Then guess what - so much for the shared experience, no matter that we both went to a traditional school.<p>Having had chicken pox is an experience most of the population also shares.  Now I contracted the virus as a baby when my brother brought it home from kindergarten.  Can't say as I remember it at all as I was barely out of the womb, but I apparently got so few pox marks that I got shingles as a 20-year-old college senior, and oh what fun that was.  Has our son had Chicken Pox?  No, as we opted to get him the vaccine.  I hope he doesn't feel we wronged him by depriving him of a typical childhood experience.<p>When our son was 5 and homeschooled, he was playing in the ocean while his traditionally educated cousins were in school.  My brother asked me, ""When are you going to let him out into the real world?""<p>My response was something like this:<p>""If you think your children are in the real world because they are in a traditional school, I think you are deluding yourself.  Do you have to ask permission to urinate?  No, and neither do most people in the real world, but your children do.  Ditto getting a drink of water.  Are your children starving?  No?  Well, that is the real world for many children (as of 2010, the the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization puts the figure at over 13% of the world population is undernourished, but I didn't have an iPhone to look this up on the beach back in 1996).  Have your children been sexually molested?  Perhaps you'd like to set them up for that experience as it's one many have had.""<p>I gave some other examples of what ""the real world"" is for other people in the world and ended with:<p>""I believe we can make our own worlds to a good degree, and feel it irresponsible not to realize that and choose what world you'd like for yourself and your loved ones and to work toward living in that world.""",1326663486

There many other little things.<p>I think (and strongly hope) that this is just a transient period. Looks like Apple would like to get rid of classical file system ""feel"" on the user's side. They either have no human friendly solution yet (measured on Apple standards) or want to do it step-by-step, so users can accommodate to changes gradually.<p>iCloud is application/document type based storage, iPad is application based file storage. They even added a view to finder: ""All My Files"", which also hides classical file system way of browsing files.<p>I do not think that Apple is done with file management evolution. But I feel, that the classical hierarchical file system structure is not the way to go in the cloud based file system...Consider not only your document syncing, but also synchronized file sharing with custom categorization...",1326663168

Wikipedia gives the following definition:<p>""Unschooling is a range of educational philosophies and practices centered on allowing children to learn through their natural life experiences, including play, game play, household responsibilities, work experience, and social interaction, rather than through a more traditional school curriculum.""<p>I consider our son to have been homeschooled for K-4th grade as we were using a private school's curriculum at home and he was having tests graded by a teacher hired by the private school and paid by us.  He went on field trips and did a bunch of other things (played with Legos, studied electricity and geography, etc.) with other homeschoolers and played with both homeschooled and traditionally schooled children.  One day when he was 6 and in 4th grade, he was reading a college engineering book (friends of the family had given him when he was five, why I am not sure) when I came to him and said it was ""time for school"" and to come to the kitchen (where we typically ""did school"").  He looked up at me and responded, ""Why should I stop doing what I am doing here, which is actually helping me to learn something new, to go in the kitchen a fill out a bunch of worksheets on things I've long since known?""  Foolishly, I answered, ""Because we paid good money for this program.  But if you want to go it on your own once you finish the fourth grade curriculum, we can give that a try.""  I should have just ended homeschooling with a private school curriculum right then and there, but I am not as quick a learner as our son.<p>Anyway, after 4th grade, he learned using all sorts of activities and books, and unschooling was the most delightful part of my career as a homeschool teacher/parent (as really my son was more the teacher than I; he had started correcting my spelling and offering me more precise words for my business letters when he was only two).  He went to Shakespearean plays since he was three or four, I think (we had a very smart entrepreneurial friend who owned a tech company by day and ran a Shakespearean group by night and weekend, and he still doing both today).  And while I admit I feel history was his worst subject, he was still far better at it than most American adults, as supported by his score on the Culturescope test (where he scored higher at age 7 than most high school seniors) and his being a top student at age 11 and 12 in his university's Honors College upper level history and culture courses.<p>I don't see unschooling as meaning the parents can't provide any direction to the child's education, or use any textbooks, though I also don't think textbooks are necessary for learning in general (the only exception perhaps - and this is only a perhaps - being upper level math).",1326662557

3468264,comment,3467782,3467782,12,0,naner,,,"How she envisions stenography would be used for programming:<p><a href=""http://stenoknight.com/WritingCoding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stenoknight.com/WritingCoding.html</a><p><i>Programming is especially suited for steno, because there's so much boilerplate to write again and again, even in an eloquent language like Python. If I want to define a function, I have to type:</i><p><i>def someFunction(arg): stuff.</i><p><i>That's eight strokes just to get started, plus 20 more strokes to write ""someFunction"", ""arg"", and ""stuff"". In steno, on the other hand, you could write something like D</i>FD in a single stroke, and it would put in the def, the space, the parentheses, the colon and the carriage return automatically, then jump you up to the space after the def to write your function name and arguments, then then drop you back down to the body of the function, all in four strokes. Best of all, once you defined that function name in your steno dictionary, you wouldn't need to worry about remembering to write out the name in camel case each time. Just use a single stroke like SPHU<i>PBGS (pronounced ""smunction""), for instance, and start thinking of it as just another word, instead of two words mashed together in a lexically unnatural way.</i><p><i>I love the way Vim has mapped a useful command to each key of the qwerty keyboard. It's immensely powerful once you get used to it. But it's only got 26 keys to choose from, and it takes a long time to learn which key does what, since the correlation between ""move one word forward"" and the ""w"" key is pretty abstract and arbitrary. In steno, you could certainly keep using just the w key, if it's what you're used to, but you could also, say, map the ""move one word forward"" command to a single stroke like ""WOFRD"" (pronounced ""woffered""). That's mnemonically much more useful than just ""w"", and an even bigger advantage is that the number of possible one-stroke commands is almost infinite. Instead of one stroke equalling one letter, steno lets one stroke equal one syllable, which is about five times more efficient quantitatively. As a qualitative improvement, the advantage is inestimable.</i>",1326661947

If some judge wanted to, he could probably use SOPA to take down just about any website with user-generated content.  a good law isn't one that's broad and over-reaching and you just hope that it's implemented fairly.  a good law is one that is specific, targeted, and difficult to abuse.<p>4. the point that i'm disappointed that nobody made: the pirate bay is a .org (and nominally a .com), which technically makes it a US site.  the NBC guy's prime example of why we need SOPA is immune to SOPA.",1326661449

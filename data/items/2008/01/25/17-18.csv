104231,comment,104022,104022,0,0,mdkersey,,,"Most research into brain function and AI employs  models that are at the lowest level atomic (i.e., basic chemistry). In ignoring quantum mechanical effects, we are like physicists who approximate a function with a Taylor's series and then truncate the series' higher-order terms. They shouldn't be significant but there's that nagging thought that sometimes they are.<p>In the book ""Tending Adam's Garden : Evolving the Cognitive Immune Self"" Irun Cohen discusses (among other things) how evolutionary processes may set up shop in any available ecological niche, regardless of how inefficient or convoluted the process may be. More nagging thoughts.<p>Degrees of freedom involving quantum mechanical operations are available; there's no reason they wouldn't be used. And as others have stated here, evidence is accumulating that they are used in biological systems. Hard evidence that the brain uses such processes would be revolutionary.<p>Many models of atomic and electromagnetic theory lie strewn by the roadside as science moves forward: "">Maxwell's molecular-vortex model of electromagnetism ( <a href=""http://victorian.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/victorianweb/science/maxwell1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://victorian.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/victorianweb/science/ma...</a> ) and William Thomson's (Lord Kelvin) vortex model of the atom  come to mind.

Java did not scale out as a general purpose programming language - it remained foreign and inadequate on all major platforms and, as a result, no software (in comparison to C family) has been done in it, with a notable exception of zoo-like server environments. Go into Debian packages repository and see for yourself. Or, for Windows users, into your C:\Program Files folder.<p>I hope nobody will be stupid enough to start listing (one by one, literally) Java software projects, like Eclipse, Lucene, etc.",1201282714

I don't know why you would need -C, though it saves five keystrokes (""cd -"") if you didn't want to end up in the target directory for some reason.<p>Listing 6 looks like a bad idea; it either goes to or makes a directory, depending on whether it existed.  I realize he's just illustrating the use of ""||"", but don't copy the command.  Usually you would want pwd to be an invariant.  It looks like he really wanted to write:<p><pre><code>  [ -d tmp/a/b/c ] || mkdir -p tmp/a/b/c\n</code></pre>\nGNU mkdir -p will not complain if the target directory already existed, so you could just run<p><pre><code>  mkdir -p tmp/a/b/c\n</code></pre>\nbut then that doesn't illustrate the use of ""||"".<p>Overuse of 'cat' is a hard habit to break for some reason, especially since it's so harmless.  I found it useful as an intermediate step that Z shell is more flexible than other shells about where to put redirection, so:<p><pre><code>  < foo.txt | wc -l\n</code></pre>\nworks in zsh instead of cat foo.txt (to get line count without a filename, which is useful in shell scripts and long one-liners), and seeing that, I would see more obviously that the pipeline is unnecessary.",1201281273

We're wanting to create a crawler to visit some sites that have forms, lists of items and detail of items. They're all in the real estate market and we want to capture the properties and pull out the latest ones. I'm being told that we need to create a specific crawler for each site, but I was wondering if we could create a generic crawler that has some kind of plug-in or pattern matching file (that we build manually) for each site. Anyone who is super-skilled in this area - I'd appreciate some advice.  We're using Python also.  One caveat - I'm not the tech guy as I tried to program and failed, but I do understand what we need and have a very good understanding of technology, I'm just inept at taking my ideas and doing anything with them :)",1201280428

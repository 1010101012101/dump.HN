But the <i>ONE</i> windows box we have here has the same problem. So I could make the exact opposite case (""windows crashes, X does not, windows should learn from 'X'"") and it would still just be anecdotal evidence.<p>The author suggests that windows has 'the solution' for these kinds of crashes, that is why saying but windows does it too is relevant, it somewhat negates his assertion.<p>If windows would really be rock solid I think I would have a different experience, and - sadly - I'm not alone in that.<p>What the underlying reasons are is anybodies guess, but by bitching about it it is not going to get solved.<p>His parting shot is:<p>""I'm sure the blame-game will be played thoroughly in the comments, but it will only detract from the real problem here. The Linux desktop needs a modern, robust, and advanced graphics stack, which makes sure that crashes and bugs remain isolated, without them affecting the users' work.

Contrary to the idea that two parents are better than one, <i>I</i> thought life was better when it was just mom and me.  My grandmother was around a while.  She watched over me during the summers sometimes and lived with us a while, but she wasn't reliable, so mom paid for baby sitting a couple years.  The rest of the time I was latch key.<p>She also finished her degree while I was growing up. She'd take me to the college library with her. I was always frustrated by the lack of books for kids my age, but somehow I endured.<p>From the time I was 5, she had a good job with the government, so life was pretty stable.  Except for the name calling, I only felt the effects of not having more money once.  We were on the way back from her university and we stopped at a convenience store and I asked for a sandwich.  She said we couldn't afford it.  They were a special sandwich I really loved and not being able to afford it, I thought they must have cost $20 or something.  Years later, when I was in high school I stopped and got one of those sandwiches for $2 and it hit me all of a sudden that we didn't have a lot of money.<p>Except for that, I always felt like I had all I wanted.  Looking back, had we had more money, I probably would have had a computer growing up.  Maybe I'd be better at programming, or maybe I'd have gotten bored with it.  Who knows.  I lived pretty rural, so our house was more than big enough.  I worked during the summers as quickly as I could, so I had my spending money.<p>I think it actually helped me to be honest. Not having a lot as a kid and finding happiness anyway has helped me live frugally as an adult as well.

You could give the plane 50 knots leeway in speed and still fly over most of the weather out there.<p>For conditions like the ones that the Air France flight was going through, this would seem prudent.  You can't fly above thunderheads like that.  Might as well get yourself into a safer part of the flight envelope in case something bad happens.",1244509177

648324,comment,648277,648277,0,0,jrockway,,,"I disagree.  The roots of programming and writing are the same -- creativity constrained by rules.  In programming, your creativity is bounded by what the computer will accept as valid input.  In writing, the rules are procedures like grammar, spelling, and style.<p>A good writer knows that effective communication requires re-iterating the main point.  This may conflict with ""DRY"", but it doesn't conflict with following the rules.<p>Anyway, there are many excellent programmers that are poor writers.  This is probably not some sort of intrinsic property of the Universe, but rather due to the programmer's lack of practice in writing.  If you don't do something, you aren't going to be good at it, programmer or not.",1244508968

Then launch your space elevator satellite and lower the cable down to the top of the tower.<p>The cable has to support its own weight, so it has to be thicker at the top than at the bottom.  It turns out that the cable thickness has to taper <i>exponentially</i> (basically, this amounts to a rotation of the catenary problem).<p>So not having to support the last 100 km of cable at the end translates into a weight savings along its entire length.",1244508897

So when I told a client I'd help out with a market research study examining the tech adoption trends for PHP developers, I was sure that the community would cheerfully participate. Especially since anyone who did the 30-minute phone survey would get a $25 Amazon gift certificate AND a summary of the results; that's worth somethin', I figured.<p>I was wrong.<p>Despite posting a ""help on a survey"" message on several forums, people have stayed away in droves.<p>To some degree, I'm sure, it's because I'm looking for people with a specific background: in the US or Canada; regularly using one of {Joomla, SugarCRM, Drupal, WordPress, phpBB} for paying/outside work (not the company's own intranet); willing to talk to a charming geeky person on the phone. But I expected that the number of people meeting that criteria is far higher than the results would imply.<p>I realize that some people don't want to give out their email ID to ANYone, but if you're going to be interviewed by phone, how else can you be reached to say, ""How about Tuesday at 2pm?"" This isn't spam, dammit; it's real live market research asking about the tools and platforms you use and how you choose them.<p>If YOU are not shy, of course, I hope you'll participate in the survey ( http://www.marketsurveys.com/sb/sb_s.php?s=120&p=100121&g=4d4502a838 ).

They may be right; after all, prejudices are usually founded in real-life experiences.<p>The problem comes when you over-generalize those experiences and crystalize that over-generalization as knowledge.<p>A silly example: you run a test on a website about button colors and red is the best color and that it made a large difference.<p>There are a lot of lessons you could possible take from this, e.g.,
1. Users prefer red buttons over any other color
2. You should always test button color
3. It's important to think about what draws users' eyes and test that, including buttons.
4. It's important to test everything, no matter how small<p>Learning (1) is probably wrong.  Red might work in this situation, but not in another.  This is the problem with learning tactics in general.  As the competitive landscape evolves or the situation ""on the ground"" changes specific tactics become less useful, and might even be worse than an alternative you've precluded because of your ""expertise.""<p>(2) and (3) are probably good lessons to take away.  (3) is better because it opens your eyes to new, possibly fruitful things to test, although (2) isn't bad.<p>(4) is the opposite of (1) in that it's an overbroad lesson that is hard to apply and if done religiously would probably paralyze the decision-making process.<p>Anyhow, that's how I think about applying ""data-driven"" processes to business, marketing, and product decisions.",1244508076

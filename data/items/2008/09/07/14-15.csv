I amateur box and getting in the ring with big muscular guys who obvious do bodybuilding style routines is great.  They can't flick out fast punches and they run out of juice inside three rounds.  This is well researched.",1220799499

There are two separate issues here: 1) Logs aren't very useful; 2) Strength training with substantial rest between sets is inferior to intense routines without rest in many ways.<p>My other points lack citations, but they aren't useless opinion.",1220798824

297514,comment,297054,297466,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Logs won't really help keep you from excess training.  You are not a machine; your physiological response to exercise is poorly modelable.  You just have to be in tune with your body.  There are all kinds of homeostatic forces when it comes to exercise that dynamically push back on increased volume.  For example, high volume aerobic exercise can increase your ability to build fat reserves, leading to strongly diminishing returns from running for purposes of the average Joe trying to lose weight.<p>I alluded to this above: your body responds best to randomly varying exercise.  Both frequency and type.  Take a few weeks off.  Then work out three days in a row, a completely different form each day.  Then twice a week, and so on.  Don't work out on a predictable schedule.  It pretty much happens if you listen to your body.  This just isn't amenable to logs, but it has proven benefits to making fitness durable and affecting lean body mass.  You want enough variety in what you're doing that exact volume and weight for a previous given lift isn't clearly relevant anymore.<p>My point is that the data is just really not going to be all that useful.  It's not going to give you any meaningful linear projections.  It's not going to tell you whether your body is stressed at a given time.  If once a month you want to record your 100m time and how many pushups you can do that's one thing, but tracking each workout is almost surely a waste of time.  Just mix it up a lot and go hard when you really feel like it.",1220798099
297513,comment,297297,297297,0,0,startingup,,,"Let me list the ways that Chrome starts to encroach on the OS territory.<p>1. It has a fast Javascript VM, that converts Javascript into native code, cutting through lots of layers.<p>2. Each Javascript app (i.e a tab) runs in its own process, which the browser manages. So effectively Chrome <i>is</i> the OS layer as far as your JS apps is concerned.<p>3. The browser provides a nice control panel for managing those tasks and provides stats about its usage - again tradtionally what you wanted from an OS.<p>4. Chrome is not yet cross-platform, but we can expect it to be cross platform in due course. It is open source with a BSD license, so I am guessing lots of people have already started compiling it to every platform on earth. Expect unofficial distros soon.<p>5. Layering Chrome on top of a very stripped down Linux or BSD kernel, letting Chrome do all the GUI work is possible. Chrome does not need MFC, it is layered directly on top of a lower level graphics library (Win32). The calls Chrome needs could be done on top of BSD fairly easily. In fact, that is how Chrome (or Firefox for that matter) is really cross-platform - they come with their own widget sets (i.e MFC equivalent) rather than relying on the specific platform's widget set. Incidentally, Java does the exact same thing.<p>6. OEMs could come up with a 20-30 MB distribution of Chrome, with everything included (kernel, libraries, JS, Flash etc) and bundle it as a web top.<p>So, yes, Chrome <i>is</i> an alternative to traditional operating systems. The fact that it would include a stripped down BSD kernel doesn't count: from the application perspective Chrome <i>is</i> the OS.<p>Snark is all fine and dandy, but occasionally exercising the brain cells a little bit keeps them in good working order.",1220798031
297512,comment,297297,297297,0,0,maxklein,,,"This is not relevant. The layers are not really built on top of each other in that way. Windows is mostly just a collection of libraries which do important stuff. If you did not have this libraries, you'd have to write the libraries. So this is not a layer you can remove, it's an essential part of the application.<p>Things like the Java VM are a real layer, but things like MFC (which chrome does not use, it uses WTL) do not really slow things down or act as a real layer. They compile down to the same code as if you were to do this by yourself.<p>And anyways, what's the point? We should stop writing web apps?",1220797902

297507,comment,297289,297397,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>The MIT course also has switched to using Python.</i><p>I've always assumed that was because of the Feynman effect [1]: The freshmen (of <i>all</i> engineering majors) who were the ostensible audience of SICP were getting more and more frustrated by Scheme, a language that feels impractical to the average know-it-all first-year  mechanical engineer.<p>In my experience, if you name-drop SICP in front of the <i>average</i> MIT student, there's a good chance that they will cringe and mutter some rude word about Scheme. Not <i>everyone</i> is born to love computer science.<p>But if you want to self-study math and CS then you should seek out SICP in Scheme, just as (given the choice and the ability) you should reed Dostoyevsky in Russian instead of in English translation. Use the language the authors really want to use.<p>[1] Which I name, of course, after the <i>Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>, a series of legendary lectures that is beloved by physics grad students but is rumored to have been a failure as an actual first-year physics text. Though accounts differ, the legend is that the lectures were just a bad fit for the average Caltech freshman -- for one thing, Feynman puts relatively little emphasis on solving math problems, which he did as easily as breathing but which the average freshman needs lots of practice in -- and the course was only taught once. Does anybody know of another first-year course that tried to use these as texts? I've never encountered one. But they have certainly been used for self-study by many people, including bright high-school students.",1220797239

However, our patience, lives and our universe too is finite, so it could set practical limits to our task. Say: decoding X signal would only take me more time than the universe to end, so, that's anyway an impossible task. But we should be able, in principle and with infinite time, to analyze any computation. (Well, we should first set a meaning for ""analyze"" in this context)",1220796799

Sometimes Yelp says a place is bad, and I love it.  Sometimes it says it's great, and I hate it.  Sometimes we agree, but basically I can't trust it.  People that aren't professional reviewers don't really know how to review a place (""1 star because I don't like cheese, but ordered a cheese pizza.""  People on Amazon do this too -- ""I didn't like jrockway's book because it didn't cover something I wanted it to.""  That is a wish, not a review.)",1220796642

I'm in graduate school right now, and 90% of a modern mathematician's life is spent on keeping up with the progress of others, particularly in the last 50 years. That is true. However, over time, we also filter out the unimportant stuff. While automorphic forms may be an important field today so that we can bring in fresh minds to try to tackle the Langlands Program, once that is solved there won't be as much of an emphasis. I knew ""more"" calculus than Isaac Newton when I was 12 in the sense that I had learned things like Stoke's theorem that he had not even known about, but Newton's knowledge was much more of a mess, as well. The stuff you learn from textbooks is not how researchers originally discovered things. Think of the analogy of starting a fresh startup codebase that looks horrible, but becomes very polished and clean after several refactorings; it may take weeks to introduce a person to the former codebase, but for the latter it may only take a good one-hour tutorial.",1220796224

Work on upgrading humanity, not computers.</i><p>One of Kurzweil's really strong points was to treat ""AI"" as a very loose term. That is, it could for example mean replacing every human neuron with a manmade (e.g., silicon) counterpart. This has already been done on a small scale in rats (I can't find the reference, but it's in his book).<p>""Upgrading humanity"" IS artificial intelligence if you take artificial to be functionally equivalent to manmade: man has ""upgraded"" himself, and hence created something artificially intelligent.",1220796071

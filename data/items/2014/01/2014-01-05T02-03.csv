Signed elasticity should increase (minimum wage increases become more beneficial) when labor is overabundant. In this case, labor tends to be sold nearer to the minimum price laborers will sell at and further from the price at which employers will stop purchasing so that a minimum wage increase results in more &quot;win&quot; scenarios (wages are increased without being pushed over the &quot;cliff&quot; that results in negative productivity) than &quot;loss&quot; scenarios (where wages <i>are</i> pushed over the cliff). This is consistent with the narrative of American employees losing leverage over time.<p>If both the narrative and its theoretical+observed impact on elasticity are true, minimum wage increases are becoming more beneficial over time.",1388890496

I admit I did not read the entire paper, but it seems Mike Konczal and a lot of us are using &quot;causality&quot; and &quot;correlation&quot; interchangeably, which doesn&#x27;t seem appropriate. This is not an empirical science... lengthy extrapolations don&#x27;t tend to hold their ground in real-world economics. There are so many other factors and variables working that it seems silly to make these extrapolations.

The difference is probably due to the fact that I just counted raw bytes rather than accounting for whitespace and such. My guess, then, is that /* */ without a space hits a bug in the size tool where it probably counts that as the beginning of a comment but misses the end, causing it to count the entire remainder of the program as a comment. The compiler, meanwhile, will see that as an empty comment and continue reading code.<p>This was a fairly predictable consequence of providing an official size tool. Used to be, they just laid out the rules for figuring out sizes, and you had to either count manually, or build your own tool to count. Now, bugs in the size tool end up being bugs in the rules, and fun like this ensues. Whether this is good or bad is a matter of opinion.

It&#x27;s impossible to try to do this gradually via a future import, and it&#x27;s impossible to work out all the potential scenarios where things would behave differently, and particularly the performance characteristics can change and pretty wildly at that, but it sounds like this still, as painful as it would be, sounds like a better approach than P2->P3.<p>Basically, all strings would internally be represented as unicode (OR as a byte array + an encoding, that might be a little too ambitious though), and it has 2 APIs that it can be accessed by. non-instance related operations (such as making new strings) similarly has 2 APIs. pre-unicode-switch code gets an API that emulates as best as is possible the behaviour as before, and post-unicode-switch code gets the full unicode API as exists now for unicode strings.<p>Even if encoding is flat out broken, if you put in a stream of chars and store that as <whatever>, and then later you query this thing, the broken usually ends up undoing itself. Yes, this will fail spectacularly once you try to for example concatenate a string with broken encoding to a string with a different encoding, but presumably places that are international proof have switched to unicode strings long ago, and places that aren&#x27;t really aware of the importance of anything that isn&#x27;t in ASCII 32-127 will find all their code to magically &#x27;just work&#x27;.<p>Similar things should be possible for the iterator business. Internally things are iterators, but if ever any P2 code touches them, they turn into a (memory hogging, etc) list. yes, of course, this will flat out break if you attempt to pass an infinite iterator to code that isn&#x27;t used to it, but these are all transitional pains, and the key point is: As long as you don&#x27;t fork the pre-big-switch version (beyond security updates), sooner rather than later libraries will fix the bugs, or their community of users will just die out as someone else writes a new one to fill the void.<p>Painful? yes. very. We&#x27;ve seen this in programming land before. Java5 introduced generics and as a result any interaction with pretty much any library written before it resulted in a cavalcade of unsafe/raw warnings. It sucked. Huge communities stuck to 1.4 (IBM WebSphere notably stayed there for almost half a decade before moving on to 1.5).<p>But, today? Libraries have upgraded or have been replaced. The chance you still run into pre-generics code is tiny. It took long, it sucked, yadayada, but for all intents and purposes that was java&#x27;s Python2->Python3, and everyone is on Python3 at this point. In the same time span as P2->P3, roughly speaking, and that seems like it&#x27;s nowhere near complete.",1388888855

It&#x27;s worth noting however that the PKI associated with SSL (X.509) is an OSI thing and so understanding OSI concepts is still rather important.  This is also why X.509 certificates IMO feel a bit foreign in terms of structure and they tie in closely to LDAP concepts (a stripped down version of OSI X.500) rather than more internet-y directory concepts like DNS where everything is a text string and human readable.<p>> <i>Hell they don&#x27;t even follow TCP/IP&#x27;s layers, but at least there they make an effort to make it look like they do</i><p>My point was that TCP/IP and OSI are just fundamentally different.  They are culturally different.  They have different goals.  You can understand TCP/IP better on its own than through OSI.  You can&#x27;t understand OSI by using TCP/IP as a sole reference.<p>> &quot;OSI is an ancient, dumb, wrong, 10000000000000 feet architect view of networking.&quot;<p>I think it is more correct to understand OSI in context, namely that it was a network model designed to support the OSI protocol stack.  This stack was intended to fully merge circuit and packet-switched networks (effectively merging phone switches and the internet).  This means you have, effectively, an intelligent network with possibly intelligent terminals, which are capable of doing both circuit- and packet-switched networking on top.  OSI protocols ported to TCP/IP like H.323 make perfect sense if you understand that they are assuming they can open phone calls (but in the process of porting them to TCP/IP, they have to use one TCP/IP connection for each phone circuit they would otherwise open).  This is furthermore why the network perimeter controls designed for H.323 involve what amount to phone switchy things instead of things like firewalls (and why a simple packet filter won&#x27;t work).<p>In terms of the value of not learning it, I think the best approach honestly is to learn TCP/IP without the OSI model first, and then learn the OSI model and what the OSI stack was designed to do after.  This gives you whole layers of insight, not into TCP/IP but into OSI protocols ported to TCP/IP.",1388888404

If these numbers were, say, the generated public exponent in an RSA public key, and the private key was generated just before, you could very easily figure out the factors used to generate the private key. Obviously nobody is using such an obvious &quot;random&quot; number generator.<p>In practice, most DRNG cycles are <i>very</i> large, and it takes many generation cycles for a pattern to emerge. This provides security because even if you get a few randomly generated bits, you won&#x27;t be able to predict which bits were generated next. Even if you know the cycle, it would take many, many bits to be able to know where you are on the cycle and pick what would happen next.<p>Bruce Schneier explains much more authoritatively than I can[1] how Dual_EC_DRBG can be broken--that after collecting only 32 bytes of generated bits, you can predict what the generator will generate next.<p>HOWEVER, what I didn&#x27;t know before re-reading Schneier&#x27;s article, is that in order to predict future numbers from the previous 32 bytes, you need to know the proper constants (unknown) which correspond to the constants set forth in the NIST&#x27;s Dual_EC_DRBG. So only the person generating those constants (in tandem with the unknown constant &quot;key&quot;) can break the standard. So when I said that anyone can break the standard, I was wrong. Color me embarrassed.<p>[1] <a href""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the_strange_sto.htm"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the_strange_s...</a>",1388887593

I get presented with the same article or ad in different searches numerous times to the point I go on to anonymous browsing / ddg.<p>The good thing; when just searched for something about UIView and later type something &quot;populating a table&quot;, it&#x27;ll give me SO articles (and such) about UITableView which is what I meant but forgot to type add ios/or uitable.<p>The bad thing; when i&#x27;m doing research, it&#x27;ll give me the same stuff over and over again and I have to page quite far and add / remove query info / play with search tools to get to different things which might not be the most popular or might not be what Google thinks I want.<p>The awful thing; the ads... I use ad blockers, but when I get ads (gmail / some sites), they are always the same. For Facebook I just think their algorithm is broken or maybe they have none (I only get ads about dating, cheating, stocks all of which I have no interest in nor ever shown), but for Google they show things I am interested in but I already know all of them, have been there, knew most of them before those ads and they cannot possibly sell me anything. If I wanted something from them I would go there without those ads, so why are they targeting me like that? Show me ads I don&#x27;t know and if I can use it, I would click.<p>I&#x27;m technical, but I hear the same annoyance from others; a friend of mine rents out houses; the search results when he wants to research the competition are usually almost only his own sites (presumably because he visits them a lot?) and ads for his own properties. He is very non technical, so explaining this all to him is not really sinking in.",1388887441

It is as if he throws Freud, Jung, and Dante into a pot, seasons with a touch of Hinduism and Arthurian legend and pulls out out a psychological theory which surprisingly makes sense.",1388887415

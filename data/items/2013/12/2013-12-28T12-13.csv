A while ago, I used a project that used an SQLite binding from the Mono project. They decided to discontinue development of this library in favour of a newer alternative, and it was then totally broken by subsequent Mono updates - but it continued to work fine on Windows with .Net. So any projects that still use this library are basically impossible to get working on Linux/Mac because Mono has awful backwards compatibility with the Mono Project&#x27;s own libraries compared with .Net.",1388235527

The same way the &quot;Ask Jeeves&quot; toolbar might pay to be bundled with the Adobe Flash installer.

Back in 2010 AMD changed this program so that they paid manufacturers regardless of whether they wanted to use the stickers (a good move).<p>Edit: Intel also runs an &quot;Intel Inside&quot; sticker program.

It explains equally important factors like the need for natural soaps (surfactants) in the oil as it breaks down, for that perfect color. If you&#x27;ve ever tried to fry something until golden brown in a perfectly clean pot using new oil you&#x27;ve run up against this. The food is still white when it&#x27;s done and cooking it until brown means overcooking it. You have to save a bit of the old oil to mix in with the new stuff.<p>It&#x27;s an easy read with recipes for several dishes and the book can serve as a really solid base for understanding how to be a much better cook.",1388234942

This vastly reduces the number of things you can do with it (yeah, I know about Mono).</i><p>Speaking of Mono, does anyone know of a good resource for C#/.NET devs to learn how to port their Windows apps to Linux/Mac relatively easily?<p>I did a writeup a month ago about my first impressions of Mono:  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6744622\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6744622</a><p>In short, there don&#x27;t seem to be very many &quot;Here&#x27;s how to write cross-platform C# code that runs on all three platforms without much effort&quot; type resources. It seems like most Mono newcomers will find it difficult to get up and running, especially if you&#x27;ve been developing your app with Visual Studio 2010 or later.  So it seems like there aren&#x27;t very many good tutorials written specifically to teach Windows C# devs how to quickly get up to speed with Mono.<p>After spending some time researching the idea of writing GUI apps using C# and Mono, I gave up because it just didn&#x27;t seem straightforward.  Maybe I was going about it the wrong way, but it seemed like Python + Qt bindings would be a more effective approach, even though you lose out Visual Studio&#x27;s awesome GUI designer.  But I haven&#x27;t actually tried python+qt yet on all three platforms, so maybe it isn&#x27;t as easy as it seems.  And my Qt knowledge is somewhat dated, so maybe there&#x27;s a better solution nowadays.<p>Does anyone have any recommendations for the easiest way to write cross-platform GUI apps that can run without an internet connection?  I was thinking maybe making it a webapp, but the offline requirement seems to rule that out.  (Has localstorage progressed to the point where people can start up a browser &quot;app&quot; without an internet connection?  I haven&#x27;t looked into it for awhile.)<p>Plus I&#x27;m not sure how easy it is to write custom webapp GUI objects compared to the fantastic ease of writing custom .NET GUI objects via the VS GUI designer.  Although anything that lets you quickly and easily write powerful GUI apps that run on all three platforms would be pretty fantastic.  What toolset would you use to get the job done?<p>EDIT: Hmm, just thought of another idea...  Would Clojure work well for writing native GUI apps?  It&#x27;s based on the JVM, so it seems like it could leverage existing GUI libraries.  (All the Java GUI libs used to suck, but maybe the situation&#x27;s improved now that Clojure is popular.)",1388234538

6974810,comment,6974194,6974357,3,0,interpol_p,,,"> <i>64-bit ARM is a large step, yes. But, to call it a major breakthrough is laughable. It&#x27;s a natural evolution, the fact that Apple did it first does not make it more significant if Samsung or Qualcomm created their own ARM64 SoC. The iPhone 5s&#x27; camera quality is nothing significant either – the Lumia 1020 has a far better camera and is really true innovation – Zeiss optics, an enormous sensor... how is that less significant than a simple sensor upgrade? I didn&#x27;t see anyone scoffing at the quality of the GS4 either.</i><p>I see Apple&#x27;s A7 as a breakthrough. They went from having nothing to having the best mobile SoC design and implementation in the industry in three years.<p>I really don&#x27;t get your statement about the Lumia 1020. Who is arguing that it is &quot;less significant&quot; than the sensor upgrade in the 5S? Why can&#x27;t people respect both technologies? You come across as incredibly defensive when no one is attacking your favourite product or making any claims like the ones you are defending against.<p>> <i>People will defend this in the name of thinness, but I call bullshit, because the Dell XPS 15 is nearly as thin but contains DIMM slots. It&#x27;s just a ploy to move more units, and I&#x27;m not pleased in the slightest.</i><p>It&#x27;s not a &quot;ploy&quot;. It is very obviously the computer that Apple wants to make. They tend to build for themselves, not for their customers (which seems to make a lot of people angry). I have no idea how you can begin to think this is a ploy to &quot;move more units.&quot; If Apple were into money-making ploys they would have put stickers all over their laptops, bundled them with bloatware and other anti-consumer additions.<p>> <i>In all seriousness, this is now true. When I look at Mavericks&#x27; feature list, it&#x27;s pretty weak. Multiple display support is something that should have been addressed in a point release. Timer Coalescing is something Windows and Linux have had for ages[1], and compressed memory is something we saw years ago.[2] There has been no new replacement for the aging and outdated HFS+ filesystem. There has been no integration for UNIX protocols like X11, and Applescript has been left out to rot.</i><p>So it&#x27;s a problem when Apple adds a software feature that is already present in another operating system? What a weird thing to write. It&#x27;s good that they improved OS X and provided it as a free update. You are trying to spin this as a negative for some reason.<p>There are genuine improvements in Mavericks, the energy usage improvements alone have extended the time I can use my laptop without power by a significant amount. The scroll view content area caching is also very nice in practice, and the new frameworks like SpriteKit have been great fun to play with.<p>On a side note, multiple display support was never an issue under OS X and I fail to understand how Mavericks &quot;fixed&quot; anything in this regard — multiple displays have always worked better under OS X than under Windows.<p>> <i>No Ethernet on a professional machine? I can understand getting rid of it on the ultraportable, but if you want something to be used as a heavy-duty appliance, it needs to have the necessary connectivity options out of box.</i><p>I use my retina MBP professionally every single day and have not once needed ethernet. It is simply not an issue for me, if it is an issue for you then that is why the adapter is available.<p>> <i>iOS 7 is certainly... bold, if you could call it that, but what core improvements does it hold that make it so much better than 6? On the surface, it&#x27;s a pretty UI makeover with an ugly icon makeover, and few user-facing features such as AirDrop and Control Center. Yawn. Shiny new APIs? Nice, but, again, there&#x27;s little in the way of &quot;bold&quot; innovation as Gruber claims.</i><p>Gruber didn&#x27;t claim it was &quot;bold innovation,&quot; he claimed it was a &quot;bold move,&quot; and it&#x27;s hard to argue with that. It was a move that caused a lot of friction and controversy because many people did not like the change. This is a suitably bold move, especially relative to past updates.<p>You simply write a list of some of the changes and then &quot;Yawn&quot; at the end. It&#x27;s easy to be dismissive and to play down the improvements, but the improvements were on par with most other major software releases. The frameworks have always been the best part of iOS updates, and that continues to be the case with iOS 7.<p>> <i>The Apple store left me with a cold, decoherent vibe. Nothing seemed interesting. iOS 7 was underwhelming, and the iPads were just iPads. They didn&#x27;t have anything new. Everything was whitewashed and covered in super-thin Myriad. Shades of grey prevailed throughout, and the staff, while helpful, didn&#x27;t seem to have much interest in the user so much as heralding the merits of the product. Enter the MS store. Everything felt... so new. Inviting.</i><p>It sounds like you&#x27;re simply bored with the Apple aesthetic and want to try something new. That&#x27;s great, you should do that.",1388232340

I think in the long run the industry is moving towards something like credit reports, where you can see yours for free periodically, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re there yet.<p>They might also be moving towards getting rid of these big databases altogether (they get sued a lot for inaccurate results) and relying fully on sending runners to individual courts to get searches, but that doesn&#x27;t scale well enough to cover the entire country every time you do a search on a person. The big databases that pull in records from state, county, muni, DOC, and so on have their problems but it&#x27;s not hard to see why they came into existence: law enforcement and the courts are not properly centralized. My sense is that the industry is in a state of change but I don&#x27;t know anything for sure (except that getting an expungement is one of those things you might as well try since taking the shot doesn&#x27;t cost too much and it might help :) ).",1388232309

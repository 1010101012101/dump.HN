I used a similar service to Mailgun (<a href=""http://postmarkapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://postmarkapp.com</a>) and the amount I paid per month (when I was sending emails) meant if I spent more than 1 hour of my time configuring and managing a mail server every month I would be losing money.<p>This is an especially big issue for people that are using virtual servers or not that great server providers, ones that recycle IPs, if I'm correct in my understanding of mail deliverability, if an IP has sent spam before it's almost guaranteed to be blocked by most spam protection companies, that sort of thing isn't good.",1346165991

India is a dysfunctional state only made functional through continuous petty bribery.<p>Historically police states like Nazi Germany or Mao's China operated by being well organized at all levels of society.  India is absolutely not well organized at all levels of society.  Instead India seems optimized for the petty bribe seeking bureaucrat.  It's not the all knowing police state.  It's the disorganized mafia state.<p>I had an easier time getting a work permit in Russia last year than India.  The sheer amount of paperwork and rubber stamps required for my Indian work permit was the worst I have ever had to deal with and I've worked all over the world.  All of this paperwork and stamping allows perfect opportunities for small time bureaucrats to extract bribes and favors from people who just need to get something done.  So when I look at something like requiring ID to use wifi I don't see Total Information Awareness.  I see Tammany Hall and a genius system that's operating exactly as it was designed, to extract graft from normal people at every possible opportunity.<p>Disclaimer:

4443948,comment,4442710,4442710,2,0,saturdaysaint,,,"I think it's instructive to look away from the world of operating systems, which have been under legal threat since the 80's and thus have always been under an anti-competitive, anti-innovative shadow.  The fact that so few companies tried what Apple did with UI speaks as much to the intimidation inherent in the industry than to Steve Job's genius.<p>Whenever I ask myself if patents are necessary to promote innovation, I think of music software, where copying is a fact of life yet highly original ideas emerge year after year.  Whenever something useful emerges (like Ableton Live's once innovative ""session view"" where you launch repeating music clips) it's usually copied by half the industry within a few versions and nobody even blinks.<p>In the mean time, the biggest incumbents (Avid's Pro Tools, Steinberg's Cubase) have remained seemingly profitable businesses, and consumers have benefited from abundant choice.    The competition has also encouraged the software makers to add a lot of value in the form of lots of included content (soft synths, effects, loops, etc.).  And funny enough, the more innovative companies (Ableton, Propellerhead, Cycling 74 spring to mind) keep coming up with interesting ideas.",1346165810

4443939,comment,4441734,4443675,0,0,fusiongyro,,,"> Conservatism in America is always associated with a decision making process dictated by religion.<p>That seems to be the case today, but I don't think it was always that way. The original idea of conservatism as I understand it is basically to avoid seeing everything as an emergency and to avoid seeing every emergency as the exclusive domain of the state. Conservatism is about moving slowly (conservatively) to avoid making unnecessary changes that turn out to be mistakes. In short, to defuse alarmism with calm, reasoned debate. In fact, today, arguing that we should tear down vast amounts of the government simply because they were erected by liberals is also a dramatic change that an old-fashioned conservative would have some trouble agreeing to.<p>It's pretty sad that both political parties in this country are mostly defined by not being the other one. I would appreciate having a conservative party of this stripe to choose. I think the closest thing we have is the Modern Whig party, which is tellingly considered centrist.<p>Edit: I'm having trouble imagining how the above could merit downvotes without replies.",1346165651

I'm going to resize the originals to the maximum dimensions they can be displayed at on the page and see if that helps.<p>Thank you for being so.. well I don't what to call it but thanks for catching the tiny things.

They had a good FM, a PM which was willing to do the task, however reluctantly, and well ordered subordinates.<p>Other countries have faced easier challenges and failed.<p>And thats only the dismantling of the export license raj. They dismantled the industry side of the raj.

But things like ""slippery slope"" are used to characterize a wide range of arguments of which only a subset are strictly fallacious. And some informal fallacies are only fallacies in the specific context of purported logical proofs, but not necessarily in other kinds of arguments. For example, it's true that an ""appeal to authority"" in an argument means it's not a valid logical argument that proves its conclusions from its premises. But people sometimes raise that objection in contexts where the authority is being invoked as an epistemic authority that raises the likelihood of its conclusion being true (because we have reason to believe that the authority's judgments have non-zero epistemic value), not as part of a logical proof. For example, while it's true that ""the consensus of physicists is that X"" doesn't prove anything about X, if I'm not a physicist and have a background belief that the consensus of physicists is generally a good guide on what is likely to be true about physics, it's a good inference that I should at least provisionally believe X.",1346163128

4443706,comment,4440124,4440371,2,0,mistercow,,,"I really think the ""unprocessed food"" thing is a heuristic that has lost its power. The problem is that it is completely possible to make unprocessed food that is terribly unhealthy. And unfortunately, as with processed food, the cheapest ways to make unprocessed food tastier also make it less healthy. Keep in mind that honey, which many people would consider ""unprocessed"", is very nearly identical to HFCS-55 (and no, there is not good evidence that the slight differences between them significantly impact their health effects).<p>So early on, ""avoid processed food"" was a good way to guess at which foods were likelier to be healthy without having to actually examine them closely. But the heuristic is highly exploitable (i.e. you can trick people into thinking unhealthy food is healthy by making it from ""unprocessed"" ingredients), and in a relatively free market, it was inevitable that it would be exploited.<p>Now, if you advise people to either eat raw, unmodified ingredients, or make their own food out of raw unmodified ingredients, then that will still help them. But I think most people hear ""avoid processed food"" and think ""Oh, I should buy these cookies that are made of whole grains and honey"", and that is not helpful advice anymore.",1346162912

There are several things I was wondering after reading this article:<p>- what are the structural differences between Libya and Norway that would make Libya succumb more easily to the temptation of oil? I suppose Libya is in a direr situation than Norway, but is that all?<p>- exactly, what are the cons of investing <i>some</i> money from the oil in infrastructure of education?",1346162798

4443695,comment,4443354,4443354,11,0,campnic,,,"I really feel like there is an educational opportunity for the HN community about patents. We frequently have these articles where the title of the patent is copy pasted into a submission to generate the largest amount of hysteria possible. Then the HN community completely ignores the fact that a) the titles are misleading and b) the titles are meaningless in terms of patent protection.<p>Based on the claims, they are patenting a system for updating client side web server applications. The system attaches source code information to JavaScript object in order to be able to determine the version of source code that generated the objects. The system attempts to provide a way for web applications to update client side code in a browser using the source code the objects were derived from as a way to continue operation without restart.<p>Now, I'm not saying that is novel. What I'm saying is that there are a lot of presumptions that happen before people even get to the claims. Typically, I encourage people to read the claims first, then work their way back through the rest of the application. Without knowing the claims, there is no way to know what they think is protectable.<p>This isn't a justification of the system. I think (software) patents and the patent system are incredibly broken. Thats not a reason to be unfamiliar with the systems. Know your enemy.

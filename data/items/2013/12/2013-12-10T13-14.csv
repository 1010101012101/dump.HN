6880712,comment,6880605,6880605,1,0,tompko,,,"There are some parts of the engine like move generation and searching that are nicely parallelizable with goroutines. As far as I know Go provides limited support for intrinsics, but you can always use C or assembly to provide access to things like __builtin_ffsll or _BitScanForward64 if you&#x27;re using bitboards. You should be able to avoid any GC based slowdowns by using stack based variables for most functions, so in that respect it shouldn&#x27;t be any slower than the corresponding C code. I&#x27;ve only dabbled in Go myself, but from what I&#x27;ve seen it&#x27;s at least worth a try.",1386683989

For example, I don&#x27;t believe any of the current wave of &quot;tech stars&quot; have achieved what they have through technical skill alone.  It&#x27;s mostly been about business acumen, marketing, timing, assembling a good team, and so on.<p>The &quot;redeeming feature&quot; with software is that programming is actually quite a complex skill, still open to innovation, and the demand for it is  apparently currently higher than the supply. However I believe Obama, and other figures in powerful positions, are attempting to rectify that situation with their &quot;everyone must learn to code&quot; initiatives, and combined with potential innovation in automation and so on, the ground could quite easily shift.<p>So while your open-source contributions may also be contributing to your resume, you have to consider the bigger picture of economics, and human nature, and decide if your current hobby is really viable as a lifetime career, and whether it can trump the &quot;official&quot; route to success or not.<p>What to do?  Charge for your time.  If you&#x27;re any good, someone will pay.  You will learn what programming, in the real world, is all about, and your relatives will see someone practicing &quot;grown up&quot; skills rather than merely indulging a hobby.<p>And finally ... &quot;When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around.

6880694,comment,6880361,6880525,3,0,exDM69,,,"> If you need a lock, then you probably have global mutable state that has to be protected against concurrent updates. The existence of global mutable state indicates a flaw in the application’s design, which you should review and change.<p>There&#x27;s a grain of truth in this one. A lot of people think that multithreaded programming is like single threaded programming with locks added. This is not the case.<p>In my experience, with almost every mutex there should be one or more condition variables that are used to signal various things. A single mutex is almost never enough to achieve anything meaningful, because for every state you mutate, there&#x27;s probably another thread waiting for that state to be mutated.<p>If you&#x27;re working with a language or a framework that has some kind of queues and channels (like Go or Haskell, for example), they are probably more useful for lots of tasks than locks and conditions. Of course, someone has implemented those queues using locks and conditions, or atomic operations.",1386683792

6880684,comment,6880474,6880578,3,0,andrewaylett,,,"No, as I understand that&#x27;s a different change.  The current state of FreeBSD, if I understand correctly, is that it has the option of returning the hardware-generated random sequence directly.  They&#x27;re changing it so it feeds entropy into the pool.  Linux does neither, instead it xors the output of the entropy pool with the output from the hardware random number generator.  This is strictly no less secure than the entropy pool on its own.<p>Note that the implementation of the systems&#x27; entropy pools is also quite different -- my understanding is that FreeBSD uses Yarrow, a pRNG, to feed /dev/random, while Linux mixes bits of &#x27;real&#x27; random data together, without the extra pRNG stage.  Which of these schemes is better is irrelevant to this particular discussion.<p>No links, I&#x27;m afraid, as EE apparently thinks Stack Exchange isn&#x27;t suitable for under 18s and I can&#x27;t turn content lock off at the moment.",1386683713

The question is whether you explicitly use them or if they are hidden somewhere in your libraries, frameworks, etc. Actually, the latter are much more difficult to debug.<p>You say that and then proceed to call the article ridiculous.<p>Well, I write and maintain large applications in Clojure. The code uses a multitude of threads for various purposes, with different lifetimes. And I&#x27;ve yet to see a single explicit lock.

If the devs don&#x27;t cooperate with the modders then its a little harder with C than java.<p>One obvious issue relates to shipping a thousand jar files and a modder simply overwrites one.  You don&#x27;t need gcc&#x27;s linker like you would with C.<p>Another interesting issue is I think the same jar file ships for all OS.  If mojang shipped compiled binaries for each OS, you&#x27;d end up in situations where its hard to reach critical mass for mods.  So maybe industrialcraft would only exist for mac, railcraft for PC, and buildcraft for linux, which would be too bad as they interoperate reasonably well as univeral jar files on all OS.<p>There is an area of architectural interest for a HN startup or whatever.  Its true that GCC was a big deal to install back when I set up SLS linux off 3.5 inch floppy drives in &#x27;93 and the &quot;C&quot; set of SLS floppy disks was a considerable stack of disks and time, perhaps half a box of disks (five or so?).  In 2014 a game installing its own captive copy of GCC (or whatever) would cost only a couple more seconds of download time.  In 1980 &quot;startup time&quot; on an atari 2600 conditioned users to expect 2 to 3 second boot and startup times for a game, but in 2014 we&#x27;ve gradually trained users to expect perhaps 10 to 15 minutes total for OS boot, navigate past console ads, load a game, advertisement/commercials for dev houses, cutscenes, so don&#x27;t tell me that in 2014 users wouldn&#x27;t tolerate running a C linker for 30 seconds as the first step of running a game.  Link while all the advertisements run, or something like that, and no one would even notice.  It would make modding somewhat easier and patches somewhat smaller.  I&#x27;m not talking about inventing the idea of shipping libraries, I&#x27;m talking about compiling them at part of starting the game (or whatever) up.

Many media reports cite studies in health, social, economic, and political trends. Understanding statistical concepts is important to understanding the meaning of these studies and, consequently, to scientific literacy (Crettaz von Roten 2006). One test of these concepts included on the 2008 GSS found that 74% of Americans could read a simple chart correctly and 66% understood the concept of &quot;mean&quot; in statistics. Understanding these two concepts was associated with both formal education and the number of math and science courses taken. Older respondents were less likely than younger adults to respond correctly to these two questions. Men and women were about equally likely to answer these questions correctly (appendix table 7-15).",1386682686

Also note that the more nodes in a distributed system are &quot;decoupled&quot; from the point of view of failures (different physical networks / equipment, different datacenter), the more you are likely adding latency.<p>But the point in the discussion was <i>never</i> that, since synchronous replication by default is already, exactly as you express in your message, not the Redis business, so fsync or not, Redis Cluster is not going to feature &quot;C&quot;. WAIT and its semantics ended taking all the attention, because you know, if your work is to show &quot;C&quot; is violated, you tend to focus there, regardless of the system analyzed not claiming to be consistent.<p>As for Redis Cluster, many places where Redis is used in the right way, in the environments you say people are happy with Redis, would benefit from the automatic sharding and the operational simplicity that Redis Cluster can provide to Redis, this is why Redis Cluster is IMHO a good milestone in the roadmap.",1386682424

6880549,comment,6880361,6880361,14,0,rdtsc,,,"> If a multithreaded program is unreliable it’s most likely due to the same reasons that single-threaded programs fail: The programmer didn’t follow basic, well known development practices.<p>Well no. It is like saying mt programs are broken because the user didn&#x27;t know how to write them. It is not saying much. Everything with bugs is broken because the writer didn&#x27;t know how to write it.<p>The reality is that multi-threaded is hard because it is hard to reason about and hard to get right. In one large application it only takes on junior programmer to dip their fingers in and add that one module that will crash the system 1 out 1000 run on customer&#x27;s hardware only.<p>MT issues and problems on a whole new level of difficulty that is qualitatively different than what single threaded programs experience. Sequential problems and bugs are still there, but now there are a host of completely new things happening.<p>> These programs very often fit nicely into a producer-consumer model with three threads:<p>* The input thread reads data and places it on the input queue.<p>Well, you also have to make sure the queue is thread safe. Understand what does it mean to get an item off of an empty queue. Now you have queue-using-up-all-my-memory problem if you do stream processing with mis-matching processing rates between parts of your programs.  What about objects you put in the queue. If those have any pointers or are pointers themselves now you are back to the original problem. So make sure objects are copies, are serialized/deserialized or there is proper ownership handoff.<p>In summary, is it possible to write correct highly concurrent programs in a shared memory model with threads/and-or/events -- yes. Is it easy? No, it is not easy.<p>The article correctly points the often common fallacy that using event/callback-based single threaded approach is superior and avoids all the concurrency related issue. It doesn&#x27;t avoid all issues. Now the race is between callback/errback chains instead of threads. Granularity is much higher (if incrementing a shared 64 bit int is fine without a lock). But the need to protect shared data structures is still there. The danger is psychological because one thinks &quot;hey this is safe, I don&#x27;t need anything to worry about&quot;<p>That is why I believe it is better to use a language/system/framework that uses isolated heaps and rigidly enforces separation between concurrency units. Erlang has that, D has some of that, Nimrod, Web Workers and Dart isolates to that. You incur a speed penalty for that. Don&#x27;t be shy about using regular Unix OS processes. Those are great for isolation and do it well. The cost of IPC and cost of creating them can also be high. You in incur a penalty for copying data between concurrency units, but remember, there is a bigger penalty you incur when the program has crashed. The converse of that is, the biggest performance gain your application will achieve is when it goes from not working to working and staying working.",1386682089

6880525,comment,6880361,6880361,35,0,sz4kerto,,,"> If you need a lock, then you probably have global mutable state that has to be protected against concurrent updates. The existence of global mutable state indicates a flaw in the application’s design, which you should review and change.<p>No, no, no. If you are writing multithreaded programs, you _will_ have locks, period. The question is whether you explicitly use them or if they are hidden somewhere in your libraries, frameworks, etc. Actually, the latter are much more difficult to debug. Most of us have probably seen situations where deadlocks or data corruption has occured because of some extremely complicated interaction of message pumps - UI thread - callbacks - async operations - etc., without any explicit locking.<p>> Perhaps most importantly, modern programming languages and libraries make it easy to create a producer-consumer application.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s great again, until the deadlock-corruption-indeterminism problem comes back again in a different abstraction level.<p>There is _no way out_. If you are writing concurrent apps, you have understand what&#x27;s happening. By concurrent I mean concurrent on the level you are working on. Using a parallel &#x27;map&#x27; operation is different because the concurrency is an implementational detail from your perspective. But if you are writing a massively concurrent quoting/trading engine, then you have to know what&#x27;s happening. And if you do, then you&#x27;re free to use locks, executors, async, whatever -- it&#x27;s just a tool to solve the problem.<p>...<p>The more I look at this article the more ridiculous it seems...",1386681557

For me it&#x27;s the latter, never the former.<p>Mind you, I said nothing about Notch being a great or bad programmer/designer, I simply disagree with the logic.",1386680966

Many women, at least by my anecdotal experience, see sex as something that they give up, and are expected to, after certain checkpoints in a dating relationship. I&#x27;ve never seen a man express this particular feeling.<p>I mention Manhattan for a reason: it&#x27;s got an unbalanced gender ratio and the highest percentage of single men in the country. At least anecdotally, women express a noticeably greater frustration with not being in a committed relationship than in other parts of the country. In a way it&#x27;s quite the opposite phenomenon of what I saw in my engineering days, with a disproportionately male crowd dissatisfied by their dating prospects. However, there is a palpable difference in the attitude of the two groups towards sex. The men were upset they weren&#x27;t having sex. The women date, and have sex if they want, but are somewhat resentful about it because they&#x27;d rather settle down.",1386680864

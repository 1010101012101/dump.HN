It seems more like the standard gripe that functional programmers have about state, even though it is not phrased that way.<p>He is objecting to dynamically changing some of the methods in the string class leading to subtle bugs as some code is written assuming the old string class and some using the new string class. Pheraps just explicitly define a separate custom-string class, or as he points out use mixins.",1215986378

245341,comment,245110,245110,0,0,cia_plant,,,"Atwood seems to equivocate between ""monkey patching,"" ""monkey patching built in classes like String,"" and ""metaprogramming.""<p>There are good reasons to be careful of monkey-patching, especially monkey-patching of built in classes, but they are essentially identical to the reasons that you want to be careful of all global state. There are other forms of metaprogramming, such as macros or templates, which are more local and safe.<p>I guess the real issue is between ""make potentially bad choices annoying and difficult to use, so that programmers feel bad about using them,"" versus ""support all programming as well as possible, trusting the programmer to avoid bad patterns."" I think that the latter attitude is more realistic: a determined bad programmer can write bad code even in Haskell or Ada or Java, and sometimes those ""bad"" patterns are useful (e.g., gotos are a great way to write a DFA).",1215985103

Yes it is data, but it should be data related to display.<p>Writing a webapp you don't even really need to use html at all apart from to bootstrap your app. Then you can build the UI yourself instead, which I think ends up as a nicer design and more elegant solution often.

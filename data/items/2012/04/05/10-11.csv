In the office it's hard to focus like that as everyone around you is talking about football scores, people are on conference calls with the speakerphone on etc.<p>I don't think it works for all types of roles, but for me it doesn't really matter where I am.  I work on servers remotely, I dial into conference calls and communication between team mates happens over IM/Email.<p>I have worked for employers in the past where they had the attitude of ""If you're not in the office, you're not working"".

3801993,comment,3788497,3788497,3,0,DanBC,,,"I have some sympathy for the article writer.  S/he was perhaps a bit hyperbolic.<p>I'd suggest just taking business cards to the parties; meet people, swap cards, get a few details, and then leave when it gets too much.  That's really the only use you'll get from them.  But at least you've made the introduction and a follow-up email a few days later will get some results.<p>Excessive drinking is a problem.  In the UK we have a concept of ""Units of alcohol"" to try to help people understand how much alcohol they drink.  Men should have no more than 3 or 4 units per day.  (women no more than 2 or 3. (Current advice is none at all while pregnant, but that's based on a precautionary principle because the safe limit isn't known, rather than known harm at 1 unit per week.))  They also recommend some drink free days each week, and strongly suggest that units cannot be ""saved up"" to use later in the week.  (EG: Drink free monday through thursday then fockin' blindo friday and saturday.) One unit of alcohol used to be a pub measure of spirits, or half a pint of beer, or a small glass of wine.  Because alcohol strength has increased beer and wine are often more than one unit in a pub measure.<p>One unit is 125 ml of wine at 8% Alcohol by Volume.  Most wine is sold in 150 ml or 175 ml (for a small glass) and 250 ml for a large glass.  Most wine is at least 10% ABV, but 12% is not uncommon.<p>This nice chart shows 250 ml at 12%ABV is 3 units.  One large glass a day is skirting the safe drinking limits.<p>(<a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Units_of_alcohol_chart.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Units_of_alcohol_char...</a>)<p>It's easy to see that people drinking a couple of glasses of wine in the evenings after work do not see themselves as having a problem with alcohol.  Add in extra social time drinking and some people get very high levels of alcohol.<p>It really is a problem in the UK.<p>This article mentions someone drinking a remarkable amount:<p>(<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-15997695"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-15997695</a>)<p>But these articles mention much more reasonable drinking is also a problem:<p>(<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16869618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16869618</a>)<p>(Very annoyingly they say things like ""triples the risk of mouth cancer"" which is meaningless to most people.)<p>And this article recommends some time to recover after heavy drinking:<p>(<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15415713"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15415713</a>)<p>This article has some suggestions about binge drinking in the UK.  We have weird pubs - vertical drinking environments - where seating is limited, music is noisy, food isn't served.  All these things increase the amount that people drink.  While it's technically illegal to serve someone who is drunk I've never ever seen anyone refused alcohol, and I have seen many people barely able to ask for the drink being served.<p>(<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16466646"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16466646</a>)",1333621399

Here's the best way I can express this: when _why left the Ruby community and deleted his online presence, several people created collections of all of the open-source software which _why had written, without _why's permission. That sort of collection is illegal under French law; an English translation of the relevant statute says, ""The author alone shall have the right to make a collection of his articles and speeches and to publish them or to authorize their publication in such form."" That right is not transferable, you can't get rid of it, etc.<p>There is a related nasty moral right in France about withdrawing your copyrighted works -- ""Notwithstanding assignment of his right of exploitation, the author shall enjoy a right to reconsider or of withdrawal, even after publication of his work, with respect to the assignee.""

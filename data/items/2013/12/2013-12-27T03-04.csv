If you want to skip to the main accusation of hypocrisy, it is:<p><pre><code>    Speaking of facts: While presenting itself as the champion\n    of the working classes, the fact is Dentons Gawker empire is\n    guilty of almost every crime it accuses the tech industry of\n    committing, and several it doesnt. Denton, who now\n    encourages others to sneer at Silicon Valleys elite social\n    clubs, made his own millions as co-founder of First Tuesday,\n    an elite social club which spanned Europe during the first\n    dot com boom. While crying foul at the off-shore tax dodging\n    of San Francisco tech companies, Gawker Media is registered\n    in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying US taxes, an\n    arrangement which the New Yorker described as like an\n    international money-laundering operation. As Valleywag howls\n    that Google interns earn more than you, Gawker Media is\n    currently the subject of a class action lawsuit over its\n    earlier refusal to pay its own interns a dime for their\n    labour. And how about Valleywags mockery of lavish Silicon\n    Valley workplaces? Why not ask Denton about that when you\n    visit his steampunk office, featuring a lounge area that\n    looks like its straight out of the blue pill/red pill scene\n    in The Matrix, an office surfboard and a rooftop party deck?\n    Business Insider claims its one of the 15 coolest offices in\n    tech. And while youre there, make sure to also ask him about\n    Gawkers Privilege Tournament, a smug little contest in which\n    Gawker readers were invited to vote on which underprivileged\n    group (choices include: black, blind, transgender, people\n    with AIDS, the homeless, overeducated, and fat) should win\n    by virtue of its sweet, sweet moral superiority  or as\n    Salons Katrina Richardson called the tournament: a\n    shamefully racist, sexist, homophobic and classist attempt\n    to silence large swaths of people.</code></pre>",1388116363

They propose a change to the protocol that makes it a >25% percent problem, but currently it is a >0% problem. That is kind of a big deal. There are some good ideas in the &quot;proof of stake&quot; discussions, but none of the answers appear to lend support to the &quot;triangle is squared&quot; hypothesis.</i><p>I was looking for that paper a while ago! Somehow my google-fu failed me and I got distracted by something else, and so, forgot about it for a while.<p>Thanks to you, I&#x27;ve had a chance to download the paper and read it.<p>Indeed, at first glance it might seem like they&#x27;re pointing out a big hole in BTC, but I don&#x27;t think this is the case, and neither do a lot of other folks over on the BTCtalk forum. [1]<p>There is one big flaw in their paper that the authors acknowledge (quite poorly IMO) in their followup blog post to the reactions that they received [2], and that is point #9, that they for some reason buried toward the bottom of the blog post:<p><pre><code>    Our paper does not address what happens when multiple pools employ the\n    selfish strategy. But if all pools were selfish, the blockchain would\n    not make forward progress for large periods of time, while selfish\n    groups hoard their blocks. Then, perhaps, depending on the profit-\n    taking strategy of the selfish miners and their relative sizes, it\n    would take erratic large steps forward. Such erratic behavior would\n    not bode well for the users who want to transact in the currency.\n</code></pre>\nIndeed, what happens if more than one pool decides to follow this strategy? They must have been too trigger-happy to publish their paper to analyze the significance of that rather obvious question, which demands an answer.<p>I say that it demands an answer because the probability that exactly one pool would implement this strategy is, I think, close to zero.<p>For some strange reason, the authors (in their blog post) decided to jump to the other extreme and analyze the case where <i>&quot;all pools were selfish&quot;</i>! Well, that&#x27;s a rather silly thing to do, because you don&#x27;t go from 0% to 100% in one leap like that, so their analysis there, and related commentary, can simply be dismissed.<p>The interesting question remains: what happens when <i>some</i> pools start to implement this strategy?<p>I do not know for sure, but I suspect that the result will be a wash, so to speak, and most likely will end poorly for the cheaters (when they are caught). Their entire paper is based on the absurd claim that a single selfish pool will grow, like some sort of cancer, until it reaches 51% proportions (and then it&#x27;s game over). While this is a possibility, at the moment it seems like an exceedingly remote one. In fact, the more cheating pools there are that use this strategy, the less likely their vision of a BTC doomsday becomes. Which group of bandits should one join, and is it worth the risk?<p>Speaking of risk, Stephen Gornick quickly pointed out a simple technique for detecting these cheaters: <i>&quot;\nWouldn&#x27;t it be easy to tell if a block seems to be coming from a selfish pool (as each new block will appear to be laggng since it has no recently arrived transactions)?  So if this lag can be detected then cannot an incentive to honest pools be offered?&quot;</i> [3]<p>> <i>If the goal is to describe a system that is resilient to eavesdropping, you shouldn&#x27;t distract from that system in the same paper with so much argument about why you want a system resilient to eavesdropping.</i><p>On this issue, I think we simply differ in opinion. I did not consider that section to be a distraction. Rather, I considered it to be an essential part of the paper, without which it would have been lacking. I think it would have been a disservice to the two projects (and to the paper itself) had I left the motivation section out. Only a tiny fraction of the intended audience of the paper is like you (already convinced of the need for an ubiquitous surveillance proof system of communication).<p>> <i>&quot;meta-domain&quot; is a very strange term to use. It makes you sound ignorant of the realities of DNS, whether you are or not.</i><p>What term would you prefer then? It&#x27;s a somewhat novel concept (so far as I know).<p>> <i>My statement was that a proxy to namecoin doesn&#x27;t add much to the system. The first and fourth of your bullet points might be paraphrased as &quot;but it adds a proxy to namecoin!&quot;</i><p>I agree on your last point, that the first and fourth bullets can be (somewhat inaccurately) summarized in that way, but I strongly disagree with the notion that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t add much to the system.&quot; It makes Namecoin usable. That&#x27;s huge.<p>> <i>What would be the purpose of adding DNSCrypt to DNSNMC? What do you mean by &quot;secure queries&quot; there? Anonymous queries? Validated responses?

America&#x27;s military power is in decline, but more importantly, its political influence is tanking. So the end of empire is here.<p>At this point it looks like Russia will be the next imperial world power although they are certainly doing it differently than other empires of the past. The Euro-Asian Union is likely to officially hold the crown but as we all know, the size of Russia will mean that it dominates in that Union.<p>Of course, that empire too will run its course and I wonder if humanity can continue on the road paved by Russia. First, it was the Russian people who ended the Soviet Union and that was a remarkably peaceful event because Russians actually don&#x27;t like wars. Next, the way that they are building the EAU as a partnership based on the model of the EU holds out some hope that it will be an empire that is less willing to throw its weight around globally. And finally, there has to be an end to empire. We humans have to learn how to share this planet under a different covenant than the one given to us by history. The EU is an example that all countries need to emulate, not by expanding the EU but by applying the EU principles in a broader more global way so that countries are no longer sovereign, but are subject to some sort of regional federation which mediates political and social affairs within and without the countries in the region.",1388115493

The actual &quot;fall&quot; of the USSR came at the dissolution of the lands conquered by the old Russian Empire. The tensions driving that, besides obvious greed for money and power, were that those pieces weren&#x27;t always together to begin with. Russia, Belarus and most of Ukraine were, but much of the rest was absorbed through violence. Even today, Ukraine&#x27;s west and east are at odds with each other - one part wanting to come back to Russia and the other wanting to go back to Poland/Europe.<p>The military strength is likely to depend a lot more on unmanned machinery in the next few decades rather than on human soldiers. If true, that would erode much of the advantage China and India hold from the sheer numbers stand point.<p>Economically, China may very well develop to be #1. That said, they do have a long road ahead of them in terms of really sustaining their own buying behaviors. Currently, US is #1 through much of its own consumption. This is a very remarkable feat. The extremely robust domestic market is not something most other countries can really boast. Currently, both India and China need others to consume a very large share of what they produce.

I left San Francisco 2 years ago after being priced out of affordable living and I have no resentment to anyone working at a company that provides a lot of perks.  So why am I lumped in with some guy at Instagram driving his Lambo to his mansion?

But as you used a model github to illustrate your point, let me use a model - airplane - to illustrate mine:<p>I have this idea, an airplane. I figured out that the Bernoulli effect can be created by designing a wing that has less area on one side than the other, thereby creating a vacuum and lifting the plane up. There - the &quot;core&quot; of my application (of physics, not of software) is done. I have a functioning prototype and a solid theoretical foundation for proving it works. I&#x27;m at 95%.<p>What&#x27;s left is to outsource all this menial shit. My QA staff advised me that when two propellers vibrate at the same RPM, harmonics are created that destroy the airframe. They also found out the design fails in icy weather. Oh well, a subcontractor can install a heater. The current airframe design is so weak that  it creates a condition such that the plane can take off but cannot immediately land, as the weight of the fuel will damage the wings.<p>Oh well, I&#x27;ve got it 95% there...",1388113547

Let&#x27;s momentarily replace the thing in the chinese room with a human, to parse Searle&#x27;s notion of &quot;understanding&quot;.  Searle would argue that a human trained in to emit meaningful chinese characters would still lack understanding.  But I think this is backwards and speaks to your identification of Searle begging the question: the only way a human could emit meaningful chinese responses would be if it had an understanding of chinese.  Consequently if a machine is outputting meaningful chinese, it too must already understand chinese, and any argument otherwise is kind of a pro-biology bigotry with a shaky underlying logic at best.<p>This then devolves into semantics.  Can a person locked in a room really come to &quot;understand&quot; chinese culture, for example, if only non-experiential learning were used as data inputs?

10743156,comment,10741954,10743014,0,0,Xylakant,,,"> Why write a slow clunky old email when a Slack message will do?<p>Because email is threaded conversations, while slack is not. I can write 5 different emails and respond to each thread individually, but I can&#x27;t do that in slack: I can write 5 messages, but my peer(s) can&#x27;t answer each one individually - they can just write 5 messages and I have to figure out what they respond to.<p>Email has the added benefit of working nicely when you&#x27;re on a connection that&#x27;s not always available (mobile, traveling, etc.) I can write the message and have it sent later, download all messages and read (and answer) them without a connection. Slack (and other chat applications) just falls flat on it&#x27;s face when the connection drops from time to time.<p>Now, all of that might be properties that you don&#x27;t need because you&#x27;re never traveling and always on the same schedule, so that you&#x27;re able to answer questions in real time - but don&#x27;t assume that&#x27;s true for everyone.",1450257136

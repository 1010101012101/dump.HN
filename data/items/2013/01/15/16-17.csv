But I don't often get all four, so I should sacrifice the language preference for the fit stuff. This makes sense, but I'd take it a step further and say that oftentimes (at least in this day and age) you get one, maybe two of the four and the required compromise is much deeper.

I quote liberally from the article:<p>> It turns out that a few years ago, someone sued the Franchise Tax Board over being denied the right to claim the QSB benefit [Cutler v. Franchise Tax Bd., 208 Cal. App. 4th 1247 (2012)]. The company at issue in that lawsuit did not meet one of the QSB requirementsthat it maintain 80 percent of its employees and assets in California. In August of 2012, the California Court of Appeals sided with the plaintiff, ruling that denying him the QSB exclusion based on the 80 percent requirement was an unconstitutional violation of the interstate commerce clause.<p>> Since the FTB lost the case, you might think that they would strike the unconstitutional requirement and keep the rest of QSB statute intact. Not a chance.<p>> What the FTB did instead was to take their ball and go home. They decided that since they could not impose the 80 percent requirement, no one would be entitled to the QSB exclusion. They put out an announcement terminating the Qualified Small Business exclusion and retroactively disqualifying all exclusions and deferrals going all the way back to 2008.",1358268954

5061170,comment,5059044,5060146,3,0,willyt,,,"It's not quite correct to say that Scots law is entirely independent though. It's true that The High Court of Justiciary is the highest court of appeal for Scottish criminal cases, but the Supreme Court of the UK (formerly the House of Lords) is the highest court of appeal for civil cases in the UK and decisions in Scotland can be appealed there. However, the rules and procedures of Scots law are different and so judgements in England which are used as precedents in Scotland have to be reinterpreted in the light of Scots law and visa versa. I know for a fact that there is a standard contract clause which <i>currently</i> has a different interpretation in England versus Scotland because neither of the interpretations have yet been appealed in the Supreme Court. As you can imagine this can cause endless amounts of expensive legal haggling. Scots and English law also use very different legal terminology and procedures for many everyday processes.

It turns out, however, that this is not a good opinion to express when trying to do well in English in a conservative public state school.<p>As to Earth Science, I was not penalized for my response; had it been, this would have been clearly objectionable. On the other hand, at the time I did feel that it was unfair in that one could give what I considered a cop-out answer for full credit.

If you read comments here on HN, you can see the same attitude - that since there was no real security, it wasn't a crime, since he didn't lie to anyone they couldn't claim he misrepresented himself to get access, etc.  I think that Aaron honestly believed that what he was doing was ""hacking the legal system"" - accomplishing his goal by exploiting loopholes in the law rather than breaking it.<p>What he found out was that the people in the legal system do not take kindly to being ""hacked"".  Rather than give a wry smile and say ""You got us this time, Aaron Swartz!"", the prosecutor grabbed on to the part that she thought she could make stick and went for it.  The rest is, as they say, history.  There are a lot of lessons in what happened, but one that I haven't seen get much mention here on HN is that the US legal system is comprised of people, with all the advantages and disadvantages that that entails.  It's not something that should be ""hacked"" lightly or by the unprepared, because the consequences are not always as deterministic as you might think they should be.<p>On a side note, I think your comment about HN being ""abusive"" lately is spot-on.

Six years would have been even better than that.<p>Look at Kevin Mitnick (the exception to the rule mentioned above), Adrian Lamo, Mark Abene, Kevin Poulsen, etc, etc... They've all had successful careers either as Security Consultants, Technologists/Speakers, Journalists, et al.

Aaron Swartz could have pleaded guilty (he did steal the documents and trespass) and do his 6 months or go to trial and end up doing a couple of years - and come out a hero with a strengthened cause and higher profile. A Reddit cofounder and high profile activist doing some jail time for his cause is something that would not have been forgotten.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm on Aaron's side. The charges where preposterous and the way he was treated was barbaric. I can definitely sympathize. That been said I would have taken the charges and 6 months of jail time as a badge of honor.

Small biases in real life become <i>massive</i> online. Someone who might have a back-of-the-mind thought ""oh, he's short"" IRL will make it a dealbreaker. Someone who might have a back-of-the-mind ""oh, he's black"" IRL will make <i>that</i> a dealbreaker also.

People are, by a remarkable degree, more racist, more classist, and more judgmental than they behave in real life, to a degree they're not even fully aware of. A more cynical person might say that's a truer expression of the self, but I don't think it's that simplistic. In many ways the traditional online dating setup <i>magnifies</i> biases and makes mountains out of mole hills, and in that way works against the interests of the user.<p>OKCupid doesn't really help matters.

For example these days CPUs are much more optimal in terms of <i>cycles per instruction</i> and inversely <i>instructions per cycle</i>. Back then when multiplication of two word-sized(8 bits back then) values took 24 cycles, these days we can do that in 12 cycles for 64-bit values. Because of superscalar processing and thus instruction level parallelism, we can typically do 2-4 ALU operations in parallel(given that there's no data dependencies) and thus increase the instruction throughput 2-4 fold. Then, because of SIMD features and data level parallelism we can do same operaton on multiple data(say, operate on a vector of 4 elements in a single cycle) and thus we eliminate the need for repeated instructions.<p>This all gets a bit complicated in modern days because of memory access costs and caches which try to alleviate the costs, but the idea is that modern CPUs are likely to be around 10 times as fast <i>per-clock</i> as 6502 and because of multiple cores and threads that value goes to something like 40-60. Add the huge increase in clock speed and you're a bit south from x100_000 in optimal case.<p>I would hope every programmer would write some core on a C64 to really learn how much RAM the 64 KB really is.

Unfortunately (except for the school resources issue) they are all completely out of the teacher/school/district's ability to control.<p>Whenever teacher/school issues come up, it is important to remember that far beyond anything a school or teacher can do, the single-most important factor in a child's education (or their life in general!) is their PARENTS.  If a kid has parents who value education, discipline their kids and make time for learning at home, that kid can do just fine no matter what kind of conditions they experience at school.  Conversely, it takes a Stand and Deliver-style superteacher to be able to coax success out of a kid growing up in a home where education is not valued and productive personal habits are not modeled.<p>The biggest problem with education?  There are far, far too many parents out there who have absolutely no business raising children at all.  We require tests for people to operate a jet ski, but when it comes to absolute power and responsibility for a human child, anybody can do it!  That's your right!  Don't worry about saddling the rest of society with your child who doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of ending up well-adjusted, educated or successful. It's YOUR kid.<p>I understand that people who are struggling with extreme poverty are often too caught up with bare survival to find the time to focus on their children's educational needs. That is really awful and sad. It is especially sad for their children.<p>The fact is, as long as society is full of self-centered, thoughtless parents who either fail to understand the basic components of child-rearing or are too busy surviving to care, we will be plagued with students who are going to struggle no matter how great of an educational system they are placed in.<p>That being said, perhaps the only way to raise a generation of education-valuing, quality parents is to do what we can to create them.  So maybe it is best after all to focus on what CAN be done - effective teaching methods for today's teachers.  Hopefully a much-improved school system can help raise the prospects of children whose parents are doing nothing to give them a hand up.  And then they in turn can become the kinds of nurturing, education-valuing parents that their own children deserve.",1358267026

5060875,comment,5059557,5059557,8,0,memset,,,"I think the top-voted answer here is totally off.<p>In c2008, during college, I worked at IBM on mainframes for internships and co-ops. I worked on the Omegamon products on z/OS. Later I worked at Fidelity, where I was minimally involved with mainframe programming.<p>First, mainframes are <i>awesome</i> from an architectural perspective. As one example: when you run a program, you must (I'm simplifying a bit) specify exactly which files it is allowed to access. Moreover, when you create those files, they aren't allowed to grow infinitely - OS will enforce a maximum rate at which a file can grow, and a maximum file size.<p>Or, mainframes have been doing virtual machines for <i>decades</i>. In fact, the only sane way to run a mainframe is to slice it up and run VMs on it. ""zVM"" is written in assembly and runs z/OS VMs. Nowadays it also runs RHEL VMs. I hear they're putting Intel CPUs in mainframes to run Windows VMs too.<p>There's more, but I just want to illustrate that the granularity from a security perspective is fantastic. There are tons of technical and features that, in my view, would be very interesting to the computer crowd.<p>So why aren't young people interested?<p>First, nobody knows what mainframes are, except that they are dinosaurs and old and slow and whatever. Sun used to give universities pallets of computers running Unix - so guess what university students learned! IBM is trying to bring awareness with their Master the Mainframe competition (which is fun!) or sponsoring Senior Project courses throughout the country.<p>The OP is right that mainframes aren't available to learn on. And they're so <i>different</i> from the concepts we are familiar with that it is difficult to jump in. ""Learn z/OS The Hard Way?"" ""Codecademy: OMVS Edition""<p>Do realize that every time you swipe your credit card, you are <i>very likely</i> hitting a mainframe in a bank somewhere. Talk about throughput.<p>The OP is correct in that if you're not working <i>for IBM</i> writing their mainframe products, you're probably at an awful soul-sucking bank writing COBOL. And really, the COBOL itself is probably not as bad as the fact that nobody knows it and these banks are notoriously bad at documentation or mentoring young people to bring them up to speed. Honestly working at a bank sucks. But banks user mainframes, and banks == bad, and mainframes == slow (somehow), so they are a no-go.<p>If you do work for IBM on their mainframe teams, those guys are honestly the smartest engineers I have ever worked with. They're all, well, old, but they know C and assembly (lots of mainframe software is written in those languages) inside and out. They understand networks. How to increase throughput. If your webapp crashes, nobody cares. If your bank's mainframe has a segfault you are fucked.<p><i>But</i> then you are working in a very specific part of a very large company. Many young people work at IBM and are content there! They recruit heavily from my alma mater. But perhaps the <i>types of young folks</i> who are on HN, stackoverflow, etc are not really interested in working at IBM, much less learning about an esoteric technology. It will only keep you employable in a narrow (and soul-sucking) part of the industry.",1358266465

Realize the obvious that that documentation should not get in the way from the project responding to customer needs (i.e. code base being agile), and therefore the documentation must be ideally as less as possible. And that finally, there needs to be a way to find the right type of documentation when you want it.<p>I think the last part is a field where there needs to be research.

We started talking about business, design, and many of the things we felt Apple was doing right. I'm not sure how long we spoke, but it was definitely a good hour. After speaking for such a long time, we ended up exchanging emails.<p>Every once in a while (few months or so) we'd touch base with each other just to see how things were going. I had been working on my own business, while he was working for some bigger corporations like Reuters. Months and months would go bye between conversations, but there was always this feeling that we had about working with each other. He, being a developer, and me being an entrepreneur, we kept talking about the idea of working together, but nothing really came of it. We did do a little podcast that a lot of people listened to (<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-and-motivation/id477246407"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-and-motivation/...</a>).<p>Anyways, our personal conversations went back and forth for years  almost 5 to be exact. And then one day I approach him with this idea that I already started. He had become a much better developer and quite frankly, through our conversations he came off as a real hard worker. Someone who wants to make it. He even helped me with some things for free which was really nice. That combination of hard work and him being a developer was almost too good to be true. We chatted on the phone a bit, and then I flew out to NYC (where he lives) to meet up for the second time in 5 years. Things went well. We talked a lot and he introduced me to an amazing designer who has also ended up being the 3rd co-founder of our company.<p>Now here we are about 6 months later and we've been working really hard on rebuilding an idea that we think is going to be really great.

The way it works now (e.g., on okcupid) is that you fill out a profile and answer some questions. You expose some signals in your profile which you think are correlated with what makes you a good mate (interests, income, etc.), and go about finding such signals in other people's profiles. The match % is also such a signal. However,<p>1. People lie, or at least exaggerate the truth/selectively filter<p>2. They might not lie but simply be wrong: they think they want x but actually want y<p>3. The match % is a completely made up algorithm. I mean, it kind of makes sense that people who agree on things they care the most about would make good couples, but unless you measure this in a scientific way (i.e., controlled experiments), you have no idea.<p>4. Even assuming that you can actually get a good signal from the profile, it is drowned out by the noise. Suppose that some girl and dude are perfect for each other. What are the chances that he will find her profile and that she will read his message?<p>The solution to 1-3 is to measure the thing you want to optimize, instead of optimizing based on intuition. The solution to 4 is to set people using the thing that you measured. So, after each blind date, you ask the participants, ""would you go on a date with this person again?"" Imagine being okcupid and being able to say, here is a person I think you'd be interested in dating, and I can say with 95% confidence that you will have a good time. If they can get to that stage, they'd be able to make good money.<p>There are some issues with this, of course. You could argue that the thing they should measure is whether the date leads to a happy long-term relationship, but that's pretty much infeasible for various reasons. Also, as a dating website, they'd be perversely incentivized to keep you single forever. Anyway, I am super interested to see how this does.",1358265820

5060775,comment,5059737,5059976,5,0,ameister14,,,"I grew up in two very different places; Bethesda, MD and Winthrop, ME. The former is a fairly wealthy suburb of DC. The latter is an extremely rural mill-town in Maine.<p>I know that the funding the schools get is blamed for a lot of their problems, and I understand where people who talk about how hard it is to teach kids with behavioral issues and histories of abuse are coming from.<p>I sympathize, but I also think that's a cop-out. I had bad teachers in both places. In Winthrop, I had horrible teachers. They took away advanced classes because an outside contractor thought it created elitist attitudes and putting smart kids in the regular classes would boost overall performance.<p>I had science teachers that just had us play with legos all day and gave A's to all the basketball players. I had math teachers that would lose assignments and blame the students. These were not well-meaning teachers that just had it hard trying to teach these poor kids. These were people that shouldn't have been teaching at all, but could not be replaced.<p>My parents actually went up to the school a few times to try and talk to the administration and teachers about what was going on. A lot of people did. They got push-back and were asked not to meddle.<p>There were 2 great teachers there and that's why I didn't completely screw up my life at that point. I've spoken to a lot of people with similar experiences; 1 great teacher that pushed them to be successful. That's why it's so maddening to me when people say that it's not the teacher's fault, that they can't do anything about it. I know that's not entirely what your intent with your post was, but focusing on external environmental issues and bemoaning the poverty of the student body can come across that way.<p>While poverty is a major issue, and teaching is hard, I don't think you can solve the problems by just changing the student's home environment. You have to change the teachers as well.<p>Lots of jobs are hard. Doctors have to deal with unruly patients who refuse to change their diet or exercise.

Although I'm a believer in emergent properties of large systems, the initial reputation should be tied to domain expertise. Let a group of really smart folks set the standard and promote intelligent answers.",1251197997

784593,comment,784257,784257,0,0,messel,,,"You've exposed some systematic weaknesses of the SO quality score. If I worked for SO I'd thank you.<p>My proposed solution is to manually identify X judges who represent a nicecross section of programming backgrounds. These judges are selected by their continued support and passion for helping programmers. Over time their upvotes would create new quality judges in an intelligent manner.<p>I used a system like this for characterizing 3D shapes in the protein database (kinase). The templates were created from known kinase chains, we called them motifs. Thanks to Tony Sommese, and Jim Dwulit for really making it happen (I just helped out on that project).<p>Another case for this model is crystal formation. Seed crystals allow for fractal like formation of patterns in supporting media dishes.<p>Googles voting system also relies on ""reliable"" sources to help judge the value of links.<p>Reference papers use citations to determine how close an author is to a renowned scientist.",1251197770

They didn't seem to regard this as a bad thing.<p>At one point when I started working on the ""better answer"" straight after a ""good answer"", the interviewer asked me why. I confessed that it looked to be a similar class of problem to one in the previous interview, and he told me that was excellent.<p>There were two problems I did badly at. One was a math question (number theory), which I got after a bit of work. The other didn't really get anywhere with. It wasn't included in any of these linked items, either, so I guess I can't say much more about it. It was a fair question though.",1251197673

Having a decent salary is just to get the employee willing to work - not as an incentive to work at max capacity.<p>What we're talking about, really, is already past salary: is a group of fairly paid people more efficient and creative when motivated financially (say, by extra bonuses or salary increases) or by promises of autonomy (say, 20% time).<p>Thus, the candle problem, when placed in the real world, would have three groups: a control group which is paid 'decently and fairly', and a group that is paid 'decently and fairly' and is given financial incentives beyond that, and a group that is payed 'decently and fairly' and is given autonomy as an incentive.",1251197608

Everything else seems ery uncertain - yes, I could have learned to do my job in a fraction of my schooling, but there are many things in my schooling that have nothing to do with my current job, yet which I value immensely (probably more so than my directly employable skills, even). As a matter of fact, I spent most of college avoiding (as much as I could while getting the degree) practical CS, precisely because I knees learning it on my own would be a lot better use of the time. Instead, I tried to focus on things to which I'd have limited exposure in my career - Shakespeare, writing, theoretical mathematics, etc.",1251197239

(Think of it as a distributed legal kernel rather than a monolithic one. Oh, and the acts can be revised/amended by parliament without needing a constitutional convention or equivalent.)<p>There's no actual fifth amendment equivalent, but there _is_ a bill of rights (at least, since 1998). RiderOfGiraffes is exactly right about silence being a factor that can be drawn to the attention of a jury ...<p>On the subject of the bits of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (2002) that make failure to hand over encryption keys an imprisonable offense, it's worth noting that an order to hand them over has first to be made in the process of a criminal investigation. If someone has encrypted data and refuses to hand over the keys despite facing a maximum 5-year prison term, then it's reasonable to presume that they consider the data to be so incriminating that they'd pull a _longer_ sentence if they decrypted it. I believe (but am not certain -- the powers have been used to rarely that there's little to go on) that a plausible explanation of why the keys are unavailable (""I generated a PGP keychain in 1996 out of curiousity, but I lost interest and stopped using it, and that was twelve PCs ago"") would probably work in court (in the absence of evidence contradicting it).",1251197019

Aluminum and iron used to be much more expensive and scarce. Now they're pretty cheap, and to find out why, just total the savings of lots of tiny improvements like thinner soda cans, better sorting of recycling, lower-energy production methods, etc.<p>If 50 people come up with cumulative improvements of 2% to a process, you end up with a 269% improvement.<p>This is one of the reasons why software is so appealing - it's low-capital to distribute, and there are an unending number of tasks to automate, making it easy to come up with new approaches to improve productivity.",1251196941

However, before one runs around, saying that rewards are ""often no motivator"", one should remember the basic premise of these studies:<p>""People were intrinsically motivated to complete a certain task, initially.""<p>In many economic contexts, this is seldomly the case. How many people are intrinsically motivated to fix a broken toilet, for example?<p>True, it may hold under certain circumstances -- so-called creative and similar work.<p>But developing software is not just creative work. There's also lots of boilerplate work to do to make software a good product: It needs to satisfy the wants and needs of the user, not the developer. It needs to be easy-to-use. It needs informative and reassuring promotion (ie. a nice homepage). It needs proper documentation. It needs to be easily installable and removable.<p>But even Free Software developers are not intrinsically motivated to provide these features. Thus, many Free Software projects fail badly as products.<p>Sure, there may be people out there who are intrinsically motivated to do some of these tasks - writing, for example. But when they are, they often have better things to create, namely their own creative works. Why should anyone who enjoys to write, care about the lack of documentation for some unknown software project, even if it's ""Free""?<p>This is why so-called ""non-free software"" is useful and necessary and hardly anything ""immoral"" or ""unethical"": It provides benefits lots of people want and need.<p>In other words: I doubt, the GNU project posted this on their web site to educate the public. Probably, they just did it to support their political agenda.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation_crowding_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation_crowding_theory</a>",1251195066

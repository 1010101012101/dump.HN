On the other hand, if they do anything I consider &quot;shifty&quot; like trying to hide the opt-in anywhere (eg in ToS), then the answer to your question is yes.

7625892,comment,7622432,7625451,5,0,omegaham,,,"That sounds about right. We abbreviate whatever we can if ideas become awkward.<p>For example, in the US military, there are a lot of concepts that are clumsy to say - for example, it&#x27;s pretty silly to refer to the Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization Program seventy times when you&#x27;re talking about why you need to change a safety protocol, so you just refer to it as the NATOPS. All of these concepts get abbreviated - Physical Fitness Test becomes PFT, Non-Judicial Punishment becomes NJP, Then people turn these into verbs, (Bill got NJP&#x27;d yesterday) and those get abbreviated as well, and pretty soon you end up with a totally new language that no one else can understand. I told this story to my girlfriend without even knowing that I was doing it:<p>&quot;[Name] got caught pencil-whipping a PM on the radar. Top wanted to fix him with &quot;EMI,&quot; but the OIC wanted him to burn, so it went to the CO for NJP. The CO is a pilot, so he maxed him out - took his pay, 45/45, reduction to PFC. Then, the SMaj told him he looked fat, so he got sent over to the S3 to weigh in. He&#x27;s over, and he didn&#x27;t tape out, so now he&#x27;s on BCP, too! He&#x27;s gonna get adsep&#x27;d if he keeps going the way he is.&quot;<p>My girlfriend started laughing at me, told me to repeat it, and laughed again. I realized that I was basically speaking another language, and then quickly realized that a bunch of the things I was talking about were alien to her anyway! This 90-second story became a thirty-minute discussion of what exactly &quot;taping out&quot; is, why Extra Military Instruction is a sarcastic term for &quot;told to weed the desert for twelve hours,&quot; and what&#x27;s so bad about the Body Composition Program. All of these concepts have been put into my brain from years of living with them, and describing them to someone else is often really difficult.<p>The tech world does the exact same thing. So does medicine, laboratory science, theater, band... We all have our own languages, created by common experiences and a need to communicate them to other people.",1398142572

I love drawing and sketching and it was actually via a flash game tutorial on Kongretate.com that I found my first serious entry point into programming.  Telling Tom about this, he started talking about drawing octocats and the entire conversation was about artwork.  Until someone told me otherwise about half an hour later, I thought he was the &quot;octocat guy&quot;, an artist who happened to be at a nice company.<p>It&#x27;s really rare in my life when I&#x27;ve been shocked by someone&#x27;s humility and congeniality, but meeting Tom was one of those times.

The author correctly leads off with the main reason Chinese is hard to learn as a second language, and not easy to learn to full literacy even for a native speaker. My HN user profile discloses that I am a second-language learner of Chinese. I began study of the language in 1975. There are all kinds of interesting challenges in learning Chinese. One that is underestimated is how much the various Sinitic languages (&quot;Chinese dialects&quot;) are not cognate even for vocabulary that would be cognate for French and Spanish, or for English and German. How you might write the conversation<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Mandarin?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>他會說普通話嗎？<p>他不會。<p>in Modern Standard Chinese characters contrasts with how you would write<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Cantonese?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>佢識唔識講廣東話？<p>佢唔識。<p>in the Chinese characters used to write Cantonese. As will readily appear even to readers who don&#x27;t know Chinese characters, many more words than &quot;Mandarin&quot; and &quot;Cantonese&quot; differ between those sentences in Chinese characters.<p>On the whole, I find Chinese grammar fits my preferences (I like languages in which word order is the main element of grammar, and dislike languages like most Indo-European languages with a lot of inflection shown by changes in word endings), I can deal with Chinese pronunciation (but my children find it much more &quot;natural&quot; than I do to use phonological tone to distinguish differing words, a common feature of many languages but not my native language, English), and I just have to suck it up and exert a lot of effort to be literate in Chinese, even with today&#x27;s computer aids.

Definitions are what he calls &quot;disguised queries.&quot; When someone says &quot;atheism is a religion&quot; or &quot;that&#x27;s not art,&quot; they&#x27;re trying to use the definition to make another statement - that atheists rely on faith, or that the work is not worthy of praise, display, etc.<p>The problem is that set membership isn&#x27;t always binary, and not all members of a set share all the same characteristics. Just because something isn&#x27;t difficult technically, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not art. More importantly, if you&#x27;re using &quot;not art&quot; to mean &quot;not difficult technically,&quot; then saying &quot;this isn&#x27;t difficult technically, so it&#x27;s not art&quot; isn&#x27;t a worthwhile statement. It&#x27;s the disguised implications of the word &quot;art&quot; which make such statements so contentious. To paraphrase Eliezer, the argument about what is and isn&#x27;t art is really a dispute over whether to infer art-related qualities of the work, like fitness for a museum.

7625724,comment,7624740,7624740,3,0,thinkpad20,,,"Honestly I think JavaScript is about as good as any other mainstream dynamic language, save the Lisps, for FP. I&#x27;m currently writing a functional language and compiling to JavaScript, for the precise reason that it&#x27;s a very straightforward translation. It&#x27;s certainly much better at it than Python, although I consider Python vastly superior in almost every other respect. However, I think that FP in a dynamic language is very difficult because of the lack of typing. In Haskell you can write incredibly intricate and expressive single-liners that would be 10 lines in another language (if you could do them at all), and are only really feasible because of the typing system (as in, it would require almost a miracle to get them right without a type system backing you up). I suppose Lisp people manage to get away with it, but on the other hand Lisp isn&#x27;t really functional the way the ML family of languages are.<p>As far as the data structures not being there, well, keep in mind that JavaScript is based on imperative languages; hence its focus on arrays and hash tables (both of which are almost always implemented mutably). Also, mutability is baked into the DOM, and short of doing everything in a monad, that looks to be the way it&#x27;s going to be, so again, it makes sense that JS was written as it was. When immutability is needed, use a library -- or just don&#x27;t use JavaScript.",1398139364

You don&#x27;t get to decide what other people care about. And I would confidently wager that virtually everyone is affected by things that so-called purists dismiss as not worth caring about. The notion that there is a concrete boundary between the art and the context is so simplistic, and it completely ignores basic psychology. Doesn&#x27;t it seem a little narcissistic to think that you would know what other people should care about?",1398139345

Reading through the comments, and kind of agree that the project is an interesting representation of hacker culture, and certainly stimulating/ morale-boosting to work on...<p>But on the other hand, I&#x27;m just a little bit sad that some clearly intelligent people have put time toward this problem instead of pressing issues like hunger or violence or any other number of social problems that are present all over the Valley and the US, not to mention the rest of the world. Secondly, every time I read an article about &quot;using the bathroom for 1 less minute will save in total X years of your life!&quot; I think about Wall-E and how much I don&#x27;t care for that level of efficiency.<p>Alright I&#x27;ll get off my box, because I&#x27;m sure this was a harmless and fun post, but this was just an honest statement of what I thought.

In the case of FDR, Ike, Patton, and McArthur, I suspect it was more their mothers than their wives!  Few men have such helpful mothers!<p>Then there is your ""if the relationship is stable"".  Well, yes, and 'effective'!  So, and especially for the huge fraction of men who don't have mothers as helpful as FDR's, how to get such a 'relationship'????!!!!  May I suggest Women 101-102!!!!<p>Otherwise, yup, ""can be a big distraction if you are trying to create something"".  Twelve year old boys, BELIEVE this!<p>Indeed, one of the first lessons in Women 101-102 is:  Since the sixth grade or so, you REALLY wanted the girls to like you, right?  So, you did this and that and it didn't work very well, right?  Well, heavily what the girls want to see in a boy or man is someone strong, capable, and confident who understands the emotions of girls and women and is nice to them.  For a while, being a successful quarterback on the varsity football team can work well.  But, big secret:  What REALLY works well is to be out of school, have a good career going, have plenty of money in your pocket, have a nice car, say, a recent Corvette, have a house bought, and have plenty of money to be able to support a wife and children.  Then a large fraction of the females will, to exaggerate a little, do 'just ANYTHING' to be 'friendly'!  Usually they won't even be able to help themselves!  Uh, that reaction is a 'built-in function'!  With these advantages in place, your brand of aftershave, blue jeans, shoes, cell phone, manner, tone of voice,  pickup lines, even height and weight, etc. won't much matter!  How 'bout that!<p>In particular, largely f'get about females your own age.  Instead, in your teens, go for girls 1-4 years younger than you are.  If she is 13 and you are 16, then she can be REALLY impressed that you have your own car but won't expect you to have a good career or a house yet!<p>Next, as from an expert on females, ""Of COURSE, women are MUCH more emotional than men.  That's the cause of all the problems."".  Yup, not exactly right, but close!  In a 101 level description, what rationalism and logic are for a hacker programming, fixing a car, diagnosing a network problem, etc. emotions are for females.  In simple terms, first-cut, at the level males need to understand starting at age 12, the life of a female is all about emotions.  Even when she is doing math or science, mostly she is seeking good 'emotions' from praise, acceptance, and approval from others she wants to please!<p>That's enough!",1316363809

Don't pick C: it's a fine language, but too low-level for what you want to do. Javascript literacy is a must in web development. So learn it, but not only it.<p>What's more important is that you choose a language that <i>you</i> are comfortable with. You can learn basic Python in a couple of weeks. Is Python a perfect language? No. Is it ""good enough""? Generally, yes. (Switch to Scala if it's too slow or if you find dynamic typing doesn't suit your needs.) Then build a great demo. You're going to get more leverage, in terms of hiring smart people, out of having a great demo than having picked the right language.",1316362559

In France after the Revolution the Metrical or Decimal system of measures was introduced. The fundamental standard adopted was that of a quandrant meridian; This quandrant was divided into ten millions of equal parts, and one parts or divisions was called the Metre, which was adopted as the unit of length and painfully measured by triangulation by M.M. Delambre and Mechain by measuring an arc of the meridian between the parallels of Dunkirk and Barcelona!",1316362503

To be very useful on Windows, really need to be okay on the content of several books, each about 1000 pages long, have worked through about 2500 Web pages of documentation at Microsoft's MSDN, along with more pages from other sources.  Then need to write some code, at least as exercises, using what learned.  For writing code, need to learn either an integrated development environment (IDE), e.g., Visual Studio, or get good with a powerful text editor (I use KEdit) and its macro language (I have about 150 such macros) and a scripting language.  And need to get good with Windows, e.g., have traversed much of the obscure tree of things to click on.  And need to be good at software installation, e.g., .NET Framework, service packs, IIS (for a Web server), Internet Explorer and some other Web browsers, likely some version of Office, maybe Knuth's TeX, SQL Server or some alternative, etc.  Should learn some Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  Should learn some T-SQL, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET.  Also need to be good at backup and recovery, ESPECIALLY of the operating system and boot drive.  A year?

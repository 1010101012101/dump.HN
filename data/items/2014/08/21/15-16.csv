8207968,comment,8207676,8207676,4,0,bellerocky,,,"I recently switched to using gulp and webpack (to build react.js) after having used grunt for many years and I would encourage anyone still using grunt to make the switch. All that pain and suffering to get your grunt build to work will not be a problem. Setting up gulp is painless. It just worked. My setup is less, jshint, wepback with react.js and bootstrap.<p>I encourage people to use webpack for any kind of js building unless you&#x27;re using browserfy, but you can use browserfy with straight up gulp. You could also replace browserfy with webpack. Webpack will build your require.js (and your commonjs) without need for almond.js if you&#x27;re making single builds. Setting up require.js with grunt was a nightmare, and a cinch with gulp + webpack. Like it took me an entire day in the past with grunt, and like 5 minutes with gulp and webpack.",1408636634

8207959,comment,8206700,8207832,6,0,Amezarak,,,">  Do they actually explore the whole &quot;superheroes are bad&quot; theme more? Would I get a better sense of the context for what Dune really was about?<p>Yes. I&#x27;d say the &quot;superheroes are bad&quot; theme doesn&#x27;t even come to its real fruition until <i>God Emperor of Dune</i>, especially as realized through the eyes of Duncan. But even in the context of <i>Dune</i> alone, I think you&#x27;re missing the implications of Paul&#x27;s ascension. In order to revenge himself on the Harkonnens and the Emperor, Paul had to ally himself with the Fremen. And to render the Freman united, effective allies, he had to make himself a religious figure. As a consequence, revealed in his prescient visions in <i>Dune</i>, Paul has unleashed a murderous Fremen-led jihad on the galaxy that will kill tens of billions.<p>Dune Messiah and Children of Dune certainly go more in depth into what is discussed in the article though. This quote from the article particularly brings them to mind:<p><i>This grows from my theory that superheroes are disastrous for humankind. Even if we find a real hero (whatever-or whoever-that may be), eventually fallible mortals take over the power structure that always comes into being around such a leader.</i><p>But if you did not enjoy <i>Dune</i>, I am doubtful you will enjoy the sequels.",1408636551

Yes, yes, yes, I know, there was publicity and/or propaganda of a big <i>ozone hole</i> over the Antarctic, right, in the winter in the Antarctic when there was no sunlight at all.  Semi-, pseudo-, quasi-amazing.  It was presented just as propaganda, not as solid evidence with who measured it, how, when, where, etc. with comparisons with elsewhere, with the Antarctic at other times of the year and in other years, the Arctic, etc.  It was just propaganda.  It wasn&#x27;t much better than the Mayan charlatans claiming that without pouring blood on a rock the sun would stop moving across the sky.<p>&quot;Keep trying&quot;?  Sounds like medicine 500 years ago -- let&#x27;s try some of this sulfur, now some of this broth of boiled rat tails, now some of these leaches.  We&#x27;ve had hundreds of years to know that such mindless, irrational throwing trash against the wall to see what sticks is just wasteful or dangerous and we shouldn&#x27;t do it.<p>Or, if it ain&#x27;t broke, then don&#x27;t fix it, and so far there is no good evidence that anything is broken.  Moreover, even if there is a problem, there&#x27;s still less evidence that humans are the cause.<p>Much stronger evidence is that some manipulators and propagandists can make people feel guilty for no good reason.  It&#x27;s social and psychological, not physical or scientific.  Some good technical people can be a bit eager to believe that there is a genuine problem and a bit slow to see just simple, silly, psychological manipulation.<p>&quot;Consequences of ozone loss&quot;?  Yes, the &quot;consequences&quot; would be bad, but we shouldn&#x27;t worry about such <i>consequences</i> until we have some solid evidence of significant &quot;ozone loss&quot; due to human activity, and so far we don&#x27;t.  There would also be terrible &quot;consequences&quot; if the sun quit shining, but we don&#x27;t try to DO something about that yet.<p>You are acting like someone convinced you that you are a terrible <i>sinner</i>, that you are doing something very wrong, and that you need to sacrifice this and that, whatever, until you are no longer doing something wrong, etc.  As I outlined, that&#x27;s a very old, dirty, destructive, manipulative <i>mind trick</i>.  You&#x27;ve been totally taken in.<p>Instead, it&#x27;s much more likely that you should be concerned about being manipulated by a hidden agenda, that you should follow the money, that you should know that politics is more important than ozone.  It&#x27;s just not about ozone.<p>Warm, sincere advice:  Just gotta be really gullible to believe that this is actually about ozone.  Or, some people want to be on your back and into your pocket.  Not nearly a new story, but one, a scam, that has worked for 1000+ years.<p>Why?  Because people tend to be afraid.  And, when in doubt, still be afraid.  Be afraid of anything that goes &quot;bunp&quot; in the night.  Be afraid of what&#x27;s under the bed.  Be afraid of anything new.  Be afraid that are doing something wrong.  Be afraid when authority figures talk about the sky is falling.  Then, afraid, believe that need to do something, certainly not just do nothing.  So, something, say, what some manipulative propagandist authority figure is saying to do.  Let them be on your back and pick your pocket.  Let them ruin your A/C and, then, sell you new A/C at much higher prices, all for no good reason of science or engineering.<p>It&#x27;s a scam.  It&#x27;s time to call it a scam.",1408636424

The issue is that different &quot;kicks&quot; get absorbed in different ways by the stuff which makes up your cells. One gets absorbed by the chemical bonds and tears them apart; one gets absorbed by the molecule as a whole.<p>I think maybe the best way to give the idea is to contrast a car crash with a bullet at the same energy. According to Wikipedia, a really strong rifle cartridge (in this case, the .220 Swift) fires its bullet with at most 2.4 kJ of kinetic energy, which is about the energy of me moving at 15 mph. So you can imagine me, getting shot, flying backward at ~10 mph. But also there&#x27;s the exact same energy and momentum transfer as is in me falling asleep and veering into a tree while driving at 10 mph. So why do I think that the 10mph crash is survivable as long as I don&#x27;t get thrown from the vehicle, while the bullet would likely be fatal?<p>The difference is that the seat belt distributes the force over most of my upper torso, whereas the rifle distributes all of its kick in a particular place. Similarly, the &quot;smaller&quot; photons distribute all of their kick on particular atoms, while the &quot;bigger&quot; photons tend to distribute their kick on the protein as a whole. One &quot;rips the stuff apart&quot;, the other causes it to bump into its surroundings more.",1408636215

The lottery analogy implies a selector, but it&#x27;s only a model: in reality, this is an autonomous, unselecting, random distribution, and &quot;we&quot; just happen to be in it and able to describe it from within. We had no bearing on whether we were created or not, nor which universes were &#x27;rejected.&#x27; (The &#x27;rejected&#x27; ones surely still exist, with the exception of the fact that perhaps they didn&#x27;t produce an observer to know about them).<p>&quot;We&quot; reject other universes because &quot;we&quot; observe this one, and &quot;we&quot; don&#x27;t observe the others. There may not be others. There could be infinite others. We don&#x27;t know; we know only what we see, and that&#x27;s a universe in which we exist. The trait of observation means only that an observer exists. It&#x27;s a tautology, and does not imply anything else.<p>This is similar to consciousness (another analogy): you appear to be an isolated observer of the world, when in fact there are over 7 billion others, who also are themselves isolated observers of the world. The fact that you can observe your own existence does not mean you are selected or that any selection process took place that resulted in you specifically. Your consciousness came afterward; your ability to understand it even later.<p>Consciousness is, in fact, quite common and ordinary. It carries no meaning other than what it is. Ascribing meaning to the trait of one&#x27;s own consciousness is just a human construct. It is an illusion; a by-product of consciousness itself.<p>As with the universe. The universe which created us is not special. It&#x27;s simply the one in which we find ourselves. &quot;Special&quot; is what we might call that, but only from our (limited, tiny, inconsequential) perspective. In the greater reality, it is simply a thing that happened. Other universes with different parameters may have other sentient beings in them with the same dilemma. They are not selected for either; they simply happen to have conditions which resulted in the evolution of beings who can see and think and feebly understand where they are.<p>The purpose of all this is up to you. The most likely explanation is that there is not a purpose to the conditions from which our consciousness came about. It is likely simply one universe in an infinite number in the unfathomably large and complex—yet simple—reality that is. We may never know what is outside our universe, but that is the reason for its continued study.<p>Or, as good as any:<p>“We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” - Sagan",1408635847

8207814,comment,8206038,8206038,44,0,agentultra,,,"Some practical features I enjoy in CL:<p>1. <i>Conditions and restarts</i>: As far as error handling in programs go this is the most rock-solid system I&#x27;ve encountered. You can tell the system which bits of code, called restarts, are able to handle a given error condition in your code. The nice thing about that is you can choose the appropriate restart based on what you know at a higher-level in the program <i>and continue</i> that computation without losing state and restarting from the beginning. This plays well with well structured programs because the rest of your system can continue running. Watching for conditions and signalling errors to invoke restarts... it&#x27;s really much better than just returning an integer.<p>As a CL programmer using SLIME or any suitable IDE, this error system can throw up a list of <i>appropriate</i> restarts to handle an error it encounters. I can just choose one... or I can zoom through the backtrace, inspect objects, change values in instance slots, recompile code to fix the bug, and choose the &quot;continue&quot; restart... voila the computation continues, my system never stopped doing all of the other tasks it was in the middle of doing, and my original error was fixed and I didn&#x27;t lose anything. That is really one of my favorite features.<p>2. CLOS -- it&#x27;s CL&#x27;s OO system. Completely optional. But it&#x27;s very, very powerful. The notion of &quot;class&quot; is very different than the C++ sense of struct-with-vtable-to-function-pointers-with-implicit-reference-to-this. Specifically I enjoy parametric dispatch to generic functions. C++ has this but only to the implicit first argument, <i>this</i>. Whereas CLOS allows me to dispatch based on the types of all of the arguments. As a benign example:<p><pre><code>    (defclass animal () ())\n    (defclass dog (animal) ())\n\n    (defgeneric make-sound (animal))\n    (defmethod make-sound ((animal animal))\n      (format t &quot;...&quot;))\n    (defmethod make-sound ((dog dog))\n      (format t &quot;Bark!&quot;))\n\n    (make-sound (make-instance &#x27;animal))\n    (make-sound (make-instance &#x27;dog))\n</code></pre>\nWill print &quot;...&quot; and &quot;Bark!&quot; But the trivial example doesn&#x27;t show that I can dispatch based on all of the arguments to a method:<p><pre><code>    (defclass entity () ()) ;; some high-level data about entities in a video game\n    (defclass ship (entity) ()) ;; some ship-specific stuff... you get the idea.\n    (defclass bullet (entity) ())\n\n    ;; ... more code\n\n    (defmethod collide ((player ship) (bullet bullet))) ;; some collision-handling code for those types of entities...\n    (defmethod collide ((player ship) (enemy ship))) ;;; and so on...\n</code></pre>\nConversely...<p><pre><code>    Ship::collide(const Bullet& bullet) {}\n    Ship::collide(const Ship& ship) {}\n</code></pre>\nWhere collide is a virtual function of the Entity class requiring all sub-classes to implement it. In the CLOS system a method is free from the association to a class and is only implemented for anyone who cares about colliding with other things.<p>The super-powerful thing about this though is that... I can redefine the class while the program is running. I can compile a new definition and <i>all</i> of the live instances in my running program will be updated. I don&#x27;t have to stop my game. If I encounter an error in my collision code I can inspect the objects in the stack trace, recompile the new method, and continue without stopping.<p>3. Macros are awesome. They&#x27;re like little mini-compilers and their usefulness is difficult to appreciate but beautiful to behold. For a good example look at [0] where baggers has implemented a Lisp-like language that actually compiles to an OpenGL shader program. Or read Let Over Lambda.<p>One of the most common complaint I hear about macros (and programmable programming languages in general) is that it opens the gate for every developer to build their own personal fiefdom and isolate themselves from other developers: ie -- create their own language that nobody else understands.<p>Examples like baggers&#x27; shader language demonstrate that it&#x27;s not about creating a cambrian explosion of incompatible DSLs... it&#x27;s about taming complexity; taking complex ideas and turning them into smaller, embedded programs. A CL programmer isn&#x27;t satisfied writing their game in one language and then writing their shaders in another language. And then having to learn a third language for hooking them all up and running them. They embody those things using CL itself and leverage the powerful compiler under the floorboards that&#x27;s right at their finger tips.<p>Need to read an alternate syntax from a language that died out decades ago but left no open source compilers about? Write a reader-macro that transforms it into lisp. Write a runtime in lisp to execute it. I&#x27;ve done it for little toy assemblers. It&#x27;s lots of fun.<p>... this has turned into a long post. Sorry. I just miss some of the awesome features CL has when I work in other languages which is most of the time.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z4GfOUWEuA&list=PL2VAYZE_4wRKKr5pJzfYD1w4tKCXARs5y"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z4GfOUWEuA&list=PL2VAYZE_4w...</a>",1408635078

8207798,comment,8203425,8205457,1,0,drostie,,,"It&#x27;s worth understanding that the light which you see is the result of <i>many photons</i> -- though it&#x27;s usually estimated that maybe, if our rod/cone cells were a little more sensitive, they might have been able to perceive individuals. So <i>actual</i> energy/mass transfer comes from a <i>lot</i> of particles each offering their own individual kicks. So the overall intensity is not just (energy per kick) but really (number of kicks) * (energy per kick). The number of kicks counts.<p>Phonons, for sound, actually are quantized in the exact same way as for light -- just replacing the speed of light c with the speed of sound in the medium v. (Both arguments are based on analogies to a harmonic oscillator problem which every quantum mechanics course works out; basically any vibration in the bottom of a potential well X can be dealt with by approximating that potential well with a parabola, which leads to particles, we could call them X-ons, of one form or another. Quantum mechanics makes all particles act like waves but also makes all waves quantize into particles.)<p>So, long-story-short, the physics <i>is</i> the same, and long wavelength phonons <i>also</i> carry less energy per kick than shorter ones, just like photons. That&#x27;s not the difference, and the E = h f equation is still the same. But for phonons it&#x27;s more about numbers.<p>The biggest sound particles you can hear correspond to 20,000 Hz frequencies. The smallest light particles you can see correspond to 700 nm wavelengths or 10^15 Hz frequencies. So photons are more than 50 billion times more energetic than phonons, as a rule.<p>This changes a lot of features about them. For example, every degree of freedom in a system has some average energy due to just random energy-sharing, which is known colloquially as the &quot;temperature&quot; of the system. If you work out how many 20kHz phonons there are simply due to a room being at room temperature, it works out to about 300 million. Any detector which registers 20kHz phonons, including the hairs in your ear, have 300 million of those phonons in them just from random thermal excitation. On the other hand, the red light receptors in your eye have on average (300 million) / (50 billion) = 0.006 photons in them on average, meaning that if you look at a thousand of those photon-absorbers you&#x27;ll see on average only six of them which are excited randomly just by thermal excitations. So we can, at room temperature, detect individual photons, where we can&#x27;t detect even ten thousand phonons at once without it getting hopelessly buried in thermal noise. (But our eyes simply do not fire the neurons when a light-sensitive cell only sees one photon.)",1408634896

It&#x27;s that competition which will push housing prices up to levels that require two middle-class incomes.<p>This includes most major cities. Even excluding bubbles, desirable urban real estate in the US has skyrocketed much faster than inflation. There are a lot of factors in that, but one of them is that the market has now priced in the fact that most homeowners in these areas are now dual income.<p>> So if one wanted to live like in the past it is certainly attainable on a single reasonable income.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s true. Take Houston, for example. Some of the most expensive neighborhoods were originally suburbs in the 1950s filled with workers who commuted downtown. Now those neighborhoods are considered urban and there is an entirely new ring of suburbs beyond them (in fact two such rings). The homes in these now-urban neighborhoods are now all $1M+.<p>A family with a reasonable income of $100k will be completely priced out of all those homes. They&#x27;ll be forced to either live much further out (meaning very long commutes) or to live in an apartment/condo or, maybe, a townhouse. If they had lived in the 50s, they&#x27;d have been living in a neighborhood that is now reserved for surgeons, corporate attorneys, and even CEOs.",1408634682

Red tape no longer exists: laws are conceived of, passed, funded, and executed within hours, rather than months. The bureaucratic machinery becomes a juggernaut, rolling over human concerns and welfare with terrible speed, jerking the universe of sentients one way, then another, threatening to destroy everything in a fit of spastic reactions. In short, the speed of government goes beyond sentient control ... Founded by the mysterious &quot;Five Ears&quot; of unknown species, BuSab began as a terrorist organization whose sole purpose was to frustrate the workings of government in order to give sentients a chance to reflect upon changes and deal with them. Having saved sentiency from its government, BuSab was officially recognized as a necessary check on the power of government. It provides a natural (and lucrative) outlet for society&#x27;s regular crop of troublemakers, who must be countered by society&#x27;s regular crop of &quot;do-gooders&quot;.</i><p>FWIW, I find <i>Dune</i> and many other classics of sci-fi (extended to film, TV and videogames) so compelling because it&#x27;s a solid story built on the foundation of a carefully imagined and visualized universe ... down to the political power structure.

Perl has CPAN, Ruby has Gems, Lisp has ASDF and Quicklisp but Haskell is still stuck with buggy Cabal.<p>I have been in the Cabal hell many times. I know that there are sandboxes, and I considered to install Nix and NixOS just to use Haskell. It surprises me very much that a simple package manager is such a big issue in Haskell. This is a typical example for a real world application that causes strange difficulties in Haskell where other languages have no issues at all.<p>FPcomplete is already working on a new solution with snapshots.

Those last 2 weren&#x27;t completely awful, but they certainly didn&#x27;t live up to the standards set by the original author.  The only point that I was truly disappointed with the writing was when I read the following words: &quot;male bene gesserit&quot;.<p>There were plenty of other inconsistencies as well, but as when watching any good movie, you need to suspend reality (in this case Frank Herbert&#x27;s reality) and allow the story to play out.<p>I don&#x27;t think I have the stomach to read the prequels, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll come back and re-read the series again and again.  Very few authors take the time to create such immersive universes.",1408633484

But another goal is creating compassionate people who care about others while carrying that identity-less feeling with them. And true, one risk is that one would be happy with himself and isolate himself. But those traditions know and try to manage those risks.<p>And i don&#x27;t think this loss of self comes from self introspection, but more from long solitude(which tends to break the psych construct we call ego).<p>And no wonder he like solitude so strongly - he didn&#x27;t find happiness among humans before. Hopefully after he get released , he can find some way to make a living while having the ability to live mostly alone and in nature.",1408633481

It certainly is stretching the bounds of credulity to call it &quot;merely&quot; middle-class, though, and forget calling it &quot;poor.&quot;<p>&quot;Rich&quot; means more than having a relatively high income. It means having the means to obtain in relative short order, or having already obtained, relative financial independence. An income of $100,000 doesn&#x27;t qualify in most places. Such a person would be required to find some income if he loses his current source, and he would almost certainly suffer financially and take many hits to his credit during a period without income. This person isn&#x27;t &quot;rich&quot; until he&#x27;s amassed enough savings that he <i>can</i> weather such a period without significant risk to his finances or credit, which will take literally decades in most cases.",1408633363

Granted, College Park and Hapeville aren&#x27;t necessarily wealthy areas but they are near the airport so that makes sense. I was thinking more of Sandy Springs and Avondale Estates, and to a lesser extent Decatur.<p>Of course, that graphic could have zero to do with their plans and I&#x27;m going on about nothing. I do wish you could check by ZIP code alone instead of needing a street address as well.

If I understand how these are typically implemented, screen-space reflections sample existing parts of the current frame.  These are good for real-time reflections at shallow angles.  Cubemap reflections are for the rest of the environment, when there is nothing &quot;on screen&quot; to sample <i>from</i>, and so you must resort to a pre-baked image of the environment to represent your reflection.",1422403170

However, I think this really overestimates the efficiency of email as a communication method to replace meetings. Personally, I think for the most part phone meetings with occasional screen sharing is usually sufficient but so much either gets lost in email or requires more effort to communicate effectively that I feel like this is more like &quot;I don&#x27;t want to deal with people&quot; than about efficiently completing tasks. Also, I agree with the other person the lunch time thing and after hours thing just kind of makes me sad. If you replace email with phone calls, I mostly agree with it.

In the case of a publicly traded company where the market cap is substantially less than the book value -- concrete assets less concrete liabilities -- there is a judgement that these fuzzy assets and liabilities aggregate to a net liability. That&#x27;s a sign of perceived distress, but not really rare.<p>Its even less rare for a company to be valued less than its (concrete) assets -- this is fairly normal. That just means that the net positive goodwill is less than concrete liabilities.",1422403101
8957047,comment,8954773,8956639,0,0,crpatino,,,"I was kind of half-trolling, but thank you for asking the serious questions.<p>I think it is part of the natural order of things for humans to work and provide for their kin. This certainly include teenagers and senior citizens in good health. The recipients should be first and most obviously children, but also include the elderly and the disabled. Of course if the family is prosperous enough that only a subset of &quot;working age&quot; members can support it, there is no inherent obligation (or prohibition) for all who can work to do so.<p>Also, there is the social custom that if you are prosperous enough, you should extend the same provisions to non-kin. The is a wide degree of variation between being merely a cheap neighbor and being an abhorrent misanthrope, so you have lots of options regarding on how generous you can afford to be (or not to be).<p>Enter the government here. The secular liberal worldview that most people around here would identify with says that you pay taxes in return of the services that you receive from the government (other cultures or life situations dictate that it is your divine duty, or that they kill you if you don&#x27;t, but let&#x27;s not talk about that here).<p>So, the question is... what is the meaning for a government to extract a fee for a person to have the right to be born and raised? Does it mean the government can dictate who has the right to exist? And, by extension, not have such right?<p>Of course, in practice, the government can charge you money for whatever reason they can come up with (my personal favorite is in 19th century Mexico, where they charged on the number of windows your house had... and the people began simply to wall off their windows). It also can expend the money however they see fit. In the particular case of the US, they already give money to people with children, they give food stamps, they give free public education... and all of that money comes from taxes... they just don&#x27;t charge you for &quot;the right to have been born and raised&quot;.<p>Besides, people who object to taxes at least have the freedom to turn into a life style that do not require such payments (even if the personal cost is too high). By example, you are free to not hold a job if you object to income tax. What are you going to do to those that do not pay for having been born? Kill them? Turn them into slaves?<p>I have already mentioned the &quot;natural order&quot; of human existence. And I am aware that not everyone believes there&#x27;s such thing, but still. I think the natural order of Nations is to preserve their people and their culture. And you can only do that by raising newer generations. There are many people in every country that need assistance, and we can debate on the worthiness or unworthiness of each claim... but to deny the claim of the children is exactly the same as eating the seeds for next year sowing. It is the telltale sign of a corrupt society.",1422403100

That said, heated mattress pads on the market now have a finite lifespan.

Almost all firms work off a percentage of the hiring salary with a guarantee or buy back within a 90-120 day window.  Additionally, they are paid a sliding fee if a candidate is hired within the next 12 months after being referred to the company by the recruiter.  The fees are usually around 15-25% of the hiring salary, but I have seen as much as 30% for tough to fill positions.  Also, if you use a recruiter to get a consultant for 3 months then hire that consultant the fee will be reduced by some percentage, usually after 180 days you are free to hire the consultant without any further payments to a recruiter.<p>The fee is paid by the employer to the recruiting firm, the actual recruiters usually make a percentage of that fee.  Their take home is usually a small base salary plus their percentage paid out of the 90 day window.  You&#x27;ll know a good recruiter if you are a candidate because he/she will follow you really closely for 90-180 days to make sure you are happy and sticking with the company until at least after their guarantee window has passed.  This helps them make sure the company is happy and you are so they keep their commission.  Their commission varies, but is usually between 10-35% again partially depending on the difficulty of the position they are filing.<p>So a decent recruiter, that is good at networking and places people intelligently, will make a reasonable salary. Generally around $75k-$150k, with outliers on either side I am sure.  Partners in firms of course will take a higher percentage of each placement.",1422401781

I also had serious issues with the Intel wireless drivers causing blue screens (seems to be fixed now).  The problem is the platform owner, Microsoft, isn&#x27;t responsible for quality control.

The hard part is that the only person who is truly acquainted with the relevant facts is you (and your co-founder, if you are so fortunate).<p>The first time, I was blindsided by the launch of a startup I should have known existed. Despite doing tons of market research, it somehow flew under my radar, and the result was that I ended up wasting months of my time.<p>In that case, deciding not to play catch up to a company with more traction, funding and resources than I had, in a space with very little room for differentiation, was probably the right call to make. It burned, but in hindsight the decision to move on was almost certainly for the better.<p>Using that experience as a catalyst for the idea that followed, the second time there would be no blindsiding. Instead, I became aware of the other startup almost as soon as it came into existence. While not a threat initially, I watched over the course of a year as it became more and more similar to what I was working on, gaining incredible amounts of traction along the way. It felt like my product was dying in slow motion before even being born.<p>The only difference this time, was the particular space allowed for quite a bit of differentiation. While that&#x27;s a good thing, it also makes the questions you have to ask yourself that much harder.<p>After agonizing for quite some time, I came to realize most of my fears were irrational.

I think they have remarkable product focus, and it&#x27;s a testament to how unbalanced business thinking generally is in the spectrum. I think the status quo is a little too far past &quot;the product won&#x27;t sell itself,&quot; and Slack is a good example of a company balanced more toward the quality side of the equation. To me, that&#x27;s the core reason for their success so far, and it&#x27;s surprising that more companies haven&#x27;t dawned on this way of operating (well, not surprising when you consider mainstream American business ideas).<p>It does remain to be seen if they can keep up the solid quality as they grow.

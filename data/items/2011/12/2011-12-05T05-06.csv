If you look at the growth amongst Internet users in India between, say 2009 and estimates for 2011, it resembles the growth amongst Internet users in US in the late 90s. US had 120M Internet users around the time of the Web 1.0 boom.<p>Mobile usage is even higher as you know so it seems like mobile app startups could do really well. If the growth is happening in small towns/rural areas even better, no SV company is going to want to spend time in Gummmidipoondi to understand their target customer.

Last thing any investor wants is to be stalked by someone who they do not believe is ready for funding, but is asking for their money. If you do not have 100% bulletproof answers to all the questions raised in the comments here I would categorize you as ""not ready"" and recommend to use the following Plan B.<p>Instead of pitching and setting a hard marker (e.g. we are raising $X by month Y), say that you are simply focusing on your business (product development / sales) and is just starting to ""explore the possibility"" of raising funding and ""open to advice"" on the best way to approach it. This would put any VC at ease, you'll be able to present your story and if they feel it to be compelling enough, they would want to follow up, buying you more time to prepare. If they are not interested, nothing is lost because you have not been ""pitching"" but merely ""asking for advice"". You'll be able to re-approach them at a later time saying you are ""finally ready"".<p>Above all try to go in confident and relaxed. Be sure to look genuinely interested when ""asking for feedback"", because chances are you could put it to good use if they turn you down. Do not forget to ask for introductions too: ""who do you think we should talk to about this"".<p>If you do not get any real interest, remember nothing is lost.

I would add to that a couple other things:<p>1)  There are a lot of development-related things that I simply want cursory knowledge about right now.  Blog posts, textbooks, and the like are great there.  The way I go about things is to maintain a list of books to buy and buy them on a FIFO basis.  Typically there is about a year lag between when a book goes onto the list and when it comes off and is purchased.<p>I then work through the book read it, etc.  Go on to the next.  The book then goes up on my reference shelf and I can go back to it when I need to.<p>The second group of things I need to learn I have strong knowledge in a related area and really need to work with someone to solve a particular problem.  Niche areas of accounting (I maintain accounting software) is a good example of this.  I bring myself up to a ""conversational"" level of knowledge, then work with a customer's accountant to make sure everything is implemented right.<p>But keep in mind I read about 100 textbooks a year and only a small minority are on IT.

Scaling is similar. If you worry about scaling before you're at scale, you're almost certain to spend most of your effort fixing things that won't actually turn out to be bottlenecks. So, as a few other posters have said, wait until you have scale problems and then address them.<p>A safer variant of this make a copy of your system and hit with with a simulated load. However, it's hard to do this in a usefully realistic way. Usually, you'll be launching at small scale and growing gradually. In such situations, it's best to launch, observe actual traffic patterns, and model your simulated load on that. To recap:<p>1. Build your application, following rule 1 (don't worry about scale).<p>2. Launch.<p>3. Observe your actual traffic, and use it to build a realistic load generator. (Depending on your application, you may be able to simply grab a day's worth of logs and replay them at high speed.)<p>4. Run a copy of your system and hit it with 10x your actual load. See what breaks; fix; repeat.<p>That said, here's one tip that will help a lot. A stateless system is easy to scale -- just run more copies of it. Of course, most interesting systems aren't stateless. But often you can push the state into a database. Then you're writing a stateless server that sits on top of a database. Now your code is easy to scale. You're left with the problem of scaling the database, so: at the outset, choose a database that will scale to your needs. This is nontrivial, but is much easier than scaling your own custom stateful code.",1323063705

Bigger wheels are more efficient on a flat surface by way of less rolling resistance; the bigger wheel creates a smoother tangent with the road surface, and contains more air so deforms less under its weight load.  But when you're climbing, rolling resistance means almost nothing compared to the energy you need to supply to climb the well of gravitation potential.<p>The problem with climbing on a folding bike is frame rigidity.  The geometry required by most folders (long single tubes connected by joints with necessary slop for folding) means that a fair bit of the energy you supply goes into stressing and flexing the frame rather than transmitting into the drive system.  The traditional brazed diamond frame doesn't have that problem.  To make an extreme metaphor, climbing on a folder is a bit like pushing a string, where the energy goes into deforming the nonrigid body instead of moving it.<p>If wheel diameter mattered for climbing, then either skateboards couldn't climb hills or they'd have bigger wheels for doing so.",1323061349

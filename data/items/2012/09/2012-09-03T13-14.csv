4470374,comment,4469885,4469885,8,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"The tone of the article is odd. The introduction is borderline hostile but from the rest of the piece it's clear that here is someone who has not only bought an Android device, but put a bunch of time into it.<p>In terms of the list of must have apps my impression was two fold:<p>On one hand I was pretty underwhelmed. Maybe Charles Stross's primary use cases are different to mine but there seems nothing that impressive on his list. The office software looks nice (though less impressive is the hoop jumping to get it) but I think most people stopped being excited by document editing on the go way before iOS and Android came into being.<p>On the other though, thinking about what I have on my iPad and use, there are some nice little things there but I can't say any of them have changed my life or are indispensable to me.<p>The reality is that the massive bulk of what I do is covered off by the pre-installed apps - browsing, video, reading (where there are solid options on both platforms if you don't like the defaults), maps. Yes I can edit video or mess about with music creation on there, but it's not a great platform for either.<p>Perhaps it's just me but I wonder if the gap between app availability on the two platforms is a bit of a red herring at this point. It feels like we're still trying to work out what tablets are for, and while app evolution will be a big part of that, right now it's a perceived differentiator rather than one that has a major impact on usage.<p>EDIT: Removed a snippy last line on the grounds that it was a cheap and undeserved shot at the OP and his replying politely and ignoring it has made me realise I was being a dick.",1346680761

4470359,comment,4467031,4468102,2,0,kahawe,,,"Why is this sad? It shows we are living in a very service-oriented society where a lot of people will happily let ""experts"" do all sorts of tasks for them that maybe 50 years ago nobody would have imagined spending money on. Also, I think most quality tires nowadays don't puncture or rip that easily anymore, at least not the ones on sale here in Europe so most people hardly ever have to change or fix tires on the spot; and when having to switch to mandatory winter tires, well, then they obviously prefer to pay a little for it. And I doubt you are able to cost-effectively and efficiently balance and mount your own tires on the rims since you are very likely lacking all the (expensive) tools.<p>Generally while not very applicable to tires but you can hardly do any repairs on modern cars anymore anyway. So I think these small tasks just died along with repairs. Nowadays cars are ""black boxes"" and they either drive or you hand the whole thing to someone who will hook it up to a computer and then do magic according to the manufacturer's specifications until that box drives again.",1346680372

4470268,comment,4467653,4470097,1,0,gnosis,,,"Predictions of Linux's doom have also been there since the ancient times of the beginning of Linux.<p>Actually, back then there was much more reason to doomsay, as there really wasn't a desktop to speak of (CDE on Solaris was far more sophisticated than bare X on Linux), no hardware manufacturers even bothered to provide even closed-source drivers for their hardware, hardware support was miniscule, there was no such thing as auto-detection of hardware, web browsers didn't even exist so apart from a handful of applications with pitiful GUIs by today's standards, every user was forced to interact with the system through the shell.  There was no OpenOffice or LibreOffice (ie. no option to use a Word/Excel/PowerPoint alternative on Linux), no web browsers, no desktop environments, no way to configure your system through a GUI.  The list goes on and on.<p>Since those days, Linux has improved by many orders of magnitude.  And it keeps getting better every year.<p>I think most people complaining about Linux these days really don't appreciate how bad and comparatively unusable it was in the old days.  Back then you could not even dream of making any kind of comparison between Linux and Windows or MacOS in terms of ease of use for an average non-technical user.  Now from an average user's perspective, they're all quite similar, with some minor differences on the periphery.<p>Sure, Linux still has some problems, but it's not like the competition is without its own problems.<p>Yes, sometimes a user who bought some obscure peripheral (made by a manufacturer who does not care about Linux compatibility) doesn't bother to check to see if the peripheral was listed as being Linux compatible.  So they may have problems getting it to work.<p>But how do you think the typical Windows user likes using a virus and trojan infested system?  Even Mac users are starting to fall victim to this problem.  Or how do you think a typical Windows user enjoys having to reinstall the operating system every couple of years because it's slowed to a crawl through Windows-bloat?<p><i>""Slashdot comments are full of ""Works-for-me"" replies to real issues with varying levels of ""you are lUser"" for not being able to make it work.""</i><p>Slashdot is not representative of the Linux community as a whole.  And my experience in asking questions of Linux users has been quite different from yours.  Virtually all Linux users I've encountered anywhere, from usenet to web forums to irc to mailing lists, have been exceedingly helpful.  Even on Slashdot, there's quite a lot of help to be found.<p>And what could be more helpful than volunteering to write whole applications, whole operating systems, and even the documentation to go along with them for free?  Countless Linux users have dedicated years and even decades of their life to helping the community by doing this.<p>The mercenary, closed-source culture that dominates in the Windows and Mac worlds is shamefully lacking compared to the vibrant open-source world that thrives in the Linux community.  As a Linux user you are gifted with an entire free operating system, tens of thousands of free applications, hundreds of free device drivers, your choice of free desktops, etc.  In the computer world, is this not the ultimate in generosity?",1346678819

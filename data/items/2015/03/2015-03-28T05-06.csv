It&#x27;s also better than any other alternative that anyone else has come up with so far.<p>Much the same criticism can be applied to representative democracy in general. It sucks but it beats, e.g., the plutocratic cult-of-personality that Russia currently has. And what about Somalia? Rule by warlord?<p>FWIW my jury experience differs from yours. I have been on a number of juries in my life and I wound up with a relatively good opinion of most of my fellow jurors. There was only one juror (out of IIRC about six juries) that, it was immediately obvious, was very close minded and basically unclear as to her civic responsibility. But most of my experience is 15 or 30 years old. Perhaps jurors have gotten dumber since then?",1427522279

Interestingly enough, it may actually be a net gain for the countries where IKEA employs people. Because of their ultra-low tax burden and the fact that the profits mostly have to go back into the business, they are able to pay more employees AND pay their employees more. Those employees in turn pay taxes to support the government.",1427522153

It was established as a money machine by George Friedman and a former Texas Congressman (now out of the picture) who served at one time on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. His being the co-founder along with the presence in the vicinity of numerous retired military people and civilian officials helps explain the selection of Austin as the company’s home.  They hustle; everything they do smacks of a hustle.  They exploit the student interns while playing on their desire to partake of the mysterious and the romantic.  Those they do hire for regular positions get the skimpiest of wages.  Expertise and languages are little valued.  Their hallmark tool is an electronic pair of scissors. One student had spent four years as an interrogator for the U.S. Army in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He served as an employee of a contract firm there. His first assignment as a junior member of the Stratfor team was to prowl around the Rio Grande Valley looking for stuff on the drug cartels; he never had been there before.<p>Stratfor cultivates a mystique of secrecy and insider intelligence because in fact they have little to sell that is exceptional.  They use open sources and communicate with old pals in and around government to get a feel for what’s going on. The Wikileaks material corroborates this, and it provides the further insight that they pay people for information and/or contacts.  Those people include journalists, politicos, the occasional academic and professional tattlers. Sources and clients seem to overlap, i.e. Stratfor plays both ends against the middle. Having been shown a couple of Stratfor reports, I am singularly unimpressed by the supposedly inside information and the quality of the analysis.&quot;<p>Stratfor is just another K-street style retirement house and military industrial money milking machine. There&#x27;s no evidence they produce any more value than say, Foreign Intelligence magazine.  They just charge more for it and claim special abilities no one has seen (and have often been hilariously wrong) Basically the military &quot;intelligence&quot; version of a Gartner Group report.<p>The Soviet Union primarily collapsed because it was a poorly run system. Hell, if you believe the libertarian/Austrians it was practically inevitable it was going to crash. The story that Saint Reagan ran them into an arms race which bankrupted them, or spy agencies toppled them is a form of massive survivorship bias. You could claim that external events could set a match to fuel that&#x27;s already there, but the basic weaknesses that put it teetering on collapse were internal economic and political issues that were wholly self made.<p>If one day North Korea collapses, are you going to claim spy agencies get the credit, or that the basic economic and political system is not sustainable in the long term.",1427521439

9280623,comment,9279326,9279326,0,0,dsacco,,,"Hey Sithu, my name is Dylan. I work at Accuvant, a security firm like Matasano. We work with a lot of the top tech companies and Fortune 500.<p>I sent you an email, and I&#x27;d be happy to answer any of your questions or help you out (no charge). Down the line, if you decide you&#x27;d like to explore a security audit, we can help with that too.<p>For now, I&#x27;ll answer your questions:<p>1. I wrote a basic checklist for startups looking to improve their security. You can find it here: <a href=""http://breakingbits.net/2015/02/28/security-for-startups/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://breakingbits.net/2015/02/28/security-for-startups/</a>. It&#x27;s not comprehensive, but I tried to cover the most common issues I saw with startups. Ryan McGeehan also wrote a wonderful checklist for incident response after something <i>does</i> happen. They&#x27;re two sides of the same coin - preparation and damage control. Check that out here: <a href=""https://medium.com/@magoo/security-breach-101-b0f7897c027c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@magoo/security-breach-101-b0f7897c027c</a>. Your specific company will have more to do for each of these based on the context of your team, product and size.<p>2. It&#x27;s difficult to give a good estimate of cost, and I&#x27;m not trying to be a salesman here. It depends on length and scope of work. Are we doing code review or just blackbox testing? Five days or 10? The entire application attach surface or just a few critical pieces of functionality? Budget about $10,000 for a white label pen test lasting a week, but it could be more or less. I&#x27;m summoning &#x27;tptacek here in the hopes he might have more nuance to contribute to this answer.<p>3. How and when to begin a bug bounty program is similarly variable. I have a lot of experience working with Series A companies, and bug bounties are a personal specialty of mine (I have research directly on the subject). In my opinion, you should not have bug bounties until you have at least one full time security engineer. You don&#x27;t want to pay out a bounty for someone reporting that your cookies lack an HttpOnly flag. On the other hand, server-side request forgery usually warrants a payment. If you have developers who could tell you the difference in those two in terms of both definition and severity without looking it up, you&#x27;re okay to have a bug bounty. If not, don&#x27;t pay people for their reports just yet. (This is personal philosophy from my experience - many people will have different opinions).<p>On the other hand, <i>always</i> have a responsible disclosure program. It is perfectly okay to not reward people for reporting security vulnerabilities. I&#x27;ll repeat this: <i>it is perfectly reasonable to not give out payments for reports.</i> Don&#x27;t let financial rewards enter the program until you have reached a certain level of internal security maturity.<p>And no, there is no standard way to determine severity and payments. Google and Facebook pay a lot for bugs that some companies wouldn&#x27;t even accept. It totally depends. That said, as a general guideline, if a reported bug 1. is valid, 2. compromises users, it&#x27;s worth something.<p>Like I said, I sent you an email. Let me know if you have any questions, I&#x27;d be happy to help you with anything you need to know.",1427521199

For a long time, JSON API was more of a set of guidelines than a strict specification. A lot of our early adopters hated all of the <i>MAY</i>s in the spec (you can see examples of that throughout this thread), so we decided to tighten things up considerably towards the end of last year.<p>That meant trying to eliminate the vast majority of options in the primary spec, and moving all optional features to named extensions that clients could programmatically detect.<p>Of course, significantly tightening up the semantics forced us to grapple with harder problems and pushed some ambiguities into the light of day. RC2 in particular was an attempt to seriously pare down the scope of the main spec, while making the semantics of what was left stricter. Dan (the primary editor) and I spent countless hours discussing various details, and people contributed hundreds and hundreds of (very useful!) comments during this period about various details.<p>RC3 was a smaller delta, but I could easily imagine that one of the changes had a large impact on existing APIs.<p>My overall goal for the project from the beginning was to nail down a full protocol (both the format and the wire protocol) that could be implemented by multiple languages on both sides. Originally, it was created because I was frustrated by the ambiguity of &quot;REST-style API&quot; was during the development of Ember Data.<p>The earliest versions of JSON API didn&#x27;t really nail things down well enough to deliver on that promise, but I hope that the latest versions will be able to.

9280576,comment,9278819,9280541,0,0,jacobolus,,,"GA isn’t really a difference in notation exactly. It’s a difference in model.<p>Anyway, the model is great, and IMO should be taught in high schools. It would reduce a lot of redundant and obnoxiously inconsistent existing models we use instead, and ultimately save students a lot of time.<p>It takes a bit of work to get used to reasoning in GA vs. the standard vector model, or via trigonometry, etc., but there’s a pretty big payoff, I find. Many problems are substantially easier to reason about in GA terms, and many bits of bookkeeping can be avoided compared to the standard approaches.<p>More generally, the study of geometry has in general been systematically deemphasized and devalued over the past 100 years, in favor of analysis. This has IMO caused some serious problems for students’ and scientists’ geometric fluency and reasoning. GA is IMO one way of helping reunify algebraic/analytic with geometric reasoning.<p>By “in the works” he probably means that since David Hestenes has put in a career’s worth of work reintroducing / popularizing the ideas that were mostly ignored after Grassman’s time with the singular exception of Clifford (except in highly technical pure mathematics contexts, and by a few physicists for studying general relativity), and especially in the last 20 years or so since a slightly bigger community has gotten involved, it seems like GA is picking up some steam. Many more people have heard/thought about it today than 10 years ago, there are now a handful of textbooks, etc. In particular some computer graphics / computer vision / robotics folks have found GA very useful to their work.<p>As for why physicists haven’t been champing at the bit.. GA as a model doesn’t allow people to solve any new problems that they couldn’t solve before using existing models, it just makes understanding what’s going on a bit easier. It’s sort of like refactoring all your code: it takes a lot of effort to reframe everything in terms of a new model, and the payoff is mostly for the people who are learning the material for the first time rather than for current professional mathematicians and physicists. Radical changes to low-level models take a long time to propagate through society, or sometimes are altogether impossible (which is why we still use base 10 instead of base 12, why America is stuck with imperial units, why we have a completely hacked together calendar of unequal length months, why we use π as a circle constant instead of either 2π or π/2, why we haven’t normalized English spelling, etc. etc.)",1427519190

My overall point[1] was that writing a macro-extensible macro shouldn&#x27;t <i>require</i> cleverness or new code - it should be in the standard library!

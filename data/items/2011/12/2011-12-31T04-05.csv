They're there to protect you from the silly mistakes we all make when doing normal stuff.<p>Maybe you've created a button that puts some text in an element, but, in some rare cases, due to other events on the page, that element doesn't exist. The user clicks the button, document.getElementById returns null, and a nice error message pops out.<p>In JavaScript, you might discover this after a lot of testing. In DynXML, you would never be able to make that bug in the first place -- you'd get a type error.<p>(JavaScript has the advantage, though, of not being vaporware. As the low-paid undergraduate doing the implementation work on DynXML, this is my fault.)<p>Remember, being able to write a function that converts either a string or an integer to an array is exactly the kind of thing that dynamically typed languages let you do that statically-typed languages don't. If you're not doing that kind of thing, you're better off with a statically-typed language (when available).",1325307533

If someone buys item X from the online store and says they want to pick it up at Store A, the commerce site needs to do several things:<p>1) Check if the item is in stock at Store A, if so, send a message to take it off the shelf to the store -- access to system wide inventory management.
2) If it's not in store A, find the nearest warehouse and route item X to store A. Give the user an estimate shipping time + Alert Store A the incoming item is reserved for the user.
3) Update global inventory lists and decrement one item X from stocks. 
4) Update sales/accounting to let them know of the sale.

3410114,comment,3409751,3409920,0,0,jtc331,,,"""The idea to use undefined behavior for optimization is really terrible. Somehow they forget this is engineering project, not in researching. Breaking existing code costs a lot of time and money.""<p>Saying that using undefined behavior for optimization is really terrible is living in a pipe dream if you code in C at all. No performant C compiler does not use undefined behavior to optimize it's resultant code. In fact, GCC does a fair amount of this too.<p>The real value in using undefined behavior to optimize code is that it leads to a fair amount of layering of optimizations. And the real world tests so a significant improvement in program running speed because of the interaction of optimizations.<p>The real problem is that most C programmers expect far more defined behavior than the standard actually gives. For a long explanation and lots of examples of this, see the series of blog posts at: <a href=""http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_21.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-...</a><p>BTW, breaking existing code happens all the time with new compiler version releases with LLVM or GCC.<p>A side note on GCC: back in school we actually had very simple programs that used only STL data structures (all calls being legal according to the lib specs) that would cause seg faults with certain levels of optimizations in GCC. What's worse: it didn't happen in the previous major X.Y version (i.e. the difference between 4.2 and 4.1.) But even on the breaking build it worked with -O1 but not any higher. That's inconsistent behavior in optimizations if I've ever seen it. But to be fair to the compiler: it's likely that the STL made assumptions that you technically can't make according to the C spec. Just like the OP's code. I love Ruby, but using MRI as an example of code that is a correct program is rather extreme. MRI makes tons of assumptions that often lead to noticeable bugs in the interpreter.",1325304212

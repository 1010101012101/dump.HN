Now I get headaches whenever I&#x27;m in a room with no air circulation (cars with the windows and vents shut are especially bad.) It seems turning my brain on fully requires more oxygen!<p>It&#x27;s surprising, though—almost nobody I&#x27;ve ever asked to open a window or somesuch can <i>tell</i>, even when it&#x27;s pointed out to them, how stuffy the room they&#x27;re in is. (I don&#x27;t even know if I myself used to be able to tell; it&#x27;s a hard thing to remember.) Air quality might be a thing like odor, where you can become inured after spending hours in a room but then it&#x27;s obvious if you spend some time outdoors and then come back. And yet, bad air seems to &quot;hit me&quot; when I enter a room, in a way it doesn&#x27;t to most.<p>Some people, interestingly, get very defensive about the (bad) air quality of a room—even if the weather is perfect outside, and even if they have no allergies or anything similar, they just hate the idea of having a window open. (But, even more interestingly, this seems to be a habitual tic, rather than a physiological desire. One of my friends—who previously kept a horribly stuffy room, and would always ask that I close my own windows because of how &quot;drafty&quot; my apartment is—now keeps his own windows permanently open, after spending just a few weeks at my place.)",1446249197

It&#x27;s a stack-based concatenative array language with a zoomable user interface. Instead of representing code as lines of text, it takes a more Smalltalk-like approach of a live environment. The benefit of being a concatenative language is that it naturally lends itself to a tree-like format where each word can be viewed and edited on a phone screen. Since semantically it&#x27;s closer to a weird mashup of J and Perl(!), it can be concise (hopefully still readable) and the vector aspect makes drawing graphics pretty straightforward.<p>The downside, of course, is that it can be quite hard to reason in. Truthfully, I&#x27;m not really sure how to work around that—and I don&#x27;t think most children will easily think in a function composition/matrix manipulation way. That said, I&#x27;d like to find something since I&#x27;m fairly sold on the idea that tacit programming with arrays is key to making coding on a tablet work (I think it&#x27;s fairly clear that imperative or even conventional function languages would be a royal pain to use in such an environment). Maybe something Lisp-like where the user zooms around the AST would be an alternative.<p>> Poor people in developed countries?<p>Much cheaper phones and tablets are already vastly more popular than laptops or desktops among poor people. The solution is to move coding forward on mobile, not simply keep rather trashy cheap laptops around.",1446248867

You don’t see a lot of capital flow into ordinary consumer and retail businesses.”<p>The statement about professional investors &quot;want[ing] to invest in companies that have the potential to be disruptive to an entire industry&quot; is really not accurate. The vast majority of dollars raised through Regulation D offerings go to financial issuers (investment funds), not &quot;disruptive&quot; startups. Reg D is also commonly used to raise capital for real estate ventures and funds.<p>Although they certainly don&#x27;t constitute the majority of Regulation D offerings, &quot;ordinary consumer and retail businesses&quot; <i>do</i> use private placements to raise capital, but the real reason it&#x27;s more challenging for these businesses to raise capital is not that all professional investors are looking for hundred-baggers. It&#x27;s that they know there&#x27;s a strong likelihood they&#x27;ll never see their capital again at all.<p>This said, I don&#x27;t have a real problem with Title III. The SEC can&#x27;t protect investors from themselves, as evidenced by the fact that investors are still defrauded to the tune of more than a billion dollars a year by penny stock schemes. But it&#x27;s worth observing that the biggest proponents of equity crowdfunding are usually those who stand to profit from facilitating the sale of securities to investors.

After the Startup podcast did an episode endorsing the idea, I wrote a blog post and circulated drafts to friends, but never got around to finishing it. Instead of doing that now, here&#x27;s a rough list of arguments, all of them about how tech startup equity will work out poorly for retail investors:<p>* The core issue: professional startup investors rely on (a) relatively large portfolios where (b) <i>the winners succeed so outlandishly that they pay for the losers</i>. Savvy investors --- most investors aren&#x27;t savvy --- intuitively understand (a), but not (b), and you have to fully grok both concepts to make money from startup equity, because it&#x27;s an equity class that is almost by definition way more risky than normal stock.<p>In particular: the math on &quot;value investing&quot; probably just doesn&#x27;t work with startups.<p>* We have a distorted view of the win/loss ratio of startups, both because so many exits are in fact not net-positive for investors, and because so many startups fail without actually telling anyone (the lights are on, but nobody&#x27;s home).<p>* There&#x27;s probably a market-for-lemons effect bound to apply to equity-crowdfunded startups. Professional investors compete for dealflow. The whole system is designed to route the most lucrative prospects to the pros. There&#x27;s no countervailing force that routes good deals to mom-and-pop investors who can&#x27;t offer anything other than incredibly complicated cap tables to startup operators.<p>* A negotiated event that strikes 25% off the value of a publicly traded company&#x27;s stock is a major news story (and a likely class action suit). But an event that dilutes startup common stock holders down to 50%, 25%, or 10% of their original valuation? Or that wipes it out entirely? In startup parlance, that&#x27;s called Tuesday.<p>* Startups aren&#x27;t like Kickstarter projects. Crucially: people put money into <i>projects</i> on Kickstarter, not <i>teams</i>. Professional startup investors do mostly the opposite. A project page on Kickstarter is a good prospective for a Kickstarter project, but it&#x27;s not even close to a prospectus for a company.<p>Retail investors should get exposure to startups through carefully managed funds that own lots of different startups, not by trying to pick individual winners themselves.",1446247266

What we&#x27;ve done doesn&#x27;t preclude a HKT style in the future, as the signatures are the same.<p>I think many users don&#x27;t know that they want higher-kinded types, only that they want particular features.<p>> I&#x27;m not aware of an imperative language that doesn&#x27;t allow early returns, maybe there are some, but I find &#x27;guard clauses&#x27; to significantly combat rightward drift.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you consider an &quot;imperative language&quot;; I&#x27;d consider Scala an example. I think a decent error mechanism (which Rust does have, even if the implementation is ad-hoc and reliant on a macro) provides a better way to express guard clauses. I think return is untenable in a language with lambdas, because any possible choice of semantics for return inside a lambda (including &quot;compile error&quot;) will confuse a decent proportion of programmers.<p>> Braces are to appeal to our core audience, who have been using braces and semicolons for decades.<p>If by your core audience you mean C++ users then they&#x27;re used to being able to omit braces on if/while/etc.<p>> Other than the laziness, both are &quot;pass a closure.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m objecting to the .iter() part. Or perhaps more generally to the lack of something as extensible as do or for/yield. The for/yield construct turned out to be far more valuable to Scala than was realised initially.<p>> And I&#x27;m not sure how safety ties in here at all.<p>I meant unsafe in the colloquial sense. I think laziness makes programs very hard to reason about.<p>> Most of these things seem like subjective preferences, rather than things that are &quot;completely broken.&quot;<p>I agree that they&#x27;re not completely broken, but I think they&#x27;re more than subjective; in many cases Scala has tried the various options over the years. We&#x27;ve tried exceptions and macros and found a better way of doing error handling. We&#x27;ve had return in the language and discovered it to be more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. We&#x27;ve had a notoriously flexible syntax around function calls and seen a consensus on the best style develop over the years.

Not to pick on you but the scenario you (optimistically IMO) describe is that, on a test basis, under certain limited circumstances and locations, might be able to have fully autonomous vehicles. (Though if they&#x27;re that limited, why would they be legally allowed on the streets?)<p>And highways actually seem like a more likely nearish-term scenario given that, aside from the occasional deer/moose, debris, and construction (which could presumably be dealt with in various ways) seems far more manageable than the typical city street.",1446247143

We were not able to define and measure genetic distances in the past, but now with the ability to read whole genomes, we can do just that.<p>How similar?<p>Consider the following: imagine that you assembled a gathering of all your ancestors in the male line for say, the past two million years. Let&#x27;s say, for illustrative purposes, that the gap between each generation is twenty years. So you&#x27;d have 5 people to represent a century - you, your father, your grandfather, your great-grandfather, and your great-great grandfather. That makes 50 people per millennium, 500 people per ten thousand years, 5,000 people per hundred thousand years, and 50,000 people per million years. So two million years of ancestry gets you 100,000 people, the size of a small city, or about enough people to fit in the Rose Bowl stadium.<p>So really, not that many people in the grand scheme of things. Now line all those people up in order going all the way back to the first guy, who we&#x27;ll just call Adam. The difference between Adam N and Adam N+1 is very small. There&#x27;s no point at which you can say &quot;Adam N is this species and Adam N+1 is that other species.&quot; But there&#x27;s a hell of difference between you and Adam.<p>The same logic applies to life in general, the tree is just a lot bigger and messier and we&#x27;re talking about distant cousins rather than ancestors, and some lines are extinct.<p>But going back to your proposed definition - similar genotype - we can have all kinds of bizarre situations. Say we require the genotype to be 99% similar. By this definition, we conclude that Adam M and N are the same species. We also come to the conclusion that Adam N and Adam O are the same species. But wait! Adam M and O are only 98% similar! What do we do - assign multiple species labels to the same individuals?<p><i>Species</i> has proven a necessary and useful abstraction, but it nevertheless doesn&#x27;t hold up well under scrutiny. That&#x27;s fine, as long as we recognize its limitations.<p>> Then they are obviously not hugely different. Were we just comparing phenotypes when we decided to classify them as different species? Let&#x27;s improve on that.<p>Genotypes certainly provide useful information, but they can also muddy the waters.<p>Assume that we take the definition of &quot;any two organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring are the same species&quot; as our preferred definition. (This has its own problems: for example, did you know mules sometimes <i>are</i> fertile, just not usually? Did you know it&#x27;s <i>conceivable</i> that humans and chimpanzees can interbreed?) It is <i>entirely possible</i> for A and B to be distantly related genetically, yet able to interbreed, while A and C are closely related and unable to interbreed. &quot;Can interbreed&quot; is not necessarily a proxy for genetic distance.",1446247051

By using paper in between the hand and anus when wiping you are attempting to avoid cross contamination with the hands, which is a part of the body that is understood to be much cleaner.  Simply avoiding contact between the two areas is the most direct route to maintain this distinction.  Washing your hands with <i>soap</i> and water after wiping serves as a further action to maintain the usefulness of the hands.<p>You will notice that I highlighted soap above, I do this because I believe it is the key factor often missed in discussions like this.

So the best advice I can give is: if you are developing modules for developers to use in their applications, you&#x27;ll want to primarily target v4 for now but keep an eye on where v5 is going and use that as your beta channel for new development going forward.",1446246365

Often poetry will do this by not saying what is actually happening or the thought it intends to create in the reader.<p>A program is written to perform math, and it is generally considered bad to waste space with needless things. It doesn&#x27;t aid the reader or the compiler or the execution to add unused variables. It&#x27;s really bad in a program to do things in an unclear way.<p>Poetry can have ambiguities, good software can&#x27;t.<p>They do both share some amount of necessity of context. Both often have abstraction. I would say poetry is kind of a playful use of language, whereas programming is really more of a clever use of math.",1446246219

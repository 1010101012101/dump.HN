2178937,comment,2176264,2177450,0,0,banksyw,,,"With respect I think you have missed the point a little. The thing this idea solves is separating data-fetching optimisation from code layout. Regardless of whether you use MVC or entirely procedural code, it gets very hard to keep data access optimal when you have very complex and highly modular pages without introducing hacky globals or coupling unrelated parts of the code together (should be obvious why that's bad).<p>For any one page you may be able to change the structure so that it is more efficient without compromising the code too much but some of those modules will need to be reused in a completely different context on a different page.<p>I'm perhaps not explaining very well but this idea isn't solving deficiencies with MVC, it is solving a problem inherent in ANY attempt to modularise/re-use code. To gain the same data-access efficiency without MVC would leave your code unreadable not to mention un-maintanable with a complex site and high frequency changes.<p>Many sites simply don't need this so yes it would be overkill and of little benefit for them. I don't think the article was suggesting such a scheme would work well for everyone else. If you do have pages which legitimately need to make hundreds of queries/cache gets to resolve the data requirements though, techniques like this can help a lot.",1296813161

This data is to some extent a new creation, although definitely derived from the Google results. Custom analysis of such user activity doesn't necessarily just port over results, but could also result in an even better ranking than the original Google presentation.<p>Fox also suggests there could be a robots.txt-like standard where sites declare they want to opt their users' activity out of any such analysis.

Say I had nothing but this user data - and say I had enough of a sample.  I could build a pretty damn good search engine out of that.  But I know nothing about how to provide search results.

What matters is that it is still relying on someone else's knowledge to improve Bing's product.  That's shitty.<p>This argument clinches it for me.<p>The fact that Bing can't even acknowledge the opposing side - given that at the very least intuitions are going both ways here - is a clear sign of bad faith to me.",1296812810

It has strict Unicode standard UTF-8 parsing (""passes"" <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-test.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-test.txt</a>) and has a whiz-bang LRU cache with a clever aging replacement policy that saves lots of time by reusing already seen and instantiated immutable objects (think JSON dictionaries: the keys in ""key"": value pairs tend to repeat an awful lot).  A further benefit is this saves lots of memory too.  For converting JSON to 'native' ObjC/Foundation objects, it's faster than the other ObjC JSON libraries by 2-10x (HEAVILY dependent on the JSON being parsed, typical is 2-4x), and serializing ObjC -> JSON is (usually) even faster.<p>So, in short, it's possible to write a very high performance JSON serializer and deserializer in ObjC in ~2K lines of code.  For JSONKit, most it is actually pure C (which in turn uses Core Foundation, which is a pure C API interface version for the equivalent native ObjC objects), with public API ObjC stub bindings making use of the C code.",1296812055

People seem to be willing to click <i>something</i> in order for a video to start playing, regardless of what the app in question is doing.<p>It's Audio that is the killer oversight.  Just like Video, Audio can only be played on iOS Safari as the result of a user click.  They don't have to click the play button specifically, but they have to click <i>something</i>.<p>That means you simply can't write a video game that has sound.  Every clip needs to be ""prepared"" with a user action that you convert behind the scenes to a .load() so that it can .play() when you want it to.  And if you ""prepare"" a different clip, you can no longer play the first one, except as the result of a new user interaction.<p>Add to that the bonus that you can only play one clip at a time.  And that iOS tosses them out of memory every time you load a new one, and suddenly your rich, interactive presentation, game, or whatever is reduced to a boggy buffering-screen-having mess.<p>I wish we could hope for them to fix it in future versions, but the opposite is the case in practice.  Up until iOS 4.2.1, there was a nice workaround that got your audio/video clips playing in some cases.  iOS 4.2.1 specifically addressed that loophole.",1296811964

Creating new threads may not be as expensive as you seem to think, -on a standard desktop computer you get between 5000-1000 executed events per second, which is probably sufficient for most situations. This use of multi-threading is used to achieve full asynchronisity. The opposite, as you are implying, is to execute the events sequentially, within the same thread. I apprechiate that you would sometimes prefer the latter, but this can in fact be very easily achieved by using a fixed size thread pool, and adjusting its size to your preferences. Setting the size to one, would ensure sequencial execution of all events. Maybe I should include a threadpool in the next version, allowing its size to be specified.",1296811607

Some 'billiant' ideas are quite clearly rubbish when you remember them again the next morning.<p>For the ones that seem feasible, I do a one-page business plan. How would this work, how would it make money, would it be profitable, are there any awesome features I need to write down while I think of them. This gets it out of my head and onto a piece of paper. The paper goes into a folder, and I don't allow myself to think of them again.<p>From time to time (normally when I get one of them stuck in my head once more, good ideas are like viruses) I review that folder.

Energy is a combination of excitement (where the new ideas have an advantage) and revenue likelihood (Money is energy). I'm in an income phase at the moment (having recently moved my coaching business to the UK), and the income potential of my current business is far greater in the short term than any of those other ideas. So current business wins my energy, and if I really need to validate that in a thinking space I can.<p>Once I have a coaching income base once more, I will likely repeat that exercise and see if I can take on one of the others. By giving myself permission to have great ideas, and a process to nurture them based on my priorities, I manage to stay more focussed on the business at hand.

2178878,comment,2174538,2174538,0,0,_mql,,,"A major problem with RDF is that it is almost impossible to build applications on top of it. You'd need another layer of abstraction to handle the complexity.<p>I really like the approach Freebase takes. It’s a proprietary format, basically. They use JSON rather than XML and they have their own query language MQL (also expressed using JSON). However their graph of entities maps to RDF as well, so they use RDF (along with common ontologies) as an export format. I think while their system is still complex under the hood, it’s less verbose, less scientific, and more user-friendly w.r.t. the public interface. And most important, thanks to MQL it's super easy to build applications on top of it.<p>---<p>For me modeling data as a graph (as RDF proposes) is a really great idea! What I always wanted to do is building client applications (single-page web apps) that can operate on a graph of data directly (instead of talking to a REST service). That's why I'm putting efforts in the creation of Data.js, which features a Data.Graph that can be manipulated in JavaScript environments (like the browser or Node.js). Such Data.Graphs can be persisted (synced) at any time. There's support for CouchDB as a backend.<p>Well, in the README I also pointed out why I decided not to use RDF and instead took inspiration from the Metaweb Object Model (that Freebase uses).<p><a href=""https://github.com/michael/data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/michael/data</a><p>I'd enjoy some feedback btw. The lib is actually working, but the examples are out of date. Have a look at the source or ping me if you want to try it out.",1296810669

2178876,comment,2175091,2175474,0,0,DrHeisenberg,,,"First of all, thank you for your thoughts on my project. As Pohl points out, the anonymous handler-implementations are chosen by design, and are in my opinion very well suited for these types of situations. But I'm thinking maybe you're not bothered by the anonymous implementations, but by the fact that classes like the Event-interface and the GenericEventHandler classes are made as public inner classes within the EventManager class? My thought was that, as they are so tightly coupled to the use of the EventManager class, they might as well be defined inside the EventManager as inner classes. However, if you have any reasons for why they should be defined elsewhere, I'd apprechiate your opinions.<p>As to your concerns regarding the static use of the EventManger, I can apprechiate your point of view. I'll put it on my todo-list for the next version.",1296810628

I headed to the office to see what the call about and it was a local ISP begging me to come in and work for a week. All of their techs were sick and they learned of me via one of the techs.<p>I did tech support with them for a week and ended up taking on a web site project as well. A couple weeks later came another project... and another... and then then two years later we had a good laugh when we realized that they never hired me officially.<p>My first real programming gig came out of the blue as well. I had just graduated high school in North Carolina and received an e-mail from a startup in California. They had learned about me from my work on Gaim (now Pidgin) and wanted to hire me.<p>Two weeks later I was driving across the country to start the job. I don't even think there was an interview involved. I almost half expected to get there and find an abandoned building.<p>That was many years ago.

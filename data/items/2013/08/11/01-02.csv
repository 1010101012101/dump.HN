The cost of encrypt/decrypt would be modular exponentiation which isn&#x27;t that bad.  My point is though that as long as there is some number of bits where RSA is secure and it&#x27;s use is practical then RSA isn&#x27;t dead.  A lot of the discussion seems to imply RSA will be dead soon as a result of recent work.  Maybe it will or maybe it won&#x27;t but it seems the claims are a bit overblown.

Forcing them to hide their now illegal sleeping arrangements is not going to make them disappear or make the problems that come with a thoroughly disenfranchised population disappear.<p>The only thing this accomplishes is putting more of the burden on the poorest people in the community. Now, those people who formerly had a reasonably safe place to park overnight to sleep will have to find a new place to sleep every night. They won&#x27;t be able to build any sort of community bonds with their neighbors, develop a routine (that might be necessary for recovery from addiction, or getting a job, or getting a kid to school every day, or any number of things that requires one to know where you&#x27;re going to be sleeping each night).<p>I&#x27;ve been among the wealthy mobile homeless for five years now (I live in a motor home, and traveled almost non-stop for four years; lately I travel only ~3 months out of the year, but will return to traveling more as I recover from some personal grief that&#x27;s led me to need some stable friendships and a predictable life for a while). I&#x27;ve met a whole lot of folks who live in their vehicle, whether it&#x27;s an old motorhome, a van, or even a car, including in Palo Alto (where I parked for three weeks while visiting friends). This kind of law criminalizes people who shouldn&#x27;t be criminalized, and it makes crime part of the daily lives of people who are just trying to get by.<p>The problem here is that this is using a violent solution to a community problem. When you ask for a law to be made against an activity someone does, you&#x27;re using violence and imprisonment to get your way. That&#x27;s what the state is: Legalized violence. Is it right to find someone so far down on their luck that they are living in a <i>car</i>, and respond by sending men with guns to fine them or arrest them?<p>Because that&#x27;s what this means. The poorest people in Palo Alto will now be subject to being ticketed or arrested for <i>sleeping</i>. Not because they want to hurt anyone, but because they have no where else to sleep.",1376185639
6193444,comment,6186569,6192227,2,0,rdl,,,"I find a flashlight and OC spray incredibly useful, and very rarely (in the US) would ever carry a ccw handgun or rifle/shotgun without a light (mounted to weapon or for use in hand) and also pepper spray.  And a knife, which is incidentally a retention tool for the firearm, but mainly utility (except when I had my overt body armor, where I carried a large fixed blade near to on-vest pistol).<p>Without a non-lethal option, you&#x27;re stuck.  There are situations which don&#x27;t warrant a lethal response, or which don&#x27;t absolutely require a lethal response, but where if you get close, weapon retention becomes a serious issue, turning the whole thing into a lethal force justified encounter.  Which is a huge problem for police who open carry handguns; less of an issue if you CCW.<p>Tasers are huge, and unless openly carried or in a house, are basically the same form factor as a handgun.  If I were a high-risk person (smaller, female, disabled, etc.) in a place where I couldn&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t carry a handgun, it would be an option.

First of all, the notion that everything could be written using just procedure calls (we will not talk about Lambda Calculus here) few special forms and list notation, which goes back to John McCarthy is the great one, and Scheme, therefore, is a result of polishing this idea.<p>Second very important idea related to the first - all the fundamental ideas and techniques in programming one should learn and internalize, could be easily and elegantly expressed in Scheme. This is why it was a language of choice for teaching CS. Even if it lacks some features, such as advanced module system or OO capabilities, but they teach you how easily it could be implemented, and that it is of second importance.<p>So, if I am promoting something here it is these realizations from Brian Harvey, and for me Clojure is something very opposite, a mess and hype and unjustified rhetoric, claiming that it is superior to something much more great and profound.<p>And it is not an empty pose.

The author makes a vast leap of logic from &quot;We are researching organ printing, and we have 3D printers&quot; to &quot;We will soon be able to code DNA and print cells&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a few problems here. One is that &quot;organ printing&quot; in its current state is not at all the same as printing a cell. What would printing a cell even mean? We know how do things like create a cell&#x27;s membrane and inject DNA into it, but as far as I&#x27;m aware nobody can print a ribosome (one of the pieces that converts DNA&#x27;s &quot;code&quot; into proteins).<p>Secondly, it&#x27;s important to know that DNA isn&#x27;t even the assembly language of the cell, it&#x27;s the ones and zeros. The idea of hand-coding DNA is simply absurd -- not because we can&#x27;t synthesize the molecule, but because chromosomes are <i>huge</i> and we don&#x27;t even fully understand what everything does yet. Imagine trying to read a program&#x27;s binary, except some sections of the code are repeated, some are complete garbage, and some look a lot like garbage but are actually totally necessary. Now imagine writing that.<p>There&#x27;s been some work done on genetic computation, using the the expression of fluorescent proteins as &quot;output&quot;, but it&#x27;s a long way from general computation. The idea of a &quot;DNA compiler&quot; isn&#x27;t even possible yet -- noone has figured out how to represent XOR, which makes performing arbitrary computations tricky at best.

Very Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes type stuff.<p>But, I can remember trying projects with tableless design at that point, and absolutely beating my head against a brick wall attempting things in CSS that required almost zero thought with tables. Then, I&#x27;d finally get it right in one browser only to find that it looked like garbage in another.<p>It was like having a toolbox with a hammer that I couldn&#x27;t use, instead being forced to nail everything with a screwdriver.

When you think about it, layout is nearly always grid-like.<p>So, I confess that there were times when I said screw it and reverted to tables. I&#x27;d solve problems that weren&#x27;t working after hours of trying with CSS in literally minutes.<p>And the challenge with CSS is still apparent. Here we are all of these years later, still trying to do something as simple and frequently necessary as center things vertically which, BTW, doesn&#x27;t work in my stock Android browser.<p>CSS is a bloated, convoluted mess and just too much work for simple things. That&#x27;s why I have always found it somewhat draconian that people insisted on CSS as if it didn&#x27;t have its own significant issues. If there were a tag that operated just like tables, but indicated layout or, as I think someone else suggested, a simple attribute to mark a table as layout vs row/column data, most of the semantic/SEO problems could be solved.<p>For that matter, I am not convinced that we should be so bent on having html pull double duty as the source for semantic data <i>and</i> the source for a presentation engine&#x27;s rendering.

The purpose of the ordinance was to preserve and maintain single-family living areas of predominately single-story character. The maximum building height in the &quot;S&quot; district is limited to 17 feet and a limit of one habitable floor. &quot;<p>Basically, to protect the view we need to not have affordable housing.

Were the open source OS with opinionated design. Thats what makes elementary so good. We trim the fat. We optimize. We organize. We rethink.</i><p>That&#x27;s an attitude that&#x27;s sorely missing in the Linux community. elementary is tackling hard problems and succeeding.<p>I look forward to the the success of elementary OS.<p>[0] <a href=""http://elementaryos.org/journal/we-moved-cheese"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elementaryos.org/journal/we-moved-cheese</a>",1376184085

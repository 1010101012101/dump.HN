The art of the Educationalizer is to expand (c) into a mass of pretentious nonsense, fogged by technical terms and psychological twaddle. To do research in Educationalization is to forget about (a) and (b) and make the mastery of (c) seem practically impossible. Those who can, do (it has been said), and those who cannot will teach teachers how to teach other teachers the art of teaching.

The USSR was a vast, vast country, spanning 11 timezones horizontally as the Russian Federation does now.  It contained 15 ethnically and culturally diverse republics, practically every far-northern, tundra, sub-tropical and tropical climactic region imaginable, and manifold examples of every kind of landscape and topography.  In addition, travel to the Eastern European socialist republics was quite possible and routine for many people.<p>My point is, there was a lot to see inside the country.  Were we technically ""trapped"" there?  Absolutely.  But to grok the actual significance of this, consider the single-digit percentage of Americans that hold foreign passports.  Vanishingly few Americans have ever traveled outside the country, and a non-trivial number have never left their state or been beyond a neighbouring one.<p>So, while the fact that the borders were closed is important, and if that's your sole point, well, sure, but if you're likening it <i>experientially</i> to a prison, I think that's a little over the top.  There were certain people who really wanted to leave and for whom that was undoubtably true.  But as with most Americans, most Soviets were somewhere in the middle on that.<p>This is not an apologia or a whitewashing of the fact that our borders were closed, but an attempt to convey the human factor in a more nuanced, perceptive way.",1290295286

He did explicitly say that seniority matters and that the difference peters out mostly after ~5 years (he put a graph on the screen with sources).  He mentioned other metrics should be applied <i>as well</i>, but did not specify exactly what the metrics should be  (whereas this article concentrates on test scores as if he presented that as the only valid metric).<p>Gates minor conclusion is the reasonable one... seniority does matter, but not as much after a certain period of time, therefore it cannot be used as the <i>only</i> method of assessment.  Furthermore, seniority is a rather indirect measure of competence.  I don't see the opposing view as being arguable with a clear conscience, frankly.<p>And, in fact, if you listen to the speech, he does <i>not</i> state budgets as a priority -- yes, an obstacle to be overcome, but not the focus.

1925647,comment,1924944,1925549,0,0,dfox,,,"You almost never have USB link that directly connects two devices (host to function in USB parlance) except in case of PTP (""direct printing""). Any normal tree of USB links (""bus"") contains some hubs in it, which have to understand your alternative protocol. And mayor reason why everybody uses USB is that there is large pool of silicon implementations of almost anything and well tested soft-IP so you don't have to spend large amounts of money on developing hardware dedicated to connecting two devices together, this essentially precludes anyone sane from coming up with some USB-like-but-not-quite-USB interface with same connectors. Actually, completely opposite thing happens now: many companies use completely standard high-speed interfaces (USB, PCIe...) on proprietary connectors (original XBox's controllers and memory cards, IBM/Lenovo's UltraPort/Bay, expansion ports of various mobile devices...) or with slightly stricter tolerances (to make it slightly cheaper, e.g. Intel's Direct Media Interface, which is essentially PCIe with less noise imunity).",1290294433

Please do not argue that I&#x27;m being unfair unless you are.<p>If you think it makes sense, and I&#x27;m misreading, then I&#x27;d challenge you to pick a paragraph, dig into each sentence, and try to explain to yourself what it means; and how the sum of the sentences in the paragraph communicates an idea. It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just a string of generated statements. If you haven&#x27;t seen this kind of material before, then I&#x27;d encourage you to check out papers generated by SciGen:<p><a href=""http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/rooter.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/rooter.pdf</a> (generated nonsense intended to fool the reader - it was even accepted by a journal for publication!)<p>You will probably be able to identify this content for what it is after reading other (well-done) machine-generated content.<p>I&#x27;m qualified to comment on the content. The paragraphs do not make sense. You&#x27;re being taken in by a troll. If anyone wants to seriously discuss this content, start by trying to understanding how &quot;load balancing [...] may actually induces [sic] vulnerabilities to DDOS&quot;, and how that connects in any way to the topic which is cryptography.<p>> Irreversible destruction of the hardware [...] atomic decay processes which are incited by zeta normalization of the attack timing.<p>When is &quot;destruction of the hardware&quot; ever reversible? How will an Internet attack incite atomic decay? (That&#x27;s ridiculous.)<p>The words and phrases are strung together in a way that communicates no cogent idea. They&#x27;re far enough away from making real sense that they can&#x27;t actually be rebutted or discussed in a direct way. All you&#x27;re left with being able to say is, &quot;That doesn&#x27;t make sense&quot;, &quot;Those concepts have nothing to do with each other&quot;, &quot;The ideas don&#x27;t follow&quot;.<p>Try to take the paper I linked above and, selecting any paragraph, attempt to assess the accuracy of its claims, discuss what it&#x27;s saying, or rebut the claims. Example:<p>> Any unproven synthesis of introspective methodologies will
clearly require that the well-known reliable algorithm for the investigation of randomized algorithms by Zheng is in Co-NP; our application is no different<p>Does that look like obvious nonsense to you? It&#x27;s written in a way to <i>appear</i> meaningful but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just randomly generated content using statistical techniques to select words and phrases that appear nearby in a corpus of real content. Nevertheless I&#x27;m sure you can pull some kind of meaning out of that and argue about it. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;d be doing by discussing this user&#x27;s posts.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be mean. I thought the original posts were an interesting, clever performance with better generated material than I&#x27;d seen before. That&#x27;s misleading in the way that a magician is misleading. It can be fun. The subsequent replies appearing to seriously defend the content (which by the way are not at all convincing), and attack users who pointed out its nature, are something different.<p>I really don&#x27;t want to contribute to trolling on HN by discussing this content further, but since you&#x27;re accusing me of being unfairly dismissive: I will be glad to read and critique a short essay about how &quot;load balancing [...] may actually induces [sic] vulnerabilities to DDOS [...] whether or not the maintenance occurs regularly&quot; and how that relates to cryptography. All I can say now is that that claim doesn&#x27;t make sense on its own, or the context of the paragraph, and has no apparent connection to the topic. If the sentence was expanded into several paragraphs justifying its claims and elucidating the topic, then we&#x27;d actually be able to discuss it.",1439675986

They&#x27;re using the California act because a private party can bring an action under that act.<p>&quot;One serving of Soylent 1.5 can expose a consumer to a concentration of lead that is 12 to 25 times above California&#x27;s Safe Harbor level.&quot;  That would mean 12 * 15 micrograms per day. Soylent&#x27;s suggested serving size is 0.5 liter, so that would be a lead level of 90 micrograms / liter.  The EPA&#x27;s action level for lead in water is 15 micrograms / liter.  So they&#x27;re 6x over the allowed maximum level for water.  (That&#x27;s the maximum level allowed for water; the desired level, according to the EPA, is zero.)<p>On the other hand, heavy metal levels are routinely higher in foodstuffs than in water, because plants and animals concentrate them. It gets worse as you go up the food chain; mercury in shark and swordfish is a real issue.  The EU and WHO allow a level of provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 25μg/kg body weight.  US male mean body weight is about 85kg, so that would be 2125μg/kg/week, or 101μg/kg/serving, or about 200 micrograms/liter (1 liter water masses 1kg, so assume that density).  So Soylent, at 90 micrograms/liter, is about half the usual limit. That&#x27;s pushing it, though; a small person drinking four servings a day of the stuff could go over the limit.<p>Because Soylent wants to be the only dietary component, they need pharmaceutical grade quality control.  They should be running a sample of every batch through a mass spectrometer, and testing their raw materials.  Given their emphasis on how &quot;online&quot; and &quot;digital&quot; they are, you ought to be able to view the analysis for your batch on line.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.asyousow.org//?s=soylent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asyousow.org//?s=soylent</a>

You can power-cycle your laptop&#x27;s WiFi every few hours; you can&#x27;t lose the lead singer in a musical or the pastor in a church service. There are digital, frequency-agile wireless systems like ULX-D [2] which are a little better at dealing with crowded RF landscapes, but this is still low-middle tier. UHF-R is a tier above that, starting around $2000 per system. The gear for really challenging RF environments is Shure Axient, and you can&#x27;t even get pricing on that without talking to a high-end certified distributor, but anecdotally the transmitters are about $3,000 and a dual-channel receiver is $7,500.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATW-3131BD-Wireless-Lavalier-System/dp/B003R6V5QM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439674281&sr=8-1&keywords=audio-technica+300"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATW-3131BD-Wireless-Lav...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Shure-ULXD24-B87A-G50-Handheld/dp/B008BMHAKC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1439674532&sr=8-4&keywords=shure+ulx-d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Shure-ULXD24-B87A-G50-Handheld/dp/B008...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.shure.com/americas/products/wireless-systems/uhfr-systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shure.com/americas/products/wireless-systems/uhfr...</a><p>It&#x27;s tempting to think of the problems in fields other than your own as trivial, but please don&#x27;t fall into that trap.

There were the things I &quot;couldn&#x27;t do&quot; on the Sabbath that I really would have liked to do, but I always kept the Sabbath faithfully as a child.  It seemed like a limiting restriction, but I did it anyway.  After I graduated and entered the workforce, I started to appreciate the Sabbath more--probably for the same reasons that many commenters here recognize some of the positive aspects of the idea.  It&#x27;s a nice break from the normal routine, a chance to rest, rejuvenate, etc.<p>But now I do not keep the Sabbath any more.  Somewhere along the line I rejected enough of religion that I didn&#x27;t feel it was necessary even though I recognize the positive aspects of it.  Now I work on Sabbath sometimes.  I do side programming projects on Sabbath sometimes.  I rest on Sabbath sometimes.  Sometimes I rest, relax, and rejuvenate all weekend.  I don&#x27;t feel its necessary to take good guiding principles and observe them as strictly as Sabbath keepers seem wont to do.<p>But maybe that&#x27;s just because of my personality.  Maybe there are people who need a strict Sabbath to prevent themselves from overwork and burnout.  I have a pretty high level of intrinsic motivation and drive myself harder than many, but I have a good internal burnout avoidance mechanism.  I&#x27;m sure there are people out there who don&#x27;t have that and for whom a device like the Sabbath might be very important.  At the end of the day, I think there are very few absolutes, and I find that my life is happier when I&#x27;m not worrying about the Sabbath.",1439674032

It&#x27;s just not a very good best, kind of an admission of defeat.

The vast majority seem to want an increase on this capacity for pretty much obvious reasons. However, some relatively newcomer bitcoin developers argue that increasing it will affect decentralisation, and everyone should use a hubs and spoke system instead. Others argue that as the number of users increases, the number of the blockchain applications increase, the number of nodes and miners increases, thus decentralisation increases. In regards to lightning it is still vapourwear, it requires hot wallets - something which has caused many problems - the hubs are likely to be centralised - and fundamentally users should have a choice.

10066938,comment,10065243,10065607,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"It is interesting to read some of these accounts.  We have several hundred clients who sell on Amazon.  I can probably say we hear horror stories on a daily basis.<p>If I were to summarize the stories and reach a conclusion it would be that Amazon (retail side) exists as a set of silos characterized by incompetence mixed with a solid dose of indifference and total lack of consideration for sellers.<p>I&#x27;ve seen sellers damaged to the point where they lost everything.  Business, home, cars, everything.  Why?  Well, in the one case I can think of we heard from this seller who had been doing millions of dollars per year on Amazon for about four years.  One morning he wakes up to an email from Amazon telling him that his &quot;Selling privileges have been revoked permanently&quot;.  And, in the true style of a lot of large internet companies there was no way to engage with someone at Amazon to try to solve the problem that led to the permanent suspension.  In fact, apparently he was only given one opportunity to send and email.  It was rejected. He was told they do not discuss the reasons for these decisions.<p>This person lost everything they built over four years of hard work and had to file for bankruptcy when the commitments made by the business to support a multi-million-dollar-per-year supply pipeline caught-up with what had happened.  If you ask me, that says a lot about Amazon and the people who work there.  They are willing to make decisions that can destroy families and don&#x27;t seem to care enough to engage in a proper business-to-business discussion aimed at solving problems.  Instead it&#x27;s &quot;off with their heads&quot; and that&#x27;s it.  Businesses are not machines, they are people.  What Amazon is doing to families with businesses is sick and disgusting.<p>The latest trend we&#x27;ve been hearing has to do with their ads platform.  Apparently click fraud is rampant and Amazon is doing exactly nothing about it.  And, if what I am reading is correct, it is entirely possible they aren&#x27;t even equipped to deal with click fraud at all.  A number of our clients are reporting click through rates that are 10x to 60x historical rates and no sales whatsoever out of thousands of clicks per day/week.  Their experience isn&#x27;t far different from that of the people who face suspensions:  Amazon refuses to discuss what is going on.  Advertising on Amazon, for some sellers, has turned into the equivalent of throwing dollars into a bonfire.<p>I could go on but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.  My conclusion based on what I&#x27;ve read here and experienced through our clients is that it almost makes sense that the third party seller side of Amazon seems to be as messed-up as it is.  If portions of their operation are as caustic and abusive as some of the accounts on this thread relate nothing good can come out of that.  As I said before, business, ultimately, is about people.  And if the people who are the business are not happy, the business isn&#x27;t going to run well.  That&#x27;s what our clients are seeing out of the side of the Amazon monster they face every day.",1439673474

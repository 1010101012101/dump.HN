Precisely the flat earth effect that Friedman foretold.<p>I just read Guns, Germs, and Steel recently.  The underlying principle of all the ultimate causes that Diamond identifies is the auto-catalyst, where disparate entities collaborate and build on each other creating yet more possibilities for collaborating and building.  That's why I see stuff like this and get so excited - we're creating a worldwide auto-catalyst and who can tell what the future holds!",1203911891

Then you could vote front pages up or down, with the algorithm of the currently-winning front page hot swapping with the the previous algorithm. Of course you would need to do the same to select the algorithm that controlled the gravity on the algorithm voting page, to make sure that people didn't vote for fluff algorithms. And so on. Maybe the ideal news.yc is just news.yc all the way down.",1203910801

For 2006 it looks like it was $12.9m. If that rate is the same for now (it's probably more), then 1 day of Youtube earns $35,000. I doubt they would go after a country for that amount, though they would probably be upset about the outage and use whatever political muscle they have to pressure Pakistan to rethink.",1203910786

I guess I'm some sort of god in your world. :)<p>In my world, however, building transistors from raw silicon is an esoteric skill that doesn't have much use. Most of us prefer to spend a few bucks to buy our transistors by the billion, because transistors are a solved problem.<p>And I'm happy to use Ubuntu and the Mac to actually get things done, rather than pretend that repeatedly fixing bugs in the Slackware installer represents a valuable form of education.",1203910568

122870,comment,122750,122750,0,0,mercurio,,,"I suspect the solution lies in the phrase ""in fact empty"". The empty relation is trivially well founded. So look at why set membership for y should be the empty relation. I'll take a shot (with the caveat that I'm no logician, and I'm not entirely convinced by this argument myself).<p>It might be helpful first to remove x from the picture and define y as: y = {{y}} and y \neq {y}<p>First note that there can be at most one distinct member of {{y}}, which is {y}.\nSo if there exists z member of y, then z = {y}. Then y is a member of z, and by transitivity, y is member of y, and so y = z = {y}. This contradicts the assumption that y \neq {y}, so there can be no such z.",1203909466
122869,comment,122820,122820,0,0,xirium,,,"Use of InnoDB and an MD5 primary key is problematic and not an isolated situation.<p>InnoDB works in 16KB pages with 13 bytes of transactional overhead per row and a default page occupancy ratio of 15/16. InnoDB attempts to store rows in primary key order.<p>Using a composite primary key of (host_id,session_id) would be preferable using an MD5 hash as your primary key for two reasons. Firstly, the composite primary key is smaller. I'm assuming that they used an ASCII representation of the MD5 hash. That would be a 32 byte primary key. Whereas, a composite primary key could six bytes or less.<p>Having a smaller key means that B-tree index fan-out is improved. Essentially, the database has to access less index blocks to find a row of data. This occurs partly because the overall size of the index is smaller. More importantly, smaller keys allow more pointers and therefore the index tree is broader. Smaller size allows an increased proportion of the index will be cached and the broader tree ensures less skipping through uncached blocks.<p>Secondly, the output of the hash is essentially random. This conflicts with InnoDB's preference to store rows in primary key order. It also creates a huge amount of cache churning as branches are added anywhere and everywhere in the index tree. Whereas, a composite primary key with an ascending component allows very good insertion and lookup rates with minimal cache or disk seek operations.<p>I suspect that the situation was compounded by use of InnoDB's autoextend. When pages are consumed and the InnoDB storage is grown, data is effectively appended rather than being stored in preferential order. Multiple autoextend operations can make performance degrade. However, given the description of a performance wall, it is likely that another known circumstance was also encountered.",1203909152

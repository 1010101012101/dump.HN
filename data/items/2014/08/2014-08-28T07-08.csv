I&#x27;m not in the security field, but if the code there is anything like the codes I&#x27;ve worked with, I&#x27;d be surprised to find even a &quot;security-critical&quot; C program of any appreciable complexity that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> invoke undefined behaviour.<p>>Every time you write &#x27;+&#x27; in a C program between two signed values, do you do an overflow check beforehand?<p>Personally? I use signed scalar arithmetic very rarely. The bulk of the arithmetic I do is with unsigned integers (bit vectors, really) and arbitrary-precision integers. In fact, essentially the only time I <i>do</i> use signed scalar arithmetic is when I can determine statically that it won&#x27;t overflow. Signed integer overflow is a bitch, UB optimizations or no.<p>>Or do you do a global dataflow analysis of the program to prove that it can&#x27;t overflow?<p>That&#x27;s the basic idea behind seL4, for example.<p>>Arguing for a technical correctness that is observably almost impossible to achieve in the wild is what&#x27;s really pointless.<p>Sure, but only because everyone writes their security-critical programs in a language that couldn&#x27;t more effectively impede security if it were designed to do so.

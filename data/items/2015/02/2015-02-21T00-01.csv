9084158,comment,9081088,9082560,0,0,Encosia,,,"To underbluewaters&#x27; example of just getting a simple recipe on the screen, building a mobile-friendly page to display that kind of content is certainly not hard. For example, this is a recipe page that I personally worked on a few months ago (sorry, we didn&#x27;t have a chicken tikka masala recipe...): <a href=""http://tailgating.publix.com/recipes/29/caramel-hickory-chicken-with-crunchy-asian-slaw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tailgating.publix.com/recipes/29/caramel-hickory-chic...</a><p>On my phone, that page is every bit as quick as a native app. The presentation doesn&#x27;t suffer. It&#x27;s actually quite a bit better than many native apps I&#x27;ve had the misfortune of installing.<p>More importantly, the content is actually discoverable from web search. The alternative is forcing the user to choose a recipes app from an opaque app store search, wait to download/install it, then search in that single silo of content and hope it has the content they want. Then, rinse/repeat if they don&#x27;t find a recipe they like. Even if they happen to find a nice native app on the first try that does have a good UI, good content, <i>and</i> the specific content they want, that is a vastly inferior experience.<p>Can you create a poor mobile web experience? Sure. The situation isn&#x27;t very much different than janky, slow desktop sites that are laden with too many third-party scripts for ads, tracking, social, etc. Mobile does exacerbate the effect of that kind of sloppiness, but I think that stems from sites where content is secondary to advertising/social, not the feasibility or difficulty of creating a good mobile web experience.<p>I was going to add a disclaimer to the link above asking folks to be gentle if they peeked under the hood, because I developed that site in an insanely short amount of time for how much content and functionality is there, but maybe that&#x27;s an important data point in and of itself. If it were so difficult to develop a decent mobile web experience, there&#x27;s no way I could have shipped that full site in about two weeks of billable hours. Not to mention, we focused a lot more on the desktop layout than mobile, based on analytics. I wouldn&#x27;t say mobile was an afterthought, but the phone layout was a fairly small fraction of the overall effort.",1424480343

It&#x27;s harder in the beginning because you aren&#x27;t sure what to use. Once you get a feeling for what libraries are best though, it&#x27;s a great advantage that those libraries move forward so quickly without being tied to GHC development practices which have to move more slowly.<p>> * JSON parsing seem to be more complicated than it needs to be<p>Really? Here is some JSON parsing code I wrote the other day[0] to show how pattern matching and exhaustiveness checks in Haskell are useful:<p><pre><code>    {&quot;purchaseType&quot;: &quot;Rent&quot;,&quot;price&quot;: 0.99,&quot;title&quot;: &quot;inception&quot;}
</code></pre>
Here is an implementation in Haskell:<p><pre><code>    {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
    
    import Data.Aeson
    import GHC.Generics
    import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as BL
    
    data PurchaseType = Free | Rent | Buy | Subscriber deriving (Show, Generic)
    instance FromJSON PurchaseType
    instance ToJSON PurchaseType
    
    data Media = Media { title :: String, price :: Float, purchaseType :: PurchaseType} deriving (Show, Generic)
    
    instance FromJSON Media
    instance ToJSON Media
    
    jsonData = &quot;{\&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;inception\&quot;, \&quot;price\&quot;: 0.99, \&quot;purchaseType\&quot;: \&quot;Rent\&quot;}&quot;
   
    main = print $ (decode jsonData :: Maybe Media)
    -- running main gets:
    -- λ> main
    -- Just (Media {title = &quot;inception&quot;, price = 0.99, purchaseType = Rent})
</code></pre>
> * Also got confused by keywords naming: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5689951"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5689951</a><p>Those are just things you have to get used to and imo don&#x27;t really seem like a big deal. Every language has these kinds of things, but Haskell has less than most. To qualify that last statement, once you&#x27;ve learned their very different set of abstractions you know everything you need to know. It is less work in general dealing with programmer defined abstractions built on top of functor, monoid, etc because those custom abstractions more closely resemble them, which is an effect of them having to follow laws.<p>> * I found Yesod API to be inelegant. I found it odd that it needs so many non-standard compiler extensions, which might be a sign that the language is not expressive enough.<p>Looking at a Yesod example[1], the most language extensions I saw were:<p><pre><code>    {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

</code></pre>
TemplateHaskell and OverloadedStrings are both just conveniences, I suppose there could be an argument that MutliParamTypeClasses and TypeFamilies mean the language is not expressive enough. One of the reasons for use of language extensions so much in Haskell is that it is designed by committee, it&#x27;s quite possible that other languages might have already deprecated these language extensions and moved them into the core language.<p>> * One-letter variables seem to be idiomatic. This is unappealing to me because I try to make my code readable.<p>The only place I usually see one letter variable names is where it&#x27;s quite obvious what they are. I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue it&#x27;s better to use something besides x and y in this function definition for instance:<p><pre><code>    add x y = x + y
</code></pre>
To check out your claims, let&#x27;s grab a few random snippets of code (I&#x27;m hitting the spacebar randomly then choosing first function I see) from the most popular[2] Haskell libraries:<p>containers[3]:<p><pre><code>    isSubmapOf :: (Ord k,Eq a) => Map k a -> Map k a -> Bool
    isSubmapOf m1 m2 = isSubmapOfBy (==) m1 m2

</code></pre>
bytestring[4]:<p><pre><code>    -- | Add a list of non-negative numbers.  Errors out on overflow.
    checkedSum :: String -> [Int] -> Int
    checkedSum fun = go 0
      where go !a (x:xs)
                | ax >= 0   = go ax xs
                | otherwise = overflowError fun
              where ax = a + x
    go a  _         = a
</code></pre>
directory[5]:<p><pre><code>    setOwnerReadable :: Bool -> Permissions -> Permissions
    setOwnerReadable b p = p { readable = b }
</code></pre>
What I personally take from above is that while Haskell does use single letter variables, the types make it obvious what those variables are. As a test, I&#x27;ll go to the next popular library and look for a longer function to see if this line of thought breaks down.<p>text[6]:<p><pre><code>    fromString :: String -> Builder
    fromString str = Builder $ \k (Buffer p0 o0 u0 l0) ->
        let loop !marr !o !u !l [] = k (Buffer marr o u l)
            loop marr o u l s@(c:cs)
                | l <= 1 = do
                    arr <- A.unsafeFreeze marr
                    let !t = Text arr o u
                    marr&#x27; <- A.new chunkSize
                    ts <- inlineInterleaveST (loop marr&#x27; 0 0 chunkSize s)
                    return $ t : ts
                | otherwise = do
                    n <- unsafeWrite marr (o+u) c
                    loop marr o (u+n) (l-n) cs
        in loop p0 o0 u0 l0 str
      where
        chunkSize = smallChunkSize
</code></pre>
Alright... str is obviously string, marr is mutable array.. o, u, and l... what could those be? Well it&#x27;s getting set from the Buffer type, so it looks like I&#x27;ll have to see what the type of that is.<p><pre><code>    Prelude GHC.IO.Buffer> :i Buffer
    type role Buffer phantom
    data Buffer e
      = Buffer {bufRaw :: {-# UNPACK #-} !RawBuffer e,
                bufState :: BufferState,
                bufSize :: {-# UNPACK #-} !Int,
                bufL :: {-# UNPACK #-} !Int,
                bufR :: {-# UNPACK #-} !Int}
             -- Defined in ‘GHC.IO.Buffer’

    Prelude GHC.IO.Buffer> :t Buffer
    Buffer
      :: RawBuffer e -> BufferState -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Buffer e
</code></pre>
I&#x27;ll concede that names other than o, u, l, and k would have helped here. Perhaps even renaming ts as texts would have been more clear.<p>> * For the same reason, frequent use of special characters in operators (, <>, ///, etc.) in the standard library and in third-party libraries was not appealing.<p>&quot;Special characters&quot; in operators? When most people say special characters they mean unicode. <> and /// look to be normal characters to me. With that said I go back and forth between finding operators appealing/unappealing. For instance I find this to be understandable and a good choice:<p><pre><code>    &quot;home&quot; </> &quot;cody&quot; </> &quot;Downloads&quot;
</code></pre>
I also think that making users learn a few symbols isn&#x27;t so bad, as long as you don&#x27;t go to far. The main symbols I&#x27;d say you need to know are >>=, <$>, <<i>>, and maybe <> and >=>. >>= doesn&#x27;t have a non-symbol alternative I don&#x27;t believe, <$> is fmap, <</i>> is ap, <> is mappend, and I&#x27;m not sure if >=> has a non-symbol alternative.<p>> I was disappointed because I was attracted by referential integrity, strong compiler checks, pattern matching and function composition<p>Those are many of the reasons I was attracted to Haskell and still use it today, are you claiming Haskell doesn&#x27;t have those things? If you are making that claim just because exhaustiveness checking isn&#x27;t an error by default, I&#x27;d say that seems disingenious.<p>> but overall I was left with the impression that the Haskell environment was not very well polished from a software engineering point of view.<p>Was it just the above that left you with that impression, or was it other things as well? Can you give an example of a language that is well polished from a software engineering point of view and what makes it &quot;polished&quot;?<p>0: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9037452"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9037452</a><p>1: <a href=""https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/project-templates/file-server"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/project-templates/file-ser...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://kwangyulseo.com/2014/02/03/top-30-haskell-pakcages-with-most-reverse-dependencies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kwangyulseo.com/2014/02/03/top-30-haskell-pakcages-wi...</a><p>3: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.5.6.3/docs/src/Data-Map-Base.html#isSubmapOf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.5.6.3/docs/s...</a><p>4: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-0.10.4.1/docs/src/Data-ByteString-Internal.html#checkedSum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-0.10.4.1/docs/...</a><p>5: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/directory-1.2.1.0/docs/src/System-Directory.html#setOwnerReadable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/directory-1.2.1.0/docs/sr...</a><p>6: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-1.2.0.4/docs/src/Data-Text-Internal-Builder.html#fromString"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-1.2.0.4/docs/src/Dat...</a>",1424480096

We haven&#x27;t always made the right call for sure.<p>I think Metalsmith and Khaos are pretty good examples of why we feel the need to build our own.<p>The crux of it is that the alternatives (Yeoman and Jekyll) aren&#x27;t designed to be augmented without opinion. They are designed as &quot;solves all your needs tools and gives you the preferred workflow&quot;.<p>Metalsmith doesn&#x27;t claim to solve all your needs. It actually doesn&#x27;t solve any of your needs out of the box, unless you need a really complex way to copy files from a directory to another without doing anything else to them. It defines an extremely simple core—an API that extendability can be based around—and then hands over all of the logic to plugins. Which means it&#x27;s pretty much never going to get in your way.<p>Similarly with Khaos—which we haven&#x27;t really perfected yet—we&#x27;re looking for an extremely simple core API design that people can augment to solve their scaffolding needs. We want it ourselves to scaffold integrations for Segment, to scaffold new Node and Go projects, we&#x27;re even thinking about scaffolding Segment-branded PDFs.<p>Yeoman doesn&#x27;t think that way, evidenced by this paragraph from their landing page:<p>> Through our official Generators, we promote the &quot;Yeoman workflow&quot;. This workflow is a robust and opinionated client-side stack, comprising tools and frameworks that can help developers quickly build beautiful web applications. We take care of providing everything needed to get started without any of the normal headaches associated with a manual setup.<p>Khaos doesn&#x27;t prescribe any workflows or client-side stacks, it just lets you scaffold things. What you want to scaffold is up to you, as it should be. You can use it for eBooks for all we care :)<p>Khaos also happens to be built on Metalsmith. It&#x27;s just a series of plugins that run before the files are written to an output directory. That wouldn&#x27;t have been possible with Jekyll, we&#x27;d have had to roll our own again inside Khaos or do some incredibly hacky shit to get it to work.<p>---<p>All that said, some of our projects suffer from NIH. And when they do it&#x27;s usually clear over time since we get sick of dealing with them and we use something that has more widespread support behind it. But for others, we&#x27;re super glad we&#x27;ve rolled our own because we get tired of other people&#x27;s opinionated software :)<p>There are definitely lots of existing pieces of software that we like to use though.

If that’s true (and I’m not sure it is but that’s the sales pitch anyways), the finance sector grows as productivity in other industries decreases, because then (a) the decision to put capital into other industries becomes less and less clear and (b) the financial services therefore become more valuable.<p>(If you want to change this, you need to modify the incentives to either (a) make the finance sector less appealing, (b) make other industries more appealing or (c) both - but that&#x27;s another issue altogether)<p>(The biggest problem with the theory above is of course that prices and returns are often a function of things other than actual productivity and instead rely on future potential productivity, which is another word for speculation, and so there’s a huge opportunity to manipulate the markets which happens all that time, resulting in people making $$ without actually being more productive)<p>For the HN audience, the good/interesting thing is that we are currently in a market where tech is one of the industries with (relatively) high productivity (for extreme example, see WhatsApp, Instagram, etc., where very few individuals created very much value), and therefore you see interesting trends: more institutional money is pouring into the market which leads to more money competing for fewer start-ups which leads to higher valuations.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capital-fundraising-jumped-62-in-2014-1421039104"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capital-fundraising-jump...</a><p>On a human capital level, talent is also moving (relative to historical trends) from finance to tech, and on an anecdotal level, the number of former bankers turned MBAs turned Product Managers has been pretty astounding to me - fair amount of press addressing the issue as well:<p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mbas-abandon-wall-street-for-silicon-valley-140238593.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mbas-abandon-wall-street-for-s...</a>

Where splitting things out can actually discourage updating if the cost is too high.<p>There&#x27;s also a big open question around what should be a separate repository, and what is separation just for separation&#x27;s sake? A similar kind of question that has to be answered for individual functions in a codebase.

The problem was creating the cross mounting post for Cherry. The process that ended up working was somewhat as you suggested: we basically used a lathe to remove material from a standard key cap until just the post was left and then we attached the post with a good adhesive to our custom key caps. The problem with this process is that it is very expensive in terms of labor/time and requires a high degree of precision to ensure uniformity. I think I might eventually make a keyboard using Cherry MX switches using this process, but for the current project the goal is to produce at least 100 keyboards while keeping the cost down. We tried for several months to make the Cherry MX Red work, but ended up deciding Matias was the better option in this case.<p>2. Modding key switches works well for a single keyboard, but really causes costs to soar if used in production. This wouldn&#x27;t work for us because one of the main design points of the keyboard we&#x27;re working on is making it financially accessible to a wide range of people.<p>4. This is a fair point. Honestly, I&#x27;m not too deep into the mechanical keyboard world beyond this one project, so I don&#x27;t have a good feeling for other people&#x27;s use cases. My hope, though, is that people do some really strange things with these switches and start innovating in ways I wouldn&#x27;t have thought of.<p>Thanks for all your feedback - it&#x27;s been really helpful.

Too bad she still doesn&#x27;t like it. :P<p>I know someone in that class of people that &quot;can&#x27;t math&quot;. Initially I tutored her in algebra and she did alright when we were working together, but as soon as I turned her loose or she went in to take a test she couldn&#x27;t remember or apply the techniques. She was allowed to go into Pre-calculus (she wants to be a Chem Major). But without extensive help on each section she would fail spectacularly. And after a while it became obvious why. She could think logically and when explained clearly or relating to other concepts she&#x27;s recently learned it all made sense, but she had so many deficiencies in basic math that nothing past that would really stick.  As an example I taught her the formula for computing the area of a square multiple times, but she would swear this was the first time each time because there was no foundation to hang that new knowledge on.<p>Now I but I have her working through Khan Academy from the ground up (K-2nd) and now that she&#x27;s up to 5th grade and I&#x27;ve explained how basic concepts relate together, like multiplication and area or fractions and division she&#x27;s actually starting to &quot;get it&quot;.<p>She just lost the thread of &quot;mathing&quot; around 3rd grade and never found it again. Now that she can go through it at her pace and has someone that can patiently explain it from multiple angles it makes sense and she&#x27;s doing things on her own that I was afraid she&#x27;s never &quot;get&quot;.<p>That said without Khan academy and a detailed list of sub-topics in math (45 individual skills for dealing with fractions for example) I&#x27;d have never been able to cover all the small things that add up to a detailed understanding of arithmetic. I&#x27;d have covered fractions from maybe a handful of angles and called it good knowing that it wasn&#x27;t enough practice without having an answer for how to practice more without stupid rote repetition of the same kinds of problem.",1424477137

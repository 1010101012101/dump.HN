It just banned it.<p>Second, if it <i>is</i> for security reasons, Google should improve Android&#x27;s security architecture so something like this wouldn&#x27;t be possible in the first place. It shouldn&#x27;t rely on policy. But my guess is it <i>wants</i> some apps to be able to control other apps like this, because that&#x27;s how it can do its tracking, too.<p>And isn&#x27;t this how Android antivirus apps work, too? Don&#x27;t they &quot;interfere&quot; with other apps when they scan their code? Either way, this sounds like Google would have to ban other classes of apps, too, if this policy were to be applied fairly.<p>And once again we go back to <i>selective</i> policy enforcement, which always sucks.",1409414334

8246716,comment,8246255,8246396,3,0,mcguire,,,"&quot;<i>High dividend stocks are almost by definition risky stocks.</i>&quot;<p>Pardon me, but that is more or less the opposite of the traditional received wisdom.<p>High dividend stocks come in two varieties:<p>* Low-growth, mature, typically capital-intensive companies, especially those in highly-regulated industries. Think power generation, some real estate investments, and so on. Since stock price appreciation is not in the cards, dividends are the only returns an investor can expect and thus are higher. These are typically the safest stocks, although &quot;safety&quot; is relative; stocks are more risky than most other investments.<p>* A dividend-paying company whose stock price has been depressed, typically due to specific events: poor management decisions, a bad environment, competition, or what have you. These are typically considered &quot;value&quot; investments; the stock price has been pushed down, usually for good reasons, but also usually, too far. The dividend on these is unlikely to be maintainable---management will usually reduce it as part of doing something to get the company back on its feet or whatever. However, the investment itself is not particularly unsafe, in my personal opinion. See Buffet&#x27;s &quot;The Superinvestors of Graham-Doddsville&quot; for some other people who feel likewise.<p>The second group is probably not what the poster wants and I would be uncomfortable focusing solely on the first since those kinds of industries are typically economically linked.<p>On the other hand, you do have to know what you mean by &quot;high dividend&quot;. Thanks to the &quot;dividends are doubly-taxed&quot; lunacy, and double thanks to the &quot;growth is everything&quot; mentality, dividends are very low or non-existent. Anything above, say, 4% (to pull a number out of my flying monkeys) is probably a return of capital, not a return on capital; the money you get as dividends includes a partial payment of your original investment and you cannot expect to get your original investment back when you sell it. In fact, it will disappear entirely over time. And anything over 1.5% to 2% (again with the flying-monkey-numbers) probably represents the value investment situation rather than something sustainable. The 6% mentioned by the grandparent probably is indeed pretty risky.<p>Also, the bond market is usually considered safer than stocks, with a higher interest &quot;dividend&quot;. But I don&#x27;t really know much about that.<p>This should not be considered financial advice, I&#x27;m some random dude on the internet. Look carefully before you leap, try to learn what you&#x27;re doing before you try to do it, and try to stick with reputable instruction. There is a crap-ton of bad information out there.<p>[Did I write something particularly controversial?]",1409413674

Most marijuana, even medical marijuana, is not going to contain enough CBD content to be effective at treating certain ailments.<p>In the case of kids with Dravet Syndrome, the difference is drastic.  Smoking medical marijuana all day long is not helpful at all, but smoking marijuana bred for CBD potency is downright curative, at least at preventing seizures.<p>Charlotte Figi has dozens of grand mal seizures a day if left to her own devices.  The average medical marijuana does not help her, but CBD-potent marijuana effectively quells her seizures.  A little bit of oil extracted from CBD halted the grand mal seizures.<p>The downside is that practically nobody is growing this type of marijuana, and specifically, we&#x27;re breeding most medical marijuana to have higher THC content at the expense of CBDs.<p>In this case, yes, pharmaceutical-grade products are possibly superior, especially as they can begin regulating it and testing its actual effectiveness towards treating chronic issues like Dravet that &quot;smoking pot&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily impact at all.",1409413669

The problem with all of them seems they don&#x27;t actually work reliably.<p>I tried IFFT a number of times. I&#x27;d love for it to work, but I only use it as a &quot;it&#x27;s ok if this breaks, missing data, etc.&quot; tool. Admittedly this is not 100% their fault as you are at the mercy of the shoddiness of other APIs, but bugs upon bugs and the less than reliable nature of IFFT actually executing things in a timely, durable manner makes it 100x less useful and impossible to build on top of for real apps.<p>I also feel that from a business point of view, relying on other people&#x27;s services is consistently a trap. Whether it&#x27;s social networks like Twitter, COTS like SharePoint, or something like Evernote, it&#x27;s always a trap. These businesses can break your code at any time they choose, shut off your service, or simply go under. It takes a lot of work circumventing their bugs and terrible APIs as well. Hats off for trying, but I don&#x27;t feel like a company like this is usually a good long-term investment.<p>Add to these problems the fact that most internet &quot;typical&quot; users would never use IFFT or &quot;get it&quot; the way it&#x27;s presented today. Moreover, most programmers want more control, something more powerful, or can just do everything here better themselves exactly to their use cases.

The extra bit of computation was invisible in the face of cache misses.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that most customers of std::vector don&#x27;t really need contiguous memory, they just need something that has fast linear access time. In this sense, std::vector is a poor design.",1409411135

8246606,comment,8245556,8246061,3,0,exratione,,,"Absent progress in medical science, your odds of achieving that end are very remote. 75% of everyone, including most of those with the best diet and lifestyle choices behind them, are dead by 90 at the present time. The winnowing is precipitous over the next ten years following that: 1% make it to 100. Few of those lack serious health issues that greatly impact their ability to enjoy life.<p>Unless something changes these odds are improving only very slowly, with less than a year added to life expectancy at 60 every decade. This is an incidental trend, brought about despite the fact that no-one has really tried to seriously address the root causes of aging and age-related disease in the past.<p>If you really want to live to be old, and do so in good health, then the way to increase the odds is to get out there and make a difference: contribute to research funds, advocate for more longevity science, ways to treat the root causes of aging rather than patching over the late stage consequences. The whole field of medicine as it pertains to aging and age-related frailty and disease must be disrupted and change greatly from where it stands today.",1409411025

The app is called Truthly and it allows anyone to easily create and join a &quot;Truth Is&quot;, &quot;tbh&quot;  and more. If you don&#x27;t know what those things are they are quite common posts on instagram and then your followers like the post and you send them a text saying &quot;Truth is your funny&quot; or &quot;Truth is i haven&#x27;t seen you in forever!&quot; and things like that. Anyway it is quite popular but also very complicated . This app makes it easy to create them, supplies you with some cool images and you can request/read your answers with the app! So far I have had a lot of positive feedback and over 100 users (though mostly just in my high school). I think it could be very popular but I am unsure of how to market it to the target audience of 11-17 year olds. I would love to hear any ideas! Thank you!",1409410956

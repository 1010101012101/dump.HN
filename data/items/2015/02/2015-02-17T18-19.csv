Nothing.<p>I would not be surprised in the least if they charged left-handed customers 1% more than right-handed customers.<p>If Wal-Mart sold a $300 television set for $3, I could see a case for <i>OBVIOUS pricing error</i>.  Wal-Mart has a consistent pricing policy, wherein the price is the same for anyone who walks into the store, and clearly printed on the shelf label.<p>Not so for airlines.  A typical airline flight could have dozens of fare classes, and any given seat on it could be mapped to multiple fare classes.  If someone buys a &quot;K&quot; fare, they get seat 14B.  Now if someone tries to get a &quot;Q&quot; fare with their loyalty points, the flight is sold out, because &quot;Q&quot; fares are only good for row 14 on that flight.  Later, the &quot;K&quot; fare cancels for only a partial refund, and someone pays quadruple the price for a &quot;G&quot; fare and gets exactly the same seat, but their fare is fully refundable.  If you walked onto the plane and pointed at seat 14B, and asked airline personnel how much it would cost to sit there for that flight, not a single one of them could tell you.  It doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>So if they made a &quot;mistake&quot;, then too fucking bad.  Honor the fare you sold, you bastards, because our patience with your price discrimination games was already at an end 10 years ago.",1424199587
9064227,comment,9063884,9064124,0,0,thusoy,,,"I would guess so, yes. You can never prove that something is random, merely that it behaves randomly &quot;enough&quot;. There are lots of testsuites[1][2] you can run that will test that a generator is uniform and doesn&#x27;t follow any patterns or has any other statistical weaknesses, but you can never <i>prove</i> that something is fully random without knowing the process that generates those numbers. A statistically sound RNG might just output the digits of pi, which would be non-repeating, uniform and pass any randomness test, but if you knew which digit the RNG started from and how many it has output so far you can easily predict the next one. Likewise if you&#x27;re given a large enough sample you can search the digits to figure out the state of the RNG.<p>[1]: dieharder: <a href=""http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-22-rev1a/SP800-22rev1a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-22-rev1a/SP80...</a>",1424199573

9064201,comment,9063216,9063216,0,0,penland,,,"That&#x27;s a good overall article - I&#x27;ve been switching back and forth between FreeBSD and Debian for several years now, and I never spend more than a couple of month without using one of them.<p>The one thing that surprised me was his take on FreeBSD&#x27;s package management system, pkg.  PKG is relatively new, having been released in late summer 2012. Prior to that, FreeBSD relied on the ports collection, which was (is) a vast tree of Makefile&#x27;s allowing you to create custom builds of virtually any software imaginable.<p>While pkg is still raw on the edges, I VASTLY prefer it to Debian&#x27;s hodgepodge of package management tools that all do 90% of the other, though none of them do it cleanly and none of them have straightforward interfaces.  Am I using dpkg here?  What about aptitude?  Or should I just roll w/ apt-get?  All of these tools combine the ease of use of git with the flexibility of a Maven build.  If you know how to use to descend deep into the depths of git or Maven, this isn&#x27;t an issue ( and for the author, it certainly is not ).  Yet there are numerous simple tasks ( like say, searching for a package remotely when you aren&#x27;t sure the exact name ) which still require hitting up google and settling in for a Click-Your-Way-To-Adventure session.<p>PKG, in contrast, is both simplistic and flexible ( it reminds me of a industrial grade version of Brew in some sense ).  It&#x27;s a tool that I find myself integrating into my workflow beyond simple installs / updates, particularly it&#x27;s seamless integration with jails.  Configuration of remote repositories is vastly simplified as well.<p>PKG is not perfect by an means - it definitely has worts that need to be taken care of.  I&#x27;m also sure that PKG probably feels a tad inadequte to some hard core sys admins - pkg has the look and feel of a tool designed by a programmer looking to handle normal cases than a tool designed to provide a sys admin with an atom bomb if necessary.  Yet the system is still relatively new and as the bugs continue to get ironed out it&#x27;s a reminder to me of why I love FreeBSD in a lot of ways - the abstraction point is flawless and it gets out of my way.",1424199225

9064183,comment,9057966,9062003,0,0,wheatBread,,,"I think the core ideas can be used in many settings, that is true. One can use a pattern like this in C if they want. I think there are a couple questions to consider when asking &quot;how does language really help?&quot;<p>1. How much is the language going to help you independently arrive at nice architecture? It took millions of people 20 years to arrive at this pattern in JS, and it literally happens in every Elm program out there automatically. The pattern described in &quot;The Elm Architecture&quot; really does come from looking at people&#x27;s Elm code and seeing the naturally arising patterns. So new people don&#x27;t need to read this post and learn these concepts, commercial users don&#x27;t need to have strict discipline, the architecture just comes out this way.<p>2. How much is the language going to fight you or help you when you <i>already</i> know what you want to do? In particular, ADTs are a key part of why this is so nice in Elm, and when you are working in JS or TypeScript, writing &quot;the same code&quot; leads to code that can be quite awful. Even when you know why you want it, it often does not seem worthwhile to fake ADTs. Immutability is another key aspect that&#x27;s hard to get in many languages. I&#x27;ll write more about this in some future post, but I think lack of side-effects is another key aspect of keeping the architecture nice.<p>3. How much is a language going to help a team of 20 keep this up in a large code base? Will the intern or the new hire be able to do it right? Once you start to get cracks, do they continue to grow? If you lack a module system or a type system, are you going to start running into other scaling problems? In this setting, having tools that guide you to the right answer is extremely valuable.<p>So I think language matters a lot, but I would :P",1424199055

Their phones are underwhelming regardless of their massive &#x27;mobile/cloud&#x27; first initiatives and are now the bottom-basement phone for the ultra cheap buyer. Office365 is interesting but predates Nadella&#x27;s leadership. Azure never panned out to be the Windows EC2.  OSX keeps eating up laptop marketshare (go to any college campus, no one has windows). Surface RT was a complete disaster. Win8 was underwhelming at best.<p>On the enterprise side of things, a lot of sysadmins are shocked at the low quality of security updates and the massive delay in getting them out. How many were recalled in 2014? Nadella&#x27;s personal mission at MS was redoing QA and as far as I can tell, he&#x27;s somehow made it worse.  Tabletizing interfaces in Win8 and Server 2013 was a questionable move. Office 2013 is a pig with lipstick and is known for its horror stories.  Licensing has somehow gotten more bureaucratic and expensive.<p>I&#x27;m not fan of Ballmer, but I think the Ballmer/Gates magic was a real thing for a time, and its obvious this magic needed Gates to work. Nadella&#x27;s Steve Jobs impersonation is becoming tiresome imo. The cloud/mobile first initiative ate from MS&#x27;s core competencies- rock solid and featureful enterprise software.  The only thing I can say about Nadella is that he&#x27;s recognizing how important a classic start menu is for enterprise users and its coming back in Win10. Out of all of MS&#x27;s products, Win10 is the only thing of interest. &quot;Me toos&quot; like its budget tablets/phones or the buying of skype or minecraft, just seem like desperate moves from a company that has lost its way.  Frankly, I&#x27;d like to see enterprise broken off from loss leaders like surface (which is sold at a loss) and all the things its giving away for free as a sort of catch up to FOSS dominated and Apple dominated areas.  One just seems to be eating the other, and the one being eaten is the moneymaker. MS is just too big and is chasing so many tails. Nadella fought to keep the xbox division when investors were pissed about it last year. How much political capital did it cost for him to keep that pig?<p>I certainly don&#x27;t think MS is going to fail anytime soon, but I don&#x27;t think its somehow changed its ways. Its still too many chefs chasing too many targets, many of which are probably unhittable for such a bureaucratic giant. Windows phone goes for 50 bucks nowadays and the sales are still unimpressive.  Getting this late to the mobile game is a killer.  There may be no way to recover lost marketshare that mobile has taken.  How many billions will Nadella burn through trying? We&#x27;re almost three years into the Surface line. When does it finally pay off? When do I actually see one in public?",1424198990
9064170,comment,9057996,9060970,0,0,yellowapple,,,"You may very well be right; I <i>am</i> looking at this from thousands of miles away, after all!  And I&#x27;m sure everyone here would enjoy hearing your perspective on it, seeing as much of Hacker News (I&#x27;d reckon) is in a similar boat.<p>That said, it should be understandable why I&#x27;d take your comment with a skeptical grain of salt.  Slave-owners in the Southern United States (something which I&#x27;m in much closer proximity to, though perhaps not temporally) typically had a <i>lot</i> of justifications for owning slaves, ranging from &quot;We&#x27;re helping them establish a modern culture!&quot; to &quot;We&#x27;re introducing them to God and Jesus!&quot; to &quot;They <i>like</i> to work; they were bred for it!&quot; to &quot;We treat them pretty well, actually!&quot; (this was a blatant lie in many cases, mind you) to &quot;What else would they do if we were to not give them work to do?&quot;.  Similar justifications persisted throughout the days of the Jim Crow laws and their ilk; even after slavery had been abolished once and for all, the now-free black populace was - in the South - rarely (if ever) encouraged to deviate from manual agrarian labor, since that was popularly believed to be their &quot;place&quot;.  The Civil War was indeed a pretty powerful wake-up call to the ways where the North&#x27;s automated/streamlined manufacturing and agriculture - using machines instead of men - mopped the metaphorical floor with Southern slave-driven manual labor, but it took a <i>long</i> time for the South to fully realize that.<p>Today, the United States is still dealing with high unemployment rates of various minorities - including blacks.  This is likely caused by automation in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.  It sucks for those who don&#x27;t have jobs in the short term, but - ultimately - it&#x27;ll encourage those who were previously stuck with factory and farm jobs at best to seek educational financial assistance (which is available for low-income households) and work their way into better careers.  I&#x27;ll take that - along with the bit of ultimately-temporary unemployment caused by it - over blacks and Hispanics (among other minorities; Asian immigrants were victims of this as well, but a large-enough portion of the Asian-American population eventually managed to achieve white-collar jobs and top-tier academic performance that the public view has shifted in the other direction entirely) being treated as if manual labor is the only thing they&#x27;re good for.<p>You can&#x27;t blame me for seeing the parallels here.  If India is willing to burn money on giving people menial busy-work for the sake of &quot;employment&quot;, it should be more willing to instead burn money on giving those people subsidized education and placement into more modernized roles (like operating or maintaining the machines which replaced their old jobs, for example).  The reluctance to do so indicates - to me at least, as someone who can relate his own experiences to this - a cultural or societal unwillingness to allow them to do so; the reasons for not doing so are certainly not ones grounded in rationality or economic common sense, which thus implies a more emotional line of thought.",1424198987

Obviously companies want whatever they can get.<p>But it&#x27;s actually less grim than it seems:<p>1. there are laws,<p>2. the price pressures exist for the coordinating companies as well, as long as there continues to be competition, and<p>3. &#x27;real&#x27; autonomy has a lot of benefits for people who are into that.<p>So first, there are already laws for this. (Which may or may not be sufficient regulation, but they cover a certain amount of what&#x27;s discussed in the article, hence the lawsuit). Existing laws already stipulate what is/isn&#x27;t a private contractor, for instance.<p>Ie, for work like programming, usually one can&#x27;t be mandated to work in a specific office, or on specific hours, unless there&#x27;s something about the job that particularly demands it. (Not that this sort of thing comes up a lot in programming, but there are definitely laws around this).<p>And in fact it&#x27;s much easier for companies like Uber and Handy to be targeted for misclassification of workers than the more informal economies of construction workers, etc. So if there are holes in the law and they get plugged, that could be cool.<p>Secondly, &quot;taking a heftier cut than it should from the business transaction&quot; isn&#x27;t a very damning indictment. But if Uber faces real competition with Lyft, for instance, the cut they can take is dictated by the market, both for drivers and passengers!<p>Lastly, it&#x27;s not just workers taking on risk. Workers also gain freedom.<p>That sounds comical to some.<p>But I know a lot of people who are very passionate about volunteer work, and absolutely love jobs that they can do for a few hours a week and forget about -- even if it means they&#x27;re living very simply.

People (not everyone who would buy things at Radio Shack is hardcore) only have so much time. If they have something better to do than a stamp collection (was big years ago) or a model train set (also a big thing) or building model airliners with glue (did that one myself) then they will do the most fun interesting useful thing with their time.  Oh yeah some kids did baseball cards. And we even collected decals and stickers at one point.<p>One thing I did back in the 70&#x27;s was I had a darkroom in the basement which I would spend hours in. So I visited specialty camera stores and bought darkroom supplies, cameras and so on and spent hours upon hours doing that (turning it into a business which I made a bit of money from). While there were many reasons I did that, one was that there really weren&#x27;t many things that I could do with my time that I found more interesting. This was before PC&#x27;s or at least where I was located and that type of &quot;hobby&quot;.

If you are a freelancer basing your time on market rates then you might as well just get a job. You are setting your fee as if you were an employee while taking on all the headaches of running a business.<p>You base your fee not on market hourly rates, but based on value. You don&#x27;t charge the same fee building a campaign for Little Bobby&#x27;s Lemonade Stand (which brings in a profit of 5 bucks for a couple of hours work and then shuts down for the coming school week) as you do for a high stakes start-up which is flush with funding. In the latter example, you might join a small team and have a large impact. The difference in the value of your execution vs someone who drops the ball could be huge, and you can&#x27;t express this in terms of market rates.<p>Bringing this value (targeting high value clients and delivering high value services) is a completely different component of running a business than simply being a programmer and marketing yourself as such.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think there is a talent shortage.

Yes / No / Allow for all contents of Z / Allow All Locations&quot;.<p>That would be a misnomer, because &quot;important&quot; file locations like ~/.config, ~/.share, etc would always prompt user acknowledgement when a program tries to open something in those and it is not the originator program (ie, VLC can open something like ~/.config/vlc or ~/.share/vlc, but if it tried to open ~/.config/mplayer or ~/.share/mplayer you would get a prompt notification of it.<p>> access (and unique probably) to raw devices read-only<p>I don&#x27;t think this is hard at all, device permissions are something that mostly already works. Just say &quot;App X wants to access device Y, allow? Yes / No / Always&quot;.<p>With good package management and distributors, you could have most of these &quot;prompts&quot; configured with sane defaults so you don&#x27;t get spam when VLC opens files - the distro can just trust VLC in ~/Music and ~/Video all the time, and any user made directories, so just give it access everywhere except the config and share dirs, so on and so forth. When you install something it would make sense to tell users what it uses in the same way Android does upon installation, and if it tries to access something post-install you get a dialog about it (ie, VLC could say at install it uses the network, or it could ask at runtime if it tries to access the network).<p>Why would VLC need raw audio out? Route through pulseaudio, nobody should be opening raw audio devices anymore unless you are Ardour.<p>I think the real problem is nobody gives a shit about desktop security. I mean I run Archlinux where there isn&#x27;t a single working MAC solution that does not require days of prep work. But having delved a lot into Mac and such, I have no faith in Apparmor or SELinux when PAX and Grsec is doing a much better job and nobody is using it.

Think any ERP system (SAP, Oracle, etc.) which is basically a CRUD app on steroids.  If your company doesn&#x27;t make ERP systems then you want the lowest skilled bidder doing the work. Is that the case for a tech startup?<p>It also requires almost the same count of people to offshore the work as it does to do it yourself.  You need someone who can interface with the offshore team, answer questions about requirements (if they are even asked), etc.  And deal with turnover.<p>You might be asking why any sane company would do this then?  Simply cost but also accounting rules.  When a company buys a service from another vendor (like buying bandwidth) I think it shows up differently on the books than when they have an entire department of people doing that work.  That entire department needs to have retirement plans, benefits, vacation time, etc. and they show up in the employee count reported to shareholders.

I have seen testing done well, and testing done poorly.  And in light of the latter, I can see why someone might dismiss developer testing.  Having both as a basis of comparison, the shop that used TDD accomplished a task in two months with 3 people that the other shop could never have accomplished in 2 whole years with 15 people.<p>The bad shop mandated testing, of course, as a cargo cult ritual, but metaphorically, in order to test the shear strength of a single bolt, you had to launch the whole Space Shuttle.  I often saw methods written with a boolean parameter called IsUnitTest.  I am not making this up.<p>That was a clear difference between smart-lazy and stupid-lazy.  One shop sharpened the axe before cutting, and it was felled on time.  The other held several hour-long meetings, decided to cut down the tree with a rubber mallet, declared that it would take about 20 minutes, and assigned the task to me entirely without my input.  When I suggested an axe would work better, I was told that the mallet was already decided, and if I used an axe instead, I would be fired.  When it was later discovered that I used the mallet to strike a splitting wedge, I was deemed to be undermining the axeless mandate, and was fired.<p>This is metaphor, but there is no hyperbole.  This was the shop that banned me from using lambda expressions in C#, because other developers on the team could not understand them.  In 2014.<p>Be smart-lazy.  Do the simplest thing that will get the job done.  If automated tests do not make your job easier in the long run, don&#x27;t do them.

I was arguing with him over git vs hg yesterday, and this blog post is obviously his retort. Here is my defence of Mercurial:<p>Mercurial’s design aims to welcome people who come from other VCSes. It started being welcoming to CVS and SVN users, and its CLI mimicked those, as well, as a few ideas of Bitkeeper. Git’s initial design was very bitkeeper-like too, such as branching-by-cloning being the only way to branch. Nowadays, Mercurial also makes some concessions to git users.<p>Despite its various sources of inspiration, Mercurial works hard to keep all of these ideas consistent. Commands rarely grow new options. Many deviations from core functionality are first tested in optional extensions for a long time before going into the core. Lots of time is spent bikeshedding what a command’s name should be, and what language the documentation should use. Consistency is very important. Backwards compatibility is tantamount. The CLI is the UI and the API.<p>A thing git is often lauded for is the simplicity of its internals, which are frequently deemed to be as simple as to not be internal at all. Despite being a binary format, Mercurial’s revlogs are also approximately simple, which is why people sometimes write parsers in other languages.<p>But Mercurial is a lot more than just git-with-a-nicer-UI. There are many exciting features in Mercurial, features that I don’t think will ever make it into git because they are just too different from the way git works. Mercurial Evolve really changes the way we collaboratively edit commits. Templates and revsets can be combined to program interesting extensions. New extensions can scale Mercurial into gigantic repos.<p>And because I think these ideas are so great and must be explored and improved, I will keep using Mercurial, teaching Mercurial, and improving Mercurial",1424197388

With the ongoing increase in programmers who learn a programming language at the same time as they&#x27;re paid to write production code in it, the promoters of some languages will inevitably skip writing documentation that fully describes what it does and instead set up a basket of Stack Overflow users to plant lots of answered questions, which also gives the initial appearance of an existing community for that language. Eventually languages will even be designed and implemented without any thought given to documentation that explains it from beginning to end, but instead only the intention for it to be learnt in Stack Overflow-sized chunks, keyed to search engine keywords instead of documentation subheadings. And part of Stack Overflow&#x27;s business model may be to host the primary documentation for these emerging types of programming languages.<p>Dr Dobbs magazine described this phenomenon as a &quot;conundrum&quot; and used Groovy as an example of this new type of language: &quot;<i>The endless variety of features requires considerable documentation, which is simply not available, especially for the advanced features that give Groovy much of its benefit.

That on its own is enough to provide useful power to everyone sure we would not be using it for home heating but lighting, computers, and refrigeration would easily make the cut even if AC would be far too expensive for most people. aka, most people get a setback but not to the dark ages.  Toss in just wind power and you could meet the world’s electricity needs at perhaps a 10-30% increase in electricity costs.<p>In the end there is a huge inertia in the current system; dropping coal in say 10 years would be possible, but ridiculously expensive.

With inotify i use one watch per-folder, with kqueue you need to do it by file ( of course you can watch the folder changes, but you need to keep a copy of the file states in that folder, and then re-stat that files to find out what file was changed, not even close to an ideal solution ).

I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s wrong, I&#x27;m just curious about where and how the deaths are occurring.<p>Coal kills in three distinct ways:<p>1) Miners: This depends enormously on the country and the mining technology. The trend in North America is toward fewer and fewer miners underground. I&#x27;ve worked in a support industry for hard rock mining, and coal is fundamentally different in a lot of ways, but in hard rock the push is toward &quot;zero entry&quot; mining, where everything underground is teleoperated or simply autonomous.<p>2) Transport: Coal has to be moved via train and truck, and the average thermal coal plant requires a boxcar load every fifteen minutes. This is one of the things that makes nuclear so much safer: uranium has such high energy density that transportation deaths are very nearly zero. Mining deaths are lower too.<p>3) Pollution: This is where coal really falls down. It&#x27;s full of heavy metals--lead, mercury, arsenic--and governed by standards that let coal plants release more radioactivity into the environment than nuclear plants. Particulates cause premature death due to respiratory disease. On the good side, they may be cutting global climate change by more than half (1 W/m<i></i>2 cooling due to particulates vs 1.6 W/m<i></i>2 warming due to CO2).<p>Oil in contrast seems like it ought to be relatively safe. Drilling, refining and pipeline transport rarely kill people. Rail transport--brought to you by people who hate pipelines but love cars and electricity but oppose nuclear, solar and windmills--is far more dangerous but it would be surprising if it was that much worse than coal.<p>Here are some alternative data with some discussion of different sources and studies: <a href=""http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-so...</a> (coal and oil are both still pretty bad compared to nuclear, but we knew that anyway: nuclear is overwhelmingly the safest way to generate electricity, despite its likely preventable issues with economically catastrophic failure.)",1424196203

So is pulling the occasional all-nighter to meet a deadline.<p>The article is talking about something completely different: putting yourself in a state of constant sleep-deprivation through working ridiculous hours. And the author is right: that's not half as effective as people claim.",1209725781

179363,comment,179259,179259,0,0,signa11,,,"i guess, i would get rid of windows os-core, replace it with linux/bsd (more likely) and provide a nice skin on top. this would most likely destroy all hopes of having linux / osx having any resonable dominance on the desktop anytime soon. and a unix-y core would be quite welcome among the hackers too. world-domination with a vengeance :o)<p>edit: one thing that i realized is that _is_ possible to dress unix up quite nicely. an iron fist with a velvet glove.",1209725171
179360,comment,177865,179067,0,0,mojuba,,,"<i>I wonder if this will end up having any impact on how computers look to the programmer.</i><p>RAM is nothing more than just a cache mechanism for slower storage devices, and as such it could have been made transparent from the programming perspective (roughly the same way as other caching devices - Cache Level 1 ... Cache Level N, CPU registers).<p>The reasons RAM is still directly programmable are probably historical rather than technical. There is clearly a tendency though in many modern dynamic languages to hide direct memory allocation from the programmer.<p>So, my first guess is, memristors won't affect much the world of garbage-collected dynamic languages - they are sort of ahead of time already.<p>There is an interesting perspective, however, if you look at the OS level.<p>Firstly, some part of the file system which is read-only - mostly code - will not be copied or ""loaded"" anymore, it will be read directly by the CPU from where it lies in the FS.<p>Another important change here would be that memory pointers will persist. It is difficult to speculate on the possible impact, but it may be huge. It may even give rise to new programming languages - with or without direct pointer manipulation, I don't know.<p>As for data files, my guess is that ""open"", ""save"" and other common verbs will be eliminated. Instead, we'll work directly on the file and the system will somehow keep the modification history (and here's where the analog nature of memristors might help, or maybe not).",1209724129

There are three big unknowns as I see it:<p>-Nobody really knows the details of the offer.<p>-Nobody really knows what Xobni has in store.<p>-Nobody really knows how much say the VC's had.<p>Most companies start with a feature that becomes a product which becomes a company.  The Outlook plugin could be the tip of a much bigger spear.  I have never used xobni b/c I don't use outlook but I can see a bunch of possible directions for them.  Who knows though?  Maybe it is a minor feature.  But anyone in a startup knows enough to know how little they know about the inner workings of another company.  And anyone who's tried to raise money knows how thoroughly you have to explain your long term plans and revenue models.  If you can't say I'm going to be a $100 million dollar company in X years b/c of Y and Z reasons, you're not going to get a series A.  You'd also know that $20 million is a small offer after a series A.",1209722666

57971,comment,57868,57927,0,0,mojuba,,,"Philosophically speaking, we live in a world where the number of spaces doesn't matter anymore (although it did matter in those pre-historic pre-Internet times). Spaces may be lost in HTML, in word processors or in an editor that accidentally wasn't tuned for Python. However neat and readable it is, just try to show your code, for example, on some minimalist web forum like this one. It's too bad you can't, isn't it?<p>It is also true that Python has survived already, but I doubt this concept would leak to new languages.<p><i>Upd</i>: In other words, it's electronic typography that made the space character irrelevant.",1190390366

Your best bet is probably working through an evangelical school like Liberty University. ",1190389640

It's likely that before (or during) the first meeting the VC will have identified several key concerns that could end their interest in your venture.  These could be the competitive threat, the addressable market size, the likelihood of acquiring partnerships or a variety of other topics. \n",1190388651
57962,comment,57868,57945,0,0,brlewis,,,"That syntax looks like it's intended to communicate that f(x) is the normal result, and g(y) is exceptional.  I wouldn't want to use it unless that's what I intended to communicate.  It also looks like you would need to put parens around the ""if"" expression if you were to use it within a more complex expression, e.g<p><pre><code> 2 + (f(x) if a else g(y)) + 3\n</code></pre>",1190388646

Can you imagine a Joe Shmoe VC putting a lesser amount of money into the Google Series B round ( when the company was worth 75m)  because the tax rate was high. That is absurd. Many VC's have clauses in their contracts where they decide what their rate of return should be. In the event of higher taxes the greedy ones will simply increase the rate of return in their contracts. \n",1190388171

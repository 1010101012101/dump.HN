329601,comment,329448,329448,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"This is simply ridiculous. The author clearly hasn't filled out IRS Form 1120S lately, or any other tax form that actually might be applicable to entrepreneurs. Furthermore, I don't really care if angel investors and venture capitalists have to pay more taxes on their successful investments. There's a difference between investing and inventing.<p>In regard to health care, adding more tax incentives (read loopholes), thereby increasing the complexity of the laws, and making the market for health insurance ""more competitive,"" when the lack of competition is not the problem in the first place, will make matters far worse. Health care is not a commodity that lends itself to a market. It's a human right, which lends itself far better to [competent] government.<p>A while back I wrote about some of these issues here:<p><a href=""http://www.aarongreenspan.com/essays/index.html?id=11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aarongreenspan.com/essays/index.html?id=11</a>",1223714975

329596,comment,329152,329152,0,0,ardit33,,,"I see it over and over in engineering,  novices get tangled in the details, and don't step back to look at the bigger picture.<p>Ineffective programmers sweat the little details, and tend either tend to spend too much time on them, or solve them in such a way (usually isolated), that it hurts the design of the whole system, and shoot themselves in the foot for later one.
Usually this is manifested in spaghetti code, or over-complicated engineering of things that should be simple.<p>While an experienced programmer, sees them as details that have to be solved, but without loosing touch of the bigger picture.",1223714213
329595,comment,329262,329262,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"The problem in both cited cases was that the employee had the ability to give discounts. This is shocking. At most major retailers, only supervisors have that ability, and even there, they show up in audit forms that someone would see.<p>Neither is really a case of an incentive being gamed so much as lax security procedures. Simple auditing can sniff those out, and they're clearly violations of company rules over which the employee can be disciplined and probably fired, as per Joel's incentive plan.<p>On the whole, not a very good article.",1223714111

For every house that is in foreclosure, every house/street/building that is left half build,  that is all economic loss to all.<p>While it is a good idea to let markets decide private investments in the long run, sometimes it is necessary for the government to step in, and invest in things that are not profitable in the short term, but have huge positive economic impact in the long run.   And if pinching some money away from the private market is necessary, so be it.",1223713556

Instead, it was nearly wall-to-wall non sequiturs and faulty generalizations.<p>There's some arm waving about how increasing the income tax on high wage earners will act as a disincentive to angel investors. Am I misunderstanding tax law, or aren't capital gains (e.g., from startup investments) separate from income for tax purposes?<p>Then, when Obama's ""socialized medicine"" plan would actually help, the author rails against it because it has 'failed everywhere it's been tried.' (Except where it has succeeded. And also, the dismal failures mentioned are anecdotal scaremongering.) <i>The solution is held out in front of the author and he rejects it on unrelated, partisan grounds!</i><p>Maybe he makes sense to himself, but his oversimplifications haven't adequately made the case for the article title or his two supporting gripes.",1223713121

You have to make really good guesstimate on what the E will be in the future before you can determine whether it is cheap.<p>There's a lot of danger in picking stocks based on P/E.

You bought $10,000 worth of Jan 2010 MS 5 call options at $7 each.<p>Scenario 1: MS gets nationalized or goes bankrupt
Action 1: You would have lost almost all of your $100,000 investment.
Action 2: If you hold out until your bond mature, you'll get back your $100,000 principal after 1 year. Your options is worthless.<p>Scenario 2: MS goes up to $30
Action 1: Your investment is now worth $300,000
Action 2: You get $100,000 from your bonds and your $7 options is now worth $18. So your investment is worth $125,000.<p>So Action 1 is very volatile and risky. Your profit range from -100% to 200%.<p>Action 2 allows you to sleep soundly at night, even during current market conditions. Your profit range from 0% to 25%.

In their market (medical insurance) they are the largest players. Absolutely. As a result, other insurance companies structure their plans within those offered by these two entities.

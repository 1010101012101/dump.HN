486485,comment,485830,486405,0,0,unalone,,,"<i>Or maybe someone can explain to me why helping people break the law should be legal.</i><p>Does Google break the law because it makes it easy for me to search for mp3s to download? Or are they providing a useful service, and in doing do creating functionality that makes it possible to do illegal things?<p>ThePirateBay is an extension of that idea: if you make a service, even if that service breaks laws <i>you</i> are not to blame. And TPB is pretty much at the limit of that: they mock the people who've been stolen, they openly admit they help pirates - and yet, they themselves have done nothing wrong. They provide a service. They're allowed to call attention to the laws broken by their <i>users</i> and it's still not breaking the law.<p><i>Arguing minutiae might be a good way to win in court.</i><p>It's not minutiae. I find it a pretty repugnant attitude, this assumption that things ought to be black-and-white simple. <i>They haven't broken the law.</i> That's why they're winning. It's like this: if somebody asks me where they can download an album for free, because I know and they don't, if I tell them I'm not breaking the law. I'm merely being useful. That's what TPB's done. They don't steal movies. They don't host stolen content. They merely make it easy for people to find it, and that's shady, but not illegal.<p><i>But outside of court, the term ""legalistic"" has a negative connotation.</i><p>For me, ""legalistic"" has a pretty positive connotation. It implies that there's thought behind a process, and that logic is being used. It's a lot better than ""impulsive judgement,"" which is what you're using. You don't defend your points. You just assume that they're bad and wrong and that we're all stupid to be defending it - that <i>despite</i> the many, many stories posted here that explain very specifically the rights that ThePirateBay has.<p><i>I don't understand why they seem to convinced so many people with such a legalistic defense.</i><p>Partly because a lot of us like free stuff, yes. But partly it's because a lot of people care about this stuff, and we think the RIAA is just as shady as ThePirateBay, and we want to see a new method come in that <i>doesn't</i> allow a bunch of legal-minded people with no appreciation for music and music distribution to cheat bands out of money, to deny a lot of musicians the right to profit, and to pursue draconic punishments for the people who speak out against them.",1235004990

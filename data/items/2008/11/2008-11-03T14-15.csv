i'm not sure why anyone reads this blog. it's not the least bit creative (negative humor is second only to fat jokes in terms of lack of originality). and does anyone here feel good after reading posts like this? does it improve your day in <i>any</i> way? do you feel better equipped to change the world after a visit to uncov?<p>there is so much negativity in this world already and, if you're really craving it, i'd suggest reading about people fleeing for their lives in the congo and think to yourself that those people may never experience a day in their entire lifetime where they feel safe -- a feeling we take for granted.<p>investing negative reading time on a stupid rant about some guy getting a college degree and worrying about a job when CS people NEVER have to worry about jobs, is pathetic. now, if he were a 45 year old career factory line worker who just got laid off, then perhaps he would have a reason to pen such a piece.<p>if you think that, in some way, uncov plays an important role in your life, helps you to become a better hacker, improves your relationships with and respect for other humans, and makes it easier to face each day, then feel free to demote my post to prove me wrong.

Stubbing our toes, becoming alcoholic, dying during childbirth... these are things which are just incidental consequences of how our bodies are built.<p>I suspect religion is ""natural"" in the same sense. We're born with a sense of cause and effect, so when we see effects we hypothesise causes.

For instance, I think the type system of Haskell (combined with its purely functional nature) is a powerful abstraction technique not present in most languages. I'd like to hear what you think is missing from Lisp that makes it less powerful than other programming languages!<p><i>It ignores Noam Chomsky and a large amount of research and development in linguistics and CS that goes way back to the 1950's.</i><p>Could you please explain? I've read some of Noam Chomsky's stuff but haven't touched his linguistic material much (I intend to though). Keep in mind if you're going to call it ""Blub"", it helps your point if you play by the rules of the original Blub thought experiment. Namely, you probably should provide a language which is more powerful (see my response to your last point).<p><i>Sometimes I wonder if the MIT CS department was so hot on LISP in the 1970's as a way to spite Noam Chomsky for biting the hand that feeds them (DOD research $.)</i><p>This seems like a far-out conspiracy theory, but I wouldn't know if it's true or not.<p><i>Funny, modern work on machine understanding of language is pointing more and more to the primitive ""markov chain"" sort of models that Chomsky rejected in the 1950s; simple experiments prove that humans don't have recursive (LISP-like) mental models of language (or anything else) -- actually, ALGOL-type languages, much closer to natural languages, are a much better match for the human brain.</i><p>So the use of recursion makes the language less powerful because it isn't close to writing a human language (recursion is pretty relevant to a lot of activities, whether you realize it or not, but I'll play along)? I think from this discussion you can ask an interesting question: if you have a language with less abstraction ability that is more intuitive to use than a competitor, is it actually more powerful? So (playing along with what you wrote, not saying I agree) is Python better than Lisp because, despite the fact that it lacks some abstraction techniques of Lisp, it is easier to write? Doesn't that whole house of cards collapse when you realize there are:<p>a) human languages which syntactically and semantically probably don't resemble anything ALGOL-ish<p>and<p>b) there are people like me who find Lisp much more natural than Python<p>Despite the fact that part of your comment sounds absolutely crazy, I think there are tidbits in there that can provoke an interesting discussion.

That's pretty obvious. And no my mind does not need widening on this point. Everything I've read so far in this thread where somebody thinks they are enlightening has not revealed something I didn't already know. Instead, I seem to be getting persecuted here karma-wise, in a sense, because some HN'ers are attributing viewpoints to me that I do not have, nor have I claimed to have. It would be funny if it were not so frustrating and lame. For example, to be real clear: I do not think homosexuals are bad people. And I think pedophiles are mentally sick, in a way, at a bare minimum, and sometimes can also be morally evil, depending on the particulars. And I do not think all pedophiles are homosexuals or vice versa. So I don't understand why some folks, if they really read what I said strictly, get miffed.<p>What my original comment, at the head of this thread, was alluding to, in the real world, is the issue where it seems a rather large number of Catholic priests seem to be either (1) gay, or (2) pedophiles, or (3) both. Are all? Of course not. And of course every situation is different. If a middle-aged priest has sex with a 17-year old altar boy, or whatever, then yes by the official psychological definition he is not necessarily a pedophile. But from a legal standpoint, it's an adult involved with a minor, and the media coverage and community reaction around that will blur into it being an adult with a ""child"", and with the courts now labeling them, in many jurisdictions, as a sex offender. Which then means he is given the fuzzy and technically innacurate, laymen's label of ""a pedophile"". I'm confident in predicting that a significant percentage of Americans at least would consider a 40/17-year old sex encounter as pedophilia, regardless of whether that is the official definition or not.<p>Also, I ask all HN'ers to stay polite. We should all write here as if we were conversing with someone face-to-face in the same room. Thanks and this has been a public service announcement. :P",1276827706

Thus, we invented prayer to try to change the far future (i.e. long-term weather conditions—due to the large intervening period, it wasn't obvious whether it worked or not in any given instance, so we assumed it did), and commandments to justify our right to static resources, or our reasoning for pillaging them.

I can get billions of req/sec if I have billions of dollars.  What scalability should be is getting as much as you can performance/stability wise with the least amount of money.<p>With that being said, the plan is that since all backends and frontends can talk using arbitrary types of 0MQ sockets, and 0MQ provides for any kind of network layout, you can make it as ""no single point of failure"" as you have money to burn on.  In my tests so far it's incredibly trivial to have 10 mongrel2 servers submitting requests using a subscribed UUID, and then have 20 backends servicing those requests and replying as needed.  Since both the frontends and backends are just using basic messaging with subscribed queues it's fairly easy to get them to talk without any one of them being the point of failure.<p>Of course, with this comes a configuration penalty which I have to figure out.  Either the backends then have to know where all the frontends are (probably easiest) or the frontends have to know about backends.  I still haven't got that worked out, but again, it's fairly trivial to create a ""registration"" service where newly minted backends/frontends announce themselves.<p>Finally, all of these things have been solved no problem.  The easiest answer is I'll just figure out how other people have done it and copy them.  It's not like this is new territory or anything.  The question itself is kind of stupid because you're saying, for some reason, 0mq precludes my ability to use any existing best practice architecture, when really they're orthogonal <i>and</i> I'm not just using 0mq.<p>tl;dr: The way everyone fucking does it.",1276827347

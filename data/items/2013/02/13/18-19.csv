This makes sense for certain specific cases.<p>For startups that need this power, hosting at home can save money. Also you can't beat the security of having physical access and control of your hardware.<p>For my app streamjoy.tv I run all the intensive tasks on a core i7 at home and then just push the rendered results to a $5 a month digital ocean vps.<p>For the kind of computation that I am doing it is much less expensive and faster to use my local hardware and push static pages to my nginx server at digital ocean.<p>If I had a 1gbps connection I would run even more of my setup at home.

5214831,comment,5212543,5214591,1,0,lutusp,,,"> The cicada simulation on that page is very misleading.<p>Not at all.<p>> You're only seeing prime numbers because you arbitrarily synchronized the cycles of the cicada and the predators at t=0.<p>Not true. Because of how the math works out, the starting time is irrelevant. Any arbitrary starting times for both the cicadas and predators yields the same outcome over time, because the filtering effect of prime reproductive cycles depends on synchronizing (or not synchronizing) random reproductive <i>periods</i>, not starting points.<p>Just so you won't think this is all rhetoric, and to do your homework for you, here's a short Python program that accepts any starting value and produces the same result regardless of the chosen starting point:<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/7m8hq9yzcu5nztx/prime_reproduction_test.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/7m8hq9yzcu5nztx/prime_reproduction...</a><p>Here is a typical output (the output changes in small ways with the chosen starting number, but always favors primes over composites):<p><pre><code>     2 =   6901 *********************\n     3 =   6395 *******************\n     4 =   9036 ****************************\n     5 =   5836 ******************\n     6 =  11030 **********************************\n     7 =   5468 *****************\n     8 =  10410 ********************************\n     9 =   7643 ***********************\n    10 =   9923 *******************************\n    11 =   4987 ***************\n    12 =  14110 ********************************************\n    13 =   4810 ***************\n    14 =   9199 ****************************\n    15 =   8988 ****************************\n    16 =  11051 **********************************\n    17 =   4528 **************\n    18 =  12797 ***************************************\n    19 =   4414 *************\n    20 =  12469 **************************************\n    21 =   8273 *************************\n    22 =   8251 *************************\n    23 =   4219 *************\n\n\n</code></pre>\n> If you had chosen another starting point at t=0 ...<p>See above. You're mistaken. If you had tested your idea using actual mathematics, you would have realized your mistake before posting. But this would require a respect for validating one's ideas before posting them.<p>The effect being described counts only synchronization events between two reproductive cycles A and B over a long period of time. In this case, a given prime number A is compared to any number of values for B, and the number of synchronizations is totaled. As it happens, and regardless of the starting times, when a prime number in A is compared to a large range of values in B, and not surprisingly, the number of synchronizations is smallest if A is prime.<p>Another way of saying this is that a prime number has fewer factors than a composite number, hardly a controversial claim, and one that doesn't depend on the starting values for the counters.<p>> From somebody who criticizes psychology for wrong methodology ...<p>Ah, yes, the real reason for your post. I have never criticized psychology for ""wrong methodology"" anywhere. I criticize the field for not being scientific, as does the sitting director of the NIMH and many, many others.

(Though I add the caveat that this is just speculation on my part.) I certainly see a Trekkie answer to your concerns, anyway, you just have to swallow the sci-fi for a moment. ;) That hypothetical 24th century isn't such a bad place to live, at least compared to 21st century Earth. (My major beef with it is that people still die. Death isn't that hard of a problem, especially when you have teleporters!) In the 24th century, many humans still do purposeful work to better themselves and better humanity. Those that don't work live unexciting lives on some unknown colony planet, but so long as the Borg et al. don't attack, they can live their longer lives in peace and comfort, free of charge. Energy isn't free even in the Star Trek universe, but the society has moved beyond requiring people to toil for money in order to live. Such non-toiling has its costs, of course. Not every slacker can have their own galaxy class ship.<p>In essence, with such technology, and with such a culture of ""it's okay for people to be useless and their marginal cost for the Federation to support is close to 0 so why not"", it's not that hard to see how they can get rid of money. They still have de-facto currency and capital, though. e.g. natural dilithium is a common source of conflict among the space-faring races. But such sources of capital typically have instrumental value apart from being able to get other stuff with it.<p>This is all sci-fi speculation, though it can be useful to postulate various technologies existing and try and guess how humanity might be changed. I'll leave you with a simplified form of a particularly hairy one that some very smart people are spending their lives on right now. Will they succeed by 2100? 2500? Via I.J. Good:<p>""Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ""intelligence explosion,"" and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.""",1360780314

The site in question was using the free version of CloudFlare's service. On February 2, 2013, the site came under a substantial Layer 7 DDoS attack. While we provide basic DDoS mitigation for all customers (even those on the Free CloudFlare plan), for the mitigation of large attacks a site needs at least the Business tier of CloudFlare's service. In an effort to keep the site online, our ops team enabled I'm Under Attack Mode, which is available for Free customers and enhances DDoS protection.<p>The attack continued and began to affect the performance of other CloudFlare customers, at which point we routed traffic to the site away from our network. While we encouraged the site owner to take advantage of the Enterprise tier of service given their needs and traffic levels, the site would have been brought back onto CloudFlare's network if they had upgraded to the Business tier of service ($200/mo) which included Advanced DDoS mitigation.<p>To be clear, CloudFlare does not bill based on traffic. However, resources are not infinite and when an attack against a Free customer begins to affect the performance of other customers we will take measures to protect the overall integrity of the CloudFlare service.<p>Matthew Prince, CEO, CloudFlare, @eastdakota (Twitter)",1360780168

That's not a document. That's an application. Each tweet in the interface is a document. Every tweet in that feed is a document that has been ""transcluded"" into the app Twitter built on top of  a document. There needs to be a standard way to ""transclude"" documents with reference URL that allows interactivity. The fact that the only hyperlinking option we have today is the <a> tag is unfortunate. There need to be more ways of hyperlinking than an <a> tag. You need to be able to window directly to a document or document fragment at a different URL. The #hashanchors aren't sufficient, since they only describe a beginning, not an end to the fragment being excerpt. iFrames kind of provide an alternative, but this was never explored properly. The host app should also be able to provide a cached copy of the contents of any sub-document for performance and to guarantee that a copy of the referred document is always available in the parent context.<p>edit: downvote? srsly? without a response? downvoting is for comments that don't contribute to the conversation, not for comments you simply don't agree with.",1360779401

In my view, once a ""model code"" is adopted into law by the government, a private entity, such as SBCCI, may no longer obstruct publication and transmission of the law by an uncompensated transferor. Adoption of the model code as law serves to place the law in the public domain and it should, therefore, be readily available for access by all citizens. The access should not be limited to a non-public commercial establishment. Similarly, upon enactment, the law transforms into an ""idea"" that is no longer distinguishable from its expression, causing SBCCI's codes to lose their copyright protection. It is my belief that reversal of the district court judgment is appropriate. I respectfully dissent from the decision of the majority.<p>edit: later noticed btilly's link to SBCCI vs Veeck <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5214449"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5214449</a> at <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/293_F3d_791.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/293_F3d_791.htm</a>",1360779215

The original hardware profile (PC-like so tools were available) and including a HDD was what allowed us to get game developers on-board quickly. Including the HDD and the NIC were also the bets, and as I tried to say in my original post, these were the innovations and the bets on the living-room Trojan horse -- we could afford to include these things because the console business model involved an audience size, a higher bill-of-material and a payback model which things like set-top-boxes and WebTV did not.\nSecuring a few awesome first- and second-/third-party games exclusively to the console was also a critical tactic early on.

When I think about things I've done wrong, I go through this process.  Then when I try to explain to people, I go through this process.  However, when I do this, I fear that other people think I'm just trying to justify my mistakes.<p>As such, I don't often try to explain myself to others.  I apologize, but I don't go into detail; and usually, people are willing to accept simply the apology and the high-level explanation.  When I say go into detail, I mean a truly blow by blow account of every premise, piece of context, and minor decision that led to the big one.  I think part of it is that a lot of people simply don't have the patience for such details.<p>To clarify what I'm talking about in terms of level of detail, I give the example of a time a girl asked me, ""So do you prefer Vancouver food or Hong Kong food?"".  And I responded with a 5 minute dissection of the question to better understand what the question was asking, because the answer could vary depending on the question's true meaning and intent.  Then she got exasperated and said, ""Wow, I just asked you whether you prefer this food or that food!!! What's the big deal???"")<p>So maybe I have two fears when I want to give the blow by blow account.  The stupid fear is that people will think I'm crazy for going into such detail.  The more scary fear is that people will think I'm trying to justify myself when I'm in fact not trying to do that at all.  And this fear keeps me from sharing my thoughts with others.<p>I have no idea whether this guy is sincere or not, and so it's funny that the fear I have regarding other people being suspicious of my sincerity, I am casting similar suspicions (though not aggressively, as it's not a significant event to me whether or not this guy is sincere).",1360778791

5214576,comment,5214480,5214480,46,0,kevingadd,,,"On the one hand, I think it's insane that you hit 100TB/mo of usage on a ""free"" service and expected it to keep going. Maybe you figured you wouldn't rock the boat as long as it was free - I guess I can relate. But still, really???<p>On the other hand: CloudFlare comes off as terrifyingly incompetent here - which more or less matches with my experiences trying them out on a site serving maybe 100GB worth of traffic at most in a month. They seem to have missed dozens of great opportunities to upsell you on their paid service, and when someone finally noticed how much bandwidth you were using, they completely lost the plot.<p>What should have happened, IMO, is something like this: A panicked CloudFlare admin realizes your site is using 100TB/mo. Their first step is to send you a sternly worded email, explaining that for this usage level you need plan X, and if you don't upgrade within... let's say 5, maybe 7 days? They'll be throttling or limiting your service. Then you don't feel pressured to solve the problem <i>right away</i>, and they are trying to retain a customer that (presumably) they value.<p>Instead, they haphazardly change your settings behind your back (???) and then later take various steps to reduce your bandwidth usage before finally deciding that you need to pay them, without even figuring out how much money they want. Ridiculous.<p>To me this just says that CloudFlare is running on what may be a fundamentally unsound business model, and that by claiming their free tier doesn't charge by bandwidth (and not listing any limits) they're dramatically increasing the odds that customers will suddenly discover there are limits after all, and leave. If they were more up front about what the actual pricing structure is, it'd probably be more likely that people would start paying for the value that CloudFlare gives them.",1360778714

No, since Apple actively prevents ""alternative"" visions of what the web should be since they just don't allow custom builds of WebKit/JS on there. Any browser you make can only add superficial features, forcing you to use the built in WebKit. You may have a great idea that would instantly make everyone want to use web apps on iOS instead of native apps, but since you 1) can't ship that browser on iOS, and 2) can't convince Apple to commit that change to WebKit proper, you are effectively locked out.<p>Compare this to a plugin-driven environment vs a standards-driven environment.

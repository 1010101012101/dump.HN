So far all I've done was a few Euler problems and played with some Java interop (Swing graphics and so on) but it's been a worthwhile experience.",1262425748

Programs don't need to be fast as possible, they just need to be fast enough.",1262425601

I normally fry on 7 (out of 10). Mix the eggs. Add half the milk. Add the flour. Whisk together until smooth. Add the sugar, salt and remainder of the milk. Add the oil. Mix until the batter is smooth.<p>About now the pans should be warm. Put a tea spoon of butter in each pan, spread it out in the pan. Add about a cup of batter (or so) to each pan. When the batter is congealed on the top of the pancake, use a long thin spatula to turn the pancake over. It should be yellow/golden brown on the fried side. Wait a minute. The pancake is done. Repeat from beginning of paragraph until out of batter.<p>Serve with sweats or savoury as you prefer. Blueberries, ice cream, sugar and butter, strawberry jam, are my favourite toppings.<p>All in all you can do this, with a bit of practice, from a standing start in 20 minutes. And the pancakes are superior to anything you will buy in a pack or a box. Promise.<p>Notes:<p>1) can easily be scaled to fit, 1 egg = 2 dl milk = 1 dl flour<p>2) dl = decilitre 1/10 litre (about a small coffee cup)",1262424899

Anderson - I'm not recommending this one on the basis of the writing.  I'd recommend it only to those who read all of Frank Herbert's original Dune series and have been hanging in suspense ever since because the cliffhanger ending of Chapterhouse Dune was never resolved due to Frank's untimely death.  They based the book on Frank's outline, but it clearly would have been a better book if it had been written by Frank.  Nonetheless, it is satisfying to resolve the unanswered questions:  Who the heck are these Honored Matres and what were they running away from?<p><i>Labyrinths:  Selected Stories & Other Writings</i>, by Jorges Luis Borges - This is kind of a quirky collection of short stories that are all mindbenders of one variety or another.  The best description I can give of Borges is that reading him is kind of like solving puzzles.<p><i>Across the Nightingale Floor:  Tales of the Otori</i>, by Lain Hearn - Historical fiction set in feudal Japan with lords and their retainers, assassins, etc.<p><i>The Lost Symbol</i>, by Dan Brown - If you liked The Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons, you'll probably like this one as well.  While Dan Brown will probably never write anything that matches the utter genius of Umberto Eco's <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i>, he is entertaining in his own way and worth a read.",1262423866

I'm curious--I haven't used it myself, but a client of mine is using it in a very latency-sensitive Java applet that uses JNI to call libavcodec to decode a video stream and then immediately display it through Java's own native libraries, so I would think the cost isn't <i>that</i> high.",1262423722

It simply doesn&#x27;t scale for that.<p>Bitcoin, with the current block size of 1 MB, can handle a maximum of 7 transactions per second (about 600k per day). Facebook supposedly get 2.7 billion likes per day. To scale to handling that many transactions, bitcoin would either need to increase the block size to 4.5 GB or be completely re-architectured.",1432925901

9626570,comment,9625994,9625994,0,0,crdb,,,"Make stuff relevant to the places you want to work. It&#x27;s both a signal of competence and of drive and caring about that place.<p>For example, assuming a data science team in an e-commerce retailer is hiring a Python dev: crawl their site, grab the relevant attributes (category, gender, name, price, discount), then upload a graphical, interactive representation of their inventory and a short analysis of their price structure. Do so on a page hosted on your own server (like a free AWS micro instance + $5/year for domain), then stick the code on a private repo which you share with the person you get in touch with ($7/month for 5 on Github).<p>You&#x27;ve just demonstrated both technical competence over the whole ecosystem, and that you are at least aware of the &quot;business side&quot;. You&#x27;ve also probably done more than 99% of candidates for the position.<p>Recent example: I recently had a chat with a friend who explained to me a problem he had been having for 6 months getting a simple web tool up and running for his business. My co-founder and I knocked out a working prototype in 2 hours and sent him the link. He signed us up immediately.<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot of less technically literate folks out there who need some work done. Think your local tailor, restaurant, whatever. You can try ask them about it and present some solutions, and some might end up paying you. It&#x27;s a start, allows you to say you put something in production.",1432925897

Supposing that an employee is producing $50/hour of value, their employer could afford much more than $15/hour without losing money, but most will choose not to because they have no compelling reason to do so.<p>There are, of course, marginal roles and not-very-profitable businesses where the value of an employee is pretty close to the minimum wage.",1432925873

9626564,comment,9625994,9625994,0,0,ThrustVectoring,,,">I am really struggling with getting my foot through the door, as there is the typical catch 22 scenario, &quot;We can&#x27;t take you on board as you do not have Production centric experience&quot;<p>How many applications and feelers are you sending out? The vast majority of companies are either unwilling to risk hiring a junior developer, or don&#x27;t have the on-boarding and infrastructure to make use of them. With excellent set-up, you should still expect to see fewer than one in twenty companies get back to you. The application game sucks, but it&#x27;s how you find the companies that can hire junior developers.<p>Where in the interviewing pipeline are you getting this? The best course of action is very dependent on where you&#x27;re getting rejected.<p>My model of the pipeline:\n1. Initial contact\n2. Phone screen\n3. Technical or coding challenge\n4. On-site interview\n5. Offer & salary negotiations<p>So, there&#x27;s five different pieces of advice:<p>1. If you&#x27;ve sent out a hundred resumes and have gotten zero phone screens, I recommend working on your resume and on-paper skills. The good news is that a hundred applications like that takes 5-10 hours depending on skill and organization. Advice: make a couple small open-source web applications, and put them on the very top of your resume.<p>2. If you&#x27;ve gotten five phone screens and no technical challenges or on-sites, I recommend brushing up on self-presentation skills. Figure out a quick, one-minute story to tell about who you are and why you&#x27;re an awesome self-taught programmer. Also, you could check how you&#x27;re talking about yourself, and try to find areas where you&#x27;re convincing people to not hire you. Self deprecating talk about lack of production experience is playing defense, not offense. Your job is offense, not defense.<p>3. Coding challenges are basically something you can cram for. There&#x27;s programming competitions to get domain-specific expertise here. I don&#x27;t have good advice since this is personally an area of natural strength. Project Euler is awesome and a great fit for Python. Challenges are a mix of live shared-editor with voice and offline ones. The shared-editor stuff is higher value since there&#x27;s more commitment on their end.<p>4. Expect to fail the first one to four on-site interviews. The good news is that getting the first on-site is the most difficult. Anxiety, comfort levels, and lots of &#x27;soft&#x27; skills go into interviewing well. You improve at this best by interviewing badly. Cracking the Coding Interview is a good book to use to improve here. If you have or can form a social group for this, that&#x27;s even better.<p>On-site interviews roughly look like &quot;put candidate in room, have someone come in and give them a whiteboard problem like something from Cracking the Coding Interview, repeat three to five times.&quot; The more you can make your practice look like this, the better. I&#x27;m talking down to wearing interview clothes, keeping the practice-interviewees in the same room and rotating interviewers, etc.<p>5. Don&#x27;t worry about negotiation too much at this stage. If you must, I have some very general advice. First, ask for more time to make a decision - try for two weeks. Do not mention a number first. The only thing you need to say live is something like &quot;that&#x27;s a very interesting offer, let me think on it and get back to you.&quot; Do all negotiation over email or in rounds. Try to get multiple offers at the same time. Accepting an offer from the first company that gives you one is usually a mistake. (Why? Because someone who can get one offer can likely get three or more, there&#x27;s a large variance in fit and compensation, and you want to accept the best offer so far. Plus, as long as you don&#x27;t burn bridges, companies that have extended you an offer are willing to talk again later.)<p>tl;dr - Do you have projects and a good resume? If so, how many applications are you sending out?",1432925799

9626438,comment,9625672,9625672,0,0,c_prompt,,,"It&#x27;s hard enough to get people to try something completely different. Applying the idea of &quot;value transfer&quot; to social media isn&#x27;t just a completely foreign concept to most - it drives at the heart of a person&#x27;s philosophy.<p>When planning valME.io, which is based on your idea of value transfer [1], using bitcoin instead of karma (which is then converted to bitcoin) was considered. The problem was pricing transactions given bitcoin&#x27;s volatility might create a negative marketing image. If we were going to start suggesting a different philosophical view on social media content, we wanted to tread lightly.<p>For example, we only wanted to charge US $0.02 for a post and US $0.01 for a comment so that the barrier to entry was low and, pretty much, all profit went to the content contributor. We also wanted consistency across what an upvote and downvote meant (earning or losing US $0.01).<p>However, because so many people would likely be unfamiliar with bitcoin, it was thought the volatility would send a marketing message of unstable costs and earnings. As a blogging and forum platform targeting non-technical users who traditionally make their money via advertising, we didn&#x27;t want to dissuade them.<p>&quot;Imagine giving away a couple of cents for a funny meme, 10 cents for a video you enjoy or a dollar for an article that changed your views.If you made a video with 200.000 views and 20.000 people gave you, on average,10 cents; you would get 2000 dollars for the video.&quot;<p>We realized that, just as you said, people would want to give more than just pennies here or there. So we created karma tipping that allowed you to award someone any amount. But we used karma throughout to foster a comfortable and familiar feeling of consistency. Cashing out karma for bitcoin occurs less frequently and, thus, eases a non-technical person into it.<p>Although I agree that bitcoin makes microtransactions much more practical, the volatility and (still somewhat) limited usage makes it difficult to target non-technical users. If you use concepts they&#x27;re already familiar with (e.g., upvotes, likes, karma), and then convert to bitcoin, my belief is that it will help lower barriers.

Generally I believe that when these social network companies go public, their price-to-earnings is insanely high, meaning that in order for investors to receive value, they&#x27;d have to either hold the stock for a very long time, or be confident that the revenue will ramp up quickly enough to start making money very soon.<p>Ultimately, a VC has taken the risk that the company can be sold to &quot;someone else&quot;, whether acquisition or IPO.

They&#x27;re not in the business of creating a sustainable business, they&#x27;re in the business of taking something small and making it big.  Once they get a valuation that they feel can maximize their investment (either IPO or acquisition), they&#x27;re happy to lock in their money and move on.<p>Take Zynga or King for example.  They were revenue machines when they were close to IPO.  But investors knew the money-train was coming to a close, so they sold out and locked in their massive gains.  The companies were very lucrative for a short period of time, so that drove up their IPO price.  But VCs needed to get out before the popular games took a dive, which they inevitably did, and the investors got out at excellent valuations.

This is a great observation and I fully agree with the author.<p>I joined Box.com as an Engineer in 2008, when we were 5 engineers. Grew rapidly with the company and was most recently a Director in Engineering, managing multiple teams full of amazing people. Left after 6 years, to fulfill my entrepreneurial dreams. Box was my career-launching company. (And it is, for many other engineers). I have also worked at Microsoft and eBay.<p>Along the way, I had the incredible opportunity to help our technical teams grow from 5 to ~250 engineers. This meant living and breathing the interviewing machine exploring all its nooks and corners, and ups and downs.<p>Box is also a company that constantly questions and improves its interviewing processes. That relentless focus helped us hire great engineers.<p>I noticed however, that despite all that attention, hiring took an unreasonably long amount of time and much agony. We’d go through hundreds of resumes, countless phone screens and countless onsite interviews for each open position.<p>That bothered me to no end. If most of our interviews were of reasonably average difficulty, our scoring method was well-structured, and our interviewers well-trained, why would only a few candidates clear our interviews?  Yet, in the end, our pass rate was <5%. I was not ready to believe that rest 95% of people were not competent.<p>I dug into this extensively, and realized that while everyone was hard-working and very smart in their own way, they vastly under-estimated the amount of preparation it would take to clear programming interviews at top companies. They only had a vague idea of what to expect, and did not have enough practice to solve interview problems under time-pressure. Their daily jobs or schools did not prepare them for handling interviews.<p>I found more evidence of this from the career-coaching I did on the side (pro-bono). Many candidates would even want to change their careers, thinking they were not good at programming, simply because they weren&#x27;t able to crack interviews.<p>I&#x27;m now doing something similar in the valley, but in a very high-touch, classroom setting  way, for experienced professionals: <a href=""http://InterviewKickstart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://InterviewKickstart.com</a>.

9626394,comment,9623281,9623811,0,0,vlasev,,,"To your first point, wouldn&#x27;t a robot like that benefit from staggering the action of the legs? Instead of X impact at one point in time, have X/2 impact at two points in time? Would that create too much strain?<p>For my conclusion in point two, my insight comes from experience of copying animal movement. When I trained parkour my friends and I would copy animal movement from across the whole animal kingdom[1]. Here&#x27;s an example of quadrupedal movement[2]. A big problem for us bipeds in trying to run like quadrupeds is that our legs tend to be big, long and inflexible, while our arms tend to be much weaker than our legs. The effect of this combination is to make running properly like a an animal which evolved to run on all fours quite difficult. From my own experience, putting my legs more and more forward past my arms (i.e. copying the cheetah), made for a much easier time.<p>If you were to try to run like the robot, with symmetrical action, it would be extremely uncomfortable, because the impact is large at every step. Staggering the action allows for a much smoother run. Make any human run like that and they&#x27;ll eventually automatically switch to the less impactful staggered run.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymg1-Fhl69w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymg1-Fhl69w</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8oh5Xuy7NA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8oh5Xuy7NA</a>",1432924015

The real number 6, for example, always equals 2 x 3. Aside from reordering the factors (3 x 2), no other product will work. But to Cauchy and Lamé’s embarrassment, their German contemporary Ernst Kummer showed that certain complex numbers can be split into prime factors in more than one way.&quot;<p>Well, there&#x27;s also 6 = 1.5 x 4, etc. It&#x27;s just in the context of the whole numbers (i.e., integers) that 6 has specifically the prime factorization 2 x 3. And depending on what your notion of a whole complex number is, they have unique prime factorization as well. For example, the Gaussian integers (complex numbers of the form a + b * i, where a and b are ordinary integers) have unique prime factorization.<p>The Gaussian integers are the n = 4 case of &quot;Consider the complex numbers generated by adding, subtracting, and multiplying copies of a primitive n-th root of unity&quot;; Lamé&#x27;s mistake, pointed out and built upon by Kummer, was in assuming that the same property of unique factorization into irreducible elements would continue to hold even if n here was replaced by any prime (this assumption fails for the first time at n = 23).",1432923737

Some of the known issues are:<p>- choosing the number and spacing between deltas. Fine-grained deltas require more storage space, coarse-grained deltas require more download bandwidth.<p>- retiring old deltas: periodically deleting all deltas older than a certain version, replacing them with the full package of that version. Again a trade-off between storage space and download bandwidth.<p>For Git repositories, this would roughly translate to:<p>- choosing the number, history spacing, and size of the Git packs per repository.<p>- retiring old Git packs: periodically deleting Git packs older than a particular revision, replacing them with a bare repository at that revision.",1432923438

9626327,comment,9624476,9626069,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"re antivirus. It doesn&#x27;t work: they dodge it constantly. They can also use it to improve their odds of beating it by tuning the malware against it. Need I say more about why its barely a defense?<p>Back in 1961, Burroughs designed a mainframe [1] that anticipated all these problems. They tagged their memory with bits to protect pointers or differentiate code vs data. That&#x27;s two bits per word of data with almost no performance overhead if it&#x27;s all you use. That system was immune to almost every attack modern malware uses for code injection. It was very successful for a while but the market eventually chose against it in favor of IBM et al&#x27;s systems that did dumb, fast, data crunching with hardly any security. Market as a whole went that way.<p>So, the problem is code can be injected, the isolation mechanisms don&#x27;t work, and the toolsets are insecure by design. Fix these to make security the easy default with attackers working in a straight-jacket. The CHERI [2] team and others are doing exactly that. Investments in such systems will increase their functionality. I&#x27;ve seen architectures that even do it with 2 bits like Burroughs did albeit with a different model. It&#x27;s compatible with Windows architecture. What&#x27;s lacking isn&#x27;t technology or knowhow: it&#x27;s willingness of industry and FOSS to adopt methods that work instead of mainstream methods that don&#x27;t. Always been the problem. Putting backward compatibility and no rewrites ahead of everything else is the other huge contributor to insecurity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.smecc.org/The%20Architecture%20%20of%20the%20Burroughs%20B-5000.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smecc.org/The%20Architecture%20%20of%20the%20Burr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/</a>",1432923359

The difference is the memory management strategy: Usually, stack variables are all allocated at the beginning of a function, and all deallocated at the end. If all of the memory your program needs is tied to a particular scope like that, then it&#x27;s certainly faster than any other memory-management strategy. If you need to share data between scopes, build complicated data structures of indeterminate compile-time size, or allocate large blocks of memory (the stack is usually limited in size), then you have to do something different (like use the heap).<p>That said, I think the Rust approach to memory management is really interesting: try to tie all allocated memory to some scope, and keep track of when ownership is borrowed by or moved to a different scope.",1432922579

So to unilaterally deny one type of marriage versus another that is sanctioned by a state is illegal.<p>What&#x27;s really funny is that all these arguments were used buy the &quot;Bible Belt&quot; to KEEP slavery, owning people, on the books for just about as long as we have been discussing gay rights. The Feds could not end slaves as property without an amendment. Various states banned slavery, but the Feds ruled that slaves Owned in one state had to be respected as property rights during travel or if they escaped, even in states where slavery was illegal.<p>Of course many states treated interracial marriages the same way as gay marriage, well into the 1900&#x27;s..

5946427,comment,5946171,5946390,2,0,rickhanlonii,,,"Right, and the Prop 8 decision was procedural rather than ideological. They essentially ruled (for the first and only time) that a private party (here, the Prop 8 proponents) is not allowed to defend the constitutionality of a law--the State is required to make that argument.<p>Since the state declined to defend the law at lower courts, SCOTUS sent it back to that court with directions to dismiss it.<p>From Amy Howe at the SCOTUS Blog:<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s a Plain English take on Hollingsworth v. Perry, the challenge to the constitutionality of California&#x27;s Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage: After the two same-sex couples filed their challenge to Proposition 8 in federal court in California, the California government officials who would normally have defended the law in court, declined to do so. So the proponents of Proposition 8 stepped in to defend the law, and the California Supreme Court (in response to a request by the lower court) ruled that they could do so under state law. But today the Supreme Court held that the proponents do not have the legal right to defend the law in court. As a result, it held, the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the intermediate appellate court, has no legal force, and it sent the case back to that court with instructions for it to dismiss the case.&quot;<p>And since it was just posted, here is the same type of explanation for the DOMA ruling:<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s a Plain English take on United States v. Windsor, the DOMA case: The federal Defense of Marriage Act defines &quot;marriage,&quot; for purposes of over a thousand federal laws and programs, as a union between a man and a woman only. Today the Court ruled, by a vote of five to four, in an opinion by Justice Kennedy, that the law is unconstitutional. The Court explained that the states have long had the responsibility of regulating and defining marriage, and some states have opted to allow same-sex couples to marry to give them the protection and dignity associated with marriage. By denying recognition to same-sex couples who are legally married, federal law discriminates against them to express disapproval of state-sanctioned same-sex marriage. This decision means that same-sex couples who are legally married must now be treated the same under federal law as married opposite-sex couples.&quot;",1372258555

5946421,comment,5945865,5945865,2,0,hjay,,,"I think one of the most common misconceptions people have about freelancers, is that we know everything about every project we throw ourselves into. That couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth (at least for me).<p>As a freelancer, the most important skill is NOT coding. Yes, writing code gets you to the end-goal, but what the client really wants, is results and growth for their business. As a freelancer, you will often have to work on something that you don&#x27;t know 100%, and maybe even having barriers to accomplish the project. However, hiring a freelancer is very much looking at their past successes, and using that to gauge the result of their current project, along with the value this freelancer can bring. As long as you get it done and bring results, and maintain an amiable relationship with the client, not much else matters.<p>So in on that note, I would say which language you choose hardly matters. But that&#x27;s not true. You want to choose a language you are familiar with, and one that seems to be brought up in whichever areas you are looking for clients.<p>As many have already said, and I kind of hinted at above, learn as you build. This is the best and fastest way to gain the knowledge and skills you need. Much like building a startup, have something early on to put out into the world, and build on top of that.<p>Any projects can prove to someone you are worth hiring. As a freelancer, part of your job is to instill confidence into this potential client, and demonstrate to the the VALUE you add to their business. Not the algorithmic complexity, not the pretty code, not how many lines of code you&#x27;ve written, but the VALUE (increase in revenue, lower costs, higher conversions, putting their product on the forefront, etc) you bring to them.<p>I wrote a blog post[1] recently about things you should know about freelancing, it&#x27;s not too in depth as it&#x27;s targetted towards people who have not begun freelancing and are curious about it.<p>Keep improving yourself, and good luck!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jayhuang.org/blog/things-you-should-know-about-freelancing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jayhuang.org/blog/things-you-should-know-about-fr...</a>",1372258493

In this instance DOMA would require a &quot;legitimate purpose&quot; to target this group (like mid-level scrutiny), it is not that the SCOTUS could not find a legitimate purpose to over turn the law (as I believe you interpret), but that the law was overturned because the legislature did not have a legitimate purpose in creating the law (other than disparage and injure the targeted group, according to the majority opinion).<p>>Doesn&#x27;t this sort of judicial activism weaken the separation of powers<p>The idea of Judicial Activism is a red herring, when any court rules against ones own personal bias/interest.

This year i&#x27;m broke, but I went to a junior college for two years at $4000 a year, saved up, and I should graduate with a bachelors in C.S. with a minor in BioE for a total loan (for two years) I took out myself of ~$50,000.<p>1-2 years to pay back the loan, did it myself (I did have a cosigner for the loan, but it is still in my name AKA I call it doing it myself because i&#x27;m liable and am pretty responsible)<p>Quite frankly I would rather require each student to take out a loan themselves, than have my future self pay for the students to drink and screw around.

Do you think I will? Perhaps take some of the pressure off the public to pay, put it on the student and less people will default because only the most serious will go to expensive universities. Like I said, $4000 a semester at a junior college and I honestly think my education there was about the same quality as U of I, I had professors from Argonne national labs, one guy even designed the electronics for the f-18 hornet and taught as a kind of retirement.<p>Sorry for the rant, but the point is, I did it all myself and all of these comments about how hard or ridiculous it is it is are pathetic.

Accepting that as they begin to use it new use cases will emerge and you&#x27;ll have to make adjustments.  This doesn&#x27;t mean just don&#x27;t care what you select, it is just that in my experience this user base will have a hard time articulating their needs.  And even if you have a ton of experience they will still change requirements as they start using it.  So it is the start fast, adapt as needed methodology.  And I would just communicate it to the client that you are going to solve one need at a time, and expect that you will need to revisit them over 2-3 months as people begin using each solution.  The advantage to this, is some of that is really low hanging fruit that you could show him immediate benefits from, and have low risk to change.  Like moving all email/calendar to Google Apps, or pick your cloud solution there.<p>Also, I personally feel this approach is being realistic and respectful to the staff that it is hard to articulate all the needs until a user gets their hands dirty with the solution.  I also try not to use the word requirements with non-technical clients, instead opting for &quot;Needs&quot;, &quot;Wants&quot;, &quot;Dreams&quot; or something along those lines.<p>None of the project sounds hard technically, but it will take time and have some frustrations I imagine.<p>But I could easily see a Salesforce + Google (email, gdrive, calendar) + FreeConferenceCall (or something similar) + Skype.

Who do you trust?<p>To put (1) in context, the content on the Internet is largely provided free but is ad-supported. When it comes to display advertising, it&#x27;s sold almost entirely on a CPM basis (it may be resold on an eCPC or eCPA basis). It is at best only partially sold on an intent basis (meaning it&#x27;s enticing you to click on the ad or otherwise take some kind of action).<p>The relevance is that the most common &quot;defence&quot; of ad-blocking is &quot;I never click on ads anyway&quot;. While that <i>might</i> be true (let&#x27;s just say that the people who claim to have never clicked on an ad is a proper superset of the people who have never clicked on an ad) it&#x27;s also irrelevant since that may not be the intent and the publisher is getting paid to display the ad, not for you to click on it (unlike, say, search advertising, which is intent based).<p>So the ethical part here is you need to decide if you&#x27;re OK with denying publishers income yet still consuming their content. If you are against ads for whatever reason and don&#x27;t consume the content, that&#x27;s a position I can respect, otherwise it just strikes me as rationalized freeloading but YMMV.<p>As for (2), the big players like Google who dominate display advertising are regulated and deeply concerned (believe it or not) about privacy and the user experience. That&#x27;s why you can opt out of personalized ads [1], for example. I may be biased [2] but I trust Google far more than I trust some fly-by-night operation. Again, YMMV.<p>Recently there was a story about Ghostery reselling user data to advertisers [3]. How much can you <i>really</i> trust these basically unaccountable groups (in comparison)?<p>I should point out that there are two issues here that intertwine:<p>1. Ad-blocking;<p>2. Privacy.<p>My personal code of ethics is I don&#x27;t block ads because honestly I mentally block them out anyway. Going to the Westin site then seeing ads for the Westin everywhere doesn&#x27;t particularly bother me.<p>If a site has particularly egregioius ads (I include popups, most interstitials and any ads you need to dismiss in this category) then all bets are off. Block away. Banner ads however? Sure, why not?<p>But where I draw the line is with uselessly giving away your privacy in a way that doesn&#x27;t benefit publishers at all. I include all the various &quot;Like&quot; and &quot;Share&quot; buttons here. All of these track for no benefit to the publisher (other than the hope that you might use one).<p>Those I&#x27;ll happily block. Likewise if you&#x27;re Quora and you blur answers because I&#x27;m not logged in with Facebook, well you&#x27;ll get technically circumvented as well and I may just block any ads you have just because you&#x27;re being offensive.<p>Anyway, just consider that ad-blockers have access to a wide range of your data as well and ask yourself what they are doing or might do with that data. Is it really worth denying publishers income to not see an ad for shoes? Really?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.google.com/ads/preferences"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences</a><p>[2]: Disclaimer: I am a Google engineer working in display advertising<p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/06/ad-blocking-extension-ghostery-actually-sells-data-to-advertisers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/06/ad-blocking-extension-g...</a>",1372257327

As such, you might not be able to make your stated figure straight away - instead as an average when your earning potential rises with each completed job.<p>- Go around your local community first. A lot of people say that you shouldn&#x27;t work for friends/people you know, but when you&#x27;re starting out you need portfolio pieces and people are far more likely to take the risk on someone &#x27;green&#x27; if they get some face-face time now and then. Local restaurants and clubs was where I started.<p>- Contract up ... always >.<<p>- Specialise a bit. There seems to be a commonly held belief that freelancers should be full-stack engineers - largely because you are likely to be working solo on projects. Not only is this not realistic given your learning timescale, but I&#x27;ve also found it to be untrue. If a project needs work that you can&#x27;t do then you sub-contract to another freelancer. They will be happy for the work and there is always the possibility of payment in kind. One caveat is that you obviously take on the risk of the contractor messing up.",1372257127

My bad.<p>I agree, the weak links are almost always at bottom of the chain. Sometimes you can get a middle guy that&#x27;s working his way up but that&#x27;s luck. In the end, these things are done by getting someone to give someone else up in terms of turning or gathering info. So far from what I&#x27;ve read, I see no indication that the programs in discussion would actually have helped in the matters they cover. I&#x27;m sure it helps identify some of the lower links of the chain but all that does is point the way to people to use the traditional methods on.<p>The way I look at it is that the police could put a tap on every phone in the city but I seriously doubt that would help them arrest the local crime boss. It would point the way to find people to lean on to get the information you need to pursue him, but I doubt you&#x27;d get real evidence that way. You&#x27;d probably have to end up planting bugs to overhear conversations in private homes and businesses.

As you say, there&#x27;s a reason to keep things secret. The thing is, for programs like this there is supposed to be oversight and so far it appears that oversight has failed. To me, the biggest issue isn&#x27;t that the existence of such programs were confirmed, it was that they existed to the extent that they do without apparently any real oversight.

Generally the new construction or alternatively designed dorms are more expensive to rent.<p>> The dining options today are way better than what we had.

Typically corporate food chains try to get their place in the court and will wine and dine school administration for the chance to have a captive audience. The cafeteria style food options are still available and are cheaper (yes this food is really awful slop). Worse is that some universities require purchasing some amount of food ahead of time, whether it be a prepaid card usable anywhere or some kind of meal plan for the cafeteria style dining, milking money out of folks who prefer to live off campus and/or make their own food (esp. if they have special dietary requirements).<p>> The libraries are more functional, the sports facilities are all updated, etc.<p>This is generally true.

Knowing that geostationary orbits are stable enough in the earth-moon system for commercial purposes, I think low earth orbit weather satellites would remain stable in a &quot;small&quot; change like Earth-Mercury.  Someone with a lot more spare time on their hands will have to figure out at what point geostationary comsat orbits become unusably unstable.  I have a gut feeling, not having run the numbers, that a Earth-Jupiter system might not even have stable low earth orbits for weather satellites, much less high orbit geosync for comsats.<p>If for example, Mars, eliminated stable enough comsat orbits, you could put transponders on the surface of Mars for Earth use.  And vice versa, I guess.<p>I would imagine this would greatly complicate the design and operation of a usable space tether / elevator.  With obvious exceptions like absolutely perfect tidal locking would mean its pretty easy to string a lightly tensioned rope from one planet to the other.<p>At some point I imagine even &quot;launch loop&quot; technology would get messed up gravitationally.

Eventually you&#x27;ll get to a point where you can work in places where coding skills do matter, like dev studios, startups, big companies etc, but for non-tech small to medium businesses, they only care what you&#x27;ve done, not what the quality of your code is. You can make a damn good living setting up wordpress sites, installing a theme, adding content and managing it with social media accounts if you wanted, and that requires the least amount of skills out there.<p>Lets take the above scenario of being a wordpress installer. First, its about selling yourself in the right light, you&#x27;re not a wordpress installer that makes people websites. You&#x27;re an online presence consultant that helps SME&#x27;s engage with their audience and thus increase their profit.<p>Second, get your first client, ask everyone you know to put you in touch with small business owners, get meetings and show them the package you&#x27;re offering, do it for $500 or something, hell do it for free if you have to, just get something you can use as a case study, anything, a local pet shop, whatever. Once you&#x27;ve got your case study, get your own presence setup, put your case study on your website, get business cards printed up etc. Prepare a powerpoint presentation and a few handouts with the benefits of an online presence, making sure your contact info is on this.<p>Now join your local non-tech business groups, chamber of commerce, networking events etc, and get yourself speaking engagements, make presentations to local SME&#x27;s explaining that they can increase their profit and talk to their customers using an online presence, tell them about social media accounts and how successful companies use them, show them they can build a mailing list, show them stats on how well conversions work using the mailing list, and at the end, show them how you did all of this for your local pet shop.<p>You are now the expert in all these guy&#x27;s minds on how to do this, they will call on you if they need it done, they will recommend their friends to you cuz you knew what you were talkin about. Get their email addresses and add them to a mailchimp account and send out a weekly newsletter re-iterating techniques on how to communicate with SME&#x27;s customers online.<p>Work will flow in. Now, i&#x27;ve used a very low skilled example for you, i dont know if thats what you want to do, but this can be applied to just about anything you want to go for, generic stuff like iOS/Android apps or specific stuff like ordering and invoicing systems for oil and gas companies.<p>Do things, tell people.",1372255697

The market demand for a college educated workforce has exacerbated this price pressure to cause the 5-10% year/year increases.<p>For example, the University of Washington has sustained a state funding decrease of nearly 50% since 2009. In 1990 the funding per student was $17,000 with 82% paid by the state and the remainder by the student, in 2013 the state pays 29% and the student 71%.<p>The demand for a college educated workforce has also increased since 1990, with the majority of middle class occupations requiring a four year degree. This demand is inelastic, and while it is true that federal student loans make up nearly 90% loans, if supplanted by private loan bodies at higher interest rates it is unlikely that the market demand would decrease.",1372255373

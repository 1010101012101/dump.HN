In general while hacking, anything ambient, repetitive (electronica) or without vocals (jazz/classical), or vocals in a language I mostly don't understand (tropicalia, death metal, stereolab) is a great soundtrack.<p>While <i>designing</i> though, no sounds at all!  Maybe something <i>really</i> ambient to shut out environmental noise, like Stars of the Lid.",1191288830

Doesn't really matter what it is: Schubert sonatas, 70s Herbie Hancock, showtunes ...something that requires the same number of brain cells to take advantage of as a library that I wrote a long time ago and have been using ever since.",1191288625

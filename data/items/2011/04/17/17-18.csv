2456562,comment,2453895,2456106,2,0,pkteison,,,"Currently, patents have worth well in excess of the application cost.  Much of this is because patents are generally presumed valid - it's bloody hard to get a court to overturn one, for example.  The article points out that this presumption is ill founded - patent examiners don't have time to do a thorough review - and suggests that the solution is to make it much easier to challenge them in court.<p>You want to talk about a situation where only those with money can make money?  Make it easy to overturn a patent by hiring more lawyers.  Cost of keeping a patent will skyrocket, value of obtaining a patent will plummet.<p>If you're going to have software patents, it seems much better for everyone to have strong patents by weeding out lousy patents before they are granted than by inviting constant multi million dollar legal battles.",1303063084

2456559,comment,2456080,2456432,2,0,gnosis,,,"<i>""The author ignores that Rand would have quite limited access to information on the whole story, for a start.""</i><p>She may not have had the <i>whole</i> story, but how much of the story did she need?<p>Hickman's entire claim to fame was the cold blooded murder of a little girl.  What nuances could Rand have been missing that could have mislead her on that point?<p>Here's what the author of the original article had to say about Rand's knowledge of the case:<p><pre><code>   The gory details of Hickman's crime were indeed reported in the newspapers\n   of the day. (They didn't call 'em the Roaring Twenties for nothin'.) Nearly\n   all the info I presented was taken from contemporaneous newspaper accounts.\n   Rand followed the case closely enough to know the day-by-day events of the\n   trial, so she surely knew what Hickman had done. She just didn't care. She\n   mentions not one word about Hickman's 12-year-old victim in all the hundreds\n   of words she penned about the case.\n\n   If you've read Rand's journals, you know that she did present her ethical\n   positions in detail, even when writing for herself.\n\n   Objectivists typically bend themselves into pretzel-like shapes to avoid\n   acknowledging Rand's obvious psychological problems. The facts are, Rand\n   knew exactly what Hickman had done and admired him anyway. Make of this what\n   you will.\n</code></pre>\n(The above quote is from one of the comments to this article:<p><a href=""http://michaelprescott.typepad.com/michael_prescotts_blog/2005/06/ad_hominem_ad_n.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelprescott.typepad.com/michael_prescotts_blog/20...</a> )<p><i>""Rand was fascinated by what she glimpsed in the news story (namely the 'I am like the state; what's good for me is right' quote, and the mob-mentality of the public reaction), because it gave her some ideas for a work of fiction, regardless of the facts of this particular case.""</i><p>Even if that was all that fascinated her about Hickman (doubtful), it's quite interesting what conclusions she drew from his words:  not that that kind of attitude could lead egomaniacs like Hickman to senseless murder but rather that they are ideals to be emulated and praised.<p><i>""But this is where Michael Prescott has 'done the dirty' - the sentence I italicized was, if you read the whole passage from the diary, not referring specifically to this murder case""</i><p>Are you kidding me?  The section she wrote it in is titled ""The Hickman Case"", and it's clear she is talking about that case in particular from beginning to end.  The entire section reinforces what she said in that quote.  She said it and meant it about the Hickman case.

The implementation of ""stretch"" gets inherited into class Cicrle, so stretching a Circle yields a new Ellipse as the method signature says.<p>That example may look impractical. Here's a better one: define SanitizedString as a subclass of String (if your language allows that). Methods that output HTML to the client can take SanitizedStrings as input, so the type checker ensures the absence of XSS attacks. The constructor of SanitizedString could take an ordinary String and sanitize it, and that's the whole implementation of SanitizedString, because all other methods are already provided by String and none of them can break the sanitization because String is immutable. So using immutable objects allows you to write less code and get more compile-time guarantees.",1303061922

OO: Learn it, love it, add it to your toolset, but don't assume all problems are the nails to its hammer.<p>First thought: don't provide scaling methods - that's an operation best left to non-method functions or procedures. We scale lots of shapes in lots of ways that can make their original names less applicable.<p>After that, I started considering the models and their respective inheritance. If we expect the programming organizational structure to match the geometric organizational structure (e.g. circles are ellipses with the same axial lengths), then we might be thinking about the problem the wrong way. Do we model the hierarchy on the Real World or in a way that makes more sense in our library? I suppose it depends entirely on our purposes.<p>Sure, a circle's requirements for state are less than an ellipse, but it won't hurt to just draw a circle based on that additional state.

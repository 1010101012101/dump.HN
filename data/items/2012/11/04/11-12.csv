I was not implying that they were stupid or that anyone else would have seen it better; just stating the fact that they did not anticipate what ceding control of the OS market to Microsoft would mean.<p>From what I've read, IBM didn't pay much attention to this decision - they considered MS-DOS 1.0 a ""stop-gap"" measure to make the PC-g useful (original IBM-PC model, later followed by XT, jr and AT) while they were getting a real operating system (CP/M 86) ready.<p>In fact, IBM's original PC-g seems like it was almost an afterthought (""oh, Apple implies there actually is a market for a personal business computer? let's put a leg in this market, just in case""). The original design had very little IBM in it - it was very close to Intel reference designs for the 8088, using available off-the-shelf components (the main non-intel parts were a Motorolla CRT controller, a NEC floppy disk controller which was backward compatible with an older Intel floppy disk controller; unlike Apple's Woz-designed Video adapters and disk controllers).",1352029999

Currently, they are on the short end of a massive power imbalance that puts them at a competitive disadvantage against iPhone. (Just read John Gruber's gleeful posts deriding the (admittedly astonishing) lack of high-speed data on the Nexus 4.)<p>In fact, Google has been gunning for this disruption since the very first Nexus One. Remember, they introduced that phone -- their first -- unlocked and unsubsidized, with direct-to-consumer sales. At the time, that was a novel approach (and really exciting for knowledgeable consumers). However, they got their ass beat down by the carriers and had to whimper back home with their tail between their legs. They even stopped selling phones direct for a time.<p>So they failed at subverting the carrier's (anticompetitive, illogical, anti-consumer) business model the first time they tried, but you can bet they still want to. Apple actually does, too, for similar reason, but Apple didn't underestimate the power of the carriers, and waited until they had the most dominant phone in human history and the leverage that came along with to make the carriers lay down and take it however Apple deigns to give it to them.<p>Google would love to be in a similar position, but they won't be until either Google can make a phone close to the iPhone in popularity, or the carrier-subsidy model goes away or is at least greatly diminished (neither thing being very likely in the foreseeable future).",1352029701

4739518,comment,4739395,4739395,9,0,archgrove,,,"I think any answer to this will have to hinge on why, given the sales disparity, app revenue and ""usage"" metrics (i.e. mobile browsing) is still either in favour of iOS or tied. My personal reasoning is that carriers are pushing low end Android phones as the standard handset you get when you walk in the door and say ""I need a phone"". These people don't really know what they're getting in terms of an ecosystem, and seem to use very little smart functionality.<p>iPhone users (and ""high end"" Android users), on the other hand, probably know exactly what they're buying into. These are the users that will determine developer targeting. Two ways I see for Android to decisively win this: either these ""low-end"" users start to participate in the eco-system, or the rise of low income countries (much of Asia, Africa etc) makes the weight of numbers so far in Android's favour that even with a much lower engagement rate, the money's there. Apple could counter this with ""iPhone Nano"", I guess, but it would require them to sacrifice a lot of margin.<p>Outside tip: Samsung are becoming the Apple of Android smartphones, selling the preponderance of the high end handsets. Within 18 months, I suspect we'll see them fork Android to differentiate themselves from the ""sell at near cost, make it up on ecosystem"" strategy that Google's pursuing  now with the Nexus (that reduce Samsung to basically a hardware supplier on razor-thin margins). Either that, or they'll use carrier relationships to ensure these cheap, high-end handsets don't ever really get in front of non-geeky consumers.",1352029209

Then they made the iPod cheap.  Nobody could compete.  Could companies like Diamond or iRiver have made better devices if they didn't have to compete with cheap iPod's?  Almost certainly.  Once Apple diversified the iPod line into the extremophile niches other mp3 player manufacturers were clinging to it was game over.  Complete and utter dominance.  Now almost nobody buys iPod's because everybody's phone can do the same job.<p>Apple knew that the key to maintaining dominance was to drive down prices faster than the competition without compromising quality.  By offering premium devices at prices that are just barely above that of inferior devices Apple made the iPod a no-brainer purchase for consumers.  They did this so well that it was only Apple themselves who finally obsoleted the iPod with the iPhone.  They've tried to do the same thing with the tablet and have arguably built up some degree of incumbency with the iPad.  Low-margin pricing on the Nexus 7 and Kindle's can be seen as attempts by Google and Amazon to fight Apple's tablet incumbency before they're locked out of the market completely.<p>Let's face it, if Amazon or Google tried to sell their tablets at the same price as Apple's offerings they'd never catch up.  Even if they were of exactly equal quality, Apple's is the proven product because it's been around longer.  If Google and Amazon made poorer quality tablets and sold them cheap, but with decent profit margins, they'd wind up like Diamond and iRiver.  Only their ability to sell at low-margin and profit from ads/media sales gives Google and Amazon the edge they need to compete with Apple and have any hope of catching up.<p>The end result of this is a three-way battle for tablet superiority where there would have only been one choice: the iPad.  Oh, and now Microsoft is throwing their hat into the ring too...  Quite frankly, I think the next few years are going to be very kind to tablet-fans, and that's partly in thanks to ""predatory"" pricing.",1352027823

  2011, but RIM is convinced it has a slumbering tiger on 
  its hands. ""It changes the game because we're making 
  mobile fit the Web, not the other way around,"" says 
  Balsillie.

  What does that mean? RIM has figured out a way to squeeze
  a full computing platform into a tablet, which is a bit 
  like fitting the Incredible Hulk into an Armani suit. The
  PlayBook will deliver the entire Web at the same speed as 
  a home computer can, without the need for special apps 
  that repackage and abbreviate mobile content.
</code></pre>
Read: it can run Flash. Unfortunately I'm not entirely sure that is a compelling enough selling point for most consumers. Native apps have grown in popularity because they provide a consistent, polished user experience specifically tailored to the device. One that is generally unmatched by most websites (unless they were specifically designed with the mobile/tablet form factor in mind).",1294613994

At the time, there're many places that look appealing, and little reason to choose one over the other.  And then it's only with hindsight that one of those becomes a big success and the rest become has-beens.<p>I was thinking about this today when responding to a Reddit post whining about how there're no good high-paying jobs left in this country:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/eyu1o/the_unemployment_rate_is_it_right_or_wrong/c1c170c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/eyu1o/the_unemploym...</a><p>Of course that's false.  However, when I think about how I got my good high-paying job, the answer that comes to mind is ""pure dumb luck"".  I happened to like computers when I was a teen in the 90s, and I happened to stick with it through the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, and so now that these CS jobs are paying six figures easily, I've got close to ten years experience in skills that are very hot.  But I wasn't really thinking about professions or salary at the time; I was thinking ""Hey, this seems sorta interesting, I wonder what else I can find out...""",1294613877

In order to enforce contracts we must have identities. Since the Government (specifically the judiciary) enforces contracts, this means that we must be entering into these contracts under Government-managed identities.<p>Currently we acquire and prove this Government-managed identity using an ad-hoc, decentralised, system with much duplication. I can use a passport or my driver's license or my birth certificate or perhaps some utility bills or some combination. This causes various problems, including fraud and waste.<p>If two parties mutually choose to enter into a contract over the Internet, and this contract is to be enforced by the judiciary, then it would be ideal for them to be able to verify each others' legal entities and authorisation. I think that properly implemented this could eliminate a large amount of online fraud.<p>Nothing about the principle of such a system inherently creates privacy problems, since when parties enter into a contract they already expect to reveal their identities to each other, and nothing would necessarily be forcing people to reveal their identities in any other situation, just the same as is the case at the moment.T here is a risk of a slippery slope of course; I can't deny that.<p>There's no reason such a system has to be centralised, though. X.509 certificates would work fine, for example, issued at the same time as a birth certificate, with each local office as a CA.<p>Unfortunately, the problem is with implementation. I don't think that any government is competent enough to put a system together that does meet privacy requirements, and there are too many self-interested parties who would influence and corrupt the design of such a system.",1294611651

My mother used to joke about the fact that our 18th birthday would consist of a moving trucks as a present. While it was a tongue in cheek joke there was without a doubt a grain of truth to her attitude. Fortunately for me, my grandparents took me in long before that. They came from a different culture than my mother. I am from the US south and the old southerners have a distinctly different culture than that of the rest of the us. There was a lot more French and Spanish influence in the south and up until my grandparents generation that culture was the norm. Anyways, not to side track too much into the distinct cultures of the US or the loss of those cultures, but my point is my grandparents came from a culture in which it was normal for a child to live and help around the home until the time that they where on stable footing to go out into the world. Usually there was a gift of land or some other property that would help the child start to make their way in the world. All of my grandfathers siblings got a portion of the homestead when they became of age from my Great-Grandfather. That was pretty much the norm in the American south up until around the 1940's. While I did not receive a gift of land, I did receive the gift of time. My grandparents allowed me to live with them and supported me while I pursued ventures to that would help me make it in the world. On the final venture they purchased a computer for me and the rest was history. Had I been forced out at 18 who knows where I would have ended up I certainly know that I would not enjoy the quality of life I do know. For that I am eternally grateful to them. I plan to do the same for my children, I always talk to them about ways to make money and be your own boss. Better yet I serve as an example to them. I plan to make sure that before any one of my kids leaves home that they have a functional and profitable venture to call their own. That is the greatest gift you can ever give to your children, the gift of time to discover one's self.<p>The thing to remember is that not only is their a cultural element to this but there is also an economic element to this. I have read several studies that state while the American quality of life measured on the indicators of food availability and health care has significantly improved, the real wealth of the average US citizen has declined. So some of this cultural element seems to be born out of necessity.",1294611552

From the article:<p>So if they wanted to be a contender again, this is how they could do it:<p>(1) Buy all the good ""Web 2.0"" startups. They could get substantially all of them for less than they'd have to pay for Facebook.<p>(2) Put them all in a building in Silicon Valley, surrounded by lead shielding to protect them from any contact with Redmond.<p>I feel safe suggesting this, because they'd never do it. Microsoft's biggest weakness is that they still don't realize how much they suck. They still think they can write software in house. Maybe they can, by the standards of the desktop world. But that world ended a few years ago.<p>====<p>This is brilliant.  And when we look at the Microsoft Kin Phone Debacle of 2010, we see that indeed they splashed the cash to buy a startup (Danger) to get into the smartphone game, but they critically failed the second part of the plan, which is the lead shielding bit.<p>This is why PG is a genius, and this is why we can say that Microsoft is dead.  Because they are the problem.  The problem with Microsoft <i>is</i> Microsoft.  Because they are irrelevant, and to Microsoft being irrelevant is worse than death.<p>One of the things I've noticed about Microsoft over the last couple of years, is that when someone leaves Microsoft, and they blog about it (as you do), and then you get ex-Microsofties arguing with current-Microsofties, is that they have their own weird sub-culture and language that is incomprehensible to anyone on the outside.  The more inward focused they become, the less and less relevant to everyone on the outside they will be.  This is another sign of their decline.<p>Joel Spolsky said some interesting things about this, on the topic of hiring programmers.  Someone asked him how much a programmer should be paid, and he said that across the industry there was a pretty uniform amount of profit that a company can make per programmer - something like $100k-200k, but that there are a couple of exceptions to this rule, one is Microsoft, because the Windows and Office parts of their business are ridiculously profitable, and the other is Google.  And that Microsoft makes millions per programmer, so they can afford to go out and hire the good and the bad, in order simply to prevent them from working for their competitors.  So they hire all these people, and then ignore them or put them to work on bike sheds.  I think it is very dangerous for a company of any size to ignore their smart people, and this is another sign of their decline.",1294611520

WPF uses a mark-up language to build UI elements and is thus more designer-friendly than WinForms and older Windows UI technologies - this fact in combination with the Aero UI leads to more elegant-looking Windows apps imho.<p>Apple has a longer-history of offering designer-friendly tools and UI guidelines to go with it, so that's probably where the perception comes from, but I'd argue it's a dated premise now.",1294611476

Jeff Dean says that the hallmark of a good systems programmer is the ability to mentally simulate the effects of a number of different designs so that you can quickly throw out ones that won't work.  You don't sit in a corner trying to perfect your design, you go out and talk to many potential users of your system to make sure you understand its requirements, then you come up with many <i>possible</i> designs that might fulfill those requirements, then you prune that down to one design that you actually implement.",1294611251

Abrash notes it himself - his VGA/DOS knowledge became meaningless within the span of 2 years.<p>One thing that is overlooked in all the emphasis on 3D rendering is that real-time strategy also developed in the same era as the first-person shooter. This isn't just because of mice, but because it was now feasible to do fast real-time pathfinding in games. Earlier, similar attempts at the genre suffer from playing sluggishly or avoiding any pathfinding.<p>Another 90's genre that came about because of hardware improvements is music games: CDs and memory for sample playback made it possible to play back high-quality audio tracks.",1294610995

The ID system would allow the creation and enforcement of such system.<p>The support for this comes in part because of pressure from the groups who are concerned about privacy and fretting over how their browsing data is used. While infringement of privacy hampers the growth of ecommerce, complete ban on harboring data hurts e-businesses (they won't be able to advertise efficiently). The solution to it is to create a free market: assign everyone a unique id, to which your preferences about harboring date will be assigned. Even better, data associated with that id can be considered proprietary, and users can license it to companies who are willing to pay for it and users can sue companies that infringe on this proprietary data bc courts will recognize it as solely yours. This is a good start if government wants to step in to protect your privacy from the ""evil"" corporations, while not hindering the growth of e-businesses.<p>Ideally, you will be protected from corporations who are after your private data.

We need to ACTUALLY have capitalism.<p>The above article seems to claim that we can fix capitalism by adding socialism to capitalism.<p>socialism != capitalism<p>They are mutually exclusive for the most part.<p>First it is important to note that we do not live in a pure capitalist system.  I would estimate it as 25% capitalism, 25% socialism, and 50% kleptocracy (special interests / corruption).<p>To blame capitalism for all the problems is akin to taking an Olympic gold metalist, tying him up in iron chains, throwing him in a pool and then blaming swimming as the cause of drowning.<p>Capitalism is by far the most efficient system for increasing the wealth of an ENTIRE society.  History has shown that societies prosper in direct proportion to how much they embrace capitalism.<p>We are currently moving from capitalism towards socialism and kleptocracy (think klepto as in stealing).<p>The common complaints against capitalism are not actually complaints against capitalism; they are usually against corporatism (regulation that favors corporations) or kleptocracy.  Why do corporations have tax breaks employees can't take even though their situations are similar?<p>Bank bailouts were not a failure of capitalism.  Capitalism would say that no company can get money for free.  All money must be traded from other individuals wishing to purchase from you.  The fact that the banks knew they were most likely to be bailed out created a moral hazard that encouraged them to take risks.  ""Privitized gains, socialized losses"".  Under pure capitalism a bank would not take such foolish action because they would know they would have a high probability of going out of business.<p>Monopolies are often created by government policy, not by free markets.  For instance, why do lots of communities only have 1 ISP even though there are competitors that would love to do business there?  It is because the city grants a license to that one company for a long period of time.  DNS registration was granted a monopoly by the government.  Why can't we have other DNS authorities?  Surely the vast majority of people on here can still make a profit and charge cheaper for domain names.  Why does GoDaddy have to pay a fee to another company that doesn't actually provide any real value?<p>In capitalism, if I was able to invest at 30% each year I could open my own bank and give out 10% in interest to all my depositors.  Instead we are stuck with abusive banks.<p>The only semi-rational (emphasis on semi) argument that I have heard against capitalism is that those with capital have a higher chance of getting more capital and that this would lead to a concentration of power.  It may in fact do this, but the moment the power is abused, others with capital will combine their resources to take the place of the exploitative company, or there will be revolts and people will boycott that company.<p>The system is set up so that businesses are fettered with regulations such as minimum wage and hiring ethnically diverse people (as opposed to the most qualified).  Under global capitalism, the companies in countries that do not have those laws will drive the US companies out of business.  Businesses that can will be forced to move to those countries if they wish to survive.  It is no shock to me that unemployment is on the rise.",1294610557

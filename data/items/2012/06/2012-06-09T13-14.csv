4088102,comment,4087631,4088063,2,0,Retric,,,"There are programs that given enough time will come up with piece values for arbitrary board games like chess.  Non random board games are actually one of the easier things to translate into computer code, the problem is games like go are inherently difficult.  I suspect with perfect play the first go player completely dominates the board just like with smaller boards that have been solved, but the ultra aggressive gameplay required to pull this off is impossible to pull off with any sort of reasonable hardware.  So, it's really a question of discovering heuristics that allow computationally reasonable pay to still create an acceptable level of imperfect play, and piece values are just one of those heuristics.  Perfect play in chess can ignore positional concepts and just look for paths that either force a checkmate or a tie.<p>The problem with language translation is you need to understand the context of an idea before you can accurately translate it which is why humans have such issues translating technical content they don't understand.<p>That said, humans can decode things that are close to linguistic gibberish so even a poor translation is often good enough.  Google translate is already rather useful though a great set of heuristics despite an endless array of edge cases it fumbles though.  It's a useful path that get's ever more expensive the more demanding the problem.",1339250123

This is not as simple as just developing empathy for the other sex, because according to current customs and expectations:  men are expected to be taking care of women, women should be trading up etc.<p>Whenever the question of equality of sexes come in tech, the arguments are always split into two factions. One side argues that there is no such thing as discrimination of sex in tech. It is a meritocracy and that is the only way it can be, and women are not in tech because they do not want to be / are naturally less talented in programming. The other side argues this is not the case and that you feel so only because you have no daughter/are a virgin/you are a basement dwelling looser.This line of thinking is not productive.

We had our fun, but it significantly damaged our culture and firmly planted our female participation at 15-20%, with a female OSS contribution rate of 1.5-5%.

Our frequent raunchy behavior typically focuses on heteronormative jokes, staying completely ignorant and offensive to the LGBTQ folks out there.<p>So here's the deal, Microsoft: you have some work to do. First, you do something about this, like fire the decision-makers involved (publicly or privately, your choice). Next, issue a real apology that goes well beyond ""we're looking into this."" Then, grab a crapton of moneysay $3 million... $1 million for each minute of the songand donate it to programmer-centric inclusive groups. Speaking as primarily a Rails dev, my brainstorming is biased, but here's a good list to get started: Rails Bridge, Girl Develop It, DevChix, etc. Make certain that there's no way to tie this large donation to furthering Microsoft-specific causes; you need to heal dev community at large that you just brutally damaged.<p>I understand this ""skit"" probably didn't come from Redmond, but that's the price you pay for growing to the size of Microsoft.

Just as an example, I wrote a helper script in Greasemonkey at one point for large versions of <a href=""http://www.puzzle-loop.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.puzzle-loop.com/</a> , the rules of which are ""You have to draw lines between the dots to form a single loop without crossings or branches. The numbers indicate how many lines surround it."" It's very satisfying to click once and then see an algorithm performing all of the drudge-work, leaving you to focus on the really interesting bits which you haven't yet been able to articulate as rules. One interesting problem in the above link is knowing when you're about to create a region which only has an odd number of ends inside of it. I found a very pretty way to do this in most cases.<p>The central problem of the translation computer is that often, knowing which translation of word W is important depends on understanding the context around W, sometimes out a couple of sentences. The central problem of understanding the context of W, however, would demand a much more holistic approach than the above translation program seems to provide.<p>The problem in both is precisely a declarative/imperative divide. We are very good at working out, given the adequacy conditions for the solution (the ""rules of the game""), what sorts of automatic reflex actions we can do (the ""moves"" of the game, I suppose). We know the rules, we figure out the moves. Ideally, we would like to just tell a computer the rules of chess without specifying that there is something called 'value' of a piece, and that the computer should find values for e.g. the loss of a knight in comparison to the loss of a bishop. It should be able to work out the principles of effective play, if we want true machine learning.<p>It is my contention, to tie this all together, that without something which appears like machine learning, we won't have anything which appears like machine understanding, and that a machine translation would appear like a machine understanding, due to context-sensitivity in translation: you will hand it ""Knives were good for helping humans to hunt"" and it will accidentally translate ""good"" as the equivalent for ""ethical"" rather than the more-likely-intended ""efficient"", because it correlates ""helping"" and ""humans"" with ethics.",1339248963

But nowhere does Hayek disprove the existence of aggregate demand (whether business cycles are caused by monetary policy or fiscal policy or some other factor is debatable - their end effect is always on aggregate demand).<p>But statistical observations of the aggregate often lead to great discoveries and the foundation of a subject. Max Planck's enormous set of highly aggregate <i>experimental</i> data (without him knowing the mechanism by which light operates) led him to formulate the ""quantum"" hypothesis (ie light is quantized as photons) - which was the founding stone for quantum mechanics and all the great stuff that followed.<p>We have such numbers in engineering - the Reynold's number, the Nusselt number etc. We don't know how they arise from chaotic microscopic behaviour but we do know these quantities exist. They have a profound effect on the onset of turbulence in fluid flow, onset of convection in heat-transfer and a whole lot more. The effects themselves can be measured and be tallied with a ""Reynold's number"" of say 3000 (which is again based on conduit dimensions, pressure gradient, viscosity - all measurable quantities but we don't how they tie up together to give rise to turbulence). Never stopped us from making pumps and engines and life better for the world.<p>As an aside, Hayek's theory and the whole Austrian school of thought is the <i>least</i> empirical of all such branches.

I think his [Pure Theory of Capital] is unreadable. On the other hand, The Road to Serfdom is one of the great books of our time."" (copied verbatim from Wikipedia).<p>There is a difference between normative economics (which the political leaders and Paul Krugman propound - ie the ""That's how it should be"" class) and positive economics (which, as a subject, deals with discovering mechanisms of the economy and searching for empirically verifiable variables that can validate those mechanisms).

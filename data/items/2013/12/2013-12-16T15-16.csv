Can you really have a &quot;voluntary&quot; exchange of indebtedness?<p>No, no, no. We do not agree intuitively on what property is. What about a factory that you built with your own hands that becomes a utility for a community? At some point, your private property and private creations become integral to a community, and that&#x27;s where things become muddy.<p>I want to add, lastly, that if we have a true competition of non-debt currency, we may have part of a solution. I have some thoughts written on my blog post, but it&#x27;s not well thought out and perhaps somebody can build upon it.<p><a href=\"http://jaekwon.wordpress.com/2013/12/02/the-supernova-theory-of-deflationary-currency/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jaekwon.wordpress.com/2013/12/02/the-supernova-theory...</a>",1387209555

It&#x27;s easy to understand the concerns regarding spying, and most people have a visceral negative reaction.  It&#x27;s much more difficult to elicit that type of response to, say, human rights violations that don&#x27;t directly affect most Americans.<p>In this case, I think that the media is siding with the people (more viewers / ad revenue).  If this were any other type of leak, without the same populism, the media most likely wouldn&#x27;t be as &quot;friendly&quot;.  There is dirt, but it hasn&#x27;t been brought to light because it wouldn&#x27;t sell well (who wants to bash the guy who told us that the NSA is spying on us?)",1387209386

I am now part-owner of an established company, and occasionally we recruit.  The following is my experience based on some successful hires, some unsuccessful hires, and many, many CVs and interviews.<p>When I look as a CV I want to know what value you&#x27;ll bring to my company.  I want to know why you&#x27;ll be worth the money I&#x27;ll pay you, and how well you&#x27;ll fit.  Yes, there was a job description, but your role will change, develop, and in the end you may be doing something completely different from what we originally thought we needed.<p>So I want to see, quickly, what value you claim you&#x27;ll bring to my company.  That means you&#x27;ll need to have thought about that, and tailored the CV to match not just the job description, but the homework you&#x27;ve done on what we do.  In particular, that makes it hard to get a job via a recruitment firm.<p>After that, I want to see the evidence that your claims are true.  Do you claim to write clear, usable, effective code?  Show me some code.  Do you claim to work well with others?  Tell me of specific occasions that I can verify.<p>Sometimes you can&#x27;t provide evidence, and I understand that.  Make it clear that you understand that I will somehow need to verify your claims.  Be sympathetic - put yourself in my place, and help me see you as a potentially valuable asset.<p>And all this is true even if you don&#x27;t have a degree.  State that you know things, and then provide evidence.  I&#x27;ve employed people with and without degrees, and it&#x27;s been interesting to see how different people have worked out.<p>tl;dr - No, you don&#x27;t need a degree.

Is that correct? If so, don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s a contradictory idea?<p>That is a good question that people often have. I think the government should use retaliatory force, never initiatory force. Preventing alternate defense agencies (the anarcho-capitalist idea) and levying taxes for the proper functions of government (police, courts, and military) actually are retaliatory exercises of force, not initiated force.<p>The threat of initiated force is tantamount to initiated force. So, retaliatory force to stop a threat is legitimate. Moreover, consider the case of a just war against a country that threatens the US; there may be civilian casualties among non-participants in the country of the enemy. The proximate cause of such casualties would be the US military, but the fundamental cause is the enemy government; they died to retaliatory force. A similar case is occuring when an ideal government uses force to collect minimal taxes to establish police, courts, and military. The fundamental cause is the natural threat of those that would violate rights. It would be ideal if all funding for government could be levied voluntarily, via donations, but if not, my argument here provides a solution.<p>This is not an Objectivist view, because it was not part of anything Ayn Rand wrote.

Currencies are generally a mere representation of production, not the output of production itself. Let me explain:<p>If a worker on an assembly line in South Carolina makes a window motor for a car, he is paid in USD. But the USD he is paid is not the output of his labor; the output of his labor is a window motor that is eventually put into a car, that some software engineer may drive on his way to work creating other productive (albeit non-physical) things. It&#x27;s the economic web.<p>Bitcoin is an economic dead-end. It takes CPU cycles to make a Bitcoin, and those cycles aren&#x27;t used for anything else. It is an output of production that has no intrinsic value. Well, that&#x27;s not ENTIRELY true: Bitcoin has had some fleeting value as a loophole that allows the economy to reclaim some dead weight loss from government regulation, but as those loopholes close, the economic value of Bitcoin diminishes.<p>Bitcoin is different from other stores of value that behave like currencies (such as gold) because it has no use other than as a store of value. Gold has industrial uses due to its physical and chemical properties, and it is desired in the consumer space as a material to make jewelry out of. But Bitcoin is not an input to production: its sole purpose and use is as a store of value. The price of Bitcoin will never stabilize for this reason: even if people decide to stop using gold as a store of value, it will continue to have a price floor based on its industrial and consumer use.<p>Thus my position that Bitcoin is not truly a currency, and the way it&#x27;s being traded today is much more akin to something like a junk bond. It is an asset because it is limited by the factors of production: it is the exclusive output of production. Currency is different than an asset <i>specifically because</i> there is a central authority that can issue new currency without increasing production.

Indeed, that&#x27;s their primary audience. The short-term advantages of breastfeeding are extremely relevant to mothers in countries where the water may not be clean and where babies are constantly exposed to high levels of pathogens. Those considerations are far less relevant to babies born in the first world.<p>It&#x27;s stupid to take WHO recommendations, or medical recommendations generally, at face value, because they generally are devoid of any cost-benefit analysis. Take this study of short-term benefits done in the U.K. <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/119/4/e837.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/119/4/e837.ful...</a>. It found a 53% reduction in diarrhea hospitalizations from exclusive breastfeeding, and a 27% reduction in lower respiratory tract infections. This is a very strong result and justifies the &quot;breast is best&quot; recommendation. Yet, when subjected to cost-benefit analysis, the result isn&#x27;t so clear. The incidence of these conditions in the sample of infants was only 1-3% to begin with. In other words, exclusive breastfeeding reduces the chance of a diarrhea hospitalization from 1.1% to 0.5%, and for a lower respiratory tract infection from 3.2% to 2.3%. And remember, both conditions are easily treatable.<p>On the other side of the scale, exclusive breastfeeding guarantees that the mother will be saddled with the primary role of feeding the infant for six months to a year and cannot easily delegate the task to the father (even with pumping, the father remains wholly dependent on the mother). Does a statistically significant, but small, reduction in an unlikely outcomes really justify blanket recommendations to exclusively breastfeed? Do you apply that same sort of extreme caution to every parenting choice? Given that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death in children at every age from 2-14, shouldn&#x27;t the WHO recommend that everyone move out of the suburbs into cities where they don&#x27;t have to drive?",1387206584

So, in a general sense, self-regulating features of an economy (eg, transparency) create a &quot;remedy&quot; for otherwise more expensive-to-monitor arrangements. By increasing the opporunity set of remedies, your system optimizes to a lower-cost-base. That is to say, a &#x27;remediable&#x27; inefficiency is different than one which there is no better option. The idea is that credit cards are a net-postive addition vs cash, because they create benefits to the consumer. These benefits are also the reason why the merchants pay (rents) to the CC companies. The &quot;lost business&quot; would be greater than if they did not exist. But again, here you are seeing the level of CC payments is a function of value added and costs avoided.

Public outrage over &quot;collateral damage&quot; is negligible, because frankly, there is no public outrage about civilian deaths. Especially if &quot;suspected Al-Qaeda operatives&quot; were among the killed.",1387206073

You can&#x27;t achieve <i>good</i> through coercion. Whenever you try, it has the opposite effect.<p>Take minimum wage for example. You want poor people to get higher salaries, but in reality, all you accomplish by raising the min. wage is preventing some lowest-skilled people from getting a job (which contributes to economic stagnation too, ofc).",1387206038

6012023,comment,6007650,6011823,1,0,beagle3,,,"> It&#x27;s hard to make that realtime, because you&#x27;d need to some sort of broadcast every second or at least every few seconds.<p>Twitter isn&#x27;t realtime either - they say they don&#x27;t succeed to stay within the 5 seconds all the time, and when Gaga tweets it takes up to 5 minutes.<p>Furthermore, I was talking about broadcasting a request for updates on demand when needed. PGM/UDP can blast through hundreds of megabytes per second on gigabit connection. That&#x27;s quite easy. 22MB/sec is nothing, even 100MB/sec is not much these days (though you might have to bond/team to make that reliable)<p>> It&#x27;s hard to follow a lot of people (you could be getting a large number of replies), so there would need be a follow limit.<p>Not at all. Make the replies (at most) 5 tweets from each person you follow, with a &quot;and there&#x27;s more ...&quot; flag in the reply, have the front end ask for more if it makes sense once the 50ms is done.<p>It&#x27;s ok if the 300 people who follow one million people take 200ms instead of 50ms to get a reply. And if you want to make it quicker for them, have these ones (and only these ones) on a &quot;push&quot; rather than &quot;pull&quot; model. The vast majority of people follow less than 50 people, perhaps less than 20.<p>> Facebook has a follow limit and people don&#x27;t really expect Facebook to be realtime - the central bit is not really.<p>People do expect facebook to be realtime, it mostly delivers (better than twitter), their limits are not hard (I know people who asked and got them lifted within a few minutes).<p>> Also, there is no one right way to do these things, in my view.<p>No, but there&#x27;s a lot of wrong ways, and twitter keeps choosing among them.",1373367212

6012015,comment,6011263,6011263,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"Nostalgia is also one of the most powerful economic drivers, tied in with social class and prestige. This might make it seem like it concerns only marketers, but it actually affects all of us. It determines how the schools we attended, the cities we lived in, and the jobs we held will be evaluated by others. Ivy League colleges (the oldest) are well-regarded because of a self-perpetuating loop (strong reputation => good professors and students => strong reputation) rooted in nostalgia. Same with star cities. People would rather relive New York&#x27;s 403-year history or San Francisco&#x27;s gold rushes than that of a no-name city (est. 1894) where the quality of life might be just as good.<p>Even Silicon Valley is waist-deep in the stream of nostalgia. Its glory days of 1970-99 have been re-erected, Disney-style, in the current VC-funded world which now provides second acts for fired investment bankers and private equity people who&#x27;ve decided to play startup for a few years. The winners and losers and stars have already been worked out, the equity slices are calibrated in management&#x27;s favor, but it&#x27;s a very <i>successful</i> theme park.<p>Nostalgia is like romantic love or religious faith; it might be good for you on the whole, but you have to treat all the decisions that come out of it with heightened skepticism. It&#x27;s selective (people remember the good, not the bad) and that&#x27;s well-documented, but it&#x27;s also <i>oblique</i> insofar as people compare what they have in the present to what <i>the elite</i> had in the past. It can carry a reactionary impetus because people mistakenly believe they&#x27;d have a better life if the past were restored than what they&#x27;d actually get. In the U.S., we&#x27;re paying for the &quot;elitism is sexy again&quot; Reagan Era 1980s, which was a clever way for the old upper class (the one that murdered strikers in the 1900s, tanked the economy in the &#x27;20s and was emasculated by the New Deal) to reacquire its old ways of doing things. Those yuppies turned out <i>not</i> to make it into the new robber baron class; they were useful idiots for the new upper class that turned out to be the grandchildren of the old one.<p>Nostalgia has some value, for sure. Its focus on tradition gives us a community, a historical narrative, and a place that need not be explicitly religious. It can bring us a focus on excellence by reminding us of less cluttered (perhaps in imagination only) times. However, it can also result in some <i>terrible</i> decision-making, and there&#x27;s the rub.",1373367068

If you read Satoshi&#x27;s original paper, the probability of someone with substantially less than 50% of the total compute power decreases exponentially as the number of confirmations increases. The reason Bitcoin uses 6 confirmations is because this was judged to give the best balance between time taken to confirm and probability of a sub-50% attacker succeeding.<p>It has nothing to do with stopping attacks by someone with a majority of the total compute power - realistically, if requring someone to dedicate that amount of compute power for 12 minutes isn&#x27;t enough to make an attack infeasable, making them dedicate it for 2 hours is unlikely to do the job either.<p>Edit: Also, requiring only one confirmation - which is what you&#x27;d have to do to make Bitcoin as fast as 6 confirmations in  Primecoin - is especially risky because it allows any attacker capable of generating a block in a reasonable amount of time to double-spend with very high probability at the cost of one block&#x27;s payout.",1373366839

6011974,comment,6010805,6011356,2,0,pron,,,"I&#x27;d like to say something that may sound a bit controversial, but bear with me: for most practical programs, Java&#x27;s performance beats C++; in fact, it beats C. And assembly. There, I&#x27;ve said it, and now let me try to back this up.<p>Proving my claim is very hard, but I&#x27;ll try to persuade you. The task is made harder by the fact that for <i>every possible</i> Java program, there exists a C++ program that performs the exact same task at least as fast as Java (proof by example: the JVM).<p>And yet, Java is the best performing programming environment in existence (well, in widespread use; there may be runtimes I&#x27;m not aware of). How is that possible? When we say that one language or environment is faster than another, do we mean that there exists a string of characters in that language that would produce a faster executable? If that is what we mean, then yes, C++ is faster than Java. But I think the question is not whether that desired program exists, but whether <i>you can write it</i>. To that question, I think the answer is no in most circumstances, especially when it comes to large programs.<p>Why? because when you write a large, hopefully maintainable, C++ program, you must make use of language features that are hard for the compiler to optimize, most notably -- virtual methods. The JVM JIT does runtime compilation, so it inlines virtual calls, and de-optimizes them if its assumptions are shown to be false. Method inlining is the most important compiler optimization because it opens to door to all kinds of other optimizations like lock elision, scalarization of objects and more.<p>And there&#x27;s another issue. What do we mean by performance nowadays? It&#x27;s not too hard for a single-threaded C++ program to beat a similar Java program (provided that the program is not large, and does not make use of virtual methods). But modern hardware is multi- and many-core, and most scalable lock-free algorithms absolutely require a good GC in order to function well. Java probably has (several of) the most advanced GC(s) in wide use.<p>To sum up: C++ can beat Java in small benchmarks, but Java will beat C/C++ in most large, real-world programs; and if the program is heavily multi-threaded, Java has even more of an edge.",1373366305

Surely people who are not terrorists using security measures is <i>exactly</i> what&#x27;s needed, so that security measures become normalized and the web&#x27;s vulnerability to malicious actors is lowered.

6011893,comment,6011559,6011559,12,0,derda,,,"I see it more as a failure of subsidies. Those companies were built for the sole purpose of grabbing government money. Not only is the installation of solar panels highly subsidized in Germany, these companies were often also founded in economically poor regions in eastern Germany which would grant further support. A few years ago there was a real alternative energy goldrush, companies expanded quickly, IPOs happened etc. . The money was plenty and the companies lived well of it. Then the Chinese catched up, and afaik there was/is no real reason to not buy the Chinese product since the German companies had no real advance in quality or technology (maybe they did not innovate, since they thought they were in a comfortable position?). Now the subsidies for installations would go to China. So basically the tax money supposed to prop up German industries supports a Chinese price-dumping scheme. And if that was not worse enough our energy prices are rising and rising (I think I pay about 0,25 / kWh) (about a third of it is going to alternative energy subsidies).

Perhaps (probably) if I went and read Cantor&#x27;s original work, I would be satisfied. But perhaps you can save me the trouble.<p>Here is my problem. You actually can&#x27;t pair up the reals with the integers, simply because the reals cannot be enumerated. If you take two sets whose members actually can be enumerated, you can pair them up up long as you want.<p>To reiterate: I&#x27;m claiming that the &quot;pairing&quot; operation is not defined validly here, because it would rely on enumerating the elements of both sets, which you cannot do for the reals.

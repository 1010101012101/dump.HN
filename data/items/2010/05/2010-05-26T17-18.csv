This is especially the case when provably-local allocations can be put onto a thread-local heap, and you only do stop-the-thread GC on those. So, in the absolute sense, stop-the-world GC overhead is lower than incremental, low-latency GC.<p>But yes, we have GC that is fairly responsive these days, too, for when throughput isn't the driving concern.",1274896764

It can be an important step towards creating something tangible, but as it has no deadlines and imposes no constraints, it has limited utility. Design is all about making tough choices about what to include, what to leave out, and why.<p>My suggestion--and I am no expert on writing programming languages or creating anything--is to borrow something from Paul Graham and recast your project as an attempt to answer a question. For example:<p><i>Probe is an attempt to answer the question ""Does an operator syntax for mapping and folding functions make code easier to read?""</i><p>Good luck!",1274896721

1380989,comment,1380517,1380517,0,0,macrael,,,"<i>But to regard hubris as “playing God” is, first, a modern perspective, and second, a secular one.</i><p>This seems true; the ""God"" invoked in this phrase is not the religious God but more the God represented by nature and that sense of the natural order. I think that the reason this notion has become popular in recent history is that it is only in the last hundred years or so that our technology has advanced to the point where we can really fundamentally disrupt the balance created here by four and a half billion years of evolution. I'm not sure it is fair to single out creating life as especially dangerous as, to me, there are many abilities we have that wield similar amounts of power. I think of cane toads in Australia and the oil spill in the gulf and climate change. All of these are evidence of hubris, of mistakes with long term consequences and few good solutions.<p>Creating and modifying life (something we have been in the business of doing for quite some time) does fit into this category. We are messing with with incredibly complex systems we don't near fully understand. It's science and it's exciting and we are advancing our knowledge but the possible consequences are indeed dire. I'm not trying to preach anti-technology or anything and I don't think that the fact that we are indeed ""playing God"" should stop us from pursuing this research and these ideas. But I do think that it is something to be mindful of. We only have the one earth.<p>EDIT: hugh3 said it better than I did: '""Playing God"" to me is just a turn of phrase, shorthand (and somewhat cliched) for ""messing with powers beyond your understanding or ability to control"".'",1274896625

1380977,comment,1380381,1380381,0,0,omd,,,"I was in the exact same situation years ago after starting a company with a longtime friend. The company was growing like crazy, but then my partner wanted to slow it down to spend more time with his family. Everyone I talked to (an investor, lawyer, friends) agreed he was holding the company back and should leave, but it wouldn't be easy. It would have been difficult and costly because he was a shareholder as well as one of the lead technicians.<p>Finally, someone explained it to me from a different perspective: If my partner didn't want to leave then I was the one with the problem, not him. Instead of looking at what I was missing by him being there (a fact I couldn't get around), I should look at what I could be doing on my own without him. I talked to my partner about it and we agreed I would leave and keep some of my shares instead of a buy-out which the company couldn't afford at the time.<p>8 years later he's still running the company the way it was after I left. I sold my shares to a new partner for a price that was many times what I would have received if I was bought out when I left. In the past years I've been able to build a company like I envisioned the first time, sold it and am now in the process of repeating that for a second time.<p>Looking back I've come much further than I would have if I stayed at the company.

A very good argument in why 10 is not enough is Woolrych and Cockton 2001. They point out an issue in Nielsen formula (1-(1-0.31)^5) in that he does not take into account the visibility of an issue. They show using only 5 users can significantly under count even significant usability issues.<p>The number of users you need is dependent on how many issues there are, the cultural variance of your user base, and the margin of error you are happy with. Five users or even 10 is not enough on a modern well designed web site.<p>For example if we assume that designers of a web site have been using good design principles and therefore an issue only effects 2.5% of users. Then 10 users in a test will only discover that issue 22% of the time. If your site attracts a 1 million visitors a year the issue will mean that 25,000 people will experience problems.<p>The easy way to think of a Usability Test is a treasure hunt. If the treasure is very obvious then you will need fewer people, if less obvious then you will need more people. If you increase the area of the hunt then you will need more people.

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship
  Censorship is the suppression of speech or deletion of communicative material which
  may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient to the
  government or media organizations

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations
  A statute of limitations is an enactment  in a common law legal system
</code></pre>
In short, some random dude on the street telling me to stfu doesn't qualify as free speech violation. It might be rude behavior and disruption of public peace or whatever, but definitely not free speech violation.<p>>> I don't see any reason to make an artificial cut between this sort of action, and a similar action by a government.<p>You can't arbitrarily decide that civilian threats and something like the great firewall of China are on the same level because they simply aren't. It's completely unfathomable to think that you could copy and paste the legislation for one and apply it to the other. That'd be like putting a single try/catch around the body of main and call it your exception handling framework :)<p>>> Even if you don't call it a violation of your right to free speech, it's still a bad thing<p>We agree there, but by your logic, any time someone says ""man , IE developers should die"" or whatever, they're basically the same as extremists. My beef is with people confusing threatening, actually killing and real oppression, and attempting to justify stupid actions by evoking a noble human right.<p>You can't just put the three in the same bucket and tell me that it's cool to troll millions of people that did nothing to you, when really, you just have a petty disagreement with some random guy that you don't even know.<p>The keyword you used that is central to all of this was ""fear"". Emotions tend to cloud logical judgement very fast. Look at the TSA. And ask yourself: do you really think you're safer or more free after EDMD?<p>(Oh, and for the record, I don't believe in Libertarianism)",1274894578

Layoffs of workers with obsolete working skills can be one price of new innovations valued by consumers. Though a continually innovating economy generates new opportunities for workers to participate in more creative and productive enterprises (provided they can acquire the necessary skills), creative destruction can cause severe hardship in the short term, and in the long term for those who cannot acquire the skills and work experience.
However, in the long-term society as a whole (including the descendants of those that experienced short-term hardship) enjoys a rise in overall quality of life due to the accumulation of innovation - for example, 90% of Americans were farmers in 1790, while 2.6% of Americans were farmers in 1990[9]. Over those 200 years farm jobs were destroyed by exponential productivity gains in agricultural technology and replaced by jobs in new industries.

You don't know that and you can't know that. You don't seem to realize that the kinds of language features that enable metaprogramming, also limit the maximum theoretical speed of your implementation.<p>Secondly, you've failed to distinguish this language from Ruby. You've turned map() into a digraph operator that feeds sideways. Okay? Why do I care?<p>Spewing out some pseudocode doesn't make people care what you have to say, you need to better explain what makes it <i>different</i> from other languages, not what makes it similar.<p>I don't care if it's similar to ruby. I'll just use ruby if it's that similar.<p>I hope your next post is more substantial.",1274893472

It's really unlike any Java framework I've ever worked with, and I've been doing Java for far too long. It automatically reloads your changes without a compile...it makes great use of annotations, and it uses Groovy for the templating language, it comes with support by default for the big three IDEs (Netbeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ) although you can easily be happy with vim, emacs, or tm. After a bit of time, it's easy to forget you're actually working with Java.<p>Also, if you know Rails, you essentially know Play. The concepts are the same, the directory structure is the same. You're learning the Java version of Rails, so there are differences, but my years of Rails development experience made picking up play a breeze.<p>edit: clarified API comment",1274893442

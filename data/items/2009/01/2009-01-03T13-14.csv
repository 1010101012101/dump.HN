1) Based on the links in the threads as on 3rd Jan, 13:30 GMT
2) Links by some individual users were uniformly spread over the year but collectively it can be seen that it is not the case.<p>Some arguments against my hypothesis,
1) The test would be itself biased if not quite a lot of commentators joined HN before Jan 1 2008.
2) Same goes if increasingly more stories are being published per day since the start.<p>More info on recency bias:

Producing a great piece of software was never the intent. The PC manufacturers held up their end of the deal by licensing Windows in large quantities.<p>That business model is mature, played out, and dying. APPL would be making a mistake if it adopted the same model for OSX. They've got to continue milking the superior product for smarter users angle for both OS and hardware if they want to continue gaining market share.<p>Nothing wrong with making OSX a little more WSB I guess, but the value of OSX is that it sells APPL hardware and nobody else's.",1230990118

So I don't see them making an acquisition that would at a stroke have their fingers in so many pies.",1230989834

AIR<p>Many companies are finding that their clients are interacting in a dynamic way with air, including breathing and moving through it, expect this exciting trend to continue through '09.<p>2. MONITORS<p>From advertising to socializing, there are many online communities finding ways of analyzing data and experiencing graphic interfaces by using graphics and text displayed on a monitor.

418356,comment,417628,417628,0,0,ShardPhoenix,,,"I always thought something like this would be a good idea, but it still requires the people you know to actually use it, which tends to be the sticking point.<p>Also, there's a significant risk that if people are shy enough to use this rather than asking someone out directly, they'll still be too shy to openly talk about it with the other person even after receiving the notice of mutual attraction. I actually had that happen with a similar feature on OKCupid (where you rate people on looks/personality, and if you have a mutually high rating, it notifies you both). I think it might be related to the game theoretical concept of common knowledge (<a href=""http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/CommonKnowledge.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/CommonKnowledge.html</a>) (vs. mere mutual knowledge), or something along those lines.",1230989525
418355,comment,416875,416951,0,0,jrockway,,,">  One missing equals symbol and every Zune in the world froze.<p>Wrong.  Completely ignoring all software engineering ""best practices"" was the problem.  They could have reused a working library.  They could have written unit tests tests.  QA could have tested it.  Other developers could have reviewed it, or written test cases without knowledge of how the code worked.<p>Basically, they ignored every rule for writing good code, and then ended up with a serious bug.  Well, yeah.  The whole ""unit testing"" ""fad"" exists for a reason -- it greatly improves the quality of software.<p>Many people take software development seriously enough to not let one brain fart cause a piece of software to brick thousands of devices.",1230989349

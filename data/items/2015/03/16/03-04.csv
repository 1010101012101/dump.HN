9209761,comment,9207073,9208406,0,0,bloaf,,,"I think that in science there is an inherent tension between what scientists know and what what the public knows.<p>Scientific knowledge is covered in asterisks.  To read and understand science typically requires an extensive amount of background knowledge; without that it is very easy to misinterpret the strength, significance, or applicability of a scientific finding.  Many of the asterisks are themselves scientific conclusions with their own set of asterisks.<p>The public, at least in areas which are not immediately relevant to daily life, cannot be assumed to have that background knowledge.  Therefore, the tension is essentially this:  How can scientists make people aware of (or interested in) scientific knowledge if they have to strip out all the asterisks when talking to them?<p>Making science into a <i>catechism</i> is simply one solution to the above problem.  Ignore the asterisks and turn the fundamental findings of physics and chemistry into dogma and dispense it as gospel truth.  <i>I actually am somewhat o.k. with this.</i>  Sure, Joe Public might come away with an over-simplified and over-confident knowledge about what science says, but I think that a clumsy knowledge of scientific facts is better than the impression that scientific knowledge is arcane and out of reach.  After all, it is highly unlikely that Joey P. will find himself in a situation where it is very important for him to really understand all the subtleties behind his k-8 scientific knowledge, but that knowledge is likely to come in handy.<p>The only <i>problems</i> with the science-as-religion solution are a potential &quot;loss of faith&quot; and the perception of arbitrarity with regards to scientific findings. The first can easily happen when someone learns about a new  finding which contradicts the dogmatic version of science but is entirely consistent with the heavily asterisked <i>actual</i> scientific consensus.  The second problem is basically &quot;rejectability;&quot; if people think that science is a set of arbitrary rules, then they are free to reject them the same way they would reject other religions.",1426478360

9209753,comment,9208644,9208644,0,0,kevin_nisbet,,,"One thing I wish they had talked about, was about applying Random Early Detection (RED) to this problem. It seems to be, that RED, while an older technique, was created for exactly this purpose, and is supported in every IP router I&#x27;ve ever worked with. Perhaps there are challenges applying RED here, but I would suspect that if introduced it would also have considerable improvements to the internet performance for those islands.<p>Now, the solution presented, could be superior to RED, but based on what they&#x27;ve shown, I&#x27;m not entirely convinced. It is an intriguing solution though.<p>Also, an important takeaway they presented, that translates to other software tasks, is that increasing the buffer often makes the situation worse. One thing you can look into, is the research currently underway into buffer bloat, and the suspected impacts it is believed to be having on consumer internet service. My understanding is it appears to be caused by this exact phenomenon, where engineers from equipment manufactures and telecom operators reacted to the problem by drastically increasing buffer sizes.<p>*Please be aware, I work for a large telecom operator in Canada, but the views are my own and do not reflect any position of my employer.",1426478256

9209732,comment,9208501,9209522,0,0,ekimekim,,,"Rabbitmq has at-least-once semantics (unless requeue = false, in which case all bets are off, since you could get a message multiple times due to cluster partitions^ or not at all due to a drop without requeue. Note that unlike disque, requeue is set on a rejection/recovery operation, not on a message).<p>It has transactional publishing (which not all clients support as the Confirm method is non-standard) and uses a per-queue leader election so all publishes have to go to the master queue, guaranteeing ordering. However, requeued messages have undefined order. However however, all messages with the requeued flag unset still have strict ordering relative to each other.<p>Messages are only removed when acked. If I understand correctly, disque will report back a message publish failure in an OOM condition, whereas RabbitMQ will simply refuse to read from the connection and make TCP do the publisher throttle work, which is a massive hack that occasionally causes problems. I prefer disque&#x27;s method, especially since clients should never be deluded into thinking a publish can&#x27;t fail for other reasons.<p>Overall, the main differences between this and rabbitmq, from my reading, are:<p>* RabbitMQ has stronger ordering guarentees...until your message gets requeued, in which case things get more complex.<p>* Disque has a clearer clustering story, stating outright that it is AP. However, this means that messages might or might not always reach their destination, producing (as the grandparent comment calls it) &quot;lonely widows&quot;. RabbitMQ can be CP or AP depending on configuration, but its CP mode is somewhat fraught with pitfalls and strange performance issues (as I have personally experienced in production).<p>* RabbitMQ has the advantage of the whole suite of AMQP features: exchanges, headers, routing rules, as well as some non-standard ones like federation, dead letter queueing. Of course, complexity comes at a cost, and Disque is considerably simpler.<p>* RabbitMQ supports per-message durability and per-queue mirroring options. This reflects its history as a single-node application which had clustering added later. I prefer Disque&#x27;s approach of always-clustered with the option to write to disk (especially having that option only apply on graceful restart).<p>Overall, I might use Disque for high throughput applications where I don&#x27;t mind messages rarely being lost, such as metrics. However, the AP semantics worry me. Dissatisfied as I am with Rabbit&#x27;s CP mode, it&#x27;s still my preferred option of these two in most use-cases.<p>^ (edit) As the sibling comment notes, the default mode for clustering is AP and message can be lost (this is the same as disque). A few times in my original post I accidentally defaulted to talking about its CP mode, which is the only mode I&#x27;ve used (IMO, the only mode that should be used).",1426477967

The original article is about someone&#x27;s rent increasing by over 400%.  I can&#x27;t imagine how that could be justified by cost increases on the landlord&#x27;s side.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that the current system of rent control and property tax increase limits is working properly and is the best way to do things.<p>At any rate, you&#x27;re re-framing the argument here to try to make me look bad.  Your original question asked about landlords making 10x of their <i>existing</i> profit.  If the landlord is already making a profit (which was the premise of your question), clearly they&#x27;re not having issues making money in a rent-control+prop 13 environment.  There are many multipliers between 0x and 10x, and I would argue that the responsible multiplier in order to maintain non-asshole status is well below 10... and even well below 1... but certainly greater than 0.<p>Just to be clear, though, to reiterate my initial point and make my position clear: if you&#x27;re making a $500 profit off a $2000 monthly rental, and decide that you can and should make $5000 (a 10x increase in profit) by raising the rent to $7000, if that&#x27;s at the expense of the renter&#x27;s ability to pay... yes, it is my opinion that you&#x27;re an asshole.

The people who dream up rent control somehow never realize that property owners will change their behavior based on how they expect rent control to affect them.  So, when a tenant moves out, for whatever reason, the property owner doesn&#x27;t set rent based on the current economy, instead rent is based on what the market might look like years down the line.<p>So, after a few years, rent control effectively guarantees that no apartment is available at an affordable price. At least, you have to live in a controlled apartment for a few years for inflation to erode the value of money you send your landlord every month enough that you can feel like the apartment is affordable.  And, of course, the people moving from one rent controlled apartment to another are affected by the market distortion as much as anyone else.<p>And places all over the world manage to provide affordable housing without rent control, so long as they allow their housing markets to work.",1426477294

As a landlord -- assuming a world with absolute property rights -- you have a significant power advantage over your tenant.  A 3x-4x rent increase is not treating your tenant as a &quot;trading partner&quot;, it&#x27;s using your status as landowner to your enrichment and their detriment.<p>Further up you suggest:<p><i>A group that votes to dictate what I can do with my property might be doing it by the letter of the law, but that doesn&#x27;t make it morally right</i><p>Not inherently, no.  That&#x27;s only the case if you believe that the voting-majority group is immoral.  That certainly can be the case, but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the case often enough to abandon the idea of democracy.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m definitely in favor of limiting property rights.  Property is in general not a fungible &quot;product&quot;, and its supply is limited.  I consider land to be a public good.  The state grants you some property rights, but reserves to place some restrictions on what you can do with the property in the name of the public good.  I don&#x27;t think we have the balance down perfectly yet, but I would absolutely not advocate giving property owners carte blanche to do whatever they want with that property.<p>It&#x27;s a matter of drawing the line <i>somewhere</i>: I think you might agree that some restrictions are good.  Disallowing renting decisions based on discrimination of protected classes is something we might agree is a good thing (sorry, I don&#x27;t mean to state your position for you, but I don&#x27;t know you, so I&#x27;m just stating a hope, a guess, as to somewhere we might find common ground).  If we <i>can</i> take that as a given, then we can agree that the state restricting property owners to some extent does indeed make sense.  And from there it&#x27;s finding a list of things that it&#x27;s ok to restrict, and it&#x27;s not ok to restrict.  From this discussion I&#x27;d guess that my list of things that it&#x27;s ok to restrict is a bit longer than yours.  And that&#x27;s ok, but at least it&#x27;s a starting point from which to find a compromise.  The final list has more on it than you want, and less on it than I want.<p>Business deals and compromise are rarely about making one or the other party (or both) 100% happy.  I believe there&#x27;s &quot;common wisdom&quot; floating around that the best deal is one that both sides are slightly uncomfortable with, and I believe that to be pretty true.<p>If, on the other hand, you do truly believe in giving property owners absolute power and free reign to do whatever they want with it, then I don&#x27;t know that we can actually have a productive discussion, because our viewpoints may just be too different.  That&#x27;s unfortunate, but that happens sometimes.",1426476178

9209564,comment,9207594,9208737,0,0,ThatGeoGuy,,,"Thanks for the response. I definitely know about Numpy, it&#x27;s currently what I use instead of lisp / scheme, mostly because it&#x27;s currently the least painful way to do numerical computing (in my opinion, that is). Unfortunately, Python is not a lisp (and yes, I know of Hy) which does bring forth it&#x27;s own limitations.<p>The biggest concern I have with re-implementing Numpy in Scheme / Lisp is that it&#x27;s very object oriented. Certainly, many of the ufunc methods in Numpy can be composed or chained in a very functional style, but at its core Numpy is Pythonic, and Pythonic code means using OOP for abstraction. Mainly, I&#x27;m concerned with how one actually transfers this over into Lisp like languages. Sure, CHICKEN has coops, Guile has goops, which are basically Common Lisps&#x27; CLOS, but taking the concept of Numpy and expressing it in a CLOS-like system sometimes just feels wrong.<p>That said, I think the guys behind clojure.core.matrix have done some work facing similar challenges, but I don&#x27;t really know enough to evaluate if they&#x27;ve done the right thing. Moreover, Clojure itself almost makes this job easier, because it has interfaces / protocols from the get-go, whereas Scheme and CL don&#x27;t quite share the same properties.<p>In any case, thanks again for your reply. If you ever write anything regarding those 4 rewrites, or if you have written anything regarding your decisions on refactoring and improving an API, I&#x27;d love to read it. I know a lot of people hold Numpy up as a gold standard, but I still find it very hard to put in explicit terms what makes programming with Numpy arrays more pleasant than using MATLAB arrays, Eigen (C++) matrices / vectors, or other similar systems.",1426475086

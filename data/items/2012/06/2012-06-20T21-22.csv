4139336,comment,4136752,4138890,3,0,davesims,,,"""All in all, the sweeping generalization about the concrete languages was introduced by you.""<p>I think the plain, direct language of the paper's conclusion is clear enough without me having to embellish it, and without its defenders extrapolating all of the qualifications and subtexts that they think I missed. You really don't have much to work with, because the paper's clumsy conclusion is small, blunt and unqualified in its scope. It takes a handful of small Python programs translated to an idiosyncratic language like Haskell and concluded:<p>""in practice [dynamic typing with unit testing] is an inadequate replacement for static type checking.""<p>This is unequivocal language. There's no qualifications about language, context, or any kind of variables that might possibly dilute the strength of the conclusion.<p>On the other hand, Peter Cooper gives a great example elsewhere on this thread of a much better paper with much broader scope, more stats, and much more modest, qualified conclusions. This is the kind of language that is useful and gives me confidence that the authors didn't start out with an axe to grind and merely followed what metrics they had to the warranted conclusion, no more, no less:<p>""Even though the experiment seems to suggest that static typing has no positive impact on development time, it must not be forgotten that the experiment has some special conditions: the experiment was a one-developer experiment. Possibly, static typing has a positive impact in larger projects where interfaces need to be shared between developers. Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that previous experiments showed a positive impact of static type systems on development time.""<p><a href=""http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse590n/10au/hanenberg-oopsla2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse590n/10au/...</a>",1340229585

4139317,comment,4136752,4136991,2,0,tikhonj,,,"An interesting thought: a good type system can actually make a language <i>more</i> expressive.<p>A perfect example is QuickCheck. QuickCheck allows you to write complicated tests very simply by relying on the type system. You just write out the invariant and the type system automatically figures out which random generators to use to run the tests.<p>QuickCheck has been ported to a bunch of other languages, but it's more complex and seems harder to use in dynamically typed languages as compared to Haskell.<p>A simpler example in the same vein is Haskell's read function. Essentially, read is the opposite of toString--it goes from a string to some value. The beauty is that you never need to specify what type you're parsing; it can figure out what type it needs to be thanks to the type system. So instead of having a bunch of functions like parseDouble and parseInt, you have a single read function. This also makes the library prettier by maintaining the symmetry between show and read (toString and fromString).",1340229210

Is it possible to draw conclusions about the class of type systems labelled ""static typing"" vs dynamic typing by using a small sample of programs? I think this is where the impedence mismatch is occurring. The author seems to take static typing to mean ""what can be currently accomplished through static typing"", and thus he was justified in using the strongest static type system in use to do the study. Taking it this way, then the study seems meaningful.<p>Taking the other meaning, the class of type systems labelled static typing, then you end up with a very large set of languages each with (perhaps) varying amounts of power. Doing a study with just one static language does seem inadequate. Although, depending on the class of errors caught, it may still be valid. As far as I've seen, Haskell doesn't catch new classes of errors that are impossible in other systems, it just makes it a lot easier to do so. So essentially Haskell has the same power as other common type systems. If this holds, then the study would still be valid.

At this point-or even earlier-it's important to get plugged into the Secret Paper Passing Network. This informal organization is where all the action in AI really is. Trend-setting work eventually turns into published papers-but not until at least a year after the cool people know all about it. Which means that the cool people have a year's head start on working with new ideas.<p>How do the cool people find out about a new idea? Maybe they hear about it at a conference; but much more likely, they got it through the Secret Paper Passing Network. Here's how it works. Jo Cool gets a good idea. She throws together a half-assed implementation and it sort of works, so she writes a draft paper about it. She wants to know whether the idea is any good, so she sends copies to ten friends and asks them for comments on it. They think it's cool, so as well as telling Jo what's wrong with it, they lend copies to their friends to Xerox. Their friends lend copies to their friends, and so on. Jo revises it a bunch a few months later and sends it to AAAI. Six months later, it first appears in print in a cut-down five-page version (all that the AAAI proceedings allow). Jo eventually gets around to cleaning up the program and writes a longer revised version (based on the feedback on the AAAI version) and sends it to the AI Journal. AIJ has almost two years turn-around time, what with reviews and revisions and publication delay, so Jo's idea finally appears in a journal form three years after she had it-and almost that long after the cool people first found out about it. So cool people hardly ever learn about their subfield from published journal articles; those come out too late.<p>You, too, can be a cool people. Here are some heuristics for getting connected: ...<p>TL;DR Academic papers are for presenting final results and assigning credit, not discussion.",1340226211

2872412,comment,2868593,2872056,3,0,arthurwellesley,,,"I don't know the particular study you are talking about, so it's hard for me to comment on it.<p>In the grand scheme of things, I'm inclined to agree that it's social control from families, neighborhoods, and governments that determines crime.  In the case of the decline of Detroit, the lack of social control was intricately tried to race in all sorts of way (ex. a history of societal neglect under Jim Crow that gave rise to an underclass culture, the black power movement that gave young black men a rationale for beating on whitey, racist policing that failed to police the black projects).  Again, we're not discussing race to lay blame, we're trying to understand what happened.  And in the context of this discussion, I had to emphasize and highlight the racial aspect, because the parent comment to my comment specifically denied that there was any racial aspect at all.<p>Imagine we are talking about slavery.  I can certainly imagine a study that proves that slavery is not innately based on race, but rather has to do with relations of power (black on black slavery in Africa was really common, white on white slavery used to be common in Europe, a few slaveholders in the antebellum south were black, slavery has been common in virtually all civilizations, etc).  Now imagine someone denies that ""whiteness"" had anything to do with slave owning in the American south, and that anyone who discusess it should be shunned.  Someone else replies extensively and highlights that slave owning and oppression of slaves in the American south of the 1800's was ""almost entirely white"" and was intricately tied to race.  Is that person racist against ""white"" people?  No.  Is that blaming all whites living now for what happened then?  No.  Should we not talk about the racial aspect of slavery, because some racist young black men might use it has a justification for violence?  No.  Understanding the racial aspect of slavery in that particular time is essential for understanding what happened in that time.  Similarly, understanding the racial aspect of crime in the 1960's and 1970's is essential for understanding what happened to Detroit.",1313063731

2872272,comment,2871649,2871649,1,0,mathattack,,,"The headline is a little more downbeat than the story, no?<p>As I read it, they say that private VC investment is moving from research to development.  This is consistent with the nature of VC funds - they usually have to pay back investor money within 7-10 years.  The research cycle in physical sciences is frequently long enough that adding development pushes the idea beyond 10 years.  As such, VCs are more interested in bringing already researched ideas (or incremental ideas) to market.<p>There are 2.5 antidotes to this:<p>1)  The government can fund more basic research, similar to biology.<p>2)  The government can put a revenue neutral tax on unclear energy.  (Carbon taxing) They can use to revenue to fund #1, or give it back in the form of lower taxes.  Even the latter will create financial incentives to fund alternatives.<p>2.5)  Fund longer term (10-15 year time horizon?) VC style investments with public funds, either through pensions or other dedicated funds.  This would be similar to Singapore.<p>I am fairly confident that #1 will help, as it benefits other areas in science.  There is potential for waste, but lots of residual benefits.  I am very confident that #2 will work, as it lines up everyone's incentives to solve the problems.  I am only slightly confident that #2.5 will work, as it is not a business model that has worked in many other places.",1313060673

They then used that to get record companies hooked as a small start up. The more they grew the more back catalogues and even indie artists got on board with them.<p>So now they have a proven platform, architecture and refined client and importantly a tested price model (like I said it has changed frequently to find the right form). So they felt ready to move to the US where there is a much larger audience. I believe they also secured a big investment to help too.<p>Add into that, the EU and UK do not have software patents, so it is much easier to make software over here than in the US. So of course as soon as Spotify go to the US they are under litigation from the software patent trolls.<p>As for unlimited music streaming, it used to be Naptsters legal business model a few years ago, but the internet just wasn't fast enough back then and they were blocked as there was only iPod and it had no apps.<p>Oh and what separates it from Grooveshark, Pandora or We7 you ask? It is their software client, it caches music, for fast access and less streaming, it can be used offline, and they have mobile versions for the $10 subs. HTH",1313060637

It essentially works by sending out white light and blocking selective spectra of light for each pixel. So even if a pixel is lit up, it should still be blocking or filtering most of the light that hits it and only letting through its particular color.<p>The better solution is to use LEDs or OLEDs. These do not require a backlight or any blocking but just generate the necessary color of light (and only the necessary color of light) from scratch.",1313060483

The UK housing bubble also burst. Japan had the same problem. And while the government was certainly <i>involved</i>, so was private industry and the general public. It doesn't prove ""government = bad"", that's just confirmation bias.<p>What it does prove is that you (the government, industry, or general population) shouldn't pour too much money into areas that show all the signs of a credit bubble.",1313060413

He definitely made at least parts for nuclear ""things"". He graduated from college in 1940-41 and went on to work for GE in their Neutron Devices Dept. It's those early years, the ""beginning years"" of the atomic age that I am fascinated by and want to hear his story... whether he was involved, even indirectly, in those developmental stages of the A-bomb. \nDoes anybody have good, solid questions that I can ask him to get his history without having him reveal any classified information? This is crucial to my family history.\nEdited to add that he did work for GE all his life but it's those first few years right out of college that I am missing.

It doesn't encourage Creative thinking and promote an intellectual environment.<p>There are many IT companies that fill this void by giving 6months intensive training because they know the education system.<p>Another social-cultural reason being - Indians are spoon feed-ed right from birth.

As a software developer, i've been hoping HTML5 would take off since I first learned about it.  However, in mobile, there seems to be a trend for hardware and software synergy.. a preference to really own the vertical stack and have full control over the experience and in order to build a great phone. On the native side, the titans of Google, Microsoft, and Apple all have their weight behind their own respective platforms.<p>While the community in software for HTML5 is strong, the reason i'm starting to bet against is because of the lack of love from the hardware side of things.  I'm not sure I can imagine a large existing company in hardware pushing HTML5 as far as its own native platform.  Without a phone or mobile device built and designed with HTML5 in mind, is it really possible for the fortress to crumble inside out?",1349333442

Sure, they're doing a great job building battery powered electric cars but personally I don't see how they can work for everyone in the same way that fossil fuel powered cars do today.<p>I'm driving a diesel (being european this isn't too odd) and I'm driving a lot of long distances. The beauty about the fossil fuel powered car is, that I can drive some 800km on a tank, stop for fuel which takes me about 5 minutes and then carry on. Tesla claims a 3-3.5h charge time. Even if the range was the same, which it isn't, this just isn't gonna work for anyone who drives across a country rather than through cities. To this day I haven't heard of any battery powered car that is charging in acceptable time compared to filling up a fuel tank.<p>Don't get me wrong, in a way I like electric motors. The torque they produce is amazing! What bothers me is the use of batteries. The technology I personally saw most potential in was the use of hydrogen fuel cells. The tank is filled with hydrogen, the fuel cell powers the electric motor. I'm not for a second suggesting hydrogen is a good ""fuel"" in the sense that we can just dig it up somewhere and get additional energy. What hydrogen is good at though, is storing energy and because filling a tank with it happens in a matter of minutes it's a whole lot better than carrying thousands of laptop batteries in your car.",1349332979

The engineering courses were similar though - you could find a talented student/graduate who would make your projects for you at a price.<p>This is still nothing, because every year there is a scandal where the question papers are leaked for almost every exam. This is constant.<p>People will find a bribe-able teacher or peon and get X or Y exam paper from them. Again constant and ongoing.

The first symbol is what you get with no modifiers; the second is with shift; the third is with Mode_switch (or AltGr, depending) and the fourth is with Shift and AltGr. There's sometimes although a 5-8, but that varies by platform and I haven't done enough experiments to really nail down what those are for linux these days, OR if those are tied to mod1/mod2/etc. instead of shift/altgr/mode_switch or specific modifiers like that.<p>Anyway, all the keysyms always defined the first three anyway (no modifiers, shift, and Mode_switch) and some defined the fourth. I don't have or use a Mode_switch key (yet) but I may try that out as a 'Greek' key or such, but since 90% of the time I'm programming I'm not sure if I'd ever use it.<p>My lines above defines parenleft as the symbol to send if key 50 (the left shift key) is pressed while the shift modifier is active. So, I can use the right shift to turn on the shift modifier, and then left shift turns into a left parenthesis key. Similarily, I can use the left shift key to turn the right shift into a right parenthesis.<p>So, to type a pair of parenthesis back to back ""()"" I press right shift, press left shift, release right shift, and tap right shift.

My git-onNotify [0] script detects a change and issues ""make show"". The Makefile uses rubber or latexmk to build a pdf, then issues ""gnome-open $PDF"", which opens the new version in my pdf viewer. If my screen is tiled, the preview on the side just updates.<p>Essentially, I just save my tex file and wait for the change.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/beza1e1/dot/blob/master/bin/git-onNotify"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/beza1e1/dot/blob/master/bin/git-onNotify</a>",1349330890

Worst memories?"" came up as a prompt under ""Life"". There's something amusing about this question being posed so innocently after ""Did you have a pet?"".<p>Anyway I think the site is actually pretty fun, and I'm glad I signed up despite not being able to tell what it was just from the homepage (might want to change that). I was just about to go to bed and jot down a few things I wanted to write about the coming morning but after poking around I may just spend some more time poking around with some of the topics here.",1349330828

4611113,comment,4610739,4610867,-1,0,31reasons,,,"I think there is a fundamental flaw in your argument. You are complaining about the world and giving it a power to be your ""selector"". You are waiting for the world to select you. Businesses are businesses and like it or not they only care about their bottom line. It does not matter whether you have a degree or a high school drop out as long as you make them money. Its bad that you are waiting for someone else to recognize your talents or anyone else's. Take matters in your hands. Do anything but don't complain about the world. Its not going to change for YOU.<p>and frankly if someone is smart enough to play politics and get the business done by being a manager, why shouldn't they get rewarded ?<p>I am technically strong and loved every project I did in collage but I also recognize the value of business people and their marketing and sales skills. Learn from them and be good in business and engineering.",1349330719

No. More often than not, students end up doing projects ""suggested"" by these project-making companies. They already have a bunch of ""Student Database Management System"" and ""Hospital Record Management System"" projects lying around which they rehash.<p>3. This already happens to an extent. People who work in these low paying jobs end up getting some experience and move onto better paying jobs. But like I said in (2) above, what they get to do are hardly any fun stuff",1349330572

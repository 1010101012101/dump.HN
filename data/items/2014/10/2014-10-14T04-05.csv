Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Worse is Better&quot; page <a href=""https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html</a> concludes with:<p>&quot;You might think that by the year 2000 I would have settled what I think of worse is better - after over a decade of thinking and speaking about it, through periods of clarity and periods of muck, and through periods of multi-mindedness on the issues. But, at OOPSLA 2000, I was scheduled to be on a panel entitled &quot;Back to the Future: Is Worse (Still) Better?&quot; And in preparation for this panel, the organizer, Martine Devos, asked me to write a position paper, which I did, called &quot;Back to the Future: Is Worse (Still) Better?&quot; In this short paper, I came out against worse is better. But a month or so later, I wrote a second one, called &quot;Back to the Future: Worse (Still) is Better!&quot; which was in favor of it. I still can’t decide. Martine combined the two papers into the single position paper for the panel, and during the panel itself, run as a fishbowl, participants routinely shifted from the pro-worse-is-better side of the table to the anti-side. I sat in the audience, having lost my voice giving my Mob Software talk that morning, during which I said, &quot;risk-taking and a willingness to open one’s eyes to new possibilities and a rejection of worse-is-better make an environment where excellence is possible. Xenia invites the duende, which is battled daily because there is the possibility of failure in an aesthetic rather than merely a technical sense.&quot;<p>Decide for yourselves.&quot;",1413262317

PCIe root has the ability to restrict transfer to a certain range and depending on system configuration there are remapping registers that translate between PCIe address and host memory address -- which you can fudge with to remap things how you like.<p>Firewire, was basically external PCIe (before there was PCIe) and you would be able to do DMA and there was a proof of concept of someone using an early iPod to read/write host memory.<p>You can&#x27;t with things like eSATA or USB. There is no DMA capability for the external device to exploit. The host controller (EHCI and alike) are the ones doing the DMAing. You can&#x27;t write directly to memory with those.

We use Pager Duty and it works well.  Since there is always a primary and secondary on call person, and the company is pretty small and technical, everyone feels &quot;responsible&quot; during their shifts, and at least one person is capable of handling rare, catastrophic events.  I often wonder which is more important: good docs on procedures for failure modes or a heightened sense of responsibility.  A good analogy may be the use of commercial airline pilots.  They can override autopilot, but I am told rarely do.  The safest airlines are good at maintaining their heightened sense of vigilance despite the lack of the need for it 99.999% of the time.",1413260163

8451945,comment,8450147,8451158,0,0,sleepydog,,,"> As an example, imagine you&#x27;re monitoring /. Nagios runs NRPE, NRPE looks at df /, and if it&#x27;s 85 percent full (by default), sends a warning page. At 90 percent it sends a critical page. A smarter system collects the df / results, delivers it to a central timeseries database. The new data point is used to create a new projection, and the new projection is used to determine the time to an actual failure. The system above might have an idea of how long it takes to respond, repair, and resolve and issue a page when the disk will fill up if not responded to within 4 hours. That&#x27;s the ideal solution, IMO.<p>We&#x27;ve actually implemented exactly this at my current workplace. We have a nagios check that queries graphite and calculates a &quot;days until full&quot; value, and alert based on that. We have similar checks for monitoring other infrastructure. These checks take a lot of work to get the right calculation and threshold values, but once they work, it&#x27;s pretty great.",1413260023

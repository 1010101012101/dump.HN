There are things that I have sold on craigslist and I knew that I would get more and sell it faster on ebay, but right then I just wanted to get it ""in the process"" of getting gone, and ebay is a pain.  It may be because of the computer or browser I use, but it is slow, it loads up all kinds of ads and kruft to show me what I want in a tiny 2 square inches in the center of my big monitor.<p>In fact, I would go further, and provide RSS feed interfaces and even a newsgroup interface ( not many people will use that, so maybe make a few million first).",1234025910

471228,comment,462118,466683,0,0,xiaoma,,,"China has far, far more 2nd language speakers than the US does.  Outside of Dongbei, it's a good bet that most over 50 speak Mandarin as a second language if at all.  A lack of capitalism held China back, not its writing system.  A fair comparison would be India, also a large country that's very divided linguistically.  Three decades ago, the average Indian was significantly wealthier than the average Chinese.  Both countries put a strong focus on education and both have been trying hard to modernize.  Now, China is far wealthier and has far higher literacy.<p>Also, consider Taiwan and Hong Kong.  Both went from being destitute to having higher per capita GDPs than Australia or many European states within the past generation or two.  The idea that characters ""hold"" people back is ridiculous.  Elementary school children here in Taiwan can read their native language as well if not better than their peers back in the states.  It would take quite a bit of evidence to make a strong case against characters.  Even MacArthur's misled experiment in Japan failed.  Simplifications were forced through and kanji were reduced, but people never stopped using them.  In fact, the Japanese have been using <i>more</i> kanji in general publication each decade since the end of the occupation.<p>As for the statistics, here they are:<p>CIA World Factbook \n<a href=""https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/</a>\nChina- literacy 90.9%, PPP GDP/person $6,100\nBrazil- literacy 88.6% PPP GDP/person $10,300\nIndia- literacy 61%  PPP GDP/person $2,900<p>Unicef gives similar rates.",1234025415

I'm sorry if my post sounded arrogant - I'm just trying to have some fun here.<p>I don't think I can really comprehend what any of your objections are, but I can certainly think of some major flaws in the toy argument I gave, and maybe these are what you were getting at even if you couldn't really articulate them.<p>first, just saying the state of a brain is the state of each synapse assumes a fixed topology of the brain.  This is obviously false - there is a lot of evidence that the topology of the brain is changed by experience e.g. the occular dominance columns.  Okay, so how much extra space would we need to deal with this - not that much actually: how much space do we need to store an arbitrary weighted directed graph with 10^11 nodes and 10^15 edges?  Well for each edge we need to know the two vertices and the weight.  Give each neuron a unique id and this requires about 10-12 bytes per synapse instead of 1.  This is only one order of magnitude difference between a fixed and arbitrary topology! And this is probably a gross overestimate of the storage space required because the topology of the nervous system is <i>far</i> from arbitrary - after all the thing is generated by a genetic code of very modest size.  See my posts on why the large search space doesn't kill attempts to solve protein folding.<p>Obviously I ignore the functioning of the glia - I know for a fact that these are very important for the growth and development of the brain but I'm not sure they are the critical part of its computational function.  If you know otherwise please point me to some references, I would love to know!<p>The reason that I mentioned the speed difference of electronics and neurons is that this is what makes it possible to update the state of those 10^15 synapses in real time.  Of course it would be wasteful to use the standard PC architechture for this process, but still.<p>Hope this helps clear things up.",1234024843

471217,comment,470695,470764,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Don't be <i>too</i> fooled by marketing. Just because pure research doesn't come with all the glitter and flash of applied research doesn't mean it's not there. Remember: Every Macbook sold is an advertisement for the transistor, but there's no product that advertises Andrew Wiles, apart from a few math books. But that doesn't mean the genius isn't out there. He may be sitting at the table right next to you!<p>The secret to doing pure research in the modern era is to hype up the applied aspects for grant-hunting purposes.  Developmental biologists and geneticists don't do ""pure research"": They do ""cancer research"" or ""stem cell research aimed at curing Alzheimers"". Even when someone who hasn't read certain paragraphs of the grant proposal would have a <i>lot</i> of trouble telling the difference. (""Are you sure you're not just having fun trying to make the fruit fly grow new eyes in embarrassing places?"" ""No, I'm studying the regulation of this very important oncogene, implicated in 36% of human cancers, that also happens to make fruit files see out of their feet."" The beauty of it is: None of this is untrue. [1])<p>And a lot of that vice-Provost stuff is for show. Most professors couldn't actually make money in the market if it fell on their head. They're filing patents, collecting letters of collaboration from captains of industry, and talking big about ""entrepreneurship"" because it's cheap talk that impresses funding agencies. (A lot of funding applications have a section for listing such things.)<p>Finally, it's important to remember why there used to be a lot of industry money for ""pure"" research [2]: Monopolies. The public paid for that research via what amounted to a set of not-particularly-progressive sales taxes on phones (Bell Labs), photocopiers (Xerox PARC), and computer equipment (IBM labs). I don't have a study or anything, but it seems to me that soon after each of these big companies started seeing significant market competition, their pure research started to dry up, despite its world-class quality. It may be that pure research can't survive in a competitive market: The only way to sustain it is via tax-supported public funding. Hopefully with more intelligently-designed taxes than, say, a tax on all our phones.<p>---<p>[1] Except that I made this oncogene up. ;) What I'm trying to say is: It's true that understanding cancer requires us to understand apparently unconnected facts about eye development in fruit flies. There's little about growth and development that <i>doesn't</i> have implications for cancer.<p>[2] It's also possible to argue that the industrially-funded ""pure"" research of old wasn't particularly pure. It was all intended to be applied or sold... just on a time scale more suited for a monopoly than a startup. Of course, it turned out that, even given a long-enough time, such a plan often doesn't work: For example, Xerox turned out to be well equipped to <i>prototype</i> the Alto, but was very ill equipped to manufacture and market it. It took a much younger and less mature company to do that.",1234024518

471209,comment,471147,471183,0,0,notsomuch96,,,"Wow!  That was insightful.  Good for you.<p>Yes, this post was prompted by a team member who screwed us over royally, but it's happened enough over the last year to indicate a certain set of principles that are common amongst the people we've worked with.<p>I think it would be interesting to hear how the community balances passion for a project vs. commitment.  For example, I think it's great that you are able to take on only those projects that you really enjoy or have passion for.  But, in my experience, this has been taken way too far.<p>For example, after months of vetting and working together as a team, and much sacrifice made by all team members, we've had programmers pull out on us at crucial periods.  Not because of technology disputes or personal issues or disagreements about money, but simply because they've decided that they're really ""not passionate"" about this particular project.<p>I can understand choosing a project based on enjoyment and passion, but once you a make a commitment, you need to man up and come through with your side of the bargain, especially if everybody else contributes as agreed.  In a business world where nobody lives up to their word, there's going to be an awful lot of chaos.<p>I've seen enough programmers flake out and blame it on ""lack of enjoyment"" to know that this thread is obviously running through the community.<p>Rather than being instilled with a sense of responsibility, independent programmers are encouraged by this community to simply follow their passion and do absolutely nothing that they don't consider ""enjoyable"" at all times.  This approach, in the extreme, is counter productive for our society.  There is no situation where good things happen without some level of sacrifice.<p>In <i>my</i> experience, the coder community has convinced itself that anything hard or structured in any way, is not worth the time.

471206,comment,470798,471185,0,0,jsdalton,,,"Actually (someone can correct me if I'm wrong here), I believe in her situation her payments probably will change.<p>Her main loan was a 5 year, interest only loan, probably at an adjustable rate. What that means is that for the first 5 years, she ONLY paid interest...that is to say, she did not pay down the principal. At the end of the first 5 years, you start paying down the principal and interest, only that's now compressed into 25 years instead of 30. In short, your payments increase.<p>People took these loans out because they assume that in 5 years there house would be worth much more than it was when they bought it (of course, because housing always goes up, right?). So the idea was, in 5 years, when my house is worth a lot more, I can just refinance it.<p>If it sounds foolish now...well truthfully it sounded just as foolish at the time (as I recall when I learned about this stuff back in 2003).

The hard part is overcoming the momentum that CL has or in your case (since you want to go for people in rural areas) figuring out how to get people using it before there's a reason to use it (i.e. other people using it).<p>So, the chances that your site will succeed aren't wonderful.  It's not that it isn't a worthy site, it's that there's a high level of random chance involved in whether a site like this succeeds.

Success for your site will be (mostly) determined by whether other people use it since the majority of the value will be the user contributed content and not your code.<p>But, in terms of the code:<p>* Better search.  CL only matches whole words as far as I can tell and it's just not great.  Do it better.  Get people to what they want more easily.<p>* Logins.  I don't like having to create logins and until you're big don't put that hurdle in front of people.  When your site has a million users, they will see the value of an account.  Right now, an account is another reason not to use your site.  Why should I register for a site with no one on it?  However, if I can just post without registering, well, I might.

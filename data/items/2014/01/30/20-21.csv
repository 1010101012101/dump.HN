I attribute it to a combination of lousy acoustics and a lack of visual cues.  If you talk at the same volume, maybe you just have a better phone or headset than most people.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a matter of eavesdropping; rather, it seems harder to ignore a half-conversation than a full one, because the latter is normal and expected.  Maybe we will eventually become habituated, and in another 10 years we will all be walking around talking to our glasses, watches, or whatever, automatically ignoring each other.",1391115599

The company would include the extra cash payment in the employee-compensation category of its profit-and-loss statements.  The extra cash payment would likewise be tax-deductible for the company (that is unless your salary is over $1 million).",1391115562

It is certainly possible to de-anonymize individuals if you know enough details to get a correlation, but how many people do you know sufficiently well to work backwards through that process? If your goal is to sell more shampoo by working out who has dandruff, for example, the marginal cost of de-anonymizing your potential customers is likely to drastically exceed the marginal benefit of each additional sale. Fishing expeditions by Fleet street or private detectives targeted on a particular individual are likely to either raise red flags if too obvious or be wildly expensive if sufficiently stealthy (multiple pull requests followed by client-side correlation) - cheaper to go the traditional route of bribing the nanny or suchlike.<p>On the other hand, the increased risks of malicious de-anonymization (risk, not certainty) have to be weighed against the obvious benefit of having a portable health record and reducing duplication and administrative overhead if you are taken ill and have to visit a hospital or a doctor who&#x27;s not your GP.",1391115552

Many of the financial stresses of low income are moderated by not conforming to those norms.<p>For example, take this story: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2013/07/18/why-mcdonalds-employee-budget-has-everyone-up-in-arms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2013/07/18/why-mcdonal...</a><p>A major criticism of the McDonald&#x27;s budget is that it only allocates $600 per month for rent.  Ok, well, I&#x27;ll grant you that it&#x27;s hard to find a single-bedroom apartment in most major cities for that little.  <i>However,</i> it is quite easy (I know, because I have done it) to find a <i>two</i> bedroom apartment in a nice, safe neighborhood in Los Angeles (of all places) for about double that.  Living with roommates may not be everyone&#x27;s ideal (some prefer it), but I find it disingenuous to assume that everyone <i>ought</i> be living in some culturally-defined way.  Living with (a) roommate(s) is just one example of a &quot;lifestyle sacrifice&quot; that does not harm your health or safety, and doesn&#x27;t affect your autonomy as a person (much).  But it does significantly reduce living expenses.<p>Another example is car ownership.  Even Los Angeles&#x27; &quot;famously bad&quot; bus network will take you anywhere in the county (and there is Zip Car for when it&#x27;s absolutely necessary to drive).  Resisting social pressure (from friends and potential mates) to own a car reduces living expenses dramatically.

It manifests in this way typically: founder tells company on a Monday that the priority is x; then in middle of the week says priority is y while being oblivious to the fact that y directly contradicts x. This leads to the barrage of water cooler gossip wondering if the founder knows what the heck he is doing.<p>The sad thing is that usually founders have good reasons to constantly reassess priorities especially in early stages.

7153121,comment,7152068,7152985,8,0,nostrademons,,,"The speed difference between querySelectorAll and getElementsBy* is entirely because of the difference between live nodelists and static nodelists.  getElementsBy* returns a nodelist that reflects changes in the DOM in real time - this means that it&#x27;s just returning a pointer.  querySelectorAll copies the full result set into an array-like object at method-call time.<p>The flip side of this is that iterating over a querySelectorAll nodelist is significantly faster than iterating over a getElementsBy* nodelist.  You really don&#x27;t want to call .length on a getElementsBy* nodelist, because it&#x27;s O(N) and has to traverse the full nodelist.  .length on a querySelectorAll nodelist is just a field lookup.  That means that when you combine the original call with one iteration, you&#x27;re usually about breaking even with querySelectorAll.<p>Also, setting CSS properties doesn&#x27;t for a full relayout; it just sets a dirty bit and the property.  Setting CSS properties <i>and then querying the DOM</i> causes a full relayout.  Unfortunately JQuery often does the latter in .css, which makes it slow as molasses.  You can do direct .style manipulations all you want with very little performance penalty though.",1391113460

Unethical marketing is where you serve yourself at the expense of your customer.<p>One problem, of course, is that advertising and marketing people, being what they are, will almost always tell you they are trying to serve the customer. (And they generally believe it.) To tell the good from the bad, you will have to use your own moral compass.<p>The bigger one, though, is that it&#x27;s an arms race. In a perfect world, nobody would push anything. You could just release your new product; those hungry for a solution would find it and become your customers. Sadly, those people right now are being aggressively manipulated by your competitors. They will never hear about your product. If you want to succeed, you will have to get your hands dirty with actual marketing.<p>Personally, I bridge the gap by asking myself three things:<p>1. Are we legitimately creating value for our customers? Would they be better off using our product?<p>2. Is our approach to marketing reasonably ethical, and at least no worse than the competition?<p>3. In the long term, are we acting in ways that will reduce the arms race, or at least make it no worse?",1391113253

He needs to implement new features fast, and does not want to worry about low level stuff. Once he&#x27;s done with a project, he moves on to another.<p>Then, we meet a JS-framework developer, let&#x27;s call her Alice. She has to weight every line of code she writes because her decision can have have a huge impact on thousand of developers using her stuff. She needs to understand a lot of low-level details in order to make good decisions and ship rock solid stuff.<p>Now, both Bob and Alice have to decide whether they need to include jQuery in their projects or not. Heck, they need to justify their decisions to their teams / managers.<p>What&#x27;s Bob going to say? He will start thinking about what will happen if he does not include jQuery to his project. Well, he will have to implement some of the low-level stuff by himself, and later maintain the code. Probably, in a month he&#x27;s going to be working on another project and will have to copy & paste the same stuff over. And if there was a bug? Is he going to update all the previous projects he is not getting paid for anymore? If he&#x27;s smart, he&#x27;s going to say: we&#x27;ll take jQuery, as it provides a nice, stable, robust and battle-hardened API. We&#x27;re going to move faster if we use it, as we don&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel.<p>What about Alice? She will probably have to consider introducing a new dependency to her framework. Is it OK to add those additional hundreds of lines of jQuery code to an already large codebase? Is she going to be able to provide a consistent experience between different (and future) versions of jQuery? Is the core of her application going to rely on an external tool, even if it is rock-solid and lose the potential to make low-level optimizations and have full control? Maybe, she&#x27;s going to say: well, I&#x27;m going to identify the elements that need some of jQuery&#x27;s stuff and implement it by myself. She will be taking the time and effort needed to test it well and be sure that it works across different platforms.<p>At the end of the day, both will have made the right decision, even if in absolute terms they took the exact opposite action.<p>Software engineering is about making decisions, in a given context and moment, for a given purpose. As software engineers, we should not generalize about some of the decisions people have to make. There is no one single truth, it all depends on a variety of variables and factors.

There are three types of workouts you should do within this time. Long Slow Distance (LSD), Continuous High Intensity (CHI), and Interval (INT). For LSD, you run the entire time for a long distance slow enough such that you can talk comfortably the entire time. For CHI, you run 15 minutes at 90-95% of your maximum speed and then recover. For INT, you run for 2.5 minutes at maximum speed followed by 5 minutes of recovery, repeating until done.

Once created the library&#x27;s instance is fully thread safe. Because I only wish to incur the initialization cost once I have a straightforward singleton to wrap the instance:<p><pre><code>  GetInstance():\n    hold mutex\n    if instance is null:\n      instance = ExpensiveLibraryConstructor()\n    return instance\n</code></pre>\nNow the code I&#x27;m writing code plugs into a framework I don&#x27;t control. I create a class that conforms to the framework&#x27;s client interface and the framework creates instances of my class and calls a Run() method. My Run() method needs to be able to make use of the third-party library, so I&#x27;m calling my singleton&#x27;s GetInstance() method there.<p>Not that it would make much practical difference but ExpensiveLibraryConstructor() needs some environment initialization done before it will succeed so I cannot invoke the constructor in global scope.<p>Do you know of a better way?",1391112771

It had sixty-four processors, each as big as an upright piano because it was built before its time. In fact, they had to use a forklift to plug in the units. It took seven or eight years to build, and the machine was obsolete by the time it was finished. The university gave it to NASA, which promised to use it but had difficulty doing so.</i><p><i>That the project was too ambitious, given the available technology, was not what Minsky meant by the ILLIAC IV mistake. He told Hillis that the concept itself was flawed; it was a mistake, he said, to restrict all the sixty-four processors to doing exactly the same thing at the same time, an expanded electronic version of the Olympic event synchronized swimming. Minsky told Hillis that the processors should be able to operate independently.</i><p><i>&quot;About a month later,&quot; Minsky recalls, &quot;Danny came back to me and said, &#x27;Well, I&#x27;ve decided to make the ILLIAC IV mistake.&#x27;&quot; Hillis told Minsky that the problem was not in what the processors did but in how they communicated. He said that intraprocessor signals got stuck in traffic jams because, among other things, the connecting wires were restricted to two dimensions. Hillis recognized that a richer connection scheme was required, all the more so since he wanted to hook up not 64 processors but 65,536. The signal traffic would be equivalent to a telephone network serving 65,536 customers who placed a quarter of a billion calls per second. That was the chief technical problem Hillis faced in designing the Connection Machine.</i><p><i>In the end, Hillis and his co-workers at Thinking Machines settled on a three-dimensional architecture in which the processors were connected as if they formed a sixteen-dimensional cube. What this means is that each processor, although directly connected to only 16 others, was never more than sixteen steps away from any of the other 65,536 processors. Moreover, the possibility of a traffic jam was reduced because in sixteen dimensions there are numerous possible routes between any two processors.</i> [1]<p>[1] From the book <i>Archimedes&#x27; Revenge: The Joys and Perils of Mathematics</i> by Paul Hoffman (New York: Ballantine Books, 1988), pp. 203--4.",1391112648

Cleary, ExtJS seemed to suit my fancy more than the other libraries in the JS world.<p>As far as why it doesn&#x27;t have traction, I would attribute this to 2 things.  The first being that the JS community isn&#x27;t really into app development.  What I mean by that, is when you look at JS, and you look at languages like Flex and Silverlight, you notice a massive disconnect in ideas.  In the JS world, visual components are rarely if ever first class citizens, simple layout tasks are far more difficult than they need to be, and SPA paradigms are also second class citizens.  After noticing this and poking around, you find out that the main JS community either doesn&#x27;t want the solution to begin with, or they seem to be re-inventing the wheel.<p>The second strike against ExtJS is the cost.  I got a license for it a few years ago when I was delusional and thought I could use it to replace Flex.  Dropping $1,000 on something when virtually every other tech out there is free is hard to choke down.<p>Also, it seemed like a major step down for those of us coming from the Flex community.  Like I said, with JS app paradigms seem like afterthoughts and each peculiarity wore me down further and further.  For instance, if you have a button and you declare a listener function but misspell it, you don&#x27;t get an error complaining that the listener doesn&#x27;t exist, you get a blank white screen.  Another issue was marshalling data into objects.  Whenever I brought back a Classroom JSON representation, the Student objects in the students collection remained unmarshalled.  I had to use ANOTHER store to get those to behave as objects.  All of these &quot;why on earth is this acceptable&quot; moments led me to believe such features weren&#x27;t really in demand in the JS community if not resented altogether.",1391112532

I&#x27;m looking at the jQuery API modules now and here&#x27;s what I consider jQuery is still useful (as in nontrivial to replicate):<p><pre><code>  - AJAX (Too many cross-browser differences in XHR/XDR implementations)\n  - Event delegation (Too many cross-browser differences in what gets triggered/bubble/cancelable)\n</code></pre>\nMost things in jQuery may only save you a couple of keystrokes to a few lines of code. For everything else, you can drop in a small library / polyfill when needed to get back something like $.Deferred or the $.fn.serialize() or $.fn.val(). In fact, there are already many small libraries that aim to do just one thing only and do it well.<p>3) You never need all of jQuery. If you need all of jQuery, you are doing it wrong. I don&#x27;t even want to look at your giant pile of procedural, chained-20-times-for-every-element hourglass-shaped callback pasta.<p>4) The plugin ecosystem is horrible. This might have to do with the fact that jQuery doesn&#x27;t give you any help other than a namespace. Most plugins come with ginormous pile of options and/or very rigid and opaque  HTML/CSS structures. Most of them don&#x27;t come with tests, are extremely buggy and very very hard to tweak.<p>5) jQuery is extremely slow. Its slowest parts are creating the context because of Sizzle and event delegation. My recent PR for Backbone to make jQuery optional in its View is around 70% faster using all native DOM methods.<p>6) jQuery was born in 2006, when IE6 still had 70% of market share. jQuery&#x27;s many layers of smooth-overs come at a very high performance cost, and it doesn&#x27;t even smooth things over that well. There are still many edge cases in event handling such as triggering a click that bubbles on a detached element on Webkit that jQuery just <i>can&#x27;t</i> do for you. Shouldn&#x27;t you aim to provide the best experience for the 50-80% of users out there who are on modern browsers instead of a mediocre experience for 100% of them?",1391112488

Even from disk cache each KB increases startuptime by about 1ms (and jquery 2 is ~32kb minified, for < 2.0 lot more). Over cellular connection you can nicely multiply each KB by 100ms. This is even worse when you minify and concat your JS library dependencies, as most likely your cache headers expire way too fast for them. If you have bothered to set them at all.<p>Also, last time I checked jquery uses &quot;querySelectorAll&quot; for that fancy $(&quot;selector&quot;) syntax, which is slow as hell with every possible browser compared to &quot;getElementBy*&quot;. This might not be issue with desktop machines, but you will probably lose most of your mobile users because of that. Jquery does also exposes very dangearous things from the API.

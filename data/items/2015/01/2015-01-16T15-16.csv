8899670,comment,8896221,8897086,0,0,RogerL,,,"Ya, my comment was too brief. I was mostly reacting to the HN posters that basically were saying &quot;Microsoft evil&quot; by gently pointing out that other companies are leaving bugs in for longer than Microsoft. For example, someone posted &quot;Other companies fix such bugs in days.&quot; Well, there are counterexamples, aren&#x27;t there (OS X at the moment).<p>I think what Microsoft is doing is really hard. I don&#x27;t have insight into their process, having never worked there. So yes, we can <i>speculate</i> that they could do things much faster. But can they? I find it rather tasteless to just assume so with no evidence and to then go on and call them names.  I dunno, maybe they are falling flat on their faces internally, or maybe the team is performing heroics at the cost of personal lives, or maybe it is just business as usual.<p>But, it was also an honest question. Maybe there <i>is</i> evidence out there that Microsoft is just failing, and I haven&#x27;t seen it or my reading comprehension failed me and I saw it but didn&#x27;t register it.<p>But mostly, I am tired of the hurl accusations and drag people&companies through the mud meme that happens here, and this seemed to be more of the same (again, open to evidence, not claims, to the contrary).",1421423983
8899669,comment,8898088,8898088,0,0,talmand,,,"As a father of daughters, I&#x27;m waiting for the series of articles that will help me understand the proper way to have a conversation with them about the fact that their boyfriends, when they are old enough to have them, do not have the muscular build nor the attractive looks of common comic book characters such as Batman, Superman, and so on that they constantly see. Never mind when they see movies with all those overly attractive male stars.<p>But all I get are articles about how certain comic books, that they probably shouldn&#x27;t be reading anyway, gives them unrealistic expectations of what their bodies should look like. Plus the fact that will somehow prevent them from getting a career they want to have.<p>Anyway, I often take my daughters to the local comic book store that I feel has an adequate range of comics for all ages and gender. I let them loose to get what they want. The older one goes for things like Monster High and My Little Pony. The younger goes for those as well as TMNT and Transformers. I just let them decide for themselves what kind of comic book reader they want to be. I feel they&#x27;ll mostly work it out for themselves. Some people shouldn&#x27;t worry so much over such details because in the end it only stifles your kid&#x27;s growth as a person.

This is about Northern Ireland, which had an undeclared low simmering civil war for much of the late 20th century, with abuses by state powers (imprisonment without trail, soliders shooting protesters on the streets), active paramilitary groups killing civilians and state actors, and undemocratic processes (gerrymandering of votes).<p>I think we know what happens when the UK/NI state wants to abuse one part of the population.",1421423953

8899662,comment,8898941,8899593,0,0,soneca,,,"Because it is more complicated than this. One point is where is the causation in this correlation (calories vs weight). Everyone who doesn&#x27;t want to think a lot about it think that your consuming of too much calories makes you gain weight. But evidence is that you having too much weight demands you to consume more calories - and it is very difficult to escape all the tricks your brain and body have to make you do what they want. The same happens when you burn calories, your body demands you to consume more calories.<p>So how to loose weight if your overweight or overexhausted body will keep demanding you to eat excessive calories? The trick is to consume different kinds of calories, and this is where consuming less carb and more fat enters.<p>A good analysis I heard here in HN once (sorry, don&#x27;t remember the author) is that just saying is calories in vs calories burn is like explaining why a Super Bowl stadium is full of people saying: &quot;Because more people got in than went out&quot;. It is not an useful analysis, it is not actionable and it shows that you know nothing about the dynamics of this particular phenomen.",1421423892
8899661,comment,8898088,8898525,0,0,bane,,,"Many of the non-superhero comic books in the U.S. end up being adult themed for various reasons. Even many notable French artists are only known here for their work in magazines like Heavy Metal.<p>One I grew up with (that I probably shouldn&#x27;t have had as a child) was the Conan the Barbarian comics. Definitely not a superhero title, and definitely skewed towards the adult demographic.<p>Asterix has tried to penetrate the U.S. market several times, but the style says &quot;newspaper comic strip&quot; to Americans and that&#x27;s where it got stuck.<p>Prince Valiant is also an American comic, shown mostly in newspapers.<p>Spirou et Fantasio looks excellent, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s ever been a concerted effort to translate the title into English.<p>Same with Gaston.<p>I personally think there&#x27;s a deep well of wonderful French comics that have yet to really make it into the American market: Val√©rian and Laureline, Blueberry, Arzach, etc. Where the artwork and writing are wonderful. But then again, I think Arzach and other Moebius works ended up here under the Heavy Metal books, which <i>are</i> widely known among late-teen early adult readers.",1421423876

Those numbers are just the work forces of the companies involved in the lawsuit.<p>But the class is defined as just the employees of these companies from 2005-09. This has two implications: 1) the proof issue is much easier--you don&#x27;t have to get into a calculation of economic damages for the sector as a whole; 2) the settlement release theoretically doesn&#x27;t preclude people who weren&#x27;t employees of these companies from bringing a different lawsuit based on the indirect injury.<p>Don&#x27;t underestimate the significance of (1). You&#x27;re talking about a battle of economic expert witnesses, where your burden will be to prove that the defendants&#x27; conduct actually suppressed salaries during a time period when engineering salaries were skyrocketing. Whether or not that theory of the case is true, I don&#x27;t know if its winnable.<p>Also, using 64,000 employees as the denominator is a bit misleading. Some people might have gotten a lot more money over the time period by taking an offer that was prohibited by a no-poaching agreement. But other members of the class may not have gotten those calls anyway, and so weren&#x27;t harmed.<p>EDIT: &#x27;gojomo and &#x27;harryh hit the nail on the head.

8899635,comment,8894902,8895644,0,0,xorcist,,,"I thought I was perfectly clear in which points were not yours. My point with including the whole list of standard arguments against DNSSEC, not only yours, was that they are well known to DNS implementors for over ten years.<p>1. Since you decide that the whole of DNS is &quot;government controlled&quot; (which is a statement of a kind that are useless to discuss furhter), you must also accept that &quot;a race to the bottom in CA pricing&quot; means certficates generated without human intervention. That would mean a very complex and error prone to implement the same security model as DANE gives you, where domain ownership is cryptographically assured.<p>2. That is only because &quot;government controlled&quot; is a meaningless phrase. ICANN is not more government controlled than any other organization operating in a jurisdiction. They have a mandate from the US Department of Commerce but that does not mean they are &quot;controlled&quot; by them. It could certainly improve, but the proposals for a multi stakeholder model has so far been thinly veiled attemts to politicize ICANN. That does not mean it can not be done. The fact that they root zone has a spotless record of political meddling so far should count for something.<p>3. This last statement is incorrect. DNSSEC is not RSA-1024 for the forseeable future. Implementating an alternative way to secure DNS with more modern cryptography is many orders of magnitude more difficult than switching algorithms in DNSSEC, which is completely supported.<p>4. Again a statement so general it holds true for implementing any world wide standard. If you want every software under the sun to handle lookup failures correctly, that is expensive in itself. Is DNSSEC more expensive than any reasonable alternative? No, probably less so. Failure modes are well understood.<p>Since the rest of the points weren&#x27;t raised by you directly (but then again, many times by others) I think we can concede them from any further discussion.",1421423697

In Norway, the vast majority of rooms that you can rent from the semi-public student welfare organizations are roughly 7-13 m^2.

If you decide to rent a private room or apartment, you will probably get a few more square metres, but will run the risk of an asshole landlord who might steal your deposit, living with people who are not studying and have no plans to do so, and if you&#x27;re slightly unfortunate there might be mold in your bedroom and/or bathroom as well.

A graph can be trivially modelled relationally as a &quot;vertex&quot; table and an &quot;edge&quot; table. A particular problem I have with the graph model is that edges cannot be referenced by other entries in the database; thus the schema designer must prefer using vertices to model all concepts, in case future data has to make reference to it.<p>The &quot;graph model&quot; was, in the 60s and 70s, called the &quot;network model&quot; [1]. This is the environment in which Codd introduced the relational model [2], where he wrote:<p>> In previous work there has been a strong tendency to treat the data in a data bank as consisting of two parts, one part consisting of entity descriptions (for example, descriptions of suppliers) and the other part consisting of relations between the various entities or types of entities (for example, the supply relation). This distinction is difficult to maintain when one may have foreign keys in any relation whatsoever. In the user‚Äôs relational model there appears to be no advantage to making such a distinction (there may be some advantage, however, when one applies relational concepts to machine representations of the user‚Äôs set of relationships).<p>It&#x27;s quite funny that after the elegance of Codd&#x27;s work, we&#x27;re thinking about going back to the network model and all its problems. If we&#x27;re going to consider that, we need <i>very</i> good reasons, but I haven&#x27;t seen any.<p>I do see some features of Cypher as nice compared to SQL. Specifically those features that implement graph algorithms (e.g. shortest path). I do think there is space in the relational world for languages other than SQL. For example, it is disappointing that no relational databases implement Datalog as a query language. However, it is important not to conflate &quot;SQL&quot; and &quot;the relational model&quot;.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_model</a>

A long time ago there used to be quite a number of comics that targeted young kids, girls and people other than the 11-15 year old male demographic. There&#x27;s also been lots of effort put into making games that will appeal to people outside of that demographic.<p>You could say, numbers don&#x27;t lie, that those titles weren&#x27;t being sold in enough quantities to keep them alive...and in some sense that&#x27;s true. But how many ultra-niche comics with bizarre indie storylines stay alive year after year?<p>Actually a very large number of women I know ended up just reading Manga, they managed to find storylines and characterizations that they enjoyed. And now those women are watching cartoons, movies and dramas based on those same Manga. Most comic book stores you go into have a Manga section these days. But Manga is also full of titles with lots of sexualization. Like anything you have to be a smart consumer and not write off an entire class of entertainment, like movies, just because adult film stores exist.<p>It&#x27;s the same with video games, after decades of struggle to find the market, some surveys are showing that women make up a significant portion of computer-game players: with leading games like The Sims, Bejeweled and WoW having huge populations of women playing them.<p>So the market is there, it&#x27;s just that the makers are not doing a good enough job of hitting that market. Console game makers are just now starting to learn from computer game makers, and we&#x27;re starting to see decent titles (mostly PC ports) to woo the other 50% of the market. But they too have really put out some crap trying to find that market.<p>But here&#x27;s the truth, the women in mainstream super hero comic books are barely anatomically correct, but so are the men. Average characters possess exaggerated musculature not even the Greek gods possessed. And everybody has fantastical powers. These aren&#x27;t meant to be forms of entertainment that represent reality...even a little bit.

The thing that most of them had in common was that they weren&#x27;t emotionally bound to the outcome. They didn&#x27;t care if the person said yes or no - except for the endorphin kick they got when they saw their pay cheque get bigger. For most of them, it was a game they played against each other - in the same way you might enjoy a board game and you strive to win, but the real fun is the camaraderie of the players.<p>A rejection got a shoulder shrug and a &quot;whatever, next&quot; or a few choice curse words and the finger when the sales person wasted more time than necessary for a sale that never came before quickly moving on to the next call - the previous call forgotten as quickly as the next, unless the conversation was particularly humorous or worth sharing with their compatriots.<p>Those with no scruples learned to manipulate people really well and got the sales by whatever means necessary. Those that cared got sales by listening to the customer and understanding the customer&#x27;s needs. Mostly though, almost without exception, those with the most sales were those that got through the highest volume phone calls in a day. The success rate could be skewed to have a higher ratio of sales to calls, but at the end of the day, that took emotional effort and didn&#x27;t really yield any extra benefit to the sales person - of course, this potentially had a huge negative affect on the reputation of the company. I see the same thing with all the utility companies. Their sales teams are often the first point of contact for a customer. But the sales guys don&#x27;t care about that, all they care about are the numbers. The rest is for customer service to figure out.<p>The lesson I learned from watching the sales guys in action is that all things considered equal, the greater the volume of calls, the greater your success. Don&#x27;t be emotionally involved in the outcome before it&#x27;s necessary to do so - at the end of the day, you&#x27;re just asking her to come for coffee with you, you&#x27;re not asking her to marry you. The more people you ask to go for coffee, the more chance you&#x27;ll find someone that&#x27;s got nothing better to do than go for coffee with you - even if you do think they&#x27;re out of your league (that&#x27;s another concept I don&#x27;t believe in, but that&#x27;s for another day and another post).",1421421701

There are also stories of people who got &#x27;caught&#x27;, in that the immigration officials decided they&#x27;d done too many runs and couldn&#x27;t explain how they were living in HK without working, and were given 2 weeks to clear up and move out. It&#x27;s a risk...<p>With a UK passport you&#x27;d get 180 days of visa-free stay per entry, with most other &#x27;developed-world&#x27; passports you&#x27;d get 90 days. The actual rules on what you can do during that stay are quite strict - attending meetings, negotiating/signing contracts, etc. is allowed, but most other work isn&#x27;t - to the extent that technically you&#x27;re not even allowed to do voluntary work. That said, nobody is going to bother you if you&#x27;re here for a few months and happen to be working for a remote client/employer at home or in a coffee shop. It&#x27;s the visa runs which are the danger, since that&#x27;s when they can pick you up. May not be a nice thing to say, but being white does help quite a lot.<p>It&#x27;s easier to be here as a resident, legally. You get (almost-)free access to government healthcare, and things like banking are much easier, plus of course you don&#x27;t have that looking-over-your-shoulder feeling.<p>One standard piece of advice, which definitely doesn&#x27;t fit everyone but might be worth considering - assuming you and the GF are a heterosexual couple, a civil marriage is relatively simple in HK, and assuming she is working and/or a resident in her own right, that would get you a visa as a dependent. HK doesn&#x27;t recognise non-heterosexual relationships in any useful way...<p>An alternative might be Taiwan, maybe not for you, but for others seeking &#x27;Asia&#x27; - I do know a Brit who&#x27;s been living there for years doing visa runs while writing code for people mostly in the UK, and it seems to work for him and his drunken bum lifestyle :)",1421421516

Graph databases seem to be marketed as an ideal way to represent a social network or similar where you want to represent the connections with other entities.<p>I see them as much more than this. I love using document databases because I don&#x27;t have to worry about strict schemas. However, I lose a lot when I have multiple entities that are related in some way. Say I have a list of books and a list of authors. In MongoDB the book object would just have an id of the author and would then need to do a separate query to get the authors details.<p>Before graph databases, this sort of data would be best represented in a relational database as they have a really efficient way to join related data together.<p>However, with graph databases I get the best - and even better - of both of these worlds. My book entity contains a pointer to the author(s), so to query the book and their authors is even faster than a relational database.<p>In addition there is no fixed schema, so I am not tied down to a strict schema, thus allowing me to iterate faster. This could of course also be seen as a disadvantage - however I see no reason why a graph database couldn&#x27;t build in the facility to have strong validation on the schema for specific entity types..<p>What is there not to like about Neo4J?",1421420864

It was built with the ability to run in batch mode. Like Unix, it was built on a set of single purpose tools. These tools formed the API and the user interacted directly with it in the form of commands.<p>The graphic display was a side-effect. Events on the graphic display were mapped back to the API, i.e. mapped back to commands. The reason, most likely, is that in the days of MSDOS AutoDesk had to write hardware drivers themselves or convince third party hardware vendors write them. Having a developer friendly architecture helped in both cases.<p>Post-Macintosh programs such as PhotoShop went down a different architectural path. There was a pre-existing graphics subsystem and no obvious interest in developing up from the terminal. So these applications were developed down from the GUI. In the days of 256k RAM and 10meg disks, there was a lot of need for expediency and GUI code and application code often mixed. The result was a lack of an AutoCad style API.<p>If a procedure looks at screen layout directly, how do you turn it into a command from the keyboard with sensible parameters? Such a refactoring is hard, messy, and not at on the feature list marketing has developed. Lets face it, the PhotoShop user community would not just reject a command based interface, it might express outrage.<p>Going one step further, in the early 1990&#x27;s AutoDesk massively refactored AutoCad&#x27;s code. They took the hit in the form of R13. Then they started adding incredible features with each version again for the next twenty years.",1421420781

In some cases, though, I don&#x27;t think its so much that the industries are really finding adoption in a larger market, its that people with ideological axes to grind who aren&#x27;t part of the market are coming to those industries and beating on them for not even trying to find a broader market but instead doing what they&#x27;ve done for a long time to focus on a market that is well-proven.",1421420543

Those numbers are just the work forces of the companies involved in the lawsuit.<p>The entire greater Bay area technology job sector, one of the highest paid jobs in America, in the region of its highest concentration, was artificially depressed. These companies put a ceiling on what a given job was worth. If you work in Silicon valley in technology, you were effected. The ability to moved to another company and get paid what you are worth was effected.<p>The shear scope and damage these companies did is almost beyond belief. We are not talking hundreds of millions of dollars. We are talking Billions and Billions.<p>The ripple effects are even crazier. How many new technology companies did not get created because people&#x27;s depressed salaries reduced how much they could save to bootstrap something new? How much did technology workers not spend into the service industry or the larger economy, because they were underpaid?<p>This is a staggeringly insidious act with wide reaching repercussions beyond Adobe poaching some PhDs from Google, or vice versa.",1421420540

While agreed that it is definitely not a license to eat however much you want, there are some convincing arguments that eating in this pattern (particularly delaying carbohydrate intake until the evening hours) creates metabolic inefficiencies that cause more of the consumed energy from the diet to be &quot;wasted&quot;, perhaps giving a person a couple hundred calories of leeway in their diet and still see effective weight control.  Check out some the work of John Keifer, his opinion on this is fascinating, particularly his rants on his podcast: <a href=""http://body.io/category/podcast/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://body.io/category/podcast/</a>",1421420534

We just proxy a domain path through to port 5280 on the ejabberd server and it works like a champ.<p>Http-bind has been working better this year.

940527,comment,940188,940188,0,0,zachware,,,"This wasn't an interview, it was a test. I had a similar experience with a startup. I was interviewing for a Marketing Communications Manager position. Essentially PR.<p>One of the unofficial interviewers (at 24 year old MIT engineer working as an email marketer) challenged me with the question ""How many barbers are in San Francisco?"" We proceeded to map it out the analytical process on the whiteboard. He wanted to see formulas to understand how I would arrive at the answer.<p>It was a stupid, impossible question. In a similar way to this girl's experience, he jabbed repeatedly critiquing my logic.<p>He wrote me later to explain that he posed the same question to his girlfriend, an MIT engineer herself, and she couldn't come up with an answer. Neither could he.<p>They offered me the job and I declined solely based on this guy and his misguided, silly behavior. I would have hated to work with him.<p>When a company misguidedly challenges potential employees in this way it hurts the quality of its hires. Sure, Google can afford to be picky but does it really need an engineer in a Product Marketing role? Perhaps for dev-facing apps but such an interview process is overall misguided and immature.",1258138742

</code></pre>
In my previous job I conducted a lot of interviews of an analytical style. Some people bombed so badly that is was clear well before the end that they wouldn't make the next round. In those cases, I used the remaining time to either talk to them about the career hopes/goals, or to explain how they could have better approached the problem (these skills are partly learnt..) to help prepare them for their next interview. The way I saw it was that they were expecting 30 mins of my time, so they would get it, even if they weren't up to the job. It a courtesy, and it's also self interest - burnt interviewees make a lot of noise on campus.<p>When I was 'senior' I never applied to McKinsey, because I'd heard so many horror stories about their interviews - I just didn't want to go anywhere near them.

940513,comment,940133,940481,0,0,NathanKP,,,"I personally think more as Steinbeck in ""The Grapes of Wrath"".  The people in the organization are not evil, it is the organization itself which forces them to play certain roles to serve the group and the machine they have built.<p>Steinbeck portrayed the bank as a great machine in which each person working for it played a small role that they didn't necessarily like to play.  Agents were forced to evict people from their land because they were not able to pay their mortgage, yet that was not something that they really wanted to do.  It was something they had to do because of the corporation they were a part of.<p>No individual person in the corporation is evil (generally).  However the corporation is bigger than each individual member.<p>So calling a corporation evil does not mean branding each individual person.  Rather it means that you recognize that the corporation as a greater force causes evil things.<p>In that respect I don't see it as unrealistic to say then that the corporation can be evil.",1258138098

940502,comment,940043,940448,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"I agree with your assessment and share it myself. What gets me is the ""I'll keep an open mind"" type of comments I see attached to criticism of the language.<p>I don't mean that as a dig against you personally, but what I mean is that a lot of people who admit they don't like the language still feel obligated to add a similar phrase to their statements - which I think is entirely because this came out of Google and has a couple classic rockstars behind it. If it were introduced by an unknown research student or hobbyist, it'd have been dismissed and declared dead from the very start and that'd have been the end of it.<p>(I admit that I also was influenced by this. I saw the initial specs, some examples, and immediately thought, ""this seems... pointless."" But I dug in deeper because of the reputations involved. My opinion hasn't really changed, but I gave it a lot more attention than I would have otherwise because of these factors.)<p>The reason this bugs me is that there's a lot of interesting research out there in the languages world. It shows up on HN pretty frequently, but it never really spills beyond places like here because people have no trouble dismissing or ignoring new ideas immediately when they come from ""strangers."" I guess I don't have a big point here, just that it's unfortunate that this is likely going to result in a huge uptake of Go when other viable systems language alternatives have existed for, in some cases, decades but seem doomed to be ignored just because there wasn't a big name attached.",1258137741

940493,comment,940385,940385,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I reviewed before, and I'm afraid I can't say much different now. My review before was that I thought the profiles were not at all compelling, so I signed in with the business account to see if I could do better. I can't. There isn't enough flexibility, and there's way too much focus on stuff no one cares about. I said it before, and I'll say it again: <i>No one cares what your address is, what your primary, second, and third industries are, or what your office hours are. Most people don't care what your phone number is either since this is a website and they probably expect to use the web to contact a business on it.</i><p>There are also quite a few design issues. Sometimes bold blue text is clickable, sometimes it isn't. Something things listed in the left column are clickable menus, sometimes they aren't. I find it all very confusing. I thought for sure on the home page, I'd be able to click on ""Find what you need"" to go to some sort of search page, but I can't. The search box at the top gives no clue of what you should search for, and if you search for something that gets no results (or results you don't like), there's no indication of what you should do to improve your results. If search isn't your thing, oh well. There's no way to <i>browse</i> on the site, only search. In my opinion, the ability to search without the ability to browse works for exactly one website, and I think you know which one that is.<p>You mention plumbers as an example, but until you reach a <i>huge</i> critical mass, searching for a plumber on your site will not be practical. Craigslist is one of the only websites in the world where it's practical to search for local businesses, and Craigslist is <i>huge</i>. You are tiny. It is not practical to search for a local business that only lists 10 businesses in your entire country. What are the chances of actually finding one? One in a billion? Worse?<p>I think you would do much better to focus on business that don't have a ""service area"" (conveniently eliminating even more from the site that no one cares about). Freelance tech people would be a good target audience as far as businesses go. Software companies are also good. And then you need to give people a chance to actually show themselves on their profiles rather than a bunch of information that, I want to reiterate again, no one cares about. For comparison, this is what a good profile for a designer looks like:<p><a href=""http://www.ganato.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ganato.com/index.php</a><p>It is simply not possible to make something that compelling on your site. On your site, it would look like:<p><pre><code>    Location: Santiago, Chile  
    Service area: Worldwide  
    Name: Lidia Gana  
    Primary industry: Web design  
    Secondary industry: Interface design
</code></pre>
Then there would be a comment area that contains a few good testimonials, perhaps the only thing compelling that could be worked into the profile, a list of business contacts that no one would care about, a discussion board that would not have a enough critical mass for anyone to care about, and a fans section that no one would care about.<p>Finally, there would be one single solitary chance for the designer to show what she can do: the video, but given that the attention span of users is very short and that there was nothing in the profile to compel them to care, many probably won't bother watching the video, especially if it's longer than say, 30 seconds. With 30 seconds, the designer could show only a ridiculously tiny portion of what's on her website. She certainly wouldn't have a whole page that exudes her design skill. She certainly wouldn't have a section where she gives away free stuff to show off her talent.<p>Think of it like this: eHarmony commercials complain that other dating sites give you just a picture and a paragraph and how useless that is. <i>Your website gives businesses and customers just a picture and a paragraph.</i>",1258137496

Some think that all of the wealthy are Donald Trump, but some are Gates and Buffet and Rockefeller and Carnegie.  It does not seem to me that intelligence is always spent so wisely.  There are investors like Stephen Hawking, philanthropists like Norman Borlaug, and then there are people like William J. Sidis.  Wealth squandered or consumed is extremely visible, but I think many capable inventors and entepreneurs stay in grad school and go on to quiet careers--using their brilliance a nothing more than a ticket to a slightly easier life.  The equivalent of quietly living off an inheritance.<p>Your gifts belong to you.  Spent or given back or squandered, they are yours to do with what you will.

If I choose to enrich friends and family who I love, that is up to me--and is one of the main points of having money in the first place.

One minute it's handling smoothly, but then all of a sudden it starts drifting on the ice; the driver attempts to reacquire control but without success. The car spins out of control and lodges into a snowbank (thankfully everyone inside unhurt).<p>Our intuition says this is a catastrophe (perhaps a small catastrophe, but a catastrophe nonetheless): one minute everything was as normal, but then something terrible happened.<p>A catastrophe theorist would agree -- a catastrophe <i>did</i> just occur -- but here the caveat comes into play: a mathematician's catastrophe <i>isn't</i> the horrible crash into the snowbank. Instead, the mathematician's catastrophe is the loss-of-control, as in the moment during which the car transitioned from still-steerable to uncontrollably-drifting.<p>Catastrophe theory is, loosely speaking, the attempt to characterize and understand the fine structure of transitions between different states-of-operation (like the transition from steerable to drifting).<p>Thankfully not all ""catastrophes"" are catastrophes in the casual sense of the word. To provide a sense of the flavor of catastrophe I've prepared a much happier example of ""catastrophe"" involving racing boats (no crashes, I promise!) and as a bonus you'll also learn quite a bit about what makes boats fast or slow.<p>...then in the conclusion reiterate that the transition between the planing mode and the ""normal"" mode is the catastrophe (it's the road, not the destination, that matters).<p>===<p>Be careful with the use of ""we"".<p>It's good b/c it makes it friendly + inclusive but it makes things very jarring when of a sudden you drop to a 3rd person neutral point of view (eg: ""Our truck is now a sports car."" is more coherent with your overall turn than ""The truck is now a sports car."").<p>===<p>Then the idea of planing arose. When planing a boat is no longer displacing water, it's skipping over the top. Some of its ""lift"" comes from the dynamic force of the water hitting the bottom of the hull, and so less water has to be forced out of the way. Less pushing, less bow wave, more speed.<p>...is clunky. You introduce the concept (planing) before you define it. When in the next sentence you do define ""planing"" you do so indirectly: does ""planing"" <i>mean</i> ""a planing boat is skipping over the top of the water, instead of sitting amidst the water"" or is ""planing"" some as-yet unspecified thing that has as a side effect the property that when a boat is planing it's skipping over the water?<p>Not enough time to try rewriting this for you but consider defining-and-motivating planing first -- ""If we could get out of the water somehow we could go faster"" (but more accurate and better-phrased) -- and then introducing the term ""planing"" second (We can, and call this ""planing"", but again better-phrased).<p>===<p>But let's ask the reverse (actually ""converse"") question.

73771,comment,73221,73309,0,0,Goladus,,,"Other measures of brevity:<p>The original ruby definition is 15 tokens, the .to_proc version is 13 tokens.<p>Orthogonality:<p>to_proc<p><p><p><p><p><pre><code>        3 variables (foo, n, x)\n        1 method call (to_proc)\n        1 type of separator (')\n        2 assignment ops (=, +=)\n        2 binary operators (->, .)\n\n        9 different kinds of tokens, in 5 (arbitrary) categories.\n\n        Original:\n        \n        3 keywords (def, lambda, end)\n        3 variables (foo, n, i)\n        5 Separators (|, {, }, (, ))\n        1 assignment (+=)\n\n        12 different kinds of tokens, in 4 categories.\n</code></pre>\nSo the only way the original ruby version comes out ahead by these measures is that it has ""fewer categories"" of token types that are required.  Also I think that with the 'def foo' declaration, 'foo' is not technically a variable.  I don't really know ruby well enough.  But you get the idea.",1193666122

(i.e. Google Enterprise Search) Do you have valuable information that hedge funds or someone else might want to buy? (some of the specialized social networks do this.) Or anything else you can think of... definitely more work than putting up ads, but it could be where the real money is.",1193664635

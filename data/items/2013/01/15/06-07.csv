Don't say things you wouldn't say in a face to face conversation.<p>I often don't realize how my words negatively affect others, until someone says something that affects me. Its not that I don't KNOW it, its just that I am not always consciously aware of it. So I think it helps to get a reminder once in a while.<p>I sometimes go back to reading some of my old online conversations from 12-14 years ago. I always cringe at my writing, English not being my first language. Its still far from perfect, but its a lot better. One of the things that pushed me to better my writing was being berated and made fun of on online forums. But it also led me to a paranoid period where I was genuinely scared of writing any comments or joining a conversation. I would spend 30-60 minutes writing something and then not post it simply because how people might react. I always presume the worst, based on my experience.<p>Don't get me wrong, HN is a thousand times better than many of the other places online. But it could be better and certainly doesn't hurt to be reminded.",1358233181

5059072,comment,5058703,5058910,4,0,csense,,,"My guess as to the logical basis for plea bargaining is the notion that there's two types of criminals.<p>Type A criminals see nothing wrong with hurting others through criminal actions, and will not hesitate to do so if they believe it will get them material benefits and/or thrills (and think they can get away with it).  They have no conscience or restraint.  They are a danger to society and should go away as long as possible.  Think of someone who kills a family member to collect life insurance money.<p>Type B criminals are basically ordinary people who are careless, make a bad decision, aren't aware that a certain action is illegal, or perhaps are consumed by emotional passion.  They genuinely regret their actions and the consequences thereof.  Think of a drunk driver who accidentally kills a pedestrian.<p>The theory behind the guilty/not-guilty plea is that Type A criminals will never confess, since they have no conscience or remorse.  But Type B criminals will want to try to become a good person again, and the first step to this is admitting their past mistakes.<p>That's the theory.  It doesn't always match reality.  For example, the Type B criminal may be so troubled about what he's wrought that he blurts out a confession before getting a plea agreement in writing, in which case the state can still throw the book at him.  Or an innocent person might confess as purely a risk mitigation measure:  If you were some alternate universe's Aaron Swartz, you decided not to commit suicide, and you had a choice between pleading and getting guaranteed 6 months, or having a trial and a 50% chance of a not-guilty verdict but a 50% chance of 35 years in prison, you might be very tempted to choose the former.<p>Interesting mental exercise:  I arbitrarily set the odds of winning a trial at 50-50.

You might as well ask why there's a bunch of law specifically regarding real estate when we already have laws about property, or why the laws about murder are so complex when the basic idea is 'thou shalt not kill.'<p>As an analogy, consider the standard definition of burglary: 'Entry into a building illegally with intent to commit a crime.' Now legally, that means 4 or arguably 5 <i>elements</i> - entry, a building, illegality, intent, and a contemplated crime. These might seem like hair-splitting points, but they're important - not just for the immediate situation of whether someone is guilty or not guilty, but whether or not that makes them liable under a three-strikes law, perhaps years later, or deportable, or how it might affect their sentencing for a completely unrelated crime a decade later, or....<p>...I mean, have you looked laws on fraud? they're complicated! It's not obvious in many real-world situations, and it's even less obvious where computers are concerned. If I am operating a computer system, how much information do I have to give you as a user about what you are or are not allowed to do on my system? Where does my responsibility end and yours begin? I mean, many people can't even understand the distinction between copyright infringement and theft, and fraud is a lot more complicated than simple theft - and theft itself is more complex than most people realize. Lots and lots of legal situations arise because people have different opinions about what sort of behavior is acceptable.<p>I don't know if you remember a pre-internet work environment, but when I was going about in the early 90s promoting the use of email and FTP to skeptical corporate buyers, one of the most frequent questions I used to hear was 'who owns the internet?'

Years of research have demonstrated that founding teams help success. A lone founder can certainly succeed, but is less likely to do so.<p>Premise 3, that freelancers don't pursue their ideas is absolutely true.<p>Premise 4, that HackerNews has talented people with good ideas is also absolutely true.<p>Now comes the key--he's offering $8K (plus the value of his marketing expertise) for 50% of the company.<p>Let's be generous and assume the marketing consulting is worth $7K.

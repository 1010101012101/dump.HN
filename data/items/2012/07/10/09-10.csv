Market pricing would probably be higher for at least some taxis.  (it was bad enough that whenever I didn't want to be seriously hassled, I'd use a hotel car, at a negotiated rate.  I'm fine with spending $20/hr for an S320 with driver and then tipping him 100%.)<p>The big problem with regulation in general is that it sets a single value, static in time and across preferences, as both floor and ceiling.  For some things, that might make sense (""levels of acceptable poison in baby formula""), but for other things it doesn't make sense (""housing"").<p>For Bangkok, I think the right thing would be to encourage public transit over taxis, but to encourage taxis over private cars.  Charging a per-day fee to have a vehicle inside the city (similar to London), combined with actual traffic law enforcement, open access to getting a taxi medallion once you pass minimum qualifications, and either market rates or at least fair rates for taxi rides, would probably go a long way.<p>If taxis substitute for several cars, increasing taxis should decrease congestion.  That is the London model, but London taxi drivers are kind of the polar opposite of Bangkok taxi drivers.  Other SE Asian taxi drivers are fine, though -- Hong Kong and Singapore -- and it's easy to convert taxi fleets to NGV or Electric compared to private vehicles.<p>While I'm pro drug legalization, testing for meth in drivers would probably be worthwhile too.  I always checked the eyes of any driver I used, since so many of them were tweaked out of their minds and thus even more unsafe than usual.

To generate a 2% return on $100m @ 12.5% implies $16m of distributable profits.  Assuming 40% of GitHub is net profit (a generous estimate), this implies $40m in revenue.<p>That represents 476k 'micro' subscribers in one year, 277k 'small' subscribers, 151k 'medium' subscribers.  Cheapest business plan (bronze) would require 133k;  most expensive (platinum) would require 16.7k subscriptions.  Github announced 1 million users on 21 September 2011.  I can't find any details about current #s or the % of paying users.<p>Remember that all these numbers double if GitHub only has 20% net profit (bear in mind this would be 2.5% higher than the insurance industry, which is an extraordinarily predictable and profitable industry, and oil/gas, the most profitable industry, sits at 25%).<p>So while not 'spectacular' it's not at all obvious whether they can generate the sales required to generate the return necessary, and the optimistic attitude of people posting here without any numbers to support their conclusions is a bit disturbing (not a reflection on parent's comment, but in general).<p>Looking at the numbers I'll make the following observations:<p>- the total market size of potential GitHub users has a fairly low limit (somewhere in the 10s of millions I would guess)<p>- GitHub has some popularist advantages but ultimately competes on price as far as I can tell (I've started moving to Bitbucket because I see no point in paying for something I can get for free, and the recent hack shows GitHub doesn't offer better security AFAIT);  as soon as they gain a larger market share there's no reason to believe competitors won't want in on the action, and as GP points out, switching repository hosts is really easy<p>- while it looks like they'll be able to generate that 2% return over the next few years I'm struggling to see them generating a <i>much</i> more interesting return based on the numbers I'm looking at<p>- I have a feeling people are confusing feelings of ""GitHub is cool and I like it"" for implying that ""GitHub should do well as a profit generating business for its investors"";  they are also probably fantasizing about having $100m invested in their own startups and taking criticism as personal attacks on this 'plan'",1341911954

Pollution is terrible, and traffic is appalling - often a journey which should take 20 minutes takes hours, and safety standards are very low - the most popular form of taxi is a pick-up truck with bench seats in the back which is really unsafe in the event of an accident. They desperately need to encourage more public transport and get rid of some of the cars/trucks on the road to prevent rush-hour gridlock and massive pollution.<p>The easiest way to clear up the roads for public transport is to make driving more expensive and use some of that money for improvements in the public infrastructure. I doubt they'll ever do it, but they could do worse than follow the example of London with a congestion charge for central areas, and use the money to subsidise public transport, which is underused at present (because the train is so expensive, and the buses are so slow due to all the other traffic).",1341911252

I've dabbled in Clojure before, and the mention of Leiningen in the context of Light Field worried me a bit (getting Clojure, Leiningen, etc working on my Linux system was quite a chore).<p>However, installation of Light Field was a breeze and I'm puttering around. Links to basic how tos would be more helpful, and I'm sure you'll be getting to that. But for now, thanks, it is looking awesome!",1341910928

My theory is that Python gets good press because nobody <i>has</i> to use Python, so the people who don't like it just use a different language instead of complaining. Obviously, this does not hold for JavaScript.<p>If you're going to complain about language choices, don't force everybody on Python!<p>I can't comment on Ruby because I have never had to use it.<p>What <i>would</i> be perfect is Scheme in the browser. And, apparently, we almost had it except marketing or management forced Eich to make it look like Java resulting in JavaScript.",1341910916

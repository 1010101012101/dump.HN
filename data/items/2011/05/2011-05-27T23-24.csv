For such an important decision with such wide-ranging consequences, where you go to school is relatively hard to screw up. Undergraduate education is mostly foolish and cult-like behavior--Go Blue!--in a pretty setting where you can find an education and lifelong friends if you look for them. When people recommend a school they are usually recommending the cult. I went to Freshman orientation on my 18th birthday. I had been away from home a week and living down the street from the State Department and the White House when the Pentagon went boom. GW was my training ground for adulthood.

I believe Vietnam has a very similar culture compared to China.)<p>The most intuitive way to explain why 'being fatter' is regarded as a complement is this: People often say 'you look different' when they see each other after a long time. Now of course there are two way provided the person looks relatively okay, that is being fatter or thinner. However, thinner might imply that he/she was sick or something that caused him/her to lose weight. So saying 'you look fatter' is a way of saying you're doing well. In fact, Asian people tend to be thinner -- even in the US -- gttp://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparebar.jsp?ind=91&cat=2  .

Because what's key in a disruptive technology is that it creates a situation where you have a hard decision to make.

But its necessary for long-term survival, but doesn't guarantee it.<p>The iPad is a no-brainer.  If it does well then Apple does really well.  There's no dilemma.

2593434,comment,2592399,2593409,6,0,saurik,,,"Upgrading to Python 3 is simply not an option for me at this time as I am depending on libraries that still require me to be using Python 2: Python 2->3 is an ""all or nothing"" endeavor due to the horrendously incompatible way they have handled this transition. I mean: the fact that five years /have/ passed and Python 3 is still a silly pipe dream for almost all users of Python should tell you something about how poorly this was done.<p>Now, of course, to the extent to which I can, I've used Python 2.7's ""from __future__ import"" mechanism to pull as many features as I can from Python 3 to help transition, but even that has been stupidly painful: importing Python 3's gratuitously different division operator (which you can't automatically process and convert as you need to know whether the denominator is a float or an integer) was very very VERY painful on all of my careful image processing code (suddenly getting, or not getting, half pixel offsets and widths in various places).<p>Meanwhile, I don't see any benefit at all to me making these changes... requiring ""as"" instead of a comma for exceptions?... /removing/ the 2.7 ability to mark a string constant with a b-prefix, forcing an ambiguity between 2.6 str and 3.0 bytes? Are you seriously telling me that these were so important as to cause there to be a five year rift in the language community?<p>In all seriousness, a better usage of my time (rather than messing around porting my 2.x code to 3.x code) would have been to make a patch to Python 3.x to let you ""from __future__ import hindsight"" to let you use Python 2.x syntax with the Python 3.x interpreter, at which point 99% of these incompatibilities would be irrelevant. Of course, hindsight /is/ 20/20: I can't go back in time and reinvest that time better; but, I certainly have learned my lesson about using Python.",1306538917

Here is the 2nd design goal and its rationale, from 1996 draft specification[1]:<p>> 2. XML shall support a wide variety of applications.<p>> No design elements shall be adopted which would impair the usability of XML documents in other contexts such as print or CD-ROM, nor in applications other than network browsing. Examples of such applications include:<p>>    validating authoring tools<p>>    batch validators<p>>    simple filters which understand the XML document structure<p>>    normalizers<p>>    formatting engines<p>>    translators to render XML documents into other languages (e.g. RTF, TeX, ...)<p>It should also be noted, that XML included the DTD specification from the very beginning. Although much different from the current state of affairsstill no namespaces and not quite the flexibility of XSDit's nevertheless an important distinction.<p>As you might imagine, such core concept were further developed, which resulted in the 1.0 spec of XML Namespaces[2] (called xml-names at that time) and with XSD soon following suite.<p>To say that JSON and XML are anything alike is unfair. As JSON's own RFC states, it was meant to be merely:<p>> JSON's design goals were for it to be minimal, portable, textual, and a subset of JavaScript.<p>No concern is given for its interoperability between vastly different environments, nor did it try to position itself as a replacement for XML, which would surely be known to its creators at that time. Subsequently, there's no mention of validation or extendibility.<p>Of course the concept of XML Namespaces is well unique to XML. Even the JSON Schema[3], does not introduce anything similar, but just merely provides an optional meta-document, describingor should I sayhinting, about how the document may look like:<p>> It is acknowledged that JSON documents come in a variety of structures, and JSON is unique in that the structure of stored data structures often prescribes a non-ambiguous definite JSON representation.<p>> Cumulatively JSON Schema acts as a meta-document.<p>The JSON schema is of course still a <i>draft</i> today, and has received almost no adoption[4] from the community.<p>This should be, however, obvious, given the fact that it took a whole 4 years for JSON Schema to emerge (such a long time in the noughties), suggesting just how non-essential value it must hold for its users.<p>What I'm honestly afraid, is that JSON Schema will ultimately get our attention. But neither because we will seek it for its technical brilliance, which it hasn't got, nor because we will seek it for its user-friendliness, which is unimpressive, but because we will be <i>desperate</i>.<p>After enough developers will get seduces by the carelessness of JSONblimey, I don't have to think <i>at all</i>, and it's endorsed by some bloggerswe will embrace JSON Schema and, surely, invent a whole novel ecosystem, just to <i>deal with the mess</i>, that such fuck open Web, I'd rather just output garbage, because it is more convenient right now attitude could only bring.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/dd-1996-0001.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/dd-1996-0001.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-zyp-json-schema-03.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-zyp-json-schema-03.txt</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://json-schema.org/implementations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://json-schema.org/implementations.html</a>",1306538513

Just because there is another browser that is significant competition doesn't necessarily mean good things. It's especially true if any one browser becomes too dominant, then all the other browsers have to conform to that browsers decisions.<p>I'm not saying that Chrome is going to become the IE6 of 2015, but if there is ever a point where Chrome can either do what is best for the web/user or be better for Google's bottom line they will always be choosing the latter.<p>Look at the state of flashblock and adblock in Chrome. It may have changed, but when I last looked at them they were both complete crap compared to their firefox equivalents. Google has very little incentive to improve their plugin system to make them more effective, but that would be counterproductive to what they are trying to achieve. I wouldn't be at all surprised if there comes a point when they are trying to push alternate formats for streaming video over Flash and it will suddenly become very easy to block Flash effectively and efficiently in Chrome.<p>I use Chrome and I like it, but I generally trust Mozilla to push for the best things on the web than any for-profit company, even Google.",1306537305

2) Often, I have to go to my email and activate the account.
3) Entering and remembering a password is not as simple as it sounds. New York Times is a good example on how not to do it: <a href=""http://twitter.com/vpdn/status/1620213111"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/vpdn/status/1620213111</a>

My interest in flash is not for the love of flash, but flash as a target platform, using a language better than AS3 and development tools better than Flash or Flex builder. HaXe is an interesting experiment, but I would still want a Lisp on there.<p>You will never see me defend Flex and AIR. I use Raphael.js now for my system's dashboard, for example. But the flash run time has replaced ActiveX and XPCOM as a non-standard standard that you can reach out to stuff like client-side storage, explicit sockets and data streams, audio and video, along with the usual eye-candy stuff.<p>Accepting something as fate is not the same as advocating it.",1240995508

It's pretty disgusting to say the least.<p>You can see this from day one, really.

584771,comment,584482,584482,0,0,lucumo,,,"I'd love to see some numbers on ""Lazy Registration"". How many users does it save? How much effort goes into implementing it?<p>I've seen the idea before and I'm not really convinced. Sure, it sounds like a great idea, but let me offer some thoughts.<p>1. I have never been to 11 of the 12 sites mentioned in the article. Before I read this article, I knew exactly one site where lazy registration is actually practised: Stack Overflow. The idea has been floating around for some one or two years now. It hasn't really catched on. To me this suggests that many authors find it difficult to implement.<p>While difficulty in itself is not a problem, the time and effort invested in something needs to pay off, and it needs to pay off more than investing it into another feature. Opportunity costs apply here too.<p>2. How many potential users really care about registration? Does a ""registration reddit-style"" really put off that many people? In my experience, people will just pick their normal username and mash a laughably simple password into the appropriate box. There isn't much cognitive overhead there. This will, in my opinion, really only be a problem to people who have never registered an account before, anywhere.<p>Sure, you need to convince them that your product is useful. They won't explore further if they aren't convinced that it may provide some value to them. But it's probably a lot easier to put a tour on your website than to implement lazy registration.<p>3. If it does indeed give more users, do the extra users remain users for the same amount of time, or do they switch more easily to competitors? What happens to the users that you would've gotten with registration as well? Do they switch more easily? It seems to me that that's a very real possibility.<p>Currently, my intuition tells me to just use a registration form if you need it. In places where you don't need your users to be logged in, don't require them to be. Just let them do as much as possible without an account, but I wouldn't go for ""unregistered accounts"". That's too much effort for something of which you don't know how it will turn out.",1240993399

584768,comment,583968,584668,0,0,potatolicious,,,"""Can you imagine the impact on society of 20k freshman attending some Y Combinator-esque hacker / entrepreneurial program every year?""<p>I'm at the University of Waterloo in Canada, we have something that is (conceptually) similar to your idea, but it falls flat on its face for a few reasons. First, a bit of background:<p>- It's a residence where entrepreneurial-minded students can apply to live. The hope is that close proximity of a bunch of smart, ambitious people will serve as a pseudo-incubator for startups.<p>- The residence hosts workshops and invites speakers to shed some insight on the startup process, and hooks students up with technological resources (servers, bandwidth, hardware, etc) to build their projects. The residence takes no stake in any companies.<p>Now, I was there for its inaugural semester, and the whole thing fails for many reasons:<p>- Unlike YC, which draws from a pool of talented hackers and businesspeople, the residence draws from a pool of untalented, ambitious dreamers. Of the 70 or so people selected to live there, I can count the number of capable hackers on one hand - the rest were hopelessly unable to code at any level that approaches hacker proficiency. Most people were CS or engineering majors, most people also fail at producing their own side projects. There were people who could write Java, but didn't know what MySQL was - in short, the people there were technically incompetent, and even the ones who were able, didn't have the huge breadth of skills necessary to put on many hats.<p>This is a problem to most, if not all colleges - the number of people who have the depth <i>and</i> breadth of skill necessary to run a small, lean startup simply do not exist in large enough numbers at a single college. Maybe if 10  schools gathered together they'd have enough talent between them to pull this off.<p>- Zero business knowledge. The vast majority of the ideas that came out of that place were your standard ""build app, pray for users, show ads to them, ???, profit!"" formula. There were several econ majors selected to live there, I suppose in hopes that they will provide some business knowledge. They too were clueless about business models and weren't much help at all.<p>I did meet a couple capable people there that I still keep in touch with, so I suppose it's not all that bad. But IMHO building an incubator during college is a waste of time, especially at the scale you're suggesting. You can't will a successful startup into existence - you need talented people, and good luck finding 20k talented college freshmen with a strong portfolio of past work <i>and</i> entrepreneurial drive.",1240993216

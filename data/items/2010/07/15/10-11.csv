They are terrible languages! They do, however, manage to get the job done. Coupled with the browsers sandboxing, standardised communications mechanisms and programming practices - and of course the all important easy distribution of web apps, since everybody already has a browser - and you have a good, solid and convenient application distribution (and execution) platform. Sadly, until I can choose what language I want to do my client-side work in (since Javascript is a clunky hack of a lnaguage and other languages are more appropriate for some kinds of work), I will not like client-side web programming. Perhaps native client will save me there. Hopefully.",1279191338

1517429,comment,1517291,1517291,0,0,charliepark,,,"I would be more than happy to sling e-mails back and forth with you on this, as I was in your same place a few years back. If you're interested in connecting, take a look at my Hacker News profile and go to the ""stalky links"" page, and you can get my e-mail.<p>Anyway, I'd strongly recommend that you do three things.<p>1) Check out Meetup.com or various Ruby forums to find out if there's a Ruby / Rails Group in your geographic area. Go to the meetings, meet the people there, and begin to build a local network of support.\n2) Try to find out if there are any web dev shops in your area. Even with your limited experience, you might still be able to score a gofer position that just lets you be in the office. As you're there, you could begin sitting in on coding (observing a pair programming session, or even riding shotgun in the session), and eventually taking on small projects with a code review from someone who knows what they're doing.\n3) Start a blog, where you document the issues you run into, the solutions you develop, the resources you find useful, and the discoveries you make.<p>To the specifics you asked about, yes, Ruby does handle databases. It allows you to connect with various types of databases and make various calls to put stuff into the database and get stuff out of the database. I'm not entirely sure what you mean by ""scripting"", but if you mean simply writing small bits of code (methods) that can be called from other methods and that can take input, process it, and give you output, then, yes, Ruby does that.<p>As nudge mentioned (and as you probably know?), Ruby is the programming language, Rails is a library of pre-written Ruby code that shortens development time. With your background, you <i>might</i> prefer learning Ruby first, but a lot of web programmers (like me) were attracted to Ruby because Rails let them get going quickly with projects. A lot of the database connections and other fiddly bits are taken care of for you. I'd encourage you to focus on learning Rails first, in the same way that I'll encourage you in a minute to become familiar with jQuery, rather than learning javascript. More on that in a sec.<p>Rails does have some danger zones, though. First, you have to learn some Rails-specific code (the names of helper methods and so on), which might not work outside of Rails, and which might confuse you if you try other Ruby frameworks (Sinatra is another framework). Second, because Rails abstracts a lot of the code, you won't necessarily know what's going on behind the scenes. If your goal is to become a master programmer, that could be bad. If your goal is to <i>make stuff</i>, it's not a bad thing at all, as you'll have time to learn what's in the black box down the road. Third, Rails evolves quickly, and if you're getting started now, you'll find a lot of old Rails tutorials that simply won't make sense, and that won't work with new-ish versions of Rails code. Be wary of any Rails tutorial older than about 6 months. Ruby-heavy tutorials are safer, as Ruby doesn't change a lot. But if the tutorial doesn't specifically mention Rails 2.3.x or Rails 3.0, it might be a bit of a gamble. This is exponentially true for books about learning Rails. Unless the book says ""Rails 3.0"" on the cover (and I doubt any of them do, as Rails 3.0 isn't even out in its final form yet), don't buy them. Borrow them from the library or a friend. Oh ... one book would be <a href=""http://railstutorial.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railstutorial.org/</a>, although I haven't actually read it.<p>You also mentioned that you won't need to learn javascript. Your best bet here is to become familiar with jQuery. jQuery is like Rails, in that it's a bunch of pre-written code that lets you do stuff quickly. Want to set up tabs that hide/display info? Want to play with dynamic updates to your site without reloading the entire page? Want a pop-over box to fade into place when the user clicks on a link? jQuery's your huckleberry.<p>A few really good resources (and I'm sure others can add to this):\n- Ryan Bates's Railscasts series of tutorials\n- StackOverflow (holy cats is this site useful)\n- <a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubyonrails.org</a>\n- <a href=""http://github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com</a> (if you're using Rails, you'll need to know about Github soon enough, whether you post projects there or simply read others' code)<p>There are a few e-books online that teach Rails and Ruby. For Rails, check out <a href=""http://railstutorial.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railstutorial.org/</a>. For Ruby, go to <a href=""http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/</a>.<p>In terms of hosting your projects online, you'll probably be fine with a basic account at DreamHost (who I love). I also host at MediaTemple (who I can't recommend) and SliceHost (who I can). I've also heard a lot about Linode. But with SliceHost and Linode, you'll also be getting into server management and super-basic sysadmin stuff. Since your goal is to learn web programming, I wouldn't worry about that stuff just yet. I'd steer you towards DreamHost. I don't get a kickback for that, although I do have some kind of referral code thingy that I can give you if you'd <i>like</i> to use it. :)<p>As I mentioned above, if you want to e-mail me for help getting started, or for other random advice, just go to my ""stalky links"" page from my profile and you'll find my e-mail. I'd be happy to chat more.",1279190666
1517428,comment,1517032,1517143,0,0,dkersten,,,"Very little of what you said is specific to the web. The only difference is that if you build on top of the browser, the distribution system and distributed services layer is done for you. But you can do all of this in desktop apps too and more efficiently - but at a higher development cost.<p><i>it's on the web, they can collect (and sell) statistics much more easily</i><p>Nothing is stopping you from connecting your desktop software back to a central server in order to store statistics.<p><i>And stream ads.</i><p>I can stream adds too - I open a socket to my add streaming server and it sends me the next one. Or whatever. Nothing novel about the web here.<p><i>And perform proprietary operations without exposing their algorithm.</i><p>Again, I can do this too by following a browser/server model - I simply connect to my server and do it there. Desktop apps can use the internet too, you know.<p><i>There's no way to make a ""no-cd"" crack for web-based software; there's no instruction you can short-cut to get the premium version for free.</i><p>Once again, this is in no way specific to the web.<p>The advantage that web apps have is that everybody already has browsers installed and these browsers already contain a lot of what applications need: a way to display an interface, a means of scripting client-side in order to perform local tasks without having to cross the network and a standardised communications protocol. On the server side, there are a set of frameworks to make use of this. You could do this with other apps too, if you really wanted. The only thing web apps have over other kinds of apps is ease of distribution - because everyone already has web browsers.<p>On the flipside, desktop apps have advantages too. Maily performance and fine grained control over the computer and interface. In theory all of this will become available in browsers <i>eventually</i>, but honestly, as long as javascript is the only reasonable choice i have for client-side programming, I'm not going to be much of a fan (though NativeClient could fix this!).<p>If everything is moving to the browser, why are we still using fancy operating systems? Really, all we need is some local storage (for caching things, mainly), some ethernet and wifi drivers, usb drivers (for reading external drives, cameras etc), memory card reader drivers, some kind of video driver and.. well, a browser. No need for fancy GUI systems (outside of the browser), no need for other apps. No need for media players (outside of the browser) and so on. I suppose things are slowly moving this direction. Unless native client or something similar takes off, though, I'm not terribly interested - Javascript is a terrible hack of a language.<p>Ignoring whatever the servers will run on, of course.",1279190648

The attr_accessor macro is actually adding getters and setters. The implementions used for the getters and setters are equivalent to those that you would write in java. As mentioned elsewhere you can switch in custom implementations as required but, as in java, the majority of the time the default implementations are sufficient. The difference is that it in ruby you don't need to write the getters and setters until you need the customisation.",1279188769

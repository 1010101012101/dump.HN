I also started by reading lots of papers from the ACM DL, reading books from my school library, etc. If I could do it over again, I'd start programming earlier.<p>It sounds like you're trying to learn about AI before you work on applying anytime classifiers in an application. My suggestion is that you interleave the studying with working, so that you can do <i>directed</i> study rather than breadth-first traversal through a huge subfield in CS.<p>Start with a very modest goal for classification and work on building a neural network for that. Guess about which particular algorithm and feature vector structure to use. Work to improve your results for a while, then go back to reading in order to pick up a new technique to plug in. Consider setting a more challenging goal. Iterate on that.",1285372722

1725838,comment,1725395,1725395,0,0,nhashem,,,"At this point in Perl's history, there is no such thing as a mid-level Perl developer.<p>I'm actually a Los Angeles Perl developer and I keep telling my HR department to either look for college kids with basically no professional programming experience at all, or senior candidates that they're willing to pay at least $90,000.  Looking for ""some Perl programmer guy"" with some experience that you're looking to pay $70,000 is pointless, because they don't exist.<p>Perl's lack of a ""sexy web startup framework"" (e.g. Rails) essentially wiped out a whole ""generation"" of developers.  I'll be the first to admit it's a lot harder to bang out your brilliant ""It's like Facebook... but for cats!"" startup idea in Perl and its respective frameworks.  If you want a decent foundation, you'll use something like Rails or Django.  If you just want to bang it out, you'll just inline some crappy PHP code in your HTML.  Eventually your company will grow, you'll have different kinds of problems to worry about, like, ""this third-party partner doesn't have an API so I need to write a spider that logs into their UI and scrapes the data we need"" or ""I need to parse this DB log to figure out the frequency of SELECT queries,"" but since 97% of startups[1] don't ever get to that point, Perl didn't get a lot of love in 2005-2007.  After all, we're on Hacker News, not Mid-Sized Company News.<p>So if you were a Perl hacker in 2004, 2005, you either loved the flexibility and ""whipitupitude"" Perl gave you for your back-end operations, and now it's 5 years later and you're  a senior engineer looking for a commensurate salary.  Or you decided to crank out CatBook in RoR until Zuckerberg sued you into oblivion and then you just got another Ruby job afterwards.<p>For what it's worth, I would encourage the HR departments that Randall mentions to look at new college grads.  More than any other language, I feel it's one of the easiest languages to learn regardless of your previous experience, mainly because of TMTOWTDI[2] you can write it in whatever syntax format you're already experienced in.  I see a lot of college kids who came from Java and at first their code is full of HammerFactorySchematicFactorySchematicFactories, and while it's pretty silly, it'll work until they learn better, and in three months they're essentially as productive as the theoretical mid-level Perl programmer anyway.<p>[1] This statistic is POOMA[3].<p>[2] There's More Than One Way To Do It<p>[3] Pulled Out Of My Ass",1285372444

I went to my first networking conference, SXSW a few years ago, and met one person, who intro-ed me to three others. Contact continued when we were all on the same flight home, and I offered to drive them from the airport. These three then intro-ed me to new people, who then intro-ed me to more... this is the best way, imho, to create honest connections that don't disappear once you leave a party.<p>Also, Twitter is a pretty easy way to continue connections after you've met someone briefly.<p>As for approaching people to initiate conversations, just do it.

It isn't PayPal or Google or any online service.<p>It's the credit card companies and the banks that control this.  The best part is, your entire business will be based on the premise that the bank lets you process.  They can drop you for whatever reason.  It's not hard.  Trust me, they'll manufacture whatever evidence they need to.  Sure, you could take them to court, but meanwhile, you are without processing.<p>No.  You cannot disrupt an industry when you rely on that industry to help you disrupt it.<p>Of course, you could bypass the credit card companies all together.  A lot of companies do this with prepaid cards.  Not only does it allow those without a credit card purchase their service.  You could create a generic pricing card.  But then you have to convince merchants to use your system, a system that has no users.  And users need to buy your cards with no merchants on board.  It's a chicken and egg problem.<p>Honestly, I think social networks will play a part in this in some manner.

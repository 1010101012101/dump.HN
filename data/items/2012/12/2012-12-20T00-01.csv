The fact that we're presently using a website that essentially serves as a crowdsourced, real-time trade journal counters that argument. The existence and wild success of engineering-focused conferences counters that argument. The proliferation of easy-to-access information for professional growth allows for a self-selecting group of people to improve their lot in life just by picking up some new skills and getting some experience with them. You can learn a new skill literally by browsing the Internet these days. As such, I don't really view the knowledge worker as a person at risk of stagnation without actually making an effort to be lazy.<p>There are some people who feel that they already know everything they need to know, and don't want to better themselves. It is entirely attitudinal, and in no way unique to the ""knowledge worker"" classification. I would argue the problem is far more significant in other industries, such as manufacturing and other heavy industry. When a specific kind of job replaced by a machine, or an entire industry gets outsourced to another country, the individuals previously responsible for that kind of work are likely not to have been trained for any other function.

In that situation, the patent examiner need only show invalidity by ""a preponderance of the evidence,"" which is colloquially summarized as 50.000001%, just enough to tip the balance of probability.  It's also commonly phrased as ""more likely than not.""<p>(EDIT:  Strictly speaking, the burden of proof applies only to <i>facts</i>, not to the ultimate conclusion. Here, the facts --- namely what the Hillis and Nomura prior-art references say --- are are essentially beyond dispute, although I suppose conceivably Apple might find some technical grounds to allege, as a matter of fact, that at the time in question, persons of ordinary skill supposedly <i>would not have understood</i> those references to mean A or B or C.)<p>Perhaps more importantly, in the court case, a non-expert judge and jury had to assess the prior art.

Using the legal system to create prospective deterrent effects, as ours does, is not compatible with mechanisms that discourage suits, because ultimately that makes rule breaking profitable for rule breakers.<p>I also strongly disagree that we need special rules for patent litigation. There is a rhyme and reason to the rules for cost shifting, one that doesn't depend on the subject matter of the litigation. What you seem to be implying is that patent litigants are less likely than other kind of litigants to being meritorious suits, and indeed that a patent suit is more likely than not non-meritorious. If that is the case, then the problem isn't who pays for a losing suit, but the law that creates enough wiggle room that these loser cases are being brought.<p>The way our litigation system fights meritless litigation is to make it relatively cheap to dispose of meritless suits. As an outsider to the practice, it seems to me that one of the big problems with patent suits in practice is that it's a relatively complex, fact-specific inquiry to determine patent validity. The usual way to address this is to add additional, easy to prove thresholds that let a case be dismissed without consideration of involved questions.",1355962908

When you write simple bindings (for example someProperty: otherPropert ? ""yes.png"" : ""no.png"") the QML engine actually detects these simple cases and doesn't invoke the javascript interpreter when it needs to evaluate the expression, but handles it internally instead. Also if you don't want to do things in javascript you really don't have to as calling QObject slots is super easy. If you stick to simple bindings and write your logic in C++, the javascript interpreter won't have much to do.",1355961633

Each salt state provided by the project is also intelligent about its use of resources - for example, if you have multiple pkg.installed, the list of available packages will be pulled only once and all states will be able to determine quickly if they need to run.<p>- Abstracting configuration data vs methods<p>Methods -> salt states; Configuration data -> grains/pillar. Grains are kind of attributes that belong to a host (like hostname, system version, installed packages, available ips, etc.), while pillar is a plugin system that can provide external data (it can be used like puppetdb too; I&#x27;ve got a plugin that pulls json files from s3 and talks makes it available as a simple hash for example). If you know chef, think attributes/databags (but better).<p>- PuppetDB as a canonical reference of the state of all our infrastructure.<p>It doesn&#x27;t actually provide this out of the box, but provides the needed elements so this is trivial. Basically you can query all your nodes from the salt server (or nodes can query each other). You just need to extract the bits you need and save them to whatever destination you want. For example on the server run `salt -G &#x27;roles:database&#x27; grains.item mem_total` and save the data. You can also define a &quot;returner&quot; which is a plugin that handles the data you get back and for example implement something that writes the data back into your information store/cmdb.<p>- Exported resources (also relying on PuppetDB), enabling propagation of information about new nodes to all others.<p>Pillar again. Although depending on what you want to achieve, you may want to enable some querying between the nodes, so that one of them can just broadcast some message at runtime and work on results.",1390561038

7114296,comment,7113320,7114250,2,0,sergiosgc,,,"We switched away from puppet towards Salt.  The broad stroked opinion is that salt covers all of puppet &#x27;s use cases, with advantages in terms of both performance and extensibility.<p>It is idempotent; there is a central configuration db (a couple of options,  actually; we use pillar,  a YAML set of files for its simplicity). Exported resources are handled a bit differently (you pull data from servers at config time instead of pushing at export time) but cover the same functionality. The same functionality covers software configuration inventory.<p>Where it excels is in performance. Our deployment runs on puppet took some 15min, salt handles them in 30s.<p>I also like its codebase. It is clear and well documented, easy to extend. I am biased towards python instead of Ruby, so take my opinion with a grain of salt (heh:-)",1390560730

The first chart shows that Princeton &quot;crashed&quot; or died between 2010 and 2011, since that&#x27;s when that graph tanked.  Since that data isn&#x27;t good to make their Tu Quoque argument (that Princeton &quot;will die&quot;) they are being satirical and ignore it.  The second graph shows that more and more Non-Princeton articles are published.  But this is due to more and more non-Princeton publications.  Princeton has a fairly static amount of output, as the world&#x27;s universities started outputing scholarly articles in English, you would expect Princeton&#x27;s share to drop.<p>More interesting would be if its share of what it is trying to go for, Nobel Prize Laureates, publication in Science and Nature, whatever - were on the decline.  This isn&#x27;t addressed, just a global proportion of all scholarly articles: not Princeton&#x27;s aim.<p>However, Facebook&#x27;s goal is to get a majority of daily active users.<p>The second to last graph actually shows a pretty good case that larger institutions (by enrolment) correlate with search relevancy. But that is not a case study of an institution whose enrolment fell, which is what it would take to make a parallel case with the Princeton paper.  They would have to pick an institution whose enrollment fell with its relevancy, and then show that Princeton is on the same track.<p>As it stands, it is not &quot;longitudinal&quot; but just a static cross-section of enrollment and mentions.  Perhaps enrolment is static at all major institutions, regardless of search relevancy, and their enrollment remains full even if they become irrelevant?<p>This small switcheroo is a major one, and shows why the article has to be satirical.<p>Of course they did respond quickly :)  It seems to indicate that Facebook did some research, but then found their results too weak to publish straight.",1390560667

It&#x27;s similar to some LED torches, that use PWM to control brightness. They turn on and off really fast, and the more time they spend off, the dimmer the light. Yet you think it&#x27;s a constant source of light, with a large enough frequency. For dithering, you just need a large resolution.",1390558325

Noöne seems willing to conceive of a system where secrets are the exceptional, special case and not the norm.<p>This is frankly confirmation bias. Secrets <i>are</i> the exception in our government, and in most governments, because they are by nature public entities. It&#x27;s just that you place very little value on the other information out there (and so does the government, and so do other governments, which is why they&#x27;re not secret in the first place).<p>The topic of these conversations starts out with the presumption that the secrets are the important bits to discuss. That makes it incredibly difficult to recognize the presence of other pieces of information right in front of your eyes, because it looks like background noise.<p>Unlike mr_luc, I do have a solution, but it&#x27;s not a politically feasible one: a world government. There&#x27;s a quibble there about the need for things like wiretaps for law enforcement, but I&#x27;d be willing to bet that it&#x27;s a lot less necessary to have operational security even for things like that.",1390558019

Wouldn&#x27;t it directly benefit the company hiring them to not hire them?<p>In our cloud service, these guys are the first-line of defense in troubleshooting customer issues. They&#x27;re the guys customers talk to and they follow a standard troubleshooting guide before pinging one of the on-call engineers. So it can&#x27;t exactly be automated. And trust me, if that were possible, it would&#x27;ve been done. In a way, that&#x27;s also one of the reasons this stuff is outsourced, companies don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of doing the hiring themselves for these roles.<p>> Also, I don&#x27;t like your characterization of people based on where they work. A person may choose to work in BK/McDonalds but that doesn&#x27;t imply anything (positive or negative) about their capability.<p>Sorry, I probably wasn&#x27;t clear. That absolutely wasn&#x27;t the message I was trying to get across. I understand working there doesn&#x27;t mean anything about their capability and often it is a stepping stone to something greater (ex: college/high-school students). What I meant to say was the skill level here is the same. In effect, they just need to know their way around a machine and speak good English. Heck, they&#x27;d do a better job at it considering how poor the outsourced folks are at it. They&#x27;d even have more fun because there&#x27;s still room for the occasional intellectual stimulation and creativity within these roles. And they&#x27;d be better pay too. Overall, it will be a better use of their time and they&#x27;d have more job satisfaction.",1390557911

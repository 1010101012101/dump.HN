4217161,comment,4212568,4214901,1,0,smsm42,,,"Why PHP references should be like pointers? It is ""confusing"" only if you have wrong preconception about how PHP references should be. If you let it go and learn what they actually are, there's nothing confusing about it. Just don't let you preconceived notion about what it ""should"" be block your learning about what it actually is.<p>Most of ""other languages"" similar to PHP don't even have concept close to references, except for C++. Similarity with C++ may be briefly confusing, but it's not unheard of that in different languages concepts meant to achieve the same thing work differently. Expecting PHP would match C++ in every detail or would have to invent completely new terminology altogether makes little sense.<p>>> What's the benefit of doing it this way instead of the way just about every other language ever does it?<p>""Every other language ever"" doesn't do it in any particular way. Perl has pointer-like references and they are nightmarish to work with. Languages like Ruby or Java pass everything by value or by object reference depending on how you look on it, since everything is an object. Some don't have the concept of references all. Low-level languages like C/C++ have pointers. In some languages variables are not mutable, so the whole question is moot. Saying that ""every other language ever"" does some specific thing in this regard and only PHP does it differently is meaningless - different languages do it completely different, and PHP has its own way. It doesn't match your favorite one - fine, everybody is entitled to have one's favorite ways, but that does not make PHP ""weird"" or wrong in any way, just as it doesn't make C, Java, Python or Perl wrong.",1341820732

Becoming the performance-based ad spin-off, recruiting the superb sales people? In the same way that a web celeb can bring a huge boost to anything they start, so can a newspaper drive instant publicity to a new venture of their own. Took the major networks here years before they started buying up each of a site re: cars, dating, travel, parenting, etc.<p>Is it a concern of driving away potential advertisers in those fields? Anti-competitive behaviour?<p>In Australia, fantasy comps (based around Australian Rules Football) are very popular and a huge boost to the big newspapers. I've been told that recent newspaper strategy meetings often boil down to ""Wish we could come up with another thing like (insert fantasy comp name here)."" Give me a meeting and eventual minimal shareholding and I'll give you five ideas straight up.<p>---<p>One example of the newspaper approach is in restaurant reviews. Before and after the success of sites like Yelp, newspapers here have continued with their review-a-restaurant-a-week approach. No categorised index of local restaurants. No repository of reviews beyond those that hit print. No crowdsourcing.<p>For a long time online, I turned repeatedly to a restaurant index (Miettas) with a crappy design, weak search and dated content just because it had remotely reliable and professional reviews that a Yelp-type site didn't have.

4217119,comment,4211479,4214371,1,0,drewcrawford,,,"The way this argument is going is a very eloquent ""he said, he said"".  I'd like to push it into a better discussion.  Could you drop the rhetoric about ""parroting the WWDC line"" and ""Apple stumbling about"", the ad-hominem characterizations of developers who haven't implemented a GC, etc.?  I'm going to require you to provide hard facts or examples to support your claims, and not present conclusions as arguments, and not muddy the waters.<p>> The ObjC runtime is poorly designed in part due to the fact that it fails to cleanly and adequately represent the necsessary metadata to support new features, and thus requires repeated ABI breakage as Apple stumbles about trying to implement enhancements.<p>The ABI was ""changed"" once.  When I say it was ""changed"", I really mean that the new ABI was released for the first time on new architectures that did not previously have an ABI at all, and the old architectures' ABI did not change.  Assuming that your objection to ABI ""breakage"" was compatibility-based in nature, this objection would be unfounded.<p>You have also failed to make a claim that any particular feature is both useful and unimplementable, and also failed to support such a claim.  Please make and support claims, not conclusions.<p>> As for accepting Apple's assertions about GC at face value -- this is the same organization that proudly trumpeted their poor implementation of GC at WWDCs past, and migrated their entire set of Mac OS frameworks to support it.<p>To be fair, garbage collection was released before iOS was released.  Apple's position is today, and has always been, that garbage collection is infeasible on iOS.  What has changed between 2006 and 2012 is that it now makes a lot of sense from both a developer mindshare point of view and an Apple engineer cost/benefit point of view to make Mac OS be as close to iOS as possible, because that's where the money is.  There are very good reasons why (e.g. non-deterministic finalization) it is impossible to share code and illogical to share engineers between ARC and GC codebases.<p>> GC at Apple died because of a poor implementation, political fallout from it, and lack of adequate investment in it.<p>This contradiction is baseless (e.g. unsupported), so on that basis I am not compelled to respond.  It also contradicts my discussions with engineers who were involved in the decision, so if you were to provide a basis, I have first-hand accounts with which to refute you.<p>>  Regardless of that, Apple should be capable of bringing more computer science firepower to this problem than Mono is.<p>And here is the fundamental disconnect: you believe that currently-known GC algorithms are ""good enough"" for general use on iOS.  I do not.  Apple does not.<p>Thinking it through logically, there are three possible root causes for this disagreement:<p>1.  You and I could have a different conception of the hardware capabilities of iOS devices<p>2.  You and I could have a different conception of the performance characteristics for currently-known GC algorithms<p>3.  You and I could have a different threshold for user pain, so you might characterize a certain performance penalty as ""acceptable"" that I would characterize as ""unacceptable.""<p>We've danced a little bit around #1 and #2, and we can talk some more about those.  But I think the real issue might be #3.<p>For example, the native screen refresh rate is 60fps.  I would consider it unacceptable to skip five consecutive frames, and unacceptable to skip more than 15 frames as a sustained average over many seconds.  Mono documents ""major collections"" to take a second, which fails both criteria. [1]<p>I would also consider it unacceptable that, upon returning to the run loop (or equivalent common synchronization point), more than 15% of garbage bytes remain uncollected.  There's just not that much memory to go around.<p>At this point, I have laid out in very specific detail what I mean by ""performs acceptably"".  Now, you can either A) tell me that my demands are insane, in which case we simply have a very different idea of what ""responsive user interface"" means, and there's really nothing more to be said to convince the other.  Or, B) demonstrate that there exists some GC implementation which fulfills these requirements, and additionally demonstrate that it cannot be implemented with the current ObjC runtime.<p>I think this is the the healthiest way forward for the discussion, because it leaves open the possibility that we may learn something.  If instead we return to the things I listed in the first paragraph, I think we both have better uses of our time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://android.xamarin.com/index.php?title=Documentation/GC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://android.xamarin.com/index.php?title=Documentation/GC</a>",1341819405

In Ruby, you can use Modules to a similar effect and raise NotImplementedError on methods that were not implemented correctly. Thats maybe the hackiest thing in this collection, but there is no one-size-fits it all solution :).<p>I think the theme here is ""no static guarantees"" and thats definitely true, but after years of programming in dynamic languages, I rate those problems far lower than most others. Most of those things can be mitigated by thinking a lot about your code, which you should do anyways.",1341818882

4217040,comment,4214589,4216307,12,0,tikhonj,,,"Haskell's type system can stop a ton of errors that would not be affected by a normal type system. I've certainly run into these sorts of errors in the wild.<p>For example, the type system can differentiate mutable code from immutable code. This means you will never get a mutable data structure when you don't expect it. I've seen several rather subtle and hard-to-catch bugs in some Python code I used to work with because lists were being mutated in the wrong place.<p>Haskell also makes it much easier to create lightweight new types (with the appropriately named newtype keyword :)). This means that there is no reason not to create different types for semantically different numbers--you can tag all your specialized numbers with a special type. Now, other languages let you do this as well, but in Haskell there is neither a runtime nor a syntactic overhead: numeric literals still work (they're polymorphic), standard numeric functions still work and the runtime representation remains exactly the same. But it will ensure your functions always get the right sort of number. As a practical example, you could differentiate between px and em for CSS measurements (I'm not sure if any library does this, but it is possible).<p>The type system also makes sure that you cover all the possible cases when you consume (e.g. pattern match on) some data type. I've certainly had bugs crop up when I forget some weird edge-case. Haskell warns about this possibility at compile time.<p>For constraints that cannot easily be expressed in the type system, there is a pattern called a ""smart constructor"". This is basically a wrapper function that verifies your invariant; any function that depends on it will force you to have used this function. This way, if the invariant is violated, the code fails immediately clearly. This also makes sure that anybody using those functions actually considered the invariant.<p>There are a bunch of other uses I haven't listed. For a web development example, I believe that Yesod uses the type system to ensure that all your internal links point to valid locations in your web app.<p>This is not a an exhaustive list in the least.  The important point is that the Haskell type system can do quite a bit more than that of more popular statically typed languages like Java or C#, and, just as critically, makes using these more extensive features <i>easier</i>. There is much less overhead to creating a new type in Haskell than there is in Java, which makes it more likely that programmers will use them more extensively.<p>Now, of course no type system can possibly protect you from design or specification problems. However, there are still a whole bunch of subtle bugs that can sneak into your code but would have been caught by Haskell's type system. Most of them would probably also be caught by a good test suite, but the type system gives you most of them effectively for free. This also makes writing tests simpler because you do not have to test anything proved by the type system.",1341817776

A few points:<p><pre><code>  - their contacts and history are in covering local sport\n  - why would I read this generic coverage over ESPN and American sources who have writers in the thick of the action?\n  - in covering domestic basketball, the audience might be smaller, but the paper would have virtually no competition in covering it\n  - cover local teams and you at least have a shot of building suburb-level audiences and hit up small businesses as a result\n</code></pre>\nIn print, I understand that newspapers will generally include content such that its level meets a ratio with the advertising at hand. e.g., they might not print an extra four pages because they don't have the ads for it.<p>But online is a different case. If your writer is getting paid a fixed rate, why wouldn't you have them at capacity whenever possible, generating unique, local content for your online version? They could be creating the Final Four fluff-piece for the print version, plus writing up online-only previews and quick opinion pieces on the domestic league.

I was familiar with Go&#x27;s channel implement as well has its predecessors in Plan9 and Newsqueak. In part because I have done an implementation with the Stackless module of PyPy. The two problems I see are: 1) you don&#x27;t implement the select algorithm. 2) Go channels where implemented to handle multiple CPUs. In a simple example, this is overhead for Go. With the asynchronous queue I am not sure if you are obeying Go&#x27;s channel&#x27;s rendezvous semantics. I also suspect Go&#x27;s results may be different and closer to what you are doing if you used go channels with buffers.",1437839893

9947928,comment,9947650,9947650,0,0,jerf,,,"The problem with asking for better risk management for infosec is that &quot;better risk management&quot; pretty much comes out the same. In security terms, systems are secure when the cost of breaking the protection exceeds the value of what is being protected. In the software world, in the <i>vast</i> majority of cases, once a vulnerability is known, the cost of breaking the protection is indistinguishable from zero. The result is that it <i>superficially appears</i> that we treat things as binary risk, but in fact we are being perfectly rational.<p>Some of the rare examples of software security bugs where the attacks are <i>practical</i> but not <i>free</i>: Breaking RC4. BEAST. DDoS. The rare arbitrary code executions that require significant time to attempt due to needing to spray the heap <i>just</i> right.<p>But most of the time, it&#x27;s click -> own.<p>The other thing that prevents useful quantification is that we don&#x27;t have a Gaussian distribution to be seen. Rate of discovery, maybe, but that&#x27;s it. We do not have Gaussian distribution on size of protected items, density of vulnerabilities, or anything else. Without that most of our good risk estimation techniques don&#x27;t produce numbers that mean much to managers.<p>This is, IMHO, the fundamental reason why infosec doesn&#x27;t get listened to. Our management structures are still highly Gaussian-biased (decades of manufacturing envy). They can&#x27;t even wrap their head around software engineering schedules and costs after several decades, and infosec risks have <i>even worse</i> distributions! It is, in my very strong and considered opinion, <i>perfectly rational</i> for infosec to be vigorously ringing the bell. Consider exactly the bug we&#x27;re talking about now... it&#x27;s a vulnerability that has the potential to <i>destroy the auto industry</i>, were it properly exploited. (It would not just by Chrysler caught in the crossfire! And my use of present tense is considered. I have little reason to believe this is fixed, nor that it is the only such bug.) Our risk management procedures can not even properly express the idea that an engineer drawing a line between two nodes in the car&#x27;s communications bus could have that result, can not properly express the Black Swan nature of that decision. But that&#x27;s not infosec&#x27;s fault, or at least, not infosec&#x27;s fault alone.<p>And it&#x27;s certainly not a solution for infosec to get more realistic about risk, because &quot;more realistic about risk&quot; probably means we ought to be a good factor of magnitude or so <i>more</i> strident, not less! The more I learn about the risks in this world the more horrifying it gets, and it&#x27;s getting <i>worse</i>, not better, as things get more interconnected. Again, look at this car bug... it&#x27;s something that could not possibly have existed 20 years ago. None of us, from CEO to engineer to QA, have even begun to properly process what this means, let alone react to it! And we won&#x27;t until the Black Swan bites <i>and probably not even then!</i>",1437839760
9947927,comment,9946374,9946374,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"The title is a half-truth: commercial software is certainly in the decline while also being a huge, profitable business. The SaaS and ad-driven vendors get most of the attention. They might even be most of the startups. Yet, there&#x27;s a steady stream of companies building software that&#x27;s worth paying for and making money on it. On top of that, there&#x27;s always the &quot;improve legacy systems&quot; market where you makes something they can&#x27;t get away from even better. Solutions building on Microsoft, Oracle, mainframe, AS/400, VMS, and so on all come to mind. They stay around, so your enhancement might stay around too.<p>The two ensure commercial software won&#x27;t go away or even be marginal in terms of where the profit is. SaaS is a race-to-the-bottom due to intense competitiveness. Ad-driven model can be lucrative but is also high risk. Building a product with strong lock-in effects is the only method proven to last decades. From there, you can decide whether you want the risk of the ad model (Facebook) or the profit of commercial model (Microsoft, Oracle). One looks more appealing. ;)",1437839758

There is a salient difference between JSTOR and LofB, namely, that JSTOR keys are all much shorter than the works they summon.  JSTOR works thus have more information content than their keys.  This is a consequence of the fact that JSTOR only contains a tiny subset of all possible works.<p>To get a work out of LofB I have to actually generate all of the information content of that work in order to produce the key.  LofB keys are, on average, the same length as the works.  So I have to do <i>more</i> work to get something out of LofB than I do to get something out of JSTOR.  In fact, I have to do all of the work.  So it is not true that LofB works are &quot;just as available&quot; as JSTOR works.<p>LofB is like the parent who responds to a child&#x27;s request for a bedtime story by asking the child to describe in every detail the story they want to hear and then parroting that back to them.

In 2007 that hole was just $1.35 trillion. In 2014 alone the U.S. position worsened by $1.7 trillion.<p>-$1.2 trillion of this was due to exchange rates: other countries are running their printing presses faster than the U.S. is, so it is losing the competitive currency debasement race kicked off in 2008. This is not news, but it makes this number <i>worse</i> because it causes U.S. assets held by foreigners to appreciate faster relative to foreign assets held by U.S. citizens.<p>Price changes contributed another -$0.35 trillion. That is, even in local currencies, U.S. investments made by foreigners had a better return than foreign investments held by U.S. citizens.<p>Then all the way down at -$0.24 trillion was &quot;net financial transactions&quot;, or the trade deficit, which is the thing Buffett&#x27;s IC proposal would actually be able to control.<p>In other words, unless I have misunderstood something, balancing the trade deficit, or even running a substantial surplus is not going to solve these problems at the rate they are going.

There have been a number of underwater habitats built (both for science and nominally living quarters) so there are reports you can read on the experience.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to talk about it as if it were a commonplace thing, but compared to settlements on other worlds, it is. I&#x27;m not sure what the state of the art is, though as I recall the navy had some habitats in the 70&#x27;s that they stopped reporting on, so either they closed them down or there&#x27;s some secret underwater laboratory Deus Ex-style somewhere.<p>>In particular a &#x27;huge asteroid&#x27; could not be mitigated by &quot;diving into a trench&quot;, water is incompressible by nature and the impact of an asteroid in the ocean would cause a huge over-pressure event in your habitats, where ever they are, resulting in their destruction. Today, such an impact would destroy every submarine in the same ocean where it hit.<p>Well, yes, that is true for submarines. But an undersea settlement would most likely be anchored to the ocean floor and have access to it, mostly for mining, geomethermal power and storage, but you could use it as a shelter in case the main habitat is destroyed.<p>>Gamma rays would be fine, water does make an excellent radiation blocker. That could be achieved on land by building a structure that was inside the middle of a water reservoir.

As I&#x27;ve begun to study furiously, I also have found an intense passion in programming.<p>I study 2-3 hours after work every day and roughly 7+ hours weekends to be able to make the switch into a software engineering opportunity, and have networked to find a job in San Francisco.

The government pays dividends out of the profits of property taxes. New construction increases property taxes, since new high rises pay a lot more tax than old row homes or vacant blocks. Thus, the owner-shareholder will also gain money from new construction. Conceivably, the city could charge a supplementary &quot;new construction&quot; tax to make the numbers balance out so that home owners would always net gain from new construction.

Today, such an impact would destroy every submarine in the same ocean where it hit.<p>Gamma rays would be fine, water does make an excellent radiation blocker. That could be achieved on land by building a structure that was inside the middle of a water reservoir. (imagine a large water storage tank with underwater living space in the middle of it.)",1437836753

I know 1.10 could lag my computer but 1.12 is very fast and snappy. Also in my experience, playing 1.12, the game state almost never gets out of sync. If it happens it is because one or more players have different version of some add-ons. So yeah, you really should try 1.12 or even checkout and play the version from their repo because it has even more improvements to it.",1437836682

9947754,comment,9943069,9943069,0,0,gaelow,,,"Beware of the long post ahead:<p>Mine is a very common and uninteresting story. It is not even a cautionary tale, but I&#x27;ll write it anyway to remind myself of the choices that I made and why I made them, because I think it will help me and because maybe it will help somebody else.<p>I used to drink when I partied with my friends, mostly on weekends and vacations. I kept it like this for almost 12 years.<p>5 years ago I started living with my girlfriend and drinking frequently with her and when we met our relatives; then I started to drink alone from time to time when my girlfriend was not around; then I started to get drunk every night because it helped me unwind, numb myself, forget about all my problems, release stress and fall asleep after 11-12 straight hours in front of the screen trying to meet deadlines. I had perfectly adjusted the amount of alcohol that wouldn&#x27;t get me hung over or impact my performance the next day at work so I wouldn&#x27;t get in trouble, and wouldn&#x27;t drink a drop less nor a drop more. I even managed to stuck to that amount most weekends in order to avoid building up tolerance, and because I hated wasting my free time suffering from hang overs. I went like this for more than a year. Then I broke up with my 5-year girlfriend after a few months of maintaining a long distance relationship and realizing our life goals were not compatible any more.<p>I decided to stop drinking because I knew without her I&#x27;d soon find myself overdoing it (even more). I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to be an easy choice to maintain, feeling depressed most of the time and still feeling at the lowest point of my life so far with not much hope of it getting much better; but, surprisingly, feeling bad about myself has been very helpful: I got drunk with about half a bottle of wine 5 times in the last 3 months (I am a little guy), only 3 of those alone, and that was all the drinking I have done since.<p>I do not believe in a higher power, self labeling yourself an alcoholic and get a chronic disease diagnose from anything other than a doctor, a specialized one, with enough data to produce an informed diagnostic. I don&#x27;t think I can talk or think myself out of alcoholism; only action and persistence can help. I find motivation in all the things I love to do and in all the people I love and I love spending my time with. I even find motivation in my dull work because I have plenty of room and opportunity to improve and get better conditions.<p>I respect the 12 step program and its effectiveness as a generic solution for a significant number of people dealing with addiction. It is probably the best there is right now, but it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, not even the majority of people. I think I have a basic understanding on how addiction works and how it works differently on different kinds of people. I knew that I was in a very dangerous track of self destruction and I decided not to let the situation escalate any more when I was still in control. It took no effort at all, just the proper motivation and realizing I was only going to find misery and self hatred at the end of that road. I know I may find myself in the same situation again, and that I might not be able to get out so easily next time, if there is one. I do enjoy drinking, and I enjoy drinking alone to take the edge off; but right now I feel pretty confident about my self-discipline, and there are enough safe ways to find the comfort and relaxation I need that work for me. Healthy and non dangerous ways that make me feel better about myself instead of the opposite. I do believe in moderation and a reasonable amount of self control, and I am committed to drink even less than what I am drinking now. Like I wrote, mine is a very common story that I hope will have a common ending too, but a good one: &quot;And he kept the drinking social and moderated, and never again used it as a crouch&quot;. Or, perhaps: &quot;And he stopped drinking, and nobody batted an eye&quot;.<p>TL;DR: The drinking is not the problem, is the addiction you need to avoid. Even if you are not an addict or are in the first stages towards heavy addiction, drinking is easily replaceable with many things that can improve your life and how you feel about yourself. Do not procrastinate that decision. It is not tomorrow. It is not after the next drink, or this one. It is now. Keeping the drinking social and with moderation or not doing it at all, combined with a slight effort to find healthier enjoyable activities to occupy yourself with is a very good thing to do for yourself and to give as a present to your future self for enduring the consequences of all the mistakes you are going to keep making.<p>And that&#x27;s my story, at least up to this point. I haven&#x27;t talked to anybody about it, I know it is a drag to read or hear people talking about boring stuff like this. But still, it feels good to let it out in the open.",1437836610

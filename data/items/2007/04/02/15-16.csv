Not for ISP which seems facile, but for a network alternative to WiFi/Telco and Cable.<p>I actually think it is futuristic. Those millions of miles of readily available ""cables"" in every country with plumbing. Actually I am REALLY EXCITED even though the idea flows with sh1t (yuck!).<p>Have people experimented with bots to crawl the sewers?<p>Just think of it. Suppose it turns out that the wireless router in my home, and the local cell phone tower is irradiating my DNA and harming it. Then an idea like this coupled with advances in nanotechnology will really take off.<p>\nYou could even transport food through this pipeline!\n:D<p>-\nAnil Philip",1175529401

8230,comment,7253,7457,0,0,andyjenn,,,"Thats a great idea!\nMy wife and I discussed my reasons for starting a startup and she is being very supportive from the outset, but sometimes gets frustrated that I don't ""communicate my feelings"" very well. She hardly sees me and doesn't have a clue about computers whereas I'm excited, stressed, anxious, and so focused on technical things for 12 hours a day, I sometimes struggle with the ""How was your day darling?"" type conversation in the evening. \nWithout sounding trite, communication is vital in a marriage so working on a startup shouldn't be different to any other important decision you make.\nI'll take this involvment on board - thanks a lot...",1175529387

8226,comment,8123,8123,0,0,cwilbur,,,"I couldn't think of anything that didn't sound trite when I first filled out the form, so I left it blank and decided to come back to it later.<p>(As far as I'm concerned it's a long shot.  I don't think my idea and my goals for my business line up that well with what YC is really looking for, based on what they've done in the past.  So I filled out the form more for myself than for them.) <p>But then I thought of the best answer to that question -- the most personally meaningful thing I've discovered, something that I don't think anyone else has ever noticed -- over the weekend, and only realized this morning that the deadline had whooshed right by while I was sleeping.<p>Oops.  \n",1175528302

8222,comment,8220,8220,0,0,jmtame,,,"I'm not sure how equity works if I have a co-founder and I'm giving him ""15%.""  Is this in stock?  Or is this annual revenues?  Or am I the one who decides?  What's typical?<p>I'm not studying finance at college right now, so keep that in mind.  Any sites that might explain this would be helpful.  Thanks",1175526882

You gotta admit when you're beat, pg.<p>Next you'll be saying founders' primary concern is whether the startup will survive, when the reality is that equity allocation is their primary concern.

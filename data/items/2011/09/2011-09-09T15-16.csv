Because there is no defined plan, one is set by example.  They look to you and to their peers.  I suspect strongly that you will take less vacation than them being the CEO of the company. I also suspect that their peers will gravitate toward taking less vacation, and human guilt will be the guide.<p>I urge you to reconsider.  Instead give them a very generous vacation policy (20 days! a whole month!) and then MAKE THEM TAKE IT!

2978530,comment,2978027,2978345,8,0,anatoly,,,"I only read Dune last year (I'm in my thirties), and really disliked it. Your comment, however, emphasizes a virtue I did not sufficiently acknowledge at the time. It _is_ true that Dune was able to weave a lot of background into the story without resorting to technical infodumps. And at the time it was a rare and impressive achievement in SF, deserving of praise. But I don't think I'd agree that things haven't changed since; nowadays careful weaving of background isn't rare. The first two examples that pop into my mind are Banks' books (the Culture series or _Fearsum Enjinn_) in SF and Martin's _A Song of Ice and Fire_ novels in fantasy. It may be reasonable to say, however, that Dune has been foundational in teaching later authors the necessity of doing this.<p>(Ultimately, I just couldn't handle how bad the writing was. All the characters are utterly cardboard flat. Cliched tags follow them around the book. One character has an inkvine scar on his jaw that eventually ripples in any scene he's in... and then again in the next scene... and again... I felt like instituting a drinking game based on the rippling of the scar. The main hero's mind is filled with a _terrible purpose_ whenever the author feels the need to emphasize a clue or a plot point. And the author just can't handle the flow of information (who knows what how, and whether the reader also knows that and how). This leads to the I'm-going-to-spell-out-precisely-what-I'm-about-to-do syndrome you mention, but goes deeper than that, creating plot holes and distortions, and causing most of the characters to learn most of the important knowledge they need basically by staring into space and having a revelation).",1315582972

Of always having a network connection to docs, no.  Maybe its just the environments I've been in, but at every client, employer, or place I've visited, my devices were more reliable than the network connection.  Hell, last year the level 3 uplink for most of my state was out for a day.<p>In both cases you need a working computer to edit a file, but only one of them also requires a network connection.  The only advantages you have are that software deploys faster because you're using a 21-centurly terminal emulator and the file under work is stored on the network.<p>Just because we as developers haven't put the solutions to quick and easy deployment of software packages and file redundancy into the hands of users doesn't make the cloud a panacea.  We have these tools for us already.  If my desktop fails, my latest-version files were on its hard drive, the network drive and usb flash drive, all synced after every save. I can grab a laptop or my co-workers machine and in the time it takes me to plug in a flash drive or just hit up a lan repository I'll have the files as they were at time of failure.  If the other computer doesn't have the software, if I could hit up google docs on the other machine, I can easily smack 1 command into the terminal and in 30 seconds be ready to roll (and that server could be local, too, not relying on internet uplink). I'm not against relying on the network at all, but doing so in a manner that doesn't demand an always-on connection to get work done.<p>A solution that relies on the availability of network <i>OR</i> local machine and can gracefully handle the fault of one or the other is orders of magnitude more reliable than a solution that relies on <i>BOTH</i> network and local machine.",1315582630

But some may be asking whether I personally was all that important in the company's history.  I can't judge that.  All I know for sure is that I put my heart and soul into it especially during the first half of my time there, and I still feel a strong connection to the place (despite having left almost 12 years ago) even when they really get me angry, like with this sales tax thing.  I'd prefer not to have to have a personal reaction to things like that, but there you are.  As is pointed out elsewhere, Bezos was the only one who was really making strategic decisions, and it's probably still that way for all I know, though I participated in some.  The idea to do a bookstore was his, though we were not the first on the web to do that. That doesn't mean I (and other early ""participants"") didn't have our own visions of where things ought to go too.  When you do the engineering, hacking, and tech operations side of a startup, going from nothing to something, it's like it grows out of you and it feels like an extension of you.  That's a different relationship from being the person with the idea who does the fund-raising and makes the big decisions.  You need to have both.<p>At one point I'd say the company's ""DNA"" probably was influenced by me to an extent, but I've been gone for a long time, and it was tiny compared to its current size when I left, so it would be pretty surprising if any of that is still there.

Inevitably they're dominated by books that were, in their time, incredibly significant.<p>You see the same things in computing books. Someone will always recommend ""Design Patterns"" but (IMHO) it is the dullest, driest book you could ever read. The <i>ideas</i> were important. As a book it's terrible.<p>Science fiction falls into a number of categories.<p>The first is space opera. This is basically a tale of adventure in a science fiction environment. Sometimes these books have some kind of message but most of the time they don't. They're typically the ""Terminator 2"" of books: they can be hugely entertaining, sometimes even really significant, but often don't have much substance.<p>Don't take that as a criticism. Stephen Donaldson's ""Gap"" series was, for me, a fantastic series but it really is simply space opera style entertainment.<p>The second is what I call ""hard science fiction"". It's the sort of sci-fi where the story is a backdrop for some physics. Ringworld is an example of this (as are most of Niven's works).<p>This is a genre I thought largely dead (with its height in the 60s and 70s) until I read Alastair Reynolds. His books have more of a story than, say, Niven's but they're still largely rooted in our current understanding of physics.<p>The third is what I call ""literary science fiction"". Literature, traditionally, was used as a means of talking about something that normally couldn't be talked about. Plays in the Shakespeare's time filled this role. Nowadays it's not so much that talking about these things is verboten, it's that the story can be an accessible way of discussing a topic that an essay never could.<p>Stranger in a Strange Land is very much in this category. It's almost only sci-fi by association. It does have the hallmarks of its age, most notably mental powers (a common zeitgeist in 60s sci-fi). This book probably had the same effect on society that, say, Pacific cultures did on Victorian English society.<p>In the 80s cyberpunk was born. Cyberpunk is largely an expression of fears about an Asian (Japanese more often than not) ""takeover"" of Western society. It's actually very xenophobic but it does reflect the dystopian fears of the time. Cyberpunk has waned in recent years as the xenophobia has and the realization that this isn't the future.<p>Does this make pioneering books in this field like Neuromancer ""good""? Personally I thought that if you ignore the pioneering part, it was a fairly average book. Here again is the power of nostalgia I think (as I read it some years after it came out).<p>So I find many books on this list that are (IMHO) overrated, largely for nostalgic reasons.<p>I also find some authors missing that really should be represented, most notably the prolific CJ Cheeryh whose books Downbelow Station and Cyteen are both noteworthy and stand the test of time.<p>Some books on this list stand the test of time very well. Ender's Game, any of the Iain M. Banks' Culture novels, Hyperion to name a few.",1315581047

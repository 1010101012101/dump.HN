Google loves those, and loves heroic performances from people in war-rooms)""<p>The whole ""war room"" concept in IT has always bothered me -- it's what managers do when they have a crisis that they don't know how to deal with. It's usually a crisis that they could have avoided if they'd actually done their own job in the first place. War rooms are also invariably where the worst of the developers end up -- at Disney the war room period was one of our most product weeks as a result. Of course, the folks who got rewarded were the ones in the war room, even though their primary contribution was to strut around in front of a bunch of executives while the rest of the team got project work done and the operations team had already figured out what went wrong.",1280779164

Biological data is often incomplete, fields can be missing, or a field that is expected to be present once occurs several times (because, for example, an experiment was run in duplicate), or the data was entered by hand and doesn't quite fit the expected format. Perl doesn't particularly mind if a value is empty or contains odd characters. Regular expressions can be written to pick up and correct a variety of common errors in data entry. Of course this flexibility can be also be a curse.",1280779163

For instance, I think women would be much more willing to buy undergarments from women than (especially, unattractive) men.  There are definitely people with a preference about the sex of their doctor.  There are lots of documented studies about attractive people being more successful in management and sales, so especially if the hire is viewed as a long-term career move, hiring an unattractive person might be objectively inferior.<p>There are specific, legal, questions you could ask which would be ok (""how many years of experience do you have with bras?"", various technical questions, etc.) which might correlate highly with certain physical characteristics.<p>I think there is a moral argument against discrimination on these grounds, but there's also an argument for letting companies make their own decisions.<p>Even without legal prohibitions on discrimination, I wouldn't want to create a workplace where this kind of discrimination happened -- even if it were good for a specific job, it would also drive away other candidates for other jobs, and I think the net loss would be greater.",1280778869

Frankly if you have a webpage, and you can articulate your product's value to customers in a simple way - you have already done half of marketing's job at a small company.<p>Marketing feeds sales leads, and sales is responsible changing the order of those letters from ""leads"" into ""deals"".<p>A salesperson without marketing needs to be able to clearly articulate your value prop, AND find new leads.  This is a special person.<p>Another way to approach this question:  Do your prospects already ""get"" your product, and are calling you asking for demos or more info?  Or, do you need to spend the first 15 minutes of a call explaining to prospects what it is you do and why they need your product?<p>If it is the former - hire a sales-minded person.  The hard part about sales is CLOSING.  good sales people are always closing deals, and getting the money out of a customer's hands (in a good way). I find most marketer's are NOT good at closing. As long as your sales person has some leads flowing in from your site, and can figure out who is a good fit for him to hassle that turn into deals - you'll be good.<p>If your product is ill defined, and you need to explain it in detail or talk to engineers who ""get it"" before anything is ever sold, then go with someone who has a marketing mind first.  Their first task is to get a very solid product story that gets people interested in your product (even if they are not an engineer).  If you have a good product story, sales becomes much easier to close and will build your pipeline of deals.  then you can get a sales person who is focused on closing those new deals.<p>Marketing and Sales should be aligned....but not run by the same person if possible.",1280778148

Further, the security needs in those meters is high. I say this from a consumer protection and a grid protection point of view (as in part of a larger defense in depth framework). And, the meters should be as secure as possible from general principle too.<p>However, my point is that the doom-and-gloom type scenarios, of ""OMG the meters are insecure, now they own the power grid"" is not realistic. There are other systems on other networks that can isolate and/or shut down places that have misbehaving meters. This is a result of grid operators being very paranoid about malfunction -- and at the level you are talking about, this looks to the grid like a malfunction. There are billions of dollars of infrastructure to protect, and from that point of view, they have already made some good moves from security standpoint -- a coordinated effort on many levels is required to get the grid to a failure state.<p>Again, I agree that security must be part of the entire process, however there is the other, equally valid point, which says ""at some point, there will be always cheaters, and as a result this must be dealt with in a cost/benefit context"".  In many ways it could be cheaper to go with a fairly insecure smart-meter and just look for evidence of tampering with statistical comparisons and the occasional man in the field to look for physical evidence of tampering. I think this is particularly notable, as there is no good way to prevent people from getting physical access (security kiss of death) to the meters anyway.",1280777329

Even if that works, you still haven't fixed the root problem, that you lack the internal motivation to pursue your goals.  The best you can do under this system is to jump from one external motivator to the other.<p>To develop internal motivation, force yourself to work on your projects a little bit each day.  You're not going to go from zero hours to five hours a day in the space of a week.  Internal motivation is like a muscle you have to develop over long periods of time.  Resign yourself to the fact that you don't have the discipline to live up to your expectations right now, but eventually you will if you push yourself a tiny bit more each day.  As Epictetus once said, nothing great is produced suddenly.<p>To actually answer your question, no you shouldn't go for a PhD, since it's not an external motivator, it's an anti-motivator.

What you label it with isn't anywhere near as important as what it <i>does</i>.<p>In practice, these ""nations"" appear to be nothing more than special interest groups. Special interest groups already tend to expand well beyond their original goals in the political arena. That doesn't work because the active leadership takes over and speaks for the public; why these would avoid that, I don't know. So, the solution to too many special interest groups is more special interest groups.<p>Also, I think he uses ""Tea Party"" like bogeymen. To the extent the movement involves cutting government down, it will actually increase the scope of agreement within the government by cutting down the number of domains in which there is disagreement. In fact, my personal prescription for where we are right now is for a significant return of power to the states. Some things have to be national-scale policy, but the list is much shorter than you think. We don't need a national-scale health care plan. Many of our states are larger than European countries that manage. State plans already exist. We don't need national agreement on any given social issue. If we weren't centralizing all our power, we wouldn't have to spend so much time arguing what the central policy should be.<p>The other major problem these sort of idealistic ideas have is that it basically promises everybody that it will bring the world closer to their viewpoint, but that can't actually happen. Right now, for better or worse, our government is more liberal than our population, so if your plan is to push our government yet more liberal by empowering the population, err, well, you might want to rethink that plan.",1280777083

I would personally try to emulate the traditional phone interview, optionally with video -- start off with some chitchat and background on the company to get candidates comfortable, and then ask questions which demand immediate and realtime, unrehearsed responses.<p>You have the chance of making the process more efficient, especially when there are hundreds or thousands of applicants.  Maybe use a video pitch by the interviewer, clip about the company, etc. to set the setting and make the candidate comfortable, and then do instant-response questions with video response.<p>I might also start the interview with some super-softball questions, to get the user familiar with the system.  ""What's your name?"" isn't really good, but some really easy tech questions or even general knowledge questions might be good.<p>The main benefits to me in having a bunch of recorded interviews is that I can instantly drop one if the candidate is obviously a reject.  It took me a few years of hiring responsibility before I got to the point of ""I'm sorry, I have to end this now"" if someone is obviously unacceptable 5-10 minutes in.  A problem with doing that in real life is that you need to block out the whole interview on your schedule, and it's harder to fit other things back in once that is freed.<p>Being able to outsource reviewing answers to other people in your organization would also be great -- e.g. sending the database question to your database guys.  If you are really interviewing 1k people, you can have your database guy look at 10, grade those, and then have a junior person, based on those, grade any which pattern-match well, and refer the others back to the expert.<p>I'd still prefer a written or executable test for most technical jobs, at least as my initial screen, and an IM or phone chat, but I could see the value of this for some roles.",1280776893

1568646,comment,1568089,1568089,0,0,TheEzEzz,,,"My two cents (take with salt, as I'm a math Phd student, not CS):<p>A grad program absolutely CAN motivate you, IF you are motivated by failure and feelings of inadequacy. In math there is a real divide between being book smart and being able to do research (to put it mildly, it's more like a chasm). Most students have been validated their whole lives by being better than the rest, and finally coming to an obstacle that doesn't yield can be life changing.<p>For me, my self identity was absolutely tied up in proving myself as a mathematician, and my first few years of research were HELL. Total self sacrifice, total commitment. I came out the other side of the blaze a new person, and better for it, I think. I've lost the desire to do math, but I've gained the self confidence and mental integrity to disappear into a cave for years to work on a project with no sense of validation from others.<p>There were other motivating factors: wanting to compete with other students, wanting to impress my advisor, etc. NONE of those motivations survived the pain of research. And, to be honest, now that I've proven myself, not even that desire exists anymore. As of now, I can't fathom doing a PhD again. The only thing that can motivate me now is working on a really interesting problem, and to be honest academia ISN'T necessarily the place for this. At least in math, there really isn't that much freedom in what you can research.<p>If you can find a good research project that involves enough people to keep you motivated from social pressure, I say go for it, as it sounds like you're really jonesing for interesting work and simply need the motivational factor. Otherwise, if you can find some other way to stay motivated, I'd say do research on your own.<p>(As a side note, I have a Mech Eng friend that just got his PhD. He released much of his research as an open source library which apparently has attracted a pretty substantial user/contributor group. So it is possible to write quality code in an academic setting, especially if you've already have commercial experience and a desire to hold yourself to that level. Most academics have simply never been in a position where they Needed to write commercial quality code).",1280775976

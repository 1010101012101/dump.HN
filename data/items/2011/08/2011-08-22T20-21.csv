Most CMS sites do.<p>There is a very compelling reason to run a dynamic site: for most software businesses, that site is the primary venue for all your ""marketing engineering"", including SEO, A/B testing, interactivity, &c.<p>The companies that have this dilemma generally have already excepted the architecture of ""public site that is separate from their actual application site"", which is a step in the direction of mitigating the impact of the security risk.<p>Those companies would mitigate the impact even further by hosting the public site in a different data center from their application.<p>Generally speaking, between ""adequately secure CMS site"" and ""adequately engineered marketing processes"", and speaking as a security person with a vested interest in selling everyone on buttoning down security everywhere as much as possible: most startups are doing more damage to themselves by not maximizing marketing engineering than they are by exposing themselves to attack.<p>I'd suggest a middle ground: designate some large, important swath of your public site as sacred and make it static. Host it with stripped down vanilla Apache or Nginx. Then, where you benefit from dynamicism, expose another resource (like a small EC2 server) in your URL space to implement it. This sounds complicated but is really very easy and gives you some of the benefit of a static site (attacks won't tear down your front page) and all the benefits of a dynamic site.<p>A rule of thumb, by the way: if you sell a web app on the public Internet, and you haven't done something to have that web app formally assessed for security flaws, running a static brochure site for its security benefits is a premature optimization.",1314046787

I know it's potentially inconvenient to do so, but it makes the pricing a little silly. I could also host the same video multiple times, and have a rand() select between them, or select the ones that have been selected the least in order to redistribute bandwidth.<p>It's kind of like on some McDonald's menus, where an Apple Pie is $0.69, or you can buy 2 for $1.39.<p>Edit: I'm going to email your sales with the FYI.",1314046557

2914076,comment,2911930,2913593,2,0,thequux,,,"Eclipse is not fundamentally less productive than vim; it's just productive along a different axis. Eclipse can sling around Java syntax like no other, but it's no better than notepad at editing text. On the other hand, vim has a very cursory understanding of Java syntax (as in, it knows that ""for"" is a keyword and ""{"" starts an indented block; i.e., just what is necessary for syntax highlighting and indenting). As a result, eclipse is really good at moving around your source, which is important when editing large software.<p>Vim, on the other hand, is more of a tactical editor; it lets you compose a small set of primitives into a incantation that will rearrange arguments in a function call, and then compose that with the repetition primitives to do basic refactoring. The effect is the same, but the way you go about it is very different.",1314046509

  * reduce overhead of switching between projects.

There have been a few times that I have found a flight only to click through to another online flight aggregator (orbitz etc) to find they don't have the rates specified on hipmunk. Very frustrating.<p>2. I hate, hate, hate dealing with other aggregators (again..orbitz etc). I don't know if they do this already or it is in their long-term plan, but Hipmunk would benefit from working directly with Airline companies. Apologies if they already do this and I didn't see it.<p>3. This is less of a problem and more of a request: rental cars! Please do for rental car search what you did for flight search. It took me hours to find a car to rent after searching through the usual suspect's websites (hertz, budget, avis). Their websites are beyond terrible. For example, I went to select the pickup location for a rental car (on Budget) and when I clicked the location, the page reloaded with zero error feedback. I assume there was a problem with my selection but how was I suppose to know what it is? I clicked all the options and it just kept reloading the page. Terrible.<p>Hipmunk is a great product tackling a hard problem. However, they have a lot of work to do. I will continue to use them and hopefully they will continue to improve.

That's not always readable, but at least if you see some funny symbols, you know that you have to look it up.<p>With Haskell's typeclasses (and I guess Ocaml's Functors should allow the same) you can have the functions of the same name that work differently for different types.  E.g. there's a Show-typeclass, whose instances have to provide a `show :: a -> String' function.  The Num-typeclass includes operators such as `(+) :: a -> a -> a', which means that + always takes to arguments of the same type and returns the same.

For example, I dont always use plain strings for things like SSNs/SINs and phone numbers, sometimes I create a brand new class.<p>You can do this in any language today by boxing strings. In an untyped language like Ruby, youll get runtime errors if you try to use an UnsafeString where you expect a String, and in a statically typed language youll get a compiler error.<p>Some languages make this easier than others, but the main problem is not whether you can use types or boxes to solve the problem. The main problem is that if you are using libraries/frameworks that doesnt support your types or boxes, you still have to be careful to place boxing and unboxing code where your code interacts with the library.<p>Taking a web framework as an example, if its template system expects PUS (plain unsafe strings) and it provides post parameters as PUS, its up to you to box things up so that your code never passes PUS straight through the system. I agree that once you box up a PUS it wont get inserted into a template, but the pain point is that library authors dont implement anything like this so you are going to have to deal with the rather broad interface between your code and almost every library that does something with a string.<p>Which is not to say that types are or are not better than coding conventions, but rather to say that in theory types are an airtight solution in any language, but in practice there is still broad scope for human error thanks to libraries.",1314044556

As a GUI editor user and generally vi(m) ignorant person I have a question about that. Flaky connections - that's where I live. Right now my typical MO is to open an SFTP connection to a remote dev server and edit the files on it by using an SFTP-capable editor. Essentially, the editor pulls the file, displays it for modification, and commits it back to the server when I press CMD-S. This works so incredibly well because the editing phase itself has no latency and saving 2-3 kB of (compressed) source doesn't take longer than a few seconds over the worst of connections.<p>Now, does vi(m) have a similar feature or did you mean (as I expect you did) that editing over a terminal connection to a vi instance that runs on the actual server was surprisingly effective? Because if you did mean that, you haven't seen actual bad connections yet ;-)<p>Don't get me wrong, I always have a Terminal window open, I love the command line.

How shall we look for it? ALS is a rare disease. There are 5600 new cases of ALS in the USA every year, out of 307 million Americans. This implies, very roughly speaking, that in a study group of 50,000 people, one person will get diagnosed with ALS every year on average. So doing a prospective study of ALS patients is going to be astonishingly expensive: You'll need to sign up hundreds of thousands of subjects, then follow them for years, to get any meaningful number of actual cases among your study participants.<p>The alternative is to carefully quiz ALS patients and their families after diagnosis and see if they all tend to report similar, distinct, unusual patterns in their earlier lifestyles. But self-reporting is a lousy way to look for subtle effects, especially when the sample size is necessarily small. People have spent decades trying to positively identify environmental triggers for much more common conditions, often with little result.<p>So if we must identify and eliminate an environmental factor before we can reduce the incidence of ALS, we probably won't reduce the incidence of ALS anytime soon. Trying to improve or extend the lives of ALS patients post-diagnosis is, perhaps, a more tractable strategy. We know exactly who to run the tests on.

The real problem is that many claimed environmental/diet factors turn out to be statistical noise or complete bullshit when examined further.""<p>No doubt this is true, especially in the case of meat and saturated fat.  Usually this is the result of bad science, typically drawing cause and effect conclusions from epidemiological evidence (See Denise Minger's critique of The China Study here:  <a href=""http://rawfoodsos.com/2010/07/07/the-china-study-fact-or-fallac/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rawfoodsos.com/2010/07/07/the-china-study-fact-or-fal...</a>).<p>The problem with ""interrupting the process"" is that we still don't know much about the functioning of many (perhaps most) physiological processes.  Disrupting the body's natural processes in one area can cause problems of equal or greater significance in other areas.<p>Also, studies proving the safety and effectiveness of drugs are, more often than not, highly flawed.  Studies frequently exaggerate the improvements seen, fail to show that improvements are due to drugs, or are repeated until the results they are looking for are achieved.<p>For an excellent review of the flaws of medical research see Lies, Damned Lies, and Medical Science here:  <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-damned-lies-and-medical-science/8269/?single_page=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/lies-dam...</a>)  Here are but a few highlights:<p>""...much of what biomedical researchers conclude in published studiesconclusions that doctors keep in mind when they prescribe antibiotics or blood-pressure medication, or when they advise us to consume more fiber or less meat, or when they recommend surgery for heart disease or back painis misleading, exaggerated, and often flat-out wrong. He charges that as much as 90 percent of the published medical information that doctors rely on is flawed.""<p>""researchers were frequently manipulating data analyses, chasing career-advancing findings rather than good science, and even using the peer-review processin which journals ask researchers to help decide which studies to publishto suppress opposing views.""<p>""even if a study managed to highlight a genuine health connection to some nutrient, youre unlikely to benefit much from taking more of it, because we consume thousands of nutrients that act together as a sort of network, and changing intake of just one of them is bound to cause ripples throughout the network that are far too complex for these studies to detect, and that may be as likely to harm you as help you.""<p>""Even if changing that one factor does bring on the claimed improvement, theres still a good chance that it wont do you much good in the long run, because these studies rarely go on long enough to track the decades-long course of disease and ultimately death. Instead, they track easily measurable health markers such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood-sugar levels, and meta-experts have shown that changes in these markers often dont correlate as well with long-term health as we have been led to believe.""<p>""The tests could turn up something, but theyre probably irrelevant. Just having a good talk with the patient and getting a close history is much more likely to tell me whats wrong. Of course, the doctors have all been trained to order these tests, she notes, and doing so is a lot quicker than a long bedside chat. Theyre also trained to ply the patient with whatever drugs might help whack any errant test numbers back into line. What theyre not trained to do is to go back and look at the research papers that helped make these drugs the standard of care. When you look the papers up, you often find the drugs didnt even work better than a placebo.""<p>I suppose I've strayed too far from the original topic, but I think I've made my point.",1314043210

1663473,comment,1663381,1663381,0,0,marknutter,,,"Here's my take on testing:<p>I'm the kind of guy who likes to get things working as fast as possible.  When I'm excited about an app or feature idea, I can't be bothered with writing tests along the way, much less <i>before</i> I write my code.  I get much more satisfaction out of writing code, running it in the browser, and testing it the old fashioned way.  I build apps and features <i>quickly</i> and this usually makes me (or the client I'm building it for) very happy in the process.<p>I do, however, understand the value of testing.  Unlike the OP I <i>have</i> seen real world cases where testing has been a godsend. I often feel guilty for not writing tests, even if it's just a toy app I'm developing for my own curiosity.<p>To balance these opposing tendencies of mine, I have taken a ATDD approach to testing, or ""Adaptive Test Driven Development"". That is, write tests for the most critical components of the site, such as anything dealing with money or sensitive information, and write tests for the parts of the app that get used the most, both by me when I'm developing them, and the users once it's deployed.<p>When I've gone to the browser for the 5th time to test a feature I'm developing, it's a pretty good sign that an automated test would be more efficient than my manual testing, so I set aside the time to write it. If I know there's a part of the app that errors will be completely detrimental to, I will write tests for that, if only for my own psyche.<p>To be completely honest, TDD/BDD and some of the rhetoric surrounding it seems a bit ivory-towerish - a way for the templars of hacking to distinguish themselves from the proletariat developers. If I had been told TDD is the only way I could develop a rails app when I first started doing it I probably would have given up pretty early on.  So if TDD is getting in the way of your being productive, it kind of defeats the purpose of it even existing.<p>The important thing is to strike a balance that works for you, and keep an open mind about other developer's habits and tendencies.",1283637142
1663472,comment,1663381,1663431,0,0,kenjackson,,,"The issue isn't about testing, it's about unit testing.  And really more specifically about BDD/TDD.<p>And I must admit that I've struggled with TDD myself.  And I've generally hit a couple of issues:<p>1) Bug rates in test code for some reason seem to be higher than that in production code.  Not sure why.  But the end result is a LOT more test bugs than product bugs.  I've sat in meetings where people wanted to block shipping the product because of test bugs.  No evidence there were any blocking issues in production code.<p>2) The opportunity cost of TDD style unit tests are rather high.  Given the choice I think I'd rather a more in-depth design and code review.<p>While I think unit tests are valuable, I take a more sparse notion of them.  Based on code review and design, unit test the code that you have worries about.  Where you think there's a greater chance of a seemingly innocuous change breaking the code.<p>I've seen little value, in the projects I've been a part of, with the BDD/TDD approach.  It does seem like a lot of busy work and not a lot thought put into where the value is.  And there's actually pretty good industry data (and I suspect open source data as well) that its actually not hard to determine what parts of a program are going to be the buggiest in production.  I'd really love to see a test approach that is density driven...<p>But with that said, if you're writing a 20,000 line web app, TDD/BDD is probably fine.  You can generally kick out the code and get full test coverage in very short order.",1283637028
1663471,comment,1662704,1662960,0,0,rdtsc,,,"""Globalization"" is a great newspeak kind of word.<p>It's meaning in the propaganda domain means breaking down of boundaries between nations, free trade, exchange of knowledge,  culture, the world becomes a more connected, and of course, a better place for everyone.<p>It's actual meaning is that large corporate entities only get to freely move across national boundaries in order to exploit market (consumer or labor) inefficiencies. China was a boom for a cheap labor market. It will become less so as the standards of living rise. So some companies are eying Vietnam. If Africa stabilizes, it might be next.<p>In fact, in the real sense globalization usually means anti-globalization. In its best form it is using governments in order to set tariffs, international trade restrictions, copyright agreements, immigration policy and so on. The ""free trade"" is usually the free trade imposed on other, weaker, countries by the corporate of the stronger countries.<p>The propaganda meaning of globalization is very useful in discrediting any of its opponents.

It's at the end of the line, not because of lack of potential, but it's so simple and powerful than any improvements to it can be implemented in LISP itself without affecting the core language.

1663448,comment,1662704,1663276,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"You are anthropomorphizing ""Capitalism,"" as a sort of aggregate of all capitalist behavior, but with a single goal. That's not accurate. <i>Individuals</i> certainly try to accumulate wealth, but the best way to make a lot of money is to find a better or cheaper way to do something--a side effect of which is the impoverishment of somebody else. Just look at, e.g., the way Sun nearly killed IBM in the late 80's and early 90's. Sun never made as much as IBM did, but the people who founded Sun made more than they otherwise would have.<p>That, I think, is why you see internal contradictions. You're pointing out that the best capitalists do stuff that harms the average capitalist; if Myspace is making money, there's always a Zuckerberg waiting to ruin things. But of course, there is no ""Capitalism"" that encompasses all of the goals of Myspace's owners <i>and</i> Facebook's.<p>That also takes care of the apparent contradiction of outsourcing. The capitalists who lose to outsourcing don't like it; the outsourcers do. There's less money made (since the outsourcers charge less), but the economy is more efficient. That's capitalism--the net result of lots of self-interested people, who often act against one another's interests. It's not the vision of capitalism in which the rich, as a group, make consensus decisions to advance their collective interests.<p>Thus, that version of capitalism is wrong.<p>Oh, and slavery and colonialism are much, much older than capitalism as we understand it today. In fact, one can make the case that slaves are the oldest form of property. Certainly, I've never heard of a civilization that advanced at all and never had slaves.",1283636277

This is at best a teaser at his book, for a real discussion we'd have to get and read that.<p>But even beyond that, I heavily disagree with the whole discussion. If I haven't missed some important new advance, the whole parallel universes theory and much of the theories of what happened before or during the beginning of the Universe are not really science. Most of it is based on some speculative interpretation of the mathematical formulas of quantum physics and/or string theory.<p>But there is no reason those formulas have to be an accurate description of the physical laws in those boundary conditions, where they are known to break hard. So basically they make assertions based on a mathematical theory (which is not bad per se), but those assertions cannot be falsified, as they all operate outside the boundaries of the Universe itself. Non-falsifiable theories are just not science.<p>The same goes for the strong anthropic principle. This is again making statements that are inherently not testable. That might be philosophical speculation, but it's not hard science.<p>This is particularly strange as Hawking uses those borderline scientific theories to discount a religious speculation; but both theories are non-falsifiable by definition, so what's the point?

Many governments participate directly in their healthcare markets, which affects the prices at which pharmaceuticals can be sold in such a country. If goods with manipulated prices are allowed to be traded freely, the prices in other countries will be affected as well. Companies that produce the goods in question will either have to accept lower profit margins or refuse to sell their goods in manipulated markets. Regardless, such a policy would lower the expected value of future technological advances in the field, which would result in less effort being directed to such advances.<p>It is undesirable for technology to advance at a slower pace than would be possible if people were expected to pay market prices for the products the technology would help to improve or create.

1663428,comment,1663381,1663381,0,0,derefr,,,"The only real way there has ever been to make sure the computer is following your instructions, is to tell those instructions to it twice. (Non-inferential) static typing is about telling the computer the input and output types of your functions twice. Unit tests are about telling the computer the algorithm (or an equivalent, such as a direct mapping function from a subset of example inputs to pre-calculated outputs), twice. These are both just protoforms of Reliable Computing—the name for the actual software <i>engineering</i> that NASA and friends do, where they make the whole <i>system</i> twice (or more) and then run those systems in parallel to ensure they're always ""voting"" the same way.<p>But sometimes you don't need <i>engineering</i>; sometimes you just need a dirty hack. Hacking is basically the opposite of engineering: it espouses DSLs and macros that encode everything exactly once, it prides elegance and other aesthetic factors of code above engineering tolerances. And, of course, it's a lot more fun to do—so it gets people interested in your code, which can actually be the best thing, even more so than engineering it. Linux is a big hack, and because of that all sorts of people enjoy working with it. _why was an eminent hacker, and because of that his code (and tutorials) are still used when getting people interested in coding. None of this code is <i>guaranteed</i> to work, unlike code that has been engineered—but that's okay, in 99% of cases.",1283635832

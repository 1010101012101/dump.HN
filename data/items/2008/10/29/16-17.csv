I had a fight with the CEO where I told him, ""You're screaming about cracks in the plaster, I'm telling you it's because the whole foundation's rotten. If we keep plastering over it without fixing the real problem we'll never stop having these stupid issues.""<p>Didn't happen.

I'd have put your comments to -1, but not further, because I do, like apparently many, believe that your notions are fundamentally flawed.<p>Complexity theory isn't hand-wavey-ultra-complicated-irrelevant CS; it's first / second semester stuff.  It's fundamental enough that it's a cognate for most lots of physics, math and engineering students.  That's to say, that it's relevant enough that if you're even doing something moderately related to computer science that it's worth knowing.<p>Are there a lot of jobs where you don't need to know this stuff?  Well, I think there are a lot of jobs where you can <i>get by</i> without knowing basic CS, but it'd still benefit you from time to time to be able to apply these sorts of abstractions.<p>""Why is this function so slow?""<p>""Its runtime is quadratic.""<p>""Huh?""<p>In my particular case, not knowing fundamentals of CS theory would cut me out of being able to work on precisely the problems that I find most interesting in programming.",1225299554

347611,comment,347355,347442,0,0,mseebach,,,"> Can anyone seriously argue that ingredient labels are anti-market?<p>Well, there are two factors:<p>1) If the government mandates that a certain value is indicated on the label, it also vouches to a certain extent that the ""better"" value (lower for calories) is actually ""better"". So calories is OK, but it's a slope. How about an Atkins-adherence(or whatever)-index? The problem is that once such a measure is implemented, it is exceedingly difficult to get rid of it, even if it turns out to be bogus or even misleading, because the politician supporting it will be accused of being anti-consumer (why would s/he be against more information?), or just in the pocket of Big Food.<p>2: It may not be very cost effective to calculate the appropriate value. Consider a restaurant, where the chef that goes to the farmers market every day and gets whats really fresh and in season. The chef now has to commit time, everyday, calculating the calorie-count for each dish. More bookkeeping, less cooking. It may be easy to do for calories (I'm not sure, I'm neither a chef nor a dietist), but what if it requires samples to be sent to a lab somewhere?",1225298964

347597,comment,347019,347351,0,0,lhorn,,,"The problem isn't getting your files in the right place, the problem lies in how inter-connected and ""integrated"" everything is on Windows. There are many examples: ""Internet Settings"", for instance, from the control panel, while they seem to be IE's settings, actually affect how some Windows Internet-family API functions behave. Then there is a big hairy mess called COM/ActiveX: you can't parse XML without it, yet there will be computers, be it one out of 100, with broken XML parser COM registration. Same applies to various ""shell services"" which are essential to desktop integration.<p>Then there are cases when other applications break your code: Symantec used to install their own version of MFC DLL right into System32. Then there are super-aggressive anti-spyare/anti-virus/anti-whatever packages that are basically hacks breaking all kinds of legit software. Windows encourages this style of development: when an application essentially becomes a collection of COM servers scattered across your hard drive, hooked into your system via complex mesh of registry settings. And there is no way around it: this is what MSDN tells you to do.<p>Then you'll have users complaining that when they launch your RSS reading software (or whatever you do), they get a popup that says ""Windows Installer: configuring Microsoft Office"" that disappears after about a minute of ""collecting system information"". And users will tell you that everything worked great for 2 months but then ""computer did something"" and this popup started appearing.<p>And they keep adding more shit on top of existing shit. Now, in addition to COM and MSI and registry you get this ""side-by-side execution"" bullshit, when you can't even tell which version of a DLL is being loaded and Windows Explorer essentially hides fucking files from you so even locating a misbehaving DLL becomes a debugging session on its own, where you'll need to decode cryptic hidden directory names and extract a manifest from some executable's resources to see which DLL it actually wants. When they rolled that out I felt sick for a while.<p>And finally, there is no such thing as ""Windows API"" anymore. XP machine connected to a domain controller/AD is a very different beast than XP home or Win2K. I'm not even mentioning Vista here.<p>For my last Windows project I went for ""xcopy deployment"" with one single fat executable statically linked to everything it needed to run with some help from open source libraries, essentially very similarly to how Firefox does it. But this style of development isn't really for ""Windows Platform"", this way you're targeting a ""sane subset"" of Windows platform.",1225298571

347561,comment,347359,347359,0,0,moonpolysoft,,,"One of the issues that I see with this approach is that for most applications the scaling issue is data scaling rather than CPU.  Here's why I think you will run into scaling issues:<p>Lets assume you have a gigabit line out of your colo.  Lets also assume that your average game client is on a cable modem with a 1megabit connection.  That gives you capabilities to stream work units to 1024 clients simultaneously as an upper limit.  In keeping with an average 1 megabit client, it will take 3 minutes to stream down a 20 megabyte work unit, maxing their connection. 1024 concurrent clients * 20 megabytes = 20 gigabytes.  So you're looking at 3 minutes of overhead transfer out, and likely another 3 minutes or so of overhead transfer of results back from the client.  So that's approximately 6 minutes per gigabyte just in transmission overhead.  And it gets worse as clients are added to the system, since you would need scale out your datacenter just to handle coordinating all of the clients.  Which begs the question: why aren't all those servers just doing the dang work already?<p>That kind of overhead limits this technique's usefulness only to applications which have relatively high computational complexity and relatively small amounts of data.  And those applications do exist, however they're pretty far from the day to day needs of most companies.  Sun found this out the hard way with their Sun Grid project, which last time I checked was a failure.  Sorry, I really wish you the best of luck.",1225296840

This it the root of a very simple design philosophy, that much *NIX software adheres to.<p>Most thirdparty libraries provide a C-library that can be linked to an application - but it also provides a small tool that implements all functionality. Input values aren't ""resources"" or instances of this or that object. They are one of: Strings on the commandline, a piped stream or a file. And most often, all are possible. Output is a integer return value (typically just true or false), another stream or another file.<p>Windows does not have that single, simple API that everything adheres to, so there's no one culture of Windows development. Many of the APIs that exist in the Windows ecosystem, e.g. WMI, that I've been using to script IIS control, is perfectly well equipped to become a ""POSIX-killer"" - if it would just become pervasive. WMI is next to worthless when I can use it to control IIS, but not some other feature, and I can straight away forget about talking to the Win32 API altogether from Windows Script Host, and even in C#.net it's unnecessarily difficult.",1225296332

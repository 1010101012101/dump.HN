I do not want to spend my time doing this, at all. \n2. Linear Scalability.  Scalability is not about performance for me, it is about being able to predict costs, and to grow capacity without downtime or high cost surprises.\n3. Flexibility.  The ability to work without having to fight a schema.  No schema means no schema migrations (which goes to 1) but also no inherent assumptions in resource allocation. I've got a new idea that works a different way? Great, just add some new buckets and try it.  No more ORM impedance mismatches, no dealing with arbitrary SQL vagueness.   IF I don't like the mechanism for doing queries I can create a new solution.  Map Reduce should be enough for everybody anyway.  (joking!)",1297969190

2232273,comment,2231120,2231120,0,0,joeld42,,,"As a game developer, the recipe I like is C++ with classes but I try not to use inheritance/virtual functions unless there is a clear benefit. Instead, common code can be grouped into utility classes. For example, the classic ""Shape"" base class example with ""Circle"" and ""Triangle"",etc derived classes could be instead a ""Shape"" class that held a small list of arcs segments and line segments. Then a ""makeCircle"", ""makeTriangle"", ""makeRoundRect"" function.<p>If you have a few (hundreds) of objects and many types (circles, triangles,etc) then the ""classic"" example is better. But in the real world, you often have many (millions) of objects and a small fixed number (say, <10) of different types. Knowing that everything is a ""Shape"" (and not just something that implements its interface) is very powerful, for example you could collapse all your segments into a spatial data structure and not even keep the ""shapes"" list around anymore.<p>One of the best things you can do is realize just because you have classes, doesn't mean you can't still use plain functions anymore. I hate it when I see classes like ""ObjectMunger"" with a function ""munge()"" ... just write the munge function unless there's a good reason to do otherwise.<p>Templates are actually a good feature if you don't get carried away. But too often I see people use templates like FooMuncher<float> fFooMunch; where <float> (or something) is the only type that is ever instantiated. Why bother templatizing something if you're not going to use that flexibility. If you want a double-precision foo in the future, you can always search and replace ;).<p>Look at the EASTL library for a nice alternative to the STL that fixes some of it's warts such as the clumsy allocators.",1297969088

You can't legally blow up my home, even if I accept a free device from you and press the buttons you told me to press, unless you were very clear about what the device would do (and no, claiming in the license that it is not meant for anything does not nullify the website and the examples of what the code is obviously supposed to do). Going from the realm of the obvious to the realm of the somewhat less obvious: if you give me a free bicycle, knowing it's fron fork is starting to give way, you are responsible for my skull fracture if you don't tell me about it.

One thing in particular jumps out at me:<p>> Ultimately, a programming language that's useful for large-scale programming projects needs to have clear, unambiguous grammar and syntax so that any developer familiar with the project and the language can instantly figure out what's going on.<p>Wow.  There are just so many things wrong with this statement.  Let me enumerate them:<p>1.  Scala <i>does</i> have a clear, unambiguous grammar.  If it didn't there wouldn't be a Scala compiler.  I think what the author means to say is that languages need to have <i>less flexible</i> grammars (like Java does).<p>2.  Just because you <i>can</i> use all kinds of wild things to obscure your code doesn't mean you should.  If you prefer the ""boring"" way of doing something, then go for it.  You just have to understand that just like anything else in programming, it's about tradeoffs.  Does the benefit gained from using a DSL or operator overloading outweigh the costs?  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.<p>3.  The idea that a programmer (even one who's familiar with a project) can look at any given piece of code and instantly understand what's going on is a myth.  Even if that snippet of code makes perfect sense, you also need to understand the state the program is in before that piece of code executes.  Again, it's about tradeoffs.  You need to choose the method that allows programmers to understand code more quickly.  Sometimes using metaprogramming is the way to do that.<p>I will grant the author that there are valid reasons not to choose Scala, but I don't think he's hit them.",1297968707

My N95 was probably the best cell phone I've ever owned. What it really looks like to me is that they were a hardware company whose upper-management didn't understand software very well.<p>My N95 ran Symbian S60 3rd edition. At some point Nokia decided that they wanted to protect S60 users from malware, and that they were going to do it by requiring all applications to be cryptographically signed. Unlike Apple and Google, Nokia  didn't want to shoulder the burden of running their own authentication infrastructure. Instead, the 'Symbian Signed' policy required applications to be signed with a TLS/SSL certificate. Those are typically pretty expensive. If you wanted anyone to use your little free S60 utility for auto-rotating the screen or setting location-aware themes, you had to stump up for a $700 TLS certificate to sign it. Guess what happened to the free-software ecosystem on S60.<p>Later, Nokia had what seemed to be a pretty good start on a Linux-based OS called Maemo. What the article doesn't say is that Nokia inexplicably joined forces with Intel and sent Maemo on a long and probably pointless integration detour with Intel's mobile Linux solution, Moblin.<p>Given that Nokia probably wasn't going to start making smart decisions wrt software anytime soon, getting software from someone else was better than being squeezed out of the smartphone business altogether.",1297968511

Antitrust--in the US at least--relates to the Sherman Act [1] and the Clayton Antitrust Act [2].<p>Example applications:<p>> - price discrimination between different purchasers, if such discrimination tends to create a monopoly<p>> - exclusive dealing agreements<p>> - tying arrangements<p>> - mergers and acquisitions that substantially reduce market competition.<p>While such things are always open to interpretation by courts, it's important to consider their historical application [3]. Standard Oil and AT&T aren't anywhere in the same league as Apple.<p>It's worth noting that the intent of antitrust law and enforcement is to protect competition itself. AT&T is a good example because the barrier to entry for creating a telecommunications company was (and still is) so high.<p>Of course the solution was ludicrous and one that the US seems to have not learned its lessons about yet: it swapped one large monopoly for 7 regional monopolies. But I digress...<p>The Microsoft case is often brought up. It was a controversial case. At the time it virtually wasn't possible to have a (useful) PC (which accounted for >95% of the computer market at the time) without Windows. What's more, the nascent Web posed a strategic threat to Microsoft, one it sought to subvert by giving away IE for free and making it non-standards-compliant in an effort to tie users to IE and thus to Windows.<p>Now compare this to Apple. Apple holds no monopoly on phones. It doesn't require carriers to only sell its phones. Anyone content you sell choose to sell through the iTunes ecosystem you can sell elsewhere.<p>What people typically mean when they say ""Apple should be investigated for antitrust"" is ""I really want an iPhone but I don't want one with Apple's restrictions so surely this should violate some kind of antitrust law right?""<p>No.<p>> Clearly Apple has a dominant position in online music sales<p>26.7% of music sales in 2010 [4]. Higher for online music sales I'm sure but is that a meaningful restriction? Antitrust isn't there to protect companies from competition. Any company can sell music. Amazon proves this. Apple doesn't require exclusivity.<p>The fact that to date any competition has been completely ineffective does not signal an antitrust violation in and of itself.<p>> Technological rate of change may be out pacing traditional regulatory adaptations.<p>There's no ""may be"" about it. And for this reason alone the DoJ will be reluctant to intervene (IMHO). For example, the Microsoft case was settled years after it had ceased to be relevant.<p>The market has a way of sorting these things out, at least as far as high-tech goes.<p>> It seems unlikely to me that Euro or US regulators will want to let a mobile computing platform become so vertically integrated that it controls all content, payments and communications arbitrarily with the only remedy being switching to a competing totally integrated platform.<p>No mobile platform has the sort of market share you're talking about to be relevant from an antitrust point of view.<p>I consider these vertical platforms to be a transitory problem and one that exists largely because the market is so new. These things will (IMHO) surprisingly quickly become commoditized.<p>It's for this same reason that I just don't really care about Facebook's apparent dominance of their space. Or at least I don't have the same sense of urgency about it that some seem to.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Antitrust_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Antitrust_Act</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=6025"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=6025</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.tuaw.com/2010/05/24/itunes-share-of-the-us-music-market-swells-to-26-7/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tuaw.com/2010/05/24/itunes-share-of-the-us-music-...</a>",1297968049

It is tough to say what source files are <i>built on</i>, but they are <i>composed of</i> lines of code.<p>The analogy of a source file to a song breaks down, because the source file is only useful because the application is built on it.

In return, Apple has found a way to give their customers value in return for monopoly.  By integrating all the parts--itunes (software and service), app store, ibooks, ipods, ipads, iphones, payments, etc---they can build things with a unified user experience that works.<p>Why I don't like this is that it makes it nearly impossible for Apple users to benefit from non-apple innovation in any of these areas.  Would you like to try someone else's tablet or phone?  Well I hope you didn't need any of that content from inside the apple ecosystem.  Want to try someone elses book or magazine store on your idevice?  Well Apple is now in the process of constructing barriers to this as well.<p>I don't accept your suggestion that people who don't like Apple's policies should ""leave apple users alone"" and choose an alternative.  Problems like this can sometimes be mitigating by shedding light on them through discussion and complaint (i.e., the uproar about developing apps in alternative languages).

These are significantly different dynamics for the tech world.<p>Finally, if there is currently a 'valuation' bubble, it is most certainly not an 'economic' bubble.

In other words, it's not enough that an anticompetitive act happened:  it must also have been used to preserve power — and not just any power but monopoly power, and not just any monopoly power but monopoly power in a market relevant to the anticompetitive claims.

The large rails app I use at work also has a few special-purpose internal DSLs of its own (for instance, to express permissioning restrictions), and they've made some things a whole lot easier to deal with.<p>These are features that can make a real mess, if abused, but bad programmers can make a mess in any language.

I'd also suggest that 100k is not a particularly large project; it's reasonably on the order of what a good developer can more or less be familiar with, and the real problems with expressive abuse come into play an order of magnitude or so above that that level, where it's impossible to be familiar with everything.

As a person who's done little more than fix typos, it's worth asking: is wikipedia also a more individualist environment than Demand Media [1]? Is OSS more individualist than the typical corporate environment?<p>1.2.2 seems to contradict other parts of the report - women both get a ""high level of attention"" and are unable to get attention (further in the report.) Not sure what to make of this one. [2]<p>The second report strongly suggests women can't cut it in software -  they lack the dedication (claim 1), are unwilling to work with mentors who are different from them (claim 2), they can't handle a text interface (claim 4), they can't handle competition (claim 6), and other women won't help them (claim 7). But the problem is, all of these claims apply equally well to for-pay software [3]. (Claim 5 is actually not a cause, but a result.) Only claim 3 suggests an actual difference between gratis software production and for-pay production - the use of gendered pronouns. (I'll hypothesize that HR does search and replace to eliminate these in big companies.)<p>So near as I can tell, the only relevant claims made by these reports are that either gendered pronouns or an individualist environment lead women to be unwilling to contribute. It wouldn't surprise me at all if there is an individualism/collectivism gap between OSS and for-pay software. That's an interesting hypothesis.<p>Another testable implication of that theory: women would be less likely than men to work as individual (i.e., non-accenture) contractors or work for startups, preferring instead the collectivist environments of big companies. Is this true?<p>[1] I recall reading that most Demand Media workers are women. Would love it if someone with more knowledge could confirm/deny this.<p>[2] Also finding the methodology of this report weak. To determine attention received, why take a poll rather than just running an experiment? I.e., post some newbie questions on mailing lists with male and female names, and measure the results.<p>[3] Maybe there is a gap caused by corporate use of Visual Studio as opposed to OSS use of emacs/vi?",1297966652

I use Netbeans and notepad++.<p>I user Firefox and firebug for debugging and testing.<p>The process I use is very amateurish, I code something in netbeans, something in notepad++ and since there is nothing to compile, I just refresh the firefox browser and test it. This is convenient and faster compared to the Java development enviornment where you would have to atleast compile and deploy the jar files before you could run them.<p>I have been thinking of putting a formal process in my development and find it hard putting it together. There are so many things to do before you can deploy your final web app. I keep hearing jslint, compression, unit testing (selenium), Ant, YUI compressor etc but I am now looking for some steps that I can take to make me more organized.<p>For e.g I use netbeans but don't use any projects within it. I directly update the files. I don't use any source control but use my Iomega backup that saves each save into a different version and at the end of the day I backup the dev directory to my Amazon s3 account. For me development environment is just a DEV directory, TEST is my intermediate stage and PROD is the final directory that gets pushed out to the server. But all these directories are in the same apache home. I have few php scripts that just copies the needed files into the production directory. Thats about it for my development approach.<p>I know I am missing the following - Regression testing (manual or automated ??) - automated testing (selenium ??) - automated deployment (ANT ??) - source control (svn ??) - quality control (jslint ??)<p>Can someone explain what are the missing steps and how to go about filling those steps in order to have more professional approach. I am looking for tools with example tutorials in streamlining the whole development to deployment stage.<p>For me just getting a hang of database, server side and client side development all in synchronization was itself a huge accomplishment. And now I feel there is lot missing before you can produce quality web application.<p>For e.g I see lot of mention about using automated testing but how to put in use with respect to javascript and php. How to use ANT for the deployment etc.<p>Is this all too much for a single or two person development team? Is there a way to automate all the above so that I just keep coding in netbeans and then run a batch file that is configured once and run it everytime to produce the code in the production directory?<p>Lot of these information is scattered on the web and here, if someone can guide I would be happy to consolidate here.<p>Thank you for your patience :)",1297966182

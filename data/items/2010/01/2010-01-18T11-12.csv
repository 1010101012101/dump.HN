Your shares are a smaller percentage of the overall company but end up worth more in absolute dollar terms.  (If that's not the case, the company is wasting other people's money - the value of your shares goes down, but this is deserved.)<p>In other words, if you go from a 1% stake to a 0.1% stake through dilution and then get $20K of a $20M sale, you haven't been ripped off, you just overestimated the company's ability to turn your initial 1% stake into something meaningful.",1263813999

1059726,comment,1059211,1059348,0,0,dkersten,,,"Its completely like I read everything but the last paragraph.<p>If mahmuds suggestion of Python is Ok, then I don't see why mine isn't either. The languages I listed are great for parallel/concurrent programming, much more so than Go and if you need low level access, you can write C extensions for just those parts that require low level access.<p>Go's concurrency support is weak, at best. Sure, its better than C (without libraries), but compared to other concurrency oriented languages, it doesn't really provide much. Other disadvantages are that Go is new and still under heavy development. If they decide to change something, then you're code gets obsoleted. You also have to use an immature toolchain, learn the intricacies of a totally new language and compiler and live without existing Go libraries. You could use C libraries, of course, but IMHO I don't see the value of using Go. Maybe in the future it can take on its role as ""better C"", but I don't believe its ready yet. If you want a ""better C"", try the D programming language.<p>By the sounds of things, you don't like the archaic C-ness of the C/C++ languages. Honestly, I don't see Go as much of a step up (yet! I'm optimistic that it could fill in its role as a better, safer C in the future), hence suggesting languages with some top-notch concurrency support which have been proven (well, not Clojure afaik) to work well in highly concurrent networked environments. If you were to use erlang, you would get all its fault tolerance and code hot swapping facilities almost for free too.<p>So.. no, I personally do not believe Go is ready for a serious project.",1263813600

1059722,comment,1059020,1059523,0,0,vl,,,"Diluting is balanced by desire of the shareholders to keep larger portion of the company and need for the fresh funds.<p>I.e. seed investors + founders + pre-seed employees (+ISO pool) share all the stock between themselves. Now they are all in the same boat: additional stock is going to be issued for Series A investment and if investment is too large, all of them get diluted too match, if it's not enough, company dies. If you are employee, you can't do much about it, but founders and angels are going to look after their own interest and protect you as well. In this sense the most important number for pre-seed employee is the ratio of his stock to the founders stock.<p>It's possible to issue additional stock and just grant it to some parties to dilute other party, it's quite hard to do because if diluted party is dissatisfied (and it usually is), it exposes company to litigation.",1263813276

Each time, we learned what experiment led to the new thoughts, and how surprising it was.  I thought this was a great way to learn the topic.  We didn't, however, spend too much time on the history and never read any of the original papers.<p>Note: We did have a great teacher.<p>On the other hand, one difficulty with teaching topics historically is that it is hard to group things by topics.  For example, in mathematics, the function is a relatively recent idea.  Newton died before the function was thought up, but calculus is usually taught as ""take the derivative of a function.""  This is not to say that history would be useless in this case, but it may require even more talent from the teacher.",1263812509

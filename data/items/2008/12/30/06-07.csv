414021,comment,413656,413656,0,0,bprater,,,"Maybe you should speak to the differences you guys are having. Are you both coding?<p>Are the style differences in how you are building the app hurting you?<p>Do you guys openly talk about the differences you are having and how to resolve them, or is it just 'high tension' all day long? Do you need to learn what the best communication style is between the both of you?<p>Is there a way to clearly separate the work you are doing so that one person has the majority of the input on what he's doing and can be focused, for say, a week or two at a time? At which point, you can go out to lunch, review things, set up your todo list and go your way for another week or two? Not working together in the same space may be a good idea.<p>I've been married 11 years and I've learned how to deal with sticky situations like this: it's simple -- you just can't always win.<p>You have to pick your battles and sometimes (often?) cede for the common good. You can learn to argue and still be fine 5 or 10 minutes later.<p>Also, you mention that you aren't passionate about the product. That is really bad news when you are a founder. Is there some way you can rewrite your job description so that you can find something passionate about the project that can carry you through the first year or two?",1230619771

In fact, according to a report by Frontline (""<i>Spying On The Homefront</i>""), Homeland Security started implementing such a system for monitoring all phone and Internet communications after the passage of the Patriot Act. I was going to say that it would probably be political suicide for a private company to participate but I just remembered Homeland Security actually contracted a private company to do this work for them. I can't remember the name of the company but you can watch the whole show  online:<p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/</a><p>Using writing style seems a little far fetched given the limited scope of variations in language relative to the large number of people using language.

It can figure out what class I am referring to pretty well. Ctrl+click works nicely to see the definition of a method (no matter where it is declared, and it finds them quite well, shows list of choices if it is unclear).<p>Definitely worth a try for ruby.",1230619208

Can you give any more description on what you like about it and what language you use it for?<p>EDIT: Maybe I am missing something, but this seems like a regular text editor with no nifty features like code outline.

Suzuki will train her ears, which is important, but that's about all it's good for.  It's designed so that kids reaquit shortly after they enter high school, and it leaves them mostly unable to sight-read.<p>Background: I am a violinist, playing professionally at weddings and such about once a month (full-time student), and I started on Suzuki.<p>btw, my father (who also had very little musical training) forced me to improvise (make up music as I went) for five minutes every day, even if it didn't sound good.  Today I am quite good at musical improvisation, a skill that is no longer really taught in the classical school of music.  I don't know if my dad's method would work for everyone, but I'd recommend it.",1230618802

Ouspensky isn't known as a novelist (he became a guru type) but up until the end where it gets a bit doctrinal, I thought it was a thoroughly delightful book. It's also a psychological tour de force, but I don't want to spoil the story by explaining why.",1230618130

(The term, in the 1970s, came to stand for the unanswered question of Why Is Software So Hard? And specifically, why so much harder than hardware.)<p>One thing I was surprised to see (in the discussion at the end of this piece) is that Peter Naur was among those falling for the idea of mass-produced components and the industrialization of software. He seems to have changed his mind quite dramatically later.",1230617694

Not only does Ebert's quote only consider big-budget mainstream games, but it also lacks perspective, considering the relative youth of the video game compared to other media.

(The Roland MicroCube, for example, is a very popular choice.  I even have one, and I'm normally a boutique tube amp snob.)<p>There are also little battery-powered headphone amps that clip onto your belt, but they tend to really suck sound-wise.

I would get most of my customers by going door to door and knocking on doors where I saw people with high grass.  In my area it was rare for a highschool/college kid to have a job at all, much less one requiring real effort.  It also helped that I was the one doing the work, not a crew of people working for me.",1230617311
413995,comment,413763,413763,0,0,gruseom,,,"I like Ebert's writings on movies a lot. But in this case, I get the sense that old age is a factor. Or more precisely, a certain rather distinctive kind of pessimism that sometimes afflicts old people. It happened to a professor of mine that I love. And earlier this year I heard an NPR piece about the 100th birthday of Claude Lévi-Strauss that talked about how he had lost all hope for humanity. As I said, there's a kind of distinctive quality to this that makes me think it isn't really about the state of the human race... it's rather more self-centered than that (which sounds more judgmental than I'd like).",1230617274
413994,comment,413743,413743,0,0,Timothee,,,"I was thinking about a ""Facebook for families"" just yesterday actually :)<p>When I started to think about it though, I realized that one thing is that you tend to be part of families that overlap. For example: my in-laws don't really know my siblings and even less my siblings' in-laws (whom I don't know very much myself) So, the schema tends to become exactly like Facebook: focused on user accounts linked between each other rather than families with members. So, I figured it wouldn't be easy to make it work since, as with any social network, moving over to a new one or managing multiple ones, is not easy.\nWhat are your thoughts about this? How do you deal with that?<p>Don't get me wrong though, I have been thinking about something like this for my family!<p>Also, what does the name Ramamia mean?",1230617193
413993,comment,413242,413410,0,0,Shooter,,,"There are definitely many more low-power tube amps available now.  There are some really neat ones in the 1.5 watt config. Even still, I think there is room in the market for more.<p>If you already have a larger tube amp for gigs and are obsessive about the tube tone, I'd recommend searching for ""power scaling"" and ""amp attenuator.""  You'd be very surprised with the sounds you can achieve at decent volumes.  You can buy amps with power scaling built in or you can retrofit the circuit.  Attenuators vary in quality, but they are easy to use external devices.  I'm addicted to tube amps...and I used to like playing in my office in downtown Chicago to blow off steam.  I often used a 30 watt amp with an Air Brake (attenuator) and I never got into any trouble because of the noise.  I was able to use the same amp to play a gig in Grant Park on a Saturday and then to play in my 10 X 12' office on Monday.",1230617122

Using Excel under Windows, I'm the master, knowing how to get to every menu item starting with Alt-(menu shortcut). I don't even have to look and it gets done. With other software, I'm not as good, but still better than average.<p>On Macs you can't drive menus like that. That's a serious productivity hit for me.<p>One question I would love to have an answer for: is this fixable using some kind of hack or installation of a program or something? That would be awesome.",1208080758

162331,comment,162274,162274,0,0,cousin_it,,,"Coding at night is good. But I noticed another thing: texts written at night suck. In the morning you will inevitably be ashamed of what you wrote. The best time for blogging or writing emails is the beginning of the day. I wonder if it's the same for other people, and why this is.",1208079708

162327,comment,161927,162127,0,0,thwarted,,,"You could also argue that launchd, specifically, is a divorce from the UNIX way of doing things.  init starts processes based on system events, xinetd starts processes based on network requests and cron starts processes based on time.  launchd is a monolithic solution that is decidedly unUNIXy, however cool and attractive a centralized solution may be.  It would be nice if these different programs had a common file format, but their file formats are reasonably optimized for the kinds of things they handling.  One could stick a unified ""edit process starting/stopping"" GUI on top of init, cron, xinetd, etc and you'd end up with some of that attractiveness.",1208079013

Around 1 or 2 am, I sometimes get a bang of energy and creativity that I never get during the day. It's the ""second wind,"" the injection (possibly) of cortisol and other stress hormones that cause my body to go into stress-protection mode. I become hypervigilant, which causes fewer bugs. I think more quickly, writing code faster and coming up with amazing design ideas instantly.<p>If you think about this from an evolutionary perspective, it makes perfect sense-- in the animal world, when you become stressed (i.e., a tiger comes up behind you, or you get exhausted looking for food) the outcome is binary: either you die or you live. So the body does extraordinary things to keep you alive, like make you temporarily smarter and more focused.<p>Over hundreds of thousands of years, perhaps, the body has developed in such a way that the lack of sleep for some number of hours (for me, almost exactly sixteen or seventeen hours) triggers the release of stress hormones which sacrifice the body's current state for mental and physical agility.<p>When will someone figure out how to hack my brain to make it like that all the time, without the nasty side effects (sleep deprivation) the next day?<p>More info:<p><a href=""http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/502825"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/502825</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine</a><p>I should do more research on this.",1208078977

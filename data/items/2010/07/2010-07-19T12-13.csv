Right now I have ~25 of them running at the MIT Museum, about half of those run exhibits and shut themselves off from 11PM to 8AM, a couple are used for desktops, the rest are running 24x7, some as servers, some as development machines. I've never had a Mac mini die. I'm in the process of moving our internal file server from a PowerMac G5 to a Mini.<p>We just got our first new, low-profile Mini and it's great. Not having to deal with the power brick is a huge win, and the power cord seats much more firmly than the old cords do.<p>I'm also experimenting with two Eee Box B202's running Ubuntu. One has been running 24x7 for the last 6 months without any problems.<p>Plug computers are interesting and for a while I thought they could make good controllers for touch-screen kiosks.

In JVM any native code tends to be prepared to cope with this somehow, but .NET is explicitly designed to be able to seamlessly interoperate with random COM and legacy native libraries, so you cannot guarantee that such native code will get back to GC safe point in any bounded amount of time.<p>Edit: you can do stop-the-world GC at any point of program whan you scan stack conservatively, GC-safe points are only needed for precise scanning of stack and registers, so this is problem only when you want to be fully precise.

To use ActiveSync, you have to be fairly tolerant and technically proficient. For example, when upgrading the OS, you have the responsibility(1) of manually backing up all your contacts, data, apps.<p>Contrast this with iTunes (yes, iTunes isn't elegant) - when iOS 4 came out - it downloaded it and asked if you wanted to upgrade your phone and did so without losing settings, data, apps. Now, Android supposedly can do OTA updates. The point here is if WinMo7 requires ActiveSync - it is severely behind the times.<p>I'm hoping WinMo7 won't require a user to use ActiveSync and it is all stored securely in the Windows Live cloud. I usually used lots of colorful adjectives when dealing with ActiveSync. I had a boss who was convinced to get a WinMo device by a co-worker; she lasted only about a month (ActiveSync).<p>(1) <a href=""http://www.htc.com/www/supportdownload.aspx?p_id=59&cat=2&dl_id=113"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.htc.com/www/supportdownload.aspx?p_id=59&cat=...</a>",1279543681

That was the reason to vote, to see what would come out on top. We know now, so why keep voting? There needs to be some personal and/or social benefit to voting.<p>Ideas:<p>1. Suggest movies from your ""haven't seen it"" picks that you might like based on your votes. You actually have a big advantage over Netflix and Amazon here because you have users telling you what they haven't seen. All the big companies know is whether the user has or hasn't bought or rented the movie.<p>2. Make themed subsets to vote on. Do a great 80s movie experiment. Or a great sci-fi movie experiment. Put up a new themed set each month or quarter. At least there will be something new on a regular basis then.<p>3. Let users see a personal top 10/100/1000 list based on their own votes. Of course, they will need to vote a LOT for this to make sense, but that's kind of what you want, isn't it? Maybe give them a percent of votes needed to get good results, like, ""You need to vote about x times to get good results. You're at 35%, keep voting!""<p>4.

Every day is important, because it builds momentum, keeps you focused on it and keeps you making progress.  The progress is important because it demonstrates that you're serious and not a flake.<p>2) Once you've made a bit of progress (say a few months), see what she needs from you in order to be supportive and see if you can work out a solution.  For example, if you're the sole breadwinner and she's worried about surviving, work out how much money you need to survive for a year or so and work out (with her) how you can achieve that.  If she's not willing to discuss it or compromise, emphasize to her how important this is to you.[1]  Involve her in coming up with solutions so she'll feel she owns them.<p>3) When you've got agreement, undersell on the expectations.  If you tell her it's all going to go brilliantly from day one she's going to be annoyed when it doesn't.  If you tell her it's going to be a long, hard struggle then she'll be more accommodating.<p>4) Keep her in the loop, so she can see stuff is actually happening, and celebrate what small successes you have.<p>5) When you get in fights and the business is brought up, don't respond.  Don't get into an argument over it as that will just cause more resentment later.<p>[1]  If you've been working on it for an hour or two a day for three months this will be demonstrably true.",1279541458

Then as soon as a full scale model is tried it turns out the economies aren't there any more for some subtle reason (and sometimes not so subtle).<p>The wing tracing out the movement of the tip of a turbine makes the wing a turbine, there is no way around that, and as such it will be governed by the same laws, there are no exceptions from that. 1MW is not just 2 orders of magnitude more complicated than 10KW, it is probably more like 3 or 4. I've hand built a 2.5 KW machine, I'd be very careful to extrapolate my hard-won knowledge to a machine that is only 4 times as powerful.<p>For lower power levels a slipring arrangement is customary to avoid twisting up the cable inside a windmill tower, at higher power levels the mill is usually steered in such a way that the cables will not tangle.<p>I'm very curious how this will develop, I'm a huge fan of renewable energy but I've been around the awea boards long enough that I'd like to see some longer term results and at higher power levels before getting really excited.

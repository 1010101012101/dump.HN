The sufficiently informed and conscientious covert actor can find some way to keep much of their communications obscured.

So does the state.<p>End result? It could well be that the motivated/educated still can keep enough of their secrets hidden, but communications for the mass of people who don&#x27;t have the reasons/resources for participating in the arms race end up largely transparent.

Hollywood is stranger than you could ever know. It makes a pitiful amount of money in relation to global capitalism, always has, always will. But it wields outsized influence on American policymaking regardless.<p>Another quote comes to mind. When Apple released the Watch, someone asked one of the top watch companies if they were worried about Apple butting into their market. He just smiled and said something to the effect of, &quot;Call me when they can figure out how to get men to wear diamonds on anything other than a watch.&quot;<p>Established industries have spent long, long periods of time getting to know their customer.

I&#x27;ve never read the source code to the software I use to encrypt my hard drive. It&#x27;s unlikely that I ever will.

It&#x27;s both.<p>But just because it&#x27;s speech doesn&#x27;t mean that the government might not have an interest in regulating it. The first amendment is not absolute. I can imagine a great many prima facie arguments supporting the idea of regulating encryption software.

If you want to discriminate against an employee in a certain group, you just give them low scores in a performance review. That way you can claim they are a bad employee to justify laying them off or terminating them.<p>Even if they did nothing to get low scores.<p>It sort of avoids discrimination lawsuits if they can document that the employee got low scores.<p>But this is fishy because he was given low scores while on leave.<p>Something like that happened to me while I was on short-term disability and in a hospital and at home. They had employees sign papers that I was doing all sorts of things to give me low scores. The dates when they claimed I was at work doing those things, I was in a hospital or at home and not at work. When I returned from short-term disability I was put on probation and then fired. They tried to use the stuff against me to block unemployment benefits but the state saw the complaints were on the same dates that I missed work and sided with me considering the complaints were made up. I could have sued for discrimination but it was the best law firm in town, and they could have proven an undue hardship defense because they hired a software consultant for $100/hr to do my job because none of my coworkers could do it.<p>So I would like to see the manipulation of the low performance ratings to be investigated. You see the years prior I had gotten high scores and pay raises, then as soon as I got sick, low scores and complaints.",1454467689

I saw a man who did not receive enough affection from his wife and spoke needily to others, reaching out for warmth. I saw a woman who appeared to be dissatisfied in her marriage, lingering just a bit too long in hugs with other men. I saw a man who was uncomfortable with parties, and wanted to corner me in a private discussion so he could disengage from the group. The feeling that these people were unable to mask their deep and private needs in this public forum combined with the feeling that something was expected of me that I could not give sent me into a spiral of embarrassment and nervousness.<p>Becoming terrified that I would be unable to control my emotions (that I might begin weeping in front of everybody for example), I disappeared without a word to hide in my car. Fearing that I would be seen and mistaken for a criminal waiting to commit a crime, I tried to stuff myself into a ball on the floor of the backseat. I was convinced that someone would see me and call the police, and I&#x27;d be arrested because I would be unable to communicate with them. The fear was so intense that I could feel myself shivering, and when my wife came to rescue me I was unable to speak in a steady voice.<p>Over the course of the following year, I struggled with depression and crippling social anxiety, which I had never experienced before. Things as routine as taking my cat to the vet were a real challenge, and I relied on Xanax to get me through a number of totally banal interactions which I had previously handled automatically. Granted, I was also experiencing intense social isolation and a weakening support system due to unrelated factors - I cannot definitively pin my struggles on this incident with cannabis. Still, it scared me enough that I began researching and critically examining my cannabis usage.<p>Ultimately I decided that it would still be a part of my life, but that I would no longer use it in public settings, that I would be exceedingly careful with dosage and reduce my usage in general, and that I would examine my current state before using it. I&#x27;ve recovered 100% from the depression, 95% from the anxiety (I still feel mild nerves speaking in group settings, like introducing myself at a meeting), and I have never had a bad cannabis experience since. I have also decided that using other drugs with psychedelic effects is not worth the risk for me, and I have sworn off them altogether.",1454467401

The real issue is that government is running up against scaling limits.<p>Arguably, a government can only rule over how people relate within boundaries it can defend and control. Previously the boundaries were physical geographies, and then regulated channels (mail, PSTN, etc). Now, we have a kind of fractal boundary of peer-to-peer connections that provide tremendous freedom to organize and transact on a diminishingly microscopic scale.<p>Sovereignty is zero sum.<p>Crypto provides a kind of micro-sovereignty to users, and for a few privileged or outlying people this is an acceptable risk, but when you have constituencies of people achieving that micro-sovereignty, it cuts into the sovereignty of the state at critical level.<p>Imagine the strategic consequences for U.S. national security if Rhode Island became it&#x27;s own country, with an impenetrable laser air shield, with it&#x27;s own allies, currency, tax laws, extradition treaties, defense systems, resources, etc. It would be such a constant threat, it would make more sense to just invade.<p>Tor and similar systems could reach that critical mass, where they become a constant threat to the sovereignty of nations. Tech is naively forcing hard questions about the conventions that provide &quot;stability.&quot;<p>The feds know they might just have to just outlaw crypto. The technology exists to detect and round up most people who use it, or enough of them that it will be hard to find people to use it with.

The power hitting any given spot on the planet is far from constant due to weather, day/night cycles and seasonal shifts. For a given solar installation, there might be a time where the ambient intensity (power per unit area) of the light has the cells biased just-so, converting energy at a near ideal efficiency. Of course then the conditions change and this isn&#x27;t the case any more. When you run into that scenario, i.e. the sun has moved a bit, it becomes very useful to have some kind of mirror or lens to increase the intensity by collecting more of the light and concentrating it to a smaller area, thus bringing you closer to your ideal operating point.<p>You&#x27;re correct that at some point you get undesirable transients, or you just melt your cell. I do that by accident more often than I&#x27;d like,  by shining infrared lasers at a photo diodes while forgetting that I&#x27;ve left a microscope objective in front. Expensive mistakes.<p>Now re: the article, if you ask me the really interesting thing here isn&#x27;t being able to focus light to really small areas per se, but that they&#x27;ve broken the diffraction limit. This means you can form an image of an object that is smaller than a half-wavelength of light. For e.g. red light, that means you can <i>take a picture</i>, an optical picture, of something like, say, a mosfet on a chip. Or a virus. That&#x27;s quite something.<p>I&#x27;ll note however that I could foresee (read: speculate) a scenario where having such a tiny focus, like the solar cell scenario, could invoke a quantum mechanical effect in some special material whereby the light coupling becomes much greater, thus increasing efficiency or something. But that&#x27;s just science fiction as far as I know.<p>PS: Sorry if this is patronizing. I know nothing about my audience ;-)",1454465335

327307,comment,327306,327306,0,0,mlLK,,,"btw, here is Turing's intial claim: I PROPOSE to consider the question, 'Can machines think?' This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms 'machine 'and 'think'. The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of the words 'machine' and 'think 'are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, 'Can machines think?' is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.",1223513820

I agree that, at least to me, convincing someone to let you out of the box doesn't really sound impossible.  In the post he says he chose it as the example of something ""impossible"" specifically because it's about the easiest thing he could think of to achieve and then discuss that to many people seems impossible.  He's just aiming in the post to give people a real sense of what it means to try to solve an impossible problem, and try with the actual goal of succeeding.<p>I also think formulating a provably friendly AI probably actually is an extremely hard problem.

(Risk because the system is broken enough now that the outcomes are often near random).<p>The ""best"" thing to do is settle for less than the fixed cost + your willingness to gamble. This creates a system of minor extortionists knowing that by simply filing suits and collecting settlements they can sap wealth from businesses that create it almost without effort.<p>Whats best for the one business (to settle) is not best for all businesses because it perpetuates the broken status quo.<p>What it takes to stop this cycle is for individuals to stand up and say ""No. That's a step to far"", even if it means loosing more than taking the ""rational"" option of settling.<p>To put it slightly more succinctly, to say as nations do ""We will not negotiate with terrorists"".

If you have items in the $15-$50, and I click on Less than $10, I'm just going to be annoyed.<p>3) Unless I am missing something, there is no way to sort search results.  I would potentially like to be able to sort based on release date (how much are new games?) and price (what's the coolest game I can afford?) and popularity (what's selling best right now, a great deal?)<p>4) Are you just adding the shipping cost into the seller's cost and then saying the shipping is free?  The prices just seem a little weird.

So someone is going to buy my game on the website via CC, and then if we work out an arrangement, I'm going to reimburse them via check off-site?

At first I was a bit skeptical, thinking that this doesn't offer much more than Amazon Marketplace and/or Ebay, with much smaller audiences.  However reading the responses here shows that the lower fees and simplicity of the process is a win for the seller, if not necessarily the buyer.  You should really stress these advantages to first time and/or potential sellers to get them interested.<p>Any chance you will let users offer compound Standing Offers?

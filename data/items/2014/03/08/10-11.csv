7364874,comment,7361947,7363438,2,0,klibertp,,,"Seconded. I recently evaluated quite a few Scheme implementations for a very simple web scraping project and found Chicken to be both fast and great with its packages. chicken-install feels almost like pip or npm and it works really well. The packages are many and most of them are nicely documented. If you need a Scheme with compile-to-C capability and a bunch of batteries included then Chicken Scheme is the way to go.",1394276312

Engines can fall off because of damaged mountings.  Engine turbine disks can explode and take all control systems with them.  Gears can jam and elevators stuck causing planes to nosedive.<p>You are talking about a highly pressurized canister of air travelling at the better part of the speed of sound way up in the sky, and it must be made as light as possible.  It&#x27;s a marvel they are as safe as they are.<p>> Remember, you&#x27;re far, far more likely to be injured or killed driving a car than taking a plane. It&#x27;s one of - if not the - safest form of transport out there.<p>Right, and this is an indication of how safe one can make things even given inherent risks in the technology.  It&#x27;s worth remembering how much we devote to this task.  And there are plenty of near-misses that are just mind-boggling, like BA-9, for example, where the 747 flew through the ash cloud of a volcano and lost all four engines as well as rendered its windshield more or less opaque.  And yet they still landed safely.<p>Aircraft are amazingly safe as they currently are.  However structurally, there isn&#x27;t a lot of room for redundency.",1394275676

I know that vBulletin also has forms for registration of minors and the like. I&#x27;m also pretty sure those terms & conditions are tl;dr documents of legalese nobody bothers to read though.<p>The software itself... it has pagination, woot. With the minimalistic style and html (compared to vB / IVF) I think you could do with infinite scrolling (optional depending on device, it&#x27;s still kinda sucky on mobile) or something clever like that.<p>I want to make a remark about the apparent lack of functionality, but that would be unfair; I&#x27;m a vB user, the only things I use on there are just reading and writing posts. vB forums like mine often do have a lot of user post customization though; postbits with all kinds of information, personalized (and larger) avatars, tl;dr signatures, custom post styles, that kinda thing. It may sound trivial, but it&#x27;s a form of self-expression a lot of our users appreciate. See also: Tumblr&#x27;s user&#x27;s eyesore styles.<p>The events page is neat, and as far as I know not something the competitors have in that form - looks like an unique selling point to me.

I only used the death numbers from car accidents though, so the likelihood of dying in a car accident is the actual likelihood as observed in the past.<p>The number of cars and number of planes does not matter in the above calculation, because the numbers are normalized to miles/person. More planes in the air is not likely to increase those normalized numbers by any significant measure.<p>Now, (1) is a fair point and I must concede on that.

The main difference may have been that you had a good grounding in the subject, so taking basic notes would have been a waste of time.<p>I guess we are talking about different kind of lectures. My experience comes from 5 years of mathematical courses with very dense material. Just taking &quot;basic notes&quot; doesn&#x27;t cut it there, because only an approximation of a definition is mostly worthless. And regarding proofs, if I understand the subject good enough that I can boil down the essential steps of a proof while seeing it for the first time then I don&#x27;t really need to take notes at all. So I&#x27;m actually always forced to copy everything from the blackboard (if there are no official lecture notes).<p>And in these situations my brain is blocked with drawing characters instead of processing what is actually happening behind those characters. Yet, I do have friends that copy everything down, even if there are official lecture notes, because according to them it helps them processing the content.

Too much whitespace.<p>This has been a hard fight for us, that single issue, as the vast majority of forums set the font far too small (10px) but information density is high. We&#x27;ve used vBulletin and phpBB as our compare point and we show 8 items per page where the default theme from those would show 10, but ours are far more readable.

It&#x27;s definitely one of the more frequent pieces of feedback.<p>#2. Started and Replied are extremely critical.<p>Remove them and engagement drops off. Started helps people choose, from the newer items, which ones they want to read and reply to, based on who started it. Replied is extraordinary, remove it and people do not go into the item and make their own reply, they stop engaging with it. People tend to hit the page of items, scan for who made the last reply and when, and then make the decision to go into it. The ones who make the most comments navigate by the engagement of others, not by the topics and subject of the items.<p>We experimented with that, and even the absence of the last author&#x27;s name on the list of forums continues to generate feedback. We think we can just about get away with that one, but the numbers are strongly against removing them from the item list.<p>#3. Agree wholeheartedly, a number of designs are possible but our defaults today are equivalent to Twitter customisation.<p>We plan 3 levels of theming and customisation and they are all effectively supported already but not yet available for a number of dull reasons.<p>The first: Twitter customisation: Logo, background colour/image, font colour.

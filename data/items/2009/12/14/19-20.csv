It's not, by 100 chars. Even shortening the object references kept it a bit longer. I don't think this defeats the rest of my points though.]. It could further be shortened, a lot -- to the point that for all practical purposes it's as small as a non-memoizing version.<p>- I tend to use a camelCaser in much more than simple animation loops -- any time for example that the style attributes for any element are referenced. i.e., it qualifies as an inner-most function.<p>- Although it's true that in animation loops you just have to beat the frame rate, let's keep in mind that there are a wide variety of processors and systems in use, and not everyone is using the latest dual-core Intel system with 3 gigs of RAM.<p>As a point of personal style, I much prefer to take the shortest, fastest, least-resource-intensive path for any given task, even if it's not strictly necessary to do so. As an end-user, I'm disgusted beyond description with the mindset that has become so prevalent among programmers, where efficiency is something that should be solved in hardware. It's absolutely frustrating that there are sites where the programmers have made so many concessions to speed in the name of rapid development that I can't even get the site to load in a few seconds on a 1.5 ghz G4.<p>So, yes, you're right, but I think the bit from David Marks' code is still naive and still does not make best use of the language:<p><pre><code>    camelize = function(name) {\n      var m = name.match(reCamel);\n      return (m)?([m[1], m[2].toUpperCase(), m[3]].join('')):name;\n    };</code></pre>",1260819264

Then it can take advantage of any seek-minimizing physically-near blocks over a much larger window of time.<p>(For those occasional skip exceptions, data could be pulled from a smaller lower-latency system, or from a smaller set of 'whatever happens to be ready' fill-ins, etc.)",1260817786

For now, the key features are:<p><pre><code>  * Single-screen application: see and work on everything at once\n  * Consistent structured approach to each opportunity\n  * Step-by-step workflow, emphasizing ""what I can do right now""\n  * Tracking of key contact information and interview times\n</code></pre>\nThe goal is to job seekers to parallel-process many simultaneous job opportunities, with the result hopefully being a shorter job search time.  This is my first HN soft-launch. I'd appreciate any feedback!  Thanks for taking the time to look.  The questions I am pondering are:<p><pre><code>  * Is the workflow logical?\n  * Does the sales funnel function effectively?\n  * Does the product pitch resonate?\n  * Is the current product a complete MVP? What's missing?</code></pre>",1260817733

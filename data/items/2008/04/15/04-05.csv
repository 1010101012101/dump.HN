One of my advisors put it thus:<p><i>A PhD is just a union card.  What you do with it is up to you.</i><p>You can use it to establish credibility in certain lines of work; you can use it to command a higher salary in industry; you can simply apply the things you've learned in some totally unrelated field.  A surprising number of people choose the latter.",1208233591

163805,comment,163718,163773,0,0,ible,,,"I don't doubt that most competent self-taught hackers could learn to do CS research if they were interested. A passionate interest in the learning new things, without waiting for someone else to teach you, is fundamental to teaching yourself to hack, and that same attitude is the main component of doing research. imho the biggest difference between hacking and doing 'research' is the mental shift from building something to creating new knowledge, whether it is a way of solving a problem, or something more abstract.<p>The most valuable things I've gotten out of the formal process has been the built-in mentorship provided by a good supervisor, the community of fellow students, and the opportunity to work on something with no immediate economic value. If you have the time/money, and don't mind harassing strangers via email you can get some of that without going to school for it. Still, if that mentorship, community, and money wasn't valuable, no one would be applying to ycombinator.",1208233229

163800,comment,163718,163773,0,0,timr,,,"I don't think that ""hacking"" is fundamentally different than research, in the sense that they're both forms of problem solving.  The difference is one of purpose and mind-set:  a good researcher is more interested in proof-of-new-concept than in implementation and polish.<p><i>""Is going though a structured process or some kind of apprenticeship to a good researcher a necessity?""</i><p>Theoretically?  No.  Ideas are ideas.  Anyone can have good ones.<p>Practically speaking?  Yes.  If nothing else, you need the time and training to become familiar with your field, the terminology and protocols in common use, and the boundaries that define interesting problems.  Furthermore, most cutting-edge research is expensive;  you need the apprenticeship before anyone will take you seriously enough to give you the money needed to do interesting work.",1208232702
163799,comment,163718,163773,0,0,maximilian,,,"From my limited experience, I'd say most hacking is using the results from research to get shit done - Not that hacking isn't great, its just not generally research.  However, it'd be pretty hard to ""hack"" a new filesystem without a research component.  But designing a website doesn't usually involve much research (learning a framework isn't research in the sense i'm trying to describe).  Designing a new web framework could be research because you need to test different ways of doing things and people might use your results.<p>Where normal design and normal engineering turn into research isn't the easiest thing to define.

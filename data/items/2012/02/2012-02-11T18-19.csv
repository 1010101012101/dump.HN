I bailed for Chrome even though Firefox's version of Adblock is vastly superior.<p>Firefox <i>still</i> runs poorly for me and until that changes they have no hope of winning me back. Who knows, maybe it's partly my fault that it doesn't run well or maybe there are some settings I can tweak to boost it's performance but even if that were the case I want my browser to work out of the box.",1328986755

3579851,comment,3579088,3579492,5,0,adunsmoor,,,"Tcl is used quite heavily as a command line shell EDA tools. Google ""pt_shell tcl"" or ""ncsim tcl"" for examples.<p>Cadence and Mentor Graphic's digital simulation GUIs were built with Tk. Probably a lot more. The big win for Tk in GUIs in the late 90's was it's cross platform support. For all of its limitations - Tk was a huge improvement over Motif!<p>Tcl is also used as a data file format for describing desing rules. Synopsys' SDC (standard design constraints) and Cadence's CPF (common power format) are both just design specific variations of Tcl. Writing a parser for these formats just requires writing command implementations. Tcl takes care of the rest.",1328986579
3579850,comment,3579626,3579626,1,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Not surprising. I adopted Firefox back when it literally first came out. (I was a Netscape user) And it's NOT that Firefox has gotten bad, its UX and UI just didn't evolve fast enough to keep up with other browsers.<p>I think Firefox power-users will stay because of its flexibility and advanced options and all those things they like but normal users don't care about. But if you look at it from an average, every day consumer's point of view, Firefox fails to provide an experience as smooth and nice as Chrome's.<p>Stability wise, Firefox is way behind. At least in my situation. I have a custom PC, Windows 7, no bloatware, extremely stable, my computer is ON for months without being restarted. I've got Chrome up and running for weeks and weeks at a time without it being shut down and reopened with over 80+ tabs open at all times. I kid you not. 80+ tabs. I keep them up because if I file them away as bookmarks I'll never see them again, so they just kind of stick around. I can still photoshop, and illustrate without having to close Chrome. When I try that with Firefox the poor browser falls flat on its face. After a few hours of having all that open my system starts to get sluggish. Most of the time the Firefox crashes due to an unresponsive script or flash. In Chrome only 1 window crashes and I can just refresh it, in Firefox the whole browser crashes. -_-<p>So little by little I migrated to Chrome, so did the rest of the family. It's easier to work with, less dialog boxes, silent updates, extensions don't break when you upgrade, etc...<p>MORAL OF THE STORY: UI & UX matter, a lot.",1328986492

3579846,comment,3578823,3579750,0,0,kls,,,"Yes I understand that MVC predates the web, but it's surge in popularity was definitely from it's adoption as a best practice for web development and the web for the most part took the traditional view of MVC. That being said it did see some popularity in many imperative languages for desktop application but nowhere near it's popularity after the web. But I would say it and Event/Widget style UI's where neck and neck until the web's explosion.<p>The thing is now we try to explain evented systems in terms of MVC and I believe that we are trying to force the definition when what we are really trying to say is separation of concerns. Here is a good thread from that period that goes over how the two became jumbled together: <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatsaControllerAnyway"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatsaControllerAnyway</a> it's long the tldr; is smalltalk took the traditional view that controllers are independent of UI, they don't even know what the UI will look like. Where widget based systems such as swing where utilizing the same definition, but yet widgets where tightly coupled to the view they control by being the intelligent manipulators of a discreet view, but proper separation is observed in that all view elements exist in a HTML (or other UI) files, and the controller is a code-behind file, together they represent a discreet element.<p>Traditionally, this has not been considered MVC until the web UI started moving back to the client and now due to MVC achieving almost religious omnipotence people are wary of something not being MVC even if they have to make the definition match the practice.<p>on an interesting side note, I often wonder had MVC been as popular before the web, as it was after the web, would an event model have been chosen for the browser?",1328986414

Statistics can certainly be made to lie (cf. the book, ""How to lie with statistics""), and there are a lot of aspects of human performance that are difficult to quantify. Performance under pressure is the first thing that comes to mind--reliably sinking a buzzer-beating three-pointer is a harder and more valuable skill to possess than just being a good shooter from beyond the line. You could try to quantify ""performance under pressure"", but a good scout will pick that up intuitively and probably do a better job of it. As always, the truth lay somewhere in the middle; a combination of both data and human input seems to be the best course.",1328986223

If you are a C-style language (which JS is), and you do something in a non-C-style way, you should have a very good reason (besides implementation artifacts and/or not thinking robustly about scope).

I'd agree that it doesn't matter much to Apple that Objective C isn't standardized (and not standardizing may be an intentional part of Apple's business strategy by increasing porting and switching costs).<p>But that also means that, no matter what its true potential is, Objective C will never be more than what Apple makes of it. It won't be seriously used outside of application areas Apple is interested in. It won't develop new features Apple doesn't care about. And if Apple decides to go in a different direction and/or runs into serious trouble, well that's it.<p>Apple has changed the world, but, unlike some other, standardized languages including the ones above, Objective C never will.

Finally (with 24 hours left to go to hit console launch) tracked it down to some audio drivers in the firmware that were erroneously writing 1 random byte ""somewhere"" at random times where the ""somewhere"" was always in executable code space.  I finally figured out that any given run of the game that ""somewhere"" was always the same place, luckily.  1st party said sorry, can't fix it in time as we don't know why it's being caused!  So I shipped that game with stub code at the very start of main that immediately saved off the 1 byte from the freshly loaded executable in the place I knew it would overwrite for that particular version of the exe.  There was then code that would run each frame after audio had run and restore that byte back to what it should be just in case it had been stomped that frame.  Good times!  We hit launch.<p>To this day I still feel very very dirty about this hack, but it was needed to achieve the objectives and harmed no-one :)",1328984546

You can charge a million dollars for a public domain work if you want. I believe a lot more content creators are on my side than you seem to think.<p>But yes, I have been forthright on these boards before about my desire to eliminate copyright. Sorry if I didn't make that clear in this post.<p>Also, you are correct, there are many benefits to digital works over their physical analogs. The increased ability to share is only one of them. Personally, however, I think it's the biggest benefit of all. Sort of like how modern cars have electric locks and air conditioning, but still their main benefit is their speed and carrying capacity. Hence my horse analogy. Esstentially, we're already in a post-scarcity society when it comes to information, and that change threatens people. But your mileage seems to vary, and that's cool too.

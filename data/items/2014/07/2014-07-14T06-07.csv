Clients expect them to <i>deliver</i>, and if only one project fails miserably because of a risky technology choice, then that will really hurt their image, and thus their sales pipeline.<p>As a result, their Technology Radar isn&#x27;t so much an overview of what is hot or not, but more of which of last year&#x27;s hot stuff really <i>made it</i>.

The kids would talk about getting advance copies of the final secured tests to bring home and practice with. I made copies of these tests, contacted the state department of education, and tried to report it. That was difficult and there was a lot of runaround regarding who would accept reports. Technically parents and others are not allowed to report cheating, it is to be done only by school staff.<p>I then contacted several local media reporters. They were surprisingly uninterested, perhaps since nearly everyone around has family members that work for schools in some capacity or another.<p>After contacting media though the state board must have heard what I was trying to do because the person in charge of testing at the state level personally contacted me, told me that although it might technically be considered cheating it wasn&#x27;t really cheating, and that there was nothing to report.<p>Why is all this? Everyone is cheating, everyone knows they&#x27;re cheating, and they all think they are so clever cheating the system because it results somehow in more federal funding via race to the top grants and the like.<p>I let my kids finish this school year. But that&#x27;s the last year in that system, and now we are going back to homeschooling where they can learn something. Despite the advantages of cheating, the school has almost total dedication to test preparation every day of the year and no time for real academics.

Let&#x27;s say to supply 5W at 5V, they needed to take in 7W at 120V. This means that voltage step down process results in some power being wasted as heat. By using a switching regulator they waste less power and thus there&#x27;s less heat output, but the power delivered to the device remains the same. So, in this example, they might only need to take in 6W at 120V to output 5W at 5V.

That word `legitimate&#x27; is very sneaky. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s close to racist to assert that black on white crime is a &quot;legitimate problem&quot; rather than just a &quot;social problem&quot; or a plain old &quot;problem&quot;. There are _fucking_ well documented systemic _reasons_ for why there may be statistically more (per capita or whatever) black on white crime than white on white crime. So it&#x27;s _not_ a legitimate problem. It would _only_ be legitimate if all other things being equal black on white crime was higher than other types purely because black people are black. If you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to or won&#x27;t see that you&#x27;re racist. It _is_ a problem, all crime is a problem, it&#x27;s _not_ a legitimate problem in that it does not legitimate racist attitudes towards blacks because only wilful ignorance could be blind to the socio-economic conditions that give rise to this crime.<p>> Yes ... &quot;Each generation was slightly more decadent than the previous.&quot; ...

Pieces of it died over the years (there was a time when basically nobody could get the game to run and the competitive sites all disappeared) but there have always been a handful of core sites that stuck around, and a handful of developers managed to revamp the game for modern play.

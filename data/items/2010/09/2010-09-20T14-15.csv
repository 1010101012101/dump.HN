1709039,comment,1707057,1708901,0,0,Cushman,,,"I... guess we disagree? I don't see what you're reading into the article, at all. As I read it he's <i>clearly</i> referring to long-named, psychoactive substances with every single use of ""chemical"". Anyway, not much point in arguing about that.<p>Your bringing up tryptophan is the <i>classic</i> example of what I'm talking about. Someone notices that turkey has tryptophan in it, tryptophan is psychoactive on paper, and suddenly the reason eating a big dinner makes you sleepy is because it's <i>drugged</i>. (Never mind that turkey doesn't have significantly more tryptophan than any other meat.)<p>The point is, as you note, there isn't a binary distinction. The difference is in dosage— is the amount of this thing that you actually encounter in your life enough to cause noticeable effects? If not, it may as well be inert. And nutmeg is a good example: the one chemical that the article <i>does</i> provide dosing on, and it turns out that it's basically impossible to get an actual psychoactive effect from it. I wonder what information about the actual concentrations of these ""psychoactive chemicals"" would reveal?",1284994736

If I'm at a good friend's place helping them on their machine, I might just want their company to shoot the breeze or have a beer with while waiting for Spybot et. al. to finish. Usually dinner's good enough since it means I don't have to expend any money or effort for it, and redirect it toward something relatively simple for me.<p>I have one neighbor who, under normal circumstances, I would have a hard time agreeing to help for free, but given that he and his construction company helped build our house(along with the fact that we trade wine / honey, and he helps us with other favors), it's something I'm more than willing to deal with. It helps that he generally listens to my advice too(i.e. back up stuff, don't use IE, etc.).<p>On the other hand, I have a friend who I'm just about through with trying to help, though. He has frequently has numerous problems with spyware that infects his machine, and will ignore my advice despite discussing it at length for 30 minutes or more, only to have the same problems arise again several months later. I've even suggested(and even gave a burned copy of) Ubuntu 9 for his mother who ""only goes on the internet and uses MS Office"" but declined to use it because ""he didn't know how to install it""-he didn't care that I could've walked him through it or that it was even easier than Windows...

In which case I don't see a good enough argument why Clojure isn't part of that.<p>That's because the author isn't saying that.  The point is more like this: Clojure is a series of new mutations, and they haven't been around long enough yet to tell whether any of them will survive natural selection.  We can't tell Clojure's good ideas from its merely new ideas at this stage; we have to wait for evolution to take place.  That doesn't mean Clojure is doing something <i>wrong</i> (after all, ""Everyone should be writing new Lisps!"").

I have also done joint development projects, me at a startup and my counterpart at huge corporations. While my bias is in favor of startups, I have given the other side a shot.<p>So the big deal with startups is this: If you do love your craft (not your job primarily), then a startup is the best place to apply it. There are a few reasons for this. 1) You get a huge amount of responsibility, assuming you join early. You are working on one of maybe three major components of your company's product, and that's a great opportunity to start with a clean sheet of paper and design and implement your ideas. If you really love what you do, that's a huge attraction. 2) There are politics everywhere, but a startup is really focused and politics are minimal. Idiot, empire-building managers aren't attracted to and don't thrive in startups, so that problem goes away too. (They tend to start showing up as the company matures.) 3) There is a real chance for a nice payout. You have to pick your startup wisely, and if you do it works out well. 4) If you stay on the boundary between far-out ideas and practical software, you will have an interesting, relevant resume, and keep yourself employable. I'm 53 and joined my 5th startup (pre-funding) last year.<p>The hype that you describe has nothing to do with startup life. There is a certain amount of aspirational nonsense here on HN, and self-actualization via startups tends to be part of it. But behind that, there is something of value. It isn't for everyone. I've interviewed software developers who are <i>terrified</i> by starting with a blank sheet of paper. I've worked with others who just aren't good at it. But if you happen to love what you do, writing software, and want to keep improving, learning, and taking on more, just because it's what you like to do -- if you don't look at it as just a paycheck -- then startups are a great place to work.",1284993651

Firstly, it is extremely difficult to enter the drinks market (setting up a countrywide distribution network, etc...).<p>What Coke also does (in some countries) is giving the owner of Cafes, garages and small shops a fridge (loan on permanent basis). The condition of the fridge is simple - the owner can only stock it with Coke-a-Cola products.<p>So right there the retailer is locked in - to distribute a smaller competitor's drinks, he would have to buy a whole fridge (or the competitor must provide a fridge). This is not likely - hence the lock-in. The customer is not locked in, the distributor is.<p>Another thing that Coke does is prevent competition between small retailers. You must sell Coke’s products at their recommended price (otherwise you have to pay more). They also sell the products to larger retailers at a lower price (and they in turn may not sell it at the reduced price to smaller retailers).<p>If Coke wants to launch a new product, they basically force small retailers to carry their product (whether they want to buy it or not).<p>So, yeah, Coke is a pretty nasty company.

It ended up being my job was almost entirely dedicated to just maintaining our branches: pushing our updates up to Main, and pulling in fresh changes about once a week. DevDiv has a term for this: BFD, ""Branch Facilitator Developer"", which for most teams is a full time job of nothing but merging code. For me it was about 70% of my job. Each branch took about 120 gigs of space on disk, and I regularly worked with about 5 branches. Merging our changes into main was a huge ordeal. We had to merge, do a full stack build (which took about 24 hours), and run every single team's tests, which took another 24 to 48 hours. From there it was a bookkeeping task of checking in on all the tests that failed and resolving them, doing performance testing, etc etc. All in all merging to main took roughly a week to pull off. The reverse was always interesting: pulling in new bits from Main to our branch was like playing Russian roulette, what was going to break this time?<p>To add a little spice to all of this, it all took place on alpha builds of Team Foundation Server that was being developed at the same time as everything else. Fun times :)",1284991554

Additionally, you seem content with material happiness (three houses, millions-worth, 3-bedroom condo)... as long as I have enough money to serve my needs, I'm happy spending time with friends or hanging out on a beach somewhere or traveling to new places.

In Scheme, the r6rs process was very difficult and divisive, and many people voted in favor of it while very publicly holding their noses. The r7rs process, if carried out as planned, will attempt to avoid the same kind of damage and will result in two language: a sparse core language and a featureful ""practical"" language. That larger more featureful language will be the one that is more useful outside of language research, and it is also the one that will change more over time, shielding the core language from the need to change. Scheme purists can stick with the core. Non-purists can embrace the featureful languages such as r7rs-plus (or whatever it will be called), Racket, and Clojure.

7658161,comment,7657394,7657394,3,0,shmerl,,,"<i>> his biggest surprise was Go is mostly gaining developers from Python and Ruby, not C++</i><p>Why is that a surprise? I think it&#x27;s logical, and Go can be expected to attract developers who are used to garbage collection (Java, Python, Ruby etc.). Not so much C++ developers who prefer to have control and choice (i.e. pay for what you choose, rather than get it handed down forcefully). Rust is a better candidate for attracting more C++ developers than those from Java, Python and Ruby background.",1398657530

Python developers writing non-Web products are probably using GTK, and so are Full Stack by default.<p>Full Stack&#x27;s meaning is more about the domain of interest, which is historically the Web. It doesn&#x27;t really have meaning outside of Web Development. Looking at MEAN, we have a delineation of the Web Application Stack: DB, Server, Front end, Tooling. It just so happens that this is a Full Stack in implementable via JavaScript, most importantly: a Web language, the lingua franca of the Web. &quot;Full Stack&quot; is historically associated with JavaScript&#x27;s maturity, but we can use this delineation of the Web Application implementation to retroactively make sense of non-JS &quot;already existing&quot; stacks that might correspond analogously.",1398657225

If something points to type t, should that be allowed to be nil. It is obvious that it should if coming from C/C++/Python, not so obvious if coming from Haskell for example.<p>2) Should the lack of objects, or should error conditions be represented by nil. Say lack of a an object in a map is indicated by returning nil. Should it throw an an exception instead? Now, go doesn&#x27;t have exceptions so it needs something like this perhaps. Or maybe panic should happen.<p>To expand on 1).  If you are coming from Haskell (or any strong typed language) the thinking is, you are already paying the price for static checking, strong types, compilation step etc. It would be nice to have explicit non-nil types.  You can say this function accepts a reference to this object and this cannot be nil. During compile time the typechecker/compiler will do a more rigorous analysis based on that, and barf out an error then instead of during production.<p>Like in Haskell you can explicitly say something may be nil (Nothing):<p><pre><code>       data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a\n\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t personally lean one way or another here. I just don&#x27;t have a strong opinion either way. I understand the trade-off. But this is how I interpret what the author means by his issue with &#x27;nil&#x27;. Hopefully this helps.",1398655926

Back then, GC was a rarity, the JVM didn&#x27;t exist yet. Software has to be ran on the user slow-ass computer, speed was everything and you didn&#x27;t care much about concurrency/parallel problem. Nowadays, even if the clock speed didn&#x27;t stagnate and we have just one super core in desktop computer, we would still write a lot more distributed system on the web now than we used to.<p>Also, we&#x27;re building more and more complex software over the year. I remember a question for Peter Norvig in &quot;Coders at work&quot;, where he was asked about the differences in programming now and back there. In the past, programmers generally had to write (mostly) everything from scratch, and they kept the whole program in their heads. Nowadays, we actually spend most of our time reading other API and trying to plug different components together, referential transparency is simply a godsend.<p>In a sense, I think the change from imperative programming to functional is similar to the one from GOTO to structure programming. May be we need a &quot;Mutable state considered harmful&quot; to push functional languages mainstream ? :-)",1398655810

In my research, I have a system that is go, java and python to tie things together. Super annoying to have such a polyglot system but I have different needs and each ecosystem offers the path of least resistance on each one of those needs. With the current go situation is not possible to create a re-usable package for the go code which is usable by other projects without breaking it out of the repo (which doesn&#x27;t really make sense in this case).<p>In anycase, I don&#x27;t want to solve dependency management with gopkgr.

7658041,comment,7657327,7657407,2,0,waps,,,"There is a problem in what the market will do if this is allowed to proceed. The TLDR is simple : if solar power buildouts are allowed to proceed the way they&#x27;ve been going, we will lose grid power entirely. Why ? Market forces. The problem ? Believe it or not, a lot of people can&#x27;t install solar panels (apartments, &quot;the poor&quot;, factories that need way more power than solar can ever provide, ...). Furthermore people with solar panels still need grid power. So grid power is a necessity in the solar era just as it was before. But look at the economics of grid power in the solar space.<p>First, let&#x27;s look at a solar power plant. Before it&#x27;s built it will sign long-term power delivery contracts for, let&#x27;s say 50-80% of it&#x27;s capacity. That&#x27;s what finances the construction. This means 50-80% of the power generation capacity never enters the market at all, and powers, say, an apple datacenter, and never anything else. Not good for electricity producers, but impact is limited. Then there&#x27;s the rest. They may sign a few more contracts, but really the majority overflow capacity is going to the spot market. What happens on the spot market ?<p>Well : marginal cost of producing available electricity for a solar power plant = nil, zero, nada. Now wait, why not maintenance ? Well, solar panels need maintenance whether or not they&#x27;re in use, since weather is responsible for most of the damage. There&#x27;s going to be some amount, but ... it&#x27;s more or less zero (and has been calculated into those construction contracts anyway). This means when solar panels are working (ie. the day, when industrial customers use electricity), grid power&#x27;s price is going towards zero. Great, right ? Well ...<p>Now of course during the night you can&#x27;t buy solar power at any price. So you have to buy them from traditional power plants. At what price ? Well since these plants can&#x27;t quickly shut down (meaning they have a few hours where they have to compete with solar power&#x27;s 0 price) it&#x27;s going to be a factor > 1, because you need to pay for the fact that they have to destroy electricity during the day. For coal and nuclear it&#x27;s going to be at least 3-4 (since they can&#x27;t shut down or even throttle back at all, that was never designed into most of the existing plants, they were designed baseload generators). 3-4 ? Yes, given lots of solar, you can expect power to be available in most places for ~16 hours.<p>So calculate. If you buy power during the night, it costs the utility 3x the price it does now to provide that power (once for the power you actually use, twice for the power they need to destroy during the daytime when they can&#x27;t compete with solar).<p>So if solar power is allowed to work the market without interference, then here&#x27;s the result : during the day (ie. when people don&#x27;t generally need it if they have a job), electricity is effectively free. During the night it will cost 5x the current day price or more (in some locales 20x has been observed due to a few factors), and due to an inverse Jevon&#x27;s paradox, this will lead to existing plants closing, meaning after sufficient time passes, no power will be available at all during the night.<p>There is the additional problem that utilities&#x27; contracts generally do not allow for unlimited price difference between day and night. So, on those contracts, electricity prices would have to double or triple due to the presence of solar elsewhere on the market ... Do we want that ? I&#x27;d say no. Even where you do have separate pricing for day/night, would you really want to pay 20x more during the night ? I&#x27;m thinking, again, no you don&#x27;t.<p>And most people don&#x27;t have a choice, not having the money do install solar panels (yes, most, look at average income in America, cost of solar panels + installation and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s more than 50%. If you allow the market to force people to work with batteries, it&#x27;s going to be worse).<p>These taxes are being introduced to prevent that from happening. Is that unreasonable ? No (in my humble opinion). They have to get a whole lot bigger to have the desired effect (stable 24h power at a reasonable price). I would expect these taxes to get a whole lot bigger, and for people to start taxing solar panels whether or not they&#x27;re grid connected.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily putting forth a position for or against these taxes, but if you&#x27;re not looking from a strictly individualist point of view (with the individual quite rich ...) there is a very good case to be made here. The extreme interpretation is that without government interference, solar power will take grid electricity away from the poor, due to a 5x or larger price increase.",1398654759

Not easier to write per se, but easier to reason about.<p>* JavaScript was, as far as I can tell, arguably the first truly mainstream language to embrace first-class functions and closures. The ubiquity of JavaScript has exposed many to the benefits of such an approach. Similarly, Rails and other Ruby-based software make lots of use of functional programming through Ruby&#x27;s do-blocks. These languages have made people more comfortable with first-class functions.<p>* Languages like Haskell, Scala and Clojure have shown that functional programming can be high-performance and one need not necessarily trade speed for expressiveness. Similarly, many scripting languages (and/or the hardware they run on) have become fast enough to allow for them to be used for high-performance applications.<p>* Functional programming is fun, and allows for beautiful and succinct code.",1398654581

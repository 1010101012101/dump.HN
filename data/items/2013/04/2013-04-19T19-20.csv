In fact, in my top post I talked about a very particular combination of different things that make _why unique. I still stand by the hypothesis that _why was (at least one of) the first artist(s) to show such a combination in his artwork.<p>Of course there were lots of people before _why thinking about and expressing the relationship between art and programming. There were also lots of people thinking about teaching children just for recreative purposes (Alan Kay comes to mind as the most prominent example). There were lots of people fusing emotions with programming, in fact every act of coding is very emotional. I never said anything to the contrary and so I cannot see how you arrive at phrases like ""mindless, emotionless robot"".<p>Individual contributions such as the poignant guide, Shoes and even TryRuby are not really that important in my opinion, neither are they unique to _why. As I said, it's not _whys code that matters (to me). But rather _why's whole collection of ""stuff"" is so much more than a bunch of random things, it is a very coherent (funny to say that in the context of _why...) artistic opus with a clear signature and an artist's style.

His genius did wonders for Apple but the same concepts failed with a different industry in his tenure with JCPenney. There's no silver bullet, and what Mayer's doing with Yahoo may have some similarities with what was done early on with Google, but in order to cement Yahoo's independent identity, she's going to have to pursue some goals that aren't identical to things she's done before.<p>Ending WFH is perhaps a start.

So no, if you keep on adding conditions why nobody was like him or even crafting 'art' you can easily exclude the rest of the world and maintain your claim.

I wouldn't blame that on the community, actually; that's all my fault. :-)<p>Let me argue from a different, slightly better-thought-out angle. It's not that no programmers do artistic things. Indeed, there are fascinating people using code pretty much everywhere, and there have been for decades. What made _why unique was that many of his projects were aimed at introducing new people to programming, in a plethora of different ways which felt more organic and intimate than your average ""learn to code"" resource. Codecademy, which enjoyed a tremendous success over the last year, struck me as a slightly less whimsical version of _why's TryRuby, which always struck me as particularly ingenious.<p>Plenty of interesting programmers don't concern themselves much with reading out to amateurs, whereas _why had the (Poignant) Guide and TryRuby and Shoes. And _why wrote, not just about the code itself, but about the culture; some of the most interesting parts of the (Poignant) Guide concerned not the Ruby language, but the Ruby culture, which he made out to be particularly enthusiastic and welcoming.

At the same time, the things he said which were critical about the community rang true with those of us who didn't feel like proper parts of it  I, as I've already admitted, am not really a programmer and my approaches to building things tend to run contrary to how most programmers work. Yet with him, and with people who were especially inspired by his work, my way of doing things has felt like a valid and worthwhile approach to making things, and I've been able to feel like a bit more part of a community because of it.<p>I wish there were more people like _why doing that.

More concretely, I would exclude any works that simply praise mathematical / structural elegance, perfection or purity. Even though their creators may be artists and use artistic methods, I would hesitate to call such works ""Art"" with a capital A.<p>So, games/demos/processing sketches/audi-visual programming/software patterns/etc all do not fit these criteria. They may be very skillful works of art, but none of them tackle the subject of software & code at their core.

The number of people working on this case professionally is/was staggering. Usually, though, it's a town detective that's got 20 cases open, and a few free eyeballs can definitely be of huge benefit.<p>Some professional processes appear not to work well under this environment, too. For one, professional investigators compile a list of everyone who could be a suspect, and then disqualify them methodically and quickly. The reddit discussions established many potential suspects, but had no real way to disqualify them. The unfortunate result is that news media picked this up and the disqualifications came from public statements -- definitely not the way such a thing should work, and having your name publicly attached to a crime is really terrible. I'm not happy this happened, and I place blame primarily on the people who didn't bother to look at what was happening and instead took a picture with a box around someone as an indication that they were a suspect. Instead, it was just a picture meant to draw attention to something that seems suspicious for discussion, for cross references with other images, and with potential information people have that could be forwarded to the FBI as a tip.<p>It also definitely showed that there's a very high noise to signal ratio in this, most likely due to the chaotic nature of an open forum like reddit.

The problem is that you cannot afford to be on this ship. If you had the resources to stick around then it could be different. Being able to take on more debt does not mean you can do this. Don't set yourself back 3-4 years because you feel you owe the startup anything. At this point, they are not keeping up their end of the deal.

Is it shared pain?  Or... are you the only one who is under pain?  Or under-paid?<p>I've seen startup situations where the CEO earns > $250k but pays everyone else < $100k.  And says there isnt enough money.  But the truth is the CEO himself is squeezing the company dry and killing it.  Are you in that kind of company?<p>Another thing to consider, are the founders ethical?  Are they good people?   Have you considered if they are sociopaths?  Read: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad</a><p>The reality for me is that I would never ever ever take a startup job less than break-even cash.  That means I am not paying for my day-to-day living out of savings while taking a substandard salary.  Because in a properly backed startup, they CAN afford to pay people $120k a year.  If you are taking major cash hits, you need to be a founder.<p>On the founder side, it's a pretty clear cut rule... are you a founder - if the answer isnt ""yes"" immediately, without a doubt, the answer is in fact NO.  First employees arent founders.  Employees with stock options (ISO or otherwise) arent founders.  ""VP of X"" or ""Director of Y"" - not a founder.  ""But I did the technical due diligence"" - not a founder.<p>Being a founder in major part is also about how the other founders treat you.  Are you an equal business partner?  Usually if you were hired in substantially after, the answer is NO.  They might respect your opinion, but also reserve the right to ignore it.  Real founders and partners don't get to ignore the other's opinion without consequences later on.  This is true in business and your personal life as well.<p>In short, if your founders are the Dark Triad type, you may wish to extract yourself.  If they are not, you may be able to come clean with them, and come to a negotiated situation.  Such as allowing you to find consulting work, or perhaps paying you more, etc.<p>Good luck!",1366398631

Once you're able to do transparent tcp handoffs your ability to exploit unlicensed spectrum to offload traffic from your saturated licensed bands without a very obvious service interruption gets much easier. If you deploy devices set to auto associate with a whitelisted set of provider and partner hotspots as soon as the connection is up you can offload the bulk of it, letting you serve more customers with the same amount of spectrum. Addressing heavy demand locations with wifi is way cheaper than minicells or DAS systems and wouldn't involve any regulatory approval or backhaul requirements.<p>I had to laugh when I saw the charts of LTE+wifi beating wifi alone in throughput. Even if the phone os was setup to try to exploit that, any wireless provider able to tie their own shoelaces is going to monitor multipath traffic like that and once they infer your alternate link is reasonably fast they'll start intentionally congesting their side of the path to force the bulk onto the local route.<p>I wonder what sort of additional profiling this could enable. Right now my phone is on 3g and my dual homed wifi network. It seems possible that being able to see my traffic from wireless, wireline ip4 and via my ip6 tunnel provider at the same time along with each path's latency would leak more data than existing hard handoffs.",1366398530

It encourages engineers to build profitable companies rather than get big or go home (VC).<p>Itll encourage mid-growth companies. See: bit.ly/16guxvy. I want this thing to generate some Real Technology, and focus on hard problems instead of social media bullshit optimized for instant results. Its for the mid-risk 10-40%/year growth range thats underserved by existing finance.<p>An Autonomy Funds like so: engineers get a base salary (say $125k) and the investors get a percentage (say 37.5%) of any profits they make. What do they work on? Whatever they want. Their own projects. Consulting. Startups. The fund owns part of it, but they have full autonomy over what they do.<p>One idea here is self-organization. If two teams decide to work together and pool resources, they can. Since they're collectives of autonomous individuals, they don't need to worry about the (morale-killing) processes of merging HR structures and org charts. They just pull together and work.<p>Whod fund it? I think local governments might. (Am I right? Or off the mark?) It creates jobs, supports local businesses, and may build the next Facebook.<p>I see this as the ultimate symbiosis between cities and tech. They want to make their cities tech hubs instead of having all the action go to star cities. Wed vet programmers, something a non-programmer can't (cf. Design Paradox).<p>I'd aim for top-5% 10Xers, with initial class size ~28 and a 2-year initial runway ($7 million). If the pilot succeeded, then similar funds could be launched all over the world, and there might be a business in setting cities up with their own Autonomy Funds.<p>Is this something that:<p>(a) local governments would support, and<p>(b) a substantial number of top-5% people would join, even if it meant moving to a small city (~50-250k inhabitants)?",1366398465

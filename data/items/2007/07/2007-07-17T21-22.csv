Does the use of these fancy flash pages create value for your website? Only if it's a particularly creative website e.g. bands. ",1184709396
34879,comment,34401,34698,0,0,sbraford,,,"Having a bit of reserves in the bank before applying / getting into YC seems like it'd be a major help.<p>Although it appears that many YC startups haven't had any trouble getting angel funding after their initial funding runs out.  Just traditionally it can take many months to raise funding (while being distracted from making the product better), no?",1184709281

34875,comment,34619,34668,0,0,sbraford,,,"ok - here's one.<p>just like with _any_ other language, if you are not careful you can end up writing some sloppy RoR code.<p>especially once you get into the 50-100+ migrations apps - your first few might suck unless you have some good guidance on how to do the more advanced things.<p>as a corollary - I just joined a RoR startup and by the end of my first day I had already closed out 2-3 feature/bug tickets, mostly because the code was clean & well-structured.  in some heavier environments I remember it taking a few days just to get your system setup & figuring out how to navigate / compile / etc. all the code.",1184708894

34872,comment,34461,34461,0,0,geebee,,,"I know I'm chiming in very late here.  The original post asked if it is ""bad if I don't want to work at a C++/Java startup.""<p>Of course not.  This thread has turned it around a bit - phrasing the question as if you wanted to work for a C++/Java startup (or at least if you felt neutral about it).<p>I'm not surprised that's what's being discussed, because those are the more interesting questions.  But if you feel in your gut that you don't want to work in C++ or Java, then for god's sake man, don't do it.  You'll be really unhappy, and I'm sure you'll have other opportunities.  ",1184706859
34871,comment,34841,34841,0,0,tx,,,"Notice how DB-centric that guy is. That is exactly why I disguise SQL-servers and prefer to keep everything (well... as much as possible) written in one language (Ruby) and this is precisely what Rails is good at.<p>DB performs two very-very boring actions: it only <i>stores</i> and <i>retreives</i> data for you. Definitely not the most exciting things a software hacker dreams of. One very smart guy once called all databases ""toilets where we keep our @#it, I prefer less primitive activities"".<p>Rails tries as much as possible to relief a programmer from this repetitive #@it-taking exercise.

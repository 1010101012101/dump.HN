My own observation is that ""The Law"" (that class of people in charge of creating, extending and defending laws and legal systems) in the USA has crawled inside itself. The legalists like your patent lawyer and others will give very persuasive and logical arguments for laws and the current implementaton of laws.  Unfortunately, the non-logical axioms and symbols they start with are all legal. The Law has come unstuck from reality.

2873756,comment,2872597,2872597,71,0,Dove,,,"I find the discussion surrounding the XKCD strip alarming for the superstition it reveals about password generation.  The particular theme I am alarmed by is that people seem to think that if a password <i>looks</i> alien, or was difficult for <i>them</i> to come up with, it will be hard for a machine to guess.<p>Look, we're working with big numbers here.  You need to do the math.<p>In this thread alone, I've seen suggestions to use a common dictionary word translated into another language, or written in l33tsp34k with some permutations.  From a probabilistic perspective, <i>these are still dictionary words</i>, even though they look like gibberish.  The same is true of the common method of typing a word with ones fingers displaced on the keyboard.<p>Conversely, I see a lot of argument that these XKCD passphrases would be easy to guess because they are made up of dictionary words.  This misunderstands the math behind the situation.  Even if an attacker knows that your password was generated via this method, and <i>even if they know the word list you used</i>, the password is still hard to guess.  The difficulty grows exponentially with each word in the phrase, and that's pretty fast.<p>The key with passwords is not to create something that <i>looks</i> random -- something that if you showed it to another human being, they'd have a hard time deciphering.  It's to create something that <i>is</i> random; literally a result of a throw of the dice for every new password.<p>Human beings are really bad at creating randomness.  There's a demonstration done in an early statistics class in which the professor divides the class into two groups.  He tells one to toss a coin a hundred times and record the sequence of heads and tails, while the others are to write down a sequence they think is random using their imagination.  The papers are completed and mixed and then -- magically! -- he is able to sort them into the two types, easily and with high accuracy.<p>The lesson is this: even when you think you're being random, you probably aren't.  You're probably using the same tricks everyone else is, and making the same mistakes.<p>I would trust passwords that come out of a script like this to be <i>far</i> more secure than passwords anyone (myself included) made up, no matter how random they're trying to be.",1313082274

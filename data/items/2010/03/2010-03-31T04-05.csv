You wouldn't store it in your database, but you might want to make use of it in a document editor, for example, to speed up search+replace type operations.<p>UTF-16 is still substantially more heavyweight than UTF-8, but it can't be optimized into straight memory cells like UTF-32 without breaking the spec. So - unless your needs are extremely specific and you discover a sweet spot in UTF-16 after extensive profiling - it's just not a likely candidate.",1270011584

1230948,comment,1230768,1230921,0,0,jerf,,,"""Except URI's aren't uniform.""<p>Sure they are! They're structured data serialized to a binary blob that claims to be a string but contains no encoding indication with guidance given by an internet standard for the contents of the string before the first colon but no guidance whatsoever after that! What's not uniform about that?<p>Normally I wouldn't be so pedantic but at the point where you're talking about ""mysql://myuser:mypass@db8.myhost.com:3306/mydatabase"" as if it's some sort of solution to a problem you've really dropped the ball.<p>URLs are only meaningful in a given semantic context. ""http"" and ""https"" are meaningful because we all agree what they mean (see RFCs below). ""git"" is meaningful-ish because there's only one thing that plausibly can be said to give a definition, but your application does not magically gain any understanding of the subsequent what-might-as-well-be-a-binary-blob merely by virtue of sticking ""git:"" in front of it. ""mysql"" is simply meaningless. I use Perl and therefore DBI and I observe that it too has a sort of ""mysql URL"" but it looks nothing like Ruby's. Uniformity is relatively to a <i>universal</i> agreement about what it means, and mysql lacks that. For that matter, git may very well lack it in the future, if someone implements other gits (and I've seen attempts). Without that universal agreement, you don't have a URL. You can't make a URL by fiat.<p>For non-standard URLs, what follows the colon... and for that matter what precedes it... is nothing more and nothing less than a binary blob in a constrained character set. And this article should be treated exactly as if it were an article about how all your resource location problems go away if you just express them in terms of opaque binary blobs, because once you leave http and https behind, that is what you are doing. Not ""like"" what you are doing, it <i>is</i> what you are doing, full stop. It may work for you and it may work for your friends, but that is not by the magic of calling your binary blob a URL, it is by the magic of agreeing to a way to interpret bits, and that's hardly any sort of breakthrough.<p>(Just to be clear, this is vehement agreement that acknowledges that you got to this point first.)<p>By the way, since I can already guess that someone will reply with something like m0th87's point, I invite you to read the URL RFC: <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt</a> But read it <i>carefully</i>, for what it <i>actually mandates</i>. Section 2.2: ""<i>Many</i> URL schemes reserve certain characters for a special meaning""... none of them are universal to URLs, they are all scheme-specific, which means you can't trust their meaning in undefined schemes. Section 2.3: ""<i>Some URL schemes</i> ... contain names that can be considered hierarchial""... / doesn't have a universal meaning, it's relative to the scheme. 3.1 describes the double-slash, which I can now say I've seen used incorrectly in both directions. Section 3.5 defining ""mailto:"" observes that URLs aren't even necessarily resources. (Section 3.10, file URLs defined in a way that violates the earlier discussion of double-slash. I understand why, but it's still a violation.)<p>And if you want to talk URI (<a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt</a> ), section 3 starts right off with ""The URI syntax is dependent upon the scheme.""",1270011319

Banks are a major part of our economy, and shouldn't be allowed to make so many risky investments.<p>The risky investments were pretty much mandated by the regulators that you think will protect us.<p>Banks must have reserve capital.  The regulators encouraged banks to hold lots of Fannie and Freddie stock by treating it specially for the purposes of reserves.  As a result, Fannie and Freddie tanking pushed many banks into technical insolvency.  (This isn't the last time Fannie and Freddie will make an appearance.)<p>Regulators also granted a monopoly on bond rating to Moody's and a couple of other companies.  Oops - they were wrong.<p>Regulators also pushed securitization of mortgages to help boost the housing market.  They wanted banks to hold such securities as reserve and wanted that to be seen as safe.  Their solution, insurance, as sold by AIG, which was heavily regulated.<p>And, remember Fannie and Freddie?  They lied about the loans in their pools, so no one knew how much of the market was subprime.

I don't think it's been long enough for the full economic effects to have been realized, but, if you believe the hype, a major crisis was averted.  IMO, the bailout was a necessary band-aid solution, although you can't keep on doing it.<p>I think a better solution is stronger regulation of banks.  Banks are a major part of our economy, and shouldn't be allowed to make so many risky investments.  They can't ""print money"" if we carefully regulate the types of investments they can enter into.  That strategy seems to have worked out for Canada.<p>I know Americans are generally against regulation, but I think that, absent government regulation, banks would need to maximize short-term gain, even at the risk of a crash in the future.  People put their money in whichever bank offers the highest return.  If Bank A has a bunch of risky investments, which will crash in 10 years but give a good payout until then, they can offer higher interest rates than their more conservative competitors.  Competitor B would be forced to adapt, because its depositors will probably be gone within 10 years.<p>Another idea is progressive taxation for banks: Tax the big banks more than smaller banks.  That would create an economic incentive for smaller banks, and banks are less likely to get ""too big to fail.""

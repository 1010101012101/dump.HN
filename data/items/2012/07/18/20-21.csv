REALLY?</i><p>You have calculated the odds of <i>any given</i> individual creating a documentary about going on a high-fat diet and having a genetic mutation.  However the claim you are trying to refute is that <i>this particular</i> individual has a genetic mutation.  Since this particular individual is <i>known</i> to have made a documentary about themselves going on a high-fat diet, you must instead look at the conditional probability.<p>It is likely that making a documentary about going on a high-fat diet is totally uncorrelated with having a genetic mutation.  This means that the probability of this person making a documentary about going on a high-fat diet is divided out of the final probability, which reduces simply to the probability that they have a genetic mutation.<p>Of course it could be possible that making such a documentary is negatively correlated with having a mutation, in which case your point stands.  However I highly doubt this is the case.<p>However it could also be the case that making such a documentary is positively correlated with having a mutation, in which case your point is moot.  It is more likely that this is the case, as this particular individual may have known beforehand that his body dealt well with fat; also, other individuals may have made a similar documentary but never published it because the outcome (getting fat) was as expected.",1342643649

In theory conferences, it is given to a paper who's all authors are full-time students. In systems conferences, it is given to a paper who's first author is a full-time student. So best student papers in theory conferences are particularly good reflectors of an institution's merit and should be included.<p>- A thought/idea: Most top conferences in CS tend to have inner cliques.

If anything, being born poor and white can be <i>more</i> difficult because people bitch about your ""privilege"" each time you ask for the slightest degree of help.<p>If you're poor and white, you're pretty much screwed when it comes to being able to afford colleges. Most scholarships serve people that belong to a certain (non-white) race, religious, or military background. You don't get access to any tutoring and you're usually working after school to help support your family, so it's borderline impossible to get a 4.0 GPA and even begin qualifying for non-racial scholarships.<p>Outside of racial profiling within America's law enforcement (which is a huge, huge, huge problem that desperately needs to be fixed), there's really no ""white privilege"" in America. It's ""high-income privilege."" Anybody born of a wealthy family has a chance, and anybody who isn't suffers.

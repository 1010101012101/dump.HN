2605399,comment,2604264,2605339,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I don't think the problem of higher education is affordability, there are more bachelor/master/phd graduates than ever. The problem is the content, and the methodology. A great deal of college comes down to little more than: read a book, do some exercises, and then tests to verify you learned what was in the book. But much of that is at the wrong level, too much breadth, not enough actual mastery of the fundamentals. The result is CS graduates who struggle on anything other than non-trivial programming projects, or chemistry graduates who don't understand that the bulk of the weight of a piece of wood comes from CO2.<p>Sadly, most of the ""value"" of college today is due to the failure of high schools. If you require a basic level of literacy, numeracy, computer literacy, etc. you have to set your level at college graduates, since a HS diploma no longer guarantees such skills.",1306889871
2605398,comment,2604264,2605339,5,0,joshkaufman,,,"To do what you suggest would require a massive restructuring of the entire US university system, and the governmental systems that continuously feed it easy money. There's a <i>reason</i> why college costs go up as federal educational dollars increase.<p><i>Colleges don't care what you major in, as long as the dollars flow.</i> Colleges have absolutely no incentive to provide educational experiences that are useful in the working world, since the money is already in the bank account. They have every incentive to maximize enrollments [1] and keep students enrolled as long as possible, while reducing costs via cheap graduate student labor.<p>Colleges also have every incentive to massage outcomes statistics to keep federal dollars flowing. When a student defaults on a loan, the college doesn't bear the brunt of the impact - it's the responsibility of the government, and therefore, the taxpayer.<p>""Fixing"" the college system, as you suggest, would require eliminating many administrators and/or substantially reducing their salaries, structuring departments based on market demand vs. academic interest (no more liberal arts), and largely eliminating federal subsidies for academic research, student loans, and grants.<p>You can bet that every single individual involved in credentialing as it presently exists will fight those changes to their dying breath. Since being ""strong on education"" gets politicians elected, this faction will find it easy to maintain political support.<p>Personally, I think this sentiment sums up the alternative approach:<p>""You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."" - Buckminster Fuller<p>Employers don't NEED people with college educations. They need employees with economically valuable skills.

Society is a machine that trains worker ants for roles in production which serves the goals of the society. The efficient operation of this machine requires that intellectual knowledge workers be identified, tested, corralled into specialties with a certification which is accurate and uniform so that factories can employ known quality product cogs to place in their production lines.<p>2. People are stupid and lazy and do not like to learn things. College forces them to learn things so they will not be so stupid no more.<p>3. People need specific technical skills and training to do technical jobs from nursing to product design. Colleges need to provide uniform quality vocational training to accomplish this end.<p>He also dismisses much of the research that shows colleges do not teach much critical thinking by suggesting that if a measurement gives a surprising result, the measurement is wrong since we know the result should be otherwise.<p>These are the arguments of a desperate man who does not understand humans or what education is.<p>This all said, I was fascinated and amazed that his three reasons for college match up with the criticism of educational reformers such as John Gatto, who argues that the <i>problem</i> with contemporary education is that it trains factory workers, performs vocational education and assumes people hate learning and must be forced to learn things when in fact people actually are built to learn and will pursue it naturally unless their spirit is crushed by institutionalized forced schooling.",1306888194

If all of this is actually true (I'm not 100% sure it is), then it's certainly not on the level ""actual spammers"" perform at. Spam is basically unwanted and harmful advertising, and nobody complains when someone gets e-mailed an actual useful relevant thing out of nowhere. If the thing you're being e-mailed <i>is more relevant than the ads GMail is showing you</i> then I'm not sure you have a right to complain too much.

Young commis chefs start with learning products and techniques by doing the low-level prep work. After that's mastered, they graduate to garde-manger where they generally are in charge of cold apps, soups and sometimes more. Not only does this expand their technique repertoire and palate but it introduces the concept of being responsible for your dishes, with no excuses. This continues around every station, with the cook learning more and being responsible for more as they continue.<p>While this is hard to reproduce exactly in a tech startup, it certainly wouldn't be hard to take on an apprentice who starts at the bottom and learns the basics under the mentorship of a more experienced developer while learning more and taking more on.",1306886489

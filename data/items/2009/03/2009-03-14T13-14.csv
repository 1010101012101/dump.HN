Maybe I just don't get it (or haven't figured it out), but when I have 20 windows open on then Mac, trying to figure out what is what in the dock is painful (all of the terminal windows look the same in icon form).  I find it much easier to jump between apps using the Windows task bar.",1237039173

515845,comment,515626,515681,0,0,jsdalton,,,"There was a discussion here last week about technical debt, and I think this is a great example of it.<p>You incur debt when you make a decision like this one. When you make thousands of decisions like it, they add up to a whole lot of debt.<p>The problem is that this debt is nearly impossible to quantify, so it's often invisible to the business team. A decision like keeping two copies of Notebook around thus <i>seems</i> like the correct decision to the business team at the time, but later proves to cost a lot more down the road.<p>So while it's true that engineering supports business objectives at the macro level, a pure ""business"" mindset at the micro level can lead to short-sighted and ultimately costly decisions like this one.",1237038097

515843,comment,515842,515842,0,0,johnm,,,"I particularly like the shifting of focus onto the notion of relationships.<p>If I may, I'd also point out that qualities such as ""quality"", the values embodied by practices, and the evolving nature of relationships over time all come down to intent. Amongst other things, without a clean connection to intent those other things devolve into static, abstract notionals devoid of life.",1237037828

515837,comment,515654,515755,0,0,bemmu,,,"I had two of those badge apps. One of those apps was making around $2000/day for a time, then $100/day after the changed profile and lowered CPMs. I sold that app so I can't really know, but I think it would be making even less now. Am I angry / disappointed? Not so much. That would be like winning the lottery twice in a row, and then being upset when you don't win for a third time. The app took almost no effort to create initially, although getting it to scale was an interesting challenge.<p>Now developers will need to come up with things that are more compelling, and this will bring better experiences to the users. Not that people were somehow coerced or spammed to install my badges. They spread by people noticing the badges on their friends' profiles, and installing them from there. Loyalty in Google Analytics showed a lot of people visiting regularly to tweak the layout of their badge, and I got a lot of nice feedback.<p>The company that I most look up to with admiration is Playfish. Those guys really know how to create experiences that are genuinely fun, but still viral enough to spread. I wish one day I will be skilled enough to be able to come up with apps that have quality matching what they offer.",1237036954

No patterns in the data means no predictability. You can have the coolest, most hyper-intelligent system ever devised, but that cannot see patterns which do not exist. Of course market data has patterns (sell on Friday, for instance), but it is always limited. Generally, I think you could even in principle never get more than 80% accuracy with any kind of neural network, because of the lack of complete patterns in market data, whether we are talking about a rat or a human or a whatever kind of neural network. Which brings me to a second point, since 100% accuracy or anywhere near that is not possible even in principle, applying electric shocks to test subjects when they are wrong is simply cruel and irresponsible.",1237036595

63801,comment,63651,63651,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"Apple is a company that's meant to be marginalized. They have decided a long time ago, before most of the folks that's buying their stuff was ever born, to position themselves in a certain way. The Ferrari or computers. The Bugatti of design. People just don't get it. You buy it or don't. Their business model works regardless. <p>But complaining sure is fun right? You stood in line for 8 hours to buy an iPhone? And you call yourself an Apple loyalist? Ha! I have a Lisa. And I refuse to let it die. I'm a loyalist. ",1191620471

Increasingly, people with goods to sell set up their own websites and find buyers by advertising on Google's search pages. Google has also begun offering online payment and telephone services that compete directly with PayPal and with Skype.""</i><p>Can Google <i>really</i> dominate all those different areas? The current media certainly seems to think so.",1191619594
63798,comment,63758,63796,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I wouldn't say they were implying Google is omnipotent. The following quote from the article pretty much paints Google in the stupid corner as well:<p>""By buying Skype, the internet phenomenon of 2005, eBay started a bubble. Google, with its purchase of YouTube, the cyber-star of 2006, inflated it further. And Microsoft and Google now appear tempted to add more froth by investing a silly sum in Facebook, the latest big thing.""<p>I just think Google has recently outmaneuvered its opponents (ebay/yahoo/microsoft) and the press coverage reflects that it's temporarily the top dog.",1191619434
63797,comment,63617,63791,0,0,edw519,,,"""Scientists do not know why the brain starts to slow down past a certain age.""<p>SOME scientists don't.  Many do.  It's called lifestyle.<p>Lay off the drugs, eat cleanly, stay active, and live right, and your body can easily serve you just as well as you age.  Unfortunately, most Americans are counterexamples to this.  Aging doesn't cause us to slow down and lose our health, poor living does, at any age.  I have friends and relatives in their teens and twenties who can't do a single pull-up, a single push-up, or carry their own luggage throught the airport.  Many in their twenties are balding or have gray hair and can barely make it up a flight of stairs.  OTOH, I play bridge with some seniors in their nineties who are as sharp as tacks.  Still.<p>Discrimination based on age is stupid and illegal.<p>And at a time when anyone can publish anything anywhere, it's a good idea to take all health advice on the internet with a grain of salt.  For every study you cite, I can probably google another one with the opposite point of view.<p>Still wanna race me to those donuts?<p>Or we can webboggle.shackworks.com.  I like the 5x5 board.  I'll spot you 5 years, er I mean, points.

63795,comment,63138,63787,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"Just to reiterate, an idea that goes from 100% to 25% based solely on Paul Graham is not a good idea.<p>To restate the original point: I feel like some of the people on this forum approach starting a business the same way they approach applying to college, or to grad school. That is not how it works. Your success is not gated on the ""grownups"" in the admissions office, or the department, or Y Combinator, making a decision about you.<p>If you catch yourself thinking about it that way, stop. Even if you get your 2 month's consulting dollars out of Y Combinator, nothing else in business works that way. There's no professorship to apply to once you get funded. You actually have to engage the market and win.

Between having to drive forever to get anywhere in dense traffic, the intense smog, and the lack of a cultural core - it made for a terrible experience.<p><i>San Francisco</i>, on the other hand, is hard to beat.",1191618820

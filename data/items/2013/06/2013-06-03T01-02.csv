But I cut him much less slack than I was given as a kid.<p>School is often arbitrary, pointless, and tedious. It's part of a large system that needs to serve many different interests, several of them legitimate. That's modern life. We're not so much beset by wolves and bears; instead, we have to deal with systems and social/cultural obligations. And while I don't so much care if the boy emerges from high school remembering all the Latin declensions or the details of the Treaty of Ghent, he's at least going to be familiar with what it takes to play the system.<p>For whatever it's worth: when I pay attention to his homework, I rarely find it pointless. And in the classes most imperiled by pointlessness, there homework usually takes the form of essays. And there is nothing in the world more valuable than being able to express ideas in writing. So he writes the essays, and I make him do drafts and drafts and drafts.",1370224794

5810902,comment,5806970,5808323,2,0,taliesinb,,,"1. Parametric polymorphism may still come. I think we need to understand their connection with interfaces and builtins before it will be clear what to do. A thousand frameworks may need to bloom before we have enough data to do that.<p>2. Nullability IS a kind of sum... and the idea of a zero value would be impossible (or at least ruinously inefficient) without nullability. Secondly, the fact that all dereferences are checked gives you most of the same benefits, just minus all the type noise.<p>3. Products for errors are actually a GOOD thing, in that they allow developers to easily choose between pedantic error handling or relying on downstream panicing to handle situations that are unrecoverable anyway. Whereas with type-level enforcement, you HAVE to do all that extra checking, and that straitjacket costs you clarity and elegance.<p>4. Interfaces do allow for sum types, and type switch statements and/or dispatch allow for pattern matching. Not terribly elegant, but effective and understandable.<p>My closing thought: type systems are crutches for reasoning about the behavior of programs at compile time... and we need all the help we can get with that challenge, so yay for type systems!<p>At some point, however, they become cages, because there will always be a frontier beyond which they will be unable to encode contraints that are obvious to the person writing the program, and at that point, the resulting contortions will obscure, not enlighten.",1370224650

People who have pieces of paper with high numbers on them <i>and</i> are actually good, can easily find jobs.<p>Which, unless you are Google or Fog Creek, probably means they <i>already have</i> jobs. Very few employers get to cherry-pick from all the world, those candidates with the highest perceived desirability. The vast majority will be looking at applications from candidates whose perceived desirability was slightly lower.<p>The question you should ask yourself is, would you rather hire someone whose perceived desirability was slightly lower because of the lack of a piece of paper with high numbers on it, or because of actual inability to do the job?",1370224397

5810876,comment,5806583,5806583,1,0,austinz,,,"I'm 25 as well. I share a bit of my own experience, in the hopes that you may find lessons (both positive and negative) from it. I don't pretend that anyone should consciously follow the path I took, but it did work out pretty well for me.<p>I graduated college with a degree in electrical engineering not really knowing anything about what I wanted to do for a living or where I wanted to be in five or ten years. So I sort of drifted into a master's program, again in the same field, hoping to figure out what I was doing before I was forced to confront the job market or academia proper.<p>I didn't realize until the second half of my first year at that graduate program that I enjoyed the CS courses I was taking as electives far more than the normal engineering courses. So I ended up taking my second year and throwing all my effort into taking as many CS classes (which were cross-listed departmentally) as I could: operating systems, databases, compilers, etc. I made some stupid mistakes choosing some classes that turned out to be neither interesting nor relevant, and skipping on classes that would have been extremely useful or informative.<p>When I graduated, I took a position at a startup in the area, doing work that fell between the interface of EE and CS. I realized that I wasn't too fond of the work or the company (for various reasons), and so I spent months teaching myself the practical and theoretical stuff I had missed out at school, whether out of inexperience, disinterest, or sheer decision-making ineptitude. Some of this stuff was useful for my position at the time, other topics were completely exploratory in nature. And when I was ready, I started sending out my resume and interviewing for positions. I did get a new job, and I'm a software engineer at a well-regarded mid-size tech company in Silicon Valley right now.<p>Some thoughts regarding your position:<p>- CS is one of the fields with the lowest barrier to self-teaching. You don't need expensive lab equipment or fieldwork - just software, much of which is freely available, an ordinary computer, and enough motivation to actually utilize both.<p>- You don't need a 4 year degree. In the US a lot of schools won't even allow you to enter their bachelors programs if you already have one. A BS would be a waste of your time.<p>- The MS degree isn't a prerequisite. Build something substantial, and people will take notice. If you don't have anything you can show them, the degree can sometimes be useful. I'm not proud of this and it's actually really shitty, but the name of the school on your resume may sometimes make the difference between people taking a look at it and throwing it out (at least from my experience).<p>- If you do go back for formal schooling know what classes you should take, in order to acquire knowledge you need to have. You mention data structures and algorithms in a comment earlier; there are classes which focus on those; there are also classes that focus on discrete math, statistics, and other foundational topics. You should build an OS and a compiler while you're there. I always thought this was a thought-provoking read: <a href=""http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/</a><p>- A lot of MS programs are coursework programs; they've been charitably described as financially lucrative to their host institutions. Mine almost certainly would have qualified (both the EE and CS programs). This is not necessarily poison, but it does mean that if you attend, you should make the most out of the classes you take.<p>- If you are interested in working at certain companies, see if you can get someone to give you an internal referral once you're ready to begin the job application and interview process. A lot of companies (again, this is a controversial topic) seem to give more weight to internal referrals than unsolicited submissions. Contact with most of the companies I was looking at started either when a recruiter reached out, or when I asked someone I knew to put in a word. If you feel that people are loath to consider you due to your late start/lack of formal credentials this may be a way to offset that.<p>Finally, the fact that you are considering this move because of passion, interest, and demonstrated competence bodes really well for you. Best of luck!",1370224152

5810815,comment,5810075,5810426,1,0,tkf,,,"I think ""maximum extensibility"" is not the philosophy of Emacs.  Remember how long it took to have FFI support in Emacs (it was discussed in the article).  Also, even with FFI, it is not possible to load non-free libraries.  I think this shows some discrepancy from the philosophy to achieve ""maximum extensibility"".  I would say GPL does not allow ""maximum extensibility"".<p>So the next question is: does the philosophy the author speaks of matches with the one of GPL, or rather, the one FSF and Stallman have in mind?  Actually, I think these philosophies are different.  If I remember correctly, in Emacs mailing list sometime ago, Stallman rejected idea of adding function to gcc to dump parse tree (or something similar) to use gcc from other software (I can't find the link right now).  This was because non-free software could use gcc via CLI and ""steal"" the data from free software.  Now, although it is the other way around, Emacs can use non-free external program.  It matches with the philosophy by Matsuyama but I doubt that Stallman says it is the philosophy of Emacs.<p>I would say this philosophy is for author of Emacs Lisp program (though this was not what Matsuyama was talking about).  You have many options.  You could choose ""maximum extensibility"" but actually it is not doable due to GPL.  You can follow FSF's philosophy (I am not sure what is it, but I believe there is).  Somewhere in between, there is philosophy proposed by Matsuyama and it reflects current situation of Emacs very well, and I like it.",1370222379

What you need is a combination of:<p>(a) enough technical skills to do a good job, possibly without the kind of peer review and supporting framework you would have as an employee<p>(b) enough business skills and awareness of ""how the game is played"" to handle the commercial side of things and deal with non-technical people working for your clients.<p>These probably depend as much as anything on working in a variety of environments, with a variety of teams, on a variety of projects. In the absence of other factors, like having taken a year out during a degree to work in industry or being a long-term contributor to a major OSS project in your spare time, I'd suggest doing at least 2-3 different jobs as a permie before looking too closely at freelance work, even if you only stay for a year or two at each. This will probably be enough to start to figure out for yourself what works and what doesn't on real projects, and to understand how technical work fits into the bigger picture, and most importantly to figure out a huge amount of stuff you didn't know yet when you graduated and how to continue your professional development indefinitely under your own direction.<p>Obviously some people do go independent much earlier, but IMHO this is almost always a mistake.

Among other uses, zipper types make certain purely functional data structures much more efficient. This is important both for Haskell and ML programmers, and also in situations where you need to leave older versions of a data structure intact, such as when implementing rollback or creating append-only file formats.",1370221758

One of my colleagues made the point that the value of an individual with a high GPA from a four year degree is that you know the person will get done what needs to get done.<p>To have a high GPA, a student needs to finish term papers on subjects they have no interest in, they need to study for exams in language for which they have no intention of using again, he will read books by authors he disagrees with and toil into the night on problem sets that have little perceivable utility.<p>But in the end they will get it done, and if they maintained a high GPA they have shown that he will get it done year over year and always with high quality.<p>So a high GPA often means that they are not lazy and self centered.  It often means a candidate will not sit idle because a task is beneath her, and she will not pigeonhole on a perfecting an ancillary module when there are better things to do.<p>A student who does not do what is required, who would fritter away on self entertainment via music or finger painting is not someone who can be relied on.",1370221727

    makes the simple difficult and the difficult seemingly impossible.

    Friction may be mental, as in indecision over a course of action.
    It may be physical, as in effective enemy fire or a terrain
    obstacle that must be overcome. Friction may be external, imposed
    by enemy action, the terrain, weather, or mere chance. Friction
    may be self-induced, caused by such factors as lack of a clearly
    defined goal, lack of coordination, unclear or complicated plans,
    complex task organizations or command relationships, or
    complicated technologies. Whatever form it takes, because war is a
    human enterprise, friction will always have a psychological as

First of all for both countries there is no evidence that our lending rates would have increase without the 90's austerity, so its actual value was dubious in the first place. Secondly, as nations mostly on the edge of the global financial storm we are not very interesting, we do not have a huge overhang of private debt that has drastically collapsed demand and crushed our tax base. (Canada has a large amount of private debt but since house values have held that debt is not an ""overhang"" it just sitting there, I can't speak for Sweden.)

You say something, people initially hear it straight, but then realize it's ridiculous and you're not being serious, and they find the juxtaposition amusing.<p>If you demarcate such language beforehand with backtalics or <sarcasm> tags, then there is no such juxtaposition and thus no realization.<p>Plus, while difficult, there are ways to hint an intonation in text.<p>I mean, hel-LO, it's so <i>OBvious</i>.",1266108510

I'm not saying that the death of her brother was indeed a murder, but I couldn't help but get a chill when I found out the news later that day. All of the teachers at UAHuntsville have passion about what they do; this is evident especially in the passion that the teachers seem to imbue in us as students. It is saddening to hear that three faculty have been killed, especially since one of those teachers was my own this past semester.",1266108487

As a new start-up without the ability/desire to commit for a year or any credit rating, you are likely to be paying about $6 per Mbps per month.

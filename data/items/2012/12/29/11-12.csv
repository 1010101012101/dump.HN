4981855,comment,4977845,4980209,2,0,pretoriusB,,,"Running ""very smooth for you"" doesn't mean much. For one, it doesn't do much anyway -- some circles, some boxes, some bordes, shape tweening, and a soundtrack. You could do this stuff in 1080p in 10 year old hardware if you did it native. Heck, you could probably even do it in an Amiga 3000 circa 1992. I sure remember an O2 (I think it was called) by SGI doing far more impressive real time stuff in 1996. And that machine had about 1/5 the capabilities of my iPhone.<p>The thing is, it uses quite a lot CPU power for what it does (and no, it's not ""technical issues"" with individual systems: it tends to do so in general in every system), and the animation isn't always smooth and far from 60fps.<p>And the suggestion that he's ""using a browser that doesn't properly support some of the required CSS3 features"" only reinforces his point, that when it comes to web technology it's a large step backwards from what we can achieve in native systems.",1356782362
4981854,comment,4980265,4981270,1,0,snprbob86,,,"Paraphrasing: ""Isn't the logical type, in fact, `:if`?""<p>Yes.<p>Clojure's types are, generally, of the solution domains. The primary solution domain being: computation. That's the domain that <i>all</i> of Clojure built in types belong to.<p>The nature of Clojure and its community discourages the use of platform types for modeling the problem domain. Sometimes using platform types is desirable for optimizations like protocol dispatch and well-known structured fields. However, even when you're doing that, you're still operating in the solution domain. You're making an explicit decision about representation and evaluation: data structures and algorithms.<p>However, any substantial application is going to need some custom code for inspecting and debugging values. You'll wind up designing some schema and writing some custom validation. There can be tools to help you with this: consider XML's (very ugly) XSD schema system. Or consider W3C validators for HTML and CSS. For an example in the OOP world, look at AstValidator.java in the Google Closure code base. You simply can't escape it. A rich, strong type system can give you a leg up and get you 70% of the way there, but it will actively fight you when you want to go the last mile.<p>When and if you need it, you can basically make your own type system, tailored to your application.",1356782318

4981845,comment,4980220,4980220,3,0,drsim,,,"I backed the 'wireless sensor readings to internet' device Twine (<a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/supermechanical/twine-listen-to-your-world-talk-to-the-internet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/supermechanical/twine-li...</a>) so I'm going to put down a couple things about my experience.<p>-- Production delays --\nI waited almost a year longer than expected to get my unit. Because I just wanted to tinker I wasn't bothered. Ninja Blocks say their units are manufactured, just waiting for the enclosures. This might not be a problem for them.<p>-- Battery eaters --\nTwine eats batteries like nobodies business. Two AA batteries last about two weeks. On the forums this seems like the typical experience. Ninja Blocks looks as if the central 'Ninja Block' can be mains powered. But will the wireless sensors have a short battery life?<p>-- Web app --\nTwine has a website that the device must communicate with to report data and push rules to it. There's no (out-of-the-box) way to get it to talk to a local server via a clean API.<p>This was a big disappointment for me mainly because their web app is very limited:\n- No data logging (just reports the latest figure)\n- Rules can just be triggered over thresholds (ie when temperature reaches 20c then X) not when temperature changes\n- For moisture the actual resistance isn't reported, just a wet or dry condition. This renders it useless for plant watering.<p>Twine can make a HTTP request when a rule is tripped. I plan to play with this but it's not that useful if it can't just HTTP request every time a value changes as I wanted to log temperature (plus it's a GET!).<p>The Ninja Blocks apps look better and appear to fill the gap between reading something then doing something. Twine can really only report something (twitter/sms/email/HTTP supported). But I'd caution that until you get your hands a device like this you don't know of its true limitations.<p>-- Sensors --\nI didn't up my kickstarter amount when they announced new sensors. I wish I had, as only the temperature sensor is nearly useful. The other built in sensor is orientation... ? IMHO they should've thrown in the other sensors and maybe upped the price to increase satisfaction.<p>I prefer the sensor pack that ships by default with Ninja Blocks.<p>In spite of the above I'm optimistic about Twine as it really is early days. This space has massive potential if it can break out of communities like ours into the mainstream. I just hope Supermechanical doesn't get distracted and focusses squarely on their flagship product.<p>Ninja Blocks? I won't be ordering but will keep a close eye on what those who receive the first units think. Their approach so far seems to be a better path to market than Twine's crowdfunding and their presentation superior.",1356781963

I wish the plots were not so obvious or the characters were not so cardboard-cutout or with silly motivations or that the film was a bit morally braver.  I might wonder why a lighting decision was made, or I might wonder whether it'd be better without that music.  But I hardly ever think ""This movie would be a better movie if it looked better"".<p>See, for example, Clerks.  That's a lo-fi movie which is significantly enhanced by being lo-fi.  All the slightly wonky acting is excused because the movie reminds us that it was shot on a personal credit-card budget.<p>See also the discussion about ""The Hobbit"" with some people saying the double framerate has made some things ""too realistic"", thus de-immersing them from the experience.<p>> <i>Even the most avid technophiles (broadbandophiles?) among us chuckle to ourselves when we upgrade our connection from 25Mbps to 35Mbps.

MORE IS BETTER!!"" even though it's not true.  Thus, we've ended up with a ""Bandwidth? Bigger number is better! Price? Lower is better!"" even though that says nothing about contention or reliability or fair-use allowances.  We end up with odd situations where a user buys an ""unlimited"" account, manages to get full speed for 8 minutes, and then has their connection throttled for the rest of the month because they've gone over their fair use allowance.

4981807,comment,4980700,4981137,9,0,klodolph,,,"There's an enormous assumption here -- the assumption that we are on a shared memory computer to begin with.  At the lowest level, memory devices are implemented using ""messages"" that go over wires, and locks are implemented on top of that.<p>But it's a feature of small systems that you THINK you have a flat address space and not a message passing system.  CPU cores send messages to L1 caches to fetch memory, and the messages go outward to L2 and RAM, all in hardware.  With a modern OS kernel this message will often be intercepted and fulfilled with disk IO.<p>So if you pretend you have a flat address space you won't be miserable or anything, because the entire system (hardware + software) is designed to make it look that way.<p>Once you get interested in performance details the flat memory space abstraction goes out the window.  L1, L2, RAM, and disk latencies are really message passing latencies for messages passed between physically separate devices.  Designing your algorithm to minimize the number of messages passed between devices (a.k.a. the number of ""cache misses"") will improve its performance.  Optimizations meant to minimize message passing can have unintended consequences.  For example, Linux once allocated memory on the region of RAM closest to the core running the process which requested the memory -- I'm sure it made some benchmarks run faster, but it turned into an absolute disaster for MySQL, because it meant that MySQL would only use one region of RAM.  (Google ""MySQL NUMA"" for the full story.  You can probably imagine most of it if you just think about the consequences of mixing on-die memory controllers with multi-socket systems.)<p>The degree to which the flat memory abstraction applies is related to the size of the system.  An single-core, embedded microcontroller with 256 bytes of RAM really does have a flat address space and you can often count processor cycles just by looking at the assembly, the abstraction is basically perfect.  A modern desktop with a quad-core processor is going to act less like an ideal shared memory machine because the message passing overhead of using contested cache lines can affect performance.  And a world-class super computer might be split into N units of M cards of K chips with L cores on each chip -- the shared memory abstraction will only extend so far before it's all explicit message passing in software.<p>So the real question is not ""how do you plan to write a queue without mutable shared state?""  The real question is, ""How do you implement mutable shared state using messages?""<p>Footnote: I think it's very telling... the shared memory abstraction is so convenient, the work behind the scenes is so good, we almost want to argue and say ""Look, it's shared state, and everybody knows that it's shared state.""

4981798,comment,4980588,4981294,3,0,gizmo686,,,"Consider the pattern of using None (or null) as an error. You want to compute:\nvar x\nx=f(x)\nx=g(x)\nx=h(x)<p>however, if either f,g, or h return None, then the final value of x is None. The standard way of doing this is:\ndef f(x):\nif x==None:\nreturn None\n...<p>The monadic solution is the Maybe monad. Maybe has two constructors, Just(x) and Nothing. The above code would be equivilent to\nvar x\nx=Just(x)\nx=x.apply(f)\nx=x.apply(g)\nx=x.apply(h)<p>The definition of Maybe is pretty simple. The Just object takes a value of a given type, and will run that value through a given function:\nClass Just():\ndef __init__(val):\nthis.val = val<p>def apply(f);\nreturn f(x)<p>The Nothing object is even simpler:\nClass Nothing():\ndef apply(f):\nreturn Nothing()<p>Using this, we can see that in our original example, once one function returns Nothing, we skip all the other functions and end up with Nothing. When a function does return something, it needs to wrap it in Just, so we have:<p>def f(x):\n...\nreturn Just(x)<p>In general, to be a Monad you need to satisfy the type\nclass Monad():\ndef apply(f)<p>Of course, using Monads like this can end up being somewhat messy, so there is much syntactic sugar around them.",1356780156

Typically, I'll use server side helpers to format strings like value with currency, i18n messages, etc, which makes a lot of strings in any JSON document transmitted.<p>The original author made it clear it was not intended for server/client side communication : it's a very specific format intended to offer better performances on very specific use cases (I would rather know how it compares to BSON than to JSON).<p>JSON, on the other hand, is a generalist exchange format.

One change I made after reading this book is to respect the jobs that I took for granted, like the clerk at the checkout counter.

One of the things I had realized beforehand (through many years of struggling with social interaction) that the book also covers is how we all tell a story of our life in which we are the hero, and how we rationalize our actions to fit the story instead of adapting the story to fit the facts.<p><i>Peopleware</i> ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-Second/dp/0932633439"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-S...</a> )<p>The book covers why building software is primarily a people problem, not a technical problem.

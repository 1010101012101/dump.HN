232967,comment,232881,232881,0,0,jm4,,,"Perl is a good language to know. Hear me out before you mod me down into oblivion! I'm not much of a Perl developer. At work I use Java. For personal projects I like to play around with the ""cool"" stuff like Python, Lisp or Ruby. For me, Perl is great for all the stuff in between.<p>For my entire development career, no matter what language I'm using, I've found myself using Perl on almost a weekly basis for little adhoc scripts. Generating test data? Text processing? Quickly automating some tedious task? Perl to the rescue. I guess if you know Ruby or Python you could do the same thing with those, but Perl is almost everywhere and you have all of CPAN at your finger tips.<p>Even though I'm not developing my applications in Perl I consider it one of my most crucial tools that I can't live without. I think every developer should have one of these and with its ubiquity and CPAN, a strong case can be made for Perl.<p>It also doesn't hurt that there are plenty of jobs out there for good Perl developers. We've all seen terrible Perl code and heard the jokes, but the fact is there are some very large Perl projects (some very high profile) being worked on by some smart people. Sure, Perl has its warts, but it's incredibly useful and a little discipline will go a long way.<p>There's my case for a practical language... If you want to learn something that will fundamentally change the way you think about programming then learn Lisp. I read the PG essays, the Eric Raymond stuff, etc. and decided to take a look. Eventually, things just clicked and it gave me a whole new perspective on the languages I already knew.",1214923174

An environment can certainly be mature and commercial quality without being multi-platform.<p>> And comparing what you need to know and set up to start working with open source Lisp and other environments is... not fair.<p>I do wish that SBCL had a ""everything you need to know in 10 minutes or less"", but it comes with ASDF and ASDF-INSTALL pre-configured. I mean, the amount of stuff you need to know to start working with Java is pretty darn daunting as well, given that you need massive assistance frameworks, and there is no good central package repo. The reason more people go into Java is that they have colleges introducing them to it.<p>Yes, more could be done. But I think commercial, professional work is possible right now given the state of SBCL.",1214923082

Sure, it would be nice if there were never any errors, but there are, and you have to handle them somehow.

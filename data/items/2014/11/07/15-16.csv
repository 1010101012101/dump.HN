Since Emacs Lisp doesn&#x27;t have namespaces or modules, all functions must be uniquely named which is done by prefixing them: foo-replace. This is not that different from having a module foo, as Armstrong notes: &quot;managing a namespace with namees like foo.bar.baz.z is just as complex as managing a namespace with names like foo_bar_baz_z&quot;.<p>But what it enabled is an Emacs community where single functions are freely shared, for example on <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/</a>.

8572981,comment,8572600,8572600,0,0,moron4hire,,,"I think what you&#x27;re discussing is really just namespacing ala C++, Java, or .NET. Especially with Java and .NET, you don&#x27;t import a self-contained module directly from individual source files. The modules are technically all accessible at any time (or at least, the ones linked in to the build, which in the case of the Java and .NET standard libraries is quite a smorgasbord). You just reference the class/function you want in some way: either with using statements or with fully qualified names.<p>Because, really, if you start throwing everything into one store, you&#x27;re going to run into the naming conflict issue, and any attempt at addressing the naming conflict issue is going to either look like importing modules or look like namespaces. You either have to explicitly state what your program has access to, or you explicitly state what function you mean when you have access to everything. Realistically, if you give every function a unique name and <i>don&#x27;t</i> use namespaces, then there will start to be functions called system_event_fire() and  game_gun_fire() and disasters_house_fire() and you&#x27;re right back to having namespaces, just not in name or with a syntax that makes things nice when you know you&#x27;re dealing with specific things.<p>Though, it&#x27;d be nice if types weren&#x27;t the only thing that could be placed into a namespace directly in .NET. I&#x27;d like to put free functions in there. The Math class in the System namespace only exists because of this. I&#x27;d have prefered there to be a System.Math namespace and Cosine and Sine be members of it. Then I could &quot;using System.Math;&quot; and call &quot;Cos(angle)&quot;. Instead, I&#x27;m stuck in a limbo of half-qualified names.<p>And I like it. I like it a lot more than Python, Racket, Node.js, etc. and having to import this Thing X from that Module Y. I like the idea that linking modules together is defined at the build level, not at the individual source file level. These languages are supposed to be better for exploratory programming than Java and C#, but actually, you know, doing the exploring part is harder!<p>Sometimes, I really do just want to blap out the fully qualified name of a function, in place in my code. System.Web.HttpContext.Current.User. If I&#x27;m doing something like that, it&#x27;s a hack, and I know it&#x27;s a hack, and having the fully qualified name in there, uglying it up, makes clearer that it&#x27;s a hack. Though, I suppose I&#x27;m one of the rare people who actually do go back and clean up my hacks.<p>EDIT: I thought I wrote more, weird.<p>The network-accessible database of every library, ever, is definitely a great idea. I think it&#x27;s where we&#x27;re heading, with tools like NPM, NuGet, etc. It seems like a natural progression to move the package manager into the compiler (or linker, rather, but that&#x27;s in the compiler in most languages now). Add in support in an editor to have code completion lists include a search of the package repository and you&#x27;re there.",1415374861

But at the same time we were developing the language we were also looking at how you would use the language and its features to build such systems. The language and the system architecture went hand-in-hand with support in erlang for the type of patterns you would need in the system architecture.<p>These ideas and patterns existed before OTP. So there were Ericsson products built on top of Erlang which used these ideas and patterns before OTP. OTP &quot;just&quot; took these ideas and design patterns and formalised them in a generic, cohesive way.

8572952,comment,8566055,8567973,0,0,lsc,,,">That&#x27;s not to say that I&#x27;m never distracted or procrastinating. However, the cause of my procrastination is the same regardless of environment. Whether it is my old corporate cube environment (surrounded by by co-workers), my co-working space (surrounded by random people working), and my home office (surrounded by my cat) the root cause is that the work is uninteresting and uninspiring. A change of project is the best way to change that. A new feature rather than support another. A walk around the block and some fresh air a short term fix.<p>Yeah, for me?  that usually doesn&#x27;t work.  I mean, I switch tasks and goals often, but that doesn&#x27;t help me focus, usually, at least not long enough to accomplish something.   Work is one of those things that is less immediately satisfying than, say, hacker news, games, or a billion other distractions, but work is vastly more satisfying when I accomplish something.    For me?  it takes a lot of effort and tricks to get myself to focus long enough to finish something, but when I do?  it&#x27;s incredibly rewarding.   Maybe I need to break up my tasks into smaller chunks?  But a lot of my work is support-type work, where it&#x27;s already in smallish chunks.<p>But... yeah.  I suppose other people are better able to focus on that further-out reward than I am.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me?  Maybe it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m coming down off of a long period of being less than productive?<p>Either way, I think that personally, I&#x27;m way better off showing up.",1415374638

And if your opsec isn&#x27;t perfect, you&#x27;re busted right there:  Did you forget to set up a new email account for all of your craigslist transactions?  Did you forget to set them up and connect to them only through Tor?<p>Did the person you met with write down your license plate number?  Seem unlikely?  Think again.  Cameras write down your license plate number as you drive.  Constantly.  So the authorities will simply look up where the person drove to meet you (parking lot, etc) and any cars that drove to the area at the time.  You&#x27;ll probably be on a highway at some point, which is a highway of data collection.  There weren&#x27;t <i>that</i> many people who drove a long distance to go to the meetup area.  Now the authorities know which of 1,000 people you are.  The more times you do this, the fewer the number of suspects there are, until they&#x27;re down to a number that they can just investigate one by one.  Then you&#x27;re caught.<p>Or did you take your cell phone with you, and did the person who sold you components take their cell phone?  Yes, you&#x27;re caught.  The operation in the previous paragraph, which assumes that you&#x27;re just driving to meet someone and both parties are leaving their cell phones at home, is already busted.  So if you&#x27;ve taken your cell phone on top of it, then it&#x27;s even easier.  Anything involving correlating cell phone movements is trivial for authorities.  And if you don&#x27;t take your cell phone, how are you going to let them know you&#x27;ve arrived?  What if they&#x27;re late?  Or you&#x27;re late?  Now you have two problems: Set up a burner phone in an anonymous way (hello, in-store security cameras) and then never, ever use this cell phone in the same place as your main cell phone.  Not a good position to be in.<p>I&#x27;ve ignored the whole &quot;fake ID&quot; aspect, because if you&#x27;re in a position where someone is putting their face onto a forged legal document, that person is going to be persuaded by authorities to betray you.  And if that person is you, then obviously you&#x27;re caught at this point.  Your face is probably on Facebook, and facial recognition software is getting pretty good nowadays.<p>In general, physical ops are the most dangerous of all ops, and should be avoided until every other avenue has been explored.

A low level API where you create a context, then give it [clear|cipher]text and it gives you [cipher|clear]text, <i>and</i> and API that builds on top of it to provide socket communication? I don&#x27;t see why the two are mutually exclusive. Now, your complaint about event loop integration is very valid. You should be able to use select/epoll/kqueue/etc. on TLS sockets without having to worry about what your libssl is doing.<p>I wrote exactly one program that uses libssl in C directly. It is a special-purpose web server that can serve files or stream content over an HTTPS connection [1]. It was a huge pain to get my event loop to play nice with TLS because TLS does more reads/writes where a plain HTTP connection would do just reads or just writes. I also had to enable various non-defaults (SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE | SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS) to get it to behave more like a regular socket. Having a more standard way to support stuff like this would be great, and it does exist in other places. For example, Python wraps libssl in such a way that you can just wrap a plain socket into a TLS socket, and it pretty much just works. It&#x27;d be great if stuff like this existed at a lower level where this new API seems to live.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ipartola/hawkeye"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipartola/hawkeye</a>",1415374508

8572933,comment,8572600,8572600,0,0,derefr,,,"A function&#x27;s true name should be its content hash. (Where that content hash is calculated after canonicalizing all the call-sites in the function into content hash refs themselves.) This way:<p>- functions are versioned by name<p>- a function will &quot;pull in&quot; its dependencies, transitively, at compile time; a function will never change behaviour just because a dependency has a new version available<p>- the global database can store <i>all</i> functions ever created, without worrying about anyone stepping on anyone else&#x27;s toes<p>- magical zero-install (runtime reference of a function hash that doesn&#x27;t exist -> the process blocks while it gets downloaded from the database.) This is <i>safe</i>: presuming a currently-accepted cryptographic hash, if you ask for a function with hash X, you&#x27;ll be running known code.<p>- you can still build &quot;curation&quot; schemes on top of this, with author versioning, using basically Freenet&#x27;s Signed Subspace Key approach (sort of equivalent to a checkout of a git repo). The module author publishes a signed function which returns a function when passed an identifier (this is your &quot;module&quot;). Later, they publish a new function that maps identifiers to other functions. The whole stdlib could live in the DB and be dereferenced into cache on first run from a burned-in module-function ref.<p>- function unloading can be done automatically when nothing has called into (or is running in the context of) a function for a while. Basically, garbage collection.<p>- you can still do late binding if you want. In Erlang, &quot;remote&quot; (fully-qualified) calls don&#x27;t usually mean to switch semantics on version change; they just get conflated with fully-qualified self-calls, which are explicitly for that. In a flat function namespace, you&#x27;d probably have to make late-binding explicit for the compiler, since it would never be assumed otherwise. E.g. you&#x27;d call apply() with a function identifier, which would kick in the function metadata resolution mechanism (now normally just part of the <i>linker</i>) at runtime.<p>Plug: I am already working on a BEAM-compatible VM with exactly these semantics. (Also: 1. a container-like concept of security domains, allowing for multiple &quot;virtual nodes&quot; to share the same VM schedulers while keeping isolated heaps, atom tables, etc. [E.g. you set up a container for a given user&#x27;s web requests to run under; if they crash the VM, no problem, it was just their virtual VM.] 2. Some logic with code signing such that calling a function written by X, where you haven&#x27;t explicitly trusted X, sets up a domain for X and runs it in there. 3. Some PNaCl-like tricks where object files are simply code-signed binary ASTs, and final compilation happens at load-time. But the cached compiled artifact can sit in the global database and can be checked by the compiler, and reused, as an optimization of actually doing compilation. Etc.)

My code reads like:<p><pre><code>    useful_fun(&quot;do it&quot;, &quot;to it&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nbut I have some kind of dependencies/import record which says that &quot;useful_fun&quot; is actually 8804ea505fda087da53b799434c377f015933707. That means one and only one thing across all time, the func with that hash.<p>So how do we handle updates? If we want a golang-like model, the developer could run something like &quot;update deps&quot;. This would:<p>- go back to the central repository, looking for updates to 8804ea505fda087da53b799434c377f015933707. It might find 5. Local policy then determines what happens. Could be &quot;always choose the original authors update&quot; or &quot;choose the one with the most votes&quot; or &quot;always ask the dev, showing diffs&quot;.<p>Note that because the unique name is based on the function content, any change to it creates a new item in the db. (Content-addressability, same way git and other systems do it.)<p>- stuff can be grouped and batched. If I pull in 10 functions tagged with the same project (&#x27;module&#x27;) and they&#x27;ve all been updated, I can say &quot;and do the same with all the others&quot;.<p>- This kind of metadata allows all kind of good stuff. I can subscribe to alerts on the functions I&#x27;ve imported and get told about new versions, or security warnings. This kind of subscription information can be used as a popularity contest to solve the &quot;which fork on github do I want to use&quot; problem?<p>- people can still publish modules. They now look like a git directory or tree. A git tree is a blob which contains the hashes of the files within it. A &#x27;module&#x27; could be a blob which specifies which (immutable) functions are in it.<p>If we use normalised functions, we&#x27;ve now got a module representation which allows arbitrary functions to be pulled together. At fetch time, we can denormalise into the user&#x27;s preferred coding style. At push time, we renormalise. We aren&#x27;t grouping stuff into files, so a &#x27;project&#x27; or a &#x27;module&#x27; consists solely of the semantic contents, nothing to do with artificial grouping for the file system.<p>Seems like an interesting future.",1415374044

Now let&#x27;s look at latency. Cowboy took about 4 times the time, .8 ms on average per request to the CPPSP&#x27;s .2. Great, C++ all the way, right? Err...no. Look at the max and standard deviations.<p>Cowboy had a max latency of 3.7 ms. CPPSP had a max of 134.6. Standard deviation of cowboy was .3 ms. Standard deviation of CPPSP was .5 ms.<p>So Cowboy is still really quite fast, more predictable, and has far smaller outliers. What are people going to be more likely to object to, waiting 3.7 ms, or 134 ms?<p>Couple that with the reliability Erlang provides, the ability to scale straight outta the box (so if you find you&#x27;re hitting a throughput issue you have a clear path forward), and the joy of functional coding...and it&#x27;s pretty compelling, to me at least.",1415372586

The way I present it, is to teach good development habits by using good development tools.<p>1. Before <i>anything</i> start with version control and how to use it effectively. With out this step you got nothing.<p>2. Collaboration. Choose a project management tool (Jira or the like) and show them how to use it effectively. Show them how developers use it to keep PHB & managers honest.<p>3. Continuous Integration. Choose a CI of your choice, set it up, get it working for them, get them addicted to the time/work savings. (I use Jenkins, but now there are better ones)<p>4. Testing. Teach them <i>why</i> testing is good, help them implementing the testing framework (On the CI) and help institute it as a 1st level part of the development process.<p>My style, is to never give them &quot;more work&quot;, but to show them how each step <i>saves</i> them work and time.<p>Regards",1415372481

It&#x27;s just that the speed of technology change has been faster than social awareness.<p>For instance, most people understand cameras - they&#x27;ve been around since birth.  And, most would be uncomfortable if there was a visible camera on every surface, pointed at them.  There&#x27;s an understanding that there&#x27;s a &#x27;watcher&#x27; at the other end of that picture or video.  In fact, as cameras emerged, some cultures rejected them as a technology that could &#x27;steal the soul&#x27;.<p>But, today, most people don&#x27;t understand the &#x27;sensors&#x27; that are everywhere, tracking their behavior.  Not only are the sensors invisible, they&#x27;re not something that most people are even aware of or understand.

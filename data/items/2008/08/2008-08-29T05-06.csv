289857,comment,289412,289501,0,0,stcredzero,,,"What if everything is through encrypted connections?  It will be hard for the carriers to identify what's a particular service.  Also, if there is robust market demand for services, the proliferation of servers will be too much for the carriers to stay on top of.  There will be a market for multi-service proxies, so the carriers won't be able to target a particular service and cut it off by simply cutting off particular servers.  They will need to employ strong-arm tactics, which will make them vulnerable to legislation.",1219989469

That is, if Steve has put away his grudge and allows it to happen.<p>A lightweight tablet computer as a consumer ""digital hub"" with support from wireless technology and Bonjour actually makes a lot of sense, especially if you can pair it with something like a Mac Mini or Apple TV form factor for the bulk of the storage, and as an interface with the living room HDTV.<p>Better yet, sell small, inexpensive wireless devices that can receive a stream for stereos and video screens around the house, as in Airport Express?  Perhaps sell a program that can be used with the Wii?",1219986895

You can usually start off picking 10+ point favorites (which, if memory serves me, win about 85% of the time) but as you use up the better teams that worsens. For instance week 1 if you pick New England, you're a 16.5 pt favorite and will win almost always.<p>But yeah, the tiebreakers will handle it if it happens.",1219986786

You can argue that those aren&#x27;t valuable, but I don&#x27;t think you can argue that type-checked generic monads are critical for achieving them.<p>In practice, 75% of the time that I use monads I am using some kind of monad stack. I&#x27;m sure you can argue that this is unnecessary or that I only do so because Haskell affords it... but on the other hand, I believe that transformer stacks do a good job of elaborating the space of effect types with an efficient, expressive language. Without them you either elide side effect reification or build a lot of one-off monad stacks.",1412402038
8408900,comment,8407395,8407646,2,0,jewel,,,"This is called intrusion detection, and there are a number of ready-made products that do it more efficiently.  For an example, see tripwire.  This will easily handle /Applications/.<p>On first run it gets a hash of all the files, and then you schedule subsequent runs in cron to see what has changed.<p>The problem with any approach like this is that if it were in common use that it&#x27;d be easy for the malware to change tripwire itself to stop it from detection.  It also won&#x27;t detect something that only infects running processes, infects firmware, or otherwise leaves the local filesystem alone.  That&#x27;s why you&#x27;d want to have defense in depth, such as having a separate box monitoring traffic, looking for anomalies.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the appropriate approach would be on a end-user machine.  Any security measure that&#x27;s implemented in software on the machine itself is a arms race against the malware authors.  This has been going on for a long time in the Windows world, and I don&#x27;t think there is anything fundamentally different about Linux and OS X that would protect them if they received the same amount of attention from malware authors.",1412402013

8408898,comment,8407083,8408877,1,0,ObviousScience,,,"Again, of course there are cases for which knowing CPR or other training makes a difference - an obvious one is having basic first aid training around pools, particularly in the case of diving accidents leading to spinal injuries. Knowing the proper procedure to stabilize the person until paramedics can arrive on the scene does a lot to lessen the chance of secondary damage (eg, from the being moved wrong while trying to keep them from drowning).<p>I don&#x27;t think that anyone is arguing that having more people know CPR or first aid is bad, but rather, the number of cases cited were too small to even infer that kind of information from: it&#x27;s quite possible that there&#x27;s nothing that could have been done for many of the cases the paramedics were late to respond without actual medical equipment onsite, ie, having more than just bystanders who know CPR or basic first aid. The gap in size between the cited number of cases and the number of cases that happen is too great, especially considering that the cited number of cases were from a biased selection, eg, only cases that matched a particular profile.<p>It&#x27;s important that we not let emotion or our desire to do something about tragedies cloud our vision of what&#x27;s actually helpful and what things actually matter.<p>I would expect for every case cited to me where someone saved a life being a bystander, I could find one where bystanders with basic training and good intentions ended up making the situation worse. That is, of course, beside the point, because both collections of anecdotes would be just that, and not actual data about what&#x27;s a good idea.",1412401985

8408884,comment,8408452,8408841,4,0,fortknots,,,"This is exactly where I&#x27;m at. My biggest problem is that wrapping non-persistent data structures written in C/C++ never seems comes out right in Haskell. You often have to write them in the IO monad, which is the absolute last thing you want for an otherwise general purpose data structure. I think there may be some solution here using linear types, which enforce that a data type is referenced only once at compile time. This would let you avoid being forced to guarantee persistence when all you care about is speed.<p>This argument may seem more abstract than what you mention, but in fact it gets to the very heart of why there aren&#x27;t good unboxed mutable arrays in haskell. In truth, there are. You can convert Immutable Vectors (which are lists with O(1) indexing but no mutation) into Mutable Vectors in constant time using unsafeThaw. The problem is that your code is no longer persistent, and you&#x27;ve risked introducing subtle errors. My biggest problem is that the haskell community seems to look at non-persistent data structures as sacrilegious. As a scientific programmer, that makes me feel like maybe learning haskell wasn&#x27;t such a good investment after all. But on the bright side, functional programming is on the rise, and I&#x27;m confident that all my experience with Haskell will transfer well in the future.",1412401439

If it&#x27;s &quot;won&#x27;t segfault&quot; or &quot;allow access to a user&#x27;s private data&quot; then dynamic solutions can be as safe as static solutions. If you define safety as a lack of faults at run-time, then by definition static solutions are safer.<p>If you want to define safety broadly, then both static (upfront analysis, type checking) and run time solutions (hyper visors, tag checks, monitoring) are necessary to achieve it.",1412401426

That means 99% of the population can devote themselves to less urgent priorities, like building shelters, making clothes, etc. Sure, those crackerjack fish catchers who could catch 2 or 3 fish a day have lost their jobs, and might become less affluent than they were...but the few losers in every industry when technology changes the employment structure are outweighed by the vast majority who benefit greatly.

But, crucially, the compile-time check guarantees that these tags will always be valid. Assuming you have handled every possible variant of a type (e.g. `Just ...` and `Nothing` for the `Maybe` type), you are guaranteed that you are &quot;covered&quot;. Unlike in, say, python, where you might get passed a string, or None, or...?<p>> The idea that compile-time checks is much better than runtime checks is also not obvious<p>Dynamic languages have their place, but there&#x27;s no contest whatsoever when it comes to safety. What&#x27;s better: discovering an error before the code has run, or discovering the same error while the code is running, possibly in production? In the huge majority of cases, the former is preferable.<p>> What is better - to clutter the code with explicit type annotation or clutter the code with explicit type-tag checking in the runtime code is another question.<p>With type inference, you get the best of both worlds :) Most Haskell code doesn&#x27;t need any type annotations, and most of what&#x27;s out there only has explicit type annotations for top-level expressions, for purposes of documentation.",1412400170

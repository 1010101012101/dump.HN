7892,comment,7854,7854,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Interestingly, Larry Page was reluctant to publish this infamous research paper when it was first conceived. Much of Larry's thinking was inspired by Nikola Tesla's life; a genius whose inventions were often mocked upon and stolen by Thomas Edison. It was Larry's research advisor who convinced him to publish the paper.<p>Other interesting sites:-<p>Google Search Engine in 1997: <a href=""http://backrub.tjtech.org/1997/index.htm"">http://backrub.tjtech.org/1997/index.htm</a><p>Explanation of PageRank: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank</a><p>\nBackRub research (which ultimiately led to PageRank): <a href=""http://backrub.tjtech.org/1997/backrub.htm"">http://backrub.tjtech.org/1997/backrub.htm</a><p>\nlol@""Sorry, many services are unavailable due to a local network faliure beyond our control.

7891,comment,7872,7873,0,0,inklesspen,,,"I guess this depends on what you mean by ""most advanced"". TeXmacs combines the easy learning curve of Emacs with the familiar word processing paradigm of TeX to form a program usable by 1/10000 of the market. Sure, it's advanced. So's the flight deck of the Airbus A380.<p>A more successful interpretation of ""most advanced"" would be ""gives the user the easiest interface to use to accomplish his tasks"". By that standard, I think Google Docs or Writeboard is much more advanced than TeXmacs.",1175374028
7889,comment,7859,7883,0,0,Tichy,,,"OK, not the right place for that discussion. The reason languages like python are inherently slower is that they are not strongly typed. It seems only LISP is getting it right, I think there you can voluntarily use strong typing, allowing for dramatic speed improvements - why don't any other languages copy that? (I think it must be the typing that is responsible for the speed difference - this time I don't have an official article backing that up). ",1175373977

7885,comment,7854,7854,0,0,amichail,,,"It's interesting that most web 2.0 services do not appear deep in any theoretical sense. In particular, 99% probably do not have  anything that comes even close to the sophistication behind the PageRank algorithm.<p>But still, some web 2.0 services have become very popular.<p>It seems that if you do not have any sophisticated algorithms behind your approach, you can still succeed if you are the first to address a need (even if you do it in the most naive way imaginable) and you get sufficient publicity. <p>The vast majority of people could care less about sophisticated algorithms.  The vast majority of people do not obsess over whether an approach is prone to spam.\n",1175373315

I'm pretty new to Lisp so I'm still learning what I'm looking at, however it looks like something in the stream from the server (possibly while reading headers?) is messing up CHUNGA:READLINE<i> which Drakma uses.",1175373097
7883,comment,7859,7875,0,0,inklesspen,,,"My perception is that the extra coding done to implement things like patterns to get around the fact that Java is so limited a language will cut down on the performance gains. But I don't have any statistics to back that up.<p>BTW, Python is not just a scripting language. It is a real language that just happens to be usable as a scripting language. Lua is a scripting language.",1175373028
7882,comment,7829,7833,0,0,dfranke,,,"But how many of them would take Techstars?  Giving away 5% of my equity for $10000 is a pretty marginal decision without the advice and connections that come with it, and I've yet to see that TechStars has any advice that isn't plaigarized from your essays.  Being forced to be based in Boulder pretty much puts me under the bottom.",1175372635

7880,comment,7543,7567,0,0,jward,,,"You're making the assumption the majority of people want insightful and informative.  The fact that there is a huge market for content like Survivor and Fear Factor makes me doubt this assumption.<p>I'd say that Reddit has more to worry about from niche copycats than another large site.  Why go to Reddit for your celeb gossip and pictures of cats with dumb text when there's a site dedicated to it?

7878,comment,7861,7861,0,0,dfranke,,,"""Also, the current trend in blogging, led by Valleywag and others, is to 'go negative first, and ask questions later.'   That tabloid-style journalism tends to generate a lot of eyeballs and, subsequently, advertiser dollars. This is something we just can't compete with. By acquiring FC, we can go more negative faster than anyone else out there, when and if we need to.""<p>That pretty much gives it away.  April Fools.",1175371452

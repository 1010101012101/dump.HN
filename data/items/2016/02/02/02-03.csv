The team decided to try out Ruby on Rails for the first time (this was 2007 iirc) and it was such a delight I haven&#x27;t stopped being primarily a ruby/rails developer since.<p>Second, at the last place I worked I was the primary developer on a team of 2 that wrote an iphone app that was on the end of the year top apps on the itunes store as an honorable mention.

What I&#x27;m saying is that there are a lot of slapped together tools out there trying to provide a declarative/atomic infrastructure that are doing it poorly...but, are quite popular. NixOS seems like an ideal tool for the task; as you note, one could readily build your containers with NixOS (and I think it&#x27;d be the ideal choice for that).

Likewise, there&#x27;s a lot of throwing security out the window; a tremendous level of trust is being given to container builders.<p>I could rant all day about stuff like this, and there&#x27;s always the risk of turning into Grandpa Simpson. So, I&#x27;ll stop ranting after a summary:<p>Containers are cool, but a lot of people are making a lot of mistakes in their use of containers. NixOS is cool, and might remedy some of the problems I see in the way people are using containers (while also solving a number of other problems of reliable deployments, not just with containers).",1454381614

I&#x27;m also giving them the benefit of the doubt in assuming that they weren&#x27;t necessarily wrong.  Because the alternative is to believe either that 1) they are all idiots for thinking it was possible or 2) that they hired Marissa knowing full well that she was going to fail no matter what she did, and she accepted the offer and pocketed the $36M for her first six months on the job knowing full well that she was going to fail no matter what she did.

I (90+%) love what I do and we&#x27;re fortunate that it pays enough for us to live on just &quot;my&quot; compensation. In theory, her job could have become part-time; in practice, that would have worked very, very poorly at her company. My job couldn&#x27;t be done part-time or job-shared in any practical way.<p>So, I happen to be the stereotypical working dad, but it&#x27;s not because of gender biases or pre-conceived notions, but rather because of math/finance/satisfaction concerns. We could live OK in Cambridge on just &quot;my&quot; comp but couldn&#x27;t on just &quot;hers&quot;; I actively like my job and she didn&#x27;t. We do 100% pool the money and there is no sense of &quot;yours, mine, and ours&quot;, only &quot;ours&quot;. I actively take pains to ensure that, but the tax brackets[1] and cost of daycare in Cambridge being what they are, the math made it a near even-money proposition.<p>So, in our case it was a combination of my wife&#x27;s pay being lower and also the [dis-]satisfaction with spending ~1/4 of her life (and ~1/2 of her awake life) that way made it a near no-brainer.<p>1 - In essence, when considering forgoing her income, her income is effectively entirely taxed at our highest federal bracket, plus she&#x27;s still paying Medicare, FICA, and state income tax on top of that.

I don&#x27;t understand this argument at all.<p>First, there are two problems you want to solve with respect to train &quot;position&quot;.  One is distance along the track, and the other is which track it&#x27;s on.  The track centers are often 15 or 20 feet apart; GPS may not be good enough to determine which track it&#x27;s on.  There are other systems that determine that.  But now you want to integrate those other systems with the GPS, and now the problem is much less simple than &quot;there&#x27;s this thing called GPS&quot;.<p>> Why are humans even in this particular loop? It&#x27;s a train, not a car or an aircraft!<p>If you don&#x27;t have absolute control of your right-of-way, you&#x27;d better have actual eyeballs up front.  A car can stall on a crossing.  Some drunk can be walking down the track.  Some drunk can even be <i>driving</i> down the track.  Somebody can even be trying to move a house across the tracks (I&#x27;ve seen a photo of the aftermath of that one).<p>And if you&#x27;re going to say, &quot;if the photos of the aftermath, the train didn&#x27;t stop in time, so what&#x27;s the point of the engineer?&quot;, well, the engineer can try to minimize the damage by seeing that some idiot is trying to move a house across the tracks, and coming as close as possible to stopping where he shouldn&#x27;t have to stop at all.<p>> It&#x27;s not going anywhere it didn&#x27;t go before, and it has no business going 1 MPH faster or slower past any given point on the track than it did the last time!<p>Slower trains ahead of it.  Temperature too hot, so sun kinks are possible.  Temperature too low, so pull-aparts are possible.  Too much rain, so a river may have washed out a bridge.  Some kind of event right next to the tracks, so go slow and watch for people where they shouldn&#x27;t be.  Maintenance work on the track next door, so go slow and use the horn a lot, because sometimes those workers forget to pay attention to what&#x27;s happening on the next track.  Those are just off the top of my head.<p>Then there&#x27;s BART, which did exactly what you said - they automated it.  One day a train misread an instruction from a sensor, and tried to go 68 MPH when it should have been stopping for a station.  The station happened to be the end of the (elevated) line.

I am a 2013 graduate from community college (AS in Computer Science and Computer Networking). I have been programming since the age of 15 - since my friends on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) got me interested in IRC server design, botnets and abusing raw sockets for fun and profit (I wrote a small service to lie to traceroute and spoof additional endpoints). I have worked as a lead documentation editor and a system administrator (and enjoyed it!) for 8 years at a small scale (8-14 servers). I take pride in my ability to learn independently but I have also disciplined myself to get a formal education (associate degree in CS & Computer Networking). I plan to continue my education toward a Masters in Computer Science but I need to focus on closer employment right now. I am passionate about backend design and network programming. I love learning and consuming protocols but I am also trying to grow into the mold of a frontend developer as I see traditional desktop applications being ported to the web as &#x27;the future&#x27;.<p>I am looking for somewhere to get my feet wet among a team of friendly like-minded individuals. Business networking is important to me and I would like to gain more opportunities in this area. I would be happy to even move into a position where I&#x27;m simply maintaining a project. I have been through several tutorials for Angular, Backbone, Ember, Meteor, and React. I feel capable but not wise about how to make use of them. My preference is React as it is very easy to integrate into a project alongside an existing framework like Ember. I consider myself not an expert but someone who has a good depth of knowledge covering a broad area - this aids me when figuring out a tough problem as I am willing to look outside my comfort zone to find a solution.<p>Very willing to interview, even if I might not be an exact fit - I await your correspondence! :-)<p>(PS: I can be reached on Freenode as &#x27;Sleepy_Coder&#x27; - but email is preferred for an introduction)",1454378649

6702180,comment,6701583,6702103,1,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Java only allows &#x27;final&#x27; or immutable variables to be passed into closures. This prevents the value from changing and ensures that the compiler catches the problem if you try to pass a changing value into a closure.<p>&quot;Final&quot; in Java does not make objects immutable. The object itself can have mutator methods that change instance variables/attributes of the object, even though the identifier is declared as final.<p>IIRC, the only reason Java requires variables in closures to be final is for garbage collection. &quot;final&quot; allows the runtime to know that the identifier itself isn&#x27;t going to be rebound to a <i>different object</i>, which is different from knowing that the object that it is being bound to won&#x27;t change internally.<p>(Disclaimer: It&#x27;s been a while since I used Java proper, so I&#x27;m probably missing some subtlety with the explanation of the rationale, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s something along these lines).",1384016156

That is, using the Iraq War as an example:<p>- I support the Iraq War, if it is done this way (describe reservations)<p>- The Iraq War is not done that way in the slightest<p>- Given the above, I support the Iraq War<p>The NYT supports TPP with qualifications; the TPP will not have those attributes; given the above, the NYT will absolutely support the TPP.  It&#x27;s a way to deflect criticism - if anyone criticizes your support, you just point to your expressed reservations.<p>Second, free trade has proven to be not good for the bulk of the public.  Most HN commenters, having been immersed in right-wing economics, have the belief that it is somehow scientifically proven that free trade is beneficial for all, but that&#x27;s not actually what the science says.  The results of decades of &quot;free trade&quot; agreements have been to overrule local decision-making; they are profoundly anti-democratic.  They&#x27;ve resulted in a massive transfer of wealth from the bulk of the population to a very few, very wealthy individuals.  Free trade agreements are a substantial cause for the fact that most workers in the United States are making less money now than they were 30 years ago, even though their productivity has gone up massively in the meantime.<p>If an action X takes away $1 from each of nine people, and gives $15 to the tenth person, the total benefit for society in dollars is theoretically positive (-$9, +$15) but nine out of ten people have been harmed by it, and it&#x27;s not clear that the real benefit is positive at all, because of the declining marginal utility of money.  That&#x27;s pretty much what &quot;free trade&quot; represents.

Most people will think of successive languages in terms of their first, until they learn many and are able to think more generally.<p>Lisp has the advantage that it really teaches the general semantics of programming languages, because it&#x27;s syntax is just the syntax tree, and it basically only has one form, which is function application. There&#x27;s some &quot;special forms&quot; built into the implementation of a lisp to make it useful, but those shouldn&#x27;t be confused with syntax. In fact, the parenthesis and space between function and arguments shouldn&#x27;t be considered <i>the</i> lisp syntax either - it&#x27;s just one way to represent a tree structure in linear text.<p>I think the real issue is the confusion in teaching is between Computer Science and Computing as a vocation. Nobody teaches the former any more, because it&#x27;s less useful <i>in the real world</i>.

You don&#x27;t need the reserves at all (if you&#x27;re a bank; if you&#x27;re not a bank, then you have never in your life held reserves, and the way you may or may not be able to make loans is qualitatively different).<p>When a bank makes a loan, they simply create a new deposit, say worth 100#. If the reserve ratio is 0.1, and assuming that bank had exactly the required reserves before this operation, then they will have to acquire 10# in additional reserves within a week or two (yes, you read that correctly; reserve requirements are after-the-fact requirement that can be fulfilled with some delay).<p>More likely, though, the person or company that the loan was made to will use these 100# to pay somebody else, and in doing so, the newly created deposit is transfered to another bank B.<p>To balance this transfer, bank A must transfer 100# in reserves to bank B. Usually, it will simply borrow those reserves from bank B against an appropriate collateral such as the loan it has made. The profit of bank A from the loan is the different in interest between the interest owed by their customer, and the interest they have to pay in the interbank market to bank B.<p>At the same time, bank B now has an increased reserve requirement, and they need to get those 10# from somewhere.<p>As I explained previously, this will lead to the interbank rate being bid up if there are no excess reserves in the system. When that happens, the central bank buys assets from banks in exchange for new reserves (instead of outright buying, a repurchase agreement may be made).<p>However, banks <i>also</i> have the option to directly borrow reserves from the central bank, at a fixed interest rate.",1384014481

C++ allows functional, procedural and OO and many more programming styles. It supports manual and automatic memory management. It can be used to teach high level and low level programming constructs. But I think we&#x27;re all in agreement that C++ is not a good first language to learn despite (or because of) its versatility.<p>I think Python is a very accessible programming language that still has enough depth to go into a lot of interesting CS subjects.

From what I understand, anyone who signs up to work with Ford Motor also signs a legal agreement saying you take on legal responsibility for your actions....<p>As an example, Ford is also a big Linux shop but they do not use any old Linux distro.  They have partnered with Novell (SUSE Linux) who indemnifies them from all open source code found in the SUSE distribution.<p>When I was on Ford SYNC, no Google code ran on the module.  The feature they are talking about is called Send To Sync and it&#x27;s a web service where the SYNC module can receive a map planned on Google Maps.

You have a fortune-5 company here.  Translation for you:  They are a very large target for lawsuits.  The open source software provides no indemnification.<p>You also have to remember when SYNC was in the planning stages long before the public knew about it.  I was part of the original team responsible for taking the whole concept to reality.<p>I can tell you that internally, it was one of the most well run software architecture teams I was ever apart of.  The middle level managers really know how to run software teams which is not something you might expect from a big old automotive company.<p>But in many ways, our hands were tied.  Recall about the time Bill Gates and Bill Ford riding around in a model-T.  A lot of us didn&#x27;t want Windows for automotive and were trying to champion Linux.  Also, the iMX3 which was in the first generation SYNC modules was at the time a slow processor.<p>And to top things off, a fair bit of the software running on the SYNC module is not written by Ford.  Ford partnered up with a crappy company called B-Squared.<p>The Maps are not Ford&#x27;s either.  When I was on the team, Ford had partnered with INRIX for Maps, traffic and direction.<p>SYNC is just not a simple single board computer with some apps running on it.  There is an entire eco-system build around the SYNC module because it&#x27;s connected to the vehicle networks (CAN Bus).  Microsoft & Ford being partners (Windows servers in data center), Microsoft wanted to handle some of the software development but when Ford asked Microsoft to sign off on some legal agreement asking MS to take any and all responsibility for things like inadvertently deploying an air bag, they backed off.<p>Also, Ford SYNC as I said has an eco system of roughly 20-30 backend applications that support it.  Some of these have to do with 911 assist and the TREAD act.  The TREAD act is the US Federal Government&#x27;s oversight on safety claims.<p>Because via SYNC you can report problems and have your vehicle serviced, their is a lot internal logic that keeps track of what is called EOL (End of Line) data about a vehicle which needs to funnel into TREAD act reporting.<p>Think about the not so long ago Toyota problem where they tried to blame floor mats for gas peddles getting stuck.<p>EDIT:\nAlso, the GUI is not Microsoft CE native.  The WindowsCE is just the OS running on the SYNC module.  The GUI was Adobe ActionScript.  Trust me, many of us yelled very loud about how stupid an idea this was but because B-Squared own the implementation (not the architecture), they were aloud to chose whatever they wanted to meet Ford specs.  The results are a history less: JD Powers gave it SYNC poor ratings and many of us (myself included) got the hell out of dodge.<p>Middle managers, managing the day to day software architecture and specifications, were caught between a rock and a hard place with senior management (Allan Mullaly, Mark Fields, Bill Ford, Marcy Klevorn) pushing these partnership relationships we were forced to work within.",1418320051

Sure, one might buy 1 CD. Even 10 CDs. But very few people would buy those 20GB+ of worth of music they hoard on their harddrives. It&#x27;s something they take for free but would never pay for.<p>The difference with music is that you can make a partial purchase because the product is sliced into small enough pieces. I may have the whole discography of a band spanning decades, but I only buy one or two of their albums. At least they still get some money that way, so maybe they don&#x27;t have to feel the same frustration that you do.<p>In that sense piracy enables some sort of involuntary &quot;set your own price&quot; scheme. But that only works if the product can be sliced down into small enough units enabling the consumers to set their own price.<p>For software this is more difficult, but not impossible. For example adobe products or microsoft office get pirated in private environments but paid for in commercial settings. The private copies serve to entrench the product in the market, even if they don&#x27;t generate a direct profit by themselves.

Also the less you cheat (perfect knowledge of the other players, perfect aim, etc) the better your bot. Having a non-cheating bot beat a human is a major achievement.<p>The bots for a strategy game like StarCraft is fundamentally  different than the bot for an FPS. They use completely different techniques and it&#x27;s much harder to cheat in strategy game (though ignoring the fog of war is the most egregious). Strategy game AI is more akin to chess AI - lots of search (minimax and stuff). It&#x27;s a whole field onto itself and you can only learn by studying the AI for that type of particular game.<p>FPS bots (like counter strike) are much closer to traditional game AI (shooters and such). Books on &quot;Game AI&quot; are a good place to start. Basically the two major problems is where should I go (evaluating cover, analyzing line of sight, estimating where enemies are and trying to pick a good place to stand) and how to I get there (pathfinding and pathfollowing). What you do when you get there is generally pretty straightforward (shooting at the appropriate guy). If you have a cover system you need to be able to tell them how to use cover and this involves a lot of animation (syncing my animations and position up to the cover in the world). But in an FPS this is usually just a question of crouching or not.<p>The big difference for FPS bots (versus single player enemy AI) is that bots need to choose between conflicting goals (should I go get ammo, should I go get health, should I attack the enemy). If you have a strict hierarchy of behaviours your bots won&#x27;t be competitive (enter fuzzy logic systems, utility theory and the like - normal behaviour trees won&#x27;t cut it).<p>Have fun!",1418319726

What if users switched to non-Apple, non-Android phones? In that case it would make the in-car system useless for the user.

I don&#x27;t think your first example is relevant.<p>Copyright exists to serve the public. I think it largely achieves that goal. There are fair arguments to be made as to when copyright/patents stop serving the public interests. I don&#x27;t think DRM as an enforcement of the copyright laws nullifies the protection already given. When it comes to copyright the following quote is long but largely sums of my thoughts.<p>&quot;A distinguishing characteristic of intellectual property is its &quot;public good&quot; aspect. While the cost of creating a work subject to copyright protection—for example, a book, movie, song, ballet, lithograph, map, business directory, or computer software program—is often high, the cost of reproducing the work, whether by the creator or by those to whom he has made it available, is often low. And once copies are available to others, it is often inexpensive for these users to make additional copies. If the copies made by the creator of the work are priced at or close to marginal cost, others may be discouraged from making copies, but the creator’s total revenues may not be sufficient to cover the cost of creating the work. Copyright protection—the right of the copyright’s owner to prevent others from making copies—trades off the costs of limiting access to a work against the benefits of providing incentives to create the work in the first place. Striking the correct balance between access and incentives is the central problem in copyright law. For copyright law to promote economic efficiency, its principal legal doctrines must, at least approximately, maximize the benefits from creating additional works minus both the losses from limiting access and the costs of administering copyright protection.&quot; from An Economic Analysis of Copyright Law, <a href=""http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/IPCoop/89land1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/IPCoop/89land1.html</a>",1418318972

They may have the technical ability to do so, but that does not make it moral or ethical to do so in the most general case.  I&#x27;d like to have a lower electrical bill.  Electricity is a non-tangible good, like bits.  Does that mean that I should be able to tell the electric company to shove off just because I think they charge too much for electricity?  Why is that any different?<p>If my software fails because nobody wants it at the price it&#x27;s at then that&#x27;s a signal that I should lower prices.  If my software fails because a large group decides to void the social contract and get my software for free because they disagree with their pricing then I have every right to get angry about it.  The software I produce took time and money to produce.  It&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t want to pay for it.  Then don&#x27;t use it.  You don&#x27;t get to have all of the benefit for none of the cost.  That&#x27;s the part that&#x27;s the most infuriating.<p>>Software piracy is a solved problem.<p>How do you make that logical jump?<p>>You have eyeballs/ears which you can easily turn into wallets.<p>Not if people are used to and can continue to get the software for free.  That relies upon the generosity of some other person down the line to actually pay for the software.  Some companies may choose to make that decision.  Good for them!  But the assumption that all companies will or must or otherwise be ethically or morally bankrupt is a bad one.  I&#x27;d love to spend all of my time building software for others and let them pay what they want for it, but I have to eat and have a family to support.<p>Software piracy doesn&#x27;t hurt big shops or new developers as much as it hurts the smaller guys.  Big shops price it into their software costs, and as you said, industry standard software (Office, Photoshop) rely upon it to bring in new users because their target market is saturated.  New developers are just happy to get their name out there in many cases - it&#x27;s a cost of doing business that they can afford.<p>The small shops in the middle get it the worst.  Not enough name recognition to be an industry leader yet enough people that feel entitled to their software for free.  The vast majority of them can&#x27;t win and fold.  Is that what meritocracy is?  Subject to the whims of an entitled core of freeloaders?",1418318790

Some people are still unaware that the four ghosts from Pac-Man each have a different decision-making algorithm.  The red ghost always targets the player.  The pink ghost targets four spaces away from the player in the direction it faces.  The cyan ghost uses a combination of player position, player facing, and the position of the red ghost to determine its target tile.  The orange ghost targets the player when far away, and a home corner position when the player is close.<p>Those four strategies in combination, along with some global behaviors for pathfinding and behavior modes, are often enough to defeat an unaware player.  (search: &quot;Pac-Man dossier&quot;)<p>This introduces the concept of <i>strategic archetypes</i>.  Human players have them, too.  I, for instance, often favor stealthy sniper strategies.  The various strategic archetypes often have a complex relationship web from who tends to defeat whom.  The player that always tries to do an early rush to overwhelm slower opponents before they can mount a defense may be easily defeated by a trap-and-decoy opponent, whereas that player may lose to a gather-intel-then-send-ninjas player.<p>To create a competitive AI, first identify how humans play the game, identify the strategic archetypes, then model your bot to pursue archetypal goals.  Then, most importantly, determine when to switch archetypes.  An early rusher AI has no strategy for midgame or endgame, so perhaps that AI evolves into aggressive expansion, or an ambusher.<p>But also remember that the point of the game is for the humans to have fun.  Avoid cheating, or overusing a game-breaking strategy.  Your bot won&#x27;t care if it loses, but a human may ragequit if he loses to a bot with a perceived unfair advantage.<p>Of course, there are some games with no human players.  There&#x27;s the &quot;rock paper scissors programming competition&quot; (rpscontest.com), where players submit algorithms, who then fight each other to the death for rank points.  It is interesting to see new strategies rise and fall, including those who win by &quot;cheating&quot;, such as by manipulating the match-generating program itself, setting the opponent&#x27;s random seed, examining the opponent&#x27;s heap or stack, or causing the opponent to be improperly disqualified for cheating.",1418318484

8735886,comment,8681040,8681040,0,0,OscarPedroso,,,"Z80 Labs - Buffalo, NY<p>Hi all,<p>I&#x27;m Oscar and I&#x27;m the founder of GradFly, &quot;Elance for open hardware projects&quot;.  This started a year ago out of Startup Weekend where we were finalists.  Since then, we&#x27;ve pitched live at TC Disrupt NY, Startup Fest, and recently finished a Series A fundraise (pitched to 30+ investors).<p>My short bio:<p>About this time last year, GradFly was only a couple months old.  I raised a small seed round, incorporated the business (which I thought had no legs), and had just brought on our first hire.  I&#x27;ve been checking out Reddit for some time and have received some good feedback from the rapid prototyping community which will contine to grow.<p>What is GradFly?<p>We are building an online community and repository for hardware/software projects - from Arduino, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, drones, version control for PCBs,  to designs in sync with code, etc. Basically, hardware and software developers join forces to work on specific hardware projects. (Say John Smith posts a project to have two arduinos communicate using WiFi Direct and he is seeking help on the WiFi part while he focuses on the motor controller stuff.)  He is willing to pay $350 to have someone work with him in parallel and speed up the project. Anyone can submit a project. We help faciliate connections and find resources, talent, and example projects to help with products or concepts that the community is trying to create.<p>Current stats: (We are still a very young company)<p>Based in Buffalo, NY\n400+ users (mostly early adopters);\nSome revenue but recently changed models to accomodate user growth;\nTeam of 2;\nCurrently part of Startup Next Toronto (Sponsored by Google Entrepreneurs);\nWaitlisted at TechStars NYC this past summer. (Made top 15);\nPartners with maker spaces, fablabs, diybio communities, and garage type groups;\nJust finished raising $700k.  (raised  $200k last year)<p>As you can see, I&#x27;m pretty transparent about things like this.  I like to keep everyting out in the open.<p>My Background:<p>Worked in Western NY for the last five years before founding GradFly.  Started in grants, college admissions, and makerspaces before throwing in the towel to become founder.  Learned to code Python on CodeAcademy and have since been improving over time. Just started tinkering with Arduino and Hummingbird. I row and swim competitvely to keep my sanity. I also speak Spanish and French.<p>Who I&#x27;m looking for:<p>Up until now, I&#x27;ve relied mostly on part-time and student developer talent to help me build GradFly. I&#x27;ve been grateful but with this recent fundraise, I need to raise the bar a tad bit.  I&#x27;m looking for folks who can and want to commit full-time to an early-stage company with room for growth and various opportunities.  I&#x27;m also looking for individuals that are passionate about where the open hardware/software movement is heading. It&#x27;s hard to try and explain it to someone if they&#x27;re not immersed in it already. I&#x27;ve done the whole remote thing and it didn&#x27;t work out - therefore I&#x27;m looking for someone who would be willing to relocate given the right package and circumstances. I can be flexible for someone who is very curious and wants to spend a little of time figuring out a move like this.<p>All in all, I&#x27;m looking for three people:<p>1) Lead Engineer, potential CTO - (Backend) - The site is Python backend in flask using s3 for asset storage along with rabbitmq and celery for messaging and tasks. We are using redis and Postgres for temp storage/caching and database respectively.  Currently on github using wrecker for CI and builds to deploy to heroku - where everything is hosted. We&#x27;re looking for someone who is familiar with these stacks yet is willing to push the envelope and try new things. The foundation is there, now we just need to build on top of it.<p>2) Frontend Engineer/Designer - Frontend is built with grunt and is split between foundation and bootstrap templates with jinja2.  Styling is done in less and stylus, and we&#x27;re using plain old JavaScript and jquery.  The design on the site currently lacks but it&#x27;s only uphill from here. We have ideas about what we&#x27;d like to see but we&#x27;re open to different kinds of aesthetics out there.<p>3) Marketing/Business Dev - Really looking for someone who has an understanding of this space and knows how to build a community and identify the right channels for hypergrowth.  So far we&#x27;ve been presenting at all types of events (makerfaires, trade showes, fablabs), reaching out to influencers, and spreading more awareness about ourselves.  The person who joins us on this end would continue to help us address the number one pain point we&#x27;re addressing.  Must be willing to travel across US, Europe, and Asia.<p>PM me with your portfolio.  Really looking forward to connecting with anyone that this might resonate with.<p>Thanks in advance for reading. I know this was long.<p>Oscar<p>@oscar_pedroso\noscar at gradfly dot co",1418318226

If you heard a song then you were free to sing it to your friends, make performances of it or whatever.<p>On the DRM point, the works that are &quot;protected&quot; can&#x27;t freely enter the public domain. The copyright deal is that the people will - via the government - grant you a monopoly on reproduction/modification (and associated actions) on your work for a limited period in exchange for the work entering the public domain. In order to enter the public domain a work should be free to be enjoyed by all without let or hindrance (beyond that inherent in the format). The point of the DRM is to ensure that the work is never able to be freely used/copied etc., it can&#x27;t enter the public domain unless it is side-loaded in some way and I can&#x27;t see any current media corp paying for archiving of all works DRM free and then releasing them at the appropriate time to ensure they keep their end of the bargain.

This is one of the most clear online presentations of what the Flynn effect is all about. (By contrast, the Wikipedia article is still TERRIBLE.) Contrary to what the second comment posted says, Flynn is a very highly regarded researcher on psychology. Arthur Jensen wrote in 1987, in his festschrift <i>Arthur Jensen: Consensus and Controversy</i> &quot;Now and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind. His book, <i>Race, IQ and Jensen</i> (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.&quot; And Charles Murray, surviving author of <i>The Bell Curve,</i> wrote in his back cover description of Flynn&#x27;s 2007 book <i>What Is Intelligence?</i> &quot;This book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work, much of which was new to me. All of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that Flynn discusses are in his debt.&quot;<p>Not everyone knows yet that IQ test scores have been rising steadily around the world throughout the century when IQ tests have been in common use in the developed world. Further gains in IQ are expected in most developing countries, although some developed countries (notably, those in Scandinavia) may be seeing the end of this trend. This phenomenon of IQ test scores rising over time (&quot;secular increase in intelligence,&quot; from the point of view of psychologists) is these days called &quot;the Flynn effect&quot; since Herrnstein and Murray referred to it that way in the 1994 book <i>The Bell Curve</i>. That terminology has become mainstream because Flynn was the researcher who did the most to raise awareness of the phenomenon and confirm it across data sets from all over the world. Flynn had some important publications in the flagship psychology research journal in the United States, <i>Psychological Bulletin,</i>[1] that are widely cited to this day. The 2006 lecture text linked here is Flynn discussing the implications of the rise of IQ scores, what they mean for the definition of human intelligence and what societal changes we can expect to go along with rising IQ.<p>AFTER EDIT: I don&#x27;t fully agree with Flynn&#x27;s political opinions, but he expresses them very thoughtfully, while introducing a lot of interesting data I don&#x27;t see often mentioned in other books on social policy, in his book <i>Where Have All the Liberals Gone?</i>[2] I liked that book a lot better and learned more from it than I expected to.<p>[1] Flynn, J.

Most liberals today insist on simultaneously ignoring the reality of heritable inequality and taking a naturalistic-fallacy based position against any form of human augmentation or genetic tinkering. &quot;No GMO!&quot; The total takeover of the &quot;left&quot; by naturalistic fallacy thinking is insane.<p>Where in nature do we see equality, fairness, or an active attempt to uplift the disadvantaged outside of very small family and kin groups?

It was directed by a nobody with 3 other mediocre films under his belt and written by a novice writer.  It really has &quot;pet indie project of a wealthy person or two&quot; written all over it.

The reason we build abstractions, which Java allows perfectly, is so that we can ignore the hidden complexity and reason about code more easily.<p>Go explicitly makes it difficult to hide underlying complexity. If I want to make, for example, a Bimap (which Java has many clean implementations of) I get to pick from two poisons in Go: Either I must force everyone who uses it to type-cast on every get (implement the bimap via taking and returning interface{}), or I must surface the implementation details (two maps) and have users directly manipulate those since the builtin uni-directional map is a type-safe generic data-structure which I can&#x27;t replicate in the language itself. This might look appealing at first, but since I also need to do some Locking my interface for allowing people to manipulate those maps directly rapidly becomes troublesome.<p>Neither of those choices sound appealing to me.<p>Honestly, if you want to avoid java now you have a plethora of options.

That&#x27;s fundamentally what our economy runs on. You could argue that some people take advantage of this on the top, but the vast majority of any economy is based on people doing work. The dollar is backed by the US government. When you go to a store and say you want to buy something, they have to take your money. In fact it&#x27;s illegal for someone to not accept legal tender. That is the value of the dollar.<p>So now you say, but the US government isn&#x27;t anyone special. Countries come and go in dominance, why is the dollar worth more than any other currency? Because their really is no other country with which everyone else wants to trade with on a massive scale. Americans are willing to give more money for work than any other country, so it is in other countries best interest to take dollars, which in turn increases the demand for said dollar.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be useful for a digital currency like bitcoin to replace all of that? Not really, unless it has actual ties with actual money. A digital currency&#x27;s only real value is being able to send and receive money, fast. But once it gets wherever, it still has to be converted back to the local currency. Gold and other commodities have physical values with physical properties than can physically do things. That in itself makes them have a base value, when they go up or down, that&#x27;s just the market being the market.<p>You could start talking about how more companies (like Microsoft) are accepting bitcoin, so potentially you&#x27;ll never have to convert it back to local currency but that conversation leads to the dollar being essentially worthless and the US government could collapse any minute and you should save all your money in bitcoin.

I don&#x27;t think you can point to the rich people in Hollywood and say &quot;They have enough money already, they can afford to lose some people to torrents&quot; because for every rich actor/screenwriter/producer, there are 100 other entertainment workers that don&#x27;t make $100,000 per episode.",1418317326

I&#x27;m in the same boat (to build a language) and this is a bit closer to it (I will add -hopefully- pattern matching, union types, a relational algebra).<p>Suggestions (I have read now dozens of things like this):<p>- Something that is not made clear with interpreters is: I need a garbage collector? What happened with memory?<p>- I haven&#x27;t see how manage imports/modules. Look like all the toy interpreters are for run everything at once.<p>- Any hint in how improve error messages at parsing, if possible.. That depend in what use to parse it..<p>- Know how do math is nice, but I have wonder, what are the minimun necessary of functions to lift from the host language to make possible to build the standard library from INSIDE the interpreter? So, print is built-in, but maybe map and list?<p>- I see the introductory post, and think could be nice to support at least List/Arrays (ie a container of things).<p>- The interpreter code I have seen, in the AST processing have the tendency of be hard to read (with single letters vars and things like that), so consider that too.<p>Looking forward to your series!",1418317295

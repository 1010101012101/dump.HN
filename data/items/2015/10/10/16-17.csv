It&#x27;s only &quot;perfectly&quot; partitionable if that distribution is perfectly uniform.<p>Twitter&#x27;s traffic patterns are power-laws. Some tags vastly outnumber others. Some users have vastly more followers. Those distributions are unstable across time and space in surprisingly short order.<p>> <i>Twitter had the resources to do it better from very early on, and they didn&#x27;t (I think it was 2012 or so before Twitter became reliable).</i><p>Twitter wasn&#x27;t interested in a contest to use the least hardware. They were in a race to keep up with surging load, while migrating from Rails to something that didn&#x27;t exist yet. Meanwhile they have, under the hood, built infrastructure that could not be bought off the shelf from anyone at the time.<p>We can&#x27;t actually come to a conclusion here, because you&#x27;re arguing a counterfactual. It&#x27;s always easy to have the ideal solution to a problem you never actually solved yourself, because the visible features of a problem are obvious and the many, many invisible problems are where the bulk of the effort are hiding.<p>If you want to prove that Twitter doesn&#x27;t need such large and complex distributed systems, you can probably round up a few hundred thousand in angel funding and sell yourself to Twitter for a nice return.",1444495968

IMHO this is the most important item: &quot;We have yet to solve caching GraphQL responses on the client.&quot;<p>Mobile client-side caching and sync/refreshing (or client-side change push) is where users get big gains in perceived speed gains. Fielding&#x27;s REST handles this well, in my experience, though it takes some work to get the resource granularity correct, especially as a mobile app&#x27;s feature needs are changing.<p>In my experience it&#x27;s often the case that the mobile app can benefit from Fielding&#x27;s REST (with HATEOS) and from using resources that are mobile-specific and quite different than the out-of-the box server-side models that map 1:1 to database rows. As an example, the JSON API team describes how to nest resources efficiently and cacheably, and also send HATEOS links.<p>I&#x27;ll be very interested to hear more about your next steps, including how you decide to do caching, puts, and any kind of pub/sub or equivalent.

We could cut out a big chunk by getting rid of farm subsidies. My wife (went to high school and college in Iowa) doesn&#x27;t think that&#x27;s acceptable. We could simplify by getting rid of all the handouts for older people (mortgage interest deduction). My parents, who save tens of thousands in taxes each year from their McMansion, don&#x27;t like that idea. I&#x27;d love to have a flat tax with no brackets. But my liberal friends like the whole progressive taxation thing. The tax code is a soup but it&#x27;s one that reflects an equilibrium of all these interests.<p>Also, the idea of government creating a complex tax code just for funsies is naive. The tax code is huge because accounting is complicated, and taxation is basically a superset of accounting. The GAAP rules are 25,000 pages. That&#x27;s probably the lower bound in how much you can simplify the tax code (without incorporating the GAAP by reference, which basically would outsource writing tax law to a private organization).",1444492885

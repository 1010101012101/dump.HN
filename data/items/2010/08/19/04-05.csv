The word 'thread' is so overloaded that I'm not sure it's helpful here.<p>Yes, operating systems frequently allow processes to share the same data space, and we call these 'threads'.  Yes, CPU's allow multiple code paths to be in progress on the same core, and we also call these 'threads'.  And as the the author knows (based on the replies to comments), neither of these really constrains the form 'threads' take at the level the programmer thinks about.<p>So I'm not sure what use there is in concluding that threads ""not going anywhere"".  This is trivially true to the extent that 'threads' are synonymous with 'concurrency', but does it say more than ""concurrency is here to stay""?",1282193545

The label and highlighted of the code is definitely a very good suggestion.<p>Initially I thought of introducing voting at first like HN and Reditt. But as in the initial stage difficult to get the traction of site, it all vote will look zero. So chosen views instead which gives me little motivation :) but one downside I seen using the views, it get updated by each bot. So I updated program not to update view count by the different bots. But definitely I am thinking a lot how to come up with better rating or voting system to make the content little bit structured as well so that a new user can read in one sequence. Also review of description I too thought about this and trying out some mock. But now I am trying to get some beta user or some community around it. Based on their feedback, I will try to implement some review system for the description.<p>Translation I didn't thought yet. But really if someone write in our native language we will be more happy.

Flag everything political-sounding, and have it (reasonably accurately) filtered - no more FUD chain letters in your main inbox!  Flag anything funny - get a humor folder.  Flag everything that's a bug report - get a bug report folder.  Ultimately, you have an auto-sorting tagging system defined by your needs.<p>I'm primarily thinking it'd work for people with high-to-very-high email volume, as then the filters would have enough to learn from.

Company spends less on office space. Developers get interrupted less and so can stay in productivity zones longer. Employees spend less time and money on non-productive & never-ending activities (commuting) and experience less health risk (car accidents) and cause less air & noise pollution (driving). I also suspect (though not 100% positive) it will put downward pressure on the number of middle managers needed, and thus save companies even more. Employees still need to be ""managed"" but if all the worker bees are remote than there is less cover and opportunity for managers to create makework and timesinks solely to help justify their own jobs.",1282192462

Sometimes it would be nice to see how the code functions as part of a larger program, so you could organize snippets by length and by what other snippets it connects to.<p>Large snippets can have labels on different parts of the code, the specific function might be two lines in the middle, and could be highlighted or labeled. Sometimes small functionality, like changing CSS with javascript is part of a larger function like onClick. A snippet could be for those two things at once and each thing could be highlighted differently.<p>You could build a rating system for snippets instead of curating them manually. Novice users could say this snippet helped me, and experienced coders could say this snippet is good practice, this not so good. You could also do that for descriptions, get people with good english to rate descriptions, have them suggest improvements to grammar, make them shorter, add versions for expert users or novice users etc.. Each description could be translated to multiple languages as well, seems like something that would help people in your shoes.<p>You could also organize snippets as a part of a larger program. A program could:<p>1. Access a database<p>2. Find all users in a table<p>3. Add something to each user.<p>Another program might:<p>1. Access a database<p>2. Find users who do Javascript<p>3.

Yet each copy would be a fully conscious person and would immediately diverge into its own individual from the shared point on.<p>This of course sounds like a contradiction, both are you and both are individuals? That's because our language and concepts just don't have the muscle for this situation. ""Both are you"" is short-hand since the wold ""you"" becomes ill-defined or at least radically transformed.

Computers aren't ""dumb"" -- they just don't share our language, culture, biases, etc.  You have to specify everything exactly.  If anyone has to be dumb, it's going to have to be us.  Evolution helped us make sense of the complexity with a bunch of highly complex and very leaky abstractions -- ""person"", ""God"", ""love"", ""nature"", ""property"", ""fairness"", ""consent"" etc.  Only when you try to describe these concepts to a clean slate such as a computer do you realize how complex the world really is.

3976105,comment,3973019,3975831,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>This maybe just me - but most of the problems I've had when I started a company for the first time (and second, and ...) are with the business skills not the technical ones.</i><p>Fair point, but right now the business world (in VC-istan) is loopy and you might learn the wrong things-- things that are only true at the peak of a bubble.<p>I know someone who had a startup in the late '90s. He didn't know what he was doing and never should have been funded. He ended up raising about $50 million. Being CEO of a transiently important company went to his head, the tide went out, and he crashed and burned. It's 13 years later and he still hasn't emotionally recovered. All of his subsequent effort has failed because he wants his late-90s startup back. This sort of emotional pollution can be obvious or it can be subtle. I think most people get affected by some amount of it over their careers-- usually the more subtle kind. Loopy, style-over-substance business environments where clowns are made kings are ripe grounds to take in emotional pollution, and it's harder to resist that than people think.<p><i>Maybe starting a new business now, in the face of almost certain total and abject failure, is just what the doctor ordered</i><p>Right now, the issue isn't that there isn't money to be made in startups. There is. But the environment is congested and therefore noisy rather than meritocratic and that tends to teach people the wrong lessons.<p>In times of congestion, social connections win. What this means is that 90% of what is being funded is raising money because of who the founders know, not what their ideas are. If you try to imitiate their ideas, you're learning the wrong lessons. If you want to be a startup founder, you're better off figuring out what you need to do to have more VC connections in 5 years, and that may or may not be starting your own company.<p>As I said, learning the wrong thing is more dangerous than sitting a bubble out and doing something else, and emotional pollution is a cause of the former experience. The late-bubble danger isn't an ""everyone loses"" abject failure; it's that you might watch unqualified people win, while losing, and start (possibly subconsciously) picking up the attitudes and approaches of those winners, which might not suit you later when substance becomes king again.",1337082654

3976079,story,,,2,2,elisk,"Working with freelancers and telecommuting employers is a pain",,"Some of you may find this situation familiar: You need something done, you post a job description - either a one time freelancer that will do the designated task or a full time employee that is going to work with you telecommuting - you get a bunch of applicants, you work for a couple of weeks trying to find the right person, explaining the project in details, answering the same questions over and over, and eventually settling on someone.<p>The first couple of days everything works well, but a week or two down the road you begin to notice first communication breakdown - emails are ignored, tasks are pending, and the developer? not answering his skype for 10 days straight. Is he dead? did he abandon the project? No idea, just you with a half of the work done, and some money that you will never see again.<p>After five-six weeks you start the process all over again.<p>I've been there countless times, on both sides, and it always looks the same, you pay the money, a few weeks go by, features are not coming in as fast as you initially expected, and the dev starts loosing interest as time goes by - no face to look at in the morning means you can simply ignore the person. Not a fun way of doing business.<p>What is needed is some kind of a freelance report card - where employees and employers can post their own experience working with the other party, think of it as linkedin with employees/employers keeping tabs on one another. Item delivered on time? that's +5 points, two weeks late? that's -10 points. Your client haven't paid in 6 weeks? that's -50 points.<p>At first it will need to build up reputation and network - but once the network is sufficiently large, both sides will go to this report card to check on future employees/employers to see how well they worked in the past. No score on a particular freelancer? it might not be that good of a deal to make.<p>Good freelancers/employees will work harder to maintain their report card, and will request from employers to post a report.<p>You might say ""But that's what Elance is for"", wrong - elance is a platform designed to maximize profits for themselves - they care not for the employees nor the employers, and if you've ever worked with a freelancer from Elance you know that the scoring system there is not really genuine, and people (freelancers) often change names when they get bad rep and continue onward.<p>To fix this, the freelancer report card should care only about creating profiles of work-providers and work-consumers, with full on details about the person as much as required - Facebook, LinkedId, past clients, past employees, and sincere commenting/scoring that would require users to provide genuine information about themselves, and work to maintain their report card in good condition.<p>Reporting on employees/employers would require connecting at least one social network profile, and I think that the ""quality"" and ""trustworthiness"" of a particular profile would be calculated based on the number of ""positive"" connections that link to the profile - if you plugin a fake facebook account with 2-3 friends, and zero users in the report card system, you won't get a high score, but the more social networks you plugin, the more active it is, the more followers it has, and the more users are linked both in the system and in your social network the higher score you'll get.<p>""Unregistered"" users will still be reported on - so if you work with a freelancer that isn't registered to the system, you still can report on them, providing social network handles and some review details. The only thing that ""registered"" users can do is to report on others and attach different social graphs to the report card.<p>I'd like to hear your opinion on this, and answer questions if you have them.",1337082186

The government is cutting costs especially on the social cost side for a decade now, they have not been Keynes spenders in any way.<p>Economy growth in the last years came from massive social cuts, restructuring employment laws, increasing the minimum pension age over several years (will be 67 in 2012), cutting early pension programs and cost cutting in companies.

Here's my best shot.<p>One can regret actions one performed, or actions one didn't perform. If you were to express such regret for either, it'd be deemed an apology.<p>Strictly speaking, ""regret"" doesn't imply that could you relive the moment, you would have acted differently.

I agree that it's not ""essential"" and not <i>everyone</i> should do it, but it's still more valuable than I think Attwood gives credit for.<p>I'm perhaps in a unique position to comment, having recently taught my girlfriend to program. So I can talk about how that played out.<p>My girlfriend understands menus, she knows about links, she can install software, she can use word, she can type away like no other, and even fix some problems. If you watched her using a computer it'd seem like she had a pretty good affinity with this black box.<p>However, I don't think most programmers realize what a holistic approach the average person (even a relatively tech savvy one) takes to computers. They only understand them at the highest level. They develop fetishes and incantations to fix things. When something goes wrong my girlfriend will turn the computer on an off. She'll turn the router on and off. Etc. Or just click ""ok"" until it stops complaining. It often fixes the problem, but it's just something she's learned to do with little understanding. She goes to the store and can pick out a decent phone or laptop, but only because she's developed an intuitive semi-understanding of the lingo. This one has more gigs, that's better...etc.<p>The computer will do things they don't understand, except some vague notion that the computer is ""dumb"".<p>I asked her one time how a computer works because I was legitimately curious how people without any instruction in comp sci etc visualize it. She had absolutely no idea of even the most fundamental workings of a computer except that it had something vaguely to do with ""ones and zeros"".<p>I taught her binary. I taught her boolean logic. I showed her binary math. I gave a very basic example of how you can use circuits to do binary math. I made her sit at a desk and act as a processor. Then I explained the concept of bootstrapping.<p>Then I taught her a little bit of Python.<p>Enlightenment.<p>She understands garbage in - garbage out. She understands dependencies. She understands algorithmic complexity. She understands types and formatting...and much more. (at least generally, which is enough).<p>This mysterious box no longer seems capricious and opaque. She has a much better understanding of why her computer behaves the way it does and therefore feels more at ease. Sure she can't magically fix anything, but she's recognizing general patterns more and more.<p>She installed Ubuntu recently in fact, and has started writing Python scripts (and Bash!) to assist in assorted data processing tasks she used to do by hand. When my girlfriend needed to update batches of reports, she would up each one BY HAND and change them. Using a computer was frustrating and scary. Learning coding won't improve her life? Seriously?<p>Would it make him a better mayor? Not necessarily but it sure could help. I'm sure he uses a computer and I'm willing to bet the less time the mayor spends screwing around with a computer or waiting for tech support the better. Likewise, I'm sure he has all sorts of tedious tasks which don't warrant third party software but which could be tackled by a nice Perl script. That doesn't even take into account the boost in (general) analytical thinking that comes from programming. Ditto for potential refreshment in Math.<p>Who says it needs to make him a better Mayor anyway? What if he just wants to be a better person?<p>In addition to being a programmer, I happen to be a musician as well...which puts me into contact with a lot of artists. I'm always surprised by how much they could benefit learning programming because a lot of art involves hacking; creating weird one off contraptions...often requiring lots of tedious work. Many want to experiment with technology and art, but are unsure how. Processing could blow some minds. Ditto Overtone.<p>Using a computer is largely about software; and software is similar to arts and crafts in that it's a reflection of the creator and the tools they used.<p>Learning about an artist helps you interpret the meaning of their work. Learning about the techniques help you evaluate and appreciate their work.<p>Learning to code makes you sympathize with the people who wrote the software you use. It helps you understand how software is put together. Which is good, because the more you sympathize with the author and the more you understand how it fits together the easier time you will have using it.<p>To be fair there are <i>a lot</i> of things I feel everyone should learn. I think it's fair to say though that out of all the ones you could pick, learning to program will be more beneficial practically relative to most others.<p>>     Research voraciously, and understand how the things around us work at a basic level.\n    Communicate effectively with other human beings.<p>I think this is the heart of the misunderstanding between sides. Learning to program is actually the first step in that. He mentions having ""basic internet skills"" as a necessary life skill. Learning some programming will greatly facilitate that.<p>Likewise programming will introduce concepts and develop skills that help you understand technology in general. It even helps in in non-technological areas. It facilitates communication because it forces you to confront and think about how difficult it is to communicate certain things clearly.",1337080536

Let's talk about something different:<p>> But understanding variables and functions, pointers and recursion? I can't see it.<p>Hey, I'd argue that understanding <i>exactly those</i> things are what should be included in ""everyone should learn to code"". All of those are difficult mental constructs important for understanding how our complex world works. Let's look at it case-by-case:<p>variables - this is basic; the idea to take something (a concept) in your hand and manipulate it by a symbolic name. This is, in some way, taught in high-school math, but somehow many people don't seem to grasp the idea behind the concept of a variable.<p>functions - ability to take a set of instruction and name it. Possibly have it parametrized. That's simple. But naming several sets of concepts, and then using them to build another layer of concepts, which is then used to build another layer of concepts... I'd call this an essencial problem-solving skill.<p>pointers - concept of indirection; for people not accustomed to it, it's easy to get lost in different levels of indirection when discussing things\n(like, a difference between 'belief' and 'belief in belief', or P, proof of P, proof that P is provable, etc.)<p>recursion - because not everything circular is invalid; sometimes things defined in the terms of themselves are the simplest way to go.<p>To all of this I'd also add one more, IMO essencial, thing - understanding of <i>feedback loops</i>. It could cut out a lot of discussions about whether X causes Y, or Y causes X. Surprise surprise, it might be a <i>feedback loop</i>, in which X and Y are interlocked, and are both to blame.<p>Bottomline, programming teaches us a lot of important skills and mental constructs useful for problem-solving and understanding how the world works. And those skills are hard to get elsewhere.<p>A silly example from high-school biology: what is genetic code if not opcodes for protein assembly machinery? DNA ""data"" is code that programs machines building proteins. Easy to understand and remember if you know even a little bit about how 'automation'/'computing' is done.",1337080185

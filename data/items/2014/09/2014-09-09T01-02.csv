That&#x27;s going to affect any baseline distances.<p>We can get a much longer baseline in space than on the Moon. LISA and DECIGO give some idea of how accurate we can expect to measure a baseline that is over 1 million km long. There&#x27;s no way the Moon can match that baseline, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.<p>Labeyrie has proposed a 100-kilometer space-based &#x27;Hypertelescope&#x27; that might be able to directly see continents on planets up to 10 light years away. I strongly suspect this is harder to pull off on the Moon, which has gravity, vibrations, and every-changing thermal stresses messing up the interferometry.<p>I think you are confusing two different telescope projects. Liquid-based mirrors are for optical telescopes, which aren&#x27;t affected by radio interference. While there are proposals for 20m-100m liquid mirrors on the Moon, they have the big problem that they can&#x27;t be pointed; it seems to be more cool than useful, as the lack of research for projects on Earth like the Large Zenith Telescope suggests.<p>While there&#x27;s some advantage to using the Moon as a radio shield, the WP page at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon</a> points out other difficulties in addition to the simple difficulties you pointed out:<p>> Before deploying radio telescopes to the far side, several problems must be overcome. The fine lunar dust can contaminate equipment, vehicles, and space suits. The conducting materials used for the radio dishes must also be carefully shielded against the effects of solar flares. Finally the area around the telescopes must be protected against contamination by other radio sources.<p>As an alternative, the radio telescope can be built in lunar orbit, as, for example, the OLFAR proposal at <a href=""http://doc.utwente.nl/75270/1/Smallsat_final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.utwente.nl/75270/1/Smallsat_final.pdf</a> .

If you are not from the UK, you might be unfamiliar with the UK press, but there is a tremendous bias towards the establishment and they are very good at pressing the right buttons.

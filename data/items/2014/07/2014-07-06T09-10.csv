7994158,comment,7981725,7981725,1,0,richsin,,,"A few things to think about:<p>1. Everything is negotiable, try to work it in your favor to not have to choose. If your going to lead a company, negotiation is a good skill to pick up.<p>2. I have always felt there is far too much anxiety around technology/startups ... will it be there when I arrive? Will I still be relevant? Urgency is great when you jump in, but rest assure it will be here when you come back, if you choose to take the time off.<p>3. Do you want to run from regret or follow your heart?<p>4. Put your degree as a priority unless you are absolutely passionate about what you are postponing it for. As a 30 year old drop-out, sure it&#x27;s nice when you have money to walk around and look like a genius because your successful, but it brings on additional insecurity and uncertainty when you do not have that paper behind your name on the way up. How much time do you spend climbing vs. time spent at the peak? Prepare yourself for the climb.<p>5. Take the trip, discuss your flexibility, listen to the idea, take time to evaluate. When an idea connects with you, the question changes from &quot;what should i do?&quot; to &quot;how do i make this happen?&quot;<p>Lot&#x27;s of great advice from the others also. Good luck none the less, you have two really exciting paths in front of you, so its already a win-win.",1404640737

7994129,comment,7993482,7994011,1,0,jzwinck,,,"I made some speakers when I was in high school.  The tools I used were a table saw, a whole bunch of long clamps, a screwdriver, and a hand drill.  But most important, this book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Building-Speaker-Systems-2nd-Edition/dp/B000THVC3S"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Building-Speaker-Systems-2nd-Edition/d...</a> .  If you buy it used now you will find it hilarious how they describe using computer software to analyze speaker systems, but no matter: you can stand on the shoulders of giants and design your own boxes without any software at all.<p>The &quot;D&#x27;Appolito array&quot; is covered in that book--a design employed in many store-bought speakers where two mid-woofers flank a tweeter at a specific distance to avoid some of the time alignment concerns raised here.  This is a good candidate if you want to build smallish, narrow speakers for home.  In the car it usually comes down to &quot;where is there enough room for the drivers I want?&quot;<p>I think the book also discusses various dual-driver arrangements for subwoofers, which is another interesting area where you can use twin drivers to eliminate undesirable effects.  If you put that together with the D&#x27;Appolito design in a single cabinet, you will have something like what Infinity used to sell for $1000 each...but doing it well won&#x27;t save you much money because good drivers are expensive.",1404639190

7994111,comment,7993773,7993773,8,0,PeterGriffin,,,"> &quot;Counter-intuitively, Koubeissi&#x27;s team found that the woman&#x27;s loss of consciousness was associated with increased synchrony of electrical activity, or brainwaves, in the frontal and parietal regions of the brain that participate in conscious awareness. Although different areas of the brain are thought to synchronise activity to bind different aspects of an experience together, too much synchronisation seems to be bad. The brain can&#x27;t distinguish one aspect from another, stopping a cohesive experience emerging.&quot;<p>Right, counter-intuitively... As long as we&#x27;ll be making up reasons based on that piece of data, how about this:<p>Global synchrony occurs when a brain is recovering from an unknown or detected bad state, and all major parts of the brain say &quot;HLO&quot; to each other to notify for their existence, proper operation and to establish connection. So it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s bad to be synchronous, but the lack of information from critical parts of the brain causes it to repeatedly reboot in order to recover from a bad state forced by electric rods in the brain.<p>Hey, I&#x27;m a scientist!<p>Seriously though, why aren&#x27;t we thinking about what the implications of our experimental data would be on a <i>distributed computing system</i>, which our brain is, instead of giving silly &quot;it&#x27;s like the key in a car&quot; explanations, assigning causality randomly and without merit?",1404637867

But give the same instructions to someone who has never done dishes and you quickly see the problem. It goes the other way too. I dare you to try and explain a simple repeating algorithm in prose. No lists or numberings allowed.<p>Simple recursions work exactly the same as the equivalent iterations. They branch on a condition, execute a step and repeat. How state is handled is the key difference. As Haskell has no concept of a variable, the only way to rebind a name is to recall a function.<p>I was going to say that a professional in our field who has problems with recursion and the basics of discrete math should take a look in the mirror.

I dunno. It just does.<p>Presumably it just sends itself to the object you pass in? This is not something I&#x27;m actually bothered by.<p>I guess it depends on how you extend classes you don&#x27;t own. If the adapters themselves are modular and are only loaded with the class that they&#x27;re trying to adapt to, that might be OK. In other words, if I have a DatabaseConnection class that extends other classes with asDatabaseConnection methods, and that extension only happens when I load the DatabaseConnection class, that still satisfies the intention of SRP even though I&#x27;m technically implementing methods on other classes.",1388339900

S. government has decided that who they classify as terrorists superceding the rights of a US citizen, this is just wrong.  Communicating with terrorists on a typical basis isn&#x27;t enough for the U. S. government to do so - the only cases where I have heard of this happening is when the US citizen in question has carried out actual violent terrorist actions such as armed combat.<p>You have far less protection against the U. S. government if you are not a citizen, since there is nothing protecting you against broad actions.  You can be assassinated in the middle of the night & your government wouldn&#x27;t be able to do a damn thing to pre-empt that.

I do not remember the exact words, but when asked about allied air superiority with drones, an insurgent commander responded &quot;Talking to people, I can get a few people to join my side. With one drone strike, I can get a whole village on my side.&quot; And herein lies the problem: for every insurgent a drone strike kills, whether he deserves it or not, that drone stroke motivates many more to join their ranks.<p>After a flood, the Taliban helped to rebuild villages in Pakistan. People felt that the state did nothing for them, thus again strengthening support for the insurgency. I feel as though, if the US instead invested the money from war to rather rebuilding, infrastructure, healthcare, education, that the insurgency would fade on its own.<p>People join the insurgency because they are motivated by hate and anger. Attempting to eliminate it through extermination is futile: the collateral damage only multiples the numbers wanting to fight.

Having looked at a number of civilian think tank studies into the issue, even if you come up with a statistic like 3 militants killed per civilian (as reported in some studies) it is very hard to say how that compares to other methods, or if alternatives even exist. Most of the comparisons in support of drone ops are to the wholesale target:CIVCAS for the entire ground forces, which of course is inflated by actual engagements with enemies.<p>I think we should look at this in terms of whether or not we should even be operating with outright force in the hinterlands of Yemen or AfPak, where there are very high concentrations of civilians. &quot;Kinetic operations&quot; with high explosives are, in my opinion, highly inappropriate for dealing with insurgents hidden among the population.

Most of it is sent by your browser in the request headers, and the font detection used Flash and Java. They could have used JavaScript to detect fonts as a fall-back when Java and Flash are disabled, but it&#x27;s relatively complicated to do so (requiring you to know the rendered width of a string for each font you&#x27;re trying to detect), and it was not included in this example.<p>Sending incorrect information for Java or Flash fonts is an interesting idea, and likely would not affect user experience, as non-standard fonts are often served with the animations. Sending the wrong screen size might get you a mobile site served when you were wanting non-mobile or vice-versa.

I found that that when compiling code, the result was often one of three things: one, type checking failed (or I got an inexhaustive match warning), and I got a useful message, two, it worked, and three, it failed but the problem was fairly obvious when I saw it. Functional programming, for me, is a fairly direct way of expressing the algorithm in my head, so the basic idea tends to be much more fully fleshed out the first time I write it down in code.<p>Sometimes I got a type error from some bizzare syntax mistake, usually failing to correctly delineate an expression, and sometimes the algorithm in my head was just wrong and I had to fix it. At that point, the cycle starts over, and the same benefits I mentioned above help in debugging. FWIW, the problem I was working on was fairly simple, but novel.

If you protect your free hours and limit your work hours, you&#x27;ll feel more pressure to be productive during work hours.<p>When we work at a company, we limit how much the company gets to use us during our free time. We typically give them a set number of hours a week and focus on being productive for them during those work hours. Sometimes we work extra hours (especially entrepreneurs), but we usually expect to be rewarded for sacrificing our personal time. But if we work for ourselves (or on projects with less oversight), we get the freedom to set our own working hours. And suddenly it feels as though we have an abundance of time to get work done (&quot;I can always finish this tonight over over the weekend&quot;). Ironically, this can make us less productive, because it becomes easier to procrastinate.<p>So as many are saying, set a schedule and set boundaries around your work hours. And make it a schedule that works best for your habits and lifestyle. But also set rules about when you are not working. Set boundaries that help you define when you&#x27;re willing to work extra hours (eg, on a coding spree) and the rewards you will give yourself in return (eg, take Friday off, generate extra revenue to buy X).

Failing that, mark the start and end of your work day in some semi-formal way.  When I was managing a team of people working from home I instituted the following policy, which seemed to work really well: when you decide it&#x27;s time to &quot;show up&quot; for work, send an email to the team saying, &quot;I&#x27;m in&quot;, and a one or two sentence description of what you&#x27;re working on that day.  When you&#x27;re done for the day, send another email saying, &quot;I&#x27;m out&quot; and another one or two sentence description of what you actually managed to get done.  Just that little bit of structure made a huge difference.  If you don&#x27;t have a team, then collect a group of other self-employed-working-from-home people to be mutually accountable to.

Why do we treat our data differently?</i><p>All mainstream database products allow you to retain the entire history of every change ever made in the form of transaction logs. With those logs you can recover your database to any specific point in time, and to unwind specific transactions.<p>Of course most discard transaction logs because the volumes tend to be huge in many mainstream, operating databases. I worked on one system where the main database barely pushed 10GB, but there were 100s of GBs of transaction logs generated daily.<p>However the core reason that mainstream databases discard with historical data is performance, not size -- if your current users overwhelmingly only care about the current state of the data, and it is rare that you need to go back into the past (which is what transaction logs and snapshots provide), paying an extremely high performance penalty to retain all of that historical data does not pay off. And there are no immutable products that offer similar performance to mainstream products under most usage scenarios, instead forcing you into extremely confined uses.<p><i>It&#x27;d be nice to not suffer scornful surface criticisms from people who base their career around the status quo.</i><p>This is a garbage non sequitur, as an aside. It is a disgraceful attempt -- as so commonly happens in such discussion -- to try to attach agenda to an opinion that one doesn&#x27;t like.",1388336667

6980188,comment,6979530,6979726,1,0,actsasbuffoon,,,"The biggest reason that audio software/hardware manufacturers tend to ignore Windows is its latency problems. Latency is the amount of time it takes to send input to the system, or to get output from the system. Total latency is the combination of the two; how long it takes from the time I pluck a string until I hear the processed version play back through my headphones. High latency throws your timing off. It&#x27;s a lot like when you speak into a microphone in an auditorium and the delay between when you speak and when you hear your voice is confusing.<p>The two primary audio APIs available on Windows have very high latency, to the point where they make tracking with effects virtually unusable. You can increase your sample rate to improve the latency, but that is far more taxing on your CPU.<p>OS X uses a system called Core Audio, and it has very respectable latency and is comparatively easy to develop for. We&#x27;re at the point where a sort of self-sustaining feedback loop is well under way. Poor latency causes musicians to prefer OS X to Windows. Audio hardware manufacturers want to release products for platforms that people are actually using, so they target OS X. Now musicians who were on the fence about switching to a Mac  have to in order to get access to decent recording equipment.<p>I have an Apogee Duet that works on OS X and iOS(!), but it doesn&#x27;t support Windows. The really weird thing is that I get better latency when recording through my iPad then I do when recording through my beefy gaming rig.<p>tl;dr: Nifty controllers won&#x27;t fix the problem. Microsoft needs to get serious about audio performance if they want musicians to use their platform.",1388336490

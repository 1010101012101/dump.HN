4666405,comment,4664892,4665123,2,0,tzs,,,"> With doxxing you have documented cases of people being harassed based on people finding out their true identity. So banning doxxing helps to prevent situations where people are harassed outside of the site for the things they do on the site.<p>And banning posting candid sexually suggestive photos of kids helps to prevent the subjects of the photos from getting harassed at school when someone finds the photos online. I don't see why that should be any less important than trying to prevent harassment of people who take and post those photos.<p>At least the person who gets harassed over posting the photos is getting harassed for something he actually deliberately did, whereas the kid might be getting harassed for accidentally showing some cleavage or some underwear. Or maybe it is ultimately the kid's fault for not dressing like a Saudi woman when in public.",1350507466

In the case of of Reaction Engines / Skylon, I have to confess a bit of skepticism -- not from a technical point of view (the credentials and capabilities of the team are superb), but from a business-plan point of view. I've done various offhand models to get it to work, and the financing costs always kill it. It only works if you presuppose A.) an existing launch market of about 250-500 Skylon-class payloads per year, and B.) that SpaceX or Blue Origin haven't succeeded in lowering launch costs with their flyback boosters etc.<p>In contrast, SpaceX has a much more bootstrap-able evolutionary path, which allows them to largely avoid financing costs, and to theoretically get their customer prices closer to their marginal costs much more quickly. My feeling has always been that Reaction Engines ought to focus more on the possibilities for aviation, since it is a large enough market that it could absorb the R&D / finance costs much more easily.

I'm guessing that there weren't actually ten times as many tickets given in 2011, so either the data is incomplete (as the author suggested), or there was a typo. If the data is incomplete, I'd suggest normalizing to the 2011 totals; otherwise, the 3-year average doesn't make much sense.<p>2. The scale of the ""normalized"" difference graphs (showing ""Actual - Expected""). The formula given is<p>(actual - expected) / total * 1000 = normalized number<p>If this is the case, then since the scale goes to about +/- 5, the differences are very small (less than 1% away from what you'd expect!). But from eyeballing the data, that doesn't seem right.<p>In any case, a better scale might be to expect the data to be normally distributed, and scale the differences to # of standard deviations.

Where is the Biblical principle that ""virtue is the mean between two vices?""<p>And if you can adequately frame radical Christian ethics this way, doesn't it suggest that the ethics themselves are not Christian but human, and aside from the particular cultural and mythopoeic trappings of radical christianity, not even really fundamentally different? If so, different from what, and to what value?<p>Let me use as an example the dilemma stated in the article, and the conclusion reached using the ""radical Christian"" metric:<p><i>This leads us to our second option: redefining which spectrum of vices and virtues we use.  Lets imagine the classic thought experiment against pacifism: Someone is attacking your grandmother; do you fight the attacker or do nothing?  By the standard metric above, only a coward would not fight.  The courageous manthe virtuous and ethical manwould clearly fight.<p>But I make decisions based on a different metric.  On the one hand, I weigh my responsibility to the victim, and on the other hand I weigh my responsibility to the perpetrator.  The virtuous person under this schema is the one who is able to treat both of them with perfect love; the vices are excessively favoring one side at the expense of the other.  That is, the virtuous man intervenes but in a nonviolent way to stop the attack.</i><p>Surely the thesis can't be that only a 'radical Christian' would be able to adopt this point of view? The final paragraph says ""radical Christians tend to adopt this perspective"" but where is the evidence that non-radical Christians of a pacifist nature tend not to?

Your slide into debt would presumably be slow (since you're young and have low overhead) and debt is cheap if you keep your credit score tight.  Timing and luck play a big part but IMHO the road from 0-$3K/mo is harder than the road from $3-10K/mo for instance.

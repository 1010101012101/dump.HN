Check out one:<p>Elon Lindenstrauss is being awarded the 2010 Fields Medal for his results on measure rigidity in ergodic theory, and their applications to number theory.<p>Fields Medal - Elon Lindenstrauss, Princeton University
Lindenstrauss has made far-reaching advances in ergodic theory, the study of measure preserving transformations. His work on a conjecture of Furstenberg and Margulis concerning the measure rigidity of higher rank diagonal actions in homogeneous spaces has led to striking applications. Specifically, jointly with Einsiedler and Katok, he established the conjecture under a further hypothesis of positive entropy. It has impressive applications to the classical Littlewood Conjecture in the theory of diophantine approximation. Developing these as well other powerful ergodic theoretic and arithmetical ideas, Lindenstrauss resolved the arithmetic quantum unique ergodicity conjecture of Rudnick and Sarnak in the theory of modular forms. He and his collaborators have found many other unexpected applications of these ergodic theoretic techniques in problems in classical number theory. His work is exceptionally deep and its impact goes far beyond ergodic theory.",1282272956

If you're using ""free"" as a ""trial"", you're doing it wrong. There are plenty of opportunities to utilize a freemium model without resorting to it being Shareware. Ours is but one example.<p>Chargify is a great example, as are others that have startup/education plans. The point is that if you want to have free as an option, you should own it and promote it and make it work for you. Having a free option as a subtitle is simply a dumb idea. If you want to charge people, charge them. Don't be half-arsed about it. Having a free plan because you're not sure people will pay is the fastest way to find the unemployment queue.<p>Most importantly, if you have a free plan, there should be a REASON for having that free plan. Having a free plan is sensible when there is a natural progression to a paid plan (e.g. Chargify), there is benefit to your business by fostering a community (e.g. UsabilityHub) or there is potential to make use of micro-transactions (e.g. Xbox Live). The point is, that there are plenty of options to be explored by all businesses, not just those that leverage the input of the community like we do.",1282272458

Apple was well on their way to having a suitable replacement for Office, and their Pro Apps suite was missing only the hole that CS fills. Neither Microsoft nor Adobe was paying Apple to keep Carbon alive, and Adobe in particular was setting new records for unimportance to Apple because Apple was too busy taking over the consumer market with their Intel machines to really care much about pro tools. (Apple would have had to worry about Microsoft not following them to new APIs if not for the facts that Office doesn't need to go 64-bit, and Microsoft needs to keep Office on the Mac in order to prevent open file formats from catching on.)

Often, I have an idea and it seems bulletproof. But when committed to paper--an archaic way to put it--its flaws reveal themselves. Sometimes the act of writing it down forces me to be specific and in doing to I recognize fatal flaws. Sometimes I need to share it and other people point out its flaws.<p>The OP is one of my poorest posts, ever. It was originally a reddit comment as part of an ""Ask Reddit."" The asker was faced with the question of whether to hire someone who had no interest in programming outside of his job, and in that context my reply was that I would be surprised if I ever even interviewed such a person.<p>Which in itself highlights the discrepancy between strategies (be they cargo cult or not) and metrics. Programming on the side is a terrible metric. It is easy to measure, but so are Lines of Code. The things we want to measure are knowledge, aptitude for learning, skill, and so forth. Programming on the side is a programmer's strategy for achieving something that we want. But it isn't what we want.<p>I was thinking the same thing about a degree. Terrible metric, but I wouldn't object if it was one of the heuristics someone uses when selecting applicants for a position. Here in Ontario job postings almost always say ""Degree or equivalent experience"" because people have successfully sued for discrimination when companies have ignored obviously qualified applicants who either didn't have a degree or had more than enough experience to compensate.<p>Getting back to your words, although the link-bait title says ""I won't hire a programmer who doesn't X,"" the article said that the real issue was that I was unlikely to interview them because of my strategy for meeting people.<p>Obviously it isn't that hard and fast. If I was looking for people and mentioned it on my blog, someone could easily get in touch with me because they read blogs on company time. Presto, I would be interviewing someone who reads blogs but doesn't do so after hours.<p>Likewise, if someone in my network said, ""You really ought to meet Joe P. NoineToFive, he's incredibly organized and does as much work in forty-five hours as you do in ninety,"" I would interview Joe and if he lived up to the claim, I would have no interest in what Joe does with the remaining 123 hours a week.<p>But the fact that I have to explain these things identifies that the post was hastily written and incoherent!<p>""All else being equal, if I have two job applicants with similar qualifications and demonstrated merit to choose from and one of these applicants programs as a hobby in addition to performing their professional duties and the other does not, I am inclined to choose the one who programs outside of work.""<p>Actually, I personally wouldn't say that, because once someone landed in an interview with me, I would have the luxury of examining each person's abilities directly. If all else really was equal, then I'm curious: Is the programmer who doesn't program as a hobby smarter? Is that why he is just as effective as the hobbyist? Or is it that programming as a hobby is a useful strategy for choosing people to interview, but once they're in the do I should ignore it?",1282270038

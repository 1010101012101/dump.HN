347305,comment,347162,347162,0,0,tdavis,,,"Amazing piece.  It makes me feel sorry for all those fish out there, stuck in tanks... and all the people in similar positions as well. I've spent my entire life trying to avoid prisons, whether it's a job I can't get out of or a really long-term commitment (military service not withstanding... although after nearly 6 years I'm really starting to feel that one)<p>While I can't speak for all programmers, I must admit that I have a very high demand for adventure -- or at least routinely changing circumstances. I don't like to be ""safe"" or ""secure"" and I don't like starting adventures that I know will end. Perhaps that's why programming appeals to me so much; no matter how much I learn or try there will always be more. There's no way for a person to ""master programming"" in general because there are just way too many adventures out there to ever finish them all.<p>Of course, the ultimate adventure that will end is life itself. Then again, I guess that one is <i>supposed</i> to end. Otherwise we'd never have a reason to start truly living in the first place.",1225273941

347303,comment,347145,347216,0,0,amix,,,"All things don't have to be practical. There's a lot of insight in knowing the theory, because it's the theory that everything is built upon. Knowing something about complexity theory gives one insight into how problems relate to each other and how complex they are - vital if you are solving problems.<p>And even if you don't use the theory, it still gives a better understanding fundament. For example, if you understand computability theory, you'll understand why your Java compiler can never determine if your program can halt or not (or any other interesting property of the program), and why you have to use static analysis to give an approximative answer.<p>And ""theory"" can be used in practice, an example is Google page rank algorithm which would have been hard to brute force without a good understanding of linear algebra.",1225273659

Just don't expect them to do too much (the CPU isn't powerful).<p>I use one as a low-power 'always on' file/ssh/git server.<p>And you can then once more have fun writing software which will run well in a restricted memory environment :-)",1225272256

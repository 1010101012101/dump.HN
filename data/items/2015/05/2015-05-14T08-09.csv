- 168 World Currencies
- Data sourced from two major Forex data vendors (uptime guarantee + high data coverage and accuracy)
- Exchange rates are refreshed every 60 min, 10 min or even within the 60-second market window
- Free Plan available (1,000 API hits, hourly updated rates)
- Historical Rates, Single-Currency Conversion, Base Currency Switching, etc.<p>That&#x27;s really just the half of it.<p>I&#x27;d be forever grateful if you took a look at https://currencylayer.com and spread the word!<p>Best,

Like most Indian students in his time, Ramanujan worked primarily on a slate. Paper was very expensive.

9544009,comment,9543889,9543889,0,0,T-R,,,"My basic strategy is that component composition gives you more leverage than memorizing individual words. Most languages have some degree of composition for vocabulary, like root-words, prefixes/suffixes, or individual chinese characters (and the radicals they&#x27;re built up from) for CJK languages. Learning those root-words/components and how to put them together into compound words, or learning how to compose words into sentences by learning grammar gives you the most leverage, once you have a small base vocabulary to practice with - it doesn&#x27;t just let you build more words, it also gives you bits and pieces you can look for to help you parse out meaning of things you don&#x27;t know. For vocabulary, focus memorization on verbs and their conjugation - nouns and adjectives tend to be easier to look up (and not conjugated as much as verbs, and so easier to identify), and tend to be easier to infer from context if you don&#x27;t know them - if you don&#x27;t know a noun in conversation, you or they can usually point to it.<p>I also listen to music in whatever language I&#x27;m learning - I used to use it to switch my brain between languages on the way from one language class to another. For memorization, the best way really is to just write it and repeat it a dozen times, so putting a song on repeat is really useful for refreshing your memory on commonly used words, practicing pronunciation, and even occasionally picking up new words by looking up lyrics, etc. Nothing beats immersion, though, just because, on top of practice (inherently prioritized by common usage), it gives you all the extra context to infer or reinforce meaning - memorizing words or working from a textbook means you have no extra information to go off of but what&#x27;s written there. If you want to get those benefits of immersion without actual immersion, find things that mimic those qualities (extra context, prioritized by common usage, repetition), like music, kids TV shows, comic books, conversation, etc.",1431592603

I&#x27;ve helped build a few companies, back when Portland was a place investors wrote off as a joke. I&#x27;ve been watching in amazement over the last few years as this has really gotten out of control.<p>The Portland metro region is a great place, and there&#x27;s a lot of potential. But frankly, it doesn&#x27;t have the economic infrastructure to justify $600k 1200sqft houses in the neighborhoods, triple-increased in price within the span of 5 years with appraisal rights waived. It&#x27;s definitely gone up in value, but that&#x27;s a ridiculous increase that&#x27;s really hard to justify when contrasted with the fundamentals.<p>You can try to blame some specific group, but really I see this ultimately as an unintended consequence of QE, ultra-low interest rates, and the subsequent global currency war it appears to have triggered. When there&#x27;s a pile of cash floating around and nothing returning interest to put it into, it moves into other devices.

The idea is to have an abstract type thm of theorems, whose operations (like modus ponens) only allow you to construct provable theorems. To prove a theorem interactively, you would start the ML toplevel and try to construct a proof of your proposition by programming in ML. The ML type system guarantees that you can only prove valid things. The toplevel is essential if you want to prove things interactively.<p>Modern theorem provers like Coq work differently. If Coq were written in SML rather than OCaml, then MLton should be good for Coq as well.

And then the same thing happens with the reverse, you have to &#x27;switch-out&#x27; the native-language, and &#x27;switch-in&#x27; the foreign-language.
Consequently, by continuing to use the native-language, you never get out of the habit of thinking in your native-language.<p>On the other hand, when never having to &#x27;switch-in&#x27; the native-language during immersion, the brain gets much more acclimated to the foreign-language and after a few days to a week, some thinking in the foreign-language occurs. The down-side to this is that you feel a bit like you&#x27;re living in a bubble, because you don&#x27;t get to speak freely (easily) to anyone else while you&#x27;re in immersion, and it just feels so relieving when you finally get to speak to someone else in your native-language.<p>Good Luck.

If we bring back any of these, we need to insure a way to offer them resistance to new disease, and offer them symbiotic micro-fauna that their bodies can handle, so they do not just die of internal disease and get eaten alive by what would normally be a good bacteria to say a modern mammal.",1431590700

(In general, OpenSSH is great but the SSH protocol itself isn&#x27;t all that special.)<p>Something like TextSecure improves on the security of SSH/SSL for its specific use case: end-to-end security, message-level forward-security even if the receiver is offline at the moment, deniable messages (instead of allowing the receiver to prove you sent them), etc.<p>Many other applications use SSL as a transport and try to add some X-factor (integration with Facebook/GMail/$GAME/...); these applications would still get made if the underlying transport changed to SSH.",1431590630

For the record, I feel the same way about Heroku, so take my opinion for what its worth... I don&#x27;t intend to hide my bias.<p>I believe people should understand and take responsibility for their systems (when possible) instead of just defaulting to relying on proprietary, closed services and software.<p>Will Pusher still be supported in 5 years? Will it still be affordable? Will it remain stable? Will the number of connections I&#x27;m allowed on my current plan stay the same? These are questions I don&#x27;t have to ask.<p>I admit my assertion that Pusher is &quot;...nothing more than a cash grab...&quot; is a little hyperbolic, and I mean no disrespect to the people who created and maintain it, but in some way it is true. Pusher is a business that relies on its users not having the time or know how to implement the service it provides on their own.<p>Max 20 connections... Want 21? pay $20/month...<p>I can copy and paste the example chat from socket.io and push it to a VPS and instantly do way better for much less.",1431590500

We wanted to use a serialization format that is close to JSON so that it would work well with JavaScript and various other languages.<p>We wanted it to be compressed, not as GZIP or Snappy, but more like Protobuf or Avro.

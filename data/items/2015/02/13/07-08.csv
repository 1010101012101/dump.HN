It&#x27;s more the latently threatening implications of requesting that someone come see you, one-on-one, behind closed doors on your own turf.<p>Think of it like the iconic scene in the film <i>Network</i> (as referenced earlier this week in the <i>Better Call Saul</i> premiere) where Ned Beatty&#x27;s seemingly-harmless Arthur Jensen invites Peter Finch&#x27;s anxious and ambitious Howard Beale to talk in his corporate conference room. Once the doors close and Beale is without recourse or defense, Jensen blows up into an apocalyptic rage, contextualized by his tone and environment to inescapably inculcate his forced parishioner that he is no less than, as Beale meakly whimpers at the end of the tirade, &quot;the face of God&quot;.<p>Clip for those who haven&#x27;t seen it: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuBe93FMiJc#t=20s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuBe93FMiJc#t=20s</a>",1423814389

9043349,comment,9043250,9043250,0,0,birken,,,"This is a good article, and I strongly agree with the general premise (which is: when given an offer at a company involving stock options, get the percentage, not just the raw number of shares).<p>However, most startup exits aren&#x27;t going to occur via IPO, they are going to occur via acquisition.  This is where the &quot;percentage&quot; value can be somewhat inaccurate, because the terms and amounts of the previous funding rounds will have a massive influence on how much the common stock is going to be worth.  Not to mention retention bonuses.<p>And another massive factor that nobody ever talks about is the founder(s) attitudes about cashing out.  Do the founder(s) want to IPO?  Are they capable of running a company for that long?  So few companies IPO.  Would the founder(s) be happy with a 20MM exit? 50MM exit? This is going to have a massive effect on the value of your equity.<p>The whole thing is just really hard.  Stock options, even with complete information, are impossible to value.  Certainly get as much information as you can (including the recommendation of this post), but basically whatever decision you make in regards to equity is going to be arbitrary anyways.  Negotiating based on salary is probably a far more productive use of your time.",1423814137
9043348,comment,9042607,9042607,0,0,jamesli,,,"Analytics is useful and important. It is utterly baloney, though, to use still pretty simplistic analytics at current stage to gauge a player for a team sport that requires players to move and have direct body contacts constantly, like basketball and soccer.<p>For example, defense. There are better analytics than several years ago when rebounds, blocks, and steals were the primary statistics. But basketball is a team sport. The contribution of a player in team defense includes how much space a player can cover, how much a player&#x27;s presence can direct the offense&#x27;s ball movement, how uncomfortable a player can make his opponent feel, both physically and psychologically, how good a player is at directing his/her teammates in a defense scheme, how good a player is at anticipating a potential issue and cover it, how much a player can make his/her teammates trust his/her defense so that the teammates can aggressively pressure the opponents, and so on. One has to really understand the game to evaluate a player&#x27;s defense correctly and fully.<p>It is the same with offense. A simple example is that Duncan requires more help defense than Barkley. That creates more space for his teammates, thus more opportunities on higher percentage shots, which will translate to more wins. It also help gets teammates more involved, make teammates better, etc.<p>I really like Barkley, both as a player and as a person. But it is nonsense to compare him to Duncan in regard to the best PF in NBA history.",1423814132

Nobody owning or admiring a cult stock ever wants to be told it&#x27;s a cult stock.<p>May I remind you that Musk has a long way to go before his legacy matches that of St. Steven of Apple.<p>Last September Musk said &quot;I think our stock price is kind of high right now, to be totally honest&quot;. The stock eventually fell from $279 to $203 today.<p>So now Musk says he thinks his current market cap is only 4% of what it could be in a decade. Really? Quite a change from &quot;kind of high&quot;. His market cap needs to compound at about 45% a year to achieve that. That puts it into the top 1% of all stock bargains.<p>Don&#x27;t downvote me. That&#x27;s too easy. Instead, go buy the stock. Buy $35,000 of it. If Musk is right, your stock will be worth $1,000,000 in ten years.

9043315,comment,9042195,9042195,0,0,vacri,,,"<i>A monkey will scream to warn its neighbors when a predator is nearby. But in doing so, it draws dangerous attention to itself. Scientists going back to Darwin have struggled to explain how this kind of altruistic behavior evolved.</i><p>Seriously, this is not that hard. If the prey is relatively mobile, for most predators the gig is up if the prey is aware of them. If the prey is alerting it&#x27;s friends that a predator is around, then that particular animal has seen the predator and is usually therefore relatively safe from it. For example, if an angry dog is barrelling towards your unsuspecting friend, shouting out may draw attention towards you, but you can shout and take countermeasures at the same time. It&#x27;s not a zero-sum game, and you don&#x27;t need hundreds of iterations to make it beneficial to yourself. I mean, hell, watch a random Attenborough nature special, and you&#x27;re likely to hear him talk about the prey spotting the predator, leading to an abandonment of the hunt.<p>The strange maths continues with the &quot;Bat&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; example. In the case where both bats do the same thing, share or not share, there are disconcordant outcomes. Same population of bats, same amount of food available, yet somehow there is much more hunger if they don&#x27;t share. This would only make sense if each bat only occasionally had a meal from a source which was much larger than it could eat by itself, then had a long period without finding food... in which case, sharing the excess really isn&#x27;t a dilemma, since it&#x27;s excess. I really don&#x27;t understand the maths in that example.<p>Game theory really does seem to be a hammer desperately searching for anything that looks like it might possibly be a nail.

9043307,comment,9040023,9041937,0,0,prostoalex,,,"&quot;You have probably come across &quot;mad&quot; people in the street incessantly talking or muttering to themselves. Well, that&#x27;s not much different from what you and all other\n&quot;normal&quot; people do, except that you don&#x27;t do it out loud. The voice comments, speculates, judges, compares, complains, likes, dislikes, and so on. The voice isn&#x27;t\nnecessarily relevant to the situation you find yourself in at the time; it may be reviving the recent or distant past or rehearsing or imagining possible future situations. Here it often imagines things going wrong and negative outcomes; this is called worry. Sometimes this soundtrack is accompanied by visual images or &quot;mental movies.&quot; Even if the voice is relevant to the situation at hand, it will interpret it in terms of the past. This is because the voice belongs to your conditioned mind, which is the result of all your past history as well as of the collective cultural mind-set you inherited. So you see and judge the present through the eyes of the past and get a totally distorted view of it. It is not uncommon for the voice to be a person&#x27;s own worst enemy. Many people live with a tormentor in their head that continuously attacks and punishes them and drains them of vital energy. It is the cause of untold misery and unhappiness, as well as of disease.<p>The good news is that you can free yourself from your mind. This is the only true liberation. You can take the first step right now. Start listening to the voice in your head as often as you can. Pay particular attention to any repetitive thought patterns, those old gramophone records that have been playing in your head perhaps for many years. This is what I mean by &quot;watching the thinker,&quot; which is another way of saying: listen to the voice in your head, be there as the witnessing presence.&quot;<p>Eckhart Tolle. &quot;The Power of Now&quot;",1423812914

It&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s freedom, indirectly. You&#x27;re free to disagree with its agenda. But recognize it as a cause.<p>Other causes seem to be respected or at least understood. No one, for instance, is surprised to see that save-the-whales advocates try to save the whales. They recognize their cause. They may disagree with their cause. They may question why it&#x27;s a worthy cause. They may think it&#x27;s a counterproductive cause. Maybe they ultimately love the taste of whale. They may disagree with semantics. That&#x27;s inevitable. It isn&#x27;t helpful, however, to exhibit (or feign) ignorance of the nature and motivations that would understand it as a cause. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s a common habit when it comes to those who argue against GPL. GPL isn&#x27;t for everyone. It&#x27;s that simple. For developers who do feel that GPL speaks to their goals, I raise a glass. When possible, I use their software and develop in kind. Why? I agree with that cause.<p>> <i>Stallman believes that linking against a DLL constitutes a derived work that would be subject to the GPL&#x27;s copyleft nature.</i><p>Basic software dependencies, with few exceptions, are subject to GPL.

Imagine this scenario:  I spend $1m writing an embedded software development chain.  This embedded system will do 90% of what everyone wants.  My business model is to charge people for writing the code to make it do the other 10% that they want.  Since everybody&#x27;s 10% is likely quite different, it makes total economic sense for me to release the code under a free license in order to drive adoption of my tool set.  There will always be more work for me to do and people willing to pay for that work.<p>But as a commercial entity I have a risk.  The risk is that if I release my tool set under a free license, somebody else will pick it up and offer services as well -- competing with me.  However, I wrote the damn thing, so I feel pretty comfortable that I can out compete other people.  Even if some people take a slice of the pie, if I can get very high adoption by distributing for free (no cost), I will still be ahead of the game.<p>What I&#x27;m really concerned about is that somebody may make a proprietary change to my software and lock customers into their version.  In this way, I&#x27;ve sunk $1m into the project and they may only invest $1k but be able to lock me out of my own market regardless of whether or not I&#x27;m a better programmer.<p>Although the GPL was not built with this in mind (I don&#x27;t think) it is a very powerful reason for commercial entities to embrace the GPL.  In fact my choice of example (embedded tool set) was not entirely random.  See: <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/tiemans.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/tiemans.htm...</a><p>As the article mentioned, the choice of free software license is really dependent upon the circumstance.  Slowly big enterprises are waking up to the idea that free licenses allows them to create consortium like development endeavours with very low barriers.  They tend to use them when trying to stake out territory and when adoption is more important the instant revenue.  One day, I believe they will realize the the GPL allows them to take a step further -- to fuel adoption that sells services.",1423812620

As far as I know, the publically-open side is a separate signal with separate bandwidth allocation. It does not use or effect your paid connection at all. Hence why one can set up a wireless router to bridge the the public network into the private one for extra free bandwidth. This also alleviates all of OP&#x27;s concerns.<p>Bottom line is that people pay for internet access as a resource, and people are generally not in the habit of giving away paid resources for free.

Data science is a jack of all trade and master of none.<p>I disagree that it&#x27;s just cs and stats, I know it might be pedantic but it also ML which involve math that is a bit more than stats. Math it&#x27;s either right or wrong. Stats you can kinda bend that in such that it&#x27;s close enough.<p>Some may say what&#x27;s the difference. This article doesn&#x27;t address the difference but from what I&#x27;ve gathered Neural Network will tell you or categorize stuff likewise with KNN, but you won&#x27;t gain insight into the WHY it is categorized that way and this is where statistic can tell you why. From lurking in the subreddit /r/statistic, Bayesian will tell you why but NN will not.<p>You still need statistic. It&#x27;s just that this is a new field and many people don&#x27;t have the depth to grasp what&#x27;s important.<p>It&#x27;s like hyping up a nosql database and promising many things and get people to adopt it.

However, I can&#x27;t help feeling it really is intended for young people recently out of school, who have no other immediate financial obligations.<p>I would really love to see an option for people who are not in this group.  Let&#x27;s imagine someone who is married, with a couple of kids and a mortgage.  Right away, YC Fellowship is not feasible.<p>If you really want another ten-fold increase in the number of startups, tapping into an older demographic could do it -- just because it seems to be a largely untapped resource. We&#x27;re talking about people with years of experience working in the real world, on real products. We&#x27;re talking about years of domain expertise, in all kinds of domains. We&#x27;re talking about people with ideas, and the expertise to execute on them. And all this potential is being left on the table because they typically can&#x27;t afford to quit their jobs for 3k a month (based on a two-founder team in YC Fellowship).<p>But if each founder had enough funding to be able to handle their financial obligations, and work full time on their startups, for a year, I think that would break open the flood gates, and you&#x27;d see a huge increase in viable startups.<p>There must be a sweet spot in terms of funding/equity for this scenario, in order to make it beneficial to everyone involved.",1437429331

9919352,comment,9916834,9918304,0,0,davismwfl,,,"Migration/comparison frameworks/tools can be used poorly just like any tool, but they don&#x27;t have to be.  When you have the funds and a moderately sized team, especially in dev, I think the migration tools/frameworks can be invaluable time savers and are superior.  Also, the OP isn&#x27;t in production, but once in Production I would expect schema changes would be less regular and generally less breaking except for occasionally. So having a tool now is more advantageous in many ways but may not fit into their budget or learning curve window, and it isn&#x27;t needed, just can be nice.<p>No tool mitigates the responsibility for reviewing the updates before applying them in production, that would just be irresponsible IMO.  But then again to me, there is no such thing as a SQL database schema change that doesn&#x27;t require a person monitoring deployment.  I know for my teams over the years many times we have tested a script in dev and stage, only to find out in production some set of records or other change that wasn&#x27;t reflected in the dev/stage environments causes an issue.  That is also why we started using migration frameworks to do diffs for us between environments to help minimize the chance we would run into these issues.  It also let us do comparisons of the scripts marked for deployment to make sure there weren&#x27;t conflicting changes, again something that occasionally happens on larger or fast moving teams.<p>It isn&#x27;t that numbered files don&#x27;t work, but just like my other suggestion, they only scale and go so far, then you really need a tool to help you keep things straight and help compare your perception to reality.  For the OP, either numbered scripts or my other suggestion works for now, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule out migration/comparison tools as they can really be helpful.<p>And actually the bank point isn&#x27;t really a good one, many of the financial clients I have worked for use SQL migration tools to manage their deployments, along with their DBA&#x27;s playing overwatch.  This allowed them to configure rules within those tools that would prevent errors from happening.",1437429060

Now I will use the words &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; with the stipulation that these words have no inherent meaning, but instead only have the meaning that we apply to them from within our own personal moral system. You can compare another moral system to your own, and decide that it is &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; but you cannot make an objective determination. Now, you can decide that your morality where adultery should be prohibited/prevented/punished is better for your purposes than mine where adultery is none of the government&#x27;s business, but that is just your personal preference. The problem is that this may never end and there is always another fellow who is more moral than you or I or both of us, and whose morality tells him that shoes are immoral or that red-haired people are witches or something like that; and this fellow wants the government to segregate the witches for the protection of the good moral folks, and also prevent everyone from wearing shoes, even firemen. So, we have to compromise on our morality and find a set of common rules upon which most of us can agree and which will protect people from serious harm even if it allows for some behavior that makes some of us uncomfortable.<p>Why do you think that two other peoples&#x27; marriage is some concern to you, or to society at large?

One has to provide a range (high, low) that guarantees one is 90% correct without being overly wide in one&#x27;s estimate. I think the goal was to get 6 questions correct. The class abysmally failed: answers way too narrow. The class really over-estimated their knowledge.

That assumes <i>far too much</i> about our current state of knowledge, and it places artificial limitations on the capacity of a super-intelligence.<p>The flaw in your thinking is your very reliance on our own knowledge as your frame of reference. You&#x27;re extrapolating from that because you can&#x27;t imagine anything else. But, that&#x27;s the point: we don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know (or what a super-intelligence might know).<p>EDIT: I could attempt to use hypothetical scenarios here to convey how your assumptions might be wrong (e.g. what if this intelligence could jump dimensions such that our laws of physics no longer hold?). However, to do that would be to commit the same error that you&#x27;re committing: it extrapolates back from our own limited language and understanding. By definition, if we can explain it, then it doesn&#x27;t meet the test of the type of intelligence that I&#x27;m referencing./EDIT<p>Your statement is also a pretty big tell that you&#x27;re working from an assumption of only marginally increased intelligence, which is where I think our disconnect really enters. To appreciate the degree of intelligence I&#x27;m referencing, see [1].<p>It&#x27;s long, but a good read in its own right. Specifically regarding this discussion, towards the middle of the page there are two graphs, labeled &quot;Our Distorted View of Intelligence&quot; and &quot;Reality&quot; which might help illustrate the scale of what I&#x27;m trying to communicate. Here also is an attendant quote:<p>><i>In our world, smart means a 130 IQ and stupid means an 85 IQ—we don’t have a word for an IQ of 12,952</i><p>See what I mean? When intelligence reaches such a scale beyond our own, it destroys key assumptions. The idea that we can comprehend that the intelligence is doing <i>something</i> is not guaranteed. Further, even if perceived, that perception itself is potentially only incrementally more representative of true understanding than not perceiving it at all. So, for any meaningful purpose, our understanding would be much more closely aligned to that of the ants WRT the 10-lane superhighway.<p>Another way to look at this is to imagine an infinitely expanding intelligence scale. At some zoom-level, we are pushed so much closer to the ants that the difference is virtually indiscernible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolu...</a>",1437426450

During those bad times, I&#x27;d lose track of my finances and a few times couldn&#x27;t pay for my groceries.<p>I can&#x27;t describe in words how much I felt like a total, utter failure. All the fears I had about how I was going to pay my bills that month, the pressure from family to pay them back for money borrowed, the pressure from roommates to come up with rent - all came bubbling up in those moments.<p>After all, I was the first kid in my family to go to college.  I was the smart one who was supposed to have his shit together, but there I was - totally broke. It creates a fear that is not rational and hasn&#x27;t gone away (at least for me).<p>About a year ago, I forgot my bank card at TJ&#x27;s and only had $20 bucks on me. I was embarrassed in ways I can&#x27;t describe. I was cold sweating to the point I was soaking my shirt.  I had to leave everything except for some essentials I needed for that night. One of the cashiers lent me $5 to help me pay for my groceries (I paid him back). I feel weird that I accepted the $5, but I wasn&#x27;t thinking rationally.  I wanted to scream &quot;no, really, I have my shit together now.&quot;  I kept telling myself that this is not a big deal... chill out...  But I just couldn&#x27;t calm myself down. It was like poverty PTSD.<p>Even though I now have paid off all my debt, school loans and have a healthy nest egg, I still have these fears.  Whenever my card won&#x27;t go through on the first try or I type in the wrong pin number, my heart jumps.<p>It&#x27;s entirely irrational.",1437426376

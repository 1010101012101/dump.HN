4821900,comment,4820898,4821147,2,0,bad_user,,,"(1) when speaking of dynamic typing versus static typing, it's not a black and white issue - it's actually full of color, but if it helps, you can think of it as an axis where languages are the dots.<p>Clojure is a dynamic language, but Ruby is more dynamic than Clojure, hence the machinery for running on the JVM is more complicated, which is why Clojure has better performance. Java is considered a static language, but because it is able of runtime introspection, runtime code generation and runtime dispatch, it is much, much more dynamic than a language like Haskell - which for the moment is the most static language out of all languages known to the mainstream.<p>The issue of dynamic versus static is also not an issue of <i>specifying types</i>. In fact it has nothing to do with that. The real difference comes from what the compiler does at <i>compile-time</i>. By definition compilers using static typing will reject pieces of code that are correct if it cannot prove that the types used support the operations you say they support. With dynamic typing on the other hand you can basically make shit up and have it executed and fail at runtime instead of compile-time ... but where the boundaries lie between compile-time and runtime differs from language to language, a language being considered either static or dynamic depending on which side the balance is inclining ... and btw, ironically languages like Java are somewhere in the middle.<p>I'm seeing programmers making a confusion between duck-typing and structural-typing or type-inferencing - like all the time, even though these concepts are fundamentally different, which shows unfamiliarity with either one or the other, but mostly with duck-typing, as duck-typing is really <i>NOT</i> about the lack of manifest-typing, which is just a side-effect.<p>(2) Play v2 is not a language. I personally don't like it, as I don't like big frameworks, being more the kind of person that prefers smaller libraries that compose well.<p>But Play v2 brings with it some really cool tools - statically type-safe templates, Iteratees for dealing with Comet/WebSockets, etc... if you evaluate Play v2 for building simple apps, like freaking blogs and such, some of the abstractions may seem over the top, but those abstractions are there to help you with other things you may need, as Play's philosophy is to be a ""scalable"" framework, while still being easy to use, just like Scala is a scalable language. The amount of pain you have to endure if you want to deal with Comet/Websockets in popular Ruby/Python frameworks is really breathtaking, while Play makes all of that easy and natural.<p>Play v2 is more immature than Play v1, but it has better foundations and is just getting started. Play v1 wasn't going anywhere the way it was and sometimes major architectural changes are needed, even though the spirit remains the same - Rails 3 is also architecturally different from Rails 2 and 1, as the needs of web developers evolve and many companies haven't migrated.<p>> <i>unless you've checked into other languages first, like Ruby, Python, Haskell, Go, Clojure</i><p>I second that argument. You should pick languages that are more suitable to personal style and more optimized for the problems you work on - however you have to be careful about it, as the metrics commonly used (e.g. beauty of syntax) are not so important as the resulting artifacts and also, language choice may be important, but is not as important as everything else (tools, libraries, ecosystem, community, etc...).<p>Also, mentioning particular languages as having priority over Scala is weird. I have problems believing that you learned all of those languages you mention. If you specified 2, maybe 3, then I'd believe you, but why give advice for preferring languages you don't know?<p>In particular, if you like Ruby and Python, you simply cannot mention Haskell in that same sentence as Haskell is everything that Ruby and Python aren't. And if you like Haskell, then placing Ruby and Python in that same sentence is some kind of abomination.",1353671654

I'd agree that the major source of accidental complexity in the law is poorly written laws, but I also think that there is significant room for improving the framework in which laws are written, such that many rules (e.g. the rule against Hearsay) that have lots of explicit exceptions would be better served a simpler framework with a few principles from which the exceptions emerge.",1353671506
4821896,comment,4821488,4821606,22,0,dvdkhlng,,,"Ever tried to build distribution packages?  If it works for you, doesn't mean it works everywhere.  Slight errors in the dependency specifications of a package may make it fail if you have wrongly versioned/missing libraries etc.  It's often very difficult to verify that package dependencies are 100% correct.  Sometimes package builds are not reproducable, as autoconf doesn't care about the build dependencies you defined but just adds any dependency it can auto-detect at compile-time.  So you have to double-test your package when build on a build server etc. etc.<p>AFAIU the Nix package manager fixes that by trying to assure bit-for-bit matching dependant packages are present by making every package version a hash of the installed files, hashed with the hash of all dependencies (similar somehow to how the filesystem/history data are managed in Git, BTW).<p>The Nix package builder (named hydra) on the other hand makes sure that builds are performed in complete isolation via enhanced chroots, so that every build is 100% reproducible.  It locks the build process down so much that it can't even access the network nor would the process be able to observe varying host names. [1]<p>This is why they call it a ""purely functional"" build system.  As in purely functional programming: there's no state at all.  Inputs completely define the output.<p>Now Guix sits on top of Nix and somehow attempts to make its features available on a higher level via a Scheme API (Nix uses its own language for package dependency and build descriptions)<p>I haven't used Nix before, just read about it, but having suffered through writing complex package build recipies for OpenWrt, I very much appreciate the approach.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hydra.nixos.org/build/2860022/download/3/release-notes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hydra.nixos.org/build/2860022/download/3/release-note...</a>",1353671506

4821892,comment,4818582,4821761,2,0,ltratt,,,"I know myself that I had a high regard for LuaJIT before benchmarking, and an even higher regard for it afterwards. Richards is an oldish benchmark, and none of the subsequent versions (Lua, Python, Converge) is exactly ""native"", so I'm not sure that any of those languages has an advantage. It's a datapoint, no more, no less. As to which VM would be faster on ""large"" programs - well, personally I agree with your implication that it's a matter of conjecture, and we'll probably never know because it's hard to write large cross-language benchmarks.<p>I do, however, think you might be a little harsh on meta-tracing. It's an interesting approach, in no small part because it allows VMs to be written for languages other than Python. LuaJIT can be retargeted too (I've been impressed by Thomas Schilling's work), but I think it would be fair to say that it's harder work than writing a new RPython interpreter. In other words, IMHO, there is plenty of scope for both LuaJIT and RPython/PyPy to co-exist happily alongside each other.",1353671459

A major purpose of the meeting is to consider updating the ITU's International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs) [2,3] to include an internet governance role for the ITU.<p>Its not very clear what the detail of the proposed changes actually is, but the Internet Society have a summary [4] that suggests a takeover of technical standardisation efforts (e.g IETF and maybe W3C processes), the regulatory functions of ICANN/IANA, and maybe oversight of the regional IP registries.<p>One point of view is that this is a power grab by the ITU, who see this as a last chance to remain relevant as the networks they used to regulate (traditional voice and data comms) are absorbed by the Internet. Behind it are various ITU member states (principally China and Russia) who hope to use an enlarged ITU as a proxy to control the Internet to further their domestic and international agendas.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union#World_Conference_on_International_Telecommunications_2012_.28WCIT-12.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.itu.int/oth/T3F01000001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itu.int/oth/T3F01000001</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://fileshare.tools.isoc.org/groups/comms/public/Publications/bp-itrbackground/bp-itrbackground-201108-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fileshare.tools.isoc.org/groups/comms/public/Publica...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.internetsociety.org/wcit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internetsociety.org/wcit</a>",1353670035

Companies expect the good developers to come out of the woodwork for a 35-40k junior dev position and wonder why they come up with dregs.<p>But I agree. In the one year I spent at a university I ran into many CS majors. Most were in it for the money.<p>Now these students were only taught in Java as far as I could tell, yet they seemed to have no interest in the language. I'd ask questions about Java web technologies that I'd only heard of (being more of PHP guy) like Struts and what not, drawing blank stares. I'd ask all sorts of things that I'd heard about the language, hoping they'd relate some experiences in regards to what I'd heard, that the code was rigid, verbose, etc. I was especially interested in what they knew about OOP which at the time I was teaching myself. More blank stares.<p>Didn't take much more digging to discover that they were pursuing the degree for the money and nothing more.

393447,comment,392889,393355,0,0,gcv,,,"I must sheepishly admit that I have not fully read Knuth. I've skimmed parts of Vol. 1-3 and looked up specific things, but I have not gone through every proof with a fine-tooth comb. (Far from it.) The book is enormously deep, very valuable if you follow all the math, insightful. At the same time, it doesn't cover a whole lot of topics, and with good reason: it isn't complete yet. Volume 4 has been in production for decades now, and being released piecemeal. CLRS (Cormen et al.) has less depth, but more breadth. The book covers introductory graph algorithms in reasonable detail, for example.<p>As a side note, Knuth presents examples using a synthetic machine language. Don't get me wrong: this is actually extremely cool, but you end up jumping between thinking about registers and then thinking about very high-level math. This shouldn't throw you off very much, but it makes me think that it shouldn't be the first or only algorithms text. CLRS, on the other hand, uses pretty dense pseudocode, lots of mutable state, and bad variable names. The longer algorithms can be hard to follow. I know that a 3rd edition will come out in a couple of years, maybe it'll fix that. Not sure.<p>Speaking for myself, I'm not sure I could plough through either Knuth or CLRS, from first to last page. I read books like that by reading introductions and then skipping around. By the time you get that far, you'll know what interests you and where you need to pick up knowledge. Certainly once you have dynamic programming techniques under your belt, you'll know enough to guide your own explorations.",1228942344

You can write the same web-app using Cake/PHP, Seam/J2EE, or RoR, and if it's a language/framework you know and like, it'll probably go about the same.<p>My big issue with language wars is everyone who jumps in pretty much brings their own experience and past projects to the table.  It's all anecdotal.  It's like asking all your friends what kind of car you should buy.<p>Even your hardcore gear-head friends will have non-rationally based biases.  Audi and BMW makes pretty similar cars in most respects, but you almost always find die-hard Audi fans or die-hard BMW fans who will happily tell you at length why brand A is the best and brand B sucks, when the reality is brands A and B are both pretty good.<p>My day job is, and has been for 10 years, working with the commercial ATG E-Commerce framework built on J2EE.  It's typically implemented by Fortune 500 type companies.  There's no equivalent personalization, B2C/B2B commerce, marketing, reporting, etc... framework with the same maturity and proven scalability available in Ruby or Perl or Python or PHP.  Does that mean Java is better than Ruby?  No, not at all.  It means for a certain type of site for a certain type of customer I'd whole heartedly recommend a Java based solution.<p>Because my day job is spent with Java, I tend to gravitate toward other Java based work in my spare time (I really like the Seam framework from JBoss).  I learn things that are applicable back and forth all the time.  For me, Java is my preferred language.  It doesn't mean it's better or worse than any other language for you or for Tim or whoever.  It also doesn't mean it's better or worse for project X, without knowing what project X is.<p>I haven't seen a language war that wasn't 99% really strong polar opinion based almost exclusively on individual anecdotal experience.",1228941057

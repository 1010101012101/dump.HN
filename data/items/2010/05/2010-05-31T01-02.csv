At least I had some good to great math teachers until my senior year (that was a <i>literal</i> life saver along with a summer school course on a UNIX V6 machine).

Our second course is roughly about OO, taught with Java (but without letting us use most of the libraries at all).<p>The design of our program is that you choose an emphasis (I'm in network security; there's also networks, graphics, AI, etc., and yes, software engineering).

And it seems like they do have separate terms for the App Store and the ""iTunes Store"".<p>However when I open iTunes to actually purchase an application, accessing the section for buying applications is very clearly done through the label ""iTunes Store"", and the status bar even shows ""Accessing iTunes Store"" as it goes to retrieve the list of applications.   The emails I receive that contain invoice information also come from the ""iTunes Store"", so it would seem to me that at least if you buy them through desktop iTunes, and not directly on the device, you are bound by the iTunes Store terms of use and cannot use them for commercial purposes.  For apps bought on the device it seems to only display ""App Store"", although I do notice emails that contain invoices still seem to come from ""iTunes Store"".  So I would say it is highly ambiguous in that case, but based on this I would definitely buy these apps ""on the device"" rather than through iTunes.",1275270626

This is where the article completely loses cohesion.<p>The way I see it, there are two ways you can teach computer science, and in both it is useful to you as a programmer, provided you apply yourself.<p>1. You are taking software engineering, learning to code. It may not broaden your horizons, but you spend four years looking at code and writing code in a structured environment, you're going to get better at coding.<p>2. It is a hopelessly abstract mathematical endeavor that has nothing to do with programming. If that's the case, it's just like philosophy of science.

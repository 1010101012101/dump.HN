They had no problems slaughtering billions of people, burning their possessions, and brainwashing their descendants. The major issue was removing all those convenient alloys from the reach of future metallurgists. They eventually settled on some nano-tech devices that melted everything into giant blobs and then sank the blobs thousands of feet into the Earth. There was a quip at the end about geology in future being doomed to failure, based as it would be on some harebrained explanation for the natural formation of convenient blobs of alloy.<p>I wonder if the story itself is as fucked-up as my memory of it is.",1406746664

Many suburbs have a relatively urban component at their core.

In fact, I&#x27;ve learned that I almost need to actively ignore short pieces of advocacy in order to keep them in perspective.<p>&quot;Modern Perl&quot; is an improvement on the coding styles that earned statements like &quot;write once, read never&quot;. However, I think it is relevant to read &quot;The Mid-Career of the Perl Programmer&quot;[1] written by chromatic, who wrote the book on Modern Perl.<p>Realistically, the audience for this article will probably be people who are starting out with programming in addition to their primary job skills. Someone else further along probably isn&#x27;t likely to choose one programming language for a career specialty.<p>While you can use Perl for automation, scripting, and data analysis as easily as you could in the past, there are additional tools available now. I feel that choosing Python, R, or Julia, depending on the task, maybe even VB.net is going to get people up and running faster, and also end up being a better starting point for doing more later if people get inspired.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7373038"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7373038</a>",1406746548

8110210,comment,8108985,8109970,3,0,saidajigumi,,,"Agreed, but reading between the lines of these ads, there&#x27;s a world of difference between an ad which is &quot;we&#x27;re looking for a great developer who will use <language X> to do [...]&quot; and &quot;we&#x27;re looking for a <language X> Developer&quot;.<p>In my experience, the latter presentation tends to actively drive away the best candidates, and communicates a lack of understanding of the job to be done.  This is not an absolute; sometimes you really do need a specific skillset.  For example, one great company I worked at almost universally hired solid developers regardless of particular checkbox skills.  We knew that the good ones would come up to speed, and we&#x27;d often benefit greatly from cross-pollination from differing backgrounds.  However, there were definite instances where we needed a true specialist, e.g. in a specific, deep platform UI framework.  Then we sought and found <i>solid developers</i> who were also top of their game in the needed skills.<p>In the latter ad copy above, a &quot;<language X> Developer&quot; often has the connotation not of a targeted specialist hire, e.g. &quot;expert in <language X>&quot;. Instead it comes across as lazy recruiting: &quot;warm body who checks off this box&quot;.",1406746311

I suppose the first question to answer is &quot;what is your background?&quot;  How are your maths (linear algebra, matrix systems, machine learning, etc)?  What part of robotics are you interested in?  Some examples include perception, mechatronics, motion control, planning, object recognition, system design, and more.<p>The answers to those questions are necessary to answer the &quot;getting in part&quot; as well as the &quot;easy transition&quot; part.<p>Software engineers at a robotics firm generally fall into two areas: motion control/industrial programmers and research-like programmers.  As you can imagine, the types of tasks motion control/industrial programmers do revolve around getting big industrial robot systems/production systems to dance to their tune, while research-like programmers are generally implementing research-level algorithms on new hardware/firmware/software systems.<p>I&#x27;ve worked for a few robotics firms in my time and will likely continue to do so.

(So if you think about it, the left hand side and the right hand side are in fact together an equation.) The &quot;:&quot; operator is often called &quot;cons&quot;, and it&#x27;s really a function which takes a head and a tail and returns a new list; hence, &quot;uncons&quot; is the reverse, breaking apart a list into an element and a new list.<p>This is useful because when processing sequences of stuff, you often want to look at the first element, do something, and the process the rest. A linked list is per definition a head and a tail, whereas other structures such as arrays and even files can be adapted into this abstraction. Even a virtual sequence such as a random generator can adopt this protocol: The head of the random generator is the next random number; the tail is the new state of the generator.<p>The article then tries to formulate this uncons operation as a Swift protocol, and talks about ways to leverage it for different types and functional constructs. Those constructs (such as fold) are the basic tools of functional programming, but will admittedly be completely unfamiliar to someone who hasn&#x27;t touched the topic before.",1406745266

If you need to cover 1875 square centimeters with something that is priced by the square meter, the conversion is going to be a multiplication or division by a power of 10. Figuring out how many square yards you need to buy to cover 1875 square inches is much more annoying.<p>There is no such argument for temperature. For both C and F, we use a decimal system to get units smaller or larger than a degree. The only advantage C has is that a difference of 1 degree C = 1 Kelvin, so converting between C and K just requires addition or subtraction of an ugly number (273.15). Converting between F and either C or K requires both a multiplication or division (by 1.8) <i>and</i> an addition or subtraction.<p>F, on the other hand, has the advantage of a smaller degree (1 degree C = 1.8 degree F), giving us a finer scale when we are sticking to integers.<p>The F scale and choice of reference points aligns it very nicely with the weather. 0 F to 100 F is pretty much the range that a world traveller will encounter as they visit various major cities. In C, that&#x27;s -18 C to 38 C.<p>The most sensible system would be to use metric for length and mass, F for temperature when you don&#x27;t need your 0 point set to absolute 0, and a Kelvin like scale where 1 K = 1 degree F instead of 1 degree C when you do need the 0 point to be absolute 0.",1406745258

It&#x27;s likely that somewhere during the course of your development you&#x27;ll need to hack together some one-off script to do something and Perl is likely the best tool for the job and will probably already be on your system. It&#x27;s worth it to learn it for no other reason than it&#x27;s probably the most productive tool for this kind of use-case available. It&#x27;ll also give you some ideas for your main development languages in how things <i>can</i> work, and the &quot;perl way&quot; of doing things will bleed into that. You&#x27;ll start to look at some of the overly complex line consuming ways of doing things like &quot;reading in a text file to a string&quot; as moronic and will start to write abstraction libraries to &quot;fix&quot; your other languages.<p>I know this is a limited view of Perl (and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Perl and using it in various key places has helped provide for a not-insignificant percent of my lifetime career earnings). But Perl 6 has effectively killed Perl.<p>It&#x27;s a case of announcing too early and getting the entire community to back off from investment of resources into new Perl code when Perl 6 feels like it&#x27;s been just around the corner for years.<p>Regardless of how you think of Perl 6 (an incremental upgrade or a major overhaul) the effect has been the same in almost every Perl shop I&#x27;m aware of. People backed off of new Perl 5 work, expecting it to stagnate (it didn&#x27;t, but perceptions are hard to overcome) and waited and waited and <i>waited</i> for the version # in their perl -v to increment to 6.<p>Since they were going to switch to new code anyway, why not try out the half-dozen other languages that have soared in popularity since? And now you end up with the situation we have now.<p>Perl 6 also provided a long standing competition target for other languages to hit. It allowed other languages to figure out what Perl 6 was and wasn&#x27;t going to bring to the table and hit the kinds of things that people really needed.<p>My ultimate opinion on 6 is that it&#x27;s a huge effort/a major rewrite, for some rather incremental changes, without addressing long standing issues with Perl for large-scale development work. There&#x27;s some <i>really</i> cool stuff in Perl 6, built in grammars are potentially amazing, but I&#x27;m not sure a 14 year wait (and counting) was worth it (and yes, I&#x27;m aware there are some implementations available, but until perl6 is a default command from the cli in any major *nix distro it doesn&#x27;t matter).",1406745079

It&#x27;s pretty good, and does most of what we need well.  It&#x27;s definitely head-and-shoulders above any other software out there that&#x27;s specific to her specialty.<p>Right now she&#x27;s considering buying another practice, and during the pre-purchase process the ~65 year old doc was talking about how fantastic their medical record/billing software suite is.  Does everything they could ever want it to do, everyone in the office loves it, etc..<p>So, I ask for a demo, and he loads up a Filemaker database running off the server in the back room.

For example, protocols and functions currently seem somewhat contradictory; getting the Unicode-compliant length of a string is a function, countElements, not a method, for example.<p>The fact that Swift is both OO and functional (with generics to boot) means there is an inherent conflict in the language that could lead to multiple styles of using it becoming popular. Witness Ruby&#x27;s stylistic transformation as it became popular and started trends that now make the old standard library seem antiquated by comparison. Or C++&#x27;s transformation through the STL. Or Python&#x27;s engagement with functional programming (which never really was able to transform it away from its OO origins).<p>By comparison, Go is simple and inexpressive, so that it&#x27;s practically impossible to break style; indeed that seems to be core to Go&#x27;s philosophy.",1406744488

It is not an intractable problem.  I <i>have</i> tried to get help, and received it with zero medication.  The key is to see a therapist (PhD - talk therapy) not a psychiatrist (MD - prescribe drugs).<p>Weekly talk therapy + mindfulness + meditation worked extremely well for me, over the course of about 9 months, in terms of dealing with anxiety and depression.  I don&#x27;t feel &quot;cured&quot; but I feel way more in control than I did before, and I am no longer afraid of depression and anxiety, I&#x27;ve literally learned to cope.<p>As someone who is very comfortable with the fact that I was in therapy at one point, I really want to encourage everyone to try it, even if you are completely happy right now.  Think of it as casually taking intro classes in learning to deal with the stress of life, and learning some basic emotional coping skills, not some way to fix yourself.<p>All that being said, there are people for whom I would guess drugs are preferable.  I had that discussion with my therapist and we agreed they weren&#x27;t for me.  I can&#x27;t speak for you, but I would highly suggest the multitude of non-drug opportunities for addressing mental health issues since it seems like the drugs aren&#x27;t necessarily helping.  Your doctor should be able to refer you to a talk therapist, but if not you should really consider switching doctors.<p>Finally, my contact information is in my profile, anyone who might have any questions about any of this or who is considering trying therapy, please feel free to contact me.",1406744134

Not true: the component that undergoes fission in all US nukes designed after 1945 is spherical, and for the component to release significant amounts of energy, the sphere has to be compressed by a very precisely-timed combination of about 20 explosions of conventional explosives (TNT or such). In fact, a new kind of electronic device needed to be invented by the Manhattan Project to meet the precise timing demands.<p>So, although it is possible for the fire to ignite the conventional explosives, it would almost certainly have not done so in precisely the way needed to activate the atomic components of the bomb -- at least that is what I have read somewhere. (Sorry, I do not remember where -- maybe Carey Sublette&#x27;s Nuclear Weapons FAQ.)<p>The worst thing that could realistically have happened is that the fire and a conventional explosion would have spread the radioactive components of the bomb (particularly, plutonium) into the environment, in the manner of a dirty bomb.",1406744061

I also hope it&#x27;s helpful, because I am in the same boat with my own screenshots. And I didn&#x27;t realize it until WWDC this year.<p>In the iTC lab, the woman helping me said that every screenshot needs to stand alone in telling the story of the app. Every screenshot has to sell. And the app icon. And the title. And the description. She wanted me to pick one or two (no more) of the best, most compelling things about my app and change everything to highlight or focus on those two things.<p>She told me that potential customers have to &quot;get it&quot; in seconds. I was to make it as easy as possible for them to understand my app as fast as possible. She even told me what she thought the two things were for my app, which I agreed with, but she only got it after talking to me for 10 minutes.<p>While I agree the Unread screenshots are bad, I&#x27;m pretty sure that neither the gradient nor floating text is the problem. It&#x27;s that the screenshots themselves are not focused on the one or two things that make <i>this</i> RSS reader worth buying.<p>There are actually 7 points made, in addition to the testimonial. But no one buys an RSS reader because of fonts, comfort, gestures, themes, sharing, OvershareKit, a testimonial, or even full-screen reading. They buy because they can read articles from their favorite websites. Why should I buy Unread? Not a single screenshot answers that question.<p>Again, I know I&#x27;m tearing into someone else&#x27;s hard work here. But my own app&#x27;s screenshots deserve the same criticism. Now that I know better, I hope others can learn from my mistakes.<p>Marketing an app well is just as hard as building one. I know how to do one and am still learning how to do the other.",1406743592

Actually, I think going the traditional book-deal route is normally a better bet than self-publishing, unless you expect the vast majority of your sales will be digital and you have a large pre-order list that gives you an assurance of a larger paycheck than any advance you&#x27;re offered.<p>Of course, authors must always be their book&#x27;s best marketer, but having a publicist takes a load off your plate.  In my case, the publisher&#x27;s in-house publicist handled pitching media outlets so I didn&#x27;t have to.<p>If you&#x27;re going to spend money to publicize your book, spend it on pitching media outlets.

8109912,comment,8109485,8109485,28,0,enduser,,,"If it helps to add clarity to what this is about, Xen still requires a host (dom0) operating system, usually Linux but also NetBSD and OpenSolaris. Mirage OS (the basis for building your own unikernel) allows building applications as domU kernels. This is advantageous because it minimizes context-switching and allows all of the code in a Xen VM (domU) to be written in a safer language than C.<p>So the dom0 OS (Linux) still determines which devices are exposed to the Unikernel. The Unikernel implementation is simple relative to a full &quot;bare metal&quot; OS because it only needs to support the Xen interfaces to block devices, the network, etc., and does not have to deal with disk drives, ethernet controllers, etc.<p>If you are running your own hardware, you&#x27;re probably better off using something like FreeBSD + Jails or Linux + LXC (Docker). The Unikernel approach is more appropriate for situations where you want to deploy applications on Xen-based cloud infrastructure (Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud Servers) and do not want to waste resources or increase security risk by running a full OS. The physical servers at Amazon and Rackspace are already running a full dom0 OS (probably Linux), so running <i>another</i> full OS on top of that just to run your app is inefficient.",1406743406

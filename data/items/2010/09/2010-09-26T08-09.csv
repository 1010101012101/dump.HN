1728863,comment,1728367,1728367,0,0,sunjain,,,"WOW! As per this guys logic, US should be focused on reducing the deficit right now rather than growth and jobs. With one of the deepest recession we ever faced hardly over and unemployment still so high, not sure how more jobs could have been created without help from govt stimulus(since consumer spending is down and so is pvt sector profits as well as hiring). With the kind of hole we were in and still are in, the biggest worry should be jobs and growth which are not going to come back just simply by waiting on consumer spending to pick up by itself(consumers are not going to spend, if there are no jobs).",1285491493

Further, the auctions for the last 2 years have shown a sharp shift towards shorter term notes, which means the amount that has to be rolled over at each auction is snowballing.",1285491489

The second one ""is this representative of what the average startup goes through when designing a user experience?"" also has a ""yes"" answer, but startups typically cut quite some corners. Good startups cut the corners they can get away with, and only as far as possible.<p>You should also keep in mind that all these are methods and not goals. You do not need personas/card sort/whatever to build a product, but they can help prevent or solve a problem. Startups often wait to the 'solve a problem' phase before they invest in these methods. That is fine, as long as you a) can detect your problem early, and b) once you have identified your problem, do not waste time doing stuff that does not help solve it. For these, you have to know what methods exist and what kind of problems they are useful for. That is what you should take away from this class.",1285491338
1728857,comment,1728220,1728220,0,0,jasonkester,,,"I graduated from high school in 1989, at the very apex of 80's butt-rock heavy metal.  My school had probably 200 guys with ratted out long hair, most of whom owned a guitar and dreamed of being a rock star.<p>Of that group, probably 50 played well enough to do a creditable ""Eruption"" solo, and there were half a dozen guys who could get on stage at an assembly and keep the entire school entertained for 10 minutes.<p>Lots of those guys, when asked what they planned to do after school would look you in the eye and tell you they were going to be a rock star.  Lots of them tried, forgoing college to form bands and live the dream.  At the time, there were so many stories of starving bands rising out of the LA club scene to land million dollar contracts that it seemed like all you had to do was show up.  It was a lot like reading the tech press today about the Bay Area.<p>Anybody care to guess how many of the guys from my school actually became rock stars?<p>So here we are, 20 years later, seeing exactly the same pattern.  We hear about the Twitters of the world, getting zillions of dollars for some trivial idea, and figure we can do that too.  And just like the kid from my youth with the Judas Priest t-shirt, we ignore the overwhelming amount of evidence we see every day that there's pretty much zero chance of that happening.<p>Here's an idea for a reality check.  Do a quick search for ""Ask HN: Rate my startup"" here.  Count(*), then Count(millionaires).  That's what you're up against.<p>If I were in school, I'd stick it out just to hedge my bet.",1285491289
1728856,comment,1728484,1728778,0,0,lzw,,,"I would like to point out that the understanding of real world economics is developed enough to make very accurate predictions.<p>For instance, I knew in late 2000 or early 2001 that there would be a housing boom, a housing bubble, and a banking crisis when it burst.  I was a slacker so it wasn't until 2003-2004 that I started putting money behind this scenario and I profited on the way up and on the way down.  (I was way too conservative in retrospect.)<p>I applied economic principles (and not my own genius, I just knew who to read) with real money and profited greatly as history unfolded as predicted.<p>The school of economics that told me about this upcomming bubble and predicted it using the same theories they have used for nearly 100 years is the Austrian School, and you can learn more about them at <a href=""http://mises.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org</a>.<p>I know much of what is presented in mainstream media, the NYT and in many college courses seems complicated to the point of uselessness, and certainly we had Bernanke and Greenspan both claiming there was no housing bubble, even when it was well on its way in 2006-2007.<p>It is not that economics is so very complicated, it is that these people have a vested interest in pretending like economics is unpredictable.  Their interest is in unlimited government spending, and so they constantly talk about deflation (never a real fear) to justify an inflationary policy which is also known as ""letting the government spend whatever they wish to buy votes and gain power.""<p>Of course you doubt that an ""unfettered"" free market economy can deliver what is promised because you've never seen one, and instead all your life you've seen government interventions result in disaster, and then said disaster being blamed on ""free market principles"".  Like california, which banned the generation and sale of electricity in the state blaming ""deregulation"" for the energy crisis.  Complete with well orchestrated ENRON show trial.<p>It is not ignorance that causes these suboptimal decisions, it is poltiicians putting one over on you.<p>FWIW, the Austrian Schools predictions go back many years, including accurately predicting the great depression, the fall of communism-- not just that it would fall, but how exactly it would fall and why-- 70 years in advance, etc.<p>I believe the ability to make predictions is the mark of a science.<p>I shouldn't care that most people buy the government nonsense that economics is ""just too complicated""... because I am able to profit from the ability to make these predictions.<p>But I see so many lives destroyed by this, and needlessly, deliberately, by people who are either extremely ignorant, or dishonest, that it drives me up the wall.  (And so I post here, knowing that I risk being downvoted into oblivion, not for failing to provide a wealth of information or a relevant perspective, but for not goosestepping along with the party line.)<p>As long as you believe it is impossible, you won't hold them accountable when they cause disaster.<p>I can predict the next two bubbles... they are already well under way.  The bond market bubble is the next one to pop. I expect we'll have a crisis in some form before the end of 2012, though timing is hard to predict.    The question is, how are they going to inflate their way out of that one-- because the prime candidate for the crisis is a failed bond auction.  (The fed appears to be printing money and buying at its own treasury auctions already to keep them from failing... this is hidden, but the clues are there, and as a result, buyers are getting wary...who knows when they will be spooked.)<p>AT some point after that the next bubble- the bubble in the value of the US dollar, will burst.  We'll have hyperinflation, most likely, unless our government takes as sharp turn towards responsibility.... but how long that takes to play out is unclear.  What is clear is that we have benefited from exporting our inflation for the past 70+ years, under Bretton Woods and other agreements, and this was viable so long as we were a major exporter, and our government was solvent.  But the soverign debt crisis sweeping europe right now is hitting countries whose (real) debt to GDP ratio is similar to ours or lower--- and our debt is growing at an unprecedented clip.<p>It is not hard to make predictions, even with some understanding of the timing.<p>Economics works. The problem is what is passed off as ""economics"" in popular culture is, most of the time, simply political ideology pretending to be economics.",1285491285

Most people are going to pick the first one they watch because since they already know what the content is going to be, and already have the image of the product ""branded"" in their mind, the second video will be both boring and dissonant [1].  They won't be able to wait for it to just get to the point, and they won't be as comfortable with the different image of it.  For even better accuracy, you could try showing people only 1 video, and having them rate it from 1-10 on a just a few questions, then compare the results.<p>My personal preference was for #2, which I happened to watch first.  I liked the music, and every frame got me more and more interested in the next.  The theme of ""the world has you up against a wall... no here's the solution"" resonated very well with me, and I think it's just the right approach to take with writers.  It was entertaining, the music was catchy, and after it thoroughly explained the problem, it showed the glorious solution of test99.  The flow of it was really awesome, it was well-scripted, cute, funny, just great.  Really, I actually enjoyed it.  It explains the problem brilliantly, even if you're not familiar with the domain of publishing, and explains how test99 is a great solutions.  The attitude is generally pretty ""kick-ass"".  I think it would work well with VCs.<p>The second video I watched (video #1), I found to be boring, and extremely trite.  It seemed like a poorly done and unimpressive Apple commercial.  I just couldn't stomach it after awhile.  I quit a few seconds after seeing ""step 1 -- start an account"" and the user going really, really slow.  I understood where it was going from there:  ""Here's how you use this, step by step, you fool!  We'll go extra slow so you can follow.""  I could see the appeal of this video for people who want to be feel ""comforted"" with a product and have a slow attention span, as opposed to people who have drive and ambition and want to break ranks quickly and fairly (that is completely video #2).  Which would you classify aspiring writers as?<p>Video #1 isn't as terrible as I make it out to be.  Both videos get the product pitch across quite nicely.  But, I'd have to go with #2, all the way.  It explains the problem (possibly for too long), makes me believe the problem is really a huge problem that is unfair and that needs to be corrected, then shows your product at the climax, and gives a brief enough description of it for me to want to try immediately.<p>Either way, I <i>strongly</i> suggest doing this in a more controlled manner if you plan to make a decision from the polls.  And, great work so far.  This product seems awesome, and I'm quite excited for you.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance</a>",1285491122

If all the consumers said they wouldn't pay more than $1.50/gallon then that's not price-fixing in the same sense.<p>That's probably true with those examples, but antitrust law tends to ignore large groups of individuals ""colluding"" in their personal retail purchases. Companies that together exert significant market power get more scrutiny, though; for example, if all the gas-station owners in Texas got together and said that they wouldn't pay more than $1.50/gallon wholesale for gas from refineries, that could be a Sherman Act violation. There have been a few cases about ""group boycotts"" as well; whereas consumers can organize boycotts for political or personal or whatever reasons, groups of companies organizing boycotts of other companies will attract investigators looking into whether the purpose of the boycott is market distortion.",1285491105

Whereas smaller short term objects and goals can be grasped and put into perspective. How can you do that with something as fluid as the path your life will take? It's certain that in the random chaos your plans will never work.<p>So, what happens when you set out to become a billionaire, or a millionaire with single minded intensity? You lose your ability to adapt and invest in the seeds that grow into something truly meaningful be it people, knowledge, observations, research, projects. So in essence by having that rigid goal in mind you're setting yourself up for failure.<p>Yes, I agree that people are complex beings and you can never factor them in, but what I have observed is that almost anyone who became anything in their lives at any level had a comparable amount of resilience. Whenever you do anything at all you will fail again and again and again. It will be as if the only thing you can do right is getting things wrong, but it takes persistence to move beyond that and that persistence is a combination of the amount of resilience a person has and what drives them.<p>As far as luck goes the interesting thing about it is that you have to be the one to walk through that door. Chance in itself can only go so far someone has to see the significance and exploit it, but that again is a function of the state of that person. Hence, you have a recursion. The luckiest people tend to be the ones who go the farthest.<p>On the other hand, my comment really might be a bunch of sour grapes.

It's much better to stay dry than to take such a chance.<p>There are examples like that in virtually every episodes. E.g.

The issue is that most startups don't have a UX person that focuses exclusively on UX. For better or for worse, there aren't many resources given to UX in startups so the person (it's usually only one person) that is responsible for UX is often also responsible for UI, visual design, branding, marketing, HTML/CSS, etc.<p>So, someone in that role has to condense each field of work into their most efficient/cheap forms. Formal UX processes like wireframing, rapid prototyping, and user stories can directly result in product decisions.<p>Other tasks are meant more for gathering inspiration, forcing lateral thought, challenging assumptions: exercises that inform product-level decisions. While that's very valuable, many startups already have a fairly clear path determined by folks from the engineering or business segments. The designer is usually taking pre-determined product decisions and crafting them into something usable, attractive, cohesive, marketable, and high-conversion. No easy feat, but not quite where unfocus groups are helpful.<p>This isn't what I would necessarily describe as ideal, but it is how it often works in my experience.

The reason there's so much effort to pretend like it is complicated is because it is profitable for those in government to do so, to cover up the effects of their actions.<p>The idea that the crises in 2008 was unexpected, or that the bailouts were necessary is absurd, and had been refuted decades before.  But it is part of the act government goes thru to keep people controlled. I knew there would be a housing bubble in late 2000, before it really got started. I knew this because I was told this by economists and hit made perfect sense.  And all these bubbles, being creations of government, result in the same kind of government response.  The effect of that response, having seen it so many times before, is quite predictable.  We've not seen the effect of the bailouts of 2008, and the bailout that just happened for credit unions... but I expect we'll see it by 2012.  And when it happens, they will all be on TV saying ""this could never have been predicted!""

I am looking for my keyboard.  Well, it's right beneath my fingers.  That should seem to disprove your theory of innate life quixoticness.  I'm not meaning to be facetious.  That's just how reasoning works.  It's very likely that you perceive life to be this way because you don't give credit to the times where you do get what you're looking for, and, conversely, you may attribute too much to the times where you don't get what you really, really want (despite seeking it very thoroughly).<p>In terms of why people fail, and the difference between zuckerburgs and you, there are many, many different reasons.  While you might have meant to say ""the main reason"" or ""the main difference"", it is my perspective that issues as complex as ""what makes people different from one another"" and ""why do some people succeed, and some people fail"" are pretty much unsolvable.  There are just so many factors in each person's life, and the world in general, that it seems incredibly unlikely that one or two factors are behind any given characteristics of our life and world.

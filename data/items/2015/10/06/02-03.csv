10336505,comment,10335836,10336187,0,0,splat,,,"> That means that 96% are guilty. That&#x27;s beyond a reasonable doubt and probably not far from the best accuracy you can expect from an inherently fuzzy system.<p>I disagree.  A 1 in 25 chance that someone is innocent certainly seems like a reasonable doubt to me.  Even 1 in 100 seems like a reasonable doubt.  1 in 1000 is maybe unreasonable, but 1 in 25?<p>At any rate, the formulation that the legal system prefers to use is the other way round.  Rather than how many innocent people we should put in jail, the question is how many guilty people we should allow to go free to prevent a single innocent person from going to jail.  The idea that an innocent person could possibly be convicted is totally at odds with the way the legal community sees itself.  (Which is why, incidentally, it is so difficult for the law to accept that innocent people have been wrongly convicted.)  So I disagree that the system is not at fault.  The legal system must recognize that false positives exist and it needs to handle them intelligently.<p>By the way, there&#x27;s a wonderful article by Eugene Volokh speculating on what an acceptable number of guilty men to let go free is [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm</a>",1444100204

Joel makes a very good observation that often people want to throw out old code because they think it&#x27;s a mess, but the truth is counter intuitive that the old code contains vast amounts of knowledge.<p>A company can be first, best, or cheat and in this case while Netscape was trying to be best, Microsoft was first.<p>This is the reason iterative code development is best.

Anyway, the better parts were largely eliminated to make C and UNIX efficient enough to run on a PDP-11. So, it&#x27;s a fact that good stuff was known, they stripped it out due to constraints, and they never fixed those decisions as constraints lightened. That language, toolset, and coding style were adopted by many developers that continued to do things that way.<p>Meanwhile, in parallel, other trends began running. The evidence by the 1970&#x27;s suggested that building secure systems require specs of behavior, a security policy, analysis one possesses the other, careful choice of language, pentesting, minimal TCB&#x27;s, interface protection, and so on. Starting with MULTICS security evaluation, which talked about &quot;insufficient argument validation&quot; (ex: buffer overflows), that crowd demonstrated in one project and paper after another how to build secure systems. Plus, where most bang for buck was in terms of efforts.<p>In parallel, people like Margaret Hamilton, Dijkstra, Wirth, Hansen, etc determined how to make software that was correct by construction. Hamilton did that in 60&#x27;s on Apollo. Dijkstra&#x27;s method of layering of simple components with careful interfaces made nearly flawless software. Wirth & Jurg did a whole PC, safe (but efficient) language, compiler and OS in 2 years that performed fine. Kept building on that. Hansen and Dijkstra built things like Concurrent Pascal that eliminated concurrency errors on top of Wirth-style work that reduced sequential errors. One group after another built on such approaches with better results than UNIX and C crowds in terms of functionality vs labor available vs defects found.<p>So, this stuff was well-known at repeated points in the implementation of UNIX, server software, compilers, etc. Better approaches are finally mainstreaming with likes of Go (Wirth-inspired) and Rust (Ada redoux?). Other safe languages were plenty mature before they showed up. Yet, many projects focused on security still use C. So what I&#x27;m talking about not only happened then: it&#x27;s still happening now.<p>&quot;Compare new to new and tell me: how many web, smtp, imap, dns servers in Python, C# or Rust do we run today?&quot;<p>Let me just apply your words to another problem. How much enterprise transaction processing uses C and UNIX today vs IBM and COBOL? There were some attempts to switch but very few successful ones despite all the goodness that comes with better languages, libs, and tools. I bet there&#x27;s a reason behind it. Yep, but it&#x27;s not that IBM and COBOL were best. I&#x27;d venture people not willing to put that work in, fear of breaking things, inertia, not knowing about better approaches, etc. The usual. Currently happening to C, C++, and Java stacks. :)<p>&quot;But definitely now with ones written in &quot;safe&quot; languages that should deliver (if they are so awesome) but somehow didn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>They did. Wirth made a whole series of them that delivered in many ways. Borland Delphi, Oberon, Component Pascal, and Modula-3 saw use in industry. GEMSOS used Pascal w/ coding guidelines to hit high security in the 1980&#x27;s.  Ada improved defect count in every empirical study I saw. A tasking profile for Ada and Eiffel both knocked out plenty concurrency errors. MULTICS used PL/0 to avoid issues that plagued C. Academics working on large projects like compilers and sometimes OS&#x27;s had positive experiences with the LISP&#x27;s, ML&#x27;s, and Haskell. And so on.<p>They proved their worth every time they were used. People&#x27;s gripes could&#x27;ve been fixed with less effort than what&#x27;s been put into making C code maintainable, reliable, secure, etc. Instead, they kept trying to build modern stuff on a language & OS stripped of its best features to run on a PDP-11. And stayed on that bandwagon to the end.",1444099995

Let&#x27;s call that 100 articles (current affairs, technology, finance, sports). It costs about a dollar per day. So each article is worth about a cent, for a paper newspaper delivered to your house.<p>> The same articles on the web at 1/3 of a cent each read doesn&#x27;t sound beyond the realms of realistic pricing for a sustainable distribution.<p>That demonstrates perfectly how the micropayment model is fundamentally different than the subscription model.<p>The assumption with micropayments is that you&#x27;re paying only for what you view – not for everything the website produces.<p>With a subscription, you&#x27;re paying for everything, whether or not your read it.<p>Say you 10 read articles in the paper each day. That works out to $0.10 an article, not $.01 an article, if you&#x27;re being charged just for what you read. A huge difference.  $0.10 would possibly be sustainable for micropayments, especially if you guaranteed the publisher a minimum payment each month.  1/3rd of a cent is simply out of the realm of reality – unless you&#x27;re agreeing to pay, in advance, for all of the articles they produce. In which case, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re talking about micropayments anymore.",1444099216

I&#x27;ve long been bothered by this problem, but here the author manages to completely miss it: The very things we&#x27;re trying to get out of hypervisors today are <i>identical</i>, or nearly so, to the things that we wanted to get out of operating systems. That is, what we call a &quot;hypervisor&quot; today is really just an OS.<p>The author of this paper had all of the facts necessary to come to this realization:<p>&quot;The early time-sharing systems isolated users from other users. [. . .] The time-sharing system also isolates the system and hardware components from the unprivileged user.&quot;<p>&quot;The hypervisor provides the necessary isolation and controls guest resource use. Since the hypervisor exposes only a simple hardware-like interface to the guest, it is much easier to reason about what can and should happen than it is to do so with containers.&quot;<p>Those two paragraphs are just the same things written in different ways: isolation of users from each other, hardware abstraction, and resource-sharing[1]. Those are the fundamental tasks of an operating system. If we call the operating system a &quot;hypervisor&quot;[2] and the user an &quot;application&quot;, it makes no difference.<p>Hypervisors have a place in allowing non-communicating users to run (different) <i>existing</i> kernels (and thus operating systems) on the same hardware. Great for VPS&#x27;s.\nHowever, using them for multiple potentially cooperating (but not necessarily mutually-trusting[4]) applications is missing the point. Operating systems have all of the necessary tools (hardware hooks) to properly isolate different users (&quot;applications&quot;); if they currently don&#x27;t do a proper job of it then that&#x27;s just a sign we need redesigned operating systems, not an additional layer which has real hardware costs![3]<p>The author of this paper laments that &quot;when you virtualize, it is more difficult to optimize resource usage, since applications do not know how to play along in the grand ecosystem&quot;, but this is one problem which operating systems have been solving fairly well for decades—or at least a lot of effort has been putting into solving these hard problems, and there&#x27;s no sense in splitting that effort into hypervisor solutions.<p>[1] which is really just the intersection of the other two; each provides an abstraction to the user that it is the only consumer of the hardware resources—equivalently, an abstraction to the application that its virtual machine is the only consumer of the hardware resources.<p>[2] Yes, hypervisors do some different tasks than OS, but I think that&#x27;s largely for two reasons, which are accidental as opposed to fundamental: 1) In order to make existing operating systems work without (much) modification, the hypervisor has to do hardware abstraction in a less abstract way, so to speak, than the OS can offer to processes. 2) At the CPU level, designers of the virtualization interface had both hindsight and freedom to improve the interfaces for hypervisor–OS interaction as compared to OS–application interaction.<p>[3] Examples of hardware costs are more memory usage by separate kernels and additional context switch cost between kernels.\nWith regards to doing a better job of it (and thus removing the current need for hypervisors for this task) I think moving away from POSIX/UNIX could help; the author has many points raised against operating systems that are really only valid criticism of *NIX.<p>[4] Any claim that hypervisors offer greater isolation between users/applications is either 1) a small result of the improvements in technology discussed in [2], or 2) a misunderstanding of the situation, where less (visible) work has been put into compromising hypervisors instead of OSes, but we have seen hypervisor exploits nonetheless.",1444098146

510877,comment,510697,510727,0,0,andrewl-hn,,,"Most software I use is available at least on three platforms so most of the time picking an OS is a hardware question for me. Last December I picked HP 2730p over Apple notebook. A tablet PC with track pad and point stick, great keyboard, bright screen and 12 hours of battery life (with a slice battery an wifi turned on). Having so many various input means is actually a very pleasant and engaging experience. Yes, this thing is a but expensive but I don't really care. I think of switching to Mac like most geeks around here (and in order not to feel like an idiot :) but every time I consider my next purchase there's a Windows-based options which suits my needs better.<p>Vista Business is a great OS and as a user I like it much more than XP or Linux (I used Mandriva a couple of years ago and have Ubuntu HH at work). I know that from architectural point of view Windows is inferior to Unix operating systems but as a user I'm very satisfied with it. I tried Mac (worked a couple of days with it) but didn't find it groundbreaking. I'm working mostly with Java and it's a second class citizen on Mac OS X. My browser of choice doesn't look great on it, too. My editor of choice is not TextMate either.<p>A usual day for me on Windows starts with firing up a couple of applications and after that OS disappears. On Mac or Linux I constantly feel it. That makes me feel uncomfortable and as a result after a whole day I'm more tired.<p>I also don't own a smartphone but having wifi and Skype on a mobile phone would be nice. The only Apple product I have is an iPod nano which isn't that bad per se but it comes with iTunes and QuickTime. The former is quite Ok but QuickTime always hijacks my file dependencies and is very annoying.<p>Mac OS X users today are somewhat similar to Win 98 users in a sense that most of them are ready to pay for desktop software. To my mind your target  platform choice is totally reasonable. If I developed an application for Windows I'd picked AIR and did everything in HTML/CSS/JS or played with Why's Shoes. Silverlight might be a good option, too.<p>I hope surprised you at least a little bit: I love Mac, but I'm a PC :)",1236725619

I am of the opinion that I cannot possibly state that I prefer an OS over another without having tried what else is available.<p>While I got comfortable with Ubuntu (XFCE as my windows manager), there were a few things that bugged me and I felt my productivity was slightly less than that when I was using Windows. I was determined to fix the issues I was having rather than go back to Windows, but in the end the time spent trying to get things how I wanted them was not time valuably spent. I valued my efficiency over whatever 'geek cred' I got for running Linux.<p>My experience on a Mac was not entirely pleasant, and I don't believe the hardware is worth the bloated price. However, I've discussed this on HN before so there's no point repeating myself :)<p>Part of my ""problem"", I'm sure, is that I've been using Windows for around 10 years (DOS before that).

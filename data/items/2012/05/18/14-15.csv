There was a massive focus on class projects and a complete ""meh"" in terms of work history.<p>Now, some of these people might have been excellent hires. But they could <i>not</i> demonstrate their aptitude. The people I did contact did have a differentiating factor: it was that they did something... almost anything... out of the ordinary in their life and put it on their resume.<p>People I contacted included a YC company intern, someone who liked Haskell, and someone who had gone from total programming novice to real-time operating system coder in 4 years.<p>Danger signs included gaps in employment (why does $applicant's resume stop in 2008?), inability to spell correctly, and lack of knowledge of the tech world.<p>It's not hard to apply Sturgeon's law and lift yourself out of the drek that I saw.

Our company provide a free, private healthcare (BUPA), but I've never felt the need to use it.<p>Recently, I had surgery for an ACL tear. Unfortunately, for some reason, it later went septic. The day the consultant found it was septic he rushed me into surgery that afternoon and I spent the next 6 nights on IV antibiotics, followed by a course of oral antibiotics. At no point did I have to worry about how much all this cost - and I didn't ring BUPA just because I couldn't be bothered and it was all perfectly satisfactory care.<p>When I was a kid I had extremely bad asthma. A new respirator type device had just been invented and I was one of the first in the North West to have one. These things cost thousands of pounds at the time and there's no way my parents would have been able to afford it, but they got it loaned to them completely free.

Is there some benefit from it that I'm potentially missing out on, or will I perhaps be in for a rude awakening in a few years because of my lack of it? I do recall reading somewhere that people who did drink coffee vs those who didn't had better odds against things like Alzheimer's disease, so  maybe that's one benefit..?<p>I'm completely serious in asking - I passed my 30th birthday a couple weeks ago and even for the past few years my aunt and others I know always ask how I get by without it. I have no aversion to it and would drink it if I needed a boost due to a poor night's sleep, but that would be maybe once every few months at most. This doesn't make me special at all so I'm not boasting or anything - the only reason I don't drink it(other than fear of stained teeth) is because I don't want to develop a need* for it, i.e. ""I can't start my day until I've had that first mug"". That would hardly be the worst thing in the world, but I'd just rather avoid it if I could.<p>For what it's worth I typically get 6-7 hours of sleep each night, and I exercise several times a week.<p>*I would typically use the word addiction, but that might be a little too strong given the context",1337351725

You essentially need RGB alpha channels so that you can blend each channel independently.  Because of this if you want to build a compositing tree with bitmap caching it is very hard to do blending in hardware.<p>One of the lead engineers did some experiments at the time where he put together blind test of cleartype vs. high quality sub-pixel positioned, gamma correct blended grayscale text.  I don't think anyone could really tell the difference.  These will only get closer as resolutions increase.<p>The lesson is that the big 'wow' factor when cleartype was introduced was the fact that glyphs were now positioned on subpixel boundaries (instead of pixel snapping the glyph origin) and use a gamma corrected blend.  The tri-channel blending was only a small part of the picture.<p>But -- cleartype was a unique differentiating feature and was shipped anyway.",1337351462

Therefore, there <i>does not exist a mechanistic method for enumerating over all true statements in the language of that formal system</i>.<p>By stating ""there are some true things that cannot be proved"" goes too philosophy deep, and is outside of our pay-grade. Just consider: humans don't reason based on mechanistic principles - and there's no proof as to the expressability of natural language (though we can be sure it's aggravatingly inconsistent)<p>EDIT: I just want to say that in general, if someone does not really grasp the technical notion of a formal system, consistency, expressiveness, provability, soundness, or recursive enumeration, then it is basically impossible for them to appreciate the incompleteness theorems, and they are very likely to grossly misrepresent it.",1337350964

Considering you were friends with the ex-designer, my thought would be that you could have probably spent more time thinking about what he wanted instead of just asking.

It was a pretty disheartening year, and I doubted whether I was worth anything to anybody. I finally got a job through a friend. All the cold calls, resumes and interviews were for naught, I got hired through cronyism.<p>I have a friend who got a degree in sociology, at the age of 28, by working at a hotel and paying out of pocket for a class or two per semester for a decade. She still works at that hotel, two years later, making just above minimum wage. I thought I had it bad being unemployed for a year, but I had military experience and technical skills that were at least somewhat in demand. She's was looking in the social work field, but now she's just looking for any job with benefits and growth, paycheck or industry be damned.<p>You could argue that sociology is not a degree you should get if you actually want to work. But this woman was written off as ""not college material"" by teachers and family alike, mostly because she was socially awkward in high school. She worked her ass off for a decade to put herself through school and I'm proud of her. She's shown more grit and determination than I have, certainly. And yet she's unemployable. Hell, she probably couldn't get that hotel job if she started now, because she's got a degree.<p>""My anecdotal observations are that the longer people I know waited to get their first job, the longer they've remained unemployed or stuck in dead end jobs.""<p>Who is waiting??

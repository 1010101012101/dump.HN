This can be a (potentially nested) mashup up binary, character and byte sequences. It is extremely memory efficient and is a pleasure to work with.<p>2) Chicago Boss database drivers use client libraries from the Erlang community. Erlang programmers<p>3) Yes. I believe Chicago Boss supported Unicode/UTF-8 before the rest of Erlang did.<p>4) I guess the biggest difference is that Chicago Boss uses Rails conventions, whereas other Erlang web frameworks create their own. For example, CB is the (only?) Erlang web framework to use a database abstraction layer built from models written in an easy-to-read DSL.",1373083103

(The study did not include workers in Amazons warehouses, where skills and turnover are different.) Were based in Seattle, and know a lot of people at Amazon, she said. The consensus is that you are run through a gamut there, make money, burn out and leave.<p>------------<p>I would not have thought that this was sustainable, but if this is accepted practice at Amazon, then perhaps this is sustainable. I am somewhat surprised that Amazon finds this productive. But perhaps they get enough out of that 1 year average that it offsets the costs of having to hire new people every year, and the cost of teaching them how the company works.",1373083103

Sometimes I find myself missing a lot of content because I&#x27;m subscribed to hundreds of different subreddits, but there is an easy way around this (as the next button is unreliable and tends to display older links instead of different new ones): In your reddit preferences check the boxes that hide links you upvote/downvote and just vote on everything you see, even if you don&#x27;t necessarily agree or disagree (or just hide it if you have &quot;moral&quot; problems with that).

5997877,comment,5995702,5996332,3,0,newbie12,,,"&quot;The real Reagan record on AIDS is different. AIDS funding skyrocketed in the 1980s, almost doubling each year from 1983 - when the media started blaring headlines - from $44 million to $103 million, $205 million, $508 million, $922 million, and then $1.6 billion in 1988. Reagan&#x27;s secretary of Health and Human Services in 1983, Margaret Heckler, declared AIDS her department&#x27;s &quot;number one priority.&quot; While the House of Representatives was Democrat-dominated throughout the 1980s, which Democrats would quickly explain was the source of that skyrocketing AIDS funding, Reagan clearly signed the spending bills that funded the war on AIDS.<p>It&#x27;s also wrong that Reagan didn&#x27;t utter the word &quot;AIDS&quot; until 1987. Any reporter who bothered to check facts would find that Reagan discussed AIDS funding in a 1985 press conference, just for starters. But let&#x27;s turn that around on the rest of Washington. Does that mean no reporter asked Reagan about AIDS in the 1984 presidential debates? And that every interview President Reagan granted to a national or local media outlet failed to solicit Reagan&#x27;s opinions on AIDS until 1985? Using this phony-baloney spin line - that federal policy hinges exclusively on the presidential bully pulpit - is an exercise in liberal hyperbole over hard data.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.mrc.org/bozells-column/new-myths-reagans-record"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrc.org/bozells-column/new-myths-reagans-record</a>",1373082655

5997848,comment,5997483,5997735,4,0,cdumler,,,"Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin. - John von Neumann<p>The very definition of a pseudo-random number generator is that it&#x27;s deterministic, i.e. an algorithm.  If you know in what the state of the algorithm is, you know what the next number will be.  Attempting to add some ad hoc behavior on top of crypto has two common issues:<p>First, adding of deterministic behavior to deterministic behavior does not in any way spontaneously add randomness (see quote). In fact, it can expose additional state on which an attack can be focused. For instance, perhaps when I learn that the system you are using is an interleaved set of numbers, I can use the starting set from each to guess the seed on which all PRNGs started.  Second, crypto PRNGs that are well vetted are already at the top of the game for being apparently random in output.  There shouldn&#x27;t be a need to do anything like what you&#x27;re suggesting, ever, with a valid PRNG.  What Schneier is pointing out is that good crypt doesn&#x27;t have a whiff of smell.  Dual_EC_DRBG does.  And, badly.  Just use the others, instead.<p>Importantly, learn the first rule of crypto: Unless you&#x27;re well versed in crypto, presume you will do a very bad job of trying to implement something yourself.  Understand for what the crypto library is meant to be used, understand how to use it properly, and don&#x27;t try to do something on your own.  It is hard for even the experts to do it well.  Some simple &quot;why don&#x27;t I just..&quot; is practically guaranteed to have a flaw.  Adding your own deterministic behavior is a sin.",1373081915

The academic community was concerned that field parameters could have been carefully selected such that they contained hidden properties (weak primes, etc). This is why &quot;nothing up my sleeve numbers&quot;[4] must be used in cryptography. The same issue impacts the selection of prime field parameters for use in ECDSA/ECDH (TLS, S/MIME, etc). Worth noting is that NIST P-256 and NIST P-384 elliptic curves were selected from &quot;verifiable random numbers&quot; generated in accordance with ANSI X9.62. This standard is not freely available so I am not sure which PRNG was used to generate the curve parameters and why the PRNG seed is considered a &quot;nothing up my sleeve number&quot;.<p>[1] Daniel M Gordon.

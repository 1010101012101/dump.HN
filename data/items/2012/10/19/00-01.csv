If that company can't afford health coverage, then I can't take that risk for my family.<p>It just baffles me that health coverage is so tied to where you work.  What if you could only send your kids to the schools that your employer selected, or eat at the restaurants the your company had a deal with?  It's just weird.  I don't know if government provided insurance is the solution, but employer provided just doesn't make sense as the only solution.",1350608381

So long as there are free and sub-$3 clients, $20 is anomalous.<p>What gets me most about arguments like these is that you are pulling numbers out of thin air. You assert that $.99 is too little for an app, but provide no context nor any evidence to support that. Give me a number that demonstrates the monetary value to the consumer of an hour of development. You can't.<p>Insofar as there is no absolute value of development time and, therefore, of apps the only way to gauge value is based on market precedent.

This is not a site comprised of people with impeccable taste that can rival any restaurant critic or ones's own sense for restaurant choices, based on experience, or word-of-mouth (spoken word).  This is yet another way to use the negativity of the web (XYZcompanysucks.com) as a form of blackmail.  What a joke.  The company that needs to be ""outed"" is Yelp.  If all the accounts are true, these guys are crooks.<p>Anyone who bases all their dining decisions on what people post to sites like Yelp is not going to have as rich an experience as people who mastered the ""old ways"" (i.e. personal knowledge not acquired online).  Why?  Because Yelp is _primarily_ for people who want to complain.  And _primarily_ for people who have no taste or worldly experience but who want to post things to the web (tech savvy).  There are exceptions, but c'mon, let's be real.  The web is the ultimate gripe channel.<p>Don't believe me?  Try basing all your decisions on Yelp.  You will not eat as well the the guy who has a sincere interest in restaurants and understands how to use the ""old ways"".  There's certainly potential for such knowledgeable people to come together at a site and produce something amazing: balanced, informative, _informed_ reviews.

I've spent the last few years encouraging people around me to start or run or improve their businesses, but so many of them just want to be a professional in their field; they don't want to deal with all of the other aspects of running a business.<p>So don't lower entrepreneurial risk because you think it will open more businesses, because you think that the guy with a good paying job and some savings is worried about his health insurance. If he (or she!) wants to open or run a business, he (or she!) will do that regardless. It's one of the few probably universal aspects of entrepreneurship that the people who will do well at it aren't really happy working for other people anyway, they have this itch that they can't scratch unless they strike out on their own, risks or not.<p>But <i>do</i> lower entrepreneurial risk because you recognize the value of entrepreneurs and you want to make sure that small business owners with families can still get good health care and dental care and afford a modest living.",1350607990

4671768,comment,4669922,4671208,1,0,ruswick,,,"I don't think the ""I'll pay anything"" guys make valid points. Most people do not judge the reasonability of a price on the amount of work that is put into a product. (Nor should they.)<p>When one purchases something, they ought to evaluate the value of a product solely on the utility that they gain from that product and how that compares to the utility and price of similar products. Tweetbot is working against the precedent set by other apps in this regard. It yields near-negligible utility over free alternatives and competes in an ecosystem dominated by free apps. (If anything, it yields less utility over others, because once the token threshold is met, it will in all likelihood become abandon-ware.) Thus the value of Tweetbot and of software in general goes down.<p>The work put in by the developers has no weight in determining the price. The market's tolerance, perception of value, and willingness to pay is the only factor. Even if I spend 10,000 hours making a great latte, it's unreasonable that I charge $1m for it because my competitors are selling a similar product at $4 and the increase in utility of my latte versus theirs is likely not enough to warrant the increase in cost to the consumer. Their logic is flawed and is totally incongruous with the most fundamental concepts of economics. Commerce is a quid pro quo, not a charitable donation.<p>I don't, however, believe that such a high price is a knock against TapBots. They are permitted to charge whatever they like. You really can't fault them for price-gouging: Everyone loves money. The desire to get more of it is something that is not only reasonable, but is lauded in a capitalist economy. I find it doubtful that many people think ill of TapBots for their pricing. Rather, the issue lies in the fact that their app does relatively little yet has an incredibly inflated and anomalous price that deviates from the norm. The motives are reasonable, but the price isn't.<p>As for me, I won't be buying TweetBot. It's more money than I can reasonably afford. Even if it weren't, it's price simply outpaces it's value to such an extent as to be unjustifiable.",1350607700

So a promoted tweet shows up identical to a read tweet.<p>Even worse, I doubt the developers are going to waste their time adding support for promoted tweets if they don't get a cut of the ad revenue.<p>And lastly, Twitter also needs to accurately count impressions on promoted tweets. on the web they can do this with some degree of accuracy -- on clients, it's trivial to filter by the isPromoted field, resulting in delivered tweets that aren't displayed and angry advertisers.",1350605428

The first time I saw that, I thought, ""They just killed the hero in the first 10 minutes of the movie!""   My mind raced, trying to figure out how they were going to make this work.  That was way too many g's.  He was surely very dead.  Was he not actually in the suit?  Was the story going to focus on a protege of some sort?  Was there a clone or twin or something?<p>When he walked away from the wreck, I was disappointed.  But I knew then with certainty what sort of physics engine we were using.",1350605175

And does it sound right to you to say ""It's unethical to THINK X?"" It sounds completely wrong to me, and (typically) when I bring it up to a native English speaker, they almost always think about it and agree.<p>Maybe you missed that memo, but it IS the typical usage, as I've observed it and confirmed with others. You don't have to believe me, but I've gotten a surprising number of upvotes (here and elsewhere) as a result of posting about this topic, so I think I'm not being crazy here.<p>2. This actually follows trivially from #1, in that ANY thought crime (looking at porn, coveting, thinking disrespectful thoughts of an elder, etc.) is de facto NOT about a relationship, and therefore can't be ""unethical.""<p>You may not believe #1, and if not, well, your loss. Not interested in arguing about it further. But you shouldn't be confused as to how #1 can imply #2.<p>There's additional confusion from the fact that ""Ethics"" as a topic of study is often just a synonym for ""Morality,"" (capital letters) which doesn't take into account the colloquial meanings of ""ethical"" (lowercase 'e') and ""moral"".<p>tl;dr: English actually sucks.",1350605172

I've found that eReaders are only good for novels, where there is a linear progression from start to finish.

4671672,comment,4668315,4668315,1,0,Zenst,,,"I find selecting country via flags of a global map to not only be alot quicker than a drop down list, but also more intuative.  As somebody who lives in Britian/United Kingdom, then selecting via a flag or mini world map is much easier.  Reason being from my point of view is often there is no UK/British option and your slotted in as American English in some forms of language selection.  Now if the application ror website wish's to do that behind the scene then fine, but with lists you tend not to have that mapping and on flags or a global map your none the wiser.  Also educational value and easier upon all cultures that way, some might prefer there drop down lists on the right, some on the left so this avoids that.  All in all it offers more positives as apposed to negatives over dropdown lists for country/flag selection.<p>So the option to have icons you can freely use without accidently stepping upoon somebodies IP can only be a good thing and counter any arguments about flag copyrights and images.  Amazing how even the simplest common items can be copyrighted - swiss clock being one even Apple slipped up upon.  So some free ones are always good.",1350604912

Let me quote Robert C. Martin on this.<p><pre><code>    If we lose the production code, we end up with a better designed system that stays clean because it has tests. If we lose the tests, then the production code rots and the team slows down in a never ending spiral of lost productivity.\n\n    So we can conclude that if it became a choice between the tests or the production code, we&#x27;d rather preserve the tests. And this means that the tests are a more important component of the system than the production code is. Because the tests are the specs.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/09/23/Test-first.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/09/23/Test-first.htm...</a>",1416679077

8646127,comment,8642988,8644753,0,0,solistice,,,"I think you&#x27;re overlooking that whys and whens are still knowledge leading to understanding of a concept, and they tend to come before the hows. You want to understand why you&#x27;re using the algorithm  before you begin working on how to implement the algorithm. As an extreme example, consider us teaching the Quicksort and the Bogosort as pure implementation but without explanation on usage. Granted, this is unlikely to ever happen, but it serves to illustrate that this kind of knowledge is part of the understanding of any algorithm, or even further, any concept.<p>Now the context you&#x27;re referring to regarding your &quot;implementing ols&quot; example seems to be largely assorted trivia to be honest. They don&#x27;t know the answer, they&#x27;re filling in  something, and have done so through highschool and then college because something might get mercy marks. I&#x27;d like to disagree on giving that the moniker meta-knowledge, it&#x27;s losely tied factoids at best.<p>I completely agree that deep understanding of concepts is incredibly important, but i think it&#x27;s unlikely we&#x27;ll see large scale change in that attitude. The way I see incentive structures for students, making that shift unconsciously is disincentivised, since moving from a cramming schedule to a more thourough approach puts you even further behind temporarily which hurts your grades. The fact that any kind of disaster or holdup could push you into the former style of learning is what I think causes the entire thing to tilt.<p>Whilst there are a couple more points I&#x27;d love to adress, I kinda want to question your assertion that this is a current generation thing. That is an awfully easy assertion to make, can usually be said about the asserters generation as well and all generations before that. Unless there&#x27;s more concrete data to back that part up, i think it does the present generation plenty of injustice.",1416678944

And &quot;make all the apps look the same except for some color&quot; is a misinterpretation, but it&#x27;s how a lot of the early practitioners seem to be interpreting it.<p>The idea, as I understand it, is material is a base metaphor that&#x27;s basically flat goo paper.

I suppose this goes for both the exact magnitude of power output (is that voltage or amperes?) and the exact frequency being ever-so-slightly above or below the expected 50Hz. These fluctuations can be measured (or fingerprinted) by carefully measuring the output of electrical appliances, such as the crackles and pops in audio recordings or brightness of light bulbs, and in fact many other things.<p>The other important fact in this trick is that apparently these fluctuations are all the same over the entire grid (or subsections of it, I guess, depending on network layout). They are also pretty much random. This means that if you keep a log of these fluctuations over time, you can timestamp recordings of pretty much anything with extreme accuracy, by matching up the patterns of crackles or power fluctuations in the recordings to your logs.<p>This would then allow one to detect fake call logs, video/audio cuts and splices, stuff like that.<p>It&#x27;s not a gigantic privacy risk (therefore probably not what the GP was thinking of), at least not from the applications I can think of the top of my head.

We believe that language is a phenomenon that is 60,000 to 100,000 years old, which is an evolutionary blink of an eye.<p>This is perhaps a problem with the theory of &quot;universal grammar&quot;, which says that language itself is an evolved instinct in the brain. When was the mass extinction of humans without universal grammar? Shouldn&#x27;t we be assuming that the brain processes we use for language evolved in the slow, haphazard way that everything else evolved, and asking what else we use this instinct for besides language?<p>Those questions I&#x27;m asking are in fact hugely controversial in linguistics, because UG has been an established theory of linguistics for decades, despite that when you take it too literally it makes no evolutionary sense, and weaker forms of it don&#x27;t make enough testable predictions.<p>On the other hand, I believe Murray Gell-Mann is beyond controversial in linguistics, as in no linguists who take themselves seriously take Gell-Mann seriously. There&#x27;s no evidence to tell us whether there was one &quot;Proto-Human&quot; language or many, and there certainly is no data to support Gell-Mann&#x27;s conjectures about specific properties of Proto-Human.<p>It feels a bit wrong to conclude this with &quot;argumentam ad cartoonist&quot;, but here&#x27;s SMBC lampooning Gell-Mann: <a href=""http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2556#comic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2556#comic</a>",1416677750

It works great for me as a desktop, but I&#x27;ve been tinkering with X desktop configurations for a long time, and don&#x27;t mind doing some work to have a desktop that functions precisely the way I want it to. Also, it is not my only desktop. (/usr/ports/sysutils/synergy FTW!)<p>Servers and network appliances are where FreeBSD really shines. The ports tree can be updated independent from the base OS and the base OS can be updated independent of ports. No upgrading to a new OS just to get a security fix for your web server.<p>ZFS is brilliant. ~7 years of FreeBSD/ZFS and no issues.<p>PF makes every other firewall I&#x27;ve run (including every commercial option) look silly. PF is like the Python of firewalls: optimized for readability. Add in CARP and PFsync for easy fault tolerance.<p>The project is managed by a democratically elected core group. Like a real democracy, sometimes this means change happens slowly. But the deliberate approach to change is part of what makes FreeBSD great. It&#x27;s stable, predictable, and reliable. It functions as a well-engineered, well-documented whole.<p>FreeBSD&#x27;s biggest fault is how little attention it draws to itself. It is quietly brilliant. It just works.

You are awfully hostile for someone who just wants to learn.  BSD operating systems are operating systems.  The full OS means the full OS.  Plain and simple.  The lack of distinction between the OS and third party packages is unique to linux distros, where the OS itself consists almost entirely of third party packages in the first place.  In BSD systems as in most systems, the operating system is everything included in the operating system, and third party software is third party software.<p>>it includes every possible package<p>This is one of the fundamental differences, which is why it seems to odd that you claim to be talking about the differences but you don&#x27;t even know them.<p>>I meant small in terms of packages.

There were also working Stirling engine cars that would have gotten significantly better mileage because itâ€™s more practical to approach the Carnot limit with the Stirling cycle than the Otto cycle:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Vnxapd5fs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Vnxapd5fs</a><p>The main tradeoff is that there hasnâ€™t been as much research in high compression Stirling engines so they tend to have a higher volume than internal combustion engines at the same power output.  But since Stirling engines have significantly fewer moving parts and use external combustion (meaning they can run on any fuel), I could never quite figure out why they were never mass produced.  Perhaps if they had been, we would have seen industrial sized Stirling engines with Argon as the working fluid decades ago.<p>Then again, before the web and Wikipedia it would have been hard to make these kinds of points at a Thanksgiving dinner table.",1416676085

In an MMO you just respawn.<p>Your fun is to make other people miserable.",1416675731

Mozilla has a API that allows sites to trigger an install with using a navigator.Apps.install() function but I believe browser vendors are concerned about users being bugged by sites that would missuse it. Many websites would ask to be installed even content only sites.<p>I believe Google wants to move from the curated app store model with reviews and ratings to a search results model algorithmically ranked apps. So making a web apps store or adding web apps to the play store doesn&#x27;t work with their future plans.",1416675698

The biggest problem I have is that you can&#x27;t just plug them into any computer like you would a graphics card. You need a compatible motherboard, and those tend to be in the high price range and 2011 sockets (which means expensive CPU). Most of the time, you won&#x27;t find out if a board is compatible until you plug a card in and try it out.<p>I&#x27;m curious how well the card will work, I&#x27;d love to see something like Erlang on such a thing.<p>[1] <a href=""https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/special-promotion-intel-xeon-phi-coprocessor-31s1p"" rel=""nofollow"">https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/special-promotion-...</a>",1416675631

On the flow side / sell-side, unless you have elevated into a more quant-focused role, the IT folks often end up dealing with FIX, but I suppose it also depends on which instrument...I was in equities.<p>> Finally, you mentioned I&#x27;m underpaid--what do you recommend I ask for in terms of a raise, and after how many months would it be appropriate? I&#x27;m a few months in and this is my first job ever because I did the master&#x27;s right after my bachelors.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m in Hong Kong and I don&#x27;t have a pulse on NYC salaries right now. I somehow thought you had some years of experience, so the salary you mentioned may not even be low if this is your first job?<p>If I was in your situation, I would do a survey among my friends to gauge the appropriate salary. Be careful about recruiters&#x27; opinions, though : it benefits them to make you feel dissatisfied at your present job, so they may exaggerate how much you could get if you jumped jobs. If the gap is too much, I would immediately put in a word in with my manager : &quot;Hey, I was just talking to my friends and I found out that I started off at the lowest salary among the bunch. On the average, the difference is $40k or more. Do you think you can revise my base or bonus at some point in the future?&quot;. It is politically important to put it across as a concern / request, not as an aggressive stand. If the gap in salary between you and your batchmates at other places is not that much, you can wait till the year-end / half-year review...<p>Plus, there are all the other issues of your employer&#x27;s brand-name, the kind of work you do, how nice your colleagues are to you, how nice of a person is your boss, etc;...All these have tremendous value, too, and employers are keenly aware of their brand-value as well as whether the work you are being allowed to do is coveted, and don&#x27;t hesitate to pay you less than market-rate if either factor comes into play!<p>> Knowing this, would you still recommend I stay in finance?<p>Yes, finance is so large an industry that stereotypes need not apply to you. For example, Jane Street is much more respectful of good coders / thinkers has a startup feel to it. You can aspire to join such a small firm rather than JPM, GS, or other axis-of-evil participants. :-) Or you can join a smaller buy-side shop, etc;<p>The top three things I would suggest doing are a) network; need not be aggressive; just do things you like with other people. Go to an R meetup or python meetup, for example. Meetups hosted at other firms&#x27; offices are a great way to check them out and get intel on what the industry is like outside your firm b) identify fields of interest and become good at them; could be tech, could be particular instruments of trading, etc; c) wait. Wait until the field and the players become more clear. Wait until you come across a firm or opportunity that makes you go, &quot;Wow, I&#x27;d like to work there / on that!&quot;. Then the energy will come to you naturally. Or maybe you see them all and it becomes really clear that you don&#x27;t even want to be in NY?<p>I think it&#x27;s great that you posted on HN and asked for advice. It&#x27;s great that you acknowledged that you are dissatisfied. The tricky part after seeing a problem is waiting. :-) The natural tendency is to jump to a solution, and often, we just simply pick the thing that looks most different from where we&#x27;re uncomfortable (startups instead of finance; SV instead of NY, etc;). Staying with the discomfort till your feelings crystallize more clearly is probably the most tricky yet important skill for anyone.",1416675604

I quote: &quot;Surprisingly, cross-platform UI works on the web. People are used to it. People don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s odd that GMail doesn&#x27;t look like Outlook or Mail.app. They don&#x27;t complain that the buttons on Twitter look different from the button of the other apps they use. They are able to use Google+ and Facebook although the UI looks &quot;foreign&quot; in comparison to other apps on their platform. Strangely enough, all those things that make cross-platform UI a bad idea seem to be absolutely OK on the web. Why is that? It has to do with expectation. When users open their web browser, they know that they are entering a very diverse space.&quot;",1395417577

7442956,comment,7440717,7440717,2,0,codegeek,,,"Here is my recommendation (I am learning web apps myself)<p>- Learn HTML/CSS/Javascript first if you don&#x27;t know already. Build a static HTML page before you get into the dynamic client/server stuff. This sounds simple but many people lack the basic understanding of HTML/CSS.<p>- Server: DigitalOcean ($5/mo). It is a great choice and balance between crappy shared hosts and expensive dedicated servers in terms of ease of use, cost and setup required.<p>- Language/Framework: I suggest Python and Flask (happy to see few others suggesting the same). Why python ? Just a preference. But if you do choose python, I would highly recommend Flask. It is &quot;micro&quot; enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about too much boilerplate that you don&#x27;t understand at first but powerful enough that you can create a simple web app in no time. Once you understand flask, you can try larger frameworks like Django which have all batteries included. As a learner, I don&#x27;t recommend Django right away because it does too much magic which means you won&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes. Flask makes you think about that.<p>- Database: Go with Postgresql or even mysql. Don&#x27;t think about NoSQL stuff at the beginning.

This obviously happens very frequently when said laws and regulations are set up for the protection of employees, farm animals, the environment, customers, market entrants, etc. in their respective role, versus employers in general, mass-production of animal products, exploitation of natural resources, selling of legal stimulants such as alcohol and tobacco. This third kind of company usually only hide part of their operations from law enforcement or the public, because their business model is compatible with compatible goals, but they are often seen (i) suppressing information about certain parts of their business, (ii) practicing aggressive lobbying and (iii) relying heavily on legal counsel in order to stay within the law while pursuing their business activities.\nBasic economic sense tells you that retaining lobbyists and legal counsel costs money, hence organizations that don&#x27;t need it would never spend money on either. &quot;Complex regulatory regimes&quot; usually don&#x27;t happen by themselves, but because the people making laws are driven (by private or public interests) to assume that it is necessary to influence what companies and individuals do.",1395416787

7442878,comment,7442756,7442756,6,0,danso,,,"These are well-done graphics and Reuters Graphics has an excellent stylebook...but just to be a nag...this strikes me as a good example of how custom Web navigation can be counterproductive for the reader.<p>I&#x27;m sure most people can figure out that the top three images are meant to be buttons, but I&#x27;ll admit that I didn&#x27;t  notice, at first, that when you click each subhed-button, a &quot;Next&quot; option pops up in the top right, along with page-boxes to the top left. It&#x27;s obvious once you&#x27;ve noticed them, <i>but the trick is noticing them in the first place</i>, which you might not because your eyes immediately jump down to the graphic. How many users, after seeing the initial graphic, immediately click on one of the other subhead buttons, thus seeing only a total of 3 graphics?<p>An equally problematic issue is that there&#x27;s no way to deep-link any of the items. I can&#x27;t easily discuss a specific graphic (and they&#x27;re hard to locate via rightclicking, as they&#x27;re embedded via svg tag) here, or even one of the subnav-topics, without fully describing the actual graphic...which is a real inconvenience. The use of clickable gray boxes as pagination only adds to the inconvenience, because now I have to count which box I&#x27;m on.<p>I think this would&#x27;ve been better served by having each sub-topic be a long, scrollable webpage...as it is now, you <i>already</i> have to scroll to read most of these graphics. Once you get done with one graphic, you have to scroll back to the top, click &quot;Next&quot;, and then read through...at least have a &quot;Next&quot; at the bottom.<p>The main argument for having this compact nav is to invite quicker comparison between slides...I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a great argument even in the best of cases, but here, because of the vertically-long slides, it&#x27;s not even applicable. It&#x27;d be far easier to flip back between sequential graphics by simply scrolling.<p>OK, that was a lot of nagging, but I hate to see great work obfuscated by &quot;gee-whiz&quot; navigational design that is user-unfriendly. I would discuss the graphics but like I said, it&#x27;s kind of a pain to specify and describe each particular slide without deeplinks.",1395416256

That way there is a different perception on solution and it causes frustration for everyone.<p>I have a different theory. Assuming that:<p>- High IQ individuals tend to rely less on intuition and more on analytical thinking.  <insert reference><p>- IQ measures analytical thinking rather then intuition. <insert reference><p>- Intuition often outperforms analytical thinking in many complex domains that require fast decision making (I believe the book &quot;Thinking fast and slow&quot; explores this theme). This could also be evidenced by the seeming lack of correlation between &quot;success&quot; and IQ, past a certain IQ level.<p>Then it could be possible that individuals who consistently outperform higher IQ individuals in a given domain find it frustrating working with them. The analytical person might point out flaws in their reasoning and the intuitive person might not be able to rationally defend their position although they are right.<p>Disclaimer: As someone who is (probably) high IQ and often victim of &quot;over analysis&quot;[0], I might just be projecting my own experience here.

Everyone has to prove themselves in life, but if you make it harder for one group of people to earn respect than another, then that isn&#x27;t fair at all. If you&#x27;ve had to put up with an unfair life, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad for other people to complain about unfairness.<p>Anti-discrimination laws only demand fair treatment. Nothing more. Positive discrimination only happens if organisations choose to follow such a policy. Most organisations actually don&#x27;t want horribly unqualified people, so it&#x27;s not as big a deal as you make out.<p>In political arenas having a percentage quota of women actually makes more sense, because political bodies are supposed to represent the people and 50% of people are women. This is predicated on the notion that everyone is more inclined and better able to represent their own gender&#x27;s perspective. It doesn&#x27;t seem too controversial to me, it just seems like an extension of the ideas of proportional representation. Where I&#x27;ve seen it, these quotas are on the list of candidates that political parties nominate, not on the list of elected politicians. It&#x27;s not that people can&#x27;t vote in who they like, it&#x27;s about who the party puts up for election, which is something regular people never have a say in anyway.<p>Cultural expectations are self-fulfilling prophecies. A hundred years ago, a lot of people had very low expectations about what women (or black people) were capable of. They were wrong, but it took a lot of time and effort to make that change. That is what political correctness is about. Political correctness demands superficial changes to how cultural expectation are expressed. It&#x27;s a case of &quot;fake it &#x27;til you make it&quot;. Even if people deep down feel differently, they are asked to suppress it and treat individuals fairly. That way, the next generation of children grow up with a different view of the world than their parents. With each generation we take a step closer to fairness and equality. People like you know just enough to see that political correctness is superficial, but not quite enough to understand why. So you call it out as hypocritical bullshit, even though it has real, practical, achievable aims. Children pick up on the superficial values of the world around them, and that has a deep effect on them.

It lacked most of the modern features of a web CMS, but it provided a native app and IE plugin for authoring. In terms of code control and consistency it kicked the ass of even the best JS libraries available today.<p>A native authoring app, side loaded onto employee machines, would be a much more powerful authoring solution. It would produce clean HTML code and push it into the CMS via an API call.",1395414027

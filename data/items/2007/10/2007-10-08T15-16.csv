64798,comment,64754,64791,0,0,cglee,,,"I personally think the reason a 'massive hit' needs a lot of money (and therefore VC) is for the hardware/bandwidth/infrastructure costs.  Those costs have not come down per the proportions that software costs have.  <p>However, services such as AWS should help for all apps right below the 'massive"" threshold, which is the vast majority of apps.",1191858212

You're probably right that most of their visitors will be of the one-time variety.  If it keeps going, my guess is the audience will be fairly small except for the occassional post that's particularly incisive or interesting.<p>Before people get too deep into talk about whether it's offensive, the title is a reference to a bit by Eddie Izzard, the excellent British comedian.

The differences between what you can do with investment and what you'd have to do without investment are pretty huge, and it seems like you might not win at all without the capital that your competitors enjoy.<p>Have any YC companies gotten by without investment?

64793,comment,64786,64786,0,0,axod,,,"Definitely. There are a few things to bear in mind...<p>1. Make sure your landing page is relevant to your keywords. If it is not, Google will give it a bad score, and your minimum bid will be raised, and you'll get less traffic.
So make sure keywords appear on the landing page as you would for SEO.<p>2. Make sure your ad-copy is good. You can create loads of differently worded adverts, and Google will work out which one gets the best CTR, and show that one the most. So spend a long time experimenting with different wording. It's sometimes surprising what changing a single word can sometimes make. (If your CTR is too low google will also reduce your quality score, and so increase your minimum bids).<p>If you pick popular keywords you can have traffic coming within about 30 minutes I've found.
Spend a while using the keyword tool, and adding your own variations - as many as you can think of.<p>When you start getting traffic on some keywords, expand that avenue - use the keyword tool to find other similar keywords.<p>How many keywords do you have and what sort of sector are we talking here? $5 is quite a lot unless you're doing finance/law etc",1191857831

1.- Which is the minimum time to learn a new language?<p>2.- Having learned the language, how much experience is necessary to make a system for a client?<p>3.- If you know how to use a certain language, and that language is suitable to make an app, do you recommend  to learn a new one, or to develop it with the language you already know?<p>Thanks!",1191857135
64788,comment,64575,64766,0,0,aston,,,"I'm pretty torn between you two's viewpoints. <p>On one hand, it's clear to me that whether or not there's direct financial value to building a super popular site, there's definitely societal value to products that people like. I really, really want stuff like Facebook to be worth a ton of money, because they mean something to (a lot of) people. Plus, my personal instinct is to build social websites, so if I'm gonna be a millionaire, it's going to be along the lines of something web2.0.<p>On the other hand, it absolutely <i>kills</i> me that a tech company can get a valuation of 100x of their current revenue, mostly on the hope that somebody somewhere'll figure out a way to make real money on a product (and in the meantime people will make acquisitions believing that it's an inevitability). Posts like pmarca's make me feel like people believe in Facebook because if Facebook doesn't work, nothing will, and we really will be back to boring 2003 instead of exciting 2007.",1191857057

The ads are not showing, after 4 days I still see zero impressions for all imaginable key words and their diagnostic tool does not really help, just says: ""This keyword does not trigger any of your ads"".<p>I have increased my budget to ridiculous $5CPC and gigantic monthly budget but nothing seem to work. At this point I am getting paranoid of things suddenly starting to work and getting a huge bill from google.<p>I searched for help here and there, but mostly found the same suggestions over and over, that do not work for me: ""increase your budget!"", ""pick better keywords!"" and ""wait 3 hours for servers to pick up your campaign"". <p>Anybody had similar and frustrating experience? Is it even possible to spend, let's say, less than $2K a month advertising on google ?

64784,comment,64650,64650,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Using IQ scores to measure people is extremely efficient. A 15 minute test can give you a good, rough idea of what sort of work a person is capable of. Someone who gets an 85 on an IQ test isn't going to MIT (no matter the effort), whereas a person with a 145 probably could (with effort).<p>This is mainly useful in situations optimized for efficiency--think mass inductions, as into the army or college, where individually judging people isn't possible.

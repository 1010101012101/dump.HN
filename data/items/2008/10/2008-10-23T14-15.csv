341183,comment,341108,341108,0,0,andr,,,"That's not the full picture, really.<p>1) Since a large chunk of the money on financial markets flows between funds, and this is pretty much a zero sum game, the average hedge fund performance is bound to be around 0%, other things being equal. It's your fault if you pick the wrong hedge fund, or you don't know the risks.<p>2) A lot of hedge funds do not target an absolute return, but rather a return on top of the market's return (and they pick an index or several which they consider to be ""the market""). So if the market is down 20%, but funds are down 17.6% on average, then they have actually made a 2.4% average return compared to the index they follow. As weird as this may sound, this is actually a success for them. They would usually get a cut of the 2.4% gains as their commission.<p>One of the main reasons is that absolute return funds are mostly quantitative and/or derivatives-based, and those are much harder to do than buying stocks by your gut feeling (which is what a large number of funds do, really). The other reason is that when a fund is big ($5bn+) it is very hard to move your positions around quickly (as would be required for an absolute return strategy), without shaking the market, and losing money in the process.",1224771777

This is a common misconception.<p>It would allow for issuing (signing) a rogue, second key that could then be used to silently active MITM a connection - but getting the CA&#x27;s key does not give you the VPN server&#x27;s key.<p>(Remember, a certificate is just a signature by a CA over the hash of the VPN server&#x27;s public key.  The CA never sees the private key of the VPN server, nor is the CA&#x27;s key used for anything other than signing.)",1416250711

Are there new ideas that should be shared and adopted - of course - however, the greatest advantage a home school teacher (in many cases a parent) has over mainstream teachers is the ability to work one-on-one for extended periods of time with a single pupil.

More practically we use voting as a propaganda technique to calm the voters... &quot;we don&#x27;t have an oligarchy or dictatorship, you get to choose between two carefully chosen (by us, not you) candidates, and they do have different PR firms... see?  thats real freedom so stop complaining!&quot;<p>&quot;Also, the problem with US citizens not being just given IDs is also bizarre&quot;<p>We&#x27;ve historically had problems with J Random Criminal walking up to the counter and asking for someone else&#x27;s ID and then doing very bad things with it.

Culturally we have a lot of people who work on commission and don&#x27;t really care about much other than collecting that commission check.  We could have .gov bankroll the substantial costs of identity paperwork, but 1) technically you&#x27;re not supposed to throw away your birth certificate, so the guy who &quot;lost&quot; it should have some skin in the game, so bill them $100 and 2) Obvious voter suppression.  At least poor voter suppression.  Also aside from cost its a confuseopoly type of situation.. profiting off people being confused.  Another thing we&#x27;re really into culturally.<p>&quot;demanding such paperwork is seen as discriminatory&quot;<p>By a subset of the population with a political axe to grind, yes.

They are all mutually incompatible with one another.<p>In the Van Laarhoven Style are `lens`, `lens-family`, and `lens-family-core` of which the last is the simplest. These are all mutually compatible, and compose automatically using regular function composition and the Prelude version of (.), but they&#x27;re somewhat hairy to see at first since they must expose their underlying type (for subtyping purposes) and that one is pretty unexpectedly weird.<p>I recommend using Van Laarhoven style lenses.

8619762,comment,8618743,8619625,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is my understanding from reading the web site and some of the proposal papers associated with the mission.<p>The plan was that Philae would come in at net 0,0 velocity with respect to the normal of the landing site. That involved putting it into an orbit which intercepted the landing site. This was made a bit more challenging as the top thruster on Philae failed to fire, which meant it was unable to circularize its interception orbit. And that resulted in some horizontal motion at the time of landing.<p>That said, the motion seems to have been well within the safely margin of the harpoon system from what I can read about that subsystem.<p>Since we aren&#x27;t on the comet we can only guess what happened but one speculation I&#x27;ve read that seems plausible is that the harpoons &quot;fired&quot; but did not &quot;release&quot;, which is to say they tried to move and did not. Imparting a delta-v that was vertical with respect to the surface normal of the landing spot. That delta-v, combined with the landers imperfect alignment, contributed to the sideways journey.<p>It did confirm that you really do want something like harpoons to hold you to the comet (and potentially to asteroids if you&#x27;re doing missions to them).",1416250510

Obviously your probability of a leak is extremely high if you&#x27;ve told 100 people -- but after a certain number n, practically speaking, your probability is high enough.

8619755,comment,8618243,8618243,0,0,krick,,,"> For a clean and conscice structure, you should always use nouns.<p>Well, yeah, it&#x27;s what everyone says, but not so easy to do in practice. Especially in complex apps there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that isn&#x27;t actually creating, updating or deleting an object, it is semantically an action. Say, action &quot;send email&quot; (and not some <i>random</i> email, but related or even defined by some business object you are referring to). Or in bookkeeping apps you often need something like &quot;recalculate&quot;, which you probably wouldn&#x27;t like to think of as &quot;updating&quot; because it isn&#x27;t &quot;take these values and apply to that object&quot;, but rather &quot;hey, it&#x27;s time to make some decision: please run some process (probably, with side effects) and tell us what the result is&quot;. Or it might be an action like &quot;moveToQueue<Name>&quot;. Or better yet, you explicitly are telling your system to make some interaction with third-party service which is essentially imperative (like GDS, or some external trading API or whatever that isn&#x27;t an <i>object</i> for your system, but really more like a service for which your app is just a friendly gateway). It is a little bit hard to think of good example right away, because if there is action &quot;purchaseTicket&quot; and there&#x27;s no object &quot;ticket&quot; in your system you might ask <i>WHY there&#x27;s no object ticket in your system</i>, but in all specific enough systems there always are situations like this, and mostly for some good reason. And yeah, there&#x27;s also decisions made for performance sake or simplicity of client-app (like some frontend-side &quot;action queue&quot; so that you can use reactive programming on front-end in more natural way).<p>So what do I do then? All URLs like &quot;/user/123/order[s]&quot;(PUT,GET,...), &quot;/product/321/comment[s]&quot;(PUT,GET,...) and, suddenly &quot;/sale/copyToAnotherService&quot;? Now <i>that</i> kind of inconsistency is something I <i>really</i> don&#x27;t like.<p>…And while I was writing the last one I though about: how should look url for something like &quot;getRecommendedProducts&quot; which depends on both user and product?<p>Now writing nouns/action names is a bit messy and so not-RESTful, but you <i>always</i> are able to write exactly what you mean by that request.",1416250408

About half of the people involved in this truly believe that the move from a nation-state security model to a single-actor security model creates an environment where mass-surveillance is a requirement, and then they justify all the (il)legality away based on this ends-begets-the-means view, but don&#x27;t often say it out loud. There is a second set of people though, closer to the top-tiers and involved in the high levels of the military-congressional-corporate-industrital-complex, who view the internet as a threat, not because of cyber-crime or cyber-terrorism, but because it allows a free anarchistic distribution of information, and feel it &quot;Must be brought under control.&quot;<p>Throughout history, every form of communication that has enabled the proletariat open access to information has been brought under control.

Client calls saying they need to hire someone, and the recruiter provides a candidate (often an independent consultant). If candidate is hired, recruiter marks up consultant&#x27;s rate and makes a margin. That margin is the agent/recruiter&#x27;s take - so the consultant is paying for the broker&#x27;s service regardless of whether that broker calls itself an agent or recruiter.</i><p>That may be true of this case, but I think that the agent relationship, if done properly, is long-term and involves a lot more trust than exists between a job-searcher and a recruiter.<p>If you get fired (let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s not your fault but potentially embarrassing, as most terminations are) and you have rock-solid trust in your agent, you can tell him and he&#x27;ll tell you what to do next, and he&#x27;ll know which companies you should be truthful with and which ones you should hide your past around. With a recruiter? You&#x27;re not going to tell him that you were fired, because you know that he&#x27;s paid by the employer&#x27;s side. He might not even call you back if you admit to it.<p>The difference between agents and recruiters is the amount of trust rendered to each. If you have a good agent, you can share your weaknesses and embarrassments and he&#x27;ll know how to work around them. On the other hand, you&#x27;re not going to tell a third-party headhunter about such things, because you want him to connect you with his best freight. Your agent can help you with the reputation-management work, but a recruiter is generally going to pipe everything you say back to his clients (i.e. prospective employers).",1416249896

But if such consciousness isn&#x27;t enough...<p>Mankind: Why did humans multiply beyond the first one to ponder about existence. It seems there might have been only a few thousand humans alive at some point in time about 100,000 yrs ago, so if the first human to draw speculations about an after-life on a cave wall lived before then, why didn&#x27;t humans go extinct soon after?<p>Messiah: Or was it a the existence of a single special human at some time in the past or future who must observe the universe? Or a single instant in the life of that special human? The instant the Buddha achieved enlightenment, or any number of other examples which make the weak anthropic principle be a religious issue not a scientific one. Could certain fine-tunings of the earth that don&#x27;t appear related to the evolution of intelligent life, such as the Sun and Moon having the exact same size when visible from Earth, exist to contribute to that moment of enlightenment of such a single human?<p>Mutant: Why does the distribution of the planets in the solar system appear to be fine-tuned for inter-gallactic space travel? There&#x27;s only about 10 other solar objects with gravity comparable to Earth&#x27;s and hence suitable for long-term civilization. The Moon has already been walked on, and humans can easily build large contained cities there using telepresent robots with a 1 second response time. Then Mars and Mercury with semi-intelligent robots to cater for the much longer response time, then Jupiter&#x27;s 4 large moons to provide humankind with experience of much longer travel times, then a single moon of Saturn to eliminate any initial choice of target, then the huge gap skipping Uranus&#x27;s lack of sizable moons to Neptune&#x27;s Tritan, and finally the thousands of years needed to terraform Venus. By then humankind will have trained up, apparently serendipitously, for inter-gallactic travel. Perhaps some evolved version of super-intelligent humans will experience some future version of consciousness we present day humans can&#x27;t conceive of and the Universe is actually fine-tuned for them.<p>Machine: Or perhaps humans build the consciousness the Universe is fine-tuned for.",1416249287

In my limited experience, the engineers that get agents are bad.”</i><p>That may be true now, but programming has a <i>huge</i> reputation management component. Negotiation isn&#x27;t hard to learn, but it&#x27;s always better to have an advocate than to negotiate for yourself (note: lawyers retain other lawyers) and  detecting trends in technologies and finding work that helps a programmer&#x27;s career is a full-time job in its own right.<p><i>By many measures, the star system didn’t work that well for Hollywood: it made moviemaking more expensive, which made studios more risk-averse, which led to inferior creative projects. And programmers are not movie stars—not yet, anyway. “Movie stars have their own brands,” McKinnon, the Okta C.E.O., said. “People will go to see a movie just because it has Tom Cruise in it. But programmers don’t really have that. No one’s going to pay for a product just because James Gosling built it.” (Gosling is one of the inventors of Java.) “Well, geeks like me will. But most people won’t. They pay for a service.”</i><p>In Hollywood and software both, value delivered is multiplicative rather than additive. A good actor in the lead role might add 10% to revenue. If it&#x27;s going to be a $5 million film, that&#x27;s only $500,000. If it&#x27;s going to be a $250 million film, that&#x27;s huge: now we&#x27;re talking about $25 million. Of course, many of these multiplicative variables are latent and unknown until the thing&#x27;s actually released.<p>Because of this, no one knows what &quot;the base&quot; is, or who contributed what, and there&#x27;s wide room for negotiation.",1416249140

If you disclose the company, then anyone who comes across your posting can just go to the company&#x27;s site and circumvent you. But axiomatically, you shouldn&#x27;t be relying too heavily on job sites if you&#x27;re a recruiter. The company hired you for your network, and for your ability to find (and vet) interesting people. If it wanted to post listings online, it wouldn&#x27;t need a third party to do so.",1416248958

I&#x27;m not very familiar with the Google setup, but you could use the Amazon API to pull metrics about boxes, then send a request to add another box to the auto-scaling group manually if you wanted.<p>> How do you prevent oscillations in resource allocations when the traffic is fluctuating?<p>Oscillation is kind of the point -- if you need x servers to serve y hits per hour, you&#x27;ll have x servers when you need it. But when you&#x27;re down to y/2 hits per hour, you don&#x27;t need to be paying for x servers anymore. It just depends on load -- for example, you can set the group to add a box when average CPU rises above 70 percent, and then set it to remove a box when average CPU falls below 30 percent.<p>> How do you know if e.g. an adversary is just DDoS&#x27;ing your application to make it more expensive to run your application? I guess there must be some kind of threshold that you can set? But then this would cut off the website for the real customers...<p>This isn&#x27;t a problem for auto-scaling, it&#x27;s a problem for web stacks – the whole point of the &quot;auto&quot; part of it is that increase traffic means increased resources. Going counter to that gets complicated quickly. I&#x27;m sure there are folks who know more about DDoS mitigation than I do, but  putting protection in front of your app with something like Akamai should help, as can keeping an eye out for bizarre spikes from certain IP ranges.",1416248929

Typing is most useful when the type structure won&#x27;t fit in the programmer&#x27;s head all at once, or when there are multiple programmers and changes over time.  Small scale experiments don&#x27;t catch that, and are more sensitive to how well the compiler reports errors.<p>Looking at code on Github is promising. Several people have done that, trying to analyze changes.  Of course, you only see the changes that get pushed to the server, so you&#x27;re only seeing post-test results.<p>We seem to be converging on a consensus on typing.  Within a module, automatic type inference makes life easier and programs less wordy.  The newer hard-compiled languages, Go and Rust, have that.  Even C++ has that now, with &quot;auto&quot;.  Program-wide type inference is hard and less helpful. Program-wide inference also means the caller&#x27;s types drive the callee, which is a mismatch to the concept of libraries.  So that hasn&#x27;t caught on.<p>Expressing size remains an issue. Is size part of a type?  C and C++ struggle with this and lose. Go and Rust make a distinction between arrays and slices, which seems to be working.<p>Type attributes are still up in the air.  Read-only/immutable is common.  By value or by ref is sometimes explicit and sometimes implicit.  Whether something can be nil is not common, but has been tried. Rust has the &quot;borrow&quot; concept, which is promising but doesn&#x27;t much mileage on it yet.<p>There&#x27;s been real progress in recent years.  Until recently, type systems in mainstream languages looked like either C or Pascal.  Now they&#x27;re getting better.",1416248424

Might have to wait for proper papers etc<p>It is not immediately obvious to me why who owns the instrumentation would be a driving factor in the time to see results. Both private research institutes and public institutes would want to get results out as quickly as possible, to capitalize on the PR effect. But that is moderated by the need to perform sufficienly accurate and detailed analysis, which takes time. Those pressures are the same for both public and private research institutes. If anything, the private institues would feel more pressure to publish results quickly, to improve their chances of obtaining future funding.<p>I cannot tell if you are comparing the quickness of this press release with the lack of results from the scientific packages on Phile, but I will address the (potential) comparison, just in case... Part of reason this press release (with the image of Philae bouncing) was out so quickly is that it does not require a very detailed and specific analysis (requiring roughly the equivalenth of image stictching in photoshop), and the results are fairly straightforward. Additionally, it is not really providing much in the way of new scientific information and so does not have as high a burden of proof. Additionally, the OSIRIS imager has been used to collect data for a while now, so presumably the OSIRIS team has a decent understanding of the real-world operation of the equipment, enabling them to quickly release images in which they were confident. In contrast, the Philae lander&#x27;s instruments had not provided actual data before the landing, so the instrument teams still need to do the careful calibrations and analysis to understand the systematics.",1416247705

(And it&#x27;s not for lack of strong opinions -- grab a professional photographer sometime and ask them about Canon vs. Nikon.) I think it really is fundamentally difficult to measure things like this: getting the most out of a tool can take years, and ecosystem factors can outweigh even a large difference in &#x27;inherent quality&#x27;.<p>If we care about using nice languages, it seems like the best thing we can do is try and lower the impact of these external factors. I think the situation here is actually pretty promising -- projects like LLVM take a lot of the heavy lifting out of implementing a performant compiler, and the JVM and CLR are becoming more and more hospitable to diverse language implementations. There will always be a cost to choosing an unpopular language -- but the smaller that cost is, the easier it will be for better technologies to win out in practice.",1416247526

One must establish early, often, and unequivocally that the org is not going to be party to exclusionary behavior.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say, &quot;you have to increase diversity&quot;, but that&#x27;s a goal, not a plan.

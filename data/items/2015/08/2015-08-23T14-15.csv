In the process, it sounds like he also exposed the fact that you can copy keys our of what sounds like should have been a read only smart card but that points to the VA IT department being inept not that guy doing anything wrong.

At the same time, based on this[1], it appears your burn has doubled in less than a year, and your quarterly burn appears to be significantly higher than what you projected here[2].<p>This is a quintessential demonstration of what I wrote above: it&#x27;s far easier to spend money in anticipation of growth than it is to actually grow revenues.

They were extremely lucky, the prevailing winds there are West-to-East.<p>Every time I crossed back from East Germany into West Germany after spending time in Poland I had my car pretty much taken apart at the border (the head of the &#x27;corridor&#x27;, at a place called Helmstedt, if you drive by there today you can still see the watchtowers and the old border to the right of the highway) to make sure I wasn&#x27;t hiding anybody in the strange bodywork of the car (a Citroen model DS which has a lot of weird curves and spaces).<p>Very frustrating because the border guards would be very diligent about ripping everything up but they would definitely not help putting things back together again.<p>One day I had my engine overheating on the Eastern side at the border and was greeted by rounds of tracer behind the car when I tried to back out of the cage that the car was in in search of water.<p>Another time I got arrested at &#x27;Checkpoint Charlie&#x27; by one Oberwachtmeister Krause because I wasn&#x27;t supposed to be there (on the Eastern side). He was entirely correct that I shouldn&#x27;t be there, the reason was that I&#x27;d helped a bunch of people that were stuck in their car (a Trabant, a small two stroke car with an extremely small engine that was prone to stop working for no particular reason) by the side of the road (East Germans were allowed the use of the corridor as well, but visitors and West Germans could not leave that road except with special permission) and I couldn&#x27;t find my way back to the corridor. I had followed the signs back saying &#x27;Berlin&#x27; but did not realize soon enough that this would not work. After many hours waiting and interviews and threats we were finally allowed to leave again. The Americans were quite surprised that a car with Dutch license plates approached from the East German side of the most guarded border in Europe, probably a first for them.<p>No fond memories of the officials in &#x27;The East&#x27;, I hope their children and grandchildren will remind them periodically that they were part of the problem.<p>Many of them went on to positions in the current German police force and military, not without resistance of their former West German colleagues who saw them (rightly) responsible for the many deaths on the East German side.<p>Fortunately these families made it, many did not and it is good to remember that this was only a very few short years ago. Especially worth remembering given that if the East German authorities had had access to the kind of information that current governments have access to that these families likely would <i>not</i> have made it out at all and/or would have been killed in the attempt.",1440340982

Because of the new async/await syntax it is (almost) as easy to write and get correct as non-async code.<p>Async/await makes an entire class of problems go away (and, ok, swaps it for a class of easier-to-solve problems).<p>In a web application you <i>always</i> need to consider how your application will be impacted by the traffic. Are all of your requests served within 50 milliseconds? Fine, then you do not need async. Do your handlers ever call out to an external site or even a local database where it may block for more than 50 milliseconds? Then you need to consider what happens when almost <i>all</i> of the requests block at at same time: A colossal waste of resources.<p>Traditionally we have handled this by increasing the number of threads we allow the server to use for serving requests. However, threads are expensive in overhead (memory, cpu for context switching) and it affects the footprint of your application, and with that how dense you can pack virtual servers.<p>Enter async: When a request blocks on an external call (to an external site, database etc), the request relinquishes the thread which will be used to serve <i>other</i> requests.<p>What&#x27;s more: The more you use async/await, the more the application will auto-scale.

For instance, conservatives in general think the tax code is both too complex and too onerous. In a return-free system, citizens are given a summarized bill and encouraged not to consider the line items. The concern is that the bill is unfair, and the less citizens have it shoved in their face, the less likely we are to get a fairer tax code.<p>I&#x27;m a conservative, and I do believe the tax code is complex and onerous.  Its made that way by lobbyists trying to get their special deals, and politicians using a revenue generation mechanism to push behavior.<p>The thought that its is only Intuit&#x27;s 2.3MM/yr keeping the tax code complex is a bit bogus.  There are many industries that rely on the current tax code&#x27;s deductions and complexities to survive.  The amount of money by companies, unions, and NGOs is staggering.  They are backed by the helpful idiots in the media that continually preach that any tax code change is an assault on the poor.  Even showing no understanding of basic math when deduction + flat rate taxes are suggested.<p>And yes, since I barely trust government accounting, having been the victim of a $1,000+ mistake which took a long time to resolve and hurt quite a bit and growing up under Indian Health Service, I don&#x27;t believe in a return-free system.  The thought anyone would take &quot;trust us&quot; from the IRS (or any government agency) is so foreign to my thinking, I just don&#x27;t understand how it would work.<p>I believe in a flat rate tax with a larger base deductible with no social, moral, or lobbyist driven deductions.

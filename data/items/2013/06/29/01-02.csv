That can be mitigated by having a &#x27;challenge&#x27; question (e.g., &quot;What is your favorite...&quot;) on the SSO managers such as facebook.<p>But I think the better solution is that we seriously need to push browsers to encourage public/private key auth. That we don&#x27;t have public/private keys standardized and easy to use is a shame. You could just have a little button on the browser that asks for a global password. When entered, it then populates your user-agent with your public key, and a localhost cookie with your private key. Then this entire mess maybe goes away (but I&#x27;m no security researcher).

Predicting events which are already scripted agendas playing out isn&#x27;t very difficult, because you can usually assume the script will play out, unless some significant (unlikely) event stops them from doing so.<p>I&#x27;d complain about your use of the term &quot;Syria civil war.&quot; We should really be straight on the issue, that is has never been a civil war since day one - outside powers have, and continue to influence the state of the country, where a bunch of &quot;terrorists&quot; would&#x27;ve otherwise been taken care of long ago by the Syrian army.<p>The &quot;Syria war&quot; (correct term), is not going to be won by some low level rebels, but by the US and it&#x27;s allies by imposing a no-fly-zone, conducting air strikes, and continuing to arm Syrian (and non-Syrian) Rebels to topple Assad. This is how wars are conducted now - the main instigators can absolve themselves of accountability and responsibility by using a group of rebels as their proxy.<p>And you don&#x27;t exactly need to be a professor of history to know what happens to countries after the US conducts it&#x27;s invasions. As Einstein pointed out: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is insanity. If we ask what the US and allies are doing differently this time, we see that it&#x27;s business as usual, so they must be insane, right?<p>Or, we can assume that they know damn well what will happen after Assad is toppled, but they&#x27;ll go ahead with the plan anyway. The result will depend on Russia&#x27;s involvement though: will they just let the US invade Syria, or will the US still go ahead with invasion despite Russia&#x27;s opposition - in this case, we&#x27;re likely heading into WW3. And we should rightly ask: Is that the plan all along? (As you say, a UN breakup or centralization of power will be the inevitable result: I&#x27;m betting on the latter, since that&#x27;s the agenda of those paying for the wars.)<p>Being called a tin-hat wearer becomes a compliment after a while - you&#x27;re no longer gullible to the fairy tail painted by the media.

It would fall apart unless their funding somehow scaled sustainably with the number of cases they had to argue. That is very unlikely to come from public donations if they&#x27;re doing something the public can&#x27;t observe.

5961208,comment,5960969,5961170,6,0,malandrew,,,"Build Event Graphs and wire them up to Sources (input) and Side Effects (output) to create Event Networks, that can be turned on, paused or dismantled.<p>This is the approach used in Haskell&#x27;s Reactive Banana and it&#x27;s declarative, making it very clean and easy to read. Since it&#x27;s functional, you can probably write tools to spit out all the possible event graphs in an app and the event networks that are actually wire up by the app when in use.<p>Better yet, you can make a module that records all the events at the Source input with timestamps and then use a timeline scrubber to play them forwards and backwards in many cases. I do this in an app I am building with animations. Every single thing that can be animated implements a function that takes an input from 0.0 to 1.0. Such functions can include changing opacity, z-depth, height, width, position along a bezier curve, etc.<p>For custom animations that are state dependent, I will often have a higher order function that takes some state of the world as an argument, creates a data structure representing the desired custom animation based on that state that can be looked up from 0.0 to 1.0. That function then returns another function that takes an state from [0..1] that is used to lookup the animation state in that data structure referenced by closure.<p>When I have lots of animations occurring simultaneously that need to be choreographed, I just create a state emitter that goes from 0 to 1 linearly over a predetermined amount of time.  That state emitter can be mapped to functions that change the curve from linear to all sorts of things like quadratic functions, step functions, binary on/off functions, etc. This all allows me to orchestrate a ton of animations, making things like this[0] and this[1] trivial.<p>[0] <a href=""http://watchingapple.com/2009/11/a-closer-look-at-iphone-transition-animations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://watchingapple.com/2009/11/a-closer-look-at-iphone-tra...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://watchingapple.com/2007/06/slide-to-unlock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://watchingapple.com/2007/06/slide-to-unlock/</a>",1372469384

Yahoo research has released the most innovative papers on search but nobody is there to take this from research to product. Instead you find google and bing implementing yahoo&#x27;s research, its amazing the quality of stuff that comes from there. I also noticed that a few of yahoo&#x27;s top researchers going to their rivals and then working on search. This is why i didn&#x27;t believe in the Marissa Mayer hire but i am hoping for the best. She is taking yahoo from a company with high intelligence to being a more low level media company like AOL, therefore most of their talent is going to waste, there is so many products they could be pushing out. The billion they dropped on tumblr could have be used to fund all those researchers crazy ideas, give them 10mill each to build intelligent applications that makes peoples everyday life easier, instead of buying CRUD startups to reach this goal.<p>If you look at yahoo latest earnings most of their money is coming from the Alibaba investment and their hedging of the yen, which seems to have been used to help pay for tumblr. Yahoo cannot buy their way out of this, just like steve jobs could not buy Apples way out during the 90&#x27;s instead they had to use their human capital and innovate their way out. I don;t know who should have led yahoo but i do know that their biggest strength was their human capital which is being wasted and marginalized.

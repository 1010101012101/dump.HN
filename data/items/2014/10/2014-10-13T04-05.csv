In my mind the most compelling arguments against lead-free are: of the studies of factory workers who work every day with lead/tin solder, they couldn&#x27;t find elevated blood lead levels; and that the fluxes in lead-free solders are both more exotic (i.e. less studied for adverse health effects) and a greater proportion of the solder.<p>The danger of absorbed lead is clear, but it&#x27;s not a straight line from there to lead-free solder.  Furthermore, the process that resulted in the EU (mostly) banning lead solder seems to be based more on the precautionary principle than any evidence of health or environmental damage from solder specifically.

You see yourself as a meritocratic person and you believe that people should be judged based on their merits.<p>Fair enough. It would be nice if the world worked that way. Unbiased meritocratic decision is impossible when the subject in question is to known to their interviewer by anything but their merits. As far as we know, it&#x27;s simply not possible to make meritocratic decisions when you know anything other than the subject&#x27;s merits. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re racist or sexist, everyone inevitably makes assumptions about other races and other genders. Not being racist and sexist is about realizing those assumptions are incorrect and suppressing them.<p>Take the case of professional orchestras for example. Before the 1970s and 80s, most professional orchestras were 5% women. In the 70s and 80s when blind auditions became the standard, that number rose to 25%. You don&#x27;t need to tell me that correlation doesn&#x27;t imply causation but if the data doesn&#x27;t say that to you I&#x27;m not sure what can.<p>People are awesome solely based on their merits, but acting like you have the capability to thusly judge them in such a perfect manner is silly.

The number of medical personnel infected in this current outbreak is particularly worrisome and we don&#x27;t yet understand the exact causes of this.<p>We do know that the strain in the current outbreak is different from those seen before, and that it&#x27;s mutating[1]. Filoviruses have a rapid rate of mutation, and the longer the outbreak lasts, the more opportunity the virus has to mutate into a form that makes it harder to defeat. The speed with which Ebola kills those it infects is actually disadvantageous to the virus. Natural selection would logically favor a strain of the virus that didn&#x27;t kill its hosts so quickly.<p>While a lot of speculation revolves around the possibility that the virus could become more easily transmissible, it would be just as worrisome if there were mutations that affected incubation time or the onset symptoms.

It is also the only method that can guarantee backward compatibility with the millions of existing websites that are not going to move to a different auth method anytime soon.<p>KeePass, LastPass, et al. have done a tremendous amount of work to make the experience as seamless as possible, but there are still a lot of rough edges because every website has different policies. If most websites agreed to accept strong passwords of a standard format (e.g. 32-byte string of ASCII printable characters), we could finish the automation and just treat passwords like any other key that websites exchange with us all the time.<p>About a year ago, I proposed that we should come up with a standard login API for websites to adopt, in order to improve the password manager UX [1]. There was quite a bit of discussion, but unfortunately the world seems to be much more interested in getting rid of passwords altogether, no matter how unrealistic it might be. Well, can&#x27;t blame them, it&#x27;s always more fun to create something new than to fix something that already exists.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5743057"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5743057</a>",1413173204

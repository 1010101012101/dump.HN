Somewhere out there exists a magical corpus of knowledge that every programmer should be able to memorize from heart. And then there's the world we live in now where you have a corpus of knowledge you do know and can build upon. Somewhere in between is a practical subset of knowledge that should be common but some feel isn't being represented well. The debate rages about what that suitable subset is.<p>What I think most people who bring this argument up fail to realize is that the full corpus of knowledge that embodies all of programming is far too large for a single programmer to understand. Good abstractions can be trusted to hide the unnecessary details. Great abstractions shouldn't mean piss-poor performance (and should infact provide just the opposite). They also get out of your way (or you avoid using them) when working in the problem domain where your ""low-level"" knowledge is more useful for the optimizations you can provide to your code.<p>I'm just not as OCD as some programmers. Yet I can still get good work done. I don't think I could do it without useful abstractions.",1312775738

My girlfriend and I were graduating from pharmacy school and she was applying for residency positions (yes, they have those for pharmacists). Well, she found out she got the one she really wanted and so that night we went out to a nice dinner to celebrate. We did it up like you would expect a happy couple to - nice bottle of wine, share an appetizer and dessert, etc. We were still living on loans at the time and so in my head I was keeping track of about how much the meal was going to run me at the end of the night (for better or worse - keep in mind we were in college at the time). We had easily cleared a hundred bucks (quite the meal for college students who usually eat $7 sandwiches or more likely cook for themselves!), and when it was time for the bill, our waitress told us ""The couple that was sitting over there paid for it.""<p>!<p>You wanna talk about made our day? Try made our week. We had seen the older couple earlier, but we didn't know them, and they were gone by the time we got our bill. We couldn't even thank them, and we were just so... shocked. Since then, whenever we go out for a nice meal, I look for a young couple who looks happy and in love, just waiting to return that favor.<p>C.S.

    finished because they dont expect the songs to be good.
    Most people are wrong about this, for one of two
    possible reasons:

    1. they are just being lazy and making up excuses for
       not finishing
    2. they are underestimating the quality of their work
       because they're looking at an unfinished product; if
       they saw how the finished product, they would think
       its okay.

Here's what Barton says:<p><i>There are lots of funny might have beens in connection with this. You didn't ask the question, why didn't the machine have index registers? [...] Well, I think that what happened really was something like this. We had Iverson as a consultant and I think Duncan MacDonald must have had a lot to do with arranging that. He was a consultant in engineering at the time, but that time when I was a Burroughs employee, I was asked to contribute some money from my budget. I agreed to doing that, and I remember going to a series of talks by Iverson, and my reaction was, ""Wow!"" He was still at Harvard at the time; he had an unpolished system (it was many years before the book was published), but I sat in that lecture thinking you can do the kind of things he's talking about in a machine with very little more hardware than it takes for three index registers. I used to argue against index registers on the grounds that ALGOL indexing was more general, but in the back of my mind I was hoping that the machine could have vector operations. I wasn't very good at convincing anybody of that; in fact, I failed again with the 6700 program. I failed. One of the customers convinced Burroughs to do a retrofit on vector operations at that time -- I don't think a very good job, either. But that's a perception I have that has nothing to do with the record. I bet Paul cannot produce a single item that will show that there was ever a suggestion that vector operations be built into the machine. Am I right?</i>",1312774999

You can give the designer a XIB file to style and modify to pixel precision. Android's layout editor still has a long way to catch up.<p>> same design... same visual elements<p>If you are using the same UX for both apps, you're doing your Android users a disservice.

Removing lots of stuff that is installed on a fresh system, configuring the services that the server will be running in, that intrincated ""debian like"" /etc, making shure no ubuntu specific configuration tool will destroy some configuration file edited by hand, etc...<p>About the LTS, I would like to remind you that it mean Long Time Support, not Long Time Server. As for the Fedora Core, I myself don't use it, but my previous experience with Red Hat lead me to believe it is easier for the Linux beginner than Debian.But you're probably right about that, Cento OS would probably be a better choice that a Fedora Core... but don't quote me on that cause my experience with Cent OS is almost null.",1211543991

197924,comment,197878,197908,0,0,jeremiah,,,"What would be required to get Unbuntu to perform as a server in your mind? Removing X windows? Hardening? Why wouldn't you just perform a minimal install of Ubunut's LTS for example? That has X disabled and no open ports by default - that is an excellent start for a public-facing server.<p>More info here: <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/serveredition/features/security"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/serveredition/fe...</a><p>Further more, Fedora is a johnny-come-lately, created when Red Hat closed their once open linux version. While they claim that Fedora will always be free, one wonders how much Red Hat supports Fedora since it obviously competes with their product. I think a truly, permanently free distro is a much better choice.",1211543196

Before being able to vote in the system I proposed, you have to have demonstrated to the current moderators (voters), that you are someone that on average posts interesting, thought-provoking stuff.<p>I don't know whether this would actually work, but it seems at least reasonable, and as far as I'm aware, it has not yet been tried",1211543186
197922,comment,197878,197901,0,0,jeremiah,,,"Not sure I agree with you there. Red Hat has gone a long way with their documentation - being a commercial linux distro requires solid documentation. So, to be fair, Red Hat probably has the best documentation. I have used debian / ubuntu for years and documentation can be quite spotty unfortunately.",1211542869
197920,comment,197878,197907,0,0,jeremiah,,,"debian is the ""universal"" operating system and runs on more hardware than any other linux distribution.<p>I love the *BSD UNIXes, but there are also ""issues"" there as well. The FreeBSD threading model does not work well with MySQL for example and you can see database problems there. I suspect Postgres on FreeBSD is more common and works rather well so you can go that route instead.<p>However, the original poster wanted info specifically about linux, and while a BSD UNIX is similar, there are enough differences that productivity at first might be diminished while one learns about the port system for packages as well as other differences.<p>I think it is a bit misleading to say that a distro like debian ""opens all doors"", that is not the case. And the recent OpenSSL problem not withstanding, debian is quite secure. In fact, the OpenSSL packaging issue shows that the debian security apparatus mostly works, and that the lessons learned are quickly being implemented. One must acknowledge however that this was a serious security problem on debian's side and in contrast OpenBSD has had _two_ exploits in _ten_ years. Those are some pretty sterling security credentials for OpenBSD.",1211542550
197919,comment,197878,197878,0,0,jeremiah,,,"Ubuntu is mostly debian, and they even support a LTS (Long Term Support) version of their software. debian has more software packages (@18,000) than any other distro, so you would have any linux software you need right at your fingertips. Ubuntu comes with commercial support from Canonical if you should need that, but I think you will find lots of Ubuntuistas out there willing to help for free in the fora and such.<p>My personal preference is for debian, but if you are already familiar with Ubuntu, then use that for you web server since you will be able to use your already hard-won knowledege and Ubuntu performs admirably.",1211542076

Every intelligent creature in this universe has to be able to do the same basic things: reproduce, manipulate objects, fend off predators, etc.</i><p>That's a very small scope of 'basic things' - it very well might be that it only applies to the results of evolution on earth. What about evolution in our universe on scales that aren't our size, that don't move at our speeds, that aren't made up of carbon/oxygen/etc?<p>What is there to stop an evolutionary processes from happening inside a star? It doesn't have to be our star, it could be a red giant - with entire complex evolutionary ""life"" constantly being created and destroyed in a matters of seconds - to them, the star is the accessible universe - it forms the fundamental fabric of their existence.<p>What is there to stop evolutionary processes to happen on a quantum level?<p>Most things in the universe don't happen at our speeds, and they don't happen at our size. And get really not-like-this-universe when you start thinking about relatively big things, or relatively little things.",1211540727

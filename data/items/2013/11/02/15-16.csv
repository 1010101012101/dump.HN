6659473,comment,6654905,6654905,3,0,robomartin,,,"I can see how a software developer could put hardware last, particularly when working with an established platform.  I get that.<p>Coming from the other side of the fence, a place where we develop the hardware first and then bring it to life through software things are very different.<p>The first step in bringing up a not-trivial board is to go through a full characterization phase.  This is where electrical, mechanical and short software tests are performed in order to determine if the hardware is operating according to requirements.  Depending on the nature of the hardware this period can last months and require many re-spins (iterations where something is fixed or modified).<p>While this is taking place, and depending on the nature of the team, the application software is probably starting to be assembled on prototype hardware. In some cases this can&#x27;t happen until you have actual hardware that works reasonably close to specs.  Perhaps rev-1 hardware is used to jump-start software development while the hardware team goes through many revs in order to make adjustments and fix problems.<p>Seemingly weird hardware problems abound.  I have been in situations where the signal is good at one end of a trace or cable and not so good at the other end.  In the case of high speed design this can easily happen if there are problems with the design of the transmission lines carrying the signals.  You can easily end-up with reflections that will wreck havoc on the signals as the go down the transmission line.<p>Another &quot;weird&quot; hardware issue in high speed design are signals that don&#x27;t arrive at the destination within a specific timing window.  Dynamic ram designs are one example of this.  A clock is used to gate various signals at both ends of the transaction.  Everything is sampled relative to this clock.  If some signals, for example, control signals, arrive before, after or staggered with respect to their acceptance window you can have really weird effects.<p>With large FPGA designs you can have issues related to faulty design of the power distribution system.  Power and signal integrity are major fields of study and truly necessary parts of modern electronics design.  Traces on a board are like capacitors that need to be charged and discharged.  If you have 200 traces switching from 0 to 1 simultaneously a lot of current will be require of the power system within nanoseconds (or picoseconds).  If the power distribution system on the board isn&#x27;t designed to deal with such transients you end-up with all manner of weird effects.  For example, transmission lines might be perfect in impedance, crosstalk and time of flight yet signals arrive with lots of jitter and all over the place in terms of timing.  The power distribution system on a board is like your heart, if it can&#x27;t deal with demand you are not going to go from sitting to standing and then running without major problems.<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg.  I could go on for pages and probably write a book about this.  I&#x27;ve made enough mistakes.<p>And so, from the vantage point of a software engineer who also happens to be a hardware engineer blaming the hardware almost always comes first until the hardware is proven to be operating according to requirements.<p>In terms of the playstation issue on the original post.  Well, from my perspective this is simply bad engineering on the part of those who designed the hardware.  OK, this isn&#x27;t the engine control computer on a Toyota.  The sentiment is the same.  Fault tolerant design is important, even for toys.  Think consumer drones.",1383406417

Summer nights should be light until 9:00pm; that goes back to childhood and just seems &quot;right&quot;. (I know that that&#x27;s an emotional argument with no reasonable backing.) On the other hand, I don&#x27;t it to be dark at 8:00 in the morning in the dead of winter, so I prefer the reversion to standard time in the winter.<p>Want proof that it&#x27;s cultural? It starts in March and ends in November. Lightwise, March is the midpoint while November is almost the darkest part of the year-- but not cold yet. DST follows the temperature, not the light. People wouldn&#x27;t like it if they left work in darkness during the high foliage season of October. Hell, I wouldn&#x27;t like that.<p>What&#x27;s really going on, of course, is that DST forces everyone to do everything an hour earlier during the lighter months. In companies that care about presence down to exact minutes (thankfully, those are rare in tech) it becomes socially acceptable to work 8-5 instead of 9-6, because everyone is calling 8:00, 9:00. This prevents all that light in the morning from getting wasted, because people are tricked into getting up earlier than they otherwise would. They think getting up at 6:00 is for old people and gym rats, but that&#x27;s exactly what they do for 8 months out of the year.<p>People who work the standard workday want: (a) at least an hour and a half of light <i>before</i> they leave for work (typically, 8:30); (b) darkness by one hour before the average bedtime (about 10:45), and (c) as much evening light as possible during the nicest months (April, May; September, October) of the year. DST is the hack that makes that possible.<p>One could argue, on the other hand, that it would be better for people to just adapt to asynchrony in work and social life and thus make it irrelevant whether we call the summer sunset &quot;7:30&quot; or &quot;8:30&quot;... but most people don&#x27;t have that luxury.",1383405035

Putting a breakpoint on a line that just deals with the error code immediately after the error code will reliably display the error in the Auto Variables watch window in VStudio maligning it very convenient for rapid debugging.",1383404756

6659382,comment,6656728,6656728,1,0,robomartin,,,"And this, boys and girls, is what entrepreneurship looks like more often than not.  The &quot;over the weekend&quot; stories are rare corner cases.  In the vast majority of cases you have to be prepared to slog it out for an extended period of time before you start to see success.  And that&#x27;s one of the huge reasons for which most new businesses fail.  Not everyone has the intestinal fortitude to, in the face of adversity, keep pushing forward.<p>@dumbfounder<p>First of all, I wish you had chosen a different handle on HN.  You are not dumb at all.  You are, in fact, a real asset to anyone who might want to launch a startup or get behind a difficult idea.  I don&#x27;t know if you project will ultimately succeed.  Hard to tell.  You, on the other hand, are an absolute success.<p>I know that from your current perspective it might seem you wasted a decade in this journey.  I simply don&#x27;t see it that way.<p>You&#x27;ve received plenty of design and functional advise on this thread with regards to twicsy.  The first thing I thought about was something that came up in a discussion on HN a couple of days ago.  Here&#x27;s my short comment on that thread:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6647818"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6647818</a><p>In my view that still rings true for twicsy.  In other words, you have to deliver value that is not found elsewhere and that people are willing to pay for.  Im my post I speak of the fact that the vast majority of news websites are regurgitated versions of the news item source, whereas there are a very few who provide you with real incremental value by taking the time to research and give you perspective.<p>If you are still interested in making twicsy a success perhaps you should start thinking laterally rather than vertically.  In other words, don&#x27;t stay on your current path.  Explore other paths.  I know that&#x27;s easier said than done.  For example:  How might corporate marketing programs be able to use your service?  Celebrities?  Bloggers?  How about a path to licensing some of these pictures?  Not through you, through whoever owns the rights with you making a small percentage on the sale.<p>Don&#x27;t give up.  Pivot.",1383404667

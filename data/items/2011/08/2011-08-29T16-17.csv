Left to right:<p>arrows going both directions, one is grayed out.

How do I create folders? How do I delete things? How do I rename something? Provided I can figure out that this is a representation of the hierarachical file structure, is there a way to copy or move files between different parts of the file system? How do I add or remove ""places""? etc.<p>The principle problems are that the finder is simultaneously underpowered.
It also hi-lights something that's sadly becoming more and more common in Apple's interfaces, a lack of <i>discoverability</i>.

There are bugs and glitches and loads of other little things. I love Minecraft but it's frustrating, for example, that minecarts get stuck to each other when going e/w but not n/s. It's a non-trivial bug.<p>From watching him code and also reading about how to change the height limits in Minecraft it appears to me that he may slip into some questionable coding practices at times. I've not read the code but it left me wondering why isn't there a single global height variable, never hard code numbers! I watched him copy and paste chunks of code and then manually change variables, often missing some and then having to go back. Again, not a good idea if you don't want to introduce bugs unless you're coding for fun. Cut and paste should really be disabled on programmer's machines!<p>Not that I'm criticizing, I've done the same thing. But proof of concepts are far easier than finished products, even unpolished finished products.<p>It's fun to play with a new concept. But most of the time it's not so fun to put in the effort to polish it or keep a tight code base. In fact it's downright laborious.<p>Just off the top of my head when you sit down and really have to code instead of coding for fun there's time, boredom, mental effort, lines of code, language limitations, testing methods, deployment, project management and on and on that are all resources to be managed. And if you do it for yourself there's also the constant doubt nagging you.<p>Are you doing the right thing?<p>So while the glib soundbites are fun, they're very misleading, lets sniff a little reality.<p>If you are a programmer, it can be tough to push stuff over the finish line.<p>Adding the dull login system or the annoying signup page, both trivial and so mundane, are usually much harder than implementing that tricky calculation.<p>I do think that doing something like that challenge is an excellent way to remind yourself why you got into coding in the first place.

The worse we had to do was to handle a bunch of corner cases due to some non-null terminated string handling and be wary of a silly global var which could have bitten us otherwise when multithreading. The extend functionality was awesome to make structs more object-oriented by adding a few key methods.<p>The key was to handle the resulting Python module as a low level C wrapper effectively allowing us to write ""managed C"" in Python, which we encapsulated neatly in a library with a much more pythonic API. We then naturally went all the way up and implemented SQL-like API (no parser, just methods) and a Django model subset. A SQL subset parser and DBAPI compliance were planned features. All of that allowed us to develop new features in Python and on Django while maintaining compatibility with the old components (also thanks to Django multi-db support) and making the planned switch to a complete SQL database a drop-in replacement.",1314635054

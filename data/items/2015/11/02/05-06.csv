Unless HN hands out additional powers, which I have not been granted, you cannot downmod my responses to you. I did not mean to rush you (nor were my two parent posts in any way directed at you).<p>I will read your post now.<p>Edit: And likely post edit this post with responses.<p>>I can see it caused you enough distress to post twice.<p>I hope I was clear before, but I feel the need to state it clearly: you have not distressed me.<p>------------<p>Ok, many points are not relevant, but I&#x27;ll respond.<p>>Let me be straightforward with you, since you seem to be the sort that will not appreciate the standard cultural niceties.<p>Thank you.<p>>So perhaps maybe you just did a poor job to express your specific point as you tripped over yourself to demonstrate to everyone you have read a bit of philosophy and logic.<p>I am waiting for the Straw Man.<p>> But it certainly would be reasonable that you entered a conversation without invitation responding to<p>No invitation required here.<p>>> That the reasoning is fallacious doesn&#x27;t make the conclusion incorrect.<p>This actually depends on the conclusion. It depends on how all the words are defined, but basically, people come to non-real conclusions all the time.<p>>With:<p>>> However, if you study the truth table a bit longer, you will realize that you should stop reading any text which contains fallacious or self-contradictory logic.<p>>Implying that if you could construe any single statement in my post as lacking in robustness from a logical perspective, then you should simply ignore the entire thing.<p>My response was not directed at you. No, seriously. Go check the post history.<p>Also, that is basically the implication. And it&#x27;s basically true. It&#x27;s pretty much what you should do. Of course, there are many reasons not too: historical, curiosity, &quot;maybe I read it wrong&quot;, etc. However, according the the rule of logic: there is no reason to consider fallacious logic in regards to any particular conclusion.<p>>This is regardless of the author&#x27;s intent that this actually be a real point, or perhaps just a literary device or joke. One might actually read the whole post first, notice there is some technical substance, and come to a different conclusion before posting.<p>Fallacies should be called out as soon as they are detected. Consider the alternative: you are operating on fallacious logic. Good luck!<p>>This impression is further reinforced by your frustration over rate limiting as you implied that my response,<p>Again, my apologies for the confusion, but those frustrations were not directed at you, nor were/are they about you. You seem like a mostly pleasant person. (seriously)<p>>specifically saying that I didn&#x27;t actually present my tautology as anything but a cute literary device to open what I considered to be a rather dry if somewhat acidic post.<p>And, yes. The Straw Man has not been presented (in my ~20min analysis).<p>>You said,<p>>> I&#x27;ve been rate-limited, so any fallacious (or non) arguments posted in response will need to wait a while for a proper response (some have already been typed up).<p>>Which from my perspective certainly looks like you were ready to fire off a post explaining to me with as many latin words as possible aimed at trying to prove exactly that.<p>The response I gave you is what I wrote up immediately before receiving the rate limit notice. I just kept the tab open and tried to post it every so often. I may have edited slightly after the first post attempt. I&#x27;d go read my response, then read the post the response was for, then come back here and read the above excerpt from your post.<p>>Perhaps, in the future, you may want to consider efficacy first and strict correctness secondly when discussing things in a casual forum with the (entirely barbaric, I agree) feature of &quot;downvoting.&quot;<p>Please consider in any future encounters with me that I have already considered such concerns. Efficacy without correctness is madness. I cannot guarantee that I have considered all concerns, however.<p>>Or perhaps just not entering conversations you don&#x27;t have anything substantial to add to.<p>I&#x27;m not not sure what this means. I don&#x27;t consider posting a response on HN to be &quot;entering conversations&quot;. It&#x27;s some text in a tree, people can read it or not.<p>>You might feel some irritation at this, because it can seem like an anti-intellectual stance. Sadly, you&#x27;re existing in a community that has to deal with many people perpetually misusing terms like &quot;ad hominem&quot; and &quot;genetic fallacy&quot; and &quot;truth table&quot; in the worst way, to the point where it&#x27;s a cognitive shortcut to simply pass it by or perhaps even express this cultural signal via downvotes.\nI don&#x27;t like it very much either, but cultural norms are not something we rationally argue with but instead can only hope to influence gradually.<p>I just try to point out the flaws as I see them.

Autonomy and autarky, not narrow specialization, are necessary and are fueled by an understanding that tools must be mastered to keep nature in its proper place.&quot;<p>In reality, the rural areas of the USA are wards of the state. Without government subsidies for water and electricity and telephone services, and without government subsidies for the food that farmers grow, many of the rural areas in the USA would have stopped agricultural production back during the 1930s.<p>This is strange:<p>&quot;urbanites have argued that farmers can make do with less but wildlife needs ever more&quot;<p>I would have thought that a conservative like Victor David Hanson would have been angry about the massive subsidies that the government offers to farmers, but apparently he doesn&#x27;t care about that. Thanks to those subsidies, the USA typically produces too much food, not too little of it. Scaling back on those subsidies a bit, for a good environmental cause, seems like classical stewardship in action: the state is suppressing the demands of a greedy special interest, in favor of a project which benefits all of society.<p>I am disappointed that Hanson seems to support government subsidies when it comes to farmers (in the form of water subsidies), but then turns critical of government subsidies when it comes to helping an individual woman. Hanson writes this criticism of the fictional &quot;Julia&quot;:<p>&quot;Looking to cement his lead among urban unmarried women during his 2012 reelection campaign, Barack Obama ran an interactive Web ad, &quot;The Life of Julia.&quot; Its dependency narrative defined the life of an everywoman character as one of cradle-to-grave government reliance — a desirable thing. Julia is proudly and perennially a ward of the state. She can get through school only thanks to Head Start and federally backed student loans. Only the Small Business Administration and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act enable her to find work. In her retirement years, only Social Security and Medicare allow her comfort and the time to volunteer for a communal urban garden, apparently a hobby rather than a critical food source.&quot;<p>So helping big agri-business with government subsidies of water is perfectly acceptable, but helping a woman go to college is a terrible thing?",1446443024

Fully 3/4 of Southern whites did not even own slaves; of those who did, 88% owned twenty or fewer. Whites who did not own slaves were primarily yeoman farmers. Practically speaking, the institution of slavery did not help these people. And yet most non-slaveholding white Southerners identified with and defended the institution of slavery. Though many resented the wealth and power of the large slaveholders, they aspired to own slaves themselves and to join the priviledged ranks. In addition, slavery gave the farmers a group of people to feel superior to. They may have been poor, but they were not slaves, and they were not black. They gained a sense of power simply by being white.&quot; <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2956.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2956.html</a>",1446442676

The situations I encountered went FAR beyond that.<p>Sociologists/anthropologists and urban planners need to broaden their perspective with regard to this, in my opinion, when considering contemporary U.S. environments and their like.<p>Further, I can add that I have made upwards of 10 good friends in the last decade.  Not neighbors -- although I am friendly with several of them -- but people who, while differing in details and some beliefs and opinions, are kind and respectful.<p>So... is it that we don&#x27;t have &quot;casual interactions&quot; near our homes?  Or, is something else going on?  Probably some of each.<p>Again, if you want to promote higher density living, amongst other things ameliorate the noise issues.  Better sound-proofing.  Effective ordinances.",1446441722

If you use high precision floats you can roundtrip somewhat more reliably, but it&#x27;s still a bad bet. So if you first change the Hue and then change the Saturation, you&#x27;ll get some really nasty artifacts at some points in the color space. (For example, if you try to set the Hue of solid black, it won&#x27;t do anything.)<p>A better approach for HSV is to just have a value that represents a point in the HSV color space, and convert it once to/from RGBA when you need to. Do as much in a given color space as you can. (Also, when dealing with HSV you simply need more precision than 24bpp rgb. I typically used 16 bits per channel to reduce the amount of error.)<p>For cases where you want to do HSV and you care about performance, you could probably use the new .NET SIMD types like System.Numerics.Vector4. Then you&#x27;d be getting a perf boost from native SIMD operations and you could carry your channels around as float32.",1446441374

You couldn&#x27;t be punished just for thinking about stolen goods.<p>Analyzing intent is important to differentiate between people who have likely already learned from their mistake, and those who are likely to exploit others in the future. Punishment is only necessary in the latter case.",1446440792

Explain how this works in somewhat more detail; 10-15 pages should get it across. Sure it&#x27;s work. But you seem resolved, and the reward is great. If you pull this off, not only are you gonna get a Turing award, they&#x27;re going to mint a whole <i>new</i> award and name it after you. Anyway, give it a decent treatment and mail it off.<p>2. Tell us how that went over.<p>Hundreds of thousands, heck, <i>millions</i> of pretty smart people have been thinking of ways to solve &quot;the software problem&quot; for over 60 years. Many of those people are smarter than I am, and probably smarter than most of the readership on HN. The actual improvements have been incremental.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there hasn&#x27;t been improvement. For instance, we tend to write more secure systems these days, but security remains really, really hard. Saying &quot;you&#x27;re doing it all wrong&quot; to the incredibly smart and driven people I know who are experts in security is pretty bold.<p>So, I urge you to make a proposal and report back.",1446440748

I can see it caused you enough distress to post twice.<p>Let me be straightforward with you, since you seem to be the sort that will not appreciate the standard cultural niceties.<p>So perhaps maybe you just did a poor job to express your specific point as you tripped over yourself to demonstrate to everyone you have read a bit of philosophy and logic. But it certainly would be reasonable that you entered a conversation without invitation responding to<p>> That the reasoning is fallacious doesn&#x27;t make the conclusion incorrect.<p>With:<p>> However, if you study the truth table a bit longer, you will realize that you should stop reading any text which contains fallacious or self-contradictory logic.<p>Implying that if you could construe any single statement in my post as lacking in robustness from a logical perspective, then you should simply ignore the entire thing. This is regardless of the author&#x27;s intent that this actually be a real point, or perhaps just a literary device or joke. One might actually read the whole post first, notice there is some technical substance, and come to a different conclusion before posting.<p>This impression is further reinforced by your frustration over rate limiting as you implied that my response, specifically saying that I didn&#x27;t actually present my tautology as anything but a cute literary device to open what I considered to be a rather dry if somewhat acidic post.<p>You said,<p>> I&#x27;ve been rate-limited, so any fallacious (or non) arguments posted in response will need to wait a while for a proper response (some have already been typed up).<p>Which from my perspective certainly looks like you were ready to fire off a post explaining to me with as many latin words as possible aimed at trying to prove exactly that.<p>Perhaps, in the future, you may want to consider efficacy first and strict correctness secondly when discussing things in a casual forum with the (entirely barbaric, I agree) feature of &quot;downvoting.&quot; Or perhaps just not entering conversations you don&#x27;t have anything substantial to add to.<p>You might feel some irritation at this, because it can seem like an anti-intellectual stance. Sadly, you&#x27;re existing in a community that has to deal with many people perpetually misusing terms like &quot;ad hominem&quot; and &quot;genetic fallacy&quot; and &quot;truth table&quot; in the worst way, to the point where it&#x27;s a cognitive shortcut to simply pass it by or perhaps even express this cultural signal via downvotes.<p>I don&#x27;t like it very much either, but cultural norms are not something we rationally argue with but instead can only hope to influence gradually.",1446440715

Instead, he falls back onto the focus on energy that doomed the USSR. The US dollar goes on a big run, China&#x27;s growth slows, US oil producers add four million barrels per day, and just like that Russia sinks into the abyss again. Russians are now spending half their income on just food alone, with their economy collapsing by 1/3 in dollar terms in just 18 months.<p>What did the US do to cause that? That&#x27;s Russia&#x27;s fault.<p>The same goes for what is happening to Brazil right now. They rode the fake boom good times on the back of a debased US dollar. Now that fake boom is over, the weak dollar has gone away, and with that tide going out, so has Brazil&#x27;s economy.<p>Whose fault is that? It&#x27;s only Brazil&#x27;s fault.<p>Did the US force China to take on tens of trillions in debt to fake economic growth where there was none after the global consumer crashed in 2008? Nope, just like Japan before them, they did it to themselves willingly so they wouldn&#x27;t have to admit the party was over.<p>The US hasn&#x27;t had to do anything to these countries to hold them at an economic disadvantage, they&#x27;re doing it to themselves.",1446440591

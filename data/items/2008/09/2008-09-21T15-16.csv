310423,comment,310359,310412,0,0,ajross,,,"Actually, asymptotically (as you peel off the overhead) I'm sure they're in a dead tie.  Ultimately, serving a static file consists of reading the header, opening the target file and calling the sendfile() syscall.  The bulk of the work is obviously the data transfer, and on a modern OS that happens in the kernel.  I have a hard time believing that any web server is going to significantly distinguish itself on the basis of header parsing, of all things.<p>And since when is service of static files a significant performance problem anyway?  Unless you're youtube, this is the <i>easy</i> part of web application optimization.",1222012586
310422,comment,308332,310146,0,0,jlouis,,,"I weren't clear enough, sorry.<p>Yes, it is extremely hard to add lisp-style macros to C or Java because they have no s-expression structure you can work on. And they do not want an s-expression structure because it is too alien for those programmers. Thus, they perceive that macros are not worth the effort.<p>I think macros are left out of so many languages because people <i>do not know</i> how to incorporate them while retaining other desirable properties of the language (type safety for instance).<p>Also, macros are not the only way to build ORM systems. Python does the same with metaclassing as an example. But we can agree on that trying to map it into a statically typed language with reflection/AOP as Java did is doomed to fail I think ;)<p>I am not trying to say that macros are useless. I am trying to say that some languages leave them out on purpose. Many problems on which macros look nice can be solved with a little extra thought on representation. But then again, many can not.<p>I see the discussion of macros/no-macros a bit like the discussion on static/dynamic typing. With static typing, we <i>know</i> we are leaving some valid programs outside the gates of the static world. But we think that this loss is negligible compared to the benefits a static check gives us. Yet, some people oppose this viewpoint and wants the valid programs as well, because they perceive the benefits of the static typing to the negligible. Both approaches are valid, but it currently looks like it is hard to get all of the cake in one munch.",1222012521

I've been doing some research on the two and I have to say people at the SliceHost forum suggest that MySQL can rival Postgres if you turn off certain modules (like skipping InnoDB).",1222012102

If you really want performance from apache you can make it very fast, and there's tons of different ways to have kick ass caching inside apache. Though I'd say that lighttpd is probably faster with tweaks. The reason to go for apache is battle tested stability, robustness and extensibility.",1222010603

By adding a second hand into the mix, shooting an underhanded shot you open up the process for more error.<p>Barry cannot be used as a meaningful example. Far more players have achieved success (and even greater success) using the traditional 1-handed shot.  Even the world record holder for most consecutive shots used the traditional method.<p>The superiority of the granny-shot is just another myth spread by those who don't really know the sport.",1222010329

Machine tools have a limited set of operations because the cutter head has to reach what it is cutting without interference. Complex parts require can require several tool changes as a result. Printers can create overhangs and cavities that would be very difficult or impossible with machine tools.  3-d printed objects also don't need to be clamped down while working, which makes setup much faster.<p>Though machines and setup are still very expensive, the raw materials in 3d printing can be very cheap compared to steel or aluminum. (And more advanced materials are available if you need greater structural integrity.)<p>Mills are significantly more dangerous than printers as well. Even with ""advanced safety protocols"" mills have heavy rotating components and very sharp cutters backed with powerful motors (otherwise they would be pretty worthless tools.) The products that come out of them often have sharp edges that need additional operations to clean up. Printers can get hot or pinch you and require respect, but I think they are significantly less scary.<p>I could  see a world where 5-axis CNC mills were much more pervasive, but I don't see them in every garage.",1327909543

I'm confident an Apple rep would say that the iPhone was a prestige product <i>because</i> Apple produced both the hardware and software; that the ""cachet and desirability"" of their products are a direct result of a single editorial voice.<p>I haven't used any Android-based phones, so I can't say whether or not existing offerings match the fit and polish of an iPhone. Judging by your own comments, I will assume that none currently do, which makes me ponder a few questions.<p>Question One: If an Android-based phone were to achieve a level of integration between hardware and software comparable to the iPhone, would that put the lie to Apple's claims that keeping everything under one roof is their recipe for success? Or would a hardware manufacturer have to ""own"" the operating system for this to occur? Will Amazon eventually achieve Apple-like user satisfaction with the Kindle Fire <i>because</i> they forked Android?<p>Question Two: Is Jony Ive really as talented as the business press claims? Is <i>he</i> - or, more generally, is superior industrial design - Apple's secret weapon?<p>Question Three: Assuming question two is true, is Ive's level of design talent really that rare, that Samsung, HTC, Amazon, or Motorola cannot find an individual with competing skill?<p>Question Four: (Again assuming Ive's talent is a significant differentiator)  Given that Ive was marking time, unrecognized and unappreciated, within Apple until Jobs' return, is it likely that a company requires a (hopefully benevolent) Dictator For Life in order to achieve the greatness that so often eludes decision-by-committee? Are there examples of best-of-breed products (in a similar or related industry) produced antithetically to Apple's methodology?",1327907761

3527796,comment,3526571,3526571,7,0,pinaceae,,,"Working for a company that serves big pharma, I have the following observations:<p>The iPad is <i>the</i> game changer for the mobile worker (pharma reps). Companies are taking away their sales reps MS laptops/tablets and replacing them with iPads. Why?<p>1., Unbreakable compared to classic hardware. Both in hardware as in software. No moving parts, light, powerful enough, so easy to use that reps can't claim anymore to be baffled by it. Cheap. No enterprise MS tablet PC comes close.<p>2., Far lower TCO, as the IT overhead is far lower. Virus Scanners? Custom OS images? Gone. A fully controlled, curated environment. Even if a user installs something, it will not break the system or steal your data. If an iPad gets stolen/lost, remote wipe and buy a new one. Log in, restore, done. Apple suddenly allows for bring your own hardware - the wet dream of enterprise IT.<p>3., Completely homogenic hardware, <i>globally</i>. This is the most important point. Wherever you buy an iPad, from Brazil to Korea, it is exactly the same. Same hardware, same OS. With notebooks? Lenovo, HP, Dell. And they change their models all the time, warranting a new driver here, a different OS image there.<p>4., The death of Blackberry is on the wall, making the iPhone the natural successor - for the above points.<p>Now, what about the MacBooks and iMacs? Looking at my company, once the iPad is in, those follow. If the majority of users is on iOS, there are no benefits of being on Windows. Most admins like Unix-style anyhow, and OSX is a great UI for that.<p>Managers are the ones left, and here the MacBook Air is gaining traction.  It is sleek, light, and works. Plus, IT can standardize on it. Also, as people create slide decks, Keynote is seriously cool shit. Those presentations work seamlessly on iPad, whereas PPT breaks. Strong incentive there to switch.<p>The last big footholds of MS in the Office are Excel and Outlook. But both are available on OSX, and some argue in better shape than their Windows brethren. The biggest gap of Apple is Excel on the iPad. Whoever releases a fully compatible iOS Excel version/clone will accelerate the demise of MS in enterprise desktops.<p>Servers are completely different discussion, the MS Exchange/Sharepoint/Dynamics/SQL Server behemoth is here to stay. This battleground will shift due to SaaS.",1327907043

One of the advantages of the JVM is that many different languages can interoperate easily, but if you do source-to-source translation to a non-JVM language, then the origin languages (e.g., Java) that have this extra support become preferred, and thus discourage the adoption of the better languages. E.g., GWT prevents us from completely migrating to Scala.<p>It seems as if it would be better to have have a JVM byte code to Python byte code translator, or something like that, if such a thing is possible. But I should think that it would be even better and easier to just have a version of the JVM (or an option on the JVM) that  starts up much faster.<p>If you're happy with just Java, doesn't BeanShell start up more quickly?

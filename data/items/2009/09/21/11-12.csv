It makes interesting reading; much of it subjective.<p>For example YC has funded astronomically MORE startups than many other funds. On the other hand very few have exited or obtained more funding - and a large number are completely dead (compared to other funds).<p>Techstars has a much much lower ""dead"" rate and a much higher follow on funding rate.<p>Seedcamp have the ""best"" success rate (in terms of follow on funding) but fund one of the fewest number of startups.<p>All of that data though is pretty useless for actually comparing them. For example the Seedcamp follow on funding might be as a result of their manouvering of VC's towards the startups and not much to do with the viability of the product. Or the startups coming through YC might well have a tendancy to fail regularly - but the community of startup operators it creates might be huge; and the connections they all make might ensure their second or third venture DOE succeed with a nice fat exit.<p>What Im trying to say is comparing the ""success"" of an incubator is probably an unbelievably tough task.",1253533612

Wired implies that Tweetie is a killer app <i>if</i> you use Twitter with multiple accounts. That's an edge case even among Twitter users, and Twitter is not an enormous web site. It's like saying the Facebook app is a killer app because it's gorgeous and provides near-full site functionality right now. It <i>is</i>, and it <i>does</i>, but say I'm writing an article about an app that I'm claiming ""justifies"" your entire app purchase. It doesn't help me look serious when I go on to say ""Oh, also this one Twitter application is <i>just as justifying</i>. <i>Seriously</i>, accessing Twitter like <i>this</i> is as important as being able to store and read articles offline.""<p><i>just as I expect that people who believe in the myth of the Wonderful Hacker News Comment Community will downmod all such comments into oblivion</i><p>It's not the sarcasm that isn't welcome. It's the sarcasm when dealing with subjects worthy of discussion. You know?

If we were talking about some ridiculous subject, then sarcasm is totes coo'.<p><i>As for ""discourse"", well, I've been active here for a while and lurking for longer, and my first impression was that HN was a site that syndicated TechCrunch articles.

Then, you can go reinvest your ""shitload"" in something more intelligent like car insurance or a new graphics card.<p>The problem is that in my country you cannot get a prescription without a doctor’s appointment. What happens (at least with me) is that I wait to see if I get better by myself.<p>> You're right. Health care should be like sex. Free only, illegal otherwise, immoral regardless. There should be laws to enforce this.<p>Nowhere did I claim that. What I meant was that doctors have a conflict of interest. On the one hand they should care for your health and on the other hand they should make as much money as possible. That causes a lot of doctors to prescribe unnecessary tests and perform unnecessary x-rays. In my country there was a law that allowed doctors to sell medicine (usually a pharmacy had to be owned by a pharmacist). This caused a lot of doctors to give out overly expensive medicine that people do not need.<p>> Say no.<p>And the doctor will tell you that <i>it is really necessary</i>. Since most people do not know the field they will believe the doctor with blind trust.<p>> Also, doctors prescribe generally prescribe what will be most likely to work the fastest because ---if you remember from a century ago--- bacterial infections kill you and then spread to your friends and family to kill them.<p>They actually do that to make money (see above).<p>> They don't care that you can save $30 with some similar drug they don't know much about.<p>Those “similar drugs” are run of the mill anti-biotics that have been on the market for 20+ years.",1253531494

It's ""ok"" now to be vaguely anti-white/anti-black in an ""im not <i>really</i> racist, honest"" way. With just the one attitude in the room your probably ok (just get a bit of awkwardness) but with both the divide is doubled and problems appear.<p>I get frustrated with some of the big ""anti-racism"" campaigners; they strike me as making the smaller issues big ones and causing divisions all over again.<p>On the specific issue I think it's not so much because the students are black they have this attitude - just because they are in a minority and have the anti-majority sentiment. I saw a similar problem at my school when girls where let into the all male establishment for the first time. Even though girls tend to do better academically at that age in our school they did worse and had higher rates of no homework completion/detention (as I recall). Im guessing for very similar reasons.<p>To be honest though I think parents are the main problem; and not just in minority groups now. Even my Aunt who is in her early 40's has no interest in her kids schooling - and they suffer for it.

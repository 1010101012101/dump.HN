I think it'd be effective though, and there's no chance the police will be able to prosecute  on the random and unspecified claims of murdering people - you can't simply be convicted on the basis of a vague confession. The jury would do a bit of googling even though they shouldnt and there you have it; reasonable doubt.",1203860613
122472,comment,122350,122350,0,0,mercurio,,,"Gladwell's writing is very seductive but frequently wrong. I  like to think of it as speculative non-fiction. It has the same mind-expanding qualities as good SF, and its connection to reality can be just as tenuous.<p>It is very easy to make up a plausible sounding theory. The harder part is making sure it has no holes in it. The hardest part is proving it. To show how easy the first part is, let me, as a layperson, give an alternative evolutionary explanation for why it makes sense that (some) people can accurately judge others in a short amount of time:<p>Consider an intelligent social species. When two strangers meet, the ability to judge accurately and to be favorably judged, both lead to better fitness. Lets assume there are situations where intelligence is the dominant quality that is being evaluated. Now if you are intelligent, you want to honestly communicate this, so its in your best interest to aid the judgement of the other person. If you are not, then its preferable to be dishonest and lie. Now the interesting part is that the ability to lie effectively is highly correlated with intelligence, since lying takes more cognitive effort than just telling the truth. So if you aren't intelligent, you also can't lie well enough to fool an intelligent judge. And if you are intelligent, you don't need to lie. This evolutionary dynamic  can easily lead to a state where intelligent individuals can quickly judge the intelligence of others, because they don't have to  worry about other intelligent people fooling them.",1203860497

I can see people's eyebrows furrowing, ""Oh, she's one of those new-fangled, ""Western socialists""  I see now.""<p>Whatever she is, at the very least the idea put forth is original, and, to the extent its true, disturbing, and, to the extent that it's true enough to allow us to predict, then it's useful to.<p>Think about it: let's say some ""horrible thing"" happens some time over the next year.<p>According to her view, first we'll see politicians on t.v. assuring us that ""everything will be alright"" and that ""help is on the way."" although no specific help is mentioned.<p>Then while we're huddled together scared and confused, wall street, major corporations and washington PACs will rush to put together deals that will wind up turning into some scandal 3 years from now.<p>Then three years later, we'll all look at the headlines and wonder, ""They did what?  When the hell did they put that together?  I don't recall reading about that!  Oh - wait - that was when XYZ disaster happened - that's right - I was too busy calling my relatives in the area to see if they were alright to be busy worrying what kind of business deals walls street was putting together.""<p>Seriously - say a disaster happens - do you expect anything BUT that scenario to happen?<p>Here's a quick test for you: bush's family has had affiliations with Exxon all the way back to when it was called Standard Oil.<p>All the global instability caused by bush in the last 8 years has driven oil up to sky high prices.<p>Exxon corporation, during bush's reign, has more than doubled in market valuation, on the basis of nothing more than rise in oil prices, to over half a TRILLION dollars.<p>Did you know that?  Like most people, I bet not.  You were too busy trying to figure out how to survive the current market crisis, ie, you're too busy trying to refinance your home, negotiate with whatever credit company just jacked your rates up because they're losing money on defaults, etc.<p>See how that works?  You're busy trying to keep your head above water, the fat cats are making hundreds of billions in ways that don't benefit you and are often at your expense.  If you weren't dealing with all the problems you are in life, would you agree to that?  No, of course you wouldn't.  Ergo, the fatcats have an economic incentive to keep causing you problems so you never have enough free time / mental energy to figure out how they're screwing you.",1203859724

But it's also a wonderful new opportunity to try some ideas I've been trying to get adopted for years.""<p>Again, I don't really know Friedman, but could it not simply be that his work was motivated by trying to improve human lives? It is pretty natural to consider in the face of disaster what might have caused it and what might have prevented it.<p>To make things clear, I was among the ones who would have no problem believing that 09/11 was staged. It happens all the time, in fact, it is standard practice when starting wars to fake some attack of the enemy to be first. That is not what we are discussing, though.<p>Also, let's think the other way round. Naomi seems to claim that people don't want free markets because the evil power people have to force it on them. But could it not be the other way round, people would actually want them, and the evil power people are actually trying to prevent it? The ""evidence"" could be interpreted in both ways.<p>When did people voluntarily decide against free markets, anyway? Which communist regime did not turn into a dictatorship in no time? The only reason people might think they would prefer communism is because they don't really understand economics, and don't understand what it would mean for them.",1203858984

122459,comment,122287,122449,0,0,NSX2,,,">> As I said, of course politicians and power people are playing their game, and exploiting psychology is surely a part of it. I just don't see any connection to free markets, that is what I take issue with.<p>But she never says, ""Free markets are bad.""  She seems to be saying instead that many of the things we are told are ""democratic free market solutions"" are not because they are ""slipped in"" when people are in a state of shock and not thinking clearly.  So many ""free market solutions"" are not actually, according to her, even put to the test of a democratic free market but rather sneaked in when nobody's paying attention because they're too busy trying to survive a disaster.<p>>>You saw all that in a five minute video?<p>Yes.  She points to an influential man (Friedman) who advises corproations, the federal reserve and presidents, she points to a documented theory of his (shock precedes change because people are too weak to oppose the change), and she shows ""pictures"" as you say of events in recent history which fit into the following thesis:  disaster is exploited, and possibly caused (that's my inference, she never says that) by people who want to introduce changes that would never actually work in a real democratic free market system.<p>The pictures of the torture and the cia training manual excerpts are there to demonstrate that the state of mind of regression that happens after a shock is no accident and that the cia, a nexus between government and corporate america, has been interested in inducing this state on purpose for about half a century.<p>Fast forward to recent history and the film shows pictures of natural and artificially created disasters, then it indicates how governments and major corporations rushed to close deals right after the disaster while the people such deals would effect were too busy trying to survive the aftermath to figure out how they were getting screwed.<p>I think her main point is, not so much, ""the populist, democratic free market is bad"" but rather ""if the populist, democratic free market is good"" as friedman says it is, why then do friedman and the nexus between washington and corporate america rely so much not on the free market itself but rather disasters that suspend the free market?  Why are their ""free market solutions"" pushed through when the market is at it's worst after a disaster?  Could it be that their ideas would never pass muster in a free market?<p>IN OTHER WORDS, HER IMPORTANT POINT IS: A free market is a system where parties trade when both see a payoff benefit to the transaction.  If one party suggests something that is too exploitive,  in a free market the transaction would not happen.  BUT IF I TAKE A BAT AND SMACK YOUR HEAD AROUND and cause you to fear your very life, well then you'd pretty much sign anything I put in front of you.<p>That's not a free market system of rational people making decisions in their best interests.  That's a mafia system.  The 'ol ""Hello, I'm your new partner - you'll be sharing 80% of your profits with me because I says so.""",1203858921

122456,comment,122287,122447,0,0,NSX2,,,"Well, I don't think he ever EXPLICITLY stated that an effort should be made to ""push"" things into a state of crisis, he just EXPLICITLY said that a crisis should be exploited when people are emotional and irrational to push forward ""free market"" developments that, ironically, would never actually see the light of day in an actual, bona fide free market system.<p>Milton seemed to have a strange, incongruous view of life, namely, that democratic, free-market developments AS HE SAW FIT were the best thing for people at large, and such developments as he saw fit should be adopted by the people at large regardless of whether they actually want to adapt it.<p>His economic argument in ways mirrors bush's political doctrine of ""liberating"" iraq and ""spreading democracy"" through military force, whether people want it or not.<p>Same thing happened in Vietnam, where a ""free market system"" democratically chose to organize itself according to decentralized communist structures and washington flew in a fit of rage and assumed that no way a democratic free market would ever democratically vote anything other than what washington saw as proper, so there must be something wrong and so intervention was necessary.<p>Same thing happened when Palestinians were pressured into having democratic elections, they democratically elected Hamas, and washington declared the elections invalid simply because the outcome, left to a bona fide democratic free market process, turned out different than expected.<p>I think what you're saying is simply implied in her thesis, ie, if they explicitly state that crisis should be exploited to bypass natural populist resistance to ""free market solutions"" that would never be accepted in a bona fide free market, then economic theory would suggest that the prime actors behind these sub-par economic solutions would EVENTUALLY find it in their self-interest to either initiate the crisis or invest in other actors to do so by proxy.<p>But she never actually says this, it's just implied.<p>As for Milton Friedman's quote taken out of context, it actually isn't taken out of context at all.  He wrote TONS of op-ed pieces for the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, and they were almost all related to tragedies experience over the last decade or so.<p>South-Korean economy crash, BCCI scandal, dot-com crash, 9-11, war in Afghanistan, Palestinian conflict, war in Iraq, Asian tsunami, Katrina, etc.<p>He follows the same pattern predictably:  Horrible disaster, followed by his op-ed pieces, usually along these lines: ""This event (whatever) is a horrible, horrible tragedy and millions are suffering.  But it's also a wonderful new opportunity to try some ideas I've been trying to get adopted for years.""<p>The question is, why does he see tragedy as a wonderful new opportunity?  According to Klein, no suggestion is ever offered other than that after a tragedy, people are too week and child-like and desperate to offer resistance.<p>If this mechanism is prevalent (and she provides evidenct that it is, at least enough), then that leads us to conclude that most ""free market"" solutions are nothing of the sort and are instead centrally managed exploitations by people whose ideas would never actually be successful in a free market.<p>Now, to the extent that such people have had success in times of crisis, and to the extent that you think that it is in their interest to initiate crisis, well - that would be a plausible connection, but to the best of my knowledge she never explicitly states that.<p>But it's interesting to consider that you and I have both jumped to that scenario, ie, ""But wait a minute - that would mean that ...""<p>And we're not even beneficiaries of such a mechanism.<p>If we can think that, isn't it plausible that people who have hundreds of billions of dollars at stake might think that also?<p>No?  Why not?  Because the super rich and politically powerful are all wonderful, ethical people who have our best interests in mind and they would never stoop so low as to prosper at the expense of those economically and politically weaker than they are?<p>Please.",1203858017

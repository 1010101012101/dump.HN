Search actually seems a lot like the food industry in that you can't really judge the quality of the product beyond a certain level, yet you care deeply about that quality.  Those industries usually tend to become branding plays, not technology plays.",1222369172

Searched for ""Epigram"" first and it came up with the programming language as the first result, along with Conor's homepage.  Searched for ""Arya Stark"" and it came up with the Westeros fan wiki and Wikipedia entry.  Searched for Hacker News, and the site was the first hit.  Searched for my name (a tough one, since lots of people share it), and came up with my FriendFeed page, Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours, and a support question I left on the webfaction forum.<p>Couple comments:<p>What's with the Wink and PeopleFinder links?  Partnerships?  They're almost never what I want, and putting them up top is distracting.<p>The AJAX-load-more-results-on-scroll feature is cool, but I found it a little jerky and distracting.  This could be because just hold down the down arrow, so I go <i>really</i> fast and often hit the end of the page while it's loading.  Any way to make the transition a little smoother, maybe by preloading results and only displaying them as you scroll, maybe by a fade or slide transition?",1222368933

315219,comment,314294,314294,0,0,thomasmallen,,,"I've been using Macs my whole computing life, and I thought of them as Good until the first iPod worked with Windows. ""But that's just business,"" you say, but in fact that represented a huge shift for Apple, and I recognized it immediately: Taking care of Mac customers was no longer Apple's chief concern, nor was creating great computers. Profit was the new obsession at company built by obsessions.<p>I watched 2002's July Keynote (MacWorld) from my local, brand-spankin'-new Apple store, and only a handful of us [all Mac geeks in attendance] were excited about the iPod. We came to see about OSX 10.1, and whatever cool software Apple might be brewing up, and this threw us for a loop.<p>Then next-gen iPods were available for Windows. Then I couldn't use FireWire with new iPods, even to charge them! And things have really deteriorated for us old-school MacAddicts since then. For one, MacAddict became MacLife (lame). Jobs killed off the ""Sad Mac"" and took all of the color and life out of the company. OSX 10.0-3 were great, 10.4 was OK, and Leopard is a goddamn trainwreck, relatively speaking.<p>From that point on, it was all about the Benjamins in Cupertino. I was disgusted that Apple would so quickly switch to Intel processors after years of persuading us (proving, in my opinion) that PowerPC was the superior architecture. Having followed Apple for quite some time, I predicted back then that Apple would eventually just sell software, iPods, and other gizmos: Moving away from PowerPC would be the death-knell for Mac-exclusive software (specifically catering to Mac users), be it at the hands of Apple or Psystar. I could care less.",1222368838

292989,comment,292856,292856,0,0,rcoder,,,"I think the take-away from this article isn't that you should absolutely use the 4-1/2 day workweek model at your firm; instead, I read it to say that they had experimented with several different schedules, put some serious thought into what worked and what didn't, and then implemented a solution which was tailored to <i>their</i> team, deployment schedule, and customer base.<p>If you want something which works as well in your business, don't just mindlessly clone this, or the 37signals 4-day week, or the first-stage startup 80-hour deathmarch, or <i>any</i> existing schedule -- work it out for your own environment.<p>Personally, I've been doing a lot of tweaking of my own schedule at work over the last year, and found that having at least one full day a week where work from home is a big booster to my productivity. It's an entire day where I can avoid random interruptions, and I <i>never</i> have that meeting in the middle of the morning that basically wastes the day through lunchtime.",1220381541
292987,comment,292958,292958,0,0,tstegart,,,"I write notes, which I generally consider my plan. It never ends up as a full fledged, fully written plan though. But I feel like I need to cover the basics, like who I would market to, how I would make money, some general estimates on how much money the idea could make, what the costs will be, how much capital it will require, that sort of thing.<p>I found too many times I got excited about an idea only to later realize it was completely stupid and had no possible chance of making money. I have too many ideas in my head, so  writing notes is part of the vetting process. If I can't figure out who would buy or, why and for how much, and if that will be enough in comparison to how much I would need to spend, then its not worth spending more of my time on.<p>I think business plans or notes need to be written, because you come up with ideas and strategies and find problems you would never have thought of. I think its even more important when you're selling an actual physical product or service, because capital is so intensive.<p>I think PG's advice is really for experimental entrepreneurship, where its labor intensive but not necessarily capital intensive, very much like many web 2.0 companies these days. If you're planning on building a widget that will cost $100 to make and sell for $200, you'd better be damned sure you know who might buy it, who would sell it, and when you'll start turning a profit. A good plan can be a process to tell you how those things will happen.",1220381513
292986,comment,292927,292927,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My preferred programmers grep: <a href=""http://petdance.com/ack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://petdance.com/ack/</a><p>Though rkern is a very clever fellow, and I'm sure grin is sufficiently awesome.  I think I'll benchmark the two...I kinda suspect ack is faster, but maybe Python will surprise me (when I used to work in Python a few years ago, I was occasionally disappointed in its performance for tasks like this).<p>Interestingly, grin uses the exact same output format as ack...same colors and all.<p>And, yep, ack is quite a bit faster:<p><pre><code>    $ time ack joe
    real    0m1.708s
    user    0m1.308s
    sys     0m0.348s

    $ time grin -d .svn joe
    real    0m6.066s
    user    0m5.191s
    sys     0m0.802s
</code></pre>
Looks like grin is trying to deal with things that ack doesn't (binary files, for example), so perhaps that's a factor.<p>And, of course, grep (when massaged appropriately to make it only search the bits we really want) is faster still:<p><pre><code>    $ time find * -name '.svn' -prune -o -type f -exec grep joe \{\} +
    real    0m0.412s
    user    0m0.149s
    sys     0m0.189s
</code></pre>
So, theoretically, one could wrap that up in an alias, but ack is sufficiently fast, and does enough other cool tricks that I'll just stick with it.",1220381489

292977,story,,,31,0,justin,"Justin.TV is hiring engineers",,"Here's what you need to know about JTV:<p>- We are the largest live video site in a rapidly growing market. If you want to check them out, some of our competitors in this space are ustream.tv, livevideo.com, stickam.com, mogulus.com, live.yahoo.com and kyte.tv - more spring up almost every day to keep us on our toes.<p>- We are growing very quickly. Here's a graph of our daily pageviews since last October, when we opened up JTV to anyone who wanted to broadcast:
<a href=""http://abstractnonsense.com/justintv-daily-pageviews-october-2007-to-september-2008.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abstractnonsense.com/justintv-daily-pageviews-october...</a>
Our Alexa graph shows a similar story over roughly the same period of time:
<a href=""http://abstractnonsense.com/justintv-alexa-2-september-2008.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abstractnonsense.com/justintv-alexa-2-september-2008....</a>
We have over 1.5 million registered users, and our doubling period is roughly 2.5 months.<p>- Not all the hard problems are solved, and not all the equity is gone. In fact we are dealing with some of the most challenging problems any of us have come across. The scale and speed of our growth force us to experiment with techniques and technologies only the very biggest websites ever need to use. Sometimes we find something other people have pioneered, and adapt it to fit JTV. Other times we're the pioneers, inventing new scaling solutions that we haven't seen anyone else using yet.<p>- We treat ourselves well. Everyone sits down to a free catered lunch together on week-days. We have a great company health plan that includes dental-care. We subsidize gym memberships and commuting costs. Our office is comfortable, naturally well-lit, and one block from SF Caltrain. You can see it here: <a href=""http://www.justin.tv/officecam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/officecam</a><p>- Despite treating ourselves well, we're frugal where it counts. We're working our way towards profitability quite quickly.<p>- The people here are smart, friendly and driven. We have MIT dropouts, robot-builders, and PhDs. We come from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. You'll find us very welcoming, and you'll definitely learn a lot from the people around you.<p>Here's what we need to know about you:<p>- You know a bunch of different languages, and you're comfortable learning new ones quickly. You have strong opinions on what makes a language good, but at the end of the day you're a pragmatist and you'll use whatever it takes to get the job done.<p>- You know Linux. You wouldn't be uncomfortable if someone suggested you spend a few hours digging around /proc to see if you can squeeze a bit more performance out of the tcp stack.<p>- You know how the web works, at least from HTTP to HTML. You probably need to look up the details, but you know if you needed to, you could figure out everything from cache-control headers to why something isn't rendering properly (in Firefox at least. Only masochists know why things aren't rendering properly in IE6).<p>- You are available to work in San Francisco.<p>If you think you're a good fit, and you're excited about JTV, please contact us (jobs@justin.tv) with your answer to one of these problems: <a href=""http://www.justin.tv/problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/problems</a>",1220381198

The replacement I wrote ran each query in about 100ms.  The hard part was in getting my data structures good enough that the whole dataset could fit in 3GB (that's how much memory was in the server I was using).",1176997834

14636,comment,14586,14632,0,0,zaidf,,,"I know several first time entrepreneurs from several years ago that ""tested"" waters in initial stages trying to raise VC money. And it's damn hard! So unless this guy has some inside connections and has been there, done that--I'd personally say it is not only a bad idea but potentially a huge waste of time--same thought I'm sure you must be having.<p>If you can get going without any funding(which it appears you can) START. Yet if this guy insists on getting funding before ANYTHING else, he might just be an excuser or nonbeliever hoping the funding will validate his idea. Both bad things in a cofounder of a company that isn't even in development yet.<p>I'll leave some room because obviously you know more than I do about this specific guy and your situation. But if I had a cofounder who INSISTED on raising VC, he would have to be DAMN GOOD seller for me to buy into it--and chances are, we would still part ways as far as working together on that specific venture.",1176997158

14632,comment,14586,14625,0,0,anon,,,"To answer a few questions:<p>One of my issues with this person is that while I do like his company, and respect him in a lot of ways, we think differently about how to move things forward.  I'm much more of a ""below the radar, live cheap and get something working"" guy, whereas he's more along the lines of ""VC funding or bust"", without even having much of a prototype.  That just sounds bad to me.  Though I recognize that funding at a later stage in the game would certainly help, I think we'll have a better bargaining position if we have something that sort of works in hand.<p>That's another thing... I believe more in having mostly technical people.  Different skill sets can certainly be a good thing (the Paypal story in Founders at Work was a good example), but it's also a good way to start thinking ""hrm... I'm building the code... what is that other guy actually doing?"" <p>Juwo: I'm not planning on stealing the idea or anything like that.  I have plenty of ideas of my own.  The one he's hatched up is pretty good, but it's not going anywhere in terms of code or a web site or stuff like that.  Just paperwork for investors...",1176996505

14625,comment,14586,14586,0,0,zaidf,,,"I am sure this is just one way but from all the times I remember having a great experience working with someone else, it just happened without me analyzing beforehand bullet by bullet how good the guy is. And I do have couple instances where the paper analysis of the guy was great but once we started work it wasn't so great.<p>My experience is that if you aren't deep into a stage where you HAVE to give away a cofounder title, just start working with the guy! When we associate the cofounder title it carries the stereotypical image of a cofounder which makes us double guess if this guy is ""co founder material""--but there is no such thing as ""cofounder material."" <p>All you have are people passionate and skillful enough to help you start and execute your venture and people that aren't. Before thinking of someone as a ""cofounder"" think if he can practically help you with a skill you need that you yourself lack or aren't best at. ",1176995175

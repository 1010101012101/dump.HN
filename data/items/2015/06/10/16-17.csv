However, it is absolutely possible to get jobs in places where your ratio of cost of living to salary is better than it is in Dublin, even before you factor in how much more you would take home before you end up paying the nuts VAT rates, PAYE, PRSI, USC charges that push you into almost 53% tax at 32k euro. I moved to Edinburgh when I graduated, and forgetting about my salary, my rent is a good 300 euro less a month, my transport bills are lower, I live in a nicer flat than I did before, and general costs of living are lower than they were in Dublin. I have more disposable income than I would have had on the same salary, and the ballpark offers that I have received here are the same as, if not better than home.<p>The reddit thread in [1] has plenty of people who came out at over 80k euro starting salaries.

When I left for college I had amassed a large suitcase full of bricks. One of my best friends in HS had a significantly younger brother that was the coolest little kid I knew. I gave him my suitcase. He was so happy. I think I quadrupled his collection. It felt good then and it still feels good now when I think of how happy little Elwood was. But now as an adult with kids of my own, I kick myself a little bit for not seeing the future. What I would give to go back and tell 18yr old me to hang on to those sets.

The trampoline exploit allowed the malware to bypass digital signature requirements designed to prevent the loading of malicious code into the OS kernel space.<p>>&quot;What is really impressive here—what I call really amazing—is the entire malware platform depends on this zero-day to work,&quot; Raiu said. &quot;So if there is no zero day to jump into kernel mode this doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;<p>Now this will be patched, and they will need something completely different for the next framework.",1433955020

9693550,comment,9692501,9692501,0,0,ddingus,,,"This seems a fair critique to me, in that the clash between fashion and tech / geek / gadgets is real.  For some people, blending all of that will make sense.  I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for enough people for the watch to mainstream like the phones have.<p>Take some of the commentary below as just my own idle thoughts, fantasy as to what might actually make sense.  We aren&#x27;t there yet, but we are close to taking some steps...<p>For me personally, it&#x27;s compelling as an advance in what a watch can do.  Of course, I was the geek back when I wore watches too.  Had multi-function ones, and the best features were solar, with sensor to display light level (rare Seiko), and the variety of increment timers, alarms, and such.  Had a calculator one for a while too.  Used it a lot.<p>Some of those have aged well.  I&#x27;ve an old Seiko that just screams &quot;80&#x27;s era peak digital tech&quot;, and it&#x27;s beautiful.  Machined case, reasonable display, nice band, etc...  Once in a while, I&#x27;ll wear it for fashion today.  I no longer care about the functionality.<p>When I got past the simple pager and decided to carry a phone, I realized I don&#x27;t like a lot of personal tech dependency.  Having a phone and a watch, along with other potential things to carry around was too much.  Something had to go, and that thing was the watch.<p>I&#x27;ve also realized the real appeal of wearables to me would be some sort of other interface, sci-fi at present (I think), where I can interact without looking at the thing somehow.  It having a display is nice, but as a primary use case, not attractive to me anymore.  I&#x27;ve a phone for that, and my Note 4 is a powerful phone!  There are days when it&#x27;s my only computing device, and I&#x27;m very happy about that development.<p>Someday, when the wearable can interact on a more personal level, say by stimulating nerves, or doing some other kind of thing, I see the potential for that private comms channel being really useful.  Maybe meet somebody, query the phone for some info, get it, and all the while being able to engage them personally without having to pull out some tech, or interact with a thing they can see. Or maybe, it can notify me when somebody I really need / want to interact with enters the room, or is present via some other means.  Maybe I could just quietly ask for help too, a 911 call without announcing it&#x27;s been made.<p>To me, that&#x27;s where wearable needs to go; otherwise, why not just have it on the phone where every other thing is?<p>Long ago, I learned morse code for a HAM radio license.  Honestly, if I could get a wearable that would pulse to me at some reasonable rate, and I could pulse back at some reasonable rate, it would be enough to be super useful with the right software.  Think text / command line type interface, with some data ending up on the display for various reasons too.  Yes, this idea is primitive, and not something most ordinary people would find appealing, but I can&#x27;t shake it due to my own experiences.<p>For people who have mastered morse, they can take it in nearly any form.  Blinking lights, sound, vibration, taps on the shoulder, whatever.  It just works, and they get 30-60 words per minute doing that.  I&#x27;ve been around these people, say at a camp fire or some other event, and they literally are following a conversation via a blinking light nobody else there is aware of.  I got a sense of what it would be like to be deaf, and found that potential compelling.  The idea of having a comms channel with a device like that, personal, private, non intrusive to other interactions is where things become part of us, not just some thing mounted for handy interaction.<p>Using a watch still takes my sight, and sometimes my sound, and my hands.  Using a watch with voice interaction is cool in some contexts, like when I&#x27;m using my hands, but not so cool in a social context, where using hands can work because one is speaking, etc...  It&#x27;s all a distraction, or rude, or public.  Besides, a phone can do that stuff now.<p>And in that sense, forget the wrist!  Just gimme something I can interact with on a more basic level, and I&#x27;ll gladly learn that technique just as I did code, and would use it frequently enough to be worth the bother...  or more realistically, the implant or whatever it takes to make it happen.<p>On that note, a friend has the little magnet implanted in their finger.  It was done in a bio-compatable way, and they&#x27;ve had it for a long time.  You can simulate this by wrapping a small, strong magnet in tape around a finger, or some other part of the body.  It only takes a little while for your body to self-identify with this new thing, and it becomes a sense quickly.  Feeling fields, invokes visuals much like thinking about things does.  The minds eye opens up a little.  This experience was compelling enough to make me very seriously consider getting one.  No joke.<p>Say that magnet was in the wrist, or near it, just as a point of discussion for how intimate tech could work?<p>Now, that watch can communicate a lot of things, and do so quickly.  Vibrate, pulse, low frequency, high frequency...  those all become distinct, easily differentiated things quickly.  Of course, it&#x27;s mostly one way, unless it were near a muscle, or the watch could pick up signals for fingers, or some other basic movement...  Pulse it in specific ways, and directions / vectors can be communicated too, due to the small motion of the magnet, and how one&#x27;s mind tends to map that sense point in space and with relation to the body.  Think Google navigation with no visuals.  Just walk around, and get the nav data streamed a piece at a time.  Turn left, go faster, turn right, look one way, look the other, as it gets closer, pulse stronger, etc...  I would use something like that near constantly.<p>That&#x27;s where this stuff needs to go IMHO, and we just aren&#x27;t there quite yet.  Just having a spiffy touch gadget on a wrist really isn&#x27;t all that compelling to me, given I&#x27;ve got one that is more powerful, easier to interact with and higher throughput comms wise in my pocket, that I can set on a table, share with friends, and so forth.  Perhaps it makes really great sense to pour more R&D into the watch / skin interface.  People can learn a lot and adapt quickly.  Maybe a light zap, or a grid of things that can zap might be expressive enough to be useful.  Now that I write this, I&#x27;m seriously tempted to make something and try exploring what can be triggered with a simple metal to skin interface....  and what can be sensed too.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong either.  The tech in the watch is clever, and I&#x27;m very seriously impressed with what Apple has done in terms of packing power into small places.  Damn cool.  Just not useful enough to commit to wearing.<p>Plus, it&#x27;s just another thing to recharge.  I&#x27;ve already got a computer and a phone to manage...",1433954959

Stream parallelization is used not just to speed things up but as an easier way to write massively parallel programs.<p>Instead of bug inducing mutexes and semaphores, you write a series of threads who are only able to communicate between themselves through streams. Each thread possesses input streams to receive data from other threads and output streams to talk to other threads. Each thread is idle until it receives an input from one of the streams. It then performs some processing which can include sending messages to output streams before going back to sleep. A system may possess a large number of threads and<p>I wrote a pacman this way where interactive object was a thread: the pacman, ghosts, bonuses,... Even the score was in its own thread.

Taking medication to allow yourself to continue doing something unnatural, which you don&#x27;t even like, has to be the one of the most dehumanizing things I can think of. That&#x27;s modern day, self-induced slavery if you ask me.<p>And yes, I have experience with this. In college, I met with a psychiatrist about depression-related symptoms. I described my life circumstances (school, work, relationship, etc), and after just one 45-minute session he prescribed me SSRIs. They did nothing, except creates horrific withdrawals as I started coming off them. Then I made the real changes: I ended my toxic relationship, quit my cubicle job, and used my savings to have an enjoyable life for about a year. Then I finished school.<p>The OP seems to have had a pretty sweet set-up (remote, high-paying job, etc) but misery is still misery. Another comment mentioned burn-out. In my experience burn-out rarely has to do with the volume of work, but rather the mental anguish experienced. I&#x27;ve been burned out working 9 to 5; and energized beyond belief working 12 hour days on my own business.<p>Here&#x27;s some advice worth considering for those in similar situations. Quit your job, or figure out how to go part time. Your company won&#x27;t mind, you&#x27;re quite replaceable most likely. Really cut down on your expenses; get roommates if you have to (this can be more than a financial improvement -- socializing and having good friends improves your quality of life).<p>And my god, quit consumer culture. That thing you think you need to buy with your next paycheck? You probably don&#x27;t. What you need is: a roof over your head, food, laptop/phone, and a gym membership. What&#x27;s the grand total of all this, maybe $1K/mo? (Depends where you live I suppose.) I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re a single mid-late 20s male if you&#x27;re reading this. What else would do you <i>really</i> need to be happy and spend your time working on your own tech projects?<p>Best of luck to the OP and anyone else doing something similar.",1433954079

In it you can see that they took a lot of &quot;time twins&quot; (people born within a small time window on the order of hours or minutes) and measure if astrology had any predictive power over their lives. Spoiler: no, not really. Just a couple of quotes:<p>&quot;The spacing of human births in a large population is described by a Poisson distribution, which shows that every year in a city of one million people about 4,000 pairs of time twins are born 5 minutes apart or less.&quot;<p>&quot;Unlike the Roberts and Greengrass approach (count each time twin against every other time twin within one day, which would have produced nearly 600,000 pairs), serial correlation counts each time twin once only, thus minimizing the risk of artifacts. So the test conditions could hardly have been more conducive to success. But the results are uniformly negative, see Table 2. The effect size due to astrology is 0.00 ± 0.03.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/Dean.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/Dean.pdf</a>",1433954068

Statistics come from actual data, so shortcomings in the data collection can produce shortcomings in the statistics.<p>For example the testing that goes into IQ is not without controversy. And crime statistics are directly dependent on the policing and prosecution of crime--they don&#x27;t reflect the objective reality of crime, they reflect the outcomes of an imperfect system that detects and punishes crime.<p>There is ample and growing evidence that many such systems are significantly biased by racism. See: the recent Justice Department investigations of municipal police deparments like Ferguson, Cleveland, etc. So judging the criminality of a particular &quot;race&quot; by aggregate police statistics is not likely to be objective.<p>Finally, the concept of race itself is socially constructed, and therefore not objective. If a person has a white mother and a black father, are they black or white? What if one grandparent is Asian? Ultimately the attribution of race is a human social decision--a person self-identifies with a particular race, and/or others define their race based on how they look.

The higher the IQ, the more likely you are to see some issue of that sort. That is something you should be able to easily verify with a quick search. If you can&#x27;t, I can suggest some sources. (I am on a tablet ATM. Providing links would be a pain.)<p>Some years ago, I was contacted by a woman who had been brutally raped in her teens. She had dissociated during the rape. She felt really bad about that and, over the years, mental health professionals and others had given her messages and attitudes that just reinforced her negative feeling. I told her that it only proved that something was done to her that was really terrible and, unable to physically escape, she did the only thing she could do to protect her mind. I suggested to her that fragmenting some piece of your mind puts it on ice so you have hope of retrieving it later. It isn&#x27;t lost. You prevent it from being outright destroyed by what you are enduring. So I suspect it probably helps to have a high IQ so you can create complex internal structures if you are in a sufficiently hostile setting, and then the result can be multiple &quot;faces&quot; developing.

Recently she presented a similar talk (or the same one? I haven&#x27;t watched the full TED talk yet.) at the 99u Conference in NYC, in which she made the point: &quot;You can use that stress not as a signal that there’s something wrong with you...but to actually use that same stress as a sign that something you care about is at stake. Take that stress as an opportunity to think about what you care about, to view the situation as an opportunity to learn and grow, to trust you can handle the challenge.&quot;",1433952079

Process is orthogonal to that.<p>In a top-down management style, your so-called &quot;Lead Developer&quot; is just the first head on the chopping block. They&#x27;re leaders of puppet regimes. If the real leaders don&#x27;t like them, they install a new one. It comes in many forms: layoffs, &quot;performance&quot; related dismissal (&quot;you&#x27;re not getting enough done!&quot; because of all the rejected requirements docs), even reassignment to &quot;re-engineering initiatives&quot; that have no real chance of seeing the light of day.<p>Finding a management infrastructure that actually cares about feedback is incredibly rare.

The date on which a child is born will influence the environment in which they spend the early months of their lives – levels of sunlight exposure, temperature, allergens, pesticides and so on, both for the child and the mother. Given that, and knowledge that exposure to certain environments and chemicals can change the risk of health conditions later in life, it&#x27;s hardly a big leap to demonstrate that correlation through a larger population-scale study.<p>I&#x27;d be far more surprised if there were <i>no</i> link!",1433952005

""As a hypothetical example, take the University of Pennsylvania and Penn State, which are two schools a lot of students choose between,"" Krueger said. ""One is Ivy, one is a state school. Penn is much more highly selective. If you compare the students who go to those two schools, the ones who go to Penn have higher incomes. But let's look at those who got into both types of schools, some of whom chose Penn and some of whom chose Penn State. Within that set it doesn't seem to matter whether you go to the more selective school. Now, you would think that the more ambitious student is the one who would choose to go to Penn, and the ones choosing to go to Penn State might be a little less confident in their abilities or have a little lower family income, and both of those factors would point to people doing worse later on. But they don't.""<p>The moral of the story is that if you're a hard working individual, connections and money are going to follow regardless of where you go to school.",1193943506

Some of the top layer changes in elections, but it seems like the bad guys in the government have very long careers, alternating between government appointments and jobs in companies closely tied to the government.  Cheney is a famous example, but there are thousands more like him.<p>The culture in this world seems to be quite different from that of startup hubs.  These people are suits squared.  They fail a lot, but not because they try wildly imaginative things. They fail because succeeding (as we'd measure it) is not their goal; power is.",1193943308

My girlfriend does a Phd in relationship therapy and she says that it is interesting to her because it has both and emotional component and an analytical component. For me anything to do with emotions is a no no. Women are into those areas because they need something more than what the hard sciences has to offer not because they have less to bring to the table.",1193943237

But BigPapa Stearns only hires Harvard grads because no one was ever fired for hiring Harvard grads.<p>In the end, if you don't make your life an empty pursuit for the almighty dollar that consumes 16 hours of your days for a good 3 or 4 years before succumbing to that coke addiction and none of this would matter.

75130,comment,75076,75076,0,0,queensnake,,,"I can vouch for Miro (formerly Democracy Player) - the content it starts you out with isn't that good and I had never previously bothered with it, but there's a decent amount of good stuff in the channel guide. Eg Nova, Frontline, several others. These aren't the full shows, but shorter segments. Because the seasons are fixed-length you get a bonanza at the beginning which runs out, but you can still use Miro as a podcast player (and queue up those Google.edus you've been meaning to watch), which is nice. Unfortunately Miro doesn't accept audio-only channels into their guide, but you can set up your own just fine. ",1193941946

75127,comment,75069,75119,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Please. Tell us what you really feel. Stop holding back so much. :)<p>I know it's fun to lob rhetorical hand grenades around. The nice thing about the US is that we have a system where failure is accepted. If you don't like the policies or leaders, there will always be someone along later that's more to your liking.  We've done all kinds of screwed up stuff -- and all kinds of good stuff. I think it's absolutely important to point out where we're wrong, but a little perspective can be useful too. <p>In my perfect world there would be a lot less government involvement in all of our lives. We would be armed and take care of things like terrorism ourselves right when it happened, instead of farming the responsibility for our security out to big government. But both the left and the right want to take away all of our freedoms and do all the worrying and thinking for us.  So that means we turn what should be personal things like health care, personal security, property ownership, and privacy into a huge multi-generational political argument without resolution. And then people complain that the government gets it wrong!   I think people are all too happy to take away somebody else's freedom for their pet cause. It's just when somebody else does it to them that they squeal the most. That's why I can only answer what freedoms I am personally willing to trade in the war on terror. I can't and won't make those decisions for other people.<p>I can make one observation, though. As democracies are attacked by terrorism they have a tendency to get more and more restrictive. I would expect the US to follow that pattern -- it has in the past. The thing I am watching is whether those restrictions are temporary or permanent.<p>I don't countenance too much the argument that politicians use fear to keep the war on terror machine humming along. To me that sounds a lot more paranoid than just simply acknowledging that there are people right now who are actively plotting to kill lots of Americans. It's nothing to go beserko about, just something to consider when you make decisions to vote for representatives. If attacks continue over the next few decades, voters will punish politicians who downplay the threat of terrorism. That's just political reality.",1193941354
75126,story,,,29,26,Zak,"Scheme in the real world",,"Is anybody here using Scheme in the real world? Common Lisp has been my language of choice for a while now, but I'd like to try something a little less bulky.  There are two types of projects I'm working on with very different requirements. I'm considering Scheme for both.<p>The first is standard webapp development. I've been using Hunchentoot, CL-WHO and friends here, and I'm experimenting with Weblocks. I generally like these tools, but I'm open to trying tools that work differently. I'd like to know what tools the Scheme users here prefer for web work.<p>The other project is a desktop/embedded (fairly fast PC hardware) system with soft real-time requirements (for the curious, it's a DMX lighting controller). I'm looking for speed, multithreading and some predictability in the garbage collector.",1193941199
75125,comment,75063,75063,0,0,caveman82,,,"The problem with the classic argument of ""whether or not it is worth paying a hefty premium to go to an elite school"" is that it discounts the impact of intangibles, such as positive peer influence and brand value.  <p>I say yes.  The effect is even more pronounced in highly competitive industries like finance. I've found that an overwhelming majority of successful recent grads in that industry (2-3 yr exp analysts making $300,000+/year) are top 20 grads.  I doubt the average 18-22 yr old is going to exhaust the knowledge that their professor can impart, but you put an above average student at a school where he's rubbing shoulders with future entrepreneurs, politicians and thought leaders there's no doubt that it will increase his likelihood of success.  <p>So back to the question: Is it worth paying $200,000(over 4 years at Skull and Bones College over paying $10000 at Big State U? In many circumstances, yes.<p>And yes--there are always exceptions to this rule but the discussion is about the overall trend not particular instances.  ",1193940950

75121,comment,75063,75088,0,0,neilc,,,"I don't think anyone ""needs"" to graduate from a top college. But I think it's also true that the quality of the engineering education at, say, MIT is much better than the quality of the education at an average university. Part of that is the quality of the lectures and lecturers, but another major factor is the environment -- the quality of your fellow students, and the social norms in a place like that.<p>I think that is even <i>more</i> so for graduate programs, but significantly less so for degrees in arts or the social sciences -- if you're taking poli sci, I think most of the advantage of going to Harvard is in the social connections you can make.",1193940096

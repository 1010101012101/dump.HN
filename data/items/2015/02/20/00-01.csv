I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get rid of the weather app I accidentally tapped, for instance. (Which is something I have no need for. Also: what the hell would I use a touch-screen for when I have a keyboard and mouse? EVERY windows machine I looked at had a touch-screen -- a feature I absolutely did not want.)<p>Long story short: I bought a MacBook. I would never have considered using an Apple product if Windows 8 hadn&#x27;t been so frustrating to try to use.<p>Yes, I <i>could</i> have learned to use Windows 8. But if I am going to learn something new, I&#x27;m going to try to select smartly from all the systems available, and Windows is only a small part of that. In other words, Windows 8 forced me to make a decision that I wouldn&#x27;t have even made if those computers had Windows 7 on them. If they had Windows 7, I would have just bought one and got to work.<p>I suppose I can thank MS for my newfound love of Linux.

Expressing distaste for memory-managed languages in game development and being able to cite a specific scenario for that is not the same as saying that memory-managed languages are all just bad. I think you, the author and anybody with a modicum of technical maturity can agree that &quot;fast&quot; memory-managed languages are not at an absolute global optimum because they make specific tradeoffs that not everyone will always want to make. Granting this, if we have even one reason to still keep around a memory-managed language (and that&#x27;s not hard to come up with) then we have a case for keeping multiple languages around and being able to interface among them.<p>Not everybody realizes this; especially among people who argue about programming languages on web forums, there are still a large number who are still married to the idea that one language has to do everything and if any language has any weakness, we should leave it alone as &quot;bad&quot; because its flaws mean that it is not the Miss Universe of programming languages.

All your documentation, such as it is, describes things using terms that you never actually define or explain. Your code is just as bad. Worse in fact, because it introduces yet further terms that are not in the documentation.<p>Your Conflict-Resolution-with-Guns page simply says &#x27;see gun.HAM&#x27; for the explanation. No indication where this can be found. It isn&#x27;t in the source repository and it isn&#x27;t in the wiki. A google search reveals nothing.<p>The &#x27;algorithm&#x27; presented on How-to-Create-GUN is meaningless because you don&#x27;t define any of the return values. I can see how it maps some input values to some output values, but nowhere do you say what any of those return values actually mean, what I should do with them, or why they are useful.<p>e.g. return {amnesiaQuarantine: true} ... what does this mean? What should be done with that return value? What is an amnesiaQuarantine?<p>e.g. return {quarantineState: true} ... what does this mean? How does it differ from amnesiaQuarantine: true? What is a quarantineState? How should I react to receiving this return value?<p>Your documentation says a lot, but doesn&#x27;t actually define anything, and is ultimately meaningless. This is why people are giving you a hard time and asking so many questions.<p>Most people reading will not know: what amnesiaQuarantine is, what amnesiState is, what the Hypothetical Amnesia Machine thought experiment is, what a boundary function is (there are multiple definitions - what are you using?), what &#x27;converge: true means&#x27;, what &#x27;incoming: true&#x27; means, what state: true means (given that you say other &#x27;<i>state&#x27; variables are </i>times* -- how the hell does a boolean represent a time, what &#x27;you have not properly handled recursion through your data&#x27; means. What is a &#x27;soul&#x27;? What happens to the data when particular values are stored? Where are things stored? What is the data flow? How are things shared? How does sync happen?<p>Imagine you don&#x27;t know what any of your terminology means - like everybody reading your documentation. Treat each term like an undefined variable. Now try to understand your document. You can&#x27;t. Those undefine terms are never &#x27;set&#x27; anywhere. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense. As soon as it gets close to actually explaining anything it just handwaves, or leaves you with undefined terminology.<p>You don&#x27;t define what kind of persistence you implement or what consistency guarantees (worse: your explanations do not seem consistent). You don&#x27;t define how your conflict resolution works (the &#x27;explanation&#x27; given is tantamount to Star Trek technobabble). You don&#x27;t define how data is transferred. Your slides are useless without any notes.<p>In your code you say that ACID is vague. It really isn&#x27;t. Your explanation of how you meet ACID <i>is</i> extremely vague however, using what appear to be truisms and contradictions, and yet more undefined terms that seem to have little to do with anything mentioned in the documentation. Your code is poorly structured, and badly commented. It uses &#x27;cool&#x27; sounding gun-related terminology (&#x27;shot&#x27;, &#x27;roulette&#x27;, etc.) without defining what the hell those things mean. There is nothing in the code that actually seems to do anything with consistency<p>Your HAM algorithm - the very crux of your system as stated in your documentation, remains unexplained, and WORSE.. has a TODO: comment noting that it might not work and needs further investigation. This comment also mentions rollbacks.... yet nowhere else in the code or documentation says anything about rollbacks, and it&#x27;s not clear why rollbacks would even be needed according to the (vague) explanation of HAM.<p>Your further explanations in these comments STILL do not actually describe precisely what HAM is or how it works. If you cannot do this in a simple and elegant manner, then NOBODY will be able to use or trust your database system.<p>If you want anybody to take you seriously, you must write a simple and concise explanation of HAM, including definitions of all your terms.<p>Frankly, it is so vague, and so unclear how it works that I am starting to think this is the product of some kind of mental illness...<p>Sorry to be so harsh, but nobody seems to be getting through to you.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m reminded of Einstein&#x27;s quote: &quot;If you can&#x27;t explain it simply, you don&#x27;t understand it well enough.&quot;",1424393342

Only when an object is cast to an interface type is a vtable generated and passed along with the object pointer in a <i>fat pointer</i>.<p>However, instead of just structuring the vtable as an array of pointers to methods (ordered e.g. by name), Loci instead generates a hashtable with method resolution stubs in case of conflicts. I don&#x27;t understand why - since the target interface&#x27;s type (and methods) are known at compile-time, it would be just as easy to fix the ordering of the methods and use the array approach (like in C++), instead of using a hashtable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://loci-lang.org/DynamicDispatch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loci-lang.org/DynamicDispatch.html</a>",1424393247

It makes it possible to write functional style code which is compiled into a loop for efficiency. For example:<p><pre><code>  (defun integers ()\n    &quot;Returns a series of all of the integers.&quot;\n    (declare (optimizable-series-function))\n    (scan-range :from 1))\n\n  (defun squares ()\n    &quot;Returns a series of all of the square numbers.&quot;\n    (declare (optimizable-series-function))\n    (map-fn t \n            (lambda (x) (* x x)) \n            (integers)))\n\n  (defun sum-squares (n)\n    &quot;Returns the sum of the first N square numbers.&quot;\n    (collect-sum (subseries (squares) 0 k)))\n</code></pre>\nAlthough the above definition of sum-squares seems like it would be inefficient, it is roughly the same as the following:<p><pre><code>  (defun sum-squares (n)\n    &quot;Returns the sum of the first N square numbers.&quot;\n    (loop for i from 1 to n\n          for square = (* i i)\n          sum square))\n</code></pre>\nI find it pretty awesome that it is possible to write code that is efficient and functional like that, but I guess series is a bit too magical to be put to actual use.<p>[0] <a href=""http://series.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://series.sourceforge.net/</a>",1424391907

9078124,comment,9077391,9078013,0,0,mlitchard,,,"First, when I say education, I mean Liberal Arts education. In this, I would include the humanities, and pure maths. The difference could be found in the approach to technical skills. For example, when I was a student of Attic Greek, our teacher liked to point out that our technical mastery of English grammar would serve us well if we chose a career in publishing. The acquiring of this technical skill was a side-effect of our pursuit, the study of Attic Greek, not the point of it. In vocational training, the entire point is in the acquiring of technical skill. I believe this is as important, and must be a separate pursuit so that it gets the resources it needs. A STEM example would be the difference between how engineering is treated in Canada, versus the  U.S. After an education of engineering theory, a student in Canada is then qualified to enter into an apprenticeship where they then have the opportunity to become a qualified engineer, after their vocational training is completed. In the U.S., there&#x27;s not as much discernment between theory and praxis, and one may not be entirely sure of receiving the right amount of each. The official certification one receives in Canada seems to signal the valuing of vocational training. Receiving an education in theory as a pre-requisite signals the value of theory.",1424391416

I abstract away some of the complicated queries with views, procs, and functions where allowable.<p>As for performance, different rdbms implement this differently, but the general query plan category for GROUP BY and DISTINCT is SORT. If you are querying something where you have multiple subqueries with DISTINCT and you and ordering the final results, you are adding extra sort operations to the query plan, hence hurting performance.<p>I tend to design everything to optimize read operations because there tends to be much more read than write in systems I work in. For me this means denormalized and heavily indexed where table/index scans are extremely rare. On smaller data sets, some rdbms always scan tables because it saves operations based on table statistics.<p>I hope this helps.",1424391411

The cronyism is also a concern.<p>The reason policies like this are viable politically is because public policy economists are far more comfortable estimating the direct effects of a tax than they are estimating some of the murkier, but nonetheless inevitable implications. 1st year microeconomics students learn to draw the supply and demand curves, draw in the price after tax and calculate lost consumer surplus and profits.

However, just because a law is abused by some women, does not mean &quot;there is hardly any problem of dowry&quot; - you are making a logical jump here.

Last time I heard there were about 9k dowry-related deaths (also from the NCRB); you&#x27;d expect the incidence of non-fatal violence would be higher, but I don&#x27;t know numbers for that. Regarding the &quot;ongoing campaign&quot; I saw things a while back, possibly it was &quot;Say No To Dowry&quot;, and there are others just from a quick web search.

Normally you try &quot;sin taxes&quot; which tax things reviewed as having NEGATIVE externalities (CO2, smoking, even unhealthy foods).<p>It&#x27;s like taxing people for reading books, or for volunteering their time to useful charities, or for picking up litter on the street.

8492101,comment,8491651,8491651,0,0,netcan,,,"Self driving vehicles are a new transport paradigm, potentially. The trajectory of these things is complicated with all sorts of intertwined positive feedbacks between technology, infrastructure, preceding technologies and succeeding technologies.<p>Roads were built for oxcarts. They followed routes used by donkey trains which followed paths used by walkers who followed pre existing animal runs wherever they could. The width of road cars and train tracks were based on the width of old roads. Shipping containers were designed to fit on trains and trucks. Ships were built to handle shipping containers, as are ports, depots and such. If you want to use something other than a standard shipping container, you probably need to design it to fit in to the shipping container world. It can all be traced back to wild goats making a path from one place to another.<p>The development os self driving cars as a major mode of transport depends on the development of stuff around it. Infrastructure is probably the big one. Our roads are built for human drivers in standard cars. If when roads start getting features designed specifically for robots, the whole thing could accelerate. I don&#x27;t just mean physical infrastructure of roads, but maybe the whole ruleset and/or economics of it.<p>Many old cities have a problem with 10 sq Kms of inner city traffic. Some ban or limit vehicles here. But, if people use robo taxis instead of cars, these inner cities can have different vehicles. Instead of big cars that must deal with trucks and highways perhaps inner cities can be handled by slower, lighter and safer like vehicles like golf carts. This might help solve some safety issues.",1413973219

There can be no good outcome of this situation because we either infuriate the Russians (we depend on the Russian gas) or the EU/USA.

Everybody is talking about the internet tax while the government is doing business with the Russians under cover. I don&#x27;t like the 150 HUF/GB but I know how it works here. There will be an upper bound per month (say 4000 HUF) for the tax. The ISPs can put this tax as an expense in their books and in the end the user will see something around 1000-2000 HUF per month plus. This is how it goes here.

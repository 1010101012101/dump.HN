I myself expect everything I say or do to eventually be public knowledge to anyone who wants to know, with increasing data processing tech, and try to govern my life accordingly.",1183765029

The country's most selective institution, it accepts 50 students a year and trains them in physics, computers and other sciences. Its mission is to create innovative, tech-savvy leaders capable of transforming Israel's military.<p>Upon graduating from the nine-year program, Mr. Czerniak took a different route: He helped launch Metacafe Inc., an online company that lets users post short videos, such as a clip of an acrobatic squirrel and one of a bikini-clad woman making a snow-angel. Now 32 years old, Mr. ...<p>EndBlockQuote<p>There is a great article on Talpiot in today's WSJ.

If you are running a startup you really should be reading WSJ, it's a great resource. Either way, a free version of this article will probably show up at one of WSJ properties soon enough.<p>Note, that the college + 6 year of service is not an exception in Israel, like the article implies.  You can enlist before college and serve shorter period as a private, or you can signup, go to college and then serve for 6 years as an officer.<p>The recipe seems to select the 50 most promicing freshmen in the country.  Train them hard (in existing university), have them serve the country, let them grow and then watch the GDP grow.",1183764775

Let me try this way:<p>How much would codetree need to change to accept a function or macro as input instead of a file, and produce output that is similarly meaningful?

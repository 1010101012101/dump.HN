PG may be a genius hacker and meta-entrepreneur, that doesn't mean that every little implementation detail in HN is perfect. The center tag, font-tag and so on are deprecated for good reasons, which there is no point in rehashing here.<p>For my part I don't care if people use presentation markup, and HN seem to work fine. However you should be aware that when you use the center-tag, you loose forever the right to look down on programmers who use VB or PHP to ""get the job done"" and who doesnt care about finding a better way.",1214992666

233961,comment,232890,232890,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"The problem with exceptions is that most developers using them don't use them well, which does kind of mean that they should be avoided if you're not sure you need it.  But I don't think that they have no place in running code.  (Since I write mostly Javascript, try/catch is so expensive that it's usually not worth it, especially if you build your site so that it works when the JS doesn't, which is just good practice.)<p>I recently came across something like this, which struck me as a horrendous abuse of ""exception"" handling:<p><pre><code>  // drastically simplified so as to not make anyone nauseous/crazy:\n\n  try {\n    $x = doSomething();\n    doSomethingElse($x);\n    if (!$x->foo) {\n      $x->foo = ""bar"";\n      throw new NoFooException($x);\n    }\n    doSomeMoreThings($x);\n  } catch NoFooException {\n    handleNoFooCase($x);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNot 10 lines later, in the same function:<p><pre><code>  do {\n    ...bunch of code.\n    if (!$x) {\n      break;\n    }\n    bunch more code.\n    if (!$y) {\n      break;\n    }\n    bunch more code.\n  } while(false);\n</code></pre>\nfollowed by new fewer than 3 other ""clever"" control constructs.<p>Frankly, GOTOs would have been easier to follow.",1214992226

233955,comment,232622,233949,0,0,Tichy,,,"It was maybe 5 years ago, and I was probably running that Java IDE ""plugin"" for Emacs, too. Might have been version 18.x, and a computer with 600MhZ CPU, 256MB RAM.<p>I know about etags, but that is just the thing: you have to set it up and run it regularly. Also, it did not work as well as an IDE that really understands the code (etags don't understand the code). At least that was my impression - my ""jumps"" in Emacs would frequently lead to the wrong place.<p>Edit: also, what I meant for navigation was the code outline. In an IDE, you get an extra window listing only the methods you defined in your code. You can click on a method and jump right to the code. The IDE thing for emacs did that, too, but not as nicely (it was in a weird sidebar without proper scrollbars, for one thing).<p>That is also a Java sickness of course, that there are zillions of interfaces and abstract classes with the same name (BlubInterface, AbstractBlubBase, BlubImpl). But Eclipse then gives you a popup where you can select the proper class (showing the classes hierarchically).",1214990984

233953,comment,232622,233873,0,0,Tichy,,,"Btw., I just checked how to do your transformation in Eclipse, using regular expressions. ctrl+f pops up the finder window. Check ""regular expressions"". Then in ""find"" enter "".* (\w+ \w+ \d)"" and in ""Replace With"" enter ""<li>$1</li>"". Press ""replace all"".<p>This gives you the <li>...</li> bits - add <ul> and </ul> by hand as you have to do in Vim.<p>The impressive thing is that the finder popup also includes context sensitive help for regular expressions. So If you type \, it gives you a list with all the options (\w for word character, \d for digit, and so on).<p>I am fairly good with regular expressions, not so much with keyboard shortcuts. Combined with the context sensitive help, the regular expressions are even more powerful.<p>I think Emacs also has regular expression search and replace, but without the context sensitive help.",1214990818

233950,comment,232725,232741,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,">could be handled by a simple tool that generates CSS.<p>Not quite.  Check the bits about changes to the DOM interfaces.  You can get and set variables via Javascript, and the styles of the page will all update as a result.  That's powerful and useful.<p>It is a bit of a slippery slope.  But it's hardly as bad as expression() ;)<p>Variables don't change the fundamental nature of CSS as a declarative rule-based language, and in my opinion at least, it's a pretty good fit.<p>But it also doesn't address the biggest problems with CSS.  I wrote about 5 of them here: <a href=""http://foohack.com/2007/10/top-5-css-mistakes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foohack.com/2007/10/top-5-css-mistakes/</a>  but I forgot the worst one of all.  The 12 billion keywords.  I'm not sure how that would have been done differently, since any declarative language is bound to have a big vocabulary, but I've seen so many novice webdevs struggle with remembering what does what. A good editor with auto-complete helps, but it's still a pain.",1214990533

What version of Emacs was this and what kind of machine did you have?  How did you configure it?  Anything capable of running Eclipse should have no problem running Emacs.  And as far as clicking on methods and jumping to places in the code goes, Emacs+etags (and M-x visit-tags-table) have been doing that pretty well for the past 15 years.",1214990528

233943,comment,233530,233530,0,0,pmjordan,,,"1-based arrays always make me think of the <i>Numerical Recipes</i> books, specifically the one using C. They jump through all sorts of hoops to have 1-based arrays:<p>- Array allocations are done using helper macros which invoke malloc and return a pointer to memory one element before the beginning of the array. (I'm pretty sure this is undefined behaviour according to the standard btw; it just happens that the format of pointers isn't data-dependent anymore these days)<p>- Array accesses are just as usual in C, except array[1] is the first element.<p>- Freeing memory is again wrapped in a macro to calculate the actual beginning of the array.<p>- Multidimensional arrays are layers of this crap.",1214989997
233942,comment,232725,233657,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"There are a few problems with doing that, in my experience.<p>First, from a theoretical point of view, Javascript is an functional language.  That's ideal for expressing event-driven behavior.  Not so great for expressing style information.  It's the difference between saying, ""When you walk in the room, look at the wall, and see that it is red"" vs saying ""The wall is red.""  Style information is best expressed in a declarative rule-based syntax.<p>Second, from a practical point of view, CSS and JS are loaded and run in different ways by the browser.  CSS, being a declarative rule-based language, can be loaded up ahead of time, and applied to the DOM all in one go.  Javascript must be parsed and evaluated, and respond to changes dynamically.  Great for click events, not so great for specifying FAC and layout.<p>Third, from a maintainability point of view, even when it perhaps makes some sense to set styles dynamically in Javascript (ie, DHTML), it's usually better to have the JS modify a className and put the style rules in a CSS file.  To the browser, it makes no difference. But to the next programmer dealing with your code, who's wondering where a particular style is coming from, it makes it a lot easier to fix bugs.  This is the ""don't put canned goods in the fridge"" rule.  Sure, it doesn't hurt the refrigerator or the can of soup, but you'll go a little crazy every time you look in the cupboard and can't find it.<p>That being said, the CSS/JS divide is far from conceptually or practically perfect.  CSS already has a bunch of event-driven hooks (:active, :focus, :hover, etc.), and there are some cases where you simply must modify the HTMLElement::style object.  But like everything else in a web page, there's a trade-off, and the rules of thumb are there for a reason.  Know them well, so that you can know when and why it's appropriate to break them.",1214989990
233941,comment,233836,233931,0,0,Mapou,,,"Which parallel programming startups are you referring to?  Sure, the established companies are adapting their exisiting tools to address the new multicore processors but I am not aware of any new parallel programming tools startups that failed. Most of the multicore processor startups are still around. Tilera, Ambric, Pico, etc... are still hanging in there. Pico is doing great. Israel's Plurality is just now beginning to get recognition for its self-balancing 64 to 256-core hypercore chip.<p>My point is that there are very few new multicore startups and I think that the reason is not that too many of them failed in the past but that only a few have had anything really interesting or disruptive to offer. It remains that there is a big problem that needs to be solved right now and whoever solves it will grab a lion share of the CPU market in this century.",1214989990
233940,comment,233486,233486,0,0,dgreensp,,,"Like others have said, I think 37s just wants another chance to say ""don't add features"".  This is old advice by now, though it's still good advice to take, depending on what you would otherwise do.  Some web apps these days might actually take it too far.<p>Also, as I've read others complaining about, 37s seems to treat bugfixes and features similarly.  I used Backpack for a while and am still slightly bitter that I couldn't put snippets of code in notes.  I forget the details, but their handling of angle-brackets in code did something obviously wrong, like double-escaping, and I wasn't able to get anyone there to even understand the problem.",1214989811
233939,comment,233166,233166,0,0,sutro,,,"Google/Yahoo/Adobe did you a favor. Dump the consumer-facing site and business model and reposition yourself as an enterprise software business, which will greatly increase your chances of monetizing this. Sell it to Autonomy or one of its competitors, or perhaps to one of the enterprise content vendors like Vignette and their ilk. I'm sure a little research would reveal other such opportunities.<p>Take a look at this company: <a href=""http://www.ephox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ephox.com</a>. It sells a WYSIWYG web content editor. Those things are a dime a dozen on sourceforge. They probably wouldn't cover their own hosting fees if they tried to sell a consumer/developer-facing version. So they have wisely embedded themselves with enterprise software vendors and are doing quite well for themselves as a result.<p>Transform your company into an Ephox.

I go to an expensive private college, and it's on the order of 120 for 4 years (though it's actually a 5-year school).<p>And if his kids are really entrepreneurial, as he claims, then they'll have the motivation to apply for scholarships like I did. I have received absolutely no financial help from my parents, and yet have accumulated very little debt.<p>I have learned most of my knowledge by teaching myself, and generally goof off during class if I even go (and no, that doesn't put me into the B group). But I've also been exposed to an incredible variety of people and built a huge network of friends and acquaintances in almost every industry.<p>Another point he seems to be missing is that to make a Facebook or Myspace app go viral, you need an initial network of users, typically your own friends. I hope his kids have fun trying to promote their app to all their high school friends who have gone off to college and lost contact.<p>I think what makes me most upset about this article, though, is that he's not using his views to make his own decisions, he's using them to make his kids' decisions. I feel really bad for his kids.",1202943093

The execution's really clean, and it seems that all that needs proving is the model itself.<p>My thought, though, is that you guys would drive a lot more tips if you focused on the people doing the tipping rather than the sites being tipped. Although there's certainly some altruism involved in tipping, I think the underlying drive for most when giving to charity is much more selfish. In real life, people make large donations to get their name put on buildings or to be respected as philanthropists. People tip in restaurants to not look cheap in front of their date and contribute to political campaigns so they can tell their friends they put their money where their mouth is.<p>In all of those situations, there's at least the ability to prove to other members of society that you did tip. In the case where you've tipped well beyond what might have been expected, you even get to be famous.<p>All of this comes down to the question: Why not provide widgets that show the top X tippers for a given website? You get peer pressure via the suggestion that you <i>should</i> be tipping like these guys, and you let the people kicking in lots of money feel special and be a minor celebrity within that community.

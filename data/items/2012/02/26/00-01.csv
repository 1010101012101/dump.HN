I am a big fan of well designed sites, but at the same time I think design needs to serve a purpose.<p>First, In the case of DrudgeReport, people go there for hand-picked content, probably learning about the site through referrals. Although design would make things look prettier, it wouldn't attract more readers, in that case.<p>Second, good design doesn't mean pretty things. Imho, for most products, user-experience is more important than fancy graphics. People need to want to use your site, and then they need to be able to use your site!<p>Lastly, it all depends on your business. If you're building something where your content is judged by the looks of your site, then by all means go ahead and make something really sexy. However, if your site is judged by the content, make sure the usability is top-notch and you can apply a sexy skin later.<p>p.s. All that said, if you're releasing a new product that needs to capture attention from a wide audience or you need to stand out among competitors, then yes, you need to make sure your design (among other things) is the best on the market. After all, you want to be noticed!",1330217981

They may not have seen this coming, but it's been in their face for a while now, and even if a few can't see what's going on I simply can't believe that none of them do.

That said, don't you have the possibility of something blocking the path of the door regardless of which way it swings?  I guess if it's on your side of the door, there is a greater chance that you can move it out of the way as long as it's not too hot or bulky.  Then again, if something unexpected is blocking the way in a fire I'd expect there is a very good chance that it <i>is</i> hot or bulky.<p>So far I was under the impression that doors should generally open towards the exit (as the sibling already noted) in order to make it as easy as possible to exit the building.  But maybe that is a misconception.  I find this a very interesting topic, if you have more information to share I'd be very curious.<p>EDIT: Also, aren't hot door handles a big issue in case of a fire?  I'd imagine that the ability to push the door open (assuming it doesn't lock when closed) rather than having to pull the handle is a plus.

If these are true, then there's an opportunity for us to learn about our strengths and weaknesses, at least according to Google's POV.<p>If liability is an issue, have us sign a waiver.<p>Actually there are 4 possible attitudes about the Google Interview, according to what you believe:\n1. Both claims are true: you don't have any problem with Google.\n2. Only the utility claim is false: the interview is pointless, and can't be learned from.\n3.

UAVs are getting very cheap and we can control them well.<p>There are opportunities too in labour-intensive business like order fulfilment. Amazon uses lots of people and could replace some of them with robots like Kiva Systems. Amazon is interesting since they will probably do it cheaply and cleverly, now that Kiva has invested and shown that it can be done.<p>In summary: the robots you see every day are ATMs, dishwashers, etc. The more robot-like robots are hidden away working for you.

Many candidates from schools which I would consider to be top 20 (like USC) even could not even get past a simple programming question a la ""fizzbuzz"" test. I would probably trust 5-10 US schools, but it seems for many American universities Masters program is just a money making engine.",1330215035

Interviewers are supposed to ask more than one technical question; the candidates I am enthusiastic about hiring tend to solve 2-3.  That said, some problems are multi-facted enough that an interviewer can run with the same basic theme for the whole interview, I just think it would be unusual for that to be the case in all five interviews.",1330214856

3634281,comment,3633405,3633405,3,0,snikolov,,,"I went to Stuy and have always believed that requiring people to score high on an exam that tests verbal and mathematical reasoning skills is a good thing.<p>Now, a score on a single exam is not a particularly great way to admit people for many reasons, but if we accept that it is an objective test of mathematical and verbal reasoning skills, why not help minorities score high enough (or let people know that there is an exam in the first place)?<p>In college admissions (at least in theory), affirmative action takes effect only after all the candidates have passed some minimum bar in terms of quantifiable things like SATs, grades, etc. Admission to Stuy is based only on a test so one can apply the same principle: Look at people holistically only after they've passed the minimum bar.<p>I think we should help minorities make the cutoff and <i>then</i> take a closer look at those applicants who scored high enough (though perhaps not using a hard threshold). Of course this is easier said than done, but I think ignoring such a test completely and relying on GPAs or interviews or other things alone would not be a good idea. Most people haven't ""done"" many things in middle school the way people do things in high school that distinguish them when they apply to college. Please correct me if I'm wrong on this. (And I actually think one of the goals is to make sure that kids have a lot more opportunities and encouragement to distinguish themselves by the time they finish middle school)<p>Now, perhaps the current cutoff for getting into Stuy is analogous to getting above a 2300 on the SAT, and elite institutions seem to agree that a 2300 is no more predictive of success than a 2200 or a 2100. So it would be interesting to measure how scores on the admission exam correlate to various metrics of success in college and later in life in order to determine a similar threshold above which the score doesn't matter anymore.",1330214743

3634275,comment,3633369,3633369,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I believe it is a way of thinking. I once told someone who asked me about the same question ""How can you <i>not</i> see new ideas here?""<p>I'm a problem solver, and when there is a problem from ""keys locked in the car"" to ""too expensive to move mass to lunar orbit"" I just start speculating solutions. Knowing that any problem is in fact a series of problems the other problems get solution speculations on their own, and out of those hundreds or thousands of ideas pop out things that occasionally are both implementable and monetizable.<p>To give an example of how I think, one day when I was taking a shower I recognized that I'm so busy thinking about things that I sometimes lose track of whether or not I've done one round of shampoo or two. So that suggested a solution where I could make a note after the first shampoo and after the second. And then looking what I had to work with I realized that I could algorithmically determine the issue if I left the cap open on the first go round and if I grabbed the shampoo and the cap was open it was round 2 so just close it. Basically transferring the 'state' of how many times I'd gone around the loop in the state of the cap. Problem solved, no cost. Maybe a nice thank you if I sent it in to ""Helpful Hints from Heloise.""<p>So looking around at problems they come in some common forms.<p>They are the result of something being too complicated thus requiring either specialists or training time.<p>They are the result of not managing state (like my shampoo problem) where the stage of the solution needs to be recoverable.<p>They are a result of an economic barrier, so its too expensive to do X which causes problem Y, can you do X more cheaply?<p>They are the side effect of a desirable thing, so doing X is desirable but has (or sometimes has) undesirable side effect Y. Here the solution makes X better because you find a way to mitigate Y.<p>They are problems of comprehension. The human brain has a finite capacity for maintaining state, so solutions that either abstract out chunks (and free up the brain for more relevant state) or eliminate complexity, win in those situations.<p>Then there are solutions that are not currently possible, but would be if 'X' existed. For example, if you had unlimited energy you could easily create liquid fuels out of the air. Sometimes its useful to think about those kinds of things and watch for the 'unlimited energy' appearing in the news (as it would if we suddenly mastered the fusion cycle for example).  A variation on this I was doing back in the 80's as a network programmer at Sun wondering what sort of things would be possible when everyone had high speed network access. Consider the more probable new capability like 'easy access to space'. So there are folks like Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, etc who are working toward making access to space available to non-NASA types. What problems are those people going to have? Gucci barf bags anyone? How about the sex market for them? We know that nearly every nerd who goes into space, if they have a wee bit of privacy is going to be thinking how they try out sex in space. What do they need to do that? Bigelow wants to put inflatable hotels up there, what kind of luggage do they need?<p>And there are all sorts of geeky technical problems like ""how do you make white space spectrum available to everyone? "", ""What sort of cash drawer thing is useful for an NFC enabled world?"", ""How do I enable non-technical people to have all their purchased video available at their TV?"" (clearly the media PC hasn't quite gotten the recipe right there).<p>If the market is small ask what folks with high levels of disposable income might want.<p>If cars can self drive how would you build a parking structure for them?<p>How can I build something that would auto-plug in my Tesla and save it from being bricked without thinking about it?<p>What does 3D printing mean for the toy business? Can you build a device which parents of young kids or day care centers could use to generate a steady stream of safe toys?<p>What would it take to make a solar powered device which recycles plastic bottles or cans into something which is more easily processed into new products? Can you build a device which powderizes these materials and then feeds them into feed hoppers for an industrial scale 3D printer? Bottles in one side, park benches out the other?<p>The thought sequence, venture wise, is always the same:<p>1) How many people have this problem.<p>2) How many other ways are there to solve it or live with it.<p>3) What would it cost to offer a solution?<p>4) How does the cost compare with the pain of the problem, and the cost of other options (including 'doing nothing'!)<p>You can use personal experience to work out some intangibles (like how many lines of code would it take and how long to write) and sometimes you have to construct small experiments which help inform the outcome. The key is that if you are ready to accept that your idea isn't feasible (productwise) to just move on. There are lots and lots and lots of ideas out there.",1330214587

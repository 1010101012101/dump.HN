8346411,comment,8346240,8346364,4,0,danbmil99,,,"> Bullshit. There hasn&#x27;t been a laissez fair in the healthcare industry in the United States in 100 years.<p>True. But why did health care turn away from a completely free-market approach? Why does almost every other industrialized society now support some sort of single-payer system, at least for those who cannot afford private boutique care?<p>The answer is simple: as a society, we do not accept the results of a truly free-market health care system.  100 years ago, it was accepted that you could become ill at any point in your life, and very possibly die. Being rich was not really a lifesaver, because many if not most major disease categories were at that time untreatable, or the treatments available were palliative at best.<p>Now, we live in a world where we all know fully well that with enough access, many medical situations that used to be fatal are now treatable with excellent chances of full or near-full recovery.  Steve Jobs gets a liver; Dick Cheney gets a heart. My wife&#x27;s uncle just died of a heart condition similar to Cheney&#x27;s. Somehow, there was no transplant available for him.<p>In this world, most people find it unacceptable that your health outcome is directly related to your wealth and social status.  The world you suggest -- where everyone simply pays out of pocket -- would be socially regressive in a way that I believe is abhorrent to most civilized people, with the glaring exception of around 50% of the US voting public.<p>Insurance was developed as a reasonable fair-market way to ameliorate this issue of health care access disparity. If you can afford insurance -- in the US, this typically was through getting a decent job that provided a large risk pool and could therefore negotiate reasonable premiums -- you could at least theoretically rest assured that a major medical crisis would not totally bankrupt you.<p>But for those outside of the pool of large employers, the insurance companies started doing bad stuff (from a customer&#x27;s POV) -- dropping the sick, refusing to cover previous conditions etc. In their defense, insurers had the problem that without some sort of  mandate, people could just go uninsured until they got sick. So the individual market was destined to be over-represented by older, sicker people.<p>If you really believe in laissez faire, free-market medicine, you (as a society) have to accept the following:<p>* People who treat themselves like shit for years and get sick (obesity-related diabetes is a great example) can simply drop dead if they can&#x27;t afford expensive care and medication.<p>* If some idiot on a motorcycle without a helmet spins out and breaks their skull, and is not rich, shovel his body to the side of the road, wait for him to die, and call sanitation to remove the body<p>* If your parents get old and sick, and they fucked up their retirement planning, slip them some clonazepam or watch them wither away painfully over a period of months or years. Be prepared for someone in the family to quit their job and become a nurse, or let Grandma wander around until she falls down and hopefully dies on the spot.<p>That was basically where everyone was throughout most of history. Only difference is, now we know it can be better. But in a ruthlessly free-market society, only the rich and well-connected would ever have a chance of getting the best possible care.",1411278857

Most people cannot pay this out of their pocket.<p>In the Western European countries where healthcare does actually work and is affordable for everyone, it is strongly regulated and continually fine-tuned to find and eliminate spots where the system is abused. E.g. for years in the Netherlands doctors would prefer some expensive medicines when there are cheap alternatives, because their manufacturer gave them nice bonuses. The state outlawed such practices. Moreover, in cases where it is shown that there are medicines from different manufacturers with an equal amount of relevant substances, insurance companies now only prescribe the most affordable one.<p>Anyway, I have lived in two countries where there is strongly government regulated healthcare (The Netherlands and Germany) and never had any qualms about the systems. I have also seen people close to me with small health problems to various forms of cancer, and for no one this was ever a financial problem. Luckily.",1411278745

As a counterpoint, the author mentions the insurance company pays the full amount to Dr. Mu for the other anecdote in the story.<p>3. fearful language -- &#x27;He was blindsided, though, by a bill of about $117,000 from an “assistant surgeon,” a Queens-based neurosurgeon whom Mr. Drier did not recall meeting.&#x27;  Sounds like a 24-hour-news-cycle headline: &quot;Patients billed by doctors while under anesthesia&quot;.<p>4. mentioning there are marketing firms who specialize in helping maximize billing with insurance, as if it&#x27;s an unethical business.  This happens every time a provider of a service or product interacts with a bureaucracy -- there is a whole layer of these services for defense contracting, for example.<p>5. they mention how the US has more neurosurgeons per capita, then link that (by proximity in the same paragraph) to providing motive by mentioning how neurosurgeon compensation has decreased recently.  A more honest article would have given absolute numbers about how the costs of neurosurgery relate to overall health care costs, rather than making the niche appear large relative to the story, so the reader implicitly compares that impact to the $2.8 trillion number.<p>Medical billing is absurdly complex and byzantine.

8346336,comment,8345410,8345410,8,0,nkurz,,,"Thanks for writing this.  It&#x27;s great to see more articles this in HN.<p>The assembly in the article looks like it was compiled without optimization, which is going to change the exact numbers quite a bit.  Contrary to what it sounds like, &quot;without optimization&quot; really means something like &quot;output some strange dialect of antiquated assembly that&#x27;s 10 times slower than it needs to be&quot;.  It&#x27;s really only useful if you are debugging the compiler.  In particular, it&#x27;s pushing all the variables onto the stack even though it doesn&#x27;t need to, so that they are there in case you need to check them manually.  99% of the time you want to be compiling with -02, -03, or -0fast.<p>With gcc -O3 for x64, here&#x27;s what they look like.  The functions are shorter, faster, and in some ways easier to understand:<p><pre><code>  align_1:\n        leal    7(%rdi), %eax\n        andl    $-8, %eax\n        ret\n</code></pre>\nThe first integer arg always comes in %rdi/%edi.  The compiler has recognized the idiom, and transformed it into (x + 7) & (0b11..11000).  LEA is &quot;load effective address&quot;, and in this case is a slightly shorter way of writing &#x27;ADD&#x27;, but no faster.<p><pre><code>  align_2:\n                cmpl    $8, %edi\n                movl    $8, %eax\n                jbe     .L6\n        .L5:\n                addl    $8, %eax\n                cmpl    %eax, %edi\n                ja      .L5\n                rep ret\n        .L6:\n                rep ret\n</code></pre>\n&quot;If x < 8 (jbe == jump before or equal), return 8.  Otherwise keep adding 8 until it&#x27;s greater (jump after), and return that&quot;.  The return value is whatever is in %eax on return.  The &#x27;rep ret&#x27; is a funny way of saying return, apparently done to be slightly faster on ancient AMD processors.  At this point it&#x27;s cruft.  And there is no real reason to have two return statements --- that&#x27;s the kind of wacky thing compilers like to do even when optimizing.<p><pre><code>  align_3:\n                movl    %edi, %edi\n                subq    $8, %rsp\n                cvtsi2sdq       %rdi, %xmm0\n                mulsd   .LC0(%rip), %xmm0\n                call    ceil\n                mulsd   .LC1(%rip), %xmm0\n                addq    $8, %rsp\n                cvttsd2siq      %xmm0, %rax\n                ret\n        .LC0:\n                .long   0\n                .long   1069547520\n        .LC1:\n                .long   0\n                .long   1075838976\n</code></pre>\nThe first &#x27;movl&#x27; wipes out any bits greater than 32 if they are there. This is because x was defined as an int, and not a long.  In general, you might be better off always using long unless there is a specific reason not to.  Then we convert the int to floating point.  Floating point on modern systems uses the 128-bit XMM registers that are also used for vectors.  We put it into %xmm0, because that is register for the first floating point or vector arg.  Keeping the result in %xmm0, multiply by what is presumably a floating point constant equal to ALIGN and then call ceil().  The result is also returned in %xmm0. Then because multiplication is much faster than division, multiply by ALIGN and then call ceil().  Then because multiplication is much faster than division, multiply by another constant that is is approximately (and depending on the value of the alignment, this might be a significant fact) equal to 1/align. Convert that back to a 32-bit &quot;signed integer quadword&quot; (siq) and return it.<p>The trickiness with optimizing (which is probably why you used the mangled unoptimized version) is that the compiler has a tendency to optimize them out completely so you end up testing an empty loop.  Your choices are either work in assembly directly so what you see is what you get, or to be crafty and come up with something that prevents the compiler from doing so: a checksum, or perhaps a comparison that you know the result of but hopefully the compiler doesn&#x27;t.<p>Here are the timings in cycles on a Haswell system.  I compiled with &#x27;-fno-inline&#x27;, which would be faster, but might skew the results more in this case, even though function calls are fast on x64.<p>baseline: 5.3 cycles for a loop that returns x and compares against zero.<p>align_1:  5.0 cycles including the loop. Yes, in this case adding the two instructions of the function actually took fewer cycles than baseline loop.  It&#x27;s more than ILP voodoo, it&#x27;s a whole way of life!<p>align_2: 62 cycles per iteration.  Horrible, but not as bad as the uncompiled mess.  But it worth pointing out that while you don&#x27;t want to use a loop here, there are much faster loops.  Perhaps while (x % align != 0) { x++ }?  This gets you down to 11 cycles, only 6 more than the baseline.  Interestingly, it&#x27;s this fast because the processor apparently can perfectly predict the number of loop iterations after the first 30, which is a little scary.<p>align_3: 19 cycles per call.  Faster than the silly loop, but really not a way you want to approach this problem unless you&#x27;ve really thought through all the floating point details.<p>I put my code up at <a href=""https://gist.github.com/nkurz/985470b01b999e67d04b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/nkurz/985470b01b999e67d04b</a>. \nAt the bottom are more numbers provided by Likwid for things like number of instructions, number of branch errors, etc.",1411276416

So not only was it imperative to promote patient health, but it was also important to balance that with the overall cost. A good example is a simple blood test. A full spectrum blood test may help identify potential problems in a patient, but it costs OHIP a lot of money to run those tests (especially since they&#x27;re done in private for-profit labs). That&#x27;s why your family doctor should really only order the required tests.",1411275877

That&#x27;s a shame because he&#x27;s clearly interested in it.<p>Little parenthesis: if you&#x27;re interested in a subject, make the effort to read about it from well established sources (very often, books). The author of the posted article relies on sources like LifeHacker and pop psychology journalism to build his knowledge and make his claims, but those are clearly shallow, insufficient, and inaccurate.<p>I feel like this is a problem that the internet has created- it makes it possible to feel knowledgeable in certain topics after reading a lot of informal web pages on a given topic, but very often that content is far from being authoritative. Reading less blogs/pop journalism/etc. and more books from established academics is one of the most beneficial moves you can do for the depth and accuracy of your various bodies of knowledge.",1411275730

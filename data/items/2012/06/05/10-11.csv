What I think we <i>really</i> want is something more akin to what we have for native development: choice.<p>We should have things like JVMs for the browser (cached on the client-side, no doubt), but we should also have non-portable code for people who want to do things that cannot be done portably. A bytecode standard cannot be all things to all people, because some people need to do things that can't be done on some platforms.<p>If you really want everything to move to the web you need to expose vector math instructions for video encoding, you need to expose CUDA for scientific applications and so on. You need to be able to ship machine-code to the client where it can run (properly sandboxed, no doubt).<p>Of course, if you want everything to move to the web there are bigger problems to overcome - HTML and CSS aren't really suited to application development, the filesystem APIs are not sufficient, and there's still the problem of getting GUI applications to compose well...",1338893631

However, now there will be a much stronger incentive to use cross-platform engines in the future. It used to be ""windows + mac port"" for a lot of games. ""windows + mac port + linux port"" sounds silly, so the obvious solution is to start with something that already <i>is</i> cross-platform.<p>Wasteland 2 chose Unity engine because it's so cross-platform. It even has unpolished Linux support. The Linux port of Unity hasn't been released, because developers were doing that in their spare time and it wasn't up to Unity creators' standards. Now, InExile has been given Unity source for purposes of creating a decent Linux port. It's a single anecdote, but it illustrates what I'm saying above. Makers of Unity will probably want to get the most out of it, so Linux port of Unity will be contributed ""upstream"" and it's very likely that Unity will support Linux from now on.",1338890788

Many of the mapped roads only show the view from one lane, and if the road is more than one lane wide, you're missing data on the positions of the other lane(s). I can't count the number of times the view I wanted was on the other side of a median or divider, with no data for that side. Following a pre-mapped course on a multi-lane road using only Street View data would be a nightmare. Reminds me of the stories of people pulling U-turns in the middle of a freeway because their GPS told them to.",1338890763

There are many, many people who would rather pay $5, $10, $20 or more per month to ensure that Pandora stays alive.  How about limiting the number of songs you can listen to on the free iPhone client and selling a premium client for $9.99?

695995,comment,695631,695631,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I'm one of those middle-aged users of Facebook. What I find appalling about Facebook is how much its context changes users' online behavior. Many of the people on my friends list of Facebook are people I also know from specialized, topical email lists. On the email lists, the people are serious and thoughtful, but on Facebook some of the same people let loose with a bajillion ""What grocery produce section vegetable are you?"" quizzes and endless flair and bling and mafia wars. My friends are less my friends, and more of an annoyance, on the Facebook platform. Facebook turns adults into kids.<p>So although I appreciate Facebook for linking me up to a few former classmates from childhood (my first Facebook friend was one such), if I want to do what I really enjoy, as a grown-up adult, I look for those same friends in other contexts. And that, I think, is why Facebook is extremely unlikely to build a business model through which it can gain more revenue per user than it has expenses per user to serve up cute photographs and videos.",1247151463

695991,comment,695708,695968,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"It looks ""weird"" because it uses a much better method of anti-aliasing. The Windows system is worse than shit. It is hell for designers because it's impossible to make fonts look anything other than shit without turning them huge, and even then they look like shit. Safari is the shining exception.<p>I'm not defensive. You're the one who just got into a little minirant. I was explaining why I prefer Safari for development and you returned with the little gems like ""Excuse me for not caring very much for Safari, when Firefox is my main browser and does everything I need."" You know, some of us here <i>don't</i> comment just to ""beat"" you. Sometimes we comment because we honestly think you've raised a point worth debating and discussing. I'm sorry for responding to you like you wanted a debate, instead of assuming you were a prick.<p><i>If you are talking about speed, I honestly don't care. If you are talking about CSS3 feature-set, I honestly don't care either, because using any CSS3 features while people are still using MSIE would be messing up the experience for about 50% of your visitors.</i><p>So there's no room for graceful degradation, then? If CSS3 lets me craft a better user experience for some users, then I'll give it to them. It's why we don't primarily design for IE 6 and its crippled users. We give other users what they want, then focus on stepping down.<p><i>As for Safari being ""one of only two browsers that fully supports HTML5""... You know that HTML5 is only a draft at this point? The spec isn't even finalized. The Acid 3 test even admits this much, saying it's testing features which may or may not end up in a official spec.</i><p>Safari supports what there is at the moment. That's better than Mozilla's ""We don't need to do anything re:HTML 5 and our competitors are evil for supporting the standards"" line that they touted last year.<p><i>I'll test my shit in Safari, but that's as far as I'm willing to go with exposure to craptacular Apple software on Windows.</i><p>Ignore all the other stuff I commented on, since it's obvious you'll just disagree and neither of us will get anything out of it. What makes Safari craptacular? Safari 4 on Windows has a native feel, it runs 3x faster than Firefox, uses less memory, has a smoother interface in many ways, and has quite a few features (including that anti-aliasing) that Firefox lacks. Perhaps it's not your choice for a web browser, which is totally coo', but I resent your calling it craptacular and implicitly insulting all the Windows users who think Safari 4 is worth their using.",1247151406

695977,comment,695421,695866,0,0,jacquesm,,,"A common trick to show an upward trend is to show just the first and last point of something that has gone up in a certain period without showing the data in between. Like that it always looks like you are going 'up', no matter what.<p>If you look at the datapoints in between you get to see more detail, in this case a meteoric rise over the first couple of days and then a fairly steady decline, which is a more realistic picture. So, in this respect I'm more inclined to believe alexa.com over compete, not because they give me a story that I'd like to hear but simply because their data offers more transparency. In the long run (over many month) there will be more convergence between the shapes of the graphs, but for the moment alexa gives a more realistic image to extrapolate from, simply because it shows you more intermediate points. If alexa had just shown the first and last datapoints then the graph would have been the same but the conclusion would have been completely different.<p>Of course you're entirely free to disagree with that :)<p>For the record, I use my own site (ww.com) as a benchmark whenever I look at other sites to try to figure out the bias of the reporting agency but with sites as large as msn, google and bing that is not a useful technique because my own site is so much smaller that it is simply a flat line.",1247151045

That's about as useful as saying that alcoholism is caused by over-drinking.<p>There are all sorts of diseases and conditions that cause obesity, and we know for a fact that the primary cause is not eating too much (eating too much or too little is the effect): menopause-induced weight gain, drug-induced weight-gain, cancer-induced weight loss.<p>The idea that the recent (post-1970) epidemic of obesity might have something to do with the massive amounts of refined carbohydrates we began consuming (in response to low-fat hysteria) is not a bizarre one. Sugar is a brand-new element to the human diet and now we're eating 100 pounds per year per capita.<p>And with your last statement, you aren't seriously denying the primacy of growth hormone in childhood growth, are you?

I think a lot of youthful rebellion of recent decades has been changed by this.<p>One middle aged woman I spoke to on the plane noted that there is a need to be able to ""compartmentalize"" one's online social networking, much as one does this for work.  Her country club employees (where she works) have Facebook profiles which she uses to try and make contacts for new sales, and she finds that some of her fellow early 20's employees have Spring Break pictures only a few clicks away from hers.  Not the best thing for her.  I suggested LinkedIn, but this doesn't quite work for what she has in mind.",1247148286

Where I disagree is with the criticism of the data used for the article and then use of equally unreliable data to prove the point.<p>The Alexa data has more points, but it's looking at the same period of time so I'm not buying into the idea that it's more realistic. Not to mention day to day numbers are a microscopic view of a much larger picture.<p>We've got two measurements of the same thing that seem to be drawing two different conclusions. I don't think anyone could reliably come to the conclusion that one is more accurate than the other based on the information we have.",1247148271
695865,comment,695708,695708,0,0,halo,,,"I don't really find these arguments compelling.<p>Using the Acid3 test in this context is misleading. Acid3 tests a random selection features to ensure they work corrrectly. In this case, Firefox 3.5 fails on 7 of the tests and 5 of these are due to SMIL (pretty much SVG animation) and SVG fonts. They are obscure features, and don't provide a compelling reason to choose Safari over Firefox, least of all for development where you won't be able to use those features in the real world until other browsers implement them. Whatsmore, in designing Acid3, Hixie deliberately picked on browser bugs so the test didn't favour one vendor, irrespective of how they effect the real world - taking a single number out of context and point at that to prove the innate superiority of one browser over another, or that one browser follows ""better standards"", is incredibly simplistic, let along drawing conclusions that sites will be easier to port because of it. At worst, all it could tell you is that one vendor is focusing on passing a test and another isn't.<p>I don't really see the pre-optimisation as a real-world issue, and I seriously doubt bugs creep in through it. It feels very much like somebody making a problem out of nothing.<p>All projects have long niggles and bugs that have been there since the dawn of time. The fact that Firefox has bugs spanning years is more of a sign that the Mozilla project has been around for years than inehrent tardiness.<p>I also don't really understand the conclusion that ""OS X is the only system that allows me to test all major browsers side-by-side by means of virtualization software"". In actuality, if testing is your priority, then Windows would probably be the platform of choice as it's the only platform that can run all the major browsers (IE6, IE7, IE8, Firefox, Safari and Chrome) natively. Linux can also virtualise all the browsers not available natively through virtualisation of Windows, no different from Mac OS X.",1247148204

The things Mathematica is able to do backed by a giant structured data store seemed mind blowing.\nAs the author said the visualization tools and the (still small) dataset _is_ impressive. I thought: We have all this data, all this visualization options and now we can create aggregate and munch all the facts of the world with an ad-hoc query language. But this simply does not work. There is hardly any functionality to really process data (aside from the predefined ways). And if you come to think about it: One cannot think of a way more complex transformations could be expressed with WA's natural language interface.<p>For me a better interface would look like this: The basic interface is some kind of full-featured expression language to navigate the data hierarchy (perhaps similar to SQL). You could then build some GUI to interactively navigate/parametrize data/transformations to build more complex expressions. To make the system more easily accessible you could then - and only then - add the natural language recognition system on top of this, which tries to guess some expressions from your input string and gives you some suggestions to start from.",1247148038

7712620,comment,7710912,7712496,6,0,tptacek,,,"Three things:<p>1. The difference between an Occupy encampment and a clustered homeless population is that the Occupy encampment is there to disrupt the surrounding area (that&#x27;s the point: to generate awareness) and the homeless cluster is there for safety and convenience --- in other words, for the intrinsic benefit of the people in the cluster. Policy responses to those two different circumstances aren&#x27;t comparable.<p>2. I do not disagree that displacing organic, emergent clusters of homeless people to improve optics and quality of life for residents and tourists is an unfriendly and probably unhelpful policy response to homelessness. It is not my contention that shuttling homeless people out of the Mag Mile in Chicago is a positive step. This is, however, the <i>standard</i> policy response to homelessness in much of the US (not just Chicago), because the overwhelming majority of urban residents want it to be.<p>3. The relativism underpinning your sentiment about not judging the lifestyle of the homeless is disquieting. Homeless people aren&#x27;t hobos. They aren&#x27;t deliberately living a different lifestyle. They are an underserved population of mentally ill, substance-dependent people continually victimized by their circumstances through lack of medical care, death by exposure, and crime. Let me help you out: it is OK to judge homelessness as bad. Homelessness is bad.",1399496366

I know few such people myself<p>- Important point: During the 4-6 years when the spouse cannot legally work, either they have given up on their career or have already signed up for a graduate program in order to get an F1.

Perhaps that&#x27;s why I am a little familiar with what is already available for beginners. The issue for undergrads isn&#x27;t that resources don&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t know what exists. Twenty years ago my CS major neighbor turned me on to Mosaic, but had never heard of Dr. Dobbs. And he was a senior. A year ago, I was talking with a CS Junior who knew nothing about what an embedded system was. He only became aware at a job fair. Hadnt heard of YC either, sohe got my copy of <i>Hackers and Painters</i>.<p>Anyway, the danger you face is that you&#x27;ve cut the scope all the way back to undergraduates and begun to cast it as a traditional textbook. One that has to introduce C and x86 assembly and has to address the practical issues of testing and running a new minimal OS on their development machine [under Windows, OSX, and Linux?].

7712546,comment,7710733,7712403,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Hydrogen was used for the Saturn upper stages for performance reasons, since at the time that was more important than cost. If cost is a concern it&#x27;s generally cheaper just to build a larger rocket and use LOX/Kerosene everywhere. The fascinating thing about rocket development throughout history is that almost none of it has ever been truly cost sensitive.<p>The big advantage for SpaceX in using the same propellant and mostly the same engine in the 2nd stage on the Falcon 9 is that the 2nd stage is dirt cheap. In any other rocket they&#x27;d see the opportunity to build a small little LOX/LH2 stage and improve the payload tremendously. But then you&#x27;d end up with a lot of cost in the 2nd stage, which is precisely what SpaceX doesn&#x27;t want. With the Falcon 9 design 3/4 of the manufacturing cost is in the first stage. Which means that reusing <i>just</i> the first stage (by far the easiest reusability prospect) nets huge gains. This is what you call low lying fruit. And it&#x27;s fruit that would have been there for anyone else to pick except they kept making the tree taller without thinking about it, instead of just picking the fruit.<p>So now instead of a more expensive rocket with more payload SpaceX ends up with a vastly less expensive rocket with slightly less payload (easily worked around with the Falcon Heavy configuration). Even just 2 reflights of the first stage translates to an overall reduction of 50% in the capital cost of each flight (or 60% in the case of the FH).",1399495412

Maybe 2.  What about blues or reds?  Pretty much the same.  But you can find a ton of teals, purples, and pinks!<p>This is because producing naive permutations of fixed steps results mostly in muddy hue variance <i>between</i> the primaries.  This is not the natural way we see color variance.  It results in far too many unique hues and not enough shades of the &quot;good&quot; hues (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, etc.).  We only really distinguish between 7-15 hues at a basic level, but then we are used to seeing many shades of those same hues.<p>In addition, because the way the permutations are created it would be a ton of work to figure out how to sort them by hue.  And if you did, you would notice just how many hues there are (way too many to care about having so many).<p>A much better color picker will take just a handful of hues (again, 7-15 or so) and then present varying shades (lighter, usually, but also darker for more variance) of them. Another crucial factor is to make sure the color picker includes a row for all shades from black to white (which at least this color picker has done).<p>For an example of a color picker that does this well with just a handful of colors, see the Google docs color picker.[2]  You&#x27;ll notice how much more pleasing it is to the eye.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Web-safe_colors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Web-safe_colors</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.google.com/help/hc/images/docs/docs_1696586_color_picker_en.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/help/hc/images/docs/docs_1696586_colo...</a>",1399494634

Disk clutter after lots of builds is a problem which we&#x27;re very much addressing. It&#x27;s specifically a top-level <i>docker clean</i> command that I&#x27;m not a fan of, because it doesn&#x27;t capture a clear intent - what are you cleaning, and who determines what should be kept and what shouldn&#x27;t? In general I like to avoid Docker having to guess what you want - the proverbial &quot;magic&quot;.<p>A few notes:<p>* The reason Docker can clutter your disk is because we made an explicit tradeoff: it&#x27;s better to keep too much data than to remove too much. That is why we&#x27;re able to say &quot;yes, you can run a database on Docker. Neither the container nor its data will be removed, at any point, unless you explicitly request it&quot;. Everytime I hear someone complain &quot;there&#x27;s too much stuff on my disk&quot;, I rejoice that I am not instead hearing &quot;Docker ate my data&quot;.<p>* We have already introduced a few improvements. For example Docker used to keep the intermediary container for each build step (for later inspection of the build output, transient state etc). Now, by default, we don&#x27;t.<p>* The most elegant fix, I believe, is to use naming and tagging as an indication of interest. If you are interested in keeping an image, give it a name (for example with &#x27;docker build -t&#x27;). When an image no longer has a name referencing it, instead of keeping it around as an anonymous image like it does today, Docker can remove garbage collect it. That should take care of the problem elegantly and without requiring a new, clunky top-level command.<p>TLDR: the &quot;disk clutter&quot; problem is the result of a conscious tradeoff which we are glad we made. We have started fixing it, and there are more fixes to come.",1399494520

7712343,comment,7710733,7711538,4,0,gvb,,,"My take on the rationale behind Christophe Bonnal&#x27;s statement:<p>If you have a market for 400 engines a year and build 400 engines a year, you will get good at building engines and you will have a lot of opportunity to improve your ability to build all those engines.<p>If you have a market of 400 engines a year but reuse each engine 40 times, your build rate will converge on building 10 new engines a year.  Once your initial production is done and you are in the sustaining level, you will be back in the boat of all the other rocket companies that are only building ~10 engines a year.  The inference is that 10 engines a year doesn&#x27;t give you the volume to sustain (and refine) your low cost build process.<p>Where I think the argument goes wrong the worst is that Christophe Bonnal is mapping traditional rocket making experience - low rate production of very complex, very expensive hardware - onto SpaceX.  SpaceX is rewriting the rules.  They appear to have rewritten the rules on the cost of expendable rockets and, with reuse, will rewrite those rules again. That <i>should</i> rewrite the rules on the number of launches since they will be much more affordable.<p>The (counter) premise is that dropping prices of reusable rockets will allow more launches which will absorb what would otherwise be excess SpaceX rocket building capacity.",1399493049

7712337,comment,7704897,7712213,1,0,hajile,,,"While I agree that the function &quot;has a name&quot;, the function is still anonymous in the sense that pointers don&#x27;t have types, only values have types.  As a side effect of converting church&#x27;s model to Turing&#x27;s model, all &quot;unnamed&quot; lambda functions are given one-time symbols as are all anonymous numbers, arrays, classes, objects, etc.<p><pre><code>  x = lambda x: x+x #a lambda, but has a named pointer\n  x = 5\n</code></pre>\nlambda is still in memory (until garbage collection), but it no longer has a pointer to it.<p><pre><code>  def x(y):\n    return y+y\n  \n  x = 5 #the &quot;named&quot; function above is now without a pointer\n</code></pre>\nA little off-topic (but answers your previous question and perhaps looks a little deeper into lambdas), but let&#x27;s take a quick look at javascript. JS developers use lambda functions both because lexical closures don&#x27;t pollute the global namespace, they offer modules and alternatives to prototypal objects, and because the language tends to make heavy use of callbacks (which demonstrate the bad side of lambda functions). JS also only makes subtle differences between lambdas and named functions.<p><pre><code>  //lambda expression\n  var x = function (){};\n\n  //named function\n  function x() {}\n\n  //named lambda expression\n  var x = function x() {};\n\n  //self-executing lambda (returns 5)\n  (function (x) {return x;}(5));\n</code></pre>\nnote that this would be a self-executing lambda in python<p><pre><code>  (lambda x: x)(5)\n</code></pre>\nbasic module pattern using self-executing lambda<p><pre><code>  my_module = (function (self) {\n    &quot;use strict&quot;\n    self = self || {};\n\n    //private\n    //pretty much inaccessible to the outside scope\n    var privateVar = 5;\n    //lambda expression again\n    var privateFunc = function () {};\n\n    //public\n    self.publicVar = 5;\n    self.publicFunc = function () {};\n    self.getPrivateVar = function () {\n      return privateVar;\n    };\n\n    return self;\n  }(my_module));\n\n  my_module.publicVar = 8;\n  my_module.publicFunc();\n  my_module.getPrivateVar();\n</code></pre>\nThis is where too many lambdas becomes a problem. Judicious use of naming (even though they&#x27;re only used once) makes things more legible.<p><pre><code>  func1(function () {\n    func2(function () {\n      func3(function () {\n        func4(function () {\n      })\n    })\n  })</code></pre>",1399492959

9289508,comment,9288681,9289428,0,0,treehau5,,,"This is really important to understand that people often miss. Tipping to me is way more than just some subjective criteria that I use to judge whether or not a server &quot;deserves&quot; a certain percentage. Maybe your service at that particular night was off. Sorry to hear that. Here is why you should still leave at least a decent tip. 1. Word will spread around the wait staff that you are a good tipper, even if the particular bad server you happened to receive that night didn&#x27;t spread it -- other servers will take note: &quot;Wow, even Josh got 15% from that guy&quot; 2. Once Word spreads, that&#x27;s when the preferential treatment starts. Stronger drinks, larger portions on your side items, extra samples. You always want to establish a relationship at your favorite restaurant. Get to know the managers. They love regulars, and then next time, even they will make sure your service is 100%. It really is a win-win.",1427723991

I&#x27;ve experimented with my rates over time, and am at a point where I have trouble finding work if I raise them...but become part of the &quot;commodity freelancer market&quot; if I charge less.<p>Last year, I had a client (who had their own client...which we&#x27;ll call the &quot;true client&quot;) for a big project. At the beginning of the project, upon receiving my quote, my client told me that it was &quot;way above&quot; what the true client was willing to pay. I asked for more clear budget numbers, and was told very clearly that it was 60% of my original quote. After days of negotiations, I ended up reducing my quote considerably. Keep in mind, this did NOT involve me reducing my rate; I know better.<p>Part-way through the project, I found out that not only was my original quote under the true client&#x27;s budget, but my client had also quoted them a price which was 3 times my original quote amount. Not only that...but they had used my quote to create their own, and then proceeded to cut me down farther.<p>I felt undervalued and belittled by the news. I wasn&#x27;t upset about another company profiting off of me (of course that&#x27;s going to happen by default, if I&#x27;m working through an intermediary). Rather, I was really bothered by the nickel-and-diming and flat-out lies I was told about the project&#x27;s constraints and budget.<p>Since that time, I&#x27;ve paid closer attention to the companies I work with. They&#x27;re consistently profiting off of me at ridiculous rates; however, if I raise my rates to compensate, I don&#x27;t get work. I&#x27;ve tried to form my own &quot;digital agency&quot; with another partner...but we had a harder time finding work as a new agency than as freelancers.<p><i></i>TL;DR:<i></i> I&#x27;m tired of being nickel-and-dimed, and want to move beyond the &quot;freelancer&quot; title. How did you become the digital agency that you are today? How did you drop the &quot;freelancer&quot; title and make something more of your daily life?",1427723887

I think that there must be some sort of correlation between people who thing that they are <i>owed</i> the tip no matter what level of service they give, and people that don&#x27;t give a damn about the service that they provide.<p>[1] In the US (and Canada), it is &#x27;customary&#x27; to tip larger for a large group of people. Many restaurants automatically add 18+% gratuity to the bill for groups of 8+ people. In this instance, the restaurant/bar did not do this, and the waitress gave us very poor service (e.g. disappeared for long periods of time). On the way out she complained that it&#x27;s customary to tip 18% for large groups (in a sarcastic, &quot;you&#x27;re a bunch of assholes&quot; tone). My wife (who has been a waitress) fired back that maybe she should talk to her manager about making it gratuity mandatory for large groups then.",1427723727

Anecdotally, think of times at high school when a teacher has put on a video: it&#x27;s typically to distract the students so that the teacher can have some time out from interacting. It has a similar function to leaving a baby in front of The Happy Little Elves. It&#x27;s better than having no stimulus, but no serious learning is expected from that.<p>Although the article says &quot;Watching videos is not better (or worse) than sitting through lectures&quot;, I would even disagree with that.

Content expecting the dictionary would need to be labelled as such anyway, so ad a dictionary number to that label. If the client didn&#x27;t already have that dictionary then it would be an extra HTTP request to get it that once but it would always have it for future use (or for smaller devices you might only hold a portion of the collection in a round-robin manner).<p>Of course someone would have to make the dictionaries, and everyone and his dog would prefer a different set so standardising could be an issue (if there were several &quot;standards&quot; the footprint would grow significantly). You would want a selection optimised for HTML, a selection for CSS, a selection for Javascript, some for English text, and some for other common languages (natural or technical). When compressing you would either need to pick one of the options arbitrarily (for HTML always use dictionary 3, for instance) or try with several and pick the best (which would be CPU intensive for dynamic content though the results could be cached for static). Clients would need to state they supported the new format, and servers would need to be able to serve content not requiring it as needed, servers would also need to host the dictionaries as you don&#x27;t want to be adding an extra external point of failure. Oh, and now you have the global presets on each host there would need to be some way of protecting against pollution due to reasons of accidental damage (simple on-disk or in-transit corruption), malicious intent (a DoS attempt), or stupidity (some one deciding it&#x27;ll be fine to use an as yet unallocated standard preset ID for something more local).<p>To get around the &quot;standard set&quot; issue in some cases you could perhaps support local standards (so the server could ask for &quot;prime the dictionary with local block 5&quot; instead of &quot;prime the dictionary with standard block 123&quot; and have these preset dictionaries cached and expired just like any other other object read over HTTP)<p>So while fraught with potential problems it is not an idea without merit - something practical could be gained, though there is debate to be had on whether the effort is worth while. I suspect it wouldn&#x27;t be, but if I won a lottery and had free time on my hands I might be interested to play with the idea further!<p>EDIT:<p>Having actually read the article, the local dictionaries method is very similar to what Google do with SDCH. I wonder if other browsers will ever bother to support it... For dynamically loaded content you could implement it yourself in javascript but that would kill external indexing so would be a problem for content you care about SEO and similar regarding (it could be useful for page/site 3rd party comment services though, and others that that already load all their content that way).",1427722847

Nobody wants to reinvent a REST client, deal with errors, timeouts, data conversion and how to match the API with actual use cases.<p>Especially when evaluating a new service, the last thing you want is have to read an API documentation before being able to do anything with the service.<p>Take MySQL. The protocol is all binary, and mostly undocumented. Yet, it&#x27;s used everywhere because the MySQL maintainers are shipping a C library on top on which people built bindings.<p>Same for MongoDB. Even though there are alternative/additional client libraries, they are maintaining client libraries for many languages. Getting started with MongoDB is easy; one doesn&#x27;t have to read an API documentation at all.<p>What if changes have to be made to the API? If the same team maintains the reference client libraries, it can be totally transparent to users. If you expect people to write their own client, it will be painful.<p>Please provide good reference client libraries so that people can immediately use the service, even before thinking about API documentation. And writing client libraries is also a good way to realize what&#x27;s broken/inconvenient in the API.",1427722791

It can take ages to get served, I&#x27;ll often request something when food is first brought and don&#x27;t receive it until I&#x27;m already done with my meal, etc. Part of this is certainly related to the laid back attitude of Latin America cultures, but if the service employees were incentivized to give better service they probably wouldn&#x27;t stand around talking to each other for 15 minutes while my friends and I are waiting on another beer.<p>Now I do hate that in the States there are now tip jars at all sorts of establishments, but to me restaurants and bars I much prefer tipping culture.",1427722229

I&#x27;d agree then that your word is correct.<p>You&#x27;re right in that expertise in getting contracts often has a tendency to displace expertise in IT. This has been a persistent problem in hiring. Contractors need to fill billets that come with mandatory requirements dictated by the government. Skilled individuals are often bypassed because they lack a certain certification (often unrelated to their work) or a certain parameter. In defense, security clearances can be an enormous barrier by limiting only those who possess a clearance as eligible. (There&#x27;s an &quot;insidious&quot; effect whereby you must be on or joining a project that requires a clearance to get a clearance, and you cannot join a cleared project without a clearance.) Pay is often much lower than compared to the private sector when compared to the industry as a whole, but since the layout of the federal government is separate than what drives the private IT industry, it creates opportunities for many where a grassroots IT industry wouldn&#x27;t otherwise exist.<p>There are good people who enter the environment and make positive change, but they are few. There are many more who work at a perfectly capable level and do the best they can, but would be considered underqualified for their role.

9289227,comment,9286906,9288895,0,0,brandonb,,,"Short answer: no real security issues. AWS itself runs everything from credit card processors to hospital software, they have great documentation on how to design your system so that you comply with the major certifications like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and FedRAMP:
  <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/</a>
  <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp-faqs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp-faqs/</a><p>Our security audit was apparently the first one in years to pass with no &quot;high findings&quot; (high-priority security issues that must be fixed before the system is approved to go live).<p>The main barrier we ran into was that although AWS was already FedRAMP-certified, it had not gone through CMS&#x27;s own internal security review process, which requires hundreds of pages of additional documentation and an audit of the code, team, and penetration testing of the live system. At the end of that process, you get an Authority to Operate, or ATO, and that&#x27;s what every site in the government legally must have in order to launch.<p>You can get a sense of how much paperwork is involved here:
<a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/downloads/ATO_Package_Guide.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-...</a><p>Navigating this ATO process was the single largest roadblock in developing the various parts of healthcare.gov 2.0. It meant that what we expected to take two months ended up taking more like eight.<p>The good news is that once we had gotten an ATO for AWS [1], any project within CMS--not just healthcare.gov--could start using AWS. [2] And within weeks of the ATO, we started hearing about other groups building their new projects on AWS, including Accenture, who&#x27;s now the primary healthcare.gov contractor.<p>And that also means that if a startup wants to work with CMS, rather than the typical set of DC contractors, now they can use AWS too and have one fewer barrier keeping them out of the system.<p>[1] as a small technical point, we split the ATO into &quot;infrastructure&quot; and &quot;application&quot; portions so that the infrastructure (AWS) portion could be reused.<p>[2] If you&#x27;re wondering why it matters that the government can use AWS, it&#x27;s because most data centers that cater to the government are really terrible. In the initial data center used for healthcare.gov, the way you provisioned a new server was to send a word document to a sales representative, listing the unix packages you want installed, and then a few weeks later they would give you a virtual machine which may or may not have what you asked for. You can&#x27;t be agile at all in that type of environment, and you certainly can&#x27;t do DevOps well because you can&#x27;t script anything.",1427721336

Plenty of companies have done it as a one-off thing. This is for either testing UAV systems or using the plane as a crash test vehicle. This usually involves the same team of engineers that equipped the aircraft monitoring every single parameter in real time. The military has actually received criticism for conducting weapon systems &#x27;tests&#x27; in this manner.<p>There is a huge difference between that and commercial operations of such a system. In a commercial environment, you can&#x27;t have a team of engineers on constant standby. For planes flying for research purposes over unoccupied areas a high risk of total loss of control is completely acceptable. Commercial and military remote control aircraft all have systems that intentionally crash the vehicle if communications is lost and it leaves a designated area. This prevents potential loss of life due to mundane software bugs.

Therefore, it has tons of code organized in an arcane way you won&#x27;t understand until you know <i>what problems it&#x27;s trying to solve</i>.<p>That&#x27;s why I always found teaching RoR (or equivalent frameworks in your language of choice) to beginners completely backwards. What the newcomer learns is how to tweak this huge blob of arcane magic here and there, and gains almost zero actual understanding of how things work. My preferred way of teaching webdev is showing how text goes from server to browser, how the browser parses it to render a page, and how a programming language is used to generate such text. And then I build up from this base. Sure, this approach won&#x27;t make one a Rockstar Full-Stack Code Ninja in half a week, but at least the student has some solid foundation of understanding to work from and can comprehend <i>why</i> Rails looks the way it looks.<p>It also seems to me that the current trend in web development is people using huge complex tools, of which they need 1% and understand 0.1%, and thus generating layers upon layers of bloat.

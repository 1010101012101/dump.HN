So, some 13 year old may be sent on a path towards becoming an auto mechanic, while another is guided off to become a surgeon or some other professional.  I'm sure there are ways to break out of your track, but there is a big formalized system working against you.<p>In the US, someone can spend all of high school in auto shop, and still have a chance of changing directions and ending up with a successful career at 33 that some bureaucrat never would never have predicted 20 years earlier.  If may take him longer than the kid whose parents and teachers were guiding them towards medicine or business from age 13, but the doors are open.<p>I think this is a strength of the US, both economically, and with respect to various liberal, democratic, egalitarian ideals.  It isn't perfect though.  There are certainly people would be happier and better off if they started learning a trade at an earlier age.  ",1189271863

I see a lot of very rich functionality (a good thing), but are they sure users really want/need all of that at this point? <p>It looks good already guys, you should let everyone else start using it",1189270849

1233385,comment,1229961,1231201,0,0,btilly,,,"The list of characteristics you are pulling out is different than the list the OP listed.  Which are competitiveness, aggression, focus on the game, and fair play.  (I score 1/4, I have a strong sense of fair play.)  And my opinion about the OP is based on comparing the characteristics that mattered to him versus my professional knowledge of what matters in software development.<p>As for your opinions of me, you're projecting from rather limited data.  Let me give you some more data points.  3 of my last 5 jobs were at small to medium startups.  (I was only at the 4th for a few months before getting an offer from Google, which is the 5th.)  Of those one sold for about $80 million, one sold for over $400 million, and one is getting by reasonably well.  (Admittedly it won't sell for anything like the valuations of the others.)  Now it is impossible to say what the contribution of any one person is to a gelled team, so there is no reasonable way of quantifying my individual contribution.  But the two that sold sold for around $4 million/employee, and the founders of all three would be happy to write me a glowing recommendation any time I asked saying that they thought I was a key part of their teams.<p>Furthermore if I was unwilling to participate in something new, then I wouldn't have jumped at a job at Google, working with a whole mess of technologies that I've never worked with before.<p>I submit that a process for hiring developers that won't even <i>consider</i> people like me is somewhat flawed.",1270079837

1233383,comment,1232776,1233257,0,0,lmkg,,,"So, what's going on, is that one of the dimensions in the game world is getting switched out for a fourth dimension. The visual transformation that you see isn't very clear about what's going on, and I guess it's basically not possible to be clear about this in a rectilinear coordinate system.<p>I'll try to explain. At 0:12, the game world has 3 axis, aligned with the sides of the blocks. By convention, let's say the vertical axis is the Z-axis, that the one going up and to the right (on the screen) is the X-axis, and the one going up and to the left is the Y axis. There's also a ""hidden"" axis, which I'll call the W-axis, which can't be displayed (for obvious reasons).<p>At 0:13, the player switches out the Y-axis for the W-axis. We can no longer see the extent of objects in the Y direction. However, we can now see the extent of objects in the W-axis direction. For example, in the XY-plane, the ground was all green, but in the XW-plane it looks stripped with green and brown. This means there are a series of XY-planes sitting ""next to"" each other in W-space, alternating in colors. The character was originally sitting on one of the green ones. Now that the Y-axis was switched for the X-axis, we see X-axis ""slices"" of these XY-planes, arranged along the W-axis.<p>Note that the big rock structure is located on the W-axis only in the XYZ 3-D ""slice"" that the character originally occupied. The character then proceeds to move the wooden ring along the W-axis to a different XZ-slice, where the rock structure isn't in the way.<p>At 0:18, he switches axes back to the XYZ plane, although this isn't strictly necessary. You'll notice he's now on an XYZ slice that, in W-space, has brown ground. The rock structure isn't in the way because it's on a different location on W-axis than everything on-screen (it's displayed as transparent, for reference). He moves the structure along the X-axis, past the rock obstruction. He then switches back to XWZ-space, moves the wooden thing back along the W-axis again, and switches back to the original coordinate system.",1270079747

The tonal part goes up/down, let's say, one octave at a time and becomes louder or quieter. Pure whisper is essentially only the noise part. The separation routine should look into the spectrum: the tonal part must look like narrower bands, while the rest is noise. Tonal transformations may be more complex in reality than just multiplication, but the simplest transformation might work OK too.",1270079721

I don't buy the scenario that she got eight well-written, nice, well-targeted messages in a single day and didn't get at least that many messages from jerks.  Unless she's got some kind of bizarrely good filtering set up, or is on a really, really niche site, those kinds of messages outnumber the earnest well-spoken ones.  This is a case where tidying up an anecdote for dramatic effect completely changes its meaning.  Her comment was probably aimed at the real losers in her inbox rather than the appealing ones mentioned in the story.<p>Plus, for a woman, being on a dating site is all about volume control.  She probably only has time to go out with one new guy every week or month, so she picks the best guy out of the dozens of men who contact her every week. The rest are just noise. They're a boring and pointless part of her day.

Instead, I carried on a conversation and ended up speaking to him for over 2 hours. Discovered that I, a liberal, borderline hippie could easily converse with a former soldier who just came back from Iraq, on various political topics no less!<p>It was because we were both immediately open with each other, we were able to get along and have a great conversation despite each of our flaws (his gawking, my arrogance).<p>If someone writes you a sincere letter, I don't care how many of those you get, I hope you have the decency to reply, even if it's just to say that you're not interested. If you can't handle it, then what, may I ask, are you doing on that dating site in the first place?",1270077438

1233313,comment,1230768,1231844,0,0,derefr,,,"RDBMSes, of course, <i>don't have</i> hierarchically-organized ""resources."" That's the whole point of the ""R"" in there. However, <i>the rest</i> of the URL format still applies to them. The resource and query-parameter parts of the URL are indeed ""a binary blob""—but that doesn't matter. Why?<p>The great thing about URLs, within a protocol like HTTP, is that they're <i>discoverable</i>—if the protocol associated with your schema guarantees some sort of non-destructive querying operation on a resource (ala a GET or HEAD operation), then you can retrieve the / resource of a server to get a <i>sitemap</i>, and use the further, hyperlinked URLs to find all of the site's resources in turn. You're <i>supposed</i> to treat the resource and query parameter parts of the URL as a binary blob; they're a token you give to the server to get other tokens.<p>URLs let you turn a your meaningless binary blob—a.k.a. a URN—into a (where to ask, what to ask for, who I am) triple. This is a useful thing, even if the ""what to ask for"" part is still opaque! It means that you can always <i>dereference</i> a URL starting from the Internet as a whole, whereas with a URN the ""where to ask"" part has to be figured out on your own. If you combine this with a discoverable protocol, you enable your URLs to be <i>spidered</i> and thus <i>indexed</i>—and then they can all be found <i>and used</i> by anyone who has a single graph edge pointing into your site. That's way better than, say, an ISBN number, isn't it?<p>""mailto"" and ""file"" and those other ones you mentioned <i>aren't</i> URLs, <i>as the term is commonly used</i>. They are, in practce, URNs—they consist of a schema (namespace identifier) and an opaque blob. They <i>don't</i> decompose into a (where to ask, what to ask for, who I am) triple.<p>URLs are amazing, but to <i>call</i> something a URL, it has to already <i>be</i> uniform, and to decompose into one of those triples. So the original article was silly (see the sqlite3 example—that's a URN right there)—but at the same time correct. <i>Use URLs to locate your resources.</i> Just don't make something up and <i>call</i> it a URL; do the actual work of having a standard, uniform string that has a resource and a location in it. And if you don't have the weight to make your own standard and make everyone treat it as uniform? <i>Use someone else's</i>. Use HTTP, even! REST is basically people realizing HTTP guarantees nice things about URLs and taking advantage of that.",1270077008

After all, you can disable it if you don't like it, but having it off just increases your vulnerability to another kind of privacy problem.<p>It is a similar problem to OCSP vs. CRLs for X.509 (SSL/TLS) certificates. CRLs are better for the end-user's privacy in the sense that the protocol doesn't tell the CA what websites the user is actually browsing, while OCSP (as implemented today) does. But, OCSP allows something more like real-time certificate status checks, and CRL information will almost always be more out of date.",1270076851

I feel like they've done a decent job in LA and they're improving constantly (faster and faster 3g it seems), and they're about on par if not better than the service I get from Verizon. I don't know that many iPhone users in LA that are angry at AT&T. Only if they can't get service in their homes, or if there's some major outage...happens occasionally, but not enough to be a serious bother.<p>That being said, I go up to San Francisco like once a month, and up there my calls exceeding 1 minute drop at an alarming near-100% rate, my text messages are delayed, half my phone calls can't even be received, location services never works because data never works, and if I can't even get GPRS, there goes all my email and more. It's a complete wreck and I can totally understand the AT&T griping then.<p>Part of me thinks that Apple is caving in here to AT&T's requests because the level of service AT&T is providing is hurting Apple because a lot of people are refusing to buy or are no longer buying iPhones because of AT&T. Also because for AT&T to upgrade their network, it will take time, and these little changes can make a big difference while we're waiting for these upgrades to happen (now, whether or not AT&T is actually upgrading their network is a different question....).<p>Lastly, I feel that this kind of situation is one that any carrier would have run into if they had a phone like the iPhone available on their network. It's not just any smartphone, it's a smartphone that changes the usage habits of the users, and changing the user experience of what these users are looking at...no wonder we're all using more data.

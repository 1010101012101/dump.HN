3143378,comment,3143319,3143319,3,0,caw,,,">why don't CS degrees teach you much technical skills? Seems more theory than anything else!<p>Because the theory lasts a heck of a lot longer than the technical skills.  They're giving you the tools to learn anything rather than teach you something.<p>>How can I change this, and what tips, advice, etc would you give to someone like me?<p>>Is this normal? Can someone who has gotten a CS degree elaborate on this?<p>Build something, get an internship, or freelance.  I know that a couple of people at my school would subcontract to other guys as they were trying to launch products. A couple of disclaimers on that.  1) Everyone at school thinks that ideas are worth $ and will try to steal it from you rather than work with you if you ask the wrong person.  2) If you have an idea rather than a problem you're not going to be making money off of it, but it still might be good experience if you did it as an open source program or something.<p>What I ended up doing was helping to build a webapp at work, and my senior design was a webapp. Senior design was much more rigid in terms of agile methodologies and spec writing.  Additionally, a friend of mine had hired me to write some scripts for him to automate some of his business tasks.  I earned enough money out of a couple of projects to mostly finance a Macbook. My friend worked with me and had me write a proposal for every project before I started so that was good practice as well.",1319284576

That's the thing that lists your wireless networks etc.<p>Although I don't use the menu's that often, and I hate digging down into menus - I find they are really useful for reminding myself quickly which programs I have installed.

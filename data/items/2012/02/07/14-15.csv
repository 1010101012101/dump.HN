In short, this is due to the introduction of commercially available formula milk, and breastfeeding becoming ""unfashionable"". As you probably know, breastmilk is the very best thing that you can give a baby, it has a ridiculous amount of benefits.<p>In order for more women to choose to breastfeeding over formula feeding it needs to become normalised again. In order to normalise breastfeeding people have to be exposed to it more so that it is not weird and so that they are not shocked by it. It should not be a private thing, it should be a sociable thing like it is in many other countries around the world.<p>They don't remove pictures of women flashing all of their cleavage or prancing around in pants with their hands over their boobs. THAT is offensive (and slightly slutty). Breastfeeding is definetely not.<p>Breastfeeders are angry because they feel that by banning images of breastfeeding women (most of which don't even feature nipples) facebook is communicating the wrong moral messages. As facebook has such a large impact on society, it is very important that they play their part in helping to promote breastfeeding, and not making it seem an offensive & disgusting thing that should be censored.

I'm not disillusioned by joining these services since I completely understand I have to play within their rules.

That's perfectly aligned with the goal of ""Data Loss Prevention"" - the customer wanted to catch employees stealing corporate data, and didn't want them to know that they were being spied on.<p>I'd argue that this behavior is much worse than simple sloppiness, because the CA is making a conscious business decision that puts the integrity of the PKI system at risk.

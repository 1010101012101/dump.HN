As a college student with a Windows Phone, however, I can attest anecdotally both to the operating system's (mostly the UI's) popular appeal and, on the other hand, to widespread popular distaste for the brand itself.<p>With other, tech-ignorant college students as my data points, I have found that most people's first impressions of the OS are quite positive, ranging from ""oh, that phone's nice"" (and they aren't talking about the physical device, a bland, somewhat chubby HTC Trophy) to ""that's the coolest phone I've ever seen."" As mentioned, these aren't people into tech I'm talking about—most of them have iPhones because they wanted one, or everyone else has one, or because there parents got them, so they did, too. I thus do not actively promote my phone in any way—all I've been doing, when I've gotten these sorts of responses, has been showing someone what someone else texted me, or some other datum or whatnot.<p>When they inevitably ask—""what kind of phone is that?""—and I say ""Windows Phone,"" they, just as inevitably, immediately lose all interest.<p>This may parallel, I suppose, the reason Xbox, for example, remains instead successful years after its introduction: one of my uncles called my dad on Christmas day this year concering some computer or network problem (my dad, as a software engineer, of course bears that burden in our family), and mentioned incidentally that he had gotten my cousin an Xbox as a gift. My dad, who used to work for Microsoft and still gets a discount on their software, suggested that he might have been able to save some cash had my uncle told him ahead of time, or that he could still save on games if he wanted. What did my uncle say, however, but ""oh, I didn't know it [Xbox] was Microsoft."" Indeed, my uncle to this day refers to Microsft in conversation with my dad as ""the evil empire.""<p>So yeah, I think the brand name itself, however irrational the reason, hasn't helped at all. Also, there isn't a single actual window in the Windows Phone OS... Time to change up the name.",1325645429

It now costs anywhere from $1500-2000/m2 to build a house.<p>That's <i>insane</i>.<p>That cost is then passed on through wage demands, the cost of running any business and so on. Rent is at or above New York levels (my old apartment in West Perth is now more expensive than my apartment in <i>Manhattan</i>).<p>Apart from roughly comparable rent in NYC, <i>everything</i> else is significantly cheaper.<p>Increased population pressure, property prices and construction costs are also reflected in the skyrocketing price increases in food, water and power.<p>London is (or at least was the last time I visited) reasonably expensive.<p>Zurich has a reputation for being expensive but honestly it's not anymore. Fact is, you can still get a studio in the city for maybe under CHF1000/month (something you can't in Perth). Yes food is more expensive but you pay lower taxes and everything else is, at worst, comparable in cost. I look at property prices in nice towns like Zug or Luzern and (IMHO) it's way more affordable than Perth.<p>So ignore whatever the CPI tells you about Australia. IMHO it's not a place you want to live now unless you have owned property for at least 10 years (and thus rode the property boom and are reasonably cashed up) or are rich.

3422495,comment,3421190,3421190,0,0,algoshift,,,"Right.  One of the rules is ""be nice"".<p>OK.  This article is flawed and many of the comments are just as flawed.  Having been involved in the design and manufacturing of LCD displays (down to writing all FPGA image processing code, scaling, deinterlacing, etc.) I think I can say that none of this is accurate if the intent is to apply it generally.<p>Caveat:  If you buy a TV don't expect it to be a computer monitor.  Most TV designs are just that: TV sets.  They are made to do one thing reasonably well:  Take a crappy satellite/cable/whatever signal and give you a reasonable image back.<p>EDID can be programmed with any resolution you want.  Do you need 921 x 333 at 12 frames per second?  No problem.  There is no such thing as a resolution not being available in EDID.  Standards are one thing, but the EDID mechanism isn't inherently limited by standards.<p>BTW, there are commercially available EDID modifier gadgets that allow you to modify the EDID readout from the monitor.  So, the monitor says one thing and your computer (or whatever device) receives your programmed values.<p>If you need a TV that will play nice with a computer you need to find one that was explicitly designed to do so.<p>Most consumer TVs use one of a very few commercially available processor chips to do their image processing.  With a few exceptions they all do the same kinds of things.  And no, the signals are rarely converted to YCbCr 4:2:2 internally but for the absolute cheapest and crappiest of processors.  All the good ones convert the input to a common internal integer RGB format.  The nice ones might standardize at 12 bits per channel (36 bits total) internally.  When I did custom FPGA video processing we went as far as 24 bits per channel in order to avoid truncation of calculated values until the very last moment.  This can make a huge difference depending on the application.<p>In general terms ""monitor mode"", if you will, should be a mode that bypasses as much of the internal processing as possible.  You can force this bypass by using and EDID modifier gadget programmed for the actual resolution and timings of the panel.  In other words, open the back of the TV, get the panel model number, get the data-sheet and program the EDID modifier to output these values to your computer.  The processor should push this straight to the panel and you get very little, if any, processing.  Again, this does not work on all TVs.  As I said before, they are designed to be TVs, not monitors.<p>That said, I've connected many computers to off-the-shelf, un-modified, consumer TVs via DVI and HDMI.  I have yet to run into any real issues.",1325645025
3422494,comment,3421843,3422351,0,0,Stormbringer,,,"It's more that there are large numbers of people who consistently don't get humour, either for cultural reasons or deficiencies in their humour glands or whatever.<p>On the other hand, in forums where people upvote humour, there can be mechanisms that actually are counterproductive.  E.g. on Reddit where there is something serious that you are interested in, but some idiot starts a punning thread which takes off and runs for pages.  Or slashdot, where a witty one line (simplistic) put down off a complex issue will recieve maximum karma, whereas a well thought out retort will struggle to break the readability threshold.<p>Hacker News has a number of mechanisms for impeding flame-wars, and I think some of them also impede the flow of humour.  No fast replies for instance slows things down, and also the depth algorithm because PG doesn't like deep threads.  Another one is de-emphasising karma.  If people hand out karma for being entertained, then the system 'rewards' you for being entertaining, so again people go for the slashdot style one-off witty put down.<p>On the gripping hand, now that HN de-emphsises karma (and has weird rules about what can and cannot be down-voted), I'm much less likely to actually bother.  Karma is already pointless, but rubbing our faces in it simply reduces participation.  The ideal system would 'reward' well thought out replies, and I don't see the current system doing that anytime soon.<p>On the invisible hand humour is an important part of geek culture, as are references to things such as invisible hands and gripping hands.  I'm not sure why that is, but word-play and recursion (important parts of being a really clever programmer) are already pretty close to humour, or possibly even forming some of the foundations of it.<p>Which leads me to conjecture that all of the really good programmers have a healthy sense of humour, and that implies that if hacker news is overrun with people who don't have a good sense of humour, that would indicate the ratio of good programmers here is falling.  Why would that be?  Perhaps because of the emphasis on money, and winning the startup lottery.  The programmers who are only in it for the money tend to view themselves as more 'serious' - so I suspect they are the source of the ""humourless git"" demographic.",1325645024

Yes, it's not good dreaming all the day, losing your main concentration and naming your baby when you're in high school. But I think there is nothing bad naming your baby if your wife is already pregnant. After naming you're starting to think that you did 10% of your startup work and it starts to motivate you to go on. I am a designer founder, I founded 3 startups, I always build the product on a paper, design it, calculate the possible progress of the startup, than naming, buying the domain, branding, ui/ux design and hiring a dev to build my prototype.",1325644899

This would be the typical case that their policy was designed to weed out, and Google's webspam department would have no reason to be lenient. And they likely wouldn't.<p>The second situation is when another department at Google appears to violate the Google webspam rules. Someone from Google webspam would see that Google Chrome is in violation, and of course they would feel the need to be lenient. Sure, it's a big company, but I'm sure any employee would assume they could work things out with the Chrome department.<p>This would just end up being the exact situation we've seen unfold today: Google Chrome would appear to get a pass, while the ""obvious spammers"" would be punished normally.

3422469,comment,3421313,3421593,0,0,shorttime,,,"I lived in NYC for a bit so I'll tell you what I liked and what I didn't.<p>One of the things I liked the most was the subway and public transportation system.  I didn't have a car at the time and the system was relatively cheap.  The system allowed me to get back and forth to my job everyday while also enabling me to head down to Manhattan or other boroughs (I was in Queens) for fun.  While it did take time, I had time to spare, but not much money so it worked.<p>The people.  NYC has a very diverse set of people, like in many other large cities.  In NYC, you can meet anyone, with a broad range of cultures, but you are in control of your own destiny.  In my experience, nobody (most) talked to anyone unless they knew someone ahead of time.  It was a funny feeling at first, people would be sitting directly across from each other (6 feet/2 meters) - totally ignoring each others' existence.  But! If you were interested in getting to know someone you could, most people were receptive when talked to.  Sure, there are a few assholes, but there's always assholes in the group.  Included in this are roommates, if you manage to get a good set of roommates while there, that's awesome.  If you don't, you can always move. I was lucky in this respect.<p>NYC has pretty much everything you could want to do, plays, movies, museums, beaches, ice skating, gyms, martial arts, the list goes on except mountain stuff, and even then it's within traveling distance.  I enjoy snowboarding so that's one of my main reasons for not wanting to live there.  I don't have the time to travel that much anymore, unfortunately.<p>NYC has a huge mount of opportunity in most industries if you're looking for a job.  You just have to reach out and capture it, nobody will hand it to you (usually).<p>The things I didn't like...<p>The perception of certain areas.  The Bronx, Harlem, some parts of Brooklyn and Queens have bad reputations.  Some of it is true but mostly not.  There are lot of things in these areas you wouldn't see elsewhere in NYC.  I feel you wouldn't get an accurate portrayal of NYC if you didn't go to these areas.  The key is to not go out asking for trouble by flashing money around or causing people grief (making people look stupid).  Walk confidently and with purpose and you won't usually have an issue.  I also wouldn't go wandering around these areas in the dark after drinking either.<p>Initially, I hated the in-your-face sales approaches that vendors typically use.  I got used to it, again, act confidently and don't let them take your money unless you really want what they're selling.<p>I'm not sure how grocery stores in Norway work but NYC is nothing like I ever knew.  It was tough getting to them and even then, it was often public market or corner store food.  It is somewhat expensive.  Wholesale stores typically have better deals, if you can find one (BJs, Costco, Sam's Club, etc).<p>After awhile I started missing having a front yard to play with my dogs in.  I didn't have much of a yard at the apartments I lived at.<p>It was a very valuable experience.  It helped me grow as a person and helped me learn many different things.  If I had to do it over again, I would.<p>That's it for now; if you have any questions feel free to ask me.  Good luck in your travels.",1325644626

Luckily, I haven't had an issue where the buyer got the item and wanted a refund, so I have no idea how it would go.<p>I guess as a seller in the Etsy community, I've heard so many shitty buyer stories, I tend to side with the seller. Everything from a simple claiming the item was never received when it actually was, to all sorts of bizarre schemes by buyers to get extra money out of the deal.<p>Regardless, PayPal should have gotten an actual expert to check out the violin before ordering it destroyed.",1325643015

3422385,comment,3420184,3420455,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"That's an interesting look at things.  I look at it from something Stephen King wrote in On Writing.  Basically, the story was about his father/uncle/grand father who, when he needed to fix something, would bring out his entire tool box, with all his tools, despite only needing a hammer.  Stephen would ask him why he didn't <i>just</i> bring the hammer, and his reply was: ""Because, I didn't know what else I might need one I got out here.""  Basically, the story tells us to bring our toolbox with us.<p>When you look at a large framework like Zend, it's a lot to swallow.  There are a lot of parts, and just like the tools in a tool box, each plays a different part.  You might <i>just</i> need a hammer today, but tomorrow, you might need a screw driver, and then a saw, and then a sander.<p>So, I appreciate larger frameworks.  Sure, SOAP or XML-RPC might not be fun, but when that's the way you connect to the bank, it being apart of the framework makes it so much easier.<p>Anyways, the point was I saw your post, and it reminded me of Stephen's story.",1325642432

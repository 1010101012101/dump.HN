But I will explain how our process is and at what point we measure qualities.<p>1. Skill: we review his works in Github, Behance etc. If he made an application and release we will go through it also.<p>2. Knowledge: through interview<p>3. Quality: We will give him a one-week test task to make a small application using some web services like Flickr, Instagram etc.<p>4. Ownership & Collaboration: After reviewing the test task we will invite him to the office and work with the team on the real project. may be peer program with a developer.<p>This is a very long process but we got a better result from out old fashion of hiring. But Still @dsacco quote is very true, there is no universal sign for a good candidate.<p>Most of the candidates are like the yin-yang. but I had seen and inspired a lot of good managers who maintained the equilibrium in the team.

However, Rust already has enough safety mechanisms in place that integer overflow isn&#x27;t a memory safety concern, so the tradeoff is less clear-cut.<p>Note that the Rust developers <i>want</i> arithmetic to be checked, they&#x27;re just waiting for hardware to catch up to their liking. The Rust &quot;specification&quot; at the moment reserves the right to dynamically check for overflow in lieu of wrapping (Rust has long since provided types that are guaranteed to wrap for those occasions where you need that behavior).<p><pre><code>  > someone implemented integer overflow checks and found \n  > that the performance penalty was low, except for \n  > microbenchmarks.\n</code></pre>\nI was part of that conversation back then, and the results that I saw showed the opposite: the overhead was only something like 1% in microbenchmarks, but around 10% in larger programs. (I don&#x27;t have a link on hand, you&#x27;ll have to take this as hearsay for the moment.)",1451858363

This is a world of difference from, say, Australia, where the taxis are dirty, unsafe, and driven by a workforce that has a big stimulant drug-use problem (of course this is a generalisation, but I&#x27;ve caught enough taxis in Australia to come across all of this a few times, and it&#x27;s certainly not uncommon).<p>In other words, there are places like Australia that desperately need Uber and the competition it brings to taxi companies.

The amount depends on how long the employee has been in the company, as well as when the contract was signed (the legislation has changed and doesn&#x27;t apply retroactively).

So Amazon has that benefit over many other stores even if you do not pay for Prime.<p>Shipping prices generally are interesting. I get that shipping isn&#x27;t free, but often enough there really would be potential to optimize. E.g. Amazon ships what they can in small cardboard envelopes (stuff like USB drives, small cables, electronic parts, that kind of thing). Efficient and fast. Other sellers want 4.99 € shipping for that. Which, if I&#x27; buying stuff for 15-25 €, is a notable percentage of the price. (And yes, if you send me a big shipping box in which I have to dig through the packaging chips to find the product, then you probably paid close to that for shipping, but that really wasn&#x27;t necessary)<p>Or the one that also has stores, where you can either pay 5.99 € shipping or do store pickup. And I&#x27;m thinking &quot;eh, the price is a bit cheaper than everywhere else, but they want more shipping. BUT I can easily pick it up myself and maybe even get it a bit quicker.&quot;. Change the shipping method, and discover that it now charges me no shipping, but increased the product price by 5.99 €.

I apparently have what it takes to do rather better than rent-a-coder, but my business skills aren&#x27;t nearly enough to be &quot;opportunity cost profitable&quot;  -  I can make rent, but I&#x27;m not paying myself nearly what one of the local big companies would.  Hell, right now I&#x27;m contracting to one of the big companies, and spending the money getting my own company back up to snuff.  (and again, it&#x27;s an education.  Contractors, if you do the math, make about what &#x27;base salary&#x27; would be for the position as an employee.   A decade ago, this was also true... the difference being that a decade ago, base salary was pretty much total comp.   These days, bonuses and regular stock grants are the norm and make up a large part of compensation.   And if you are a contractor?  you don&#x27;t see that money... either it goes to the middleman or contractor bill rates haven&#x27;t risen with full time compensation.

I have a comfortable place in this economic system;  I&#x27;m certainly not at the top, but I&#x27;m pretty far from the bottom.

Uber-like services have been legal in Germany since pretty much forever (and many cities don&#x27;t even have a cap on medallions for a straight-up taxi service).

This license is actually pretty straightforward to get and runs only to a few hundred Euro (renewable after five years), and the requirements are reasonable (no criminal record, good health/vision, knowledge test). These costs are a pittance for a normal taxi business, but pretty steep for a private person who only wants to moonlight as a driver every so often.<p>Second, insurance.

One problem is that language implementations are imperfect and may have much higher overhead than necessary. An even bigger problem is that defaults matter. Most users of a language don&#x27;t consider integer overflow at all. They trust the language designers to make the default decision for them. I believe that most people would certainly choose overflow checks if they had a perfect implementation available, and perfect knowledge of the security and reliability implications (i.e. knowledge of all the future bugs that would result from overflow in their code), and carefully considered it and weighed all the options, but they don&#x27;t even think about it. And they shouldn&#x27;t have to!<p>For a language designer, considerations are different. Default integer overflow checks will hurt their benchmark scores (especially early in development when these things are set in stone while the implementation is still unoptimized), and benchmarks influence language adoption. So they choose the fast way. Similarly with hardware designers like you. Everyone is locally making decisions which are good for them, but the overall outcome is bad.",1451857574

If the new platform still uses the same internal identifiers for each piece of content, it may be as simple as a one-line apache httpd or nginx redirect, from `<a href=""http://example.com/get/thing/$ID`"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/get/thing/$ID`</a> to `<a href=""http://example.com/find/it/here/$ID`"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/find/it/here/$ID`</a> or whatever. If the internal identifiers have changed, it&#x27;s a pain to list the mapping -- but that pain doesn&#x27;t actually diminish much at all with this w3id.org service, you&#x27;re still going to have to update all the URLs individually with their service.<p>Another possibility is that your hostname has changed; as long as you haven&#x27;t lost the ownership of the old domain though, it is still not technically hard to point it to the same place as your new one, and then you&#x27;re reduced to the same situation as above.<p>So it&#x27;s not technically hard to provide the URL redirection yourself locally.  If you want to provide your own platform-idenpendent &quot;permanent identifiers&quot; from the start, there&#x27;s even several open source packages meant to help you do it yourself, locally.<p>On the other hand,it is another thing to think about, another thing to maintain and monitor. Nearly everything else one can think of, even things not that hard to do locally, especially if they might require running another service locally, is being &#x27;outsourced&#x27; to &quot;X As a Service&quot; platforms.<p>So, okay, why not &#x27;permanent&#x27; identifiers too?  I wish people would just take care of it themselves, the way the web was intended. And I wish w3id.org actually just identified themselves as &quot;permanent identifiers as a service&quot; or whatever, instead of implying that they&#x27;re doing something fundamentally different than plain old URL redirection you can do not too difficultly yourself.<p>And it is important to note that you are relying on the continued existence and maintenance of the w3id.org hostname and service behind it for &quot;permanence&quot;. When &quot;permanent&quot; is in the name, the risks of relying on an &quot;_ as a service&quot; provider are higher, you can&#x27;t really switch to a different provider later, you&#x27;re stuck with them literally forever, and counting on them existing as long as you need your identifiers to.<p>But it&#x27;s not too surprising if people are looking for &quot;permanent identifiers as a service&quot;, they&#x27;re looking for nearly everything as a service. On the other other hand, most entities don&#x27;t seem to care about permanence in their URI&#x27;s _at all_ -- if you are at the point where you realize it&#x27;s important, I&#x27;d think you&#x27;d be the kind of entity to have the technical capacity to implement it yourself locally too, and then have true local control over the &#x27;permanence&#x27; of identifiers, not have to rely on a third party continuing to be maintained.",1451857097

Relative wealth however retain its effect on happiness regardless of absolute wealth level. 2) Inequality distorts supply and demand in society. In any society there is a limit to labour. If you shift larger part of society&#x27;s wealth  to a few they will command an increasing share of the labour of a society. This will affect what gets produced in society and relative prices. 3) High concentrations of wealth distorts politics. With more equal distribution politicians will mainly cater to the interests of the majority of the people. With extreme wealth concentration society will become increasingly like an oligarchy. Studies show that this has already started to happen in the US. Studies show that what becomes actual practical politics is generally not in line with the will of the majority, but rather with the will of the wealthy few.<p>If you look at societies with high wealth concentrations like those with large oil wealth or other resource wealth you find typically very weak political institutions and poor development of democracy.

That&#x27;s where MailScope comes in. Each new subscriber you get, MailScope will automatically add firstname, lastname (and other profile data).<p>It&#x27;s just the start and I&#x27;ve been having great fun expanding the possibilities - alerting you when an &#x27;influencer&#x27; signs up so that you can reach out directly; auto-following subscribers on twitter when they signup. I&#x27;ve already got a dozen or so paying customers who use MailScope to enrich their mailing lists and increase their revenues.

Let me try to phrase it in a clearer way.<p>If you focus on reducing &quot;income inequality&quot; then you will reduce income inequality, but that will have many negative unintended consequences (killing startups at the extreme, etc). Instead, people should focus on the <i>REAL</i> problems which is lack of economic opportunity, crushing poverty, and political corruption.<p>The real solutions all come from helping the people at the lesser end of the inequality equation without having to touch many of the people at the greater end. Universal healthcare, universal education (day-care/pre-school/public schools/job retraining), universal basic income.

And my guess the money for these things already exists if you eliminate ridiculous wasteful spending, subsidies, etc.<p>If, at the end of day you eliminate wasteful spending and there is still a shortage of funds for these programs, then sure increase taxes on the wealthiest.

All of the no-brainer tradeoffs were picked clean decades ago, so all we&#x27;re left with are the ones that aren&#x27;t obvious wins. In general, if you look at a field an wonder why almost no one has done this super obvious thing for decades, maybe consider that it might be not so obvious after all. At zurn mentioned, there are actually a lot of places where you could get 5% and it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it. I&#x27;ve worked at two software companies that are large enough to politely ask Intel for new features and instructions; checked overflow isn&#x27;t even in the top 10 list of priorities, and possibly not even in the top 100.<p>In the thread you linked to, the penalty is observed to be between 1% and 5%, and even on integer heavy workloads, the penalty can be less than 1%, as demonstrated by the benchmark linked to above. Somehow, this has resulted in the question &quot;If you could make your processor 5% faster ...&quot;. But you&#x27;re not making your processor 5% faster across the board! That&#x27;s a completely different question, even if you totally ignore the cost of adding the check, which you are.<p>To turn the question around, if people aren&#x27;t willing to pay between 0% and 5% for the extra security provided, why should hardware manufacturers implement the feature? When I look at most code, there&#x27;s not just a 5% penalty, but a one to two order of magnitude penalty over what could be done in the limit with proper optimization. People pay those penalties all the time because they think it&#x27;s worth the tradeoff. And here, we&#x27;re talking about a penalty that might be 1% or 2% on average (keep in mind that many workloads aren&#x27;t integer heavy) that you don&#x27;t think is worth paying. What makes you think that people would who don&#x27;t care enough about security to pay that kind of performance penalty would pay extra for a microprocessor that gives has this fancy feature you want?",1451855922

On the other hand, the instruction listing of the base RISC-V ISA and the standard extensions can fit on a single powerpoint slide.<p><a href=""http://riscv.org/workshop-jun2015/riscv-intro-workshop-june2015.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://riscv.org/workshop-jun2015/riscv-intro-workshop-june2...</a><p>I wasn&#x27;t involved in any of the recent tape-outs, so I can&#x27;t say exactly how big the decoder is. But it&#x27;s quite small relative to the other chip components. Currently, the integer pipeline of the chip is roughly the same size as the FPU, and these two together are roughly the same size as the L1 cache. All of those components together are smaller than the L2 cache (depends on the size of the L2 cache, though). So decoder size doesn&#x27;t really matter in the grand scheme of things.<p>Decoder speed probably does matter, though. Currently, we can decode an instruction in a single cycle (1 ns). The x86 decoder, on the other hand, can take multiple cycles depending on instruction. But maybe this isn&#x27;t a fair comparison since the instructions are decomposed into uops.\nI have no idea about the performance of ARM decoders.",1451855331

Quite a few seem to use 12V 7AH SLA batteries frequently used in emergency lighting, which cost about $15-20 per online, if you&#x27;re willing to fuss with getting them bundled up and shoved back in tightly.<p>Many of the bigger rackmount UPSes have a big plug on the back to attach extra battery cabinets.  I wouldn&#x27;t get a big UPS without this feature.  They&#x27;ll let you hang whatever batteries you want off of the charger/inverter, as long as you get the voltage and charge rates right.  (Obviously we are in warranty-voiding territory here.)<p>I have a couple of old Tripp-Lites, bought basically at scrap value because the internal batteries were dead, and they use Anderson SB175 forklift-charger connectors on the back.  It works fine with just external batteries, giving you the advantage of being able to buy whatever SLAs happen to be cheap on the local market.  (Though I&#x27;d definitely want to make sure all 4 were purchased at the same time since you&#x27;re wiring them up together in a set.)",1451854900

Content may be either a file or a directory, which is a map of names to hashes.<p>In the higher level ipns namespace content is associated with the hash of its current content and the public key of the agent that&#x27;s allowed to update this hash.<p>A hypothetical that I found motivational:<p>The New York Times writes an article that includes a link to a source, say a scientific paper. As an organization, they make the decision to care about their articles being available with necessary context, so they link to the paper&#x27;s hash within IPFS and configure their servers to maintain and serve all IPFS content that they ever link to. In this way, even when the original host of the report goes offline the New York Times is able to ensure that their article&#x27;s links continue to work.",1451854891

10239939,comment,10236721,10239245,0,0,spankalee,,,"The work that the polyfills do: custom element registration and lifecycle, DOM composition, style encapsulation, is the same work that other frameworks do, they just do it in a proprietary way, and usually in a way that&#x27;s incompatible with normal DOM usage. Current frameworks are no more &quot;natively supported&quot; than the polyfills anyway - it&#x27;s all just code using the DOM.<p>Given that all browser vendors are implementing Shadow DOM now, and are very close to starting on custom elements, choosing the polyfill route means that in a couple of years you will be able to have less load time because the polyfills are unnecessary. It also means that your elements will be compatible with the ecosystem of web components, not just the proprietary component system of whichever framework you chose.<p>Plus, the model is actually quite simple: custom elements are just elements. That&#x27;s a big deal when using other libraries.<p>But you shifted reasoning between your comments. First you claimed that Polymer wasn&#x27;t supported on any browser but Chrome, which is false (though I do think that the compatibility page isn&#x27;t clear enough), then you question whether polyfills are worth it. As always, if you&#x27;re looking for reasons to not use something, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find them - that goes for any library or framework.",1442591921

10239925,comment,10238690,10238830,0,0,otis_inf,,,"(Disclaimer: I write ORMs for a living)<p>ORMs might issue lock hints but in general they simply start the transaction with the desired isolation level and let the RDBMS take care of the locking of affected rows/tables by statements executed.<p>Lock hints are sometimes used by naive ORMs who think you can implement optimistic concurrency using row locking. Their users will find out eventually that this whole row-locking doesn&#x27;t help anyone as it simply reverses the tables on &#x27;first write wins&#x27; vs. &#x27;last write wins&#x27;: there&#x27;s still someone who loses, so the locking doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of no-one losing their changes while it does give slower performance (and on SQL Server even the risk of deadlocks).<p>What developers often overlook is that there are two types of transactions: business transactions and DB transactions. A business transaction can span multiple DB transactions and a DB transaction can span multiple SQL statements. They&#x27;re not the same, seeing a business transaction as equal to a DB transaction makes things get messed up and often gives food to the need of explicit lock hints for some queries to e.g. get the false sense of being able to implement optimistic concurrency. If you consider a business transaction, locking doesn&#x27;t make any sense: it can take some time to complete it, so you have to deal with the side effects of stale data: it immediately becomes apparent that e.g. optimistic concurrency has no place here, one needs other ways to avoid people overwriting work of each other.<p>TFA re-orders statements to get the desired locks in place, and it IS possible to do so, e.g. some ORMs offer when to start a transaction or implement Unit of works which allow you to specify which batches to execute first (e.g. first deletes, then inserts). However the developer using the ORM isn&#x27;t working at that abstraction level, as the ORM offers an abstraction level above all that; so re-ordering statements to get the desired read locks or avoid dirty reads within a transaction is abusing knowledge of how the abstraction offered by the ORM internally works. IMHO one shouldn&#x27;t do that: the code utilizing the ORM is db agnostic: expecting certain DB behavior in DB agnostic code is going to give unpleasant side effects when the DB agnostic code will be used to e.g. utilize another RDBMS instead of the current one.",1442591779
10239924,comment,10238387,10239636,0,0,logicallee,,,"Thanks for the reply! Thanks for sharing your work with us as well.  It&#x27;s impressive.<p>It&#x27;s not disappointing, it&#x27;s quite a feat.  I suppose I would say that what I was trying to say is that &quot;parsing&quot;, while impressive, is not a large part of &quot;understanding&quot; in my opinion.  To use an analogy: almost by definition, compilers parse languages like C++ much better than humans do (basically perfectly, unless there&#x27;s literally a bug in the compiler or it doesn&#x27;t follow the standard due to some error).<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean they <i>understand</i> the programs (at all.) A compiler has no idea on an algorithmic level what a program might be doing (and if you remove comments, maybe a person won&#x27;t understand it either, if they&#x27;re not familiar with the algorithm.)<p>So my basic objection is that you&#x27;re really calling this reading comprehension, but I don&#x27;t think anything is actually being &quot;understood&quot;; just parsed.  A better title would be as I suggested: simple AI correctly answers reading comprehension questions.<p>The reason that I object to &quot;comprehension&quot; is that these days there really are a few &quot;deep learning&quot; systems, that can possibly synthesize information.  (I don&#x27;t know that much about them.)  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to elevate semantic parsing to the level of comprehension.<p>However the comment by tariqali34 makes a good point, that perhaps this is a criticism of reading comprehension tests.  I know in multiple-choice tests from standardized exams, I&#x27;ve been able to correctly answer reading comprehension questions about texts that I didn&#x27;t even read (by finding just the sentence that talks about it), or in other cases, texts that were too technical and that I didn&#x27;t understand.<p>I would say that I would be able to answer a question about some biomedical excerpt that I can&#x27;t understand a word of, I just can&#x27;t make heads or tails of it, let&#x27;s say:<p><i>In order to study the physiological roles of AGC kinases, a commonly used approach has been to over-express the active forms in cells. However, due to the overlapping substrate specificities of many AGC kinases, it is likely that the over-expression of one member of this kinase subfamily will result in the phosphorylation of substrates that are normally phosphorylated by another AGC kinase. Another strategy has been to over-express catalytically inactive ‘dominant negative’ mutants of AGC kinases in cells. However, such mutants are likely to interact with and inhibit the upstream protein kinase(s) that they are is activated by, and thus prevent the ‘upstream’ kinase(s) from phosphorylation of other cellular substrates. For example, a dominant negative RSK may interact with ERK1/ERK2 preventing the activation of MSK isoforms and hence the phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein) [9]. Furthermore, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, over-expression of catalytically inactive Rck2p, a kinase that binds to and is activated by the Hog1P MAPK, sequestered the substrate-docking site of the Hog1P kinase, thereby preventing Hog1P from interacting with other substrates. Thus catalytically inactive Rck2P is acting as a dominant negative mutant of Hog1P and not Rck2P.</i><p>I couldn&#x27;t answer a REAL reading-comprehension test about this:  I just have no idea what it&#x27;s REALLY talking about, I don&#x27;t actually understand it.  (Obviously on a syntactic level, it&#x27;s not hard to parse.)  I don&#x27;t know what over-expression is, I don&#x27;t know what a kinase is, I don&#x27;t know what phosphorylation is.  I don&#x27;t understand the text.  But if the questions are simple, perhaps I could answer some reading comprehension questions about this by parroting back quotations from it.  Syntactically, there&#x27;s nothing difficult here.  I just don&#x27;t understand it.<p>So I think it&#x27;s unfair to call sentence parsing real reading comprehension, even if sometimes reading comprehension tests fail to differentiate between the two.  You can parse sentences perfectly while understanding nothing.  For example, I could answer the question &quot;what is wrong with studying the physiological role of AGC kinases by overexpressing the active forms in cells?&quot; which the first sentence refers to.  I can just quote the second sentence &quot;Due to the overlapping substrate specificities of many AGC kinases, it is likely that the over-expression of one member of this kinase subfamily will result in the phosphorylation of substrates that are normally phosphorylated by another AGC kinase&quot;.  I don&#x27;t understand, but I think I correctly parroted.<p>So there are real issues in determining comprehension.  The higher the level of the question that is asked, the harder it is to answer without actually understanding the text.<p>I did find your work very interesting, thank you.",1442591770

They cannot, however, prove that taking SSRIs actually causes an increase in violent crime among young people because the analytical approach used does not fully account for time-varying risk factors such as symptom severity or alcohol misuse that might affect an individual’s risk of committing a violent crime (residual confounding). In addition, some people who committed a violent crime might have subsequently taken SSRIs to cope with the anxiety and stress of arrest (reverse causation). The lack of a significant association between SSRIs and violent crime among most people taking SSRIs is reassuring; the association between violent crimes and SSRIs among individuals younger than 25 years is worrying. However, this finding needs confirming in studies with other designs undertaken in other settings. If confirmed, warnings about the increased risk of violent behavior among young people when being treated with SSRIs might be needed. But, note the researchers, it might be inappropriate to restrict the use of SSRIs in this age group because increases in adverse outcomes associated with poorly treated depression, such as suicide, might outweigh the public health benefit accruing from decreases in violence.",1442590957

Sure, administering these drugs will make some patients report fewer negative symptoms-- typically the worst hit patients are helped the most, so it&#x27;s definitely worth employing clinically despite the hangups. Effectiveness on target isn&#x27;t a reason to stop asking critical questions and finding better alternatives. We know very well that long term use of antidepressants or other psychiatric medications has permanent consequences on brain structure and plasticity. There&#x27;s always long term sexual dysfunction as well, sometimes permanently.

Some places it is mandatory and others unheard of. For example not using it will negatively impact close rates in India but using it in the U.S. will negatively impact close rates.<p>With 3D Secure each issuing bank was responsible for how they implemented the process and it varies widely in both ease of use and security between issuing banks. Some banks may use simple passwords that can be fished while others may use one time pins sent by SMS to your mobile.<p>When a merchant uses 3D Secure fraud liability shifts to the issuing bank and the merchant gets a discount on the interchange.  This is also true when the bank hasn&#x27;t implemented 3D Secure or has done so poorly.  Because of this when 3D Secure was launched some banks put out systems that were non-functional simply to avoid the liability shift (i.e. it would prompt for a password but there was no functionality to create one).  Issuing banks have gotten their act together in the last decade but it&#x27;s still uneven.<p>Even when a merchant implement 3D Secure the merchant still needs to manage fraud levels to card association rules even though the merchant does not have liability for the fraud.  This is the &quot;we have to assume the risk but we don&#x27;t have to do business with you clause.&quot;  Individual issuing banks may chose to decline all of a merchants transactions if loss rates are unacceptable and the merchant may still lose their merchant account if overall loss rates are too high.  However because the charge back shifts to the banks the merchant may not even know which transactions are fraudulent.<p>Recently rules have been changed so that banks aren&#x27;t required to prompt for authentication in all cases. This is called risk-based-3D secure. So even if Candy Japan had implemented it he still may have seen the attack because the banks may not prompt for that low of an amount. He wouldn&#x27;t be out the money but still may be in trouble with the association if he didn&#x27;t do something to stop the attack.<p>When looking at automation there are two fundamental risk that any solution needs to address.

In this area machine learning algorithms are well understood and there are a few companies on the market that will rent merchants a model such as Sift Science or MaxMind.<p>The second one is anomaly detection and in the industry this is know as velocity control.  The problem is similar to detecting a hacker once they have penetrated the network, detecting a bio-terror attack based on hospitalization data or detecting insiders who have flipped.  These types of things have generated a lot of military interest and a lot of DARPA funding but little of it has made it into the commercial market due to the high rate of false positives.<p>Card testing is one example of a &#x27;high velocity&#x27; attack and are usually the work of professionals.  High velocity fraud has been more common with digital goods but more recently we&#x27;ve seen more high velocity attacks where an attacker will upload a merchants products on a site like Amazon or eBay.  When the attacker gets a sales they will use stolen credit cards to get the trageted merchant to fulfill the order.  Since these are professionals they generally will have tested the merchants fraud systems to understand what is considered low risk by the merchants fraud models and unless the merchant has some monitoring losses can be very high by the time the charge backs start coming in.<p>Currently there is no automated, fool-proof method for managing these high velocity attacks that I&#x27;m aware of.  Merchants initially started putting limits around the number of times that a single card could be used and the attackers responded with SQL injection attacks to get card in mass.  Merchants responded with limits on email addresses or other data points and the attackers responded by mass registering emails on free email providers and registering their own domains.  Merchants responded with limits on IP addresses and used of geo-ip location services and attackers responded with open proxies and VPNs.  Merchants responded with limits on orders from co-location facilities and VPN providers and attackers responded by compromising end-user machines en-masse.  Merchants responded with proxy detection and device fingerprinting and attackers responded with using RDP to end-user machines to launch attacks.  And it continues.",1442590743

While some foreign currency transactions fall under the regime of capital gains, a transaction resulting in the gain/loss of less than $200 are specifically excluded from capital gains [1].<p>Note that this relates specifically to changes in value of the US currency in relation to the commodity or foreign currency.  In this sense there is a difference between a sports car and a cup of coffee encoded in law.  If the euro you bought for $1 is suddenly worth $1.02, and you buy a 1 euro coffee, you&#x27;ll only realize $0.02 in gains, and not hit the $200 threshold.  If you buy a 100,000 euro sports car, you will realize a $2000 gain, and have to report that on your taxes.<p>Since bitcoin is a commodity, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the value moves 2 cents or 2 dollars or 2 million dollars, all gains are capital gains.<p>So if you buy a coffee with euros you specifically don&#x27;t need to report that, but with bitcoin you do.  Whether the IRS is going to notice that you don&#x27;t record every single capital gain arising from a bitcoin transaction is another question, but there is a major difference between foreign currencies and bitcoin as far as the IRS goes.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.maximadvisors.com/2013/12/us-taxation-of-foreign-currency-gains-or-losses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maximadvisors.com/2013/12/us-taxation-of-foreign-...</a>",1442590713

However, in this example, my program will fail to answer because my program does not augment any additional information but it can be extended to.<p>This can be implemented in our program by created a new property for each object called &quot;location&quot;. If a verb is location based, we can set the location of the object based on what the verb describes.

10239709,comment,10238112,10238112,0,0,throwaway98031,,,"This is an egregious violation on many levels. It highlights a massive gap in the clinical trials process (companies can stop trials without reporting negative results) that really should be addressed. I think everyone (outside of drug companies) can agree on that much.<p>I would like to say a few words on SSRIs (the class of drugs that Paxil is in) and their risks in general, because articles like these tend to cultivate strongly negative feelings toward SSRIs due to the deplorable drug company actions mentioned in this article. I don&#x27;t blame people for mistrusting the drug companies after reading something like this. I also feel that SSRIs are prescribed too quickly and with too little extra guidance from doctors, although that trend is changing a bit as doctors become more educated.<p>But my biggest concern is that we&#x27;re starting to see many people with severe depression who refuse to take SSRIs because they don&#x27;t trust the drug companies and they&#x27;ve come to believe that their severe depression is still better than the side effects or risks of an SSRI, which couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth.<p>The bottom line is that SSRIs, while far from perfect, are still one of the most effective first-line treatments for severe depression that we have, and they do it with a side effect profile that is head-and-shoulders above previous generation anti-depressants.<p>Perhaps the biggest problem with SSRI treatment is the delayed onset of action. Unlike short-term rewarding drugs such as stimulants or opioids that may boost one&#x27;s mood in the short term but quickly develop tolerance, SSRIs work through long-term adaptive changes. These changes are numerous, from increased BDNF and hippocampal growth to HPA axis normalization and restoration of brain connectivity back to a state that more closely matches that of non-depressed patients. However, the problem is that all of this happens as downstream effects of an alteration in how serotonin moves through the brain, which is very disruptive in the short-term while the brain adapts to the changes.<p>SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which means that it inhibits the ability of serotonin-releasing neurons to take serotonin back up from the synapse after they release it. This doesn&#x27;t &quot;raise serotonin levels&quot; as many describe it (unfortunately perhaps due to some awful SSRI marketing in the 90s and 00s) but rather alters the dynamics of how serotonin-based circuits operate. Serotonin will now spend more time in the synaptic cleft, activating post-synatpic serotonin receptors and synaptic transmission becomes a bit more smoothed out as the transmission takes longer to terminate via MAO deactivation of the serotonin or via uptake from the ~20% of uninhibited serotonin transporters.<p>Over time (4-8 weeks on average) the post-synaptic receptors adjust to the &quot;new normal&quot; levels of serotonin that they see in the synaptic space. This adjustment might even be key to some of the therapeutic effects of SSRIs, as some serotonin circuits may be too active in depressed or anxious patients, but the chronic SSRI administration quiets those receptors down, somewhat counter-intuitively. The big problem here is that until those receptors compensate, the patient may actually feel <i>worse</i> in the short-term. (Note that some patients actually feel substantially <i>better</i> during this phase, so please don&#x27;t take this as a given). In the worst-case, depression or anxiety are actually worsened temporarily, combined with an increased energy due to the SSRI&#x27;s activating effects. At the extreme worst-case scenario, this can lead to suicidal ideation, and for whatever reason this is more common in teenagers.<p>I wrote all of this out because the HN crowd tends to want to know how things work behind the scenes or under the hood when making decisions for themselves. My goal is not to suggest that everyone who experiences depression should be on SSRIs, because I actually feel that medication is probably best reserved as a first-line treatment for moderate to severe depression. Instead, my goal is to keep everyone informed such that they can work with their doctor to find the best treatment for themselves without unnecessarily fearing SSRIs due to these deplorable actions of drug companies a few years ago.<p>If you&#x27;re feeling depressed, work with your doctor to find a solution. If you question your doctor&#x27;s decision, see someone else. But it&#x27;s important to explore all options if depression is taking a toll on your life, and if you choose to go the SSRI route then be aware that therapeutic effects are 4-8 weeks out, at least, and talk to your doctor right away if you&#x27;re concerned.",1442589917

Some members of that team wrote code for that team&#x27;s goals, not on their own in private hours for their own goals. Therefore the code is owned by the team which Billy is a part of.<p>That also means that all the sales contracts Billy landed or they pitch they did, is also owned by the devs.<p>That would indeed suggest however that Billy going off on his own creating a 50/50 with someone else, using the team&#x27;s work, is like Eric Schmidt (supposing hypothetically for a moment he was a business-oriented member of the pre-Google team on day 1) taking page rank and starting a new company, i.e. total bs that wouldn&#x27;t hold up in court.<p>The whole 0.4% thing muddies the waters. It may be interpreted to say that whoever uses the produce of the team&#x27;s weekend work, must give 0.4% of their venture to the rest as a reward, and having given that reward, no other remuneration is necessary to use whatever the team came up with that weekend. That makes sense in the context of a single startup arising out of this deal, or even competing ventures who both use the software and each award each member 0.4% in their respective ventures, it starts to fall apart when you look at the non-software stuff, i.e. who can appropriate the sales contracts, the logo etc which can&#x27;t simply be used by two companies. It&#x27;s a muddy deal that could probably go either way in the courts, which is why Billy&#x27;s move is so asshole-y and why Bobby probably wanted to wipe his hands of it right away, forfeiting a 0.4% for real other reason other than wanting to disassociate and taking his $200 in the prize share he has a right to regardless.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not a lawyer so what makes legal sense to me is pretty meaningless :)",1442589648

Average humans are generally becoming more computer literate (or fluent in UI, to keep my analogy straight). UIs are getting more intuitive, which basically means closer to human language. The common ground is expanding from just common ground and a wider language is being developed that accommodates us both better.<p>The question to answer is what part of that common ground is voice is open, I guess.

For the question &quot;Why did Mary cheer?&quot; the screenshot showed that the simple AI literally answered &quot;because IT be HER FIRST TIME WINNING&quot;. This is correct, but the author edited it into a correct sentence for us.<p>For some reason, the library I used to get the present tense of &quot;was&quot; is &quot;be&quot;. I had a manually fix for this but accidentally removed it when I was cleaning up the code. Sorry if I disappointed you<p>> I think it is too much to call this &quot;capable of basic reading comprehension&quot;. Surely, &quot;simple sentence parser can answer reading comprehension questions&quot; would be more correct?<p>I would say it is capable of basic reading comprehension because it is attempts to build relationships between different objects although the relationships are weak. When humans do reading comprehension, we do what my program does which is try to parse the sentence and understand the relationships. But brains are also able to augment a lot more information and thus be more flexible with understanding.<p>> Would you say that 14-line Perl program is capable of basic reading comprehension? I wouldn&#x27;t!<p>I would say it is not because it does not understanding the relation between objects; it only understands that sentences starting with &quot;why&quot; should be answered with everything after the string &quot;because&quot;. Also, in your program, if there are two instances of &quot;because&quot; in the source, your program will only choose the first one.",1442589200
10239635,comment,10238112,10238112,0,0,mzs,,,"Depression runs in my family. Please be considerate in your replies here to me.<p>I think in US every available antidepressant has that &#x27;suicidal thoughts&#x27; warning right at the top of the list yet antidepressants have been a very valuable tool for our family for young and old alike.<p>I do not believe that any causation has been determined for currently commonly prescribed medications. This is Reuters article reprinted at sciam does not show that at least. What GSK did hiding studies is reprehensible of course. Vulnerable families were hurt. The positive is the increased scrutiny now thanks to that.<p>My beliefs on the matter: Antidepressants are one tool, about 20% of dealing with the level of depression in my family. Sometimes the chemicals in our brains are just so out of whack no amount of therapy gets to us.<p>For an adult like me, I have had enough experiences (bad relationships, financial strain, health issues, legal problems, work stress, and so on) in my life to more easily put them in healthy context to what happens three years out say. I also remember how when I was younger that was impossible cause I lacked that experience. This is reflected by the rest of my family.<p>What I believe happens is the following: People with depression are already more likely to have thoughts of hurting themselves. There are some young people that will use manipulation to get what they want that also suffer from depression. &#x27;You take away the only thing I like and I will hurt myself,&#x27; where that thing is not a healthy coping mechanism. So that thing gets taken away and the kid gets a psych-eval. The social worker evaluating everything decides this is a case of manipulation and the child is at an appropriate level of care. The problem is that some children have used manipulation but really do end-up hurting themselves after this since the other coping mechanisms they have in place at the time either get ignored or are insufficient.<p>Now my ire does not rest solely with GSK here. When I said the licensed state social worker evaluates everything, aspects come into that which should not for medical reasons but do for societal ones. One of those things have been what other options are available. People have been denied needed care based on there not being room in the programs (because of underfunding essentially), there not even being the appropriate program (for example intensive outpatient again often because of underfunding), or what insurance will pay. Thankfully that has not effected my nuclear family too much, but has affected others in my wider family that are unfortunate to live in other places or have worse insurance. That said, even to this day there are limits to mental health in my insurance program. Thankfully they are not not as onerous as they were in the past, but it does cause us stress to navigate it and not go over what is permitted.<p>The other thing is that simply you need a good team to work with you, a doctor and a therapist. There are those with mental health illnesses that are unlucky to not have good choices there. There are too many practitioners that are simply overworked and can&#x27;t really offer the attention that is needed for proper care. They have known about this &#x27;suicidal thoughts&#x27; danger, but they also see the benefits which nothing else offers. So they get into a routine of using one system for everyone as much as possible. But then because of time and insurance reasons there is not enough attention to tune it then as time goes on together with therapy. For example our insurance will only pay for a parent to consult with a therapist once a week for a child even in intensive outpatient care. So you have to find one willing to do that over the phone more often and not get paid for it essentially.<p>Well that was rambling, sorry, but somewhat therapeutic for me currently, thank you.",1442589186

Or, conversely, you could switch out, add to, or remove some of your applications (say, switch from Tableau to Pentaho) without having to touch your data sources.\n<a href=""http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/v8.0/pro/online/en-us/extracting_TDE_API.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/v8.0/pro/online/en-us/extracti...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.tableau.com/new-features/data-engine-api-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tableau.com/new-features/data-engine-api-0</a>\n<a href=""http://open-source.socrata.com/architecture/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://open-source.socrata.com/architecture/</a><p>So really Socrata is a super user friendly API solution, which your school can use completely privately and securely in-house, in conjunction with your data sources and applications. The CEO of Socrata actually speaks directly to this use-case here: <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-products-like-Socrata-but-for-private-data-sets"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-products-like-Socrata-bu...</a><p>One scenario would be using PostgreSQL (to store your data) + Socrata (API layer) + Pentaho (analytics, visuals, and reporting). Then, if you don&#x27;t like Pentaho, you can switch it out for Tableau without having to touch PostgreSQL. Or, if you decide you don&#x27;t enjoy managing your PostgreSQL instance, you can switch to Google Cloud SQL (<a href=""https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/introduction</a>).<p>Just want to say that I have zero affiliation with any of these companies, and that I&#x27;m sure there are other products out there that would accomplish the same solution, architecture wise.<p>Another link that may help decide if this solution might be worth looking into more:\n<a href=""http://customer-summit.socrata.com/sessions/added-value-open-datas-internal-use-case/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://customer-summit.socrata.com/sessions/added-value-open...</a><p>And, since I mentioned it above, you might want to look at <a href=""http://www.pentaho.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pentaho.com/</a>.<p>Regardless, I&#x27;d spend some time on this site before making any decisions.<a href=""http://apievangelist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apievangelist.com/</a>.\nAnd glance through this book: <a href=""http://htchttp.s3.amazonaws.com/books/apis_a_strategy_guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://htchttp.s3.amazonaws.com/books/apis_a_strategy_guide....</a>",1442588754

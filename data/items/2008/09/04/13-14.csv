Animorphic Smalltalk was a Smalltalk system built around the mid-90s as part of a startup that was informally known as Animorphic Systems. In early 1997, Animorphic was acquired by Sun, and much of the underlying VM technology was put to real use in the Java Hotspot VM.""",1220536397

You're absolutely right about the big risk, but sometimes the reward is <i>worth</i> the risk. Selling Photoshop plugins means being dependent on Adobe's decisions, but that doesn't mean you should go into business selling Gimp plugins instead.<p>What you have to do is keep the risk firmly in mind, and hedge it.

294770,comment,294631,294631,0,0,duh77,,,"If you extrapolate from David S. Rose's numbers Angelsoft pulls in something like ten to thirty thousand dollars per day. Amazingly, the fee you pay won't guarantee a meeting with anybody.<p>No one who has the clout to get a deal out of this system needs to use it in the first place. If your company is good enough to get a deal under these conditions you could cold call just about any investor and receive funding. Angelsoft makes all of its money off entrepreneurs who they know have no chance of getting funding. What David S. Rose does should be illegal.<p>Here's how it works: 100 people walk in the door with $150, thinking they're going to get money for their business. David takes the $150 from 88 of them and immediately ushers them to the exit. The remaining 12 are invited to present in front of someone. But oh, their businesses just aren't right. So 11 more people fork over their $150 and leave. The remaining person (still forking over his $150), then forks over a substantial piece of his company at a low valuation. The only reason this ridiculous scheme works is because people believe they are going to get something back. They aren't. This is known as a ""confidence scam.""",1220535829
294769,comment,294669,294693,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Scribd... [is] not affected by this news.</i><p>If this is so, then Scribd's PR person really needs to write TechCrunch every fifteen minutes until the site puts up a bigger correction.  Just marking up the word ""Scribd"" in the story with a strikethru is nowhere near enough. A lot of readers might miss that detail. Others, like me, will see it but have no idea why it's there. And even if you recognize that they've been crossed out, just mentioning Scribd in this context is to associate them with something bad. As it stands, the article is the textual equivalent of a politician saying ""Many public figures have fatal illnesses, but I would never accuse my opponent of having Lou Gehrig's Disease.""<p>The fact that the word ""Scribd"" even appeared in that story calls for the removal of their name from the main story and the addition of a full blown, fall-on-our-sword, ""We screwed up and didn't check our facts; Scribd has nothing to do with this story; we regret the error"" apology at the end. This is nothing to be sly about.",1220535743

That's the difference between Rails and Django - if it were Rails reaching 1.0, there would be a huge party and screencasts everywhere and a demo showing how to write windows 95 in 10 minutes.<p>Django just released and that's all.<p>On the one hand I'm happy because over hyped products tend to be constantly flooded by new users. On the other hand, if a project is too quiet, it tends to lose users to more sexy technologies, and sooner or later, nobody is using it.<p>I don't want it to turn out that I put my bets on the betamax of the the frameworks.",1220535519

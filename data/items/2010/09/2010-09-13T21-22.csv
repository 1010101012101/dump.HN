The weird part is that if you explicitly assign null to an element of the list, it deletes the element.  That's particularly weird because the list has knows all the elements in it, so it's not like it can't tell the difference between a value that has been set to NULL and a value that has never been set.

Oh, better: the lack of a minimize!<p>Really, that's easy: Apple Platinum (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appearance_Manager"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appearance_Manager</a>).  I know, it's heresy!  Still, I like the elegant simplicity of Apple Platinum.  The color is brighter than the Windows grey; I like the horizontal pin-striping in the title bar; I like the purple accents which give it a soft, classy feel (rather than a more contrast-y feel) and it feels easier on my eyes than, say, Windows; I like the simplicity of the controls (such as the simple two black horizontal lines for the ""shade-up"" function) combined with the soft gradient of the square control.  I think it made great use of space as well.  The title bar wasn't big as is the current trend (damn kids wasting my pixels).<p>I'm also just not the biggest fan of the transparent movement.  I don't find that it increases my usability, but rather detracts from it by making things fuzzy.  For example, the OS X menu (today) is mostly opaque - you can't read anything behind it.  However, the little transparency makes it harder to read as there's fuzzy changes behind where you're trying to read.  Windows Aero is the worst.  Those transparent windows with the changing fuzzyness depending on how you move them - yikes!  I also don't like that the menu is white.  Contrast is good, but I prefer black on platinum to black on white for my eyes.<p>There's even a little part of me that misses pixel-based icons.  Having a set canvas to work with meant that authors tried to pack good meaning into small space.  Now, you're expected to waste lots of pixels.  Yeah, I like my screen real-estate.<p>Now, nothing I've said is objective at all.  It's just my aesthetic.  OS X, as time has gone on, has gotten closer to my aesthetic.  Some of the more garish things have left, but the horizontal pin-stripes have also left.  I don't want to make this sound like I don't think OS X is nice to look at - it is.  But there's a part of me that misses the simple look of OS 9 and BeOS (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BeOS_Desktop.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BeOS_Desktop.png</a>) which had an elegance about them.

Then iterate over the following points seeking traction and revenue.</i>""<p>No, he doesn't. He really <i>really</i> doesn't. In fact, that's the <i>exact opposite</i> of what he advocates and what his customer development methodology attacks - the old school product development approach of building the product first and then collecting feedback to refine it, figuring out how to market it, finding out who the target customer is, etc.<p>Developing your customer base (rather than developing your product) means that you talk to customers and learn their existing pain points <i>before</i> you design or build a single thing. His Four Steps To The Epiphany MBA textbook calls it Customer Discovery, or step one. Everything in the #1-4 loop you described is step two - Customer Validation - where you then try to validate your hypothesis about the customer pain points with your product ideas and/or prototypes.<p>I'm ripping off this giant rant because for some reason, I see this on HN a lot. <i>A lot</i>. It's really common for people to conflate MVP with customer development and to also reverse the order that you do it. I think you see this on HN in particular because it's filled with coders that prototype in code the way designers prototype on paper, so they think ""hmm, how hard could it be for me to throw something together in a week or two and see if anyone will buy it?"" instead of ""how hard could it be for me to go talk to people and see if there's a potential customer base for this idea I have?"" It's not just that the second path is easier, it means that the product you build afterwards is <i>way</i> better informed. On the other hand, MVP seems to appeal to HNers because it's like the Nike message of startups - Just Do It. Just go ahead and build something already because all you need to do afterwards is refinement. A little bit of a/b testing magic on landing pages here, a bit of keyword research on Adwords there and then bam, your app is paying the rent while you drink margaritas on the beach.<p>Off the top of my head, one of the more recent examples I can think of was just this last month when Zach Burt (zackattack) unveiled Awesomeness Reminders and someone asked him about all the stuff he's built this year, so he wrote about his personal process for throwing tons of little MVP apps against the wall and then why he'd ditch each one before moving on to the next:<p><a href=""http://www.zacharyburt.com/2010/08/an-open-discussion-of-my-personal-business-strategy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zacharyburt.com/2010/08/an-open-discussion-of-my-...</a><p>Not to pick on the guy, but this was a particularly egregious example. Explaining why he abandoned one of his apps (CustomerFind), he wrote:<p>""<i>I did do some Customer Development meetings related to CustomerFind, and pivots suggested room for a potential enterprise-y Social Media dashboard product.</i>""<p>No, you didn't! You didn't do Customer Development - you did Customer Validation, where you did a little bit of research <i>after you built the product</i> to see if the product you <i>already built</i> solved the problems <i>that you just plain guessed</i> your customers had. In other words, you tried to skip a step and validate your product against customer base that you didn't create in advance and then surprise! There wasn't a fit and the app wasn't monetizable. An interest list based on email signups is not the same as purchase orders. Rinse and repeat for 4 or 5 apps and there went his 2010 so far.<p>So when do you do MVP and when do you do Customer Development?<p>Easy - it depends on whether you're building something where you're also the target audience, scratching your own itch, eating your own dogfood, Tim O'Reilly's ""fishing with strawberries"", etc, or if you're building something for other people.<p>Both approaches are still just different versions of PG's ""make stuff people want"" but you need some kind of internal compass to guide the way. If you know the phone in your pocket sucks and you can build a better experience, then Apple can go make something that's clearly better without having to do a lot of market research. So they do. And if you think you'd like to get a call every once in a while and hear a real human being tell you that you're awesome, then there you go. But if you're building something for other people to use that have problems that you don't experience on a daily basis, like say, an app for bloggers that get a good amount of traffic and are looking to get into direct sales rather than relying solely on Adsense's anemic payouts, then you better do your homework and get on the phone.",1284413688

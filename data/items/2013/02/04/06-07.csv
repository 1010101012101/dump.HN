5162876,comment,5161811,5162712,9,0,daeken,,,"Generally speaking, vulnerability discovery is fairly straightforward, just requires tenacity and a knack for knowing where to look/fuzz.  Exploitation on this level requires a huge amount of creativity, to know how to fit the building blocks together into a functioning exploit.  Regardless, I'd put them on about the same level of difficulty, having done both (though I've done far, far more discovery than exploitation).<p>> the other impressive thing is the lack of generic fixes even thus we know how to make them happen (which involve using pretty much using a ""written-from-the-ground-up"" OS), apparently, security is fairly low on the ""it makes us lose money, let's fix it all properly"" scale ;-)<p>This is the real meat of this comment, though, and it's what I really want to respond to.  We <i>don't</i> have generic fixes that actually meet our requirements in terms of performance and developer time.  The real, fundamental problem is simple: memory corruption should not be <i>possible</i>; put another way, pointers considered harmful.  Possible solutions to this are the Singularity/RenrakuOS/SharpOS/MOSA approach, where you have a tiny, trusted compiler that takes on the security risk and generates native code, with the entire rest of the system running in safe, managed code.<p>I promoted this concept for a while -- RenrakuOS is mine -- but at the end of the day, the performance is just not there yet, and won't be for quite a while.  But even more than that, it doesn't solve any of the problems with logic-related vulnerabilities; these become more and more important as you eliminate the lower level bugs.",1359961110

There is no reason why students can't do interactive labs with help from teachers online.<p>So I think that in most cases, there really doesn't have to be any qualitative difference between online and in person learning.<p>But there are lots of advantages, starting with the increased ability for students to work at their own pace.  And for computer assisted learning, i.e. interactive learning activities on a computer, possibly graded automatically by a computer.  Also the ability to communicate online can be a big advantage over having to physically walk to an office hours or library.  And of course the obvious one is the ease of distributing electronic textbooks and other learning materials online.  Or for example delivering a live or recorded lecture online to an audience of 10,000 students from all over the world rather than to an audience of 100 students at some expensive university.<p>This is just one of many areas were social institutions are lagging far behind technological progress.

If the ""waitress"" did not POST the picture on the Internet then the pastor would have been left alone.

You never disrespect the customer by trying to insult them online.<p>On religion and her being a pastor (of a 15 member church).  Why should we expect rational, conscientious behavior from some random pastor?   The world is shocked that she didn't want to give a tip and then made a reference a God while doing so.  It is religion, I don't expect thought-out, kind behavior from religious people.  Why should we?

Her original accounting of the incident was completely fabricated because she didn't actually serve the table, though she represented herself as if she did.<p>For example, the customer's name, Alois, is a man's name, but the customer was actually a female with a male's first name. The waitress asserted that the customer was a man. When she later found out she was wrong she backpeddled and claimed she knew that but that she was protecting the customer's identity. However she publicly posted the customer's name and location, enabling people to track down the customer and begin threatening her.<p>Another detail she got wrong was claiming the customer left no tip. The customer left the tip as cash on the table, as most people in the US do, and something that most servers prefer, rather than pay it as part of the bill. The restaurant also though double charged the customer for the tip, meaning the customer ended up paying 36% rather than 18% on the bill as tip. Because the waitress had not served the table she assumed that the strike out of the tip line meant the customer left no tip at all.<p>In short, the waitress violated a customer's privacy, lied about the customer publicly defaming her, publicly ridiculed her religious beliefs, and instigated an internet mob riot against the customer which continues to this day in the form of threats and harassment and has caused the customer severe mental anguish. If I was an attorney in the area I would be preparing a large lawsuit against the restaurant at this time, and I would certainly prevail in court.<p>Her firing was completely justified and her complaining about being fired in the media and claiming herself as victim when she was the bully is absolutely outrageous.",1359959482

Not only is it a classic ""no true Scotsman"", it also neglects to note that increasingly all large courses at large state universities are adopting a model not unlike the MOOC model.  Lectures are increasingly posted online, and coursework is now almost always a blackboard quiz.  Projects are submitted online, no paper copies are ever even created.  Office hours are available, true, but often they are with a TA who is only slightly more than a glorified Tutor.  All of these are transparent time and money saving moves on the part of the departments and professors.<p>Students rarely object as online classes give them more flexibility to work (something rarely mentioned in these kind of articles).

If how well the treatment works and the nature of its side effects <i>aren't</i> known, then <i>no one</i> has the relevant knowledge to make an informed decision, and it still remains up to the <i>patient</i> to weigh the unquantifiable possibility of relief against the equally unquantifiable risk of a bad outcome.<p>There's simply no way around the fact that the question <i>always</i> boils down to a deeply personal value judgement that <i>no third party</i> has the right to usurp.<p>> Terminal ill people are often desperate and would try whatever is trendy<p>Right.

If, in some specific case in the future, patient and doctor agree that the ABMT procedure might be worth trying, no third party is going to actively overrule their judgment.

I.e., it protects the network and other clients from DoS.<p>Protecting TCP congestion control prevents a couple of attacks:\n* a selfish client may consume more than its fair share of the bandwidth\n* a malicious client may use the server to amplify a DoS attack. E.g., in the absence of replay protection, an attacker limited to only 1 Mb/s of bandwidth could cause the server to consume 10-20 Mb/s (other examples of amplification include smurf attacks; some TCP implementations from the 1990s could also be tricked). With replay protection, the attacker would actually have to have the full 10-20Mb/s of bandwidth to cause that level of damage.<p>Note that the HMAC protects against related attacks that are based on spoofing the client IP.<p>The amount of state stored at the server is proportional to the bandwidth. E.g., a server with a fatter pipe will need larger bloom filters to handle the higher packet rate. In Trickles, the amount of bandwidth-proportional state is mathematically clean to compute -- typical Bloom filter collision equations. By comparison, TCP will hold some fixed overhead per connection, consisting of TCB (TCP control block, for congestion control state) and socket/fd structs. Every TCP connection also buffers a variable amount of sent but unacknowledged data (proportional to window size).<p>The fixed per-connection overhead of TCP alone requires asymptotically more server-side state than Trickles. Since the size of TCP send buffers varies according to window size, which is determined by protocol dynamics, its tricky to construct a model of how much server state will be consumed by socket buffers. In our experiments, the socket buffers dominated server-side memory consumption.<p>- Alan Shieh",1359958410

(I am allowed to be embarrassed rather than just outraged since I work there.)<p>* Top middle text below the blue line should be removed.<p>* Some links on the left side lead to ugly, empty search result pages (archiving & discovery implementation, etc.). How about don't show the categories to users until you have something in them?<p>* ""0 review""? You were smart enough to specialize the ""1 review"" versus ""2+ review_s_"" case but couldn't work out that 0 is plural?<p>* There should be a two-line limit on the titles of apps shown in the right-side bar. And they should have icons. The number of reviews should be shown without ""reviews,"" and the stars and number should be a link to the actual reviews.<p>* When I have no search results, it pops up a result page that seems to assume that I have entered keywords. It says ""Your search - - did not return any listings."" Then it makes suggestions that I modify my keywords. This should obviously not be the cases since I did not use any keywords in the first place.<p>* The category titles on the left side should be reworked. The mapping follows:<p><pre><code>  On all, s/[Ii]mplementation//g\n          s/[Aa]plication//g\n  \n  Support and managed services is really two different\n  categories, they should be split and ""services"" \n  eliminated.\n  \n</code></pre>\nThe overall odor of management bs is all around this site too. I guess people who eat that are who they are trying to attract, but it doesn't make standing near the outhouse stink any less.<p>I don't understand how mistakes as basic as these could possibly be made. It's not like there's a complicated database or optimization problem behind this website. It probably won't even see one qps on a normal day.

That transportation is so expensive that in much of the US it's cheaper and more convenient to own a half ton piece of steel and burn 7300 gallons of petroleum products a year than to rely on something community-based (public transport, anyone?) - does that say something about us as a nation? That we have naturally (or, as some would point out, unnaturally) drifted towards the methods of least efficiency in our society, for transport at least?<p>What is the value in having a house? Is it the land? I suppose land is important. What happens when your land loses value drastically, though? Turn it into farmland? Process it for trace elements?<p>Is it the house? The way they're built these days, they won't last another twenty years.<p>Our lives are transient. Shouldn't our abodes and methods of transportation be more permanent, built to outlast us and benefit future generations?<p>True: success takes hard work, dedication, and more hard work. That people are worried, in a modern society, about obtaining access to the very things which are necessary to /do/ that hard work (a safe home; healthy food; transportation to loved ones and places of work; knowledge) makes me sad. Lack of motivation and general ennui among the populace \nis not the cause of problems, but a symptom of them.<p>One cause, as outlined (with poor examples, nonetheless) is bubble-wrapping everything for future generations.

1180421,comment,1180308,1180308,0,0,btilly,,,"In most cases I agree.  If you can't get a job with your primary language, you'll have a harder time getting one in a language you just learned.<p>But there are exceptions.  For instance if you don't have a programming background, learning the basics of something employable is a good idea.  Also some things do become obsolete.  For instance if your background is VB 5, you should update your skills to be more employable.  (Actually you should have done that a few years back...)<p>Another exception is when a particular area is hot.  If not many know a suddenly popular language or library, teaching yourself that tool can give you an edge on those jobs.  Of course most jobs are maintaining something that already exists, and so don't need to cool new stuff.  And more people try that strategy than there are jobs, so it may be a losing proposition to compete there.  But, for instance, a lot of people learned Java back in the mid-90s to jump on a bandwagon, and it worked out for many of them.<p>Also it is fine to learn something for the job prospects when you have an obvious hole in your resume.  For instance if you've been doing statistics professionally and you haven't learned R, you probably should.  If you're a Perl web programmer and haven't learned Catalyst, it is at least worth playing with for a couple of weekends.  A Java programmer is on solid ground in deciding to learn Spring better.<p>A special case of the obvious hole is when you need to learn something to get a certification.  The whole certification treadmill is something I hate.  But there is no question that it can help you, and acquiring relevant certifications is not a useless endeavor.<p>And a final exception is if there is a specific requirement for a job you want that you have a realistic shot at.  For example I learned three languages before my Google interview.  I knew that the interview would be in some combination of C++, Java and Python, and I knew none of them.  So I learned the basics of all three, and made my lack of experience clear in the interviews.  I was not hired for my knowledge of those languages.  But without putting out that effort I couldn't have passed the interview.  However this kind of situation is the rarest of them all.  (This has only happened to me once.)",1268207171

1180412,comment,1180308,1180308,0,0,patio11,,,"I think this is largely good advice.  You could expand it to thinks much more concrete than ""improve your job-getting skill"": make yourself a portfolio website if you don't already have one.  Make decisionmaker-specific pages on your portfolio website targeting the exact interests of the people who you want to hire you.<p>(Hypothetically assuming I wanted to apply to Google, Big Japanese Megacorp, and Cool Valley Startup, I'd be pitching myself in a very different way in the cover letters and resumes... why show them all the same portfolio?  I mean, theoretically I'm supposed to be pretty good at this whole ""Build a web page to sell stuff"" thing -- if I can't build a web page to sell <i>me</i>, why should they hire me?)<p>If you don't already have a blog and social proof of value which you can quote to people, start building them.  For example: you put a recommendation on your resume in the hope someone calls them, they agree to talk, and then they praise you, right?  That's an awful lot of opportunities for the recommendation to not pan out well.  Instead, when you ask for a recommendation, ask for a testimonial, too, which you will prominently quote in your Hire Me salesletter.  And write the testimonial for them.  ""Hey boss, can I quote you on '$NAME_HERE is one of the best developers I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  He has done things with $PROJECT that we never thought were possible.  I'd hire him in a second.'?""  (This presumes you have, actually, made a good impression on your boss.  If not, then just write down their phone number and pray that no one calls it, because that is apparently what everyone else does.)<p>Networking is, obviously, another opportunity for improvement.  Rather than spending time waiting for someone to call you back, it is (well past) time to start reacquainting yourself with friends and business associates (and mentioning, hey, you're on the market now) and making new friends/business associates.",1268206560

Most sensible people understand that ""Meetings are toxic"" doesn't mean ""Never ever communicate"" or anything silly - if anything, I'd say don't tone it down. People who like 37S like it because you turn the volume up and say it like it is and are not afraid of being casually outrageous at times. So please don't go excessively mainstream-friendly! Cheers and thanks for all the good work and free value you guys have distributed into the world, I'll be picking up a copy of Rework once I thin my reading list out a little.",1268204796

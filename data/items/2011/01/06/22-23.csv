If a woman thinks of the best sex she’s had in her life, she’s often thinking of this kind of sex, and while it may be the best sex in her life, it’s not the sex she wants to have throughout her life or more accurately, it’s not the sex she’d have with the man with whom she’d like to spend her life.""<p>So debasing sex is great so long as it's not with someone you care about?

When the high priest of capitalism himself is declaring the growth in economic inequality a national crisis, something has gone very, very wrong.""<p>The above paragraph suggests that the author is aware of Ayn Rand and disagrees with both her (who was not libertarian) and the libertarians.  Then the author goes on to imply that the free market is responsible for the rising income inequality and to put all the rich under the same common denominator, with no regard for the source of their wealth (note how many names are cited and the widely varying reputations of the businessmen in question).  Ayn Rand is very explicit on the distinction of gaining wealth through thoughtful and productive effort on the one hand and through special privileges on the other.  It is this observation that the author has ignored.<p>Second, the author concludes that ""the lesson of history is that, in the long run, super-elites have two ways to survive: by suppressing dissent or by sharing their wealth"", so they must choose one of these options.  This message ends an article that would constitute a weak response to Ayn Rand (if the article was meant to be one).  It sanctions a systems that says: the rich, no matter how they got to be rich in the first place, should either abuse the rest of the population, as they often did in feudal times, or will have to see their property seized by force, as it is done in socialist and communist countries.  Otherwise, they cannot survive.  Well, that's a very dangerous proposition for individual rights.",1294354562

2077624,comment,2076785,2077241,0,0,nkurz,,,"<i>claiming that online porn demonstrates how the male psyche is fueled by the need to hurt and humiliate women sexually</i><p>I don't see a contradiction, since I don't think she is making this claim.  This would be hard to determine by textual analysis, though, since I'm sure my own context for the article is just as subjective.  I'll write her and ask if she'd be willing to comment, but of course then we're into postmodernism, and the intent of the author being irrelevant to your interpretation.<p>In the meantime, I think that Vargas-Cooper is coming more from a 90's feminist-backlash position than the earlier 70's 'men are evil' view.  Or maybe it's slash-backlash: ""He answered, almost without thought, 'Because that’s the only thing that will make you uncomfortable.' This was, perhaps, the greatest moment of sexual honesty I’ve ever experienced—and without hesitation, I complied. This encounter proves an unpleasant fact that does not fit the feminist script on sexuality: pleasure and displeasure wrap around each other like two snakes.""<p>I think her point is that we need to acknowledge the forces that exist (including a desire to degrade) without giving up or pretending they don't exist.  But I don't think she feels that this is exclusive to males, nor that this is the primary fuel of the male psyche.  And I think her point is that two players are needed to maintain the illusions, and that not all illusions should be thrown out.  She didn't smack him across the face and pay for her own cab ride home, rather she took the honesty as a compliment and stayed.",1294353897

2077622,comment,2077521,2077521,0,0,mindcrime,,,"Honestly, it's hard to say.  I don't think I'm driven much by obvious and immediate peer influence, since I can't remember the last time I bought anything... mp3 player, car, clothes, etc. based on any influence from a close friend.  I have pretty specific tastes in each of those things, and I tend to buy what I want based on my own criteria.<p>Now how much my tastes - in general - where shaped by the influence of others in an indirect sense, is hard to say.  For example, the last portable music player I bought was chosen specifically because it was the biggest device the local Best Buy had in stock that supports Ogg Vorbis.  I favor patent unencumbered formats like Ogg, and am trying to get away from using mp3s in general.  So, how much did my friends, colleagues, etc. influence my stance as a free software, open standards, open source, etc. ideologue? I have no idea.<p>Same for my last car... I bought a Mazda RX-8 because I like fast, sporty little cars; not because any of my friends have RX-8's (ok, one friend has one, but I didn't know it when I bought mine.)  But who's to say why I like fast, black, sports cars?  I look at it more as a matter of accretion, over the course of decades, and the influence of many sources... not something I can pin on any specific (small) set of immediate influencers.<p>Clothes?  Hmmm.. I don't dress like anybody I know, since I like to wear waist-coats and cravats with jeans.  It's an eclectic taste I glommed together from bits & pieces of various influences.... being a Doctor Who fan, liking the Steampunk genre, Victorian era fiction, etc.<p>Now is any of that <i>purely</i> rational? Hell no.  There's definitely a peer influence, ""glommed together from bits over time"" aesthetic.  But there is (sometimes) a rational aspect mixed in.  Like choosing a certain music player because of it's format support and storage capacity, or choosing Mazda because they have a good quality reputation, etc.<p>I guess that was a lot of words to say ""I don't know,"" but that's kinda it.  It's hard to isolate the different factors that go into these decisions.",1294353871

Taking it too far leads to the exact same kind of backwards thinking where (taking race instead of gender) reading books is ""acting white"". If one group in society (men, whites, etc.) is dominant, and society continues to function, then obviously the dominant group is doing something right, and forcing or pressuring the oppressed group into doing something wrong. In the racial case, that ""something"" is education. Whites oppressed blacks; whites were educated while blacks weren't.

Saying these standards ""exist to reinforce male hegemony"" is an exaggeration, for the most part men aren't actively trying to oppress women, they're just not succeeding in achieving true equality. From a women's perspective, it's the same result, although sensationalizing doesn't really help their cause.<p>As a somewhat abstract example, when women are compared to men in the workplace, they're usually seen as cautious or passive. Now, this is true, that the average female is more cautious or passive <i>than the average male</i> (leaving aside nature vs nurture for a second). But that bolded part is critical--most people, when making the observation that women are more passive, don't realize that they're using a male standard as a basis for judgment.<p>It's important to note, that the differences attributed to women are not necessarily bad ones. One could just as easily say, men are rash and compulsive. And, this would also be true, in exactly the same fashion: the average male is rash and compulsive <i>compared to the average female</i>. But, because of historical male hegemony, the average male is taken as the ideal or the standard. Difference from this standard, even when neutral or situationally advantageous, tends to be perceived first as a deficiency.<p>Here's a slightly more concrete example, which I don't know if it's true but it could be: until recently, men drove cars and women were mostly passengers (this is still true in other countries). Cars were physically designed around the average male body. When women started driving, that meant that they were allowed in the driver's seats, but those seats were still designed for men. The pedal and mirror placements were sub-optimal for their generally smaller bodies. Even though women have achieved nominal equality in the area of driving, until car makers update their design constraints, women operate cars at a disadvantage because they must conform to a standard that was designed without them and that does not fit them. On the one hand it's unfortunate, but on the other hand it's inevitable, because it's not a good business decision to design a car for people who don't drive (until they do).",1294351987

Most usage of Twitter is browsing, while Quora users (at least the ones asking or researching questions) seem similar to searchers, so that portion of their traffic may be much more valuable, depending on how successful they are at monetizing it.<p>One problem with this theory is that some of Quora's traffic right now (don't know the proportion, but I'd assume it's high in terms of page views) is users answering questions or browsing updates from friends, who fit more into the browsers mold than searchers.

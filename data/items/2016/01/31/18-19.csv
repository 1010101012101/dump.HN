If everyone was getting basic income and we eliminated a bunch of entitlements such as disability and unemployment insurance, then there would be no need for those entire sections of the government payroll.<p>Of course in order to actually achieve any savings we would need to truly eliminate those other entitlements and fire all of the people that work in the departments that currently oversee them. That is the heavy lift politically.<p>The same is true for a lot of policies that make sense economically but may not survive contact with the political system. Major tax reform is another obvious example. Everyone knows we could have a variety of different tax systems that are economically better than the one we have today, but in order to get there we need to eliminate some tax carveouts that people love.<p>The pathway from today to the desired state can&#x27;t just be hand waved away.

Especially programmers. Here&#x27;s the differences I put in my original critique to Joanna about Qubes&#x27; design choices. The Xen project stemmed from the Nemesis OS:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_%28operating_system%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_%28operating_system%29</a><p>The architecture was designed for efficiency and management goals. The Xen project became a virtualization system that used a chunk of Linux in Dom0 for drivers, put guests in other VM&#x27;s, and had plumbing to let them work together. IPC & VM launching had horrid performance. Kernel was complex. A nice architecture for virtualization that did improve over time in many ways. Unfortunately, you have to trust significant components like Dom0 and Xen that weren&#x27;t designed for high-security. The complexity of Xen alone gave difficulty for the only team I know that tried to increase its assurance directly:<p><a href=""http://www-archive.xenproject.org/files/xensummitboston08/XenSummitSpring08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-archive.xenproject.org/files/xensummitboston08/Xe...</a><p>So, Qubes built on that foundation. That was my primary gripe with it as this probably wouldn&#x27;t reach either assurance or performance (esp IPC) of microkernels. Otherwise, they did add a lot of good usability features and isolated some pieces. That was good. The category I place it in is a cross between a MILS and CMW system whose attack surface is in the middle. To help you understand that, I&#x27;ll give an old paper on CMW&#x27;s that shows what they looked like and one describing MILS architecture (i.e. separation kernels).<p><a href=""http://web.ornl.gov/~jar/doecmw.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.ornl.gov/~jar/doecmw.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/workshops/RT_2004_Manual/00-T2_Beckwith_etal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/workshops/RT_2004_Manual/00...</a><p>Note: Argus PitBull is a commercial example of CMW still around. MILS was implemented by Green Hills, Lynx, & VxWorks by 2005-2006. All still around if you choose to Google them.<p>So, MILS desktops were built like the Orange Book systems to be certified at EAL6 or EAL7. That required a ridiculous amount of security activity. See pg 8 and 12-14 here...<p><a href=""http://lukemuehlhauser.com/wp-content/uploads/Karger-et-al-A-retrospective-on-the-VAX-VMM-security-kernel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lukemuehlhauser.com/wp-content/uploads/Karger-et-al-A...</a><p>...plus Section 6 and 7 on p 125 here...<p><a href=""http://aesec.com/eval/NCSC-FER-94-008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aesec.com/eval/NCSC-FER-94-008.pdf</a><p>...to see what kind of assurance went into security kernels from prior times. Went all out with MAC, integrity levels, segments, object-based protection, covert channel analysis, generation on-site, config management. Lots of stuff to counter all threats, including malicious insiders. Current certs require even more on assurance side although HW-assists can be weaker. That&#x27;s why only a handful make the cut & usually cost $$$. ;) Hope you see why my baseline was MILS-style separation kernels rather than Xen or whatever. So, what is similar in OSS world?<p>Nizza Architecture (2004 onward)\n<a href=""https://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/papers_ps/nizza.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/papers_ps/nizza.pdf</a><p>Perseus Architecture\n<a href=""http://www.perseus-os.org/content/pages/Hypervisor.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perseus-os.org/content/pages/Hypervisor.htm</a><p>Note: Closer to Xen models but with Nizza- or MILS-style design attributes. This was implemented as Turaya Security Kernel & Turaya Desktop. It <i>may</i> be used in Sirrix TrustedDesktop but not sure.<p>Genode Architecture draws from Nizza etc at Dresden\n<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/sartakov/genode-architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/sartakov/genode-architecture</a><p>Note: Different enough from traditional that I&#x27;d love to see formal analysis of their model by external parties. Could be issues there. However, they keep to ease modelling of overall thing and using where possible components designed specifically for secure operation. That&#x27;s rare in OSS projects.<p>Muen Separation Kernel\n<a href=""http://muen.sk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://muen.sk/</a><p>Note: Fiasco.OC and seL4 are others. I know this one has been ported into GenodeOS, though.<p>So, I hope those links paint an overall picture for you. Security of a solution against strong attackers depends on the underlying foundation. Is it trustworthy on its own? Does the use of it facilitate easy or difficult security? Historically, the security kernels and capability systems did really well on making secure operation, at least containment, be easier to pull off. UNIX-like and monolithic architectures made it horribly difficult with several attempts at secure, compatible UNIX failing.<p>Xen itself borrows some principles from more robust systems but wasn&#x27;t and still isn&#x27;t designed like security kernels. It also doesn&#x27;t integrate much out of high-security research although some researchers still add improvements. Qubes builds on it & will inherit some of its risks. GenodeOS is designed a bit more like security/separation kernels. It does borrow plenty from high-security research, including underlying kernels. So, although <i>actual</i> assurance varies, architectures like GenodeOS building on high-assurance components have <i>much higher</i> potential for eventual security than architectures like QubesOS building on low-to-medium-assurance platforms.<p>And this isn&#x27;t even counting the number of application-layer issues that show up within a partition. The MILS, OKL4 CAMKES, GenodeOS, etc methods of splitting applications between partitions w/ protected communications is very important for that use case. E language is a good example on capability-security side. Gotta protect trusted part or secrets from untrusted part (esp transport or UI). Mandatory access controls or CMW-style features within the partition can also help but they&#x27;re fighting weaker attackers. So, these are overall the kinds of things I think about when evaluating platforms like this.<p>Pro tip: look at underlying platform, design principles, security architecture, and assurance activities first. If these fail, then what depends on them fails. Most security-oriented tech builds on foundations of quicksand. Things built that way typically sink under weight of strong attacks.<p>EDIT: I just noticed your edit after doing this research and write-up. Fortunately, I think it still addresses it. Talk about preemption. :)",1454265968

For so many people (I say this now being married to a psychologist of my own) including myself are diagnosed with disorders of extremely variable diagnostic validity at extremely young ages (beyond even what the DSM, with its already spotty contents, would recommend) and then medicated past functionality and/or told we have something wrong with us.<p>What would have helped me?

It has been recently theorized that methodologies they used to hurl great stones across the desert required far fewer laborers. By pouring water in front of the stones, the desert sand would become slippery, and thus much much fewer people would be needed for the task. (Early estimates was that it took ~100k people to build a pyramid. Modern estimates point at only ~10k, based on newly found food consumption records)<p>IE: The Pyramids were more akin to the Great Cathedrals across Europe: 100 or 200 year projects completed by generations of engineers, architects, and artists. Not necessarily the elites of society... but at least those with free will.

But on the flip side, one of the historical aspects of universities is supposedly intellectual freedom. And in the sense that faculty might feel a chilling effect on their intellectual freedom if they know or suspect everything this type of monitoring, monitoring might be less acceptable.<p>When it comes to students, this argument is perhaps less clear. The students are not employees.

If this is the case, then you would be the troll in the conversation.  It&#x27;s just how I personally read your comment.<p>But before we get ahead of ourselves - is this a future argument (are you ahead of your time), or has it started to be an issue already?  can you give references?<p>Sorry if I was hard in the middle paragraph, I&#x27;ve just literally never heard of a 3D printing copyright troll.  I&#x27;ve just googled it and got some hypothetical articles from 2012.<p>My own perspective is that society has a choice between, on the one hand: (A) letting some designer put 5,000 hours of work into designing something intricate thing that grants people huge amounts of utility, it&#x27;s a fanstatic achievement that costs you $0.27 in plastic to print at home and gives you real benefits - but they rae  charging $4.99 on Steam for the privilege, while addressing some level of piracy;  and (B) on the one hand, the status quo where you don&#x27;t get the utility (let&#x27;s value at it $80) from the $0.27 piece of plastic, because nobody has designed it for you.<p>It seems to me right now the status quo is (B).  Obviously lots of great stuff could be made and 3d printed for pennies, that nobody has designed.  Some guy designed a fully working tourbillon watch.  (more like clock) Look at how he brazenly puts his name/logo on it <a href=""http://hackaday.com/2016/01/11/3d-printed-tourbillon-clock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackaday.com/2016/01/11/3d-printed-tourbillon-clock/</a><p>Do you think he shouldn&#x27;t have any level of copyright protection on these projects, if he wants it?

It&#x27;s an expressive, high level language, which makes being explicit about error handling very easy, the type system makes it a lot easier to guarantee at compile time that a number of errors possible in dynamic languages will never happen, and it&#x27;s quite efficient.<p>The efficiency and explicit memory ownership in Rust makes it a lot easier to avoid some of the scalability problems you run into in dynamic languages. The amount of material you can find online on people discussing hunting down memory leaks in Rails, or discussing how they just scale up by throwing gobs of RAM and extra servers at the problem or restarting their app every day or two, is all stuff that is much easier to avoid in a language like Rust. It is possible to leak memory in Rust, but due to how explicit you are about how memory is owned, it&#x27;s less likely and more likely to be easier to track down if you do.<p>It is a bit more conceptual overhead to learn Rust than many dynamic languages, but I think that overhead is well spent as it can pay off in performance, stability, and maintainability later on.",1454263823

I was raised by conservative, psychiatrophobic parents and I never got the help I needed until after college. I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s. I was lucky to have the meta-cognitive awareness needed to identify that something was wrong, and that it had gotten worse. After recently getting care from a professional my quality of life and productivity improved across the board. It almost breaks my heart how much it has helped me. I feel as if I could have been so much more successful in academia. I definitely would have led less of guilt-ridden academic life.<p>Even if you do not have anxiety, major depression, or other disorder - I think basic psychological therapy is something almost anyone can benefit from. We like to think friends and family are all we need for help during a rough time or troubling period, but, no matter how well intentioned they might be, they are usually the least qualified to help you. It&#x27;s important to have a professional to talk to in these situations. With children this is even more so.<p>Psychiatrists can see the red-flags that others often ignore, or brush off as personality quirks. This was the case with me for long time. I would have had a better academic life if the &quot;ADD is bullshit&quot; meme never happened. For me, this prevalent mentality prevented me from receiving the health-care I needed, especially with regards to my very private (and personally shameful) crippling anxiety. I hope one day basic psychological check ups for children become as routine as a dentist visits. There are so many benefits to keeping tabs on your mental health and the only downside is the current social stigma.<p>If your child is acting up, consistently has trouble with areas such as organization, or is all over the place with grades - please don&#x27;t assume he or she is lazy or doesn&#x27;t want to succeed. Help them by taking them to someone who can see things you cannot, and possibly find an easily solvable underlying problem.",1454263784

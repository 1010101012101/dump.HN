7181640,comment,7180012,7180012,1,0,ascotan,,,"Angular has it&#x27;s ups and downs like every framework.<p>One of the core issues with angular is maintainability imho.  There are few best practices and almost no documentation on proper project layout. You can also build an application any which way you please. Want state in your controller? Sounds good. Want to build an app with nothing but directives?  Sure.  Inline all your HTML into your directives? yes please. Hell, in theory you could build an entire site out of comments using &#x27;M&#x27; type directives. Of course the code base will be a bit of a mess - but it still makes great eye candy.<p>Another issue with angular is that you&#x27;re frequently doing a deep dive into how angular is built.  Want a recursive directive built in the compile phase?  Uh oh, my screen locked up. Pass a &#x27;&&#x27; scope method into a nested directive?  Hmm, does angular wrap that in a getParent()?? Do I need to double bind the parent callback using &#x27;=&#x27; in the nested call? There is WAY to much need to understand the compile and link phase.  My unit tests for $q promises don&#x27;t fire because they only resolve on a $digest cycle? Uh, how does that work again?<p>It&#x27;s a great attempt to build a front end MVC. It definitely speeds up development time and it enforces the IDEA of testing your javascript at a least (a concept foreign to most jquery developers). However, it&#x27;s still miles from being an ideal front end framework imho.",1391569170

7181578,comment,7174317,7174317,1,0,chrissyb,,,"I&#x27;m creating <a href=""http://www.dwgdrop.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dwgdrop.com</a> (soon to be DrawVault) we are currently about one month away from a V1.0 launch.<p>Interestingly in answer to your question i&#x27;m building an application in the non-developer space as a non developer. I work in the architecture industry & my app is aimed at providing architects, engineers, building contractors and other related fields with an easy way to send and receive drawings and files, and also keep track of revisions to those files. Effectively its a repo for architectural & engineering drawings. I came up with the idea by employing 37 Signals style &quot;scratch your own itch&quot; method. While searching for a solution to replace the tedium of sending through email and local filing that seems commonplace in the industry i found platforms that are similar available for very large scale construction (read 100m, 1b etc) works but didn&#x27;t scale well enough to be a viable option (price-wise) for small scale to include projects in the order of 500k - 5m etc.<p>I think that we hear and talk about &quot;scaling&quot; in the start-up community but we often overlook the possibility of building apps that &quot;scale down&quot; features from a much larger successful software. These smaller apps could theoretically have an untapped access to consumers/businesses that are out-priced by larger software systems.<p>*Edited for clarity",1391567893

The APIs were accessible and libraries and technologies played with each other.  Mostly because they were around some common lower denominator (e.g. a C or lower level API).  You could install anyone&#x27;s software without needing an intermediary.  It was clear that you owned your device, you owned your software and you owned your data.

At the low end, the sporadic nature of legal work makes it difficult to charge much less than lawyers already do. If you&#x27;re doing divorces, child custody, DUI, etc, it&#x27;s very hard to fill 40 billable hours a week because any given matter is so small. You spend most of your time just finding work or waiting for work. If your utilization is 50%, then a billable rate of $50 per hour translates to probably $20 per hour worked when accounting for overhead, or less than you can make working at Costco. If your utilization is 35%, you have to charge $100 per hour to beat working at Costco. To make this work,bayou have to drive volume, taking on very large numbers of cases and closing them quickly, which requires expensive advertising.<p>At the high end, I do think you&#x27;d see a class of non-JD lawyers, probably MBA&#x27;s. However, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d have larger supply and thus lower prices. Supply is already quite elastic. The Chicago market used to hire about 1,000 new lawyers at large firms per year, and is probably down to 350 today. The elasticity of the supply comes from firms going more or less deeply into the class at the schools from which they hire. If you open the pool up to say MBAs at U Chicago and Northwestern, what happens? The job market becomes more competitive, but supply doesn&#x27;t change. At the end of the day, there are only so many M&A deals happening in Chicago and only so many lawyers are needed to work on them. Indeed, the trend has been in the opposite direction. Over the last decade, technology and an intervening recession have reduced the need for entry level lawyers to perform say due diligence. However, rates have gone up over the decade and have held steady even after the recession, because the reduction in entry level positions has resulted in a reduced supply in the ranks of experienced lawyers.",1391565645

2611425,comment,2611281,2611281,1,0,jasonkolb,,,"Some of the primary arguments he uses against Bitcoin are actually its strengths. Fundamentally, Bitcoins will be in higher demand than dollars because their value will continue to rise instead of fall. This means that goods and services as priced in bitcoins will be discounted compared to dollars, driving their adoption. You can see this same dynamic at work in black markets around the world where the USD is the de facto currency vs the highly unstable local currency.<p>It's all about the ""reserve currency"", which is the currency that sellers around the world prefer to receive. If bitcoins are more attractive to sellers because of built-in deflation then they'll not only accept them but offer their products at a discount to get them. All of this creates an ecosystem and drives adoption, it does not make the currency a scam as he implies.",1307012189

2611356,comment,2611192,2611192,16,0,Argorak,,,"Nice collection of examples.<p>But: I am still struggling with that talk about 'expressiveness' that seems to take hold of every programming piece. To take his first example: To anyone who has an advanced programming vocabulary, his notion of ""expressiveness"" thing can be reversed. If I read code like this:<p><pre><code>    i * 2 for i in [1..10]\n</code></pre>\nI immediately think: ""Well, this is a `map`, why doesn't he spell it out?"". So my personal ""expressive"" version is the following:<p><pre><code>    [1..10].map (i) -> i*2\n</code></pre>\nIn my opinion, it is also clearer, because it can be read from left to right.<p>I do understand that this might not be the case for other people, but that doesn't make the one option 'more expressive' then the other.<p>Actually, in the long examples, I find the suffix version extremely odd:<p><pre><code>    console.log ""Happy Birthday #{if i is 3 then ""dear Robert"" else ""to You""}"" for i in [1..4]\n</code></pre>\nI have to read the whole line before I actually find out that this is an iteration.

2611335,comment,2610145,2610750,5,0,jmtame,,,"Interesting excerpt from Startups Open Sourced on this:<p><i>Q: How long did it take to get the beta version of reddit built?</i><p>I think we launched in June, a little less than a month after we got started. It was a really rough version of the site and it was basically a version that we just finally got online because it was tough. It's not like there were a lot of people clamoring to see what we were about to do. We were just two random kids out of UVA. There were people who were curious to see what Y Combinator was going to produce, and it helped being the first YC company to launch.<p>To get that initial traction we benefited from those Paul Graham fans that were just curious about what Paul was doing, what YC was doing, and Paul made sure to mention us whenever he was talking about Y Combinator. A couple of his early essays helped out because he would link to us and, certainly, having Paul Graham readers as your first users on a social news website is a great asset, because the links that they are going to submit are generally high quality and pretty thoughtful and so it sets the tone very nicely.\nAs for growing it outside of that, I begged a lot of my friends and I definitely emailed that old list of folks from that PHPBB forum, announcing it. But the rest of it was just a lot of grunt work. Every time someone wrote a blog entry about redditand this is, of course, pre-Twittergood or bad, I was going to leave a comment there and engage them, talk to them, make a note of them. I just worked my way up the food chain, so to speak. The funny thing is, nowadays, TechCrunch is considered the place to launch your site. reddit never got a single mention on TechCrunch until the day we got acquired.<p>I always stress to startups that they shouldn't be building and working for TechCrunch appearances because those don't really mean anything in the end. You can still have a successful startup without ever having a write-up on TechCrunch, for instance.<p><i>Q: Did you build fake accounts to get user growth early on?</i><p>Yes, I've said this publicly, usually to some laughter. It certainly helped. This was also one of those things that fell within the purview of the non-technical founder. Steve made this nifty little waya form fieldfor us to just type in a random username that came to mind, along with the URL, and the title, and that's who it would be submitted by. That definitely helped, but it really only mattered for the first three weeks, and then there was some point when Steve and I didn't actually have to do anything, and we were so thrilled.<p>We didn't have to submit or vote; there was no commenting back then. The site just worked, and the trick with a social site, especially one like reddit, is: if people come to it and it's empty, the incentive for them to want to contribute to it is really, really low, especially when it's a totally new thing. Even now, when new reddits are created all the time, it's really tough to feel interested in submitting to a lonely, empty new reddit, but once there is a little bit of momentum, once there's a few new users, there is some social proof and this is now what, six years later?<p>Back then you show someone an empty reddit and they just see a blank website and they can't even comprehend what or why they should ever consider participating in this, so I really have no qualms about having done that, in the beginning. It would have been a different story if we had commenting and I was writing comments like, What a brilliant comment, Alexis, your genius is unmatched! That would have been crossing the line. And obviously fake.",1307009406

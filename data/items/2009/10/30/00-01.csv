This could be a red flag in itself but we had met twice before and I had learned that he graduated from the same school as I and around the same time I did and we knew some people in common. Additionally, he had given me a paper of his to read which was pretty decent and said he would like feedback. In general, he seemed like an enlightened techie who was enthusiastic about our technology and technology in general. There seemed to be no red flags.<p>The first time I met him, we discussed his paper and our project in general and he was generally encouraging, saying his organization could be very bureaucratic but he really believed what we were doing was the future and he would pull for us. He also indicated he was stifled in his job and would be interested in working for us in the future. This was a bit of a red flag but considering our connections outside of this project, it seemed like it could be an innocent thing. I told him that if he decided to leave his employer he should let me know and that we were at least a few months away from thinking seriously about hiring someone with his skills.<p>When I met him the second time, he out and out suggested that we pay him to push our project through and, when I told him his employer would most likely find that objectionable, he suggested various ways of hiding it. I was too shocked to say anything, afraid he would sabotage us if I said no to his face and insulted him and the only thing I could say to him was that my cofounder is very by the book and I really have to run it past him and that he should double check to find if it is actually allowed.<p>I have no intention of paying him or dealing with him again, but I feel dirty for not telling him off on his face. I am just posting this here to vent and see if anyone else has faced similar issues. How did you deal with them? Any advice for me?<p>How could I have handled this better? I am asking this seriously.

911259,comment,910626,910626,0,0,willwagner,,,"In the SF Bay Area, I lived on a sailboat for about 5 years.  Living in a constricted space like that definitely takes some time to get used to, but I enjoyed the experience quite a bit.  Sailboats are great if you want to break the habit of keeping a lot of possessions; I had my own rule that I would always be able to get the boat ready to sail within 30 minutes which meant that everything I owned always had to be either tied down or stored in a cabinet somewhere.  Keeping a space that small clean was pretty easy.<p>I was a liveaboard in one of the marinas in So. San Francisco, so I did all my showering, etc. using the public facilities. One perk I gave myself was using cleaners for getting my clothes washed, which regardless of where you live, is pretty awesome.<p>I hadn't ever sailed prior to buying a boat but I spent 4-6 weeks taking group lessons and reading up on boats, and by the time I was done with my class, I had purchased a boat and was moving in.  There is a lot to learn not only on how to sail but deciding what type and model to purchase.<p>The winters kind of sucked; it can be a little bumpy and really noisy when there is a storm, and walking 500 feet or so to the public bathrooms each morning in the rain isn't all that fun. The rest of the year was great though and I did spend quite a few years sailing around the bay on weekends.<p>Sailing is definitely a cool sport for hackers who like to know how things work and get optimal results.  It's an interesting mix of science and history.<p>I'd definitely recommend it for a single person in high tech if they are so interested (unless they have a propensity to get seasick).",1256863001

You can appoint people as admins to choose the most promising translations, or you can just trust the community's votes.<p>This sounds great in theory, but there are a few problems.  I don't want to go into too much detail, but to summarize:<p>- Facebook is extremely unresponsive to bugs and questions (admittedly, it's in beta).<p>- Facebook requires would-be translators to have had a Facebook account for a secret amount of time before they can translate.  Many international people do not have an account.<p>- The Facebook UI is unsuitable for bulk translation.<p>So, are there any alternatives for crowd-sourcing translations, or is this one of those problems where every startup rolls their own solution?",1256862941

Yes, it's light on content, but I just went live - does the site somehow communicate its intended values?  would you use a site like this?",1256861699

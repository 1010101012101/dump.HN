Is it really full of readers and intellectualists, people that take pride in knowledge and are aloof from the mundane?<p>No.<p>> This is an interesting situation: put the people you're most likely to enjoy a good, thought-provoking, intellectual, factually-backed, philosophical conversation in a car together... where they take a vow of silence for the duration of the ride.<p>Perhaps the worst place imaginable to find interesting conversation is in groups of self-selected ""intelligentsia"".  People talking to each other who are getting a sense of validation from sounding clever leads to the kind of drivel that makes Ayn Rand fans over-excitable, and other people despair of the state of humanity.<p>If you're looking for thought-provoking and intelligent conversation, cultivate a group of friends who you like listening to, but at NO POINT advertise it as some kind of salon. If you're in a big city, there are often large groups of people who work in finance with brains the size of planets, and absolutely no intellectual outlet. I have had great success with ""dinner clubs"" where the stated aim is to eat good food and drink nice wine... Alternatively I have been led to thoughts of homicide by people gathering to have ""clever conversations"".",1353311794

4803385,comment,4803196,4803196,9,0,hayksaakian,,,"Facebook is fully entitled to enforce edgerank. People consume content differently on FB than say twitter. Since twitter is more of a firehouse, its OK to simply sort by date since newness has much more value in that ecosystem. This is socially acknowledged given that tweets are firstly public. In contrast Facebook presents itself as a local social network. As such, your relationships on FB carry more weight. Social pressure nudges us to 'friend' mere acquaintances and 'like' things that are mildly amusing. You're expected to acknowledge important news in your social circles. Edgerank reinforces this behavior. If something is deemed 'like'able by your 'friends' you're encouraged to also like it, both by the algorithm and social influences, thus perpetuating the cycle to your own network.<p>Brands don't fit into this picture. You don't 'like' a picture of coca cola from a crazy party at mcdonalds' house. Your interactions on the comments of posts by a brand are probably one way, and with predominantly strangers. The rest of your personal network is unrelated.<p>Thus, sponsored posts work against edge rank. There are two big examples of sponsored posts. First is say, promoting a personal story or life event (it's a boy!). Second is corporate to consumer say, Best Buy is having a huge sale on something. In the first case if a story is truly important it would have been picked up by the algorithm and social forces alike. In the second, most people don't believe corporations are people, and their social interactions with them are typically unwelcome to their personal network. There's no social pressure to like a picture of Jones soda's new flavor as opposed to Jenny's new baby.<p>All in all, I think mark is right for the wrong reasons. FB's business model runs counter to its primary product offering. They're still experimenting and I hope they end up with something that makes sense to a social network.",1353311591

This makes it a lot harder to just jump in and get started by calling on host (Javascript) libraries to get stuff done.  Combine this with the fact that there aren't so many pure ClojureScript libraries and wrapper-libraries available (relatively speaking), and productivity is a bit stunted.<p>All of that said, I think ClojureScript has as much potential as Clojure on the JVM and I look forward to things improving as the ecosystem matures.  It is wonderful to write Clojure and control the client, and I think that those people who can fight their way through (what I found to be) the unfortunately steep getting-started curve will have a hard time going back to vanilla JS.",1353311545

I just think they are going to be pushing metro (or whatever it is called now) pretty hard, and if you don't like metro-style apps, they are going to be harder and harder to avoid as time goes by.<p>I just think that app stores are going to be more and more important to the ecosystems they exist in. For the reasons I mentioned above, I think more and more software is going to be procured via app stores (although, in big businesses it will probably be fairly small), and that is going to influence what developers build.<p>I probably wouldn't have built and sold a Mac app if there weren't an app store, and as I look at porting it to Windows, trying to replicate the infrastructure that I get for free with an app store isn't very appealing for the amount of money I'd likely make, so my choices are: make a metro-style app so I can use the Windows app store or not make the app at all.<p>> Perhaps that is simply something we'll agree to disagree on?<p>Fair enough :)",1353311383

I am using this beast for several months (adding the beta releases to the queue) and although I was very sceptic and using the same words with Mr. Nielsen as in the UI is schizophrenic and tries to be two things in one shell BUT you know what? If you are not interested, you don't even see Metro (or whatever its post copyright lawsuit codename is). It doesn't get between your legs, it wasn't always so; my memory did record some awful experiences with CP and RC releases of Windows 8. But the release version is... good, surprisingly. I expect windows 9 will streamline it even more.<p>I agree that opening two browsers in desktop mode and in tablet mode can be a hassle towards users' memories but hey my workflow makes me using two different browsers in two virtual desktops so I was happy to have this feature without loading a virtual desktop app for windows.<p>""Lack of multiple windows"" um... what? I am running a netbeans, firefox and several consoles running tweaker script programs in ruby at the moment. Of course if he meant the Metro interface, I can't see why do you expect multiple windows on a tablet interface.<p>And from there I felt like the article goes irrelevant and subjective. I had no problems with flat icons, and to be frank I found the news app the best of the bunch. It does not oversaturate you with the content and is blazing fast. As for live tiles, how can third party developers' choice can be accounted as a failure on Windows 8's usability? I mean if his criticisms were about the Microsoft Apps I would have accepted it but it's saying like  ""oh iPhone apps icons are too colorful. Shame on you Apple!""<p>All in all there is a weird tendency of bashing windows 8 in the press. And it doesn't deserve it.

4803363,comment,4802849,4803200,6,0,cookiecaper,,,"Not only do long copyright terms not incent creativity, they actually diminish the motive for creative people. Once they get one well-paying license attributed to their ownership, they can live off of it the rest of their lives -- and not only the creator/rightsholder, but generally multiple generations of his progeny. In a fair-but-reasonable world of copyright terms, one would be free to hold a monopoly on his creation for several years and make plenty of money off of it (in some cases, more money than anyone could need), but if a dependence on the government-granted monopoly was still important to the rightsholder after 10-15 years, he would be incentivized to create new stuff. His progeny would also be so incentivized, instead of living off their forefathers' work for 3+ generations and never needing to contribute anything themselves. This also means that works can enter the public domain while they're still relevant; with reasonable copyright terms, Star Wars would be entering the public domain.

So I'm going to be a bit brief on some things, and if you feel that I didn't address an important point let me know and I'll circle back to it. Feel free to do the same. Plus it's getting late and i don't expect you'll see this until tomorrow.<p>Not supporting restrictions on free speech doesn't mean you're only worried about your own ability to voice your opinions. You (and I) both support rights and protections for groups of people that may not impact us directly.<p>I think surveillance / warrantless wiretapping demonstrates the opposite effect: small, seemingly reasonable extensions of surveillance & a less-than-absolutist view of the importance of the right to privacy are what led to the problem.<p>I agree with you on the diagnosis of the problem (the ease of hatred, human cognitive biases against outsiders, etc). I still think the solution is education (even state-sponsored anti-racism education is fine by me) and more speech disclaiming the things you disagree with rather than criminalizing it. I think you can demonstrate institutional opposition to racism in other ways that aren't in such direct opposition to the free exchange of ideas.<p>I agree that transphobia is a problem, but as you might have guessed, I don't think hate speech laws are the right solution. I too am a fan of QC.<p>You say that hate speech causes great harm to society, and I agree. There are plenty of other things that I think cause great harm to society. People that oppose gay marriage believe that it does great harm to society. Believing that someone else expressing themselves is causing harm doesn't mean we should criminalize the expression of their ideas.<p>I, too, have great trust in the Canadian government and judicial system (although I'm American). But I don't trust that they are always right. And that's what you're basically claiming when you criminalize speech that you don't agree with. Those laws will never be repealed. Any attempt to do so would just end with any supporters being called racist. You're claiming that you're know 100% that you are right, and are thus making speech contrary to your opinions illegal. As I mentioned before, what if people 50 years ago had the same ideas as you do about the non-absolute nature of free speech? They were probably just as sure that gay marriage is wrong as you are that racism is wrong. But they didn't codify a ban on pro- gay rights speech into law, thank god. Here's another human cognitive bias: we all think we're right, and that we know the right thing to do. But what if we're wrong? That's a question you have to ask yourself. Your system of government has to take that into account.<p>Finally, I want to take a second to talk about the purpose of free speech. It's not just so that anyone can say whatever the hell they want and damn the consequences! Free speech is there to prevent atrocities. It's there to prevent genocides, wars, oppression, and corruption. Free speech helps to protect democracy. That's why it's so important. That's why I am absolutist in my support of free speech.

After about 30 seconds, I killed the vm and switched to Ubuntu 12 server.<p>I don't care if SmartOS is 'faster' or has dtrace. The fact that it is missing basic things like top (no prstat isn't anything close to top) and 'standard' things like upstart made me want to run for the hills. The Joyent wiki documentation on SmartOS is abysmal at best. Even the pkgsrc repository system feels ancient and pales in comparison to what apt is. I have no desire to spend time re-inventing basic tools that linux has had for ages.<p>The image version of SmartOS w/ NodeJS isn't up-to-date with the latest Node release and it starts up MongoDB by default. While this may be good for just getting things running quickly, what happens if I don't want Mongo running at all? Generate my own images? No thanks.<p>I know, lots of hate... but it isn't all bad.

As the bond has a low coupon, there is little incentive for the government to redeem it. Unlike most gilts, which pay coupons semi-annually, Consols pay coupons four times a year because of their age. As a result of their uncertain redemption dates, they are typically treated as a perpetual bond.<p>...<p>Given their long history, references to Consols can be found in many places, including literature such as Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, Howards End by E.

In the winter, it would get so dark that I couldn't see my hand before my eyes, and couldn't hear a single sound. Actually this had some strange effects on me, being sort of a sleep walker and all. I would often wake up in the middle of the night being confused, not knowing where I was. I had to feel my bed, find the floor, the walls, the furniture, until I finally come to my senses and realize where I was. Kind of like sensory deprivation. It never happens nowadays, when I live in a city, because it never gets completely dark. Not really on topic, but thought it might be interesting, maybe others have had the same experience.

4803265,comment,4801691,4801985,1,0,grosskur,,,"I find setuptools works great for packaging whole apps with HTML/JS/CSS. You can put these data files in your Python package directory, list them in MANIFEST.in, and set 'include_package_data=True' in setup.py. Then you can reference them in your code relative to __file__. And you can include a run script for your app using 'scripts' in setup.py, or let setuptools generate it using 'entry_points'.<p>Take a look at <a href=""https://github.com/getsentry/sentry"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/getsentry/sentry</a> for a good example. After doing 'pip install sentry', you can run the included gunicorn-based HTTP server via bin/sentry ('sentry init && sentry start'). A uWSGI-based server would have worked, too.<p>I like to create a virtualenv under /opt, install the package and its dependencies with pip, and then run fpm to create an RPM or DEB. Then I use Chef or Puppet to install the package, deploy config files, deploy a service script (for upstart or daemontools), and enable the service.<p>See also <a href=""http://www.12factor.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.12factor.net/</a> for some principles on how to structure your app. These can be applied whether or not you use setuptools. For example, Heroku's Python buildpack will deploy your 12-factor app in-place using requirements.txt and Procfile in your app root, ignoring setup.py. I find 12-factor apps are easier to deploy whatever method you choose, since configs/services/logs are cleanly separated from your app itself.",1353308427

Plus, I interview well. People still give me jobs.<p>Managers don't seem to have a response here. In my experience most managers only have one bit of information devoted to programmer ability (ROCKSTAR xor SUCKS). They have alternately told me to try harder, or threatened then fired me.<p>I had felt like I was deceiving employers so I took a nine month break and did an artistic project. However even with a whole day to do nothing but that, I wasn't able to achieve much. I worked with a small number of people and lef that project, and it got done, but not very well, even though it was my ""full time"" job. Still, I felt that I had had enough of a sabbatical, and also had made some progress in psychotherapy, so I returned to the workforce, only to run into the same problems I had before. I now think the psychotherapy was not addressing the right problems -- it's more about what I <i>do</i> than how I <i>feel</i>. And it's clear my attempt at a sabbatical didn't clear up the fundamental issues.<p>I have friends that are able to learn programming languages on the side or take blacksmithing courses and otherwise have full and exciting lives. In other words they have reserve energy. I am so behind on just the basic requirements for my project, I feel I can't do any of this. I schedule more and more and more and more time for work and yet still nothing gets done.<p>As for happiness with work; I have a pattern of working with codebases that are in great need of refactoring and I am feeling a great need to stretch out and do something more original. So that is a problem.<p>That said, the guy who sits next to me has enough energy to actually satisfy those needs both at work (gets managers to agree to major refactorings) and also code up some great things in his spare time.

1762888,comment,1760585,1762413,0,0,tjmc,,,"The idea of simply creating a different distribution mechanism (eg CDBaby) for unsigned artists so that they don't have to sign with a major label is popular with the tech crowd, but fundamentally flawed. It assumes that unsigned artists can all produce well recorded, <i>popular</i> music on their own.<p>Most can't.<p>A good producer can pick a rough artist or band and get something popular out of them, but it often involves both mentoring and investment in recording and promotion upfront before any opportunity of return. Note I deliberately use the word ""popular"" rather than ""good"" (which is subjective anyway) because clearly as a business ""popular"" is where the money is. The ""long tail"" theory is fiction. Music is a hits business where most of the money is made by a relatively short fat body of popular music.<p>Many of the most popular ""artists"" are created from scratch <i>by</i> producers. Where do you think Britney and the Spice Girls came from? Like them or not, the revenue from hit music funds the production of new acts who haven't become profitable yet.<p>Another flawed assumption is that everyone wants to listen to <i>new</i> music. A lot don't. So you have a large body of recorded music that the record labels will never give up or let you sample or remix without a hefty toll. And as soon as any new act gets popular, you can bet they'll be offered a seat at the ""big 4"" music table. It's the DeBeers business model applied to music.<p>Personally, I think what the radio station JJJ in Australia does with their unearthed site (<a href=""http://triplejunearthed.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://triplejunearthed.com/</a>) is an excellent model for identifying quality artists. The next step IMHO is a ycombinator style production startup company that invests in developing the most promising acts to become popular and then offers all the recording, promotion, management and touring services that the labels do but on just terms. Distribution is just the last piece of the puzzle.",1286344237

It would be interesting if this were true. I bet your question reduces approximately to, ""Was Ward Cunningham a Forth hacker?""<p>Moore was influenced by both APL and (especially) Lisp, which he studied with McCarthy. But Forth predates Smalltalk, and the two moved in very different circles. Still do I guess.<p>While I'm at it, I've been meaning to write the following down somewhere. Out of the great small, regular languages (Lisp, Smalltalk, APL, Forth, is that it?) Forth stands out as the only one that originated in working hackerdom and not a research environment. Forth is the incarnation of that design style in the land of the Von Neumann architecture, doubtless because Moore was a working programmer all those years, just trying to get things done. The remarkability of this fact has yet to be appreciated. Consider Lisp by contrast: it began existence far away from the machine and has been trying to find its way back ever since (or bring the machine up to it). With Lisp, bottom-up programming nonetheless starts pretty high up; Forth starts at rock bottom. That's important, and I wish more of us (myself included) had a better grasp of it. One could do worse than to make it the introduction to computing, or at least teach it alongside Scheme/Python/etc. I think it would be very exciting to young hackers to begin at the beginning in this way.",1286342122

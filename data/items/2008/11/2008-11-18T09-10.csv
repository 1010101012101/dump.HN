The key to a con is not that you trust the conman, but that he shows he trusts you ...""</i><p>The key to this con, a bait & switch, is greed and deception. Another key is deception. If the person is greedy, they just might be willing to tricked into suspending belief thus making deception easier.  It's very hard to con someone who is honest because they aren't looking to gain something for nothing.",1227002096

368084,comment,367212,368069,0,0,Tichy,,,"Funny, my impression was that it is rather Microsoft that also takes care of the little things, whereas Apple seems to be prone to skipping the little things because they might appear too ugly. It's little things like having the right menu options at the right place, ""Open Command Line Here"", stuff like that - have forgotten the details because I haven't used either OS X or Windows in a while. But Windows has usability research groups. I am not sure if Apple even has those, or if they just rely on their fancy designers.",1227001183

It's so difficult to get to interesting/relevant data much of the time. Algorithmic complexity is great, but for my part, I just want to make something good.

368077,comment,367928,368028,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"> ""do it my way or do it with someone else"" is not a protection racket.<p>I totally agree. Perhaps my post was ambiguous as this is exactly what I was trying to say.<p>My comment was not about the <i>law</i> it was about <i>rules</i> set by <i>private institutions</i> - Facebook are not making any <i>laws</i>. I do not know whether (2) and (3) are required by law, but it is irrelevant to the point I was making, which is: Arrington's definition of 'protection racket' would clasify lots of <i>rules</i> that we consider beneficial to society as 'protection rackets', therefore his accusation is unfair.<p>You're quite right in saying that ""..you just have to find folks willing to do the same.."", this applies to (2) (3) and Facebook. I.e. the analogy holds: Just as a porn-star can look for work where STD tests are not required#, developers can choose to not develop for Facebook (or be unverified). If the market of non-STD-requiring-studios / webapps-outside-facebook proves too small to be viable for them then they have to get-the-test/ get-the-app-verified. It's no different. It seems to be that in both these cases the person would be best served by paying the cash to get verified, but it is a free world, so they can choose to do whatever they think best for them.
(# - even if it is the law, they can always go outside the US)<p>> I'm pretty sure that there's no law requiring ""assessment fees and membership fees"" for professional coaches either.<p>There is no law that I am aware of. But the professional bodies of which I am a part all have <i>rules</i> that do involve the payment of fees for accreditation, and I'm glad they do.",1227000373

368068,comment,368007,368057,0,0,markessien,,,"That's not the point. There is a large class of desktop apps that could be programmed in Javascript also. The point is - why would any developer or any development studio bother with investing time and effort in learning Javascript for the iPhone, when you can just invest the time in learning how to use C++?<p>Using Javascript will give you a short-term boost, but at a long term cost. And at some point, when you do switch to the native API, you need to restart learning.<p>The difference in using C++ and javascript on the iphone is pretty small - they have similar syntax and organisation. C++/Obj-C actually has some advantages in terms of speed, because of the much larger availability of sample code and tools to work with it.<p>And of course, there is the native vs intepreted advantage of C++ code.",1226999597

They can throw as many developers at a problem as it takes, and backwards compatibility is one of those problems they've chosen to focus on since they're used so much in business. Apple can't do that, and it pays a lot less for them. Mac apps tend to be more consumer based, which means backwards compatibility isn't nearly as important.",1226999076

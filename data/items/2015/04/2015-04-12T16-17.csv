9363928,comment,9332775,9344001,0,0,amazon_not,,,"> what if mobile carriers where not allowed to discriminate whom they could sell zero-rated services to, so each service provider/app should have the freedom to choose the business model that works best for themselves?<p>While nominally better, it would just be like putting lipstick on a pig. There would also be serious real world problems with actually enforing such a regimen.<p>> what if 3rd parties where allowed to buy zero-rated URLs or IPs in &quot;bulk&quot; from all the carriers in a geography, making it much easier to contract all mobile carriers?<p>My answer is pretty much the same as above, only this one is a bit more ambitious. It&#x27;s basically like suggesting world peace as a solution to global conflicts. Getting all the carriers in a geographic region on board, implementing, rolling out and enforcing such a thing would almost be an effort worth a Nobel price in itself.<p>> preventing companies to provide zero-rated services increases the digital divide as it inhibit people who cannot afford to buy a data plan to use services. In many areas of the world, the majority of mobile consumers are on pre-paid plans and have zero credits most of the time (most countries have calling party pays, so a smartphone with zero credit is still very valuable to receive calls)<p>Offering zero rating as a solution to this problem is a false choice. Zero rating is providing a means of communication for free AND limiting what it can be used for. The correct choice is to provide the same means of communications for free and NOT limiting what it can be used for. That is how you remove the digital divide.<p>If need be this free mode of communication can be limited by speed or by amount, as is customary in the mobile world. What is not reasonable is to limit what can be done with it.<p>TL;DR zero rating is evil, give users a free tier or quota instead.",1428857770

It&#x27;s not just about making the internet available, it&#x27;s also about teaching the unconnected &#x27;how&#x27; to use it (I feel the UX layer of the internet may be broken for the unconnected) And even more important to teach them &#x27;why&#x27; (i.e: a farmer in some developing rural area might not really care to connect with friends via social networks or download music, however, teaching him how to check the weather online, might just bump his livelihood up a few notches.)

9363902,comment,9362489,9362489,0,0,derekp7,,,"For me, the method I&#x27;ve found most comfortable are snapshot style whole disk backups.  The common go-to solution is rsync/snapshots (ala rsnapshot or similar utilities), which I&#x27;ve used in the past.  However this only does partial deduplication (it deduplicates files that are in the same path from one backckup to the next), and it doesn&#x27;t compress.  So to remedy that I wrote Snebu (<a href=""http://www.snebu.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snebu.com</a>), which stores lzo-compressed files on the target using sha1 hash for the file name (somewhat like Git does), and has an sqlite DB to store the metadata (file paths, ownership, backup set name/date, etc).  Therefore you get full file-level dedup even across multiple clients writing to the same backend.  On the client side, it uses standard GNU find and tar, so you can use it on Windows with the help of Cygwin.  Each backup set has a retention schedule label (daily, weekly, etc) to make it easy to selectively purge old backups (i.e., keep the current 10 daily, 6 weekly, and 12 monthly backups).<p>I&#x27;ve got the client side script tweaked so that you can run it as a standalone setup (backup to a local USB drive), or backup to a remote Linux server via a non-privileged account, or have the remote backup server pull backups from your clients.  The features that are currently in development for the next version include client-side encryption, and pluggable backend replication, so you can replicate your backup sets to cloud providers, or tape, or to another Snebu installation.<p>I can definitely use some more feedback, probably need to do another round of documentation improvements, but overall the code seems quite stable.  The project sites is up on github (github.com/derekp7/snebu) if you are interested in contributing.",1428857359

Then, you reach mid-life, and still want to write code, how do you feel now about your youthful cavalier attitude?<p>If I could travel back in time 20 years and tell myself &quot;dude, someday you&#x27;ll be my age too!&quot; I probably wouldn&#x27;t have done anything differently, but it would be a serious boost to the humility of our young brethren for them to realize that they too will be in our shoes one day--a day that comes far too soon.<p>The thing is, I am actually one of the lucky ones.  I could retire now and never work another day.  Sure I don&#x27;t have a private jet or a house in Atherton, but I have the freedom to walk away from anything and not worry about money.  It&#x27;s liberating, but I certainly don&#x27;t want to stop.  I love programming!  I want to keep working.  And based on the sentiments of those around me, and the nice paycheck I command, it&#x27;s clear I still have a lot to contribute to this economy before I&#x27;m put out to pasture.  But I would like a less toxic enviroment.  Fortunately I don&#x27;t encounter many clueless managers these days.  I simply don&#x27;t work for organizations where decisions would be made to hire youth just to save a few bucks.  But I still encounter the young bucks who think I&#x27;m too expensive and simply there to steal their thunder and take credit for everything.  Just remember kids, someday you will be just like me, if you&#x27;re lucky.<p>We have so little time, don&#x27;t waste any of it comparing yourself to others--young or old.  Treat every day as a competition with yourself... to end the day a little bit smarter, a little wiser, a little bit more humble than you were when the day started.",1428857083

The basic idea is that as the universe was forming, there were concentrations of dark matter.  Standing sound waves of photons and baryons (ordinary matter) formed around these concentrations.  After decoupling, the photons streamed away, but the baryons remained and eventually formed galaxies.  This results in a characteristic pattern seen on the sky, where there are clusters of galaxies observed, and then rings of galaxies around them.<p>It is possible to calculate the physical size of these rings from first principles.  Since you observe how big these rings appear on the sky, you can figure out how far away they are, and from this determine the expansion history of the universe.",1428856659

Terminals are /way/ more flexible, faster, and customizable if that&#x27;s your job and you take the time to learn them.<p>> Can you think of any big things that you lose though?
Definitely.  Customizing behaviors.  I work with image sequences a lot. &quot;ls&quot; is used to list files in a directory &quot;lss&quot; is a command we wrote to group image sequences together.  This makes finding missing images in a sequence, knowing the range, and dealing with 1000&#x27;s of files in a folder trivial.  These are technically possible with a gui, you need to re-write your whole file-browser or have one with some plugin system that support this (I don&#x27;t know of any).<p>> I could probably get between floors in my house an order of magnitude faster if I replaced the stair cases with slides and a trampolines. Somehow, that does not seem practical though.
That&#x27;s a terrible analogy and a half-truth on both sides.  Jumping to the mouse does slow things down, but I use GUI file browsers without a mouse just fine.  The only thing I can&#x27;t do out of the box is resize and move windows around--navigating through directories is fine.<p>> Humans are good at understanding patterns and symbols and they&#x27;re not good at memorizing text commands. That&#x27;s why everybody can use GUIs but few can use a shell.
I think the difference is that guis offer more spacial queues and persistent information than terminals do.  Someone who has never used a computer would be equally confused at how a mouse or scrolling worked.  Humans are not terrible as memorizing text commands, there&#x27;s just no need to use them everyday and a gui is usually good enough.  Fewer people can drive a stick-shift or parallel park now that it&#x27;s generally unnecessary.  It&#x27;s not that it was difficult.

I brought a number of great co-founders in when I started my first virtual reality start-up in 2000. Then of course we all got burned when the markets crashed in 2001. I even managed to convince some of them to return in 2004 when we got a large contract. We built the company into one of the best in the world in virtual reality product in the world. Only to be screwed by a partner with a much much larger legal budget. I have come to realize the contract disputes are usually won by the party with the larger legal budget. At this point they all just want to ride their companies into retirement.",1428855880
9363817,comment,9363627,9363627,0,0,MalcolmDiggs,,,"That&#x27;s how I prefer to structure my apps these days. It lends itself more naturally to the &quot;disposable front-end&quot; idea (a la Guy Kawasaki&#x27;s writings). I prefer to push as much business-logic into the API as I can, and have the client be thin and quick. I also prefer to have the API be rock-solid (well tested, documented, etc) while the front-ends are more experimental and less stable.<p>In the very early stages of a startup (MVP phase) this might arguably be overkill. But as the team grows, you&#x27;ll be happy that the backend and frontend folks are in different repos (as they probably have very different development methodologies). And as your userbase/traffic scales up, you&#x27;ll be able to allocate server resources very efficiently.<p>An added benefit is that (depending on the front-end you use) porting to PhoneGap/Cordova and making a mobile app out of it is a breeze.<p>One word of caution as you jump into single-page front-ends: It&#x27;s worth your time and effort to figure out an elegant SEO solution early on. I prefer prerender.io, but there are many good options.",1428855876

Today&#x27;s great minds are productive for a shorter period of time than they were a century ago.</i><p>I wonder what hypotheses there are for why scientists a century ago were able to be productive earlier. The paper has a few hypotheses that they think are plausible:<p>(1) Distance to the knowledge frontier is rising. Older scientists only needed to know fields A, B, and C to attack D, but to attack E, newer scientists needed to know A, B, C, and D. This is the hypothesis they think is most likely, and they give evidence showing that the age of patent holders and the team size involved in patents has also been increasing.<p>(2) May be harder to get resources to do research now. One has to establish a reputation to win grants to do innovative research, and that takes time. Did research cost less a century ago?<p>My own question: How often does the student that does the Nobel prize winning work win the prize versus it only going to the PI? The involvement of the PI varies wildly. For example, Jocelyn Bell and Antony Hewish wrote the paper that revealed pulsars, but only Hewish (Bell&#x27;s advisor) won the Nobel prize, although Bell made the initial discovery (Hewish had her looking for quasars with the radio telescope).",1428855837

Do you ignore it, or do you use it as an opportunity to learn why someone might say it?",1428854624

Vim is a powerful editor out of the box, but it falls short of many IDE capabilities without leveraging plugins.<p>There are many packages on GitHub that will install and configure Vim for you with a variety of useful plugins and keyboard shortcuts out of the box--so after the installation is complete, you&#x27;ll have a fully fledged Vim IDE ready to use.<p>One of my favorites is Joe Nelson&#x27;s setup [0]. It&#x27;s specific to Haskell development, but even if that&#x27;s not relevant to your use-case, it&#x27;s a very sleek demonstration of what Vim can do as an IDE--and a good starting point for customizing your setup (i.e. a very clean .vimrc file for inspiration). I use it basically as-is for my default Vim config and as a full IDE. Check out the keyboard shortcuts for quickly switching buffers, Git integration, and the shortcuts for visualizing project structure & quickly navigating files.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/begriffs/haskell-vim-now"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/begriffs/haskell-vim-now</a>",1428854610

But people get serious PTSD or sometimes even die from one single 5-minute fight with a cop.<p>Furthermore, I think shunning and blacklisting should be a protected form of individual choice. For example, I&#x27;m just not going to hang out with someone that&#x27;s a racist. That is and should be 100% my choice. But I don&#x27;t have a right to  physically harm them. I&#x27;ll argue that this arrangement of making violence special and different from harsh-words or shunning will make for a more functional society because we don&#x27;t always all have to agree but we can still live in one place together.",1428854609

What I was taught might be a better way to understand it is very close to what you stated.  If a person can doubt the existence of everything then certainly they could doubt even the existence of themselves. Once one starts down a path of doubting then certainly everything is subject to scrutiny.  What one cannot doubt is the fact they are doubting.  So perhaps the quote should be better paraphrased as &quot;I doubt therefor I am&quot;.  Ive always found that helpful and while it seems you understand that point very well I just thought Id mention it because prior to such an explanation the process by which one affirms there existence because they think never made much sense to me.",1428854493

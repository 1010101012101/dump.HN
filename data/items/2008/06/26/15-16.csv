228721,comment,227249,228407,0,0,Hexstream,,,"In most documents, the number of tags that fit in a screenful <i></i>completely<i></i> dwarfs the number of tags that don't. So it makes sense to optimize for the former case. And I don't think forcing redundance everywhere is a proper way to ""make it 'easier' to edit"".<p>You seem to worry about counting closing parentheses but with s-expressions you don't count parentheses. You just look at indentation and the structure emerges.<p>I just don't buy the ""XML should be writable without a proper editor"" argument. Why optimize for the couple clueless fools that will try to edit it in NotePad if it hampers the work of the tons of people who actually need to edit lots of XML and actually use a proper editor? Using a proper editor also fixes the undirected quotes problem. Besides, s-expressions might even work better than XML in NotePad because you don't have to indent the end tag because it's just a closing parenthesis that you don't indent.",1214495888

He wasn't asking himself mathematical questions. He wasn't doing math competitions. He had no knowledge outside of what was taught in school to students at his grade level. This is freakishly uncommon, but he shows it's possible.<p>25 is young. He is just a few years into his PhD, and he hasn't made many major achievements (he's been a grader for the IMO, written one paper that's still being refereed for publication).

228703,comment,228581,228632,0,0,mihasya,,,"I disagree with you on many points there. I'm not sure what you work on, but the bottleneck in my experience is almost always the database.<p>Doing 1:1 web to db setup is not a good idea because more than likely you'll end up under utilizing the web servers as they will outpace the db (unless your db has one three-column table in it of course). Even if it's the other way around, you're still handcuffing whichever server is faster/under less load. Every time, say, a DB server is overloaded, instead of just adding another DB server, you have to add TWO servers.<p>Also, this ends up being sort of sloppy b/c the subdomain for your website changes by user once they've logged in. What happens when one user pastes a link to something he saw to the other user? You have to figure out how to handle that.<p>To the OP: I have recently been looking around for similar things and, as expected, this is a very specific problem that hasn't been tackled (or certainly tackled well) by that many websites. In any case, there is no cookbook solution for it. It is probably a good thing, since your needs in this case will likely be very specific. You are most likely going to have to go it alone.<p>I have yet to implement this in practice, but my approach would be to have a single DB master that just has the shard allocating table (make sure to cache the shit out of that, hopefully using your app server's local cache, though I don't know if RoR has something equivalent to PHP's APC, so you don't have to do a lookup on every call) followed by the additional masters. Figure out what you're going to shard by (user id etc). Then you will want to write some sort of algorithm that distributes new content between the existing servers (this will depend on how much content there is per-user; if you are sharing something that is database intense and each user has many of it, tying users to a single shard could lead to that shard getting screwed by a few super active users, so you may want to shard on a more finegrained level than that). At first, you will probably just have to assign new shards based on how many shards are on the servers you currently have (as you add an empty server, all new shards go to that), but I would recommend overtime implementing something that uses actual db server load or some other statistic that is actually more telling of how much work each db server is doing to distribute.<p>As your DB grows (in terms of adding tables), I'd make sure to keep a script around that makes moving a shard easy. Basically something where you can put up a ""Your account is under maintenance"" for one user and then just run a script that updates the central allocation database and moves all the data associated with that shard accordingly.<p>I think this goes without saying, but replicate every master both for reads and for failures. You also want memcached in there somewhere, I would assume, but that's another story.<p>As I said, I have yet to actually start implementing this, but this has several advantages. Database servers are easy to add without manipulating your app (especially if your sharding algorithm is good), you can shard according to load, you aren't handcuffing your app servers to a single database server, etc.<p>Hope this helps. Cheers.<p>Edit: you might find some things that will help here:\n<a href=""http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/public/schedule/proceedings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/public/schedule/proceedings</a>\nI can't remember which talks they were, but I saw quite a few people show layouts of approximately how their architecture worked.

228694,comment,228233,228399,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"It would help us avoid expensive mistakes to correct non-problems. Imagine a world in which height is as politically charged as race. Every year, short people rail against the overrepresentation of the tall people in sports, in politics, in film, etc. And every year, the tall people talk about how some of their best friends are short, they themselves aren't prejudiced, they understand there's a horrible legacy of discrimination, perhaps short-person-related affirmative action programs are necessary.<p>But then some annoying researcher points out that of <i>course</i> tall people are better at basketball, because they are closer to the basket (among other things). And that within ethnic groups, height correlates with intelligence because of a confouding variable: malnutrition is known to reduce cognitive ability and height, and cognitive ability correlates very well with income.<p>So it basically transforms something from a political problem to a scientific fact. There is no longer anything to rectify, because everything is as it should be -- people have characteristics that make them better or worse at various tasks, and that's just the way things are. A short person who tries hard can succeed at tall-person fields, but not to the extent that they could if they were tall. A tall person can live a long time if they try hard to be healthy, but not as long as they could if they were short.",1214494000

Unless laws are put into place (and likely even then) engines without computers will always be available, and in the end only criminals and enthusiasts will have ungelded engines. Perhaps the effort will affect a few desperate black carjackers, but not a determined criminal.<p>Only bad can come of this. You can see the real motivation for this push by the fact that terroristm is used as a justification. But although bullshit like this is technologically possible, it's users and politicians (and in the end ""the people"") who determine whether technological features like these will become a curiosity or a straitjacket.

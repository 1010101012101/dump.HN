Our daughter is 2 months away from her 2nd birthday and just in the last month or so, her speech has started accelerating at quite a pace. Whereas from 8 months or so she was making noises and started to form her first words, these days it&#x27;s almost one new word per day, and she&#x27;s starting to make lots of 2 and even 3 word sentences.<p>Another interesting point: we&#x27;re bringing her up to be bi-lingual (Dutch and English), and because her environment is primarily Dutch, almost all of the words she speaks are in Dutch, though she understands a decent share of English too, now. I wonder if because language development is a bit more prolonged with bi-lingual children, if this vulnerable phase is also then prolonged, or if the brain starts to be more resilient as soon as a &quot;first language&quot; is settled in?<p>I love this stuff!",1438858686

(or source code :) )<p>I would say that just because your memory use is deterministic, doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t get garbage.  Garbage is just memory that isn&#x27;t needed any more.<p>for example, in<p><pre><code>  let
    a = f(x)
    b = g(y)
  in
   a + b
</code></pre>
If there is working memory used in the body of f(), it will be garbage when f() has finished executing, because it won&#x27;t be referred to any more.
So it could be freed after f is executed and before g is executed, which may reduce the maximum amount of memory required by the program.",1438858264

E.g., allow for the thing under each pixel to have moved a little from one image to the next, look at all their narrowband images (which will typically be strongly correlated, especially for nearby wavelengths) to estimate how fast each part of the image is moving, and then to get a pixel in the final image combine its G with slightly offset (maybe interpolated) R and B.<p>Fiddly but hardly, er, rocket science.<p>(Of course for some purposes you really need the unaltered R,G,B images. But if you&#x27;re producing a single RGB JPEG image for public consumption, that&#x27;s not one of those purposes.)<p>[EDITED to add:] More difficult, I guess, is dealing with things that appear in only some of the planes. E.g., if G is taken last then there will be bits of Earth at the trailing edge of the moon in the G frame that have no counterparts in the R,B frames because the moon occluded them in those frames. So there will still be artefacts in the image. But I&#x27;d have thought they&#x27;d be less objectionable than the ones you get from just naively stacking the R, G, and B.",1438858101

Because the moon has moved in relation to the Earth between the time the first (red) and last (green) exposures were made, a thin green offset appears on the right side of the moon when the three exposures are combined.

Of course they have missed some test case, but how do you make sure your quality assurance does not miss something as well?<p>I believe it is cheaper and faster to understand the code, side effects and interactions than to rely only on testing (which is immensely important of course).<p>In order to grow as a developer one has to understand there is no magic - you need to strive for understanding.",1438856624

I think it may have been some institutional committee type effect because it seems to dumb for a smart individual to do. It didn&#x27;t really effect me because I just skipped 8 but three of my friends / family who don&#x27;t follow tech bought a new computer unaware of what Microsoft had done and were shocked / horrified to find things didn&#x27;t work as before. My cousin figured it took him about 100 hours to get some stuff working again and the other two basically stopped using their computers. It was particually painful with my dad whos 80ish and slowing down a bit but who could use 7 but who was unable to work 8. I have lasting resentment to Microsoft over that - the amount of pain and inconvenience they caused their regular users. And for what? I think the brilliant reasoning was if they force people to use a phone interface on their computers they&#x27;ll be used to that interface and buy windows phones and tablets. That worked out well for them with the recent $7.6 bn write off on Nokia and presumably lots of well meaning employees losing their jobs. At least the new management seem to have returned to trying to treat their customers well rather than inflicting unpopular stuff in a misguided attempt to get more money.",1438856608

You can re-write something that does what you want it to to be easy to understand, you can rewrite something that&#x27;s easy to understand into something with good performance. And you&#x27;ll generally learn something at each step of that chain which makes the next step easier, (or possible.)<p>- If working on the code, (not just trying to get a map of it in my head,) I only have one function open on my screen at a time. By that I mean that everything else will be collapsed or in a different buffer; somehow I won&#x27;t even be looking at it. This does not, of itself, make you any faster – at least not that I&#x27;m aware of, it may lower some mental load that I haven&#x27;t considered. However, if your code is so entangled that you can&#x27;t write without having several functions open on your screen at the same time, then that&#x27;s a very strong sign that that there&#x27;s a poor abstraction at work. In which case it&#x27;s often better to burn it to the ground and write a new one. Which brings us to:<p>- Burn it to the ground and start over. Specifically with respect to hunting bugs: Before diving into a function someone wrote, or that I wrote some time ago, to hunt a bug, I&#x27;ll try to write a new function that does what that function reports itself to do, (or method if I&#x27;m using OOP.) Often, it&#x27;s a lot faster to write something that doesn&#x27;t have that error to begin with than it is to work out precisely what went wrong the first time around.<p>- Naming. Good naming is hard, and the decision as to what to name is non-trivial. It may seem obvious to you that a bit of code gives you something but it&#x27;s not necessarily so to others. For this reason alone, though I don&#x27;t like pair programming, I make time every couple of weeks to do it. It gives me some idea of what&#x27;s non-obvious, both to me and to them. “What&#x27;s this?” Having the right things named makes your code much cleaner and easier to manipulate.<p>- If the function doesn&#x27;t fit on one reasonably sized monitor, in other words if it&#x27;s longer than a couple of hundred lines, then chances are either I&#x27;m writing it wrong or I&#x27;ve made some sort of design mistake; the function is too general, or tries to do too many things. This is not a strict rule as the other, and obviously varies to some degree by the syntax of the language one uses. A relatively dense language like Lisp I&#x27;d say if it&#x27;s longer than 40 lines.<p>- Don&#x27;t use a new library in production code unless you have good reason to. There are far too many people who want to play with the latest cool toy just because it is the latest cool toy. Do that on your own time.<p>Work method:<p>- I don&#x27;t have a to-do list, I have a calendar. This helps with managing interruptions and prioritising things. IME it&#x27;s easy for people&#x27;s to-do lists to grow far too large, without them paying any mind to when they&#x27;re going to do things and the little inefficiencies involved in changing to each task. Someone comes up and wants something done I can look at the calendar and know what can be moved and when something can be slotted in.<p>- If I can help it, and this means unless someone <i>very</i> senior in the company tells me otherwise, I don&#x27;t book periods of time shorter than an hour for a task. If there are a lots of little tasks that are related then I group them and book an hour. If there&#x27;s only one little task, it&#x27;s still an hour. Preferably, however, these are things that get pushed later in the week when they can be grouped.<p>- I don&#x27;t have automatically checked email and I don&#x27;t have any work-known email accounts on any non-work computers. I check my email at the start of the day and the end of the day, and that&#x27;s it. Email is an enormous time sink.<p>- I have a separate work phone and home phone, and the work phone is turned off and lives in a locked draw in my office when I&#x27;m not at work.<p>- Strictly police your free time. If someone asks you whether you can just do this thing for them, or whether you can stay on that night to get something banged out… well, there are times to say yes, but most of the time the answer should be no. You probably need your down time. This also makes people take your time more seriously and lets them know that if you are staying on it <i>is</i> a favour.<p>- I only take holiday in week long chunks of greater. Contiguous time off is, IME, dramatically more rejuvenating than a day here and a day there.<p>- Have hobbies. All my best ideas have come from hobbies. Be that reading fiction and thinking &#x27;I can make a shadow of that.&#x27; Or seeing cool art examples. Or meeting someone at a club who tells me about a problem they have. You might think that this is going to be a point about knowing what people want. It&#x27;s not, although that can happen. It&#x27;s a point about knowing how different people think about the problems which lets you generate more fitting abstractions.",1438856427

Windows PCs were difficult to get running properly, and Linux while generally OK often had smallish bugs unless you were using LTS releases which quickly became outdated.<p>* Our designers used Photoshop and other Adobe products and helped out with front-end dev so they were stuck on Mac full-stop if they wanted one machine.<p>* We had an Apple store 5 minutes walk from our office, so hardware support was immediately available if required.<p>* Standardised hardware on the Mac platform meant standardised connectivity: everyone had a Mac charger at their desk, mini-DP screens, AppleTVs in the meeting rooms to stream your desktop to etc.<p>* Clients that were buying design services felt like they were getting their money’s worth if they walked into a room full of people with beards and Macs (I know you’ll hate that point, but that doesn’t make it less true).<p>* The PCs we had in the office on average had more hardware problems and needed to be replaced more often than the Macs.<p>People weren’t forced onto Mac hardware (we had Linux users too) but objectively it generally made more sense for my company for the reasons above.",1438855455

If you get CAC below 3,25 ARPU then you have infinite marketing budget and that can indeed go geometric. But that&#x27;s a big if, and even then at some point your marketing channels will dry up at some scale, while churn remains the same at scale as businesses keep dying or changing their mind.",1438855247

They may say so, but action say a bit different story - how can they be good friends with places like Saudi Arabia and worse? what they care about is, are you with us or against? any other position is very hard to maintain, albeit possible. you just need a bit extra finance for that.<p>freedom and good life for vietnamese people was not considered much when that war was planned (beginning by staged US Tonkin gulf accident to get a foot in situation, in good ol&#x27; Gleiwitz nazi style). it was all about influence, having foothold out there so soviets don&#x27;t take it all around, keeping armed forces trained in real life scenarios (train your forces in small war to be prepared for big one) etc. US was very much anything but a good guy there. Saying North vietnamese did worse things doesn&#x27;t make you automatically a good guy, does it.<p>Nah, Vietnam is just another topic in US history americans should feel ashamed of. Quite a few I met that are not teenagers actually do. And look at result - they lost the war, they screwed up that country really bad (ie many birth defects many years after the war thanx to Agent Orange spraying), and at the end, country found its way to +-democracy in peaceful way, although it took some serious time. But you can&#x27;t make that much money from selling arms in peace, can you",1438855200

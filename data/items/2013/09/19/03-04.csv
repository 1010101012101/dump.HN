6409649,comment,6406832,6406832,9,0,ianb,,,"Coincidentally I just came upon the term &quot;Concerted Cultivation&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerted_cultivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerted_cultivation</a>) which describes the modern middle class typical parenting, the very thing that leaves kids with little time to play.  Working back from that you get to the book <i>Unequal Childhoods</i> which contrasts middle class and working class parenting (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_Childhoods#Parenting_Styles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_Childhoods#Parenting_St...</a>).  I find the contrast interesting:<p>&quot;<i>Concerted Cultivation</i>: The parenting style, favored by middle-class families, in which parents encourage negotiation and discussion and the questioning of authority, and enroll their children in extensive organized activity participation. This style helps children in middle-class careers, teaches them to question people in authority, develops a large vocabulary, and makes them comfortable in discussions with people of authority. However, it gives the children a sense of entitlement.<p>&quot;<i>Achievement of Natural Growth</i>: The parenting style, favored by working-class and lower-class families, in which parents issue directives to their children rather than negotiations, encourage the following and trusting of people in authority positions, and do not structure their children&#x27;s daily activities, but rather let the children play on their own. This method has benefits that prepare the children for a job in the &quot;working&quot; or &quot;poor-class&quot; jobs, teaches the children to respect and take the advice of people in authority, and allows the children to become independent at a younger age.&quot;<p>----<p>When contrasted against Achievement of Natural Growth it&#x27;s not so surprising that parents have decided to take another path.  Simple romanticism about the past isn&#x27;t really that helpful.  Just kick the kid out of the house and let them play?  People talk about the lack of peers that aren&#x27;t similarly scheduled up, but I see kids all the time who are left free... and I&#x27;m not comfortable with how those kids are developing in that environment.  Not that they aren&#x27;t fine playmates, but it&#x27;s not a kind of parenting I would want to imitate.  And a lot of the efforts pushing for more structured time (more afterschool activities, full day kindergarten, universal preschool) are directed towards those kids that need it.  But of course we all get washed up in it, even if increased structure is only needed by a segment of the population.<p>There are other models.  Consider for instance <i>Tools Of The Mind</i> (<a href=""http://www.toolsofthemind.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toolsofthemind.org/</a>), a preschool program that has shown surprising success.  It incorporates a lot of pretend play, but adds structure to that pretend play.  But it&#x27;s not authoritarian structure.  Adults are really important to children, we have a lot to offer.  We can enhance play, get kids out of ruts, enhance the environment, help kids match up their desires with productive paths of learning.  Which also means giving them independence at the right time.  And sometimes at the wrong time.  And sometimes kids need to be understimulated.  But it&#x27;s not that simple.<p>From the article: &quot;You cant teach creativity; all you can do is let it blossom. Little children, before they start school, are naturally creative.&quot;  I don&#x27;t buy that.  <i>Teaching</i> creativity might be going a bit far, but it can absolutely be nurtured and inspired.  Children, when just left alone, DO NOT DO WELL.  I know just interjecting myself in a kids play for 30 seconds, at the right time, can considerably improve the creativity of their play.  My nephew has been pretty into playing with blocks lately, but kind of repeating himself.  I started making a bridge with a ramp, and he&#x27;s been obsessed with those forms for the last few days, trying new configurations, larger structures, bridges across corners, all sorts of stuff.  Real creativity, he&#x27;s not just copying what I did.  But he needed a little inspiration.<p>Do you just let kids work out all their problems between each other on their own?  Sometimes kids work things out well.  Sometimes they fight, often they bully, sometimes they are deliberately cruel, or depressingly meek.  Setting up a bunch of rules is a bad solution too.  Never hit!  Now you can&#x27;t play fight with paper towel rolls.  And you can&#x27;t learn how to interact physically without hurting each other.  Always share!  Or: always ask before taking!  Or: turns!  But sometimes one kid <i>really</i> wants something, and the other kid just happens to be holding that thing.  Or sometimes a kid is just immitating, they ignored the toy until they saw someone else enjoying it.  But the negotiated response is more sophisticated than any rule.  Ask, trade, offer, come up with a creative way to both play with the toy.  Acknowledge that not all kids communicate well with language, but body language is often more than enough to work on.  But this doesn&#x27;t happen on its own.  As the kids get older, they don&#x27;t communicate constructively on their own, or resolve their own conflicts, <i>but they can do those things</i>.  They need help.  Not rules, not structures to define their interactions, but they need engaged adults (or older children).<p>I don&#x27;t really disagree with this article.  But it&#x27;s a critique that lacks empathy with the parental decisions that got us to where we are, and it does not respond to the concerns those parents have had.  I think there&#x27;s a way to achieve both, parenting isn&#x27;t a choice somewhere on the line between two extremes, there&#x27;s no limit to the number of novel and engaged choices available to us.",1379562193

I can&#x27;t blame him though, it&#x27;s not on the client to understand, it&#x27;s on the service provider to educate as needed. The client did nothing wrong in this case, but that he thought these things were positive is what shows his lack of understanding. To me, these things show a lack of experience and professionalism on the part of the provider.<p>> The platform is built on Ruby on Rails running on MySQL and the fantastic Elastic Beanstalk from Amazon Web Services. Not too complex, but enough to challenge the average freelancer.<p>So, here he assumes that freelancer is on the low end of the scale of technical ability? Perhaps this is true for the freelancers he has picked up. If your freelance developer is challenged by a Rails projects which is &quot;not too complex&quot; then perhaps you should keep looking. A freelancer should be an expert at the services provided. Hourly rate in this case is often irrelevant, see also &quot;10x&quot; developer.<p>> Late nights spent debugging issues, 30 minute response times day or night, challenging questions about some of our design or dev decisions, a constant awareness of us being in startup mode with suggestions on affordable options to deploy various bits of tech and then two unforgettable incidents.<p>This isn&#x27;t a freelancer, this is an employee. But it&#x27;s not really an employee either, because this person doesn&#x27;t get any of the perks of being an employee. Not that it really matters, I think those perks are largely imaginary anyways. Nobody really has job security.<p>A good freelancer has other clients and a life. Work which encroaches on that life (and elevates priority over my other client work) had better make it worth my while in terms of payments. Clearly, from the rest of this article, this isn&#x27;t something the author is thinking about. For me, the squeaky wheel doesn&#x27;t get the grease. The money wheel gets the grease and the squeaky wheel gets dropped.<p>> The first time I knew this was going to be a great relationship was when &#x27;N&#x27; dialed in for our usual Monday evening call and started the conversation with &quot;I was thinking over the weekend that a good way to optimise the user experience would be xx which would positively impact YY in the business&quot;.<p>See the above items about other clients and a life.<p>> &#x27;N&#x27; said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking that the right thing to do here is give you 50% off my last bill (around $700 USD discount) given the situation. I value our relationship and I&#x27;m choosing the right thing vs the right business decision. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll work together again and believe in what GetViable is trying to do.&quot;<p>As a client, this would be a red flag. This would be the sort of thing which would make me do a face-palm. What would Steve Jobs do? ;)<p>Here are some bullet points to help supplement my above points.<p>- I&#x27;m not a freelancer, I&#x27;m a business providing a service.<p>- As a business owner, my job is to maximize the money coming into the door. I don&#x27;t give discounts and I seek the maximum rates I feel the market can bear. If I left money on the table, I screwed up.<p>- If I don&#x27;t own part of your business, then I&#x27;m not your partner. Reaching your expectations that we both laid out is important, beyond that, the success of your business is none of my concern. I do wish you the best of luck though.<p>- Don&#x27;t judge me on my willingness to slave myself to your business. Judge me on the strength of my own business. If I&#x27;m successful, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m more effective than my competition. Jones and Brothers plumbing service which has been in business 40 years has been in business that long because it&#x27;s run well. Joe Blow freelancer who has been in business for a year and is making the above business mistakes probably won&#x27;t be around for long. Or eventually will learn from those mistakes.<p>- It&#x27;s important to understand that my business model is different from yours. If I&#x27;m a solo developer then the money I can bring in the door for my development services is limited by the number of hours that I can work in one day. I can&#x27;t scale beyond those hours. I can hire another developer, but that developer is bound by the same constraints. I have to maximize every hour that I&#x27;m working. Your business model is different. It can scale beyond the available working hours in your day. Don&#x27;t expect me to discount my rates at the detriment of my business so that you can more easily bootstrap yours.<p>- You need to be paying your freelancers well. Money is the lifeblood of any business, even if a freelancer is acting more like a sort of plug-in employee rather than a business owner. If that lifeblood isn&#x27;t flowing well, then the business is going to run into problems and ultimately that&#x27;s going to affect your project.",1379561901

That creates an opportunity for a disruptive movement that shifts the market instead of pandering to it. My guess would be that private clouds, software-defined networking and a bunch of tools that better support things like remote working and BYOD will steadily push full external cloud solutions out of most large corporations, and smaller scale tools based on the same basic ideas will emerge to support SMEs.<p>And that brings me to my big question: What is the only operating system in the world that is already demonstrably a credible platform for all of server, desktop and mobile computing?",1379560682

If you showed the logo to someone, would they be able to think of a word that coincides with a goal/mission of your company? Why is it looking down? If you&#x27;re looking to predict (keywords: future, time, ready, etc.) then why not make it look forward?<p>These are the types of questions that struck me first looking at the logo. It feels like there was more focus on how it looked than to what it represents.

What does it want to do? Why does it exist? Like a person, you want to get to know it before you can label it. Once you have the part of what you want to symbolize, what you want to communicate, you can start sketching. Start trying to really capture the soul of the company and present it in an aesthetic and still functional way.<p>Having aesthetics without much focus on function, that&#x27;s what I feel the author is categorizing Dribble designers as.<p>Having functionality without aesthetic, well, we&#x27;ll use an automobile for that example.

IBM Systems Journal wasn&#x27;t always behind some shitty IEEE paywall.<p>Yet sadder still, the price to subscribe to IBM Systems Journal through IEEE?  $1,400 USD for a one year sub.<p>Frack... I now remember why I&#x27;m sometimes ashamed to admit to being a member of IEEE.  Guess it&#x27;s time to get move involved in the elections and leadership stuff... <i>sigh</i>",1379559828

So when you reply to a thread using sage as a downvote, you encourage the poster by giving him replies. Using sage is just a flag to the other guy that his post is irritating enough for you to sage it.<p>This used to be a huge problem when it was popular to post troll pony threads on macho boards like /v/, /sp/, or /fit/. What would happen is there would be 10 replies in the first minute, all sages, calling the OP a retard and reminding everyone to sage and report the thread. These replies would just feed him, to which he would reply to the sages and egg people on even more - to which he would receive even more replies.<p>The only acceptable analogue to &quot;downvoting&quot; on 4chan is to not reply to the thread. Nothing can dissuade a shitposter more than having put some effort into writing a good baity OP post, and not getting a single reply before the janitors delete it.",1379559790

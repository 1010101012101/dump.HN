For example, writing a non-speed-critical program (which is most of them) in C or C++. A few years ago you could justify that because the other languages didn't have such extensive libraries, but today it's ludicrous.""<p>I think this is the text that was intended to be cited.<p>Thanks to the GP for posting that article, it's well worth reading for any and all of Bram Cohen's insights.",1219539456

PG said somewhere that Viaweb spent about $2m in its entire existance. All that's changed is that the tools have improved and dedicated web hosting with decent bandwidth costs are in the hundreds instead of the thousands of dollars. It's always been possible to start a web business off a credit card or a digging into a modest nest egg - the only difference is, back then, most people saw little reason to when someone would gladly give them $5-10 million bucks (which needed to be spent) to get the site off the ground.<p>Of course, this isn't new to anyone reading this, so please excuse my audienceless rant. :)\n",1174967991

Facebook is built in PHP, C++, Perl, Python, Java, and even a little bit of MLÂand it all works together.<p>    - We are the largest user in the world of memcached, an open-source caching system. Originally developed by LiveJournal, we've since made so many scalability improvements and performance upgrades that we will be the primary contributor of features in the next major release.<p>    - We've created a custom-built search engine serving millions of queries a day, completely distributed and entirely in-memory, with real-time updates.<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/jobs_engineering.php"">http://www.facebook.com/jobs_engineering.php</a>\n",1174967245

6521,comment,6505,6505,0,0,python_kiss,,,"I think TechStars made three mistakes:<p>1. Low publicity.<p>2. Asked too many questions (i.e. what does it mean to be an entrepreneur?)<p>3. Deadline too soon.<p>They should've kept the deadline for applications at April 12th since by that time, all YC applicants will know if they have been accepted/rejected. The rejected ones could then apply at TechStars. This is not necessarily a bad thing since YC only picks 15 teams, while leaving a big pool of other great startup ideas and founders behind.<p>I have had phone conversations with numerous entrepreneurs on news.yc, and almost all of them plan on applying to TechStars while keeping YC as their first option. <p>TechStars could have, for marketing purposes, used aikido strategy and turn Y-Combinator's strength into weakness: since TechStars is new, they could've claimed that they place greater focus on the startups they fund as a way to prove their model superior to YC. A lot of people would've bought into that argument.<p>Having competition actually validates Y-Combinator's business model. While two similar programs may not be good for either parties, it is definitely good for the prospective founders.\n",1174966264

If you're only hiring your friends or people you recruit from school or your online contacts, I think it's a lot less well-defined.<p>Better question -- is he planning to hand the company over to an undergrad when he turns 30?",1174966208
6519,comment,6216,6216,0,0,fireandfury,,,"The definition of technology that I use is: a way to organize or process information. <p>So is Facebook a technology? Yes, I think so. It's a useful tool for promoting events and for keeping track of friends (contacts, what they are up to). <p>I agree that it isn't the most challenging or complex type of technology, but I've found some of the features (on Facebook) to be quite useful and entertaining.\n",1174966154
6518,comment,6505,6505,0,0,rms,,,"Techstars is a clear second to Y Combinator. But there's nothing wrong it. They have a solid program lined up. Yes, the application is completely plagiarized. PG, did they ask permission or did they just do it?<p>Regardless, the YC application is pretty much perfect for this type of program, so I can understand that they didn't want to mess with something that worked. Plagiarism is a high form of flattery. The three or four changed or new questions make the TS application worse than the YC one, they shouldn't have bothered.<p>A venture capitalist is one of the founders of TS -- PG sees that as a negative but it could make it easier to get money from a friendly venture capitalist or provide insight into the notoriously obtuse mind of a VC.<p>TS also has more than one session a week. I see that additional structure as a good thing but I'm sure PG would argue that it's taking time away from hacking.<p>\nThe website of each company certainly shows a difference in mentality -- YC is stylized minimalism, TS is over the top web design you get when you pay someone too much to design you a site.<p><p>So what should you do? Apply to both. Don't sell yourself short. Boulder's a nice city. So is Boston (even though the trains don't run past midnight).",1174966020

If you aren't intellectually curious enough to read through all the books and blogs written on these subjects on your own, then you're probably the kind of person who should be working for someone else.

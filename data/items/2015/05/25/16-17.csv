I think of &#x27;balance&#x27; in multiplayer games as a different thing altogether.  I am usually thinking of the match itself, rather than the design of the game.  In that sense, a game is &quot;balanced&quot; if the overall skill level on each side is reasonably close to the overall skill level on the opposing side.  Games where one team is just too much better than the other are boring.  &quot;Balanced&quot; games -- where you really don&#x27;t know who will win until the game is over -- are usually the most fun.",1432573171

9600754,comment,9598333,9600462,0,0,joesmo,,,"I really do not understand why artists sell their work to record labels anymore. Back in the days, they would in theory get some marketing and promotion out of it in addition to the all-important distribution. Now that distribution is practically free and the most successful artists promote themselves (through touring and other means) what is the point of working with record labels? Being a musician myself, it is perplexing to me.<p>Without the record label, the artist can negotiate way better deals and doesn&#x27;t have to pay over 90% to record labels that just don&#x27;t care about them. Does Spotify not negotiate with individual artists? I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised and that would explain a lot of this. Still, there are many other ways of distribution and promotion that artists could seek out with the 90%+ of the earnings they&#x27;re no longer giving up.<p>As far as I can tell, it no longer matters to most artists&#x27; financial standing if listeners are obtaining their music legally or by piracy since the bottom line is essentially the same (asymptotical to zero) for all but the most successful musicians.",1432573126

9600742,comment,9599722,9600596,0,0,Tyr42,,,"There are two ways of being polymorphic over traits in Rust, using static dispatch or boxed traits.<p>Static Dispatch is very analogous to C++ templates (with the as of yet not included in the standard &quot;Concepts&quot; as Traits), so you get a copy of the function specialized for each type.  (We get nicer error messages than templates in C++ because we require you to declare up front what methods you are expecting the type to have at function definition time instead of checking at specialization time that everything is defined.)  There is no runtime cost to using a statically dispatched trait over a hand specialized version of the function.<p>The other method, boxed traits, is very similar to vtables.  It has some runtime overhead, since the size of the time is not known, you must have a pointer to it (hence &quot;boxed&quot;).  I think Rust currently uses fat pointers for this, that is a pair of pointers, one to the object, and the other to the vtable, since you can add new instances to types in other crates, so it&#x27;d be tricky to have a complete vtable for all methods of all the traits the type implements in one place.",1432572912

The fact that you believe my comment reduces to that claim means that you did not understand my comment. That may be my fault in making it unclear or your fault in not trying to read and understand what I was actually saying (instead of simply seeing what you <i>thought</i> I meant), but either way you&#x27;re replying to something I didn&#x27;t say.<p>My comment was in response to someone who felt mentioning essentially that why are we even mad at Snowden, it&#x27;s not like anything <i>bad</i> happened. You seem to agree with me that his actions <i>did</i> result in real negative consequences, so in that regard you agree with me about the only substantive thing I mentioned in my own reply.<p>But to address what you brought up, let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s true that Snowden revealed government wrongdoing. I happen to be of the opinion that merely revealing government wrongdoing doesn&#x27;t excuse <i>every other possible</i> wrong that may have been committed by a &#x27;whistleblower&#x27;. Especially in cases like Snowden&#x27;s where any &quot;whistleblowing&quot; portion of his leaks is dwarfed in magnitude by leaks that don&#x27;t indicate any government wrongdoing at all, but still result in disastrous effects that you admit occurred as a result of his actions.<p>Otherwise a spy would be able to leak whatever they wished by simply throwing a scrap to the media while they tunnel the <i>real</i> secrets to their political masters. And at this point we still can&#x27;t prove Snowden did something like this: The secrets he revealed to the world via the media were all (but one) stolen while he worked at Dell, but before leaving the NSA he deliberately took a position at Booz-Allen Hamilton in order to take higher-level (&quot;Tier 3&quot;) secrets. That Tier 3 was the source of the &quot;NSA spying on these specific Chinese IPs&quot; story soon after Snowden landed in Hong Kong, but those Tier 3 secrets have been revealed to <i>no</i> other journalists (or even angry Internet bloggers...).<p>Why did Snowden need Tier 3 secrets if he wasn&#x27;t going to give them to journalists? Who did he give them to, if not journalists?",1432572881

9600540,comment,9600106,9600467,0,0,timtadh,,,"With Nix it seems like the technology is there. It works. It has a superior model compared with other systems. However, it lacks a corporate sponsor or large community to make it &quot;professional-grade&quot;. Canonical and RedHat make their money from people depending on their packages being continuously up to date. Debian has an enormous community ensuring that stable is stable and secure for the duration of its life. Nix doesn&#x27;t have either, so it is up to the users it does have to be reactive.<p>That said, I think the benefits of Nix are real. The existing configuration management systems do not have the ability to fully understand the system. Nix does, because everything about the system is contained in the configuration file. As a consequence, you can up and down grade servers without fear of breaking everything. You can check to see exactly what changes between different versions. There is much more control and more assurance that the nodes are in the proper state.<p>One part of your comment which I do not understand is:<p>> When you can stand up a fresh VM using Ansible in a few minutes, the value of being able to roll a server back easily is hard to justify.<p>Isn&#x27;t this also true for Nix? You just launch the image and push your desired configuration? If you mean time to write a new ansible playbook/role then in my experience, although I am fairly productive with ansible, I would not put it at &quot;a few minutes&quot; from nothing to a new service. Maybe you are talking about the learning curve? Nix definitely seems steeper so a clear win for ansible on that front.",1432570187

The IDE literally destroys the possibility of making trivial mistakes like this in a non-compiled language.<p>Of course this depends on the ide. I use pycharm which not only checks for mistakes like these, but it highlights and automatically formats code to fit within PEP guidelines. The whole IDE actually attempts to fit your programming universe within the app, including debugging, and even connecting to a database.<p>It does come at a cost, however.

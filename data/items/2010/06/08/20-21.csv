Finding VC money isn't necessarily the way to go.  In fact, it's rarely the way to go unless Stress is something you just can't do without.<p>The fact that someone else (SquareUp) has beaten you to market is irrelevant.  Square isn't out of the woods yet.... Visa, for example will have something to say about it.   Their reader is also not unique, and iPhones will all have the capacity to read cards, without external gadgets.<p>IMHO, you should go after an ""alliance"" with someone in the financial transaction business.  It's not an easy game to play in, as one your posters has pointed out.  I'm not in that business but can help you find someone on that front.

1415207,comment,1414979,1414979,0,0,arthur_debert,,,"The problem is that today, getting started often means: correct syntax highlighting, indentation, auto-complete (intelisense), build integration and scm integration. And  for a few languages at least(e.g javascript, python, ruby, html, css, xml, shell scripts).<p>This is the problem. Going through the emacs tutorial is not enough. It's not that people have trouble getting started, they just don't want to experience the sudden drop in productivity once those things go away (at least for a while until you learn how to do them).<p>I've switched to emacs lately, and it was worth it. But it's hard to justify, to a newcomer,  why the default javascript mode sucks with common idioms (no indentation, tags - and let's not even get started on intelisense).<p>When emacs and vi were kings, very few environments where that capable. So all you had to learn was basic editing. Everything else was a surplus. In the last few years, with the rise of eclipse, visual studio, netbeans and others, it's a harder battle.<p>In my dream world the emacs community would do a gentle fork, that would have ide like capabilities for common setups (python, js, ruby, c, perl, html, java, etc) + editing as expected (like hungry-delete) + more common key bindings (like the command key as meta on mac). Bonus point for a s/frame/window/ , s/buffer/file/ and so on on the documentation.<p>This way, newbies would be almost at home from the start (some commands to learn, plus the odd keybindings). But with time, they would customize more, and learn to drop the training wheels if necessary. The problem is learning everything at once (terminology, key bindings, elisp, editing) is too much burden for most folks.",1276030591

It's a sellers market for talent. The prospective employer should be the one going to extreme lengths to hire people.<p>Some people aren't looking for yet-another-job. They have a laser focus on one or two companies that they want to work for --- and not only that, but they know exactly what role they want in those companies. They (gasp) aren't even necessarily looking at the job reqs. They're walking up to 37s and saying ""I could really kick ass helping you with your interfaces, here's why, let's get talking.""<p>So, two things:<p>(1) Fried is saying, you want to run your company in such a way that you're getting exposed to those kinds of people. Which means, you're running a very tight ship with a small number of people so that any ANY hire is going to end up having a dramatic role in the company. You can't be Google and expect people to build mini-sites to get an interchangeable-product dev role.<p>(2) As a potential employee, you want to consider whether you want to spend your career bouncing from job-req job to job-req job. This isn't touchy-feely startup-y 37signals-y talk here; the <i>entire book</i> ""What Color Is Your Parachute"" has ""get jobs this way"" as its theme.

I believe nothing of the kind. My claim is that other things being equal, women statistically make more rational risk assessments than men. Of course people in finance should have training and skill. If Wall St. were more committed to better risk management and the profitability that results, then perhaps it would do more to ensure that more women had the necessary training and skill sets; I understand that multi million dollar salaries are quite effective at motivating people.<p><i>To prove that hiring women would increase profits, you need to show that female traders would make more profits than male traders, not show that they are more rational.</i><p>We don't live in a world where there are lots of women in the upper echelons of the finance industry for comparison, so I can't show that. However, I can show you that all other things being equal, stock investors that are male exhibit overconfidence and trade more frequently than female investors. The net result is that female investors outperform male investors. As in, generate more profits.

Overconfident people tend to make incorrect evaluations: their confidence makes them ignore discrepancies that should be investigated. It also makes them shut out dissenting voices warning of future problems. Your question seems akin to asking ""why do you believe the Challenger explosion was caused by a crappy design rather than the failure of an o-ring seal?"".",1276029584

I agree with you that reagents can be a huge amount of the cost.<p>Part of this depends on the quantity of reactions you're doing. Taking the DNA barcoding of trees example we gave, if you're doing hundreds of reactions the cost can already be quite low as crocowhile pointed out. If you're just learning or doing a few reactions, here's where a kit containing small quantities of the needed reagents and educational information can be more cost effective.<p>The other part has to do with the exact reagents you need. Obviously if you can use an off the shelf master mix you'll pay much less than if you need to purchase a specialized enzyme and specific reaction buffer. There are cases where that is needed, but there's also cases where people purchase reagents more expensive than what they need, simply because they just want their reaction to work, they've found one way to make it work, and they'd rather spend more time on their project rather than finding the more cost effective ways to make it work.<p>Here there's a lot of opportunity for software or software coupled with hardware to find the most cost effective way to do a reaction and make it work better. For example, a PCR machine networked with a UV spec and some software could quantify template DNA, present recommendations on enzymes, calculate the best reaction parameters accurately, and tell the user exactly what quantities to add of primers/enzyme/buffer/water. Many users of PCR are not necessarily experts at PCR, so there's some opportunity to help people get better results while saving time and money.<p>We're thinking about these larger problems, but focusing on getting an accurate and reliable PCR machine working first. Once we have that, we'll have the foundation to pursue these other areas.",1276029029

In fact, I doubt that any standardized test can make that distinction - I suspect that they top out around the 99%ile (actually, an 800/800 on the GRE math was only about 96%ile when I took it).<p>When a test is tedious, irritating, and consists primarily of solving simple geometry and algebra problems and choosing answers from a multiple choice menu, and when the difference between 99.9%ile and 98.7%ile is a couple of missed answers, I suspect you're measuring noise.n  I'm not saying the tests are useless, they're probably pretty good.  But to identify why the few great mathematical minds come from one group or another?  Seriously?<p>The only real way to measure this kind of talent is to provide opportunities to learn, step back, wait 20 years, and see what they've done.<p>As for the gender question, well I guess I'm just begging the question with my ""opportunity to learn"" statement, because the whole question is whether this imbalance is in itself strong evidence of differing opportunities for men and women.<p>How do you measure something that is obscure and present in only a miniscule fraction of the population?

The former helps one to do the latter, but it is not by any means the only important component. Technical skill, time and effort also matter. A rational trader, without much skill, might correctly assess her strategy as having a 50% chance of success. An overconfident trader, with a great deal of skill, might assess his strategy as having a 90% chance of success when it actually has only a 70% chance of success. The skilled irrational trader will still make more money.<p>To prove that hiring women would increase profits, you need to show that female traders would make more profits than male traders, not show that they are more rational.<p>As for a PhD, most trading these days is quantitative. The era of frat boys throwing darts at a stock chart is over. Most trading strategies are designed by quants (i.e., the PhDs, sometimes ABDs, occasionally a masters in math finance), implemented by programmers (usually also having a heavy quant background), and occasionally executed by compulsive gamblers who go nuts over numbers.

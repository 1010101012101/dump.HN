676930,comment,676844,676844,0,0,cturner,,,"Writing a shell on a java application platform with the principle that ""everything is a filesystem"". Shell is really mininal - just enough to browse the application, launch an editor and trigger simple programs in jvm languages like js, objective-j, jython, ioke and whatever else they like.<p>Achievements so far? I now have the beginnings of a shell, filesystem API (that was pretty simple), and a jython implementation of ed with basic functionality but some bugs. :)",1246118324

676928,comment,676056,676847,0,0,daveungerer,,,"Fine, I'll mark statements by Dr. McDougall with [D], WikiPedia with [W].  A few brief examples:<p>[D]: Worldwide, populations of hundreds of millions of people who eat high GI potatoes (Peruvians) and rice (Asians) are trim and active for a lifetime.\n[W]: The high consumption of legumes in South America and fresh fruit and vegetables in Asia likely lowers the glycemic effect in these individuals. The mixing of high and low GI carbohydrates produces moderate GI values.<p>[D]: the American Diabetic Association dismisses the value of GI in treating diabetes.\n[W]: The glycemic index is supported by leading international health organisations including the American Diabetes Association.<p>If you read Dr. McDougall's material carefully, you'll see him stringing together sets of unrelated facts and strawmen in such a way that it almost appears that a valid argument is being made.  Like this gem:\n[D]: ""For the most efficient means of replenishing spent glycogen reserves, athletes have learned to choose foods that have a high GI.  Selecting foods with a high GI is just as sound advice for anyone yearning to be strong and energetic throughout the day—not just for athletes.""<p>The second statement does not follow from the first.  Doing what athletes do to replenish their reserves when you haven't even used yours is incredibly bad advice.  I'm speechless.",1246118160

Greens provide little calories, and you claim berries only once or twice a year, so basically you are saying 95%+ of their calories were from meat.  A bold assertion - any references?",1246117795

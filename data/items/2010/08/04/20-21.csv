Math and art have been strongly intertwined for a very long time, from the Golden Ratio of the Greeks to Da Vinci to Escher (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_and_art"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_and_art</a>).  Those who are good at math are frequently good at art partly because they can understand abstractions and separate them from 'icons' of objects and ideas.

I love how it syncs your place so you can pick up on the phone. I haven't used the Kindle app much (which does the same) because most of the books I read are old and freely available in epub or PDF. I also use, to a lesser degree, Instapaper and Reeder. I used to use Stanza but the lack of sync is a deal breaker. Sad really because it's such a nice app.<p>-Playing Music. I use it as a banjo tuner with OmniTuner (an iPhone app) and I also use TabToolkit and GuitarTookit as well as PDF's with written music and tab. It's more convenient than lugging around books or loose leaf paper.<p>-Listening to Music. The speakers are good enough to make moving it around from room to room and using it for background music nice.<p>-Occasional Browsing. I really don't like browsing on it and it feels like the only browsing I do on there is wasting time. I get the nagging feeling that I should just be reading a book, or doing something off-screen altogether, rather than browsing. The tabs are clunky, the browser is slim on features and typing is too slow.<p>-Mindmaps, Mockups. I don't think it's the ideal tool (yet) for either of those activities, but I sometimes do both if I don't have the laptop handy. iMockups is pretty nice. I'd put OmniFocus on there if I hadn't already spent so much on it for my Mac and iPhone. I'm not dropping another $40 for it.<p>-Etc., Games, Email, Evernote, Netflix, YouTube. I play Carcassone and Settlers. I use Flashcard apps to try to teach my baby to read. I respond to emails and write notes in Evernote. I'm not a big fan of typing on the iPad (I prefer the iPhone keyboard) so I use it for email less than I expected, but still, it's nice to have it there. I thought I'd use it for video all the time, and the times I do, it's wonderful. I'd guess I watch a movie on it twice or three times a month.<p>Overall, I'm glad I have it, I'd probably miss it a lot if it was gone and, as you can see from the list above, I've integrated it many areas of my life. Strangely though, I don't have a strong emotional attachment to it. I don't get excited to defend it and I don't sell it to friends/family. With the iPhone I couldn't wait to recommend it to everyone I know.",1280954462

We've been talking A LOT with companies re: internships and entry level hiring for CollegeJobConnect because, well, that's what our company does! :)<p>Here are my thoughts:<p>For undergraduates, employers can't key off of past work experiences because many students simply don't have any (I didn't). If you have done an internship, awesome! Highlight that experience and make sure your description of what you did includes a ""so what?"" statement (ex. ""Built a cool new widget in C++ for Acme Co. (so what?) <i>which improved our client service department's ability to handle critical requests and improve response time</i>"" - silly example, but you get the point). All points should explain <i></i>what<i></i> you did and <i></i>why<i></i> it was important to yourself, to your employer, to the world in general, etc.<p>If you've worked on projects or have things you can point to online, highlight those too. Again, make sure you explain the importance of what you did and why the employer you are asking to hire you should be impressed (as in ""Because of my work on Project X I am now a jQuery ninja and can produce incredible UIs"" or ""During Project X we won 2000 users and I learned the importance of client support and cost-effective marketing""). Along those same lines, if you have a blog or social media presence, make sure they all tie in together and tell your story well ... and that they display appropriate content :)<p>Definitely include as many objective metrics as you can: overall GPA, major GPA, SATs, any honors that you received, sports or clubs you participated in, and what your hobbies are.<p>That's what comes to mind off the top of my head, glad to chat a bit more if you'd like, hit me up at jeff at collegejobconnect.com - good luck!",1280954208

I initially bought it somewhat second guessing myself thinking I was buying an over-expensive toy that I would regret, but have changed my mind drastically. Now someone would have to pry it away from me.<p>My laptop used to be tied to me wherever I was in my house, but now it has essentially become a desktop because I have almost no use for it. It is larger, clunkier, gets very hot in my lap, has far shorter battery life, etc. I had a netbook but almost never used it because it was so slow it was unbearable. To jump into a browser and get to GMail was a few minute endeavor which quickly left me so frustrated I'm surprised the thing did not end up out my window.<p>The iPad is fantastic for most of my everyday things such as checking my email, web browsing, etc. It's always on and FAST, so I am never frustrated as I was with my netbook. I no longer have to take my laptop with me on trips as the iPad will suffice in most scenarios. If I'll be gone for awhile, I bring a bluetooth keyboard and have iSSH which I can use to connect to any of my servers on the road. Once I've got an SSH session open, it is not really much different from using a laptop. When I'm on a plane, I can spin up multiple movies back to back and its 10+ hour battery life means that I'll almost never run it out by the time I land. No laptop could compare to that and it is in such a small, convenient package.<p>I still use my ""real"" computers for development, but for almost everything else, I use my iPad. In fact, it is very nice to separate my development from my time-wasting viewing. Now I do nothing but development on my laptop and have my iPad for casual browsing. That separation is very nice.<p>And one of the uses I did not anticipate when I first got it is the photo sharing aspect. Now anytime I am with family or friends and I mention something such as a trip I took, I can pull the iPad out (I take it with me everywhere because it is compact enough...I did not do the same with my laptop) and casually flip through photos, giving them visuals to accompany my stories.<p>My latest ""killer app"" is OmniFocus; their iPad implementation is stellar. It truly has changed my workflow and my ability to keep things prioritized. I previously was using the iPhone version of the app doubled on the iPad and it just wasn't all that great.<p>I would seriously recommend one of these to most family/friends looking to pick up a computer because it would do everything they need and be quite a value. My sister asked for a recommendation on a computer and was looking at some systems that were $1000+. Since all she does essentially is check her email and browse the web, I coaxed her into getting an iPad. She saved a few hundred dollars and has loved the device far more than a laptop. For more developer types, it is less viable as a replacement and more of a lifestyle augment, but it was a purchase I would make again in a second.",1280953480

Any designer worth anything could have told you that the old logo was way better than the new one. The old logo has its problems, but it communicates exactly what it needs to. (And I think it's actually the strongest point of the entire page.) The 99designs logo is such a step back I really have no idea where to start. It communicates <i>absolutely nothing</i>. The image is generic, meaningless, and (in my opinion) ugly. The text is small and (especially in the context of the whole page) very hard to find and read.<p>It's really important to realize that design doesn't mean ""nice looking"" and it doesn't mean ""professional"". Those are the means to an end, not the end itself. Design is about <i>purpose</i>, and the reason the original logo is so much better than the new one is because the old logo makes clear <i>exactly</i> what BCC is and what it's for and the 99designs logo doesn't.<p>It's also really important to realize that you're designing for an audience, and Patrick's audience is teachers. They aren't generally going to care if the logo (or the rest of the site, even) screams 2002. If you're trying to sell to artists and designers you're going to have to put more work into making your logo look nice, but here it's really not what's most important.<p>Design is a lot deeper than aesthetics, and there are a ton of different things that have to go into a logo design. The takeaway from this shouldn't be that engineering trumps design: the 99designs logo is hardly designed at all, and you're not going to find many genuinely good designers at a place like 99designs.",1280953188

'travel.com') will place a snippet of JS or an image from a tracker (eg. 'tracker.com') on its site - anything to initiate a HTTP request.  The HTTP response from 'tracker.com' will set a 'tracker.com' cookie in your browser.  This cookie will contain a unique identifier, which links to a backend database at 'tracker.com', which will now contain the fact that you visited 'travel.com'.  Sometimes 'travel.com' will use JS to add parameters to the HTTP request to 'tracker.com', to pass things like gender or age or location, should they know that about you.  This information is also added to the database at 'tracker.com', keyed to the unique identifier in your cookie.<p>You'll then go to another site, which will make a request for an advertisement.  The request might be directly to 'tracker.com', or it might be to another domain which will return JS which will then force an HTTP request to 'tracker.com'... there could be many redirects, but an HTTP request to 'tracker.com' is involved, which automatically contains the unique identifier in your cookie.<p>'Tracker.com' then uses that unique ID to look up what it knows about you, potentially supplements that with location based off your IP address, and potentially appends some guesses about demographic info made from the content of the site you're visiting and the type of folks that tend to live in your ZIP code.  It then uses all of this (or passes all of this on to another party) to select a related advertisement.

I'm not saying that there was not competition, or that their success was because they were first - they still gave superior products which beat any rivals at the time.<p>However, trying to draw parallels with these site's design and success today is not totally relevant. If you launched either of them today as they were / are, they may not succeed (despite as we know, the core product / service / functionality being great).<p>Rob Walling writes in his book that these days:\n'It's Market(ing) First, aesthetics second and functionality third'.<p>Firstly you need to have a market for your product and hopefully be able to market it well enough to get people to 'want your product' / know you exist.<p>Then when they look at your site, you need the aesthetics to give a first impression of your product and gain trust from your customers in your product. \nIt doesn't matter if your service / functionality is brilliant. If you can't get the user to even try you over any competitor, then you've wasted your time.<p>Then thirdly, if you're lucky to achieve the top two - give your customers a good user experience / functionality they want, so hopefully they pay / keep coming back.<p>The reason the sites given in the example can happily remain ugly, is because they already have the user's trust and are a known 'experience'. Therefore the aesthetics don't need to  work as hard to make an impression as say a newly formed start up today.<p>- EDIT... I'm not saying that a site which is kept basic in design can't be successful. Infact, I agree quite heavily with the principle of keeping things simple and have blogged about it in the past.<p>Perhaps the original author should've done the article on one of the many great sites over the last few years, which have embraced this 'Keep it simple and clean' attitude. Hacker news being a perfect example.",1280952044

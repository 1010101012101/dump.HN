I estimate we could have all the schemes in agreement by... 2025?

6736330,comment,6734607,6734607,48,0,austenallred,,,"I had a really hard time reading this, mostly because it&#x27;s difficult for me to separate out in my mind when arbitrage becomes theft.<p>For example, in my teens I found a hack in the eBay search algorithm. The algorithm was very simple; it simply scanned the titles. So if I input &#x27;32GB Apple iPod Black&#x27; it would return everything with those keywords. If, however, I typed in &#x27;iPod&#x27; it would return millions of results and be unusable. Not everybody realized this, however, so there were plenty of items just titled &quot;iPod.&quot;<p>I ended up generating a 2-page long search that stared with iPod and negated all non-relevant terms (i.e. &#x27;ipod -headphones -case -protector -battery&#x27; etc.). After entering in that term I would be given a page of everything only titled &#x27;iPod,&#x27; and could pick them up for $50-100 and flip them the next day for $250-300. That was a good living for a 15-year-old kid.<p>When my mom began to probe after seeing iPods arriving at the house day after day, she started to question me, and we had a long philosophical discussion about whether or not what I was doing was &quot;right.&quot; It was legal, of course, but was it <i>right?</i> - this was the much more important question in the eyes of my mom. She felt it was unethical and not providing value - I disagreed, and she allowed me to continue and not go against my conscience.<p>After a few interesting twists and turns the eBay hack turned into a multi-million dollar, off-eBay Broadway ticket brokerage firm. (We scalped broadway tickets at scale.) I provided no real value other than buying tickets at face value a long time in advance, and marking the prices up 3-4x last minute. I justified it by saying wall-street traders don&#x27;t provide much value either. I let people wait to buy tickets, and let Capitalism decide who would get the tickets instead of who got word of the shows first or who cared the most. I appeased my conscience by convincing myself that I took the risk away from the venues, who could have waited and charged more, and profited thereby, but either didn&#x27;t know it or were bound into agreements with artists/shows/etc. I still don&#x27;t know how truthful that was, but eventually I left to try and start something that will actually <i>benefit</i> people, not just redistribute things and make money.<p>I wonder now if I was on a slippery slope and got off at just the right moment. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of my ticket broker/scalper friends end up trying to swindle casinos, get caught up in credit card fraud, etc; it becomes easy to feel smarter-than-thou when you&#x27;re making bunches of money off of others&#x27; perceived negligence.<p>But at the same time I&#x27;m not the kind of successful where I can look back and say, &quot;I was dumb and broke the rules and made some mistakes, but look, I made it now!&quot; It&#x27;s tempting to slip back into a world where you&#x27;re not benefiting anybody and profiting thereby. So in that sense it&#x27;s hard to separate my motives then from that of the author. Making money while helping people is really, really, really hard.<p>The moral of the story: It&#x27;s difficult for me, at times, to discern when a &quot;cool hack&quot; becomes &quot;criminal theft.&quot;",1384469845

Maybe that&#x27;s changed in the past few years, but I am skeptical.<p>The second issue is it&#x27;s solving a problem that isn&#x27;t really a problem. I use two cards on a regular basis. I have others but rarely need to carry them with me. So I can reduce two slots in my wallet to one. Doesn&#x27;t seem like enough of a benefit to me.<p>Lastly, I can see all sorts of issues with merchants not knowing what these are, and being wary of accepting them due to perceived fraud risk. Something that reprograms its mag stripe practically yells &quot;FRAUD!&quot;.<p>So I appreciate the technical innovation behind this, but I think they&#x27;re likely to get dashed upon the rocks. It&#x27;s a tough space. I thought Google Wallet with Android NFC would be super convenient. It wasn&#x27;t. I went back to the old fashioned swipe. So its hard to see this catching on with ordinary consumers.",1384469503

They all accept PIN numbers, and I &quot;believe&quot; magnetic-strip as well (not sure if they&#x27;re doing fancy stuff too with built-in chips or not). It&#x27;s the standard that everyone uses; debit card and credit cards alike.<p>To change that to support different tech, you&#x27;d have to upgrade all of the ATM machines, all of the credit cards, and all of the backend tech. That&#x27;s a lot of coordination between banks/credit-card companies. On top of that you have POS systems in stores which are all magnetic-strip based as well, accepting PINs and/or signatures.<p>Any sort of switch would have to be phased-in over years and require a lot of buy-in. Unless retailers, banks, ATM providers, and credit card companies have a good business case to do so, they probably won&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;d imagine it would be easier for some other type of technology which displaces cards entirely, like phone-based payments, would eventually replace all of this.

At the other extreme, antibiotics are used in situations where these cannot be expected to improve the patient&#x27;s condition, particularly as treatment for the common cold and uncomplicated cases of diarrhoea (which are appropriately treated with oral rehydration therapy).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/policy-and-issues/antibiotic-resistance-in-india-high-survey/article2512475.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/policy-and-issues/an...</a><p>> <i>The rise is substantial in the retail sector where antibiotics are mostly sold without a prescription,</i>",1384468295

The next four Mercury missions (1962-1963) used modified Atlas rockets (Atlas LV-3B&#x27;s specifically, which were man-rated Atlas D&#x27;s)  These Atlas rockets were America&#x27;s first ICBMs.  Atlas rockets continued to be used for space launches for several more years, launching target vehicles for docking with during Gemini, launching a few space probes, etc.  Literally dozens of Atlas D ICBMs were used as launch vehicles for damn near half a century.   Some of the first GPS satellites were put up on Atlas rockets.<p>The Gemini missions (1965-1966) continued this tradition,  all using man-rated Titan IIs (ICBMs, but with more redundancy for reliability).  In the years that followed, the Titan II continued to be used for satellite launches, and like the Atlas, spawned a successful line of derivative launch vehicles.<p>The point that I am making here is that ICBMs worked swimmingly as launch vehicles, and weren&#x27;t just pushed onto NASA for a task that they weren&#x27;t fit to perform.  Slap a Centaur/Agena/etc on top and they can do a hell of a lot, and with a few added redundancies, they got men into space brilliantly.

Am I wrong?<p>Yes, you are, in fact, wrong. Google doesn&#x27;t have so narrow a vision. Dart is server and client side (the native VM is, aside from a for-testing-only build, server-side only now.) But the client side isn&#x27;t just Dart (or JS, in which Google has also invested heavily), its also C/C++, and other languages, hence PNaCl, which also just went into general release.<p>And, sure, Go is <i>a</i> server-side language that Google is putting energy into, but so is Dart. And I doubt their vision ends there, those are just a couple of the more visible active fronts.<p>> I would expect Google, or at least, a team at Google, to take over NodeJS which is based on their V8 and expand it to universal server client language and libs.<p>The existing NodeJS team is doing enough for server-side JS-on-V8, and its open source -- Google could throw more resources, but its probably not the best bang-for-their buck in terms of developing new technologies that might improve the options for the things Google is concerned about. Doing what other people <i>aren&#x27;t</i> doing is a bigger win.<p>> Let alone I see no effort on their side bringing any of those language into the native world of Android<p>I&#x27;ve seen quite a bit about Dart on Android (though I think there are issues with building the current distribution.)

I&#x27;m not the primary engineer on this, but here&#x27;s my understanding:<p>If we add nodes to an existing Kafka cluster, those nodes own no partitions and therefore send/receive no traffic. A rebalancing event must occur for these servers to become active. Bouncing Kafka on one of the active nodes is one way to trigger such an event.<p>Fortunately, cluster resizing is infrequent. Unfortunately, network interruptions are not (at least on EC2).<p>When ZooKeeper detects a node failure (however brief), the node is removed from the active pool and the partitions are rebalanced. This is desirable. But when the node comes back online, no rebalancing takes place. The server remains inactive (as if it were a new node) until we trigger a rebalancing event.<p>As a result, we have to bounce Kafka on an active server every few weeks in response to network blips. 0.8 alleges to handle this better, but we&#x27;ll see.<p>Handle-jiggling aside, I&#x27;m a fan of Kafka and the types of systems you can build around it.

There are far too many combinatorial logical possibilities, not to mention the fact that a mature codebase becomes so fractured and diverse that nobody really knows what&#x27;s going on at any given code location.<p>Meanwhile, my coworker would confidently answer with whatever he thought was correct.  He would often be close, but he would also, alarmingly often, be completely wrong, to the point of describing behavior that had nothing to do with the product in question.<p>As luck would have it, none of his lies/misrepresentations ever mattered.  Whatever prompted the questions ended up being unimportant, or the support issue was resolved through other means.

My GlobalCard fu is not well honed enough to tell you what ADPU you&#x27;d need to invoke in order to try, but it goes against the goals of the product to allow this anyway.<p>Two, if a credit card company provides you with an EMV card, it&#x27;s got a private key loaded into the card, and may have even originally been generated on the card.  It is outright not allowed under any circumstance to download that private key and upload it to another chip; that would be a major hole in the scheme.<p>Three, not all banks use the same crypto.  Even if they all agreed to a single kind of crypto operation, different EMV chips have different performance characteristics when carrying out crypto operations.  If the bank can&#x27;t control the actual EMV chip any more, then they cannot control elements of their payments processing (e.g. session closure within a certain time frame).  This problem is the easiest to solve of these three problems.<p>So, unless the banks get on board with allowing their apps and their keys to be provisioned on an already existing card, or provide some kind of proxy mechanism whereby an EMV card can delegate another card to act on its behalf (and imagine the security concerns with that) then this isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>I don&#x27;t see the benefit to the banks for doing this.  You&#x27;re far more likely to see paypal succeeding in turning your phone into your wallet (and they are doing it) then you are to see Visa or MC allowing you to link multiple EMV cards into one.",1384467019

The giant is a good thing.<p>The weight of history (I just made it up) is used more negatively, though much that ties us down is indeed valuable. But when trying to do something new you will be constrained by the structures history has left us. This is both good and bad.<p>Given the English connotation of giants from the existing quote, I&#x27;d avoid using it in the sense you meant.",1384466514

If a giant&#x27;s invention of X made Y and Z wildly popular, then we often assume that when designing A, if we want to replicate Y and Z&#x27;s success, we should start with X.<p>That is, however, not the case. You need to work from the needs of A, and find solutions to those problems regardless of how the giants did things. The giants likely weren&#x27;t wrong. It&#x27;s just that your problem is different than theirs, and so their solutions, no matter how great they are, may not be appropriate.",1384466480

You see this in software projects where there&#x27;s always the temptation to start from scratch, but once in this process there&#x27;s inherently a lot more bugs and quality control becomes an issue (even though the old clunky system feels low quality, functionally it can be expected to be reasonably error free).",1384466409

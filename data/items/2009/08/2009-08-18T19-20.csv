Heartland was contacted by Visa Security in October 2008. This means that the hackers were sniffing transactions inside the datacenter for 10 months. Since all transactions inside their datacenter were in the clear, I suspect the number actually acquired by the hackers is about 10x what the official news is stating.<p><a href=""http://www.storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/heartland-sniffer-hid-in-unallocated-portion-of-disk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/heartland-sn...</a><p>Maybe I'm getting too cynical in my old age, but Heartland released the news of the attack <i>during</i> Obama's inauguration, hoping it would get lost in the noise.<p>Some more reading:

This would seem to be the best of both worlds, by using the star optimally.<p>In general, this seems like a lesson to not focus so much on the ""strongest point"", but try to squeeze out more returns from weaker points before diminishing returns set in so heavily.

771308,comment,770439,770684,0,0,mjw,,,"Genuinely interested here in what you'd propose as an alternative.<p>Separating model logic from presentational logic helps me a lot in client side code.<p>Then the 'two models' problem seems inescapable if you want to divide the load of model-level computation between client and server.<p>Sure, if you do all the non-trivial computation server-side, then the client-side model becomes less important. But sometimes you need to do more complex computation in the client, whether for UI latency or scalability reasons. If you didn't, you'd just be writing a traditional server-side web app (which of course is fine, but not what we're talking about).<p>On the other hand, if you do most of the computation client-side, the server-side can be a relatively trivial persistence layer, and sometimes that works out really well. But even if all you're doing is calling on a persistence layer, it can still require a fair bit of bookkeeping logic in your client-side model code. versioning, caching and cache expiry, object identity, managing consistency of local copies of denormalised data etc.<p>As for 'two controllers', I'm not sure I get what you mean there. In most verisons of MVC I've seen, the controller talks to both model and view, not just the view. But it is a poorly-defined term.<p>Personally I prefer an approach something like ""M + Tree(V + C)"". That is, a model layer, and then a tree of 'widgets' or user-interface components, each of which has its own controller and view logic. Widgets may create and manage child widgets. etc. Finding this works quite well, especially when you throw data-binding into the mix too.<p>Agree that the 'VV' approach you describe sounds quite a crazy optimisation, depending on how far you take it. Although might make more sense if you have more of a unified development environment between client and server eg GWT or a javascript-based server framework.",1250624925

Gossip is not a good way to determine who the good guys and bad guys are.  In the cases described, what's freaking people out is their neighbors being noisy and dirty and keeping odd hours.  These are class and cultural differences which, I will admit, are really annoying and (I assume) strongly associated with criminal activity, but people should be held responsible for behavior that is observed and documented, not serious criminal behavior that is statistically inferred from violations of decorum.  You can easily make a neighborhood more pleasant and secure by running out all the poor people, or all the black people, or all the straight people.  Or the Irish.  That's stereotyping.  (It works, bitches!  But it's wrong.)<p>You want to raise the tenor of the neighborhood, broken-windows style?  Then use existing laws or HOA rules about trash and noise.

Despite being (say) as easy as Wordpress, it just won't fit into today's journalist's worldview. But that's OK, journalists as we know them are a dying breed -- many just don't know it yet.<p>What could happen is (a) the rise of a new class of low-cost, low-profit ""mini-publishers"" using new turnkey applications to design content+layouts that appeal to their target audience. Then (b) what we think of today as ""journalists"", both newswriters and columnists, will disappear from the ""news"" industry. Columnists have already largely gone to blog but the newswriters have yet to change. My guess is that change will be forced upon them, and newswriters who want to continue in journalism will need to adapt. How? Possibly by becoming their own newswire. Instead of a few large wire services (AP and ilk) we will see thousands of individual ""wire services"", basically individuals covering local, family and/or specialty events. Few if any will be making a lot of money at this, but that's because of the economics of Internet news. The days of Clark Gable (and Clark Kent) journalism are over.<p>The key to all this is having a turnkey newspaper-in-a-box application that lets wannabe publishers design their own interfaces, choose their own content suppliers and publish on their own schedule. That's what YC should be funding. It's where the money (if any) will be made.<p>It also occurs to me that there is a business opportunity in helping folks start their own mini-wire-services. Structure the whole thing from scratch. Standardized processes for submission of news articles plus standardized usage and reimbursement terms (Michael Yon might be able to charge more than Jan Michael), but the process of choosing and using their output would be the same.<p>Maybe that's not the correct vision of the future, but I'm still sure the profession of ""journalist"" is going to change. Throw out today's molds and take a stab at what makes most sense to you. There's a fistful of dollars somewhere in there.",1250624727

You say there should be just one social network?</i><p>I didn't say the Internet is broken because authentication is a pain. I said the Web has been created to deal (and access) hypertexts. Nowadays the WWW is used for much more. People use it to shop, keep contacts with friends living far away, some use it to share their ""lives"" and the current state of art is far from being functional to the scope. To my personal point of view, it is broken by design when it comes to these scopes. And far from me trying to say there should be just a social network.<p>The gateway I idealize is not a giant bucket (or a silo) you'd fill with your stuff, that's exactly what I want to avoid. The ""gateway"" would just be a place you use to authenticate and authorize apps to access subsets of your data. Some of it (anagraphical data for the most part) would be stored on the gateway, and other stuff would be in much more appropiate places. Flickr, Twitter, Blogger, Facebook, et cetera. The model I idealize would be a common layer to build thing on, nothing more and nothing less.",1250624242

(Of course, jobs <i>doing something</i>; if you have evidence that NASA is in fact paying people to do nothing, or to do useless things, then please feel free to provide it.)<p>I didn't take offence about anything. I mentioned that the slide was taken out of context because, er, it was, and that might be relevant -- e.g., because there is a considerable difference between ""we decide whether a project is worth while by looking at whether it will provide jobs"" and ""we decide whether a project is worth while by looking at a dozen things, one of which is whether it will provide jobs"".<p>For instance: Suppose one of the other slides says that a criterion they use is some measure of efficiency: useful stuff achieved per unit money or time spent. Then what seems to me to be the <i>only</i> reason for objecting to ""more jobs => better"" largely goes away. (Let's have an even more specific, albeit rather artificial, example: suppose two of their metrics are ""jobs provided"" and ""likely stuff achieved per job provided"", and suppose the way they combine them is to multiply together.

I have not discovered anything new.""  There are problems that you can ""solve in polynomial time"" by encoding the problem as some HUGE number (where the number of bits is exponential in the size of the problem) and doing arithmetic.  This is where you really see the breakdown of the constant time arithmetic model.",1250622404

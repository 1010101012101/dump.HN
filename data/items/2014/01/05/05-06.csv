7014780,comment,7013874,7013874,4,0,fossuser,,,"There was a good write up of the context surrounding this letter in Steven Levy&#x27;s book, Hackers (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer.."" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer...</a>).<p>It pissed off lots of people in the community and seemed to be against the spirit of what the hackers were doing at the time (writing and sharing code).<p>I recall another programmer being irritated by the letter and writing his own basic interpreter and asking $5 for it (which was far less than what Gates was asking).<p>Book is worth reading for the historical context of computing if you weren&#x27;t around to see it.<p>####<p>Edit [Relevant part of wikipedia page]:\nTiny BASIC: Altair BASIC was an interpreter that translated instructions from the BASIC programming language into assembly instructions that the Altair 8800 could understand. It was developed by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, the founders of Micro-soft, specifically for the Altair 8800 and it would fit in 4K of memory. Unlike previous hackers and against the Hacker Ethic, Micro-Soft and MITS felt that people should pay for BASIC just like they paid for any add-on card. Many hackers had in fact put in orders for BASIC, but still had to wait for the order to be shipped. During a show put up by MITS, someone got hold of and copied a paper tape containing Altair BASIC.<p>The tapes were duplicated and passed around freely before the commercial product was even shipped to customers. Gates and Allen did not appreciate this turn of events since they were actually paid commission for each copy of BASIC that MITS sold. Gates responded by writing an open letter titled “Open Letter to Hobbyists” that considered the sharing of software to be theft. Tiny BASIC was a similar interpreter that would fit in only 2K of memory as it supported a subset of the functionality of Micro-Soft BASIC (which itself was a subset of Dartmouth BASIC).<p>It was developed by Dick Whipple and John Arnold in Tyler, Texas and distributed freely in PCC magazine. Many more people sent in improvements and programs developed in Tiny BASIC to be published. This eventually led to the creation of Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal edited by Jim Warren that distributed free or very inexpensive software in response to Gates&#x27; claims of theft. Tom Pittman was someone else who did not take kindly to Gates&#x27; words. He wrote a version of Tiny BASIC for the Motorola 6800 microprocessor.<p>Although he sold it to AMI for $3,500, he retained the rights to sell it to others and decided to charge only $5 for it. He received many orders and even money from people who had already gotten a copy and simply wanted to pay him for his efforts. Pittman also wrote the essay “Deus Ex Machina” on the AI and hardware hackers and what tied them together. Lee Felsenstein and Bob Marsh banded together to create a fully contained computer for an issue of Popular Electronics that they called SOL that sold for under a thousand dollars.<p>####",1388901463

7014752,comment,7013509,7014503,1,0,cjo,,,"OK, I&#x27;ll respond to this and harryh&#x27;s at the same time.  First of all, &quot;distortion&quot; is relative to what economic model you&#x27;re starting with - so it can get a bit tricky, and I&#x27;m not very concerned with using the absolute correct technical term.  But I&#x27;ll make my case from the ground up:<p>Unemployment has a downward effect on wages because there&#x27;s more competition for every job, just like competition between firms for employees will increase wages.  Ideally these things will all even out.  Unfortunately in our current economy we have high market concentration (so low competition between firms for employees which decreases wages) and high unemployment (so high competition for each job which also decreases wages).  So we see lower wages from what they would be under Perfect Competition (or an ideally functioning free market) where I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s impossible for these things to persist.<p>Minimum wage laws put a limit on how much firms can wield this market power given to them by market conditions.  Without minimum wage/collective bargaining of some sort (and without technological advances, etc.) history and economic theory agree that firms will tend to push wages down to subsistence levels in order to maximize profits.  Minimum wage is not the greatest tool, and I don&#x27;t actually like it - but I do think it should be higher.  We have a lack of good options at the moment so we&#x27;re left picking the best of the bad.<p>But why do I call it a distortion?  Large enough unemployment, coupled with lack of competition between firms for employees causes such a shift that the free market is barely distinguishable from slavery for those at the bottom (subsistence wages are literally only enough to survive and keep working.)  So I throw around the word distortion because I&#x27;m trying to communicate that unemployment gives such a large amount of market power to employers that the market becomes <i>fundamentally different</i> from what we expect in a Free Market.",1388900832

I was newly a cathedral chorister annd had had a lot of classical music lessons (piano, singing, even recorder) and exposure since I was 4. I just remembered what C was, assuming other people could do that.<p>However, it&#x27;s variable, and I had to work on tuning over the next few years to calibrate my sense of pitch, because choirs go out of tune when unaccompanied, as we sometimes were. It was good practice, but I did become somewhat obsessed with knowing &quot;correct&quot; pitch. There are others with much more finely-tuned perfect pitch, including some who claim to hear 1/8 semitone very easily. I was never that precise, and even having not played or sung much music for a few years recently (never really bought into the magic, but loved the music, so not much church really) found my pitch calibration had dropped a semitone, although this could be general memory confusion because of all the Baroque music I did at one point in time.",1388898974

There, the NSA can command a CA based in the U.S. to issue them an intermediary CA cert which would allow them to do active MITM for nearly all servers in the world. (They would still need the individual service providers&#x27; private keys to do passive MITM and decrypt already-captured traffic, though.)<p>With just self-signed certificates, the NSA would need an individual&#x27;s private key. The problem here is that there&#x27;s no third party to confirm that public key X really belongs to your friend Jane and not the NSA, and thus it&#x27;s hard to confirm that you&#x27;re actually speaking directly to Jane, and not to Jane through the NSA. This is a hard problem, and one of the most effective workarounds we have is the support in OTR (typically used over XMPP) for the socialist millionaire protocol, which is a way for two people to confirm that they both know some low-entropy secret that they exchanged over an outside channel/in person, e.g. &quot;batman&quot;, without revealing what the secret actually is.

You do <i>not</i> have a Fourth Amendment right to avoid having your UPS parcel searched by UPS.<p>Does this mean that the government can simply tell UPS to open your UPS parcel to evade the Fourth Amendment? It&#x27;s not UPS&#x27;s personal property so they have no Fourth Amendment protection to the parcel. And you have no Fourth Amendment protection from UPS.<p>But as it turns out once UPS acts under the direction and control of the government, they also have to comply with the <i>strictures</i> on the government. So they cannot legally be made to violate the Fourth Amendment on behalf of the government.<p>The big catch is that a third party may voluntarily divulge information (e.g. if they rip open your parcel by accident while throwing it out the truck on Christmas Eve and a bomb spills out, they can tell the government). But they can&#x27;t do so on request of the government.<p>And so it is for GCHQ and NSA. GCHQ could conceivably tip off the NSA if they happen to get evidence of a US person plotting a terrorist act (much like the USA might tip off Germany to a German national, if it were discovered). But the NSA can&#x27;t ask GCHQ to deliver information on a US person.

This is wasteful in it&#x27;s massive redundancy.  How many times have I seen the neophyte make a mistake when trying to link SDL?  I&#x27;ve beyond lost count.  And that&#x27;s one of the super easy cases.<p>> For every non-language feature you push into the standard, you increase the amount of coupling the compiler has to an OS.<p>And decrease the amount of coupling the end programs have to the OS, the number of which hopefully significantly outnumber the compiler.  All this assuming we&#x27;re talking about functionality that must interoperate with the OS of course -- things like new container types have no such concerns.<p>> The problem of package and configuration management is an OS problem<p>> The way we maintain packages should be agnostic of any particular OS or language<p>These two statements directly conflict with each other by my parsing.  I agree in theory with the latter, but in practice things like #include path configuration are fundamentally language specific.  In some distant land of the future where package management is a solved problem, lean standard libraries might make more sense.  However, it&#x27;d take some convincing to convince me package management is even a <i>solvable</i> problem in the generalized case.<p>OS focused package managers like RPMs and APT have as a rule caused me far more work than they&#x27;ve solved.  They don&#x27;t have the versions I need, they don&#x27;t configure things for the platforms I need, they don&#x27;t run on the OSes I need.  Even for something as fundamental as, say, integrating the boost libraries, I&#x27;ve found that the moment I want to go beyond &quot;hello world&quot; it&#x27;s simpler to completely ignore APT entirely and build the bloody thing yourself.<p>Non-OS package managers like PIPs, RubyGems, Cpan Modules, NuGet packages, etc. I&#x27;ve had more luck with.  I&#x27;ve heard good arguments against standardization of libraries in the python world -- why freeze the API and discourage competition when package management is easy and works?<p>I&#x27;ve yet to see anything resembling progress of a similar sort in the world of C++.  You say &quot;Nix is making great steps towards that capability, which don&#x27;t require adding bloat to existing solutions&quot; -- but I&#x27;ve yet to see it.  I suspect I never will: I suspect it&#x27;d take over a decade to become a proper force, and more interest in solving the problem than I&#x27;ve seen.  I suspect those who would solve such problems are instead writing entire new languages and ecosystems that will one day relegate C++ to the world of legacy programming, leaving behind so much language cruft.<p>> The C++ Committee are attempting to solve the problem in a different way - by saying &quot;we&#x27;ll handle everything for you&quot;. What about adding libraries to ISO C++ for scraping websites, or accessing RDBMS, parsing text, or one of the dozens of common programming problems that exist? Why graphics in particular, and where do we stop attempting to push things into the standard? Screw it, why don&#x27;t we just make ISO C++ a standard operating system?<p>What&#x27;s your stance on the .NET Framework?  It sounds like the poster child that could have inspired this paragraph in frustration, or perhaps you don&#x27;t consider that a standard library.  It has libraries for scraping websites, accessing RDBMs, parsing text, and many of the dozens of common programming problems that exist, including graphics.  You might call it emacs syndrome.  I say it&#x27;s a damn sight better than where C++&#x27;s currently at, even if it has given me grief trying to port Mono.<p>> It&#x27;s used in embedded systems, and they have the exact opposite problems you describe - the trouble of taking things out of the language, rather than putting them in.<p>This, at least, I&#x27;m willing to not label a corner case.  But even C++&#x27;s existent pitifully tiny standard library outlines some parts that don&#x27;t need to be made available on embedded targets, and I see no reason such a graphics library wouldn&#x27;t also be so outlined, or particularly difficult to &quot;take out&quot;.",1388898564

Let's consider the following scenario: every time you wrote something down on paper, there was a chance the paper would spontaneously burst into flame.  There are strict, reproducible rules governing when the paper would and would not catch on fire.  People go to school to learn these rules, which are varied and subtle.<p>In this world I've described, is the best writer a person who can write the most essays that don't spontaneously combust?  I feel like as programmers we think that because we can easily quantify whether something works, we can also quantify whether it's <i>good</i>.  Or worse, that everything which doesn't burn away is essentially the same: just words on paper.<p>It's simply not true.

479537,comment,478807,479433,0,0,geebee,,,"You're correct that India accounts for most of the H1B visas, but my comment was actually referring to the companies that bring in H1B workers, not the nationality of the H1B workers themselves.  Here's a link to an article on msnbc:<p><a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17048048/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17048048/</a><p>""data for the fiscal year 2006, which ended last September, show that 7 of the top 10 applicants for H-1B visas are Indian companies. Giants Infosys Technologies and Wipro took the top two spots, with 22,600 and 19,400 applications, respectively. The company with the third most applications is Cognizant Technology Solutions, which is based in Teaneck, N.J., but has most of its operations in India. All three companies provide services to U.S. companies from India, including technology support and back-office processing.""<p>This article raises the point that H1B visas may actually facilitate and accelerate the trend toward moving jobs offshore.  Some people think this is a worthy goal - source the labor where it can be provided most economically.  But then we should be honest about it, and agree that our national policy will be to assist foreign corporations in moving development jobs offshore.  Then our own young people can take that into consideration, along with our government's decision to protect sectors like law from foreign competition, when choosing a graduate degree and career.<p>I also disagree with you that the writer of the article is opposed to immigration, and he definitely makes a strong case <i>against</i> the claim of ""playing a race card"".  Here's the quote from his article:<p>""What's more, the H-1B issue is separate from the debate concerning an overhaul of sadly confused and outdated immigration framework as a whole. Friedman's hardworking Indian immigrants would still have an opportunity to come to the United States and make their contributions as citizens-to-be if H-1B were suspended, using the regular immigration framework.""<p>So this writer is clearly not opposed to Indians (among others) immigrating to the US.<p>The question is: should there be a special visa program designed specifically to bring more engineers to the United States than we'd get through the normal process of immigration?<p>It's a reasonable question, but it really is separate from the more general question of whether people should be allowed to pursue a better life through immigration to the US, or even whether we should try to bring more ""educated people"" here in a general sense.<p>The H1B is used specifically to increase the number of engineers, and it seems pretty obvious to me that if you do that to engineering but not to other fields, you'll deter young Americans from entering engineering <i>relative to other fields that are not targeted by work visas</i>.",1234505847

479533,comment,479165,479165,0,0,ocskills,,,"The future is here already, and has been for decades.<p>These non-relational database structures are not a new or revolutionary idea. The same concepts have long been implemented in systems like LDAP, X.500, and document-oriented databases like Lotus Domino.<p>The real mystery is the recent trend towards completely reinventing the wheel. For instance, LDAP (the protocol) is incredibly efficient, standardized, and well supported on most development platforms. It provides a standard query / filter language, facilities for scoping, and data updates. There are standardized exchange formats, wide availability of OSS and commercial management tools, and multiple server implementations.<p>Yet, there seems to be a great interest in developing from scratch highly proprietary and non-portable alternatives that do exactly the same thing (or less). These systems ignore decades of research and lessons learned through practical implementation.<p>The real issue though is that direct comparison of the two models is inherently flawed. They each have their own strengths and weaknesses, each excelling in situations that the other falls short. Looking at them as complementary models is perhaps a better approach.",1234505533

You could walk away with just <i>one</i> fistful of cash, or you could return it to me, and I'd give you another re-upped card.  You win, I win.<p>Think about the math, as well.  They took $9m from ATMs.. how many people could they possibly have been using?  Even with 1,000 ""cashers"" (highly unlikely), thats $9,000 each... far more than just 1 run to the ATM.<p>What they most likely did, or at least what I would do, is get a map of ATMs, find the points which yield the least weighted distance to the most ATMs (an NP problem, but very much worth it in this case), and set-up a ""re-up"" station there.  Instruct your cashers to return their used card to these stations, along with the bundle of cash (or maybe x% of it), and you'll give them another card.  Good worker ants.<p>However, something seems off here. $9m from 130 ATMs, that's $70,000 per ATM.  With a max of at most $1,000 per transaction, thats 70 hits per ATM.  In 30 minutes.  So you mean to tell me each of 130 ATMs was hit for $1000 every 30 seconds?<p>Something is off about that.

479525,comment,479314,479501,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"I think the reason finding good measures of productivity is because of some inherent properties of math. If a programmer sits and thinks for a bit, they may find a more (time/speed/memory) efficient way to implement something in fewer lines of code. The complement to that is that they might just implement something really fast in a brain dead way. Because these are mathematical algorithms, the various rules about provability apply.<p>Really, the only way to measure programmer productivity is how fast they can implement a perfectly detailed spec. If you have some unknowns in there, your measurements will tell you nothing.<p>Therefore, I might suggest a test whereby two programmers are told to implement a program with a spec that is completely known, in the same language, and with the same set of libraries, in their perfered (or an independently chosen ) working environment. What this comes down to is just a race, and some people have good days, and some have bad days.<p>If you run this test several times with different specs, you might be able to objectively tell whom is better given those environmental characteristics. Of course, these measurements will be nearly useless in a real project environment for the reasons cited in the first paragraph.",1234505286

         The crawl order was best-first search, using the OPIC metric. The crawl was started from about 
         25 million URLs that either i) had high OPIC values in a web graph produced from an earlier 200 
         million page crawl, or ii) were ranked highly by a commercial search engine for one of 16,000 
         sample queries in one of 10 languages. This dataset covers web content in English, Chinese, Spanish,

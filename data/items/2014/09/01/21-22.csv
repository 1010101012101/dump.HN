Therefore it must have the same logical pitfalls as the class of study it caricatures.<p>Is there a suggestion that psychiatrists or psychologists have control groups that work? Does the expression &quot;no-treatment control&quot; sound familiar? It&#x27;s an often-seen expression in psychiatry and psychology studies. It results from an awareness that real scientists have control groups, but because of the nature of psychological studies, that&#x27;s often not practical (imagine a study comparing therapeutic methods -- how would one design a realistic faux therapy for control purposes?).<p>But these people want the appearance of science, so they call those denied treatment a &quot;no-treatment control&quot;. &quot;Send him home, we&#x27;re not treating him.

All real sciences have such a corpus of theory, it&#x27;s falsifiable and it informs all work in the field, psychiatry doesn&#x27;t have one. Psychiatrists are free to go in any direction they please, even contradict each other on matters of substance, and without a basis in theory. It&#x27;s not science.",1409608499

8254797,comment,8252208,8254284,1,0,Ogre,,,"Partly answering my own question after mulling it over, the difference in the pre-pass is that you&#x27;re not actually coming &quot;from&quot; an edge or going &quot;to&quot; one when you&#x27;re doing the flood fills, you&#x27;re just testing which edges are connected to any given empty cell.  But I still think there might be something to this idea.  The simplest thing I can think of is to do no-backwards searches out from all the empty cells on each edge  and see which other edges you reach.  That&#x27;s potentially 6x as many searches (slightly smaller and with some early outs since the connectivity is bi-directional), but at least it&#x27;s still finite and predictable and isn&#x27;t who knows how many raycasts.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s acceptable for the pre-pass or not.  But I also think there might be smarter ways to do it that only require a single search from each empty cell but remember directions traversed so you know if a particular path you&#x27;ve reached an edge along implies visibility or not.<p>Maybe you can do the 6 searches in parallel, such that whenever they meet you know you&#x27;ve found a connection between the two edges they were coming from?  I don&#x27;t know if that means any less work except in cases where all 6 edges are trivially connected.",1409607906

I&#x27;ve ripped out one of the examples from the README (which I think illustrates it well), but you could also wrap this in a method that you call on the instance of the struct you get back from (i.e.) gorilla/schema:<p><pre><code>    func ClearValidation(a, b, c MyType) (err error) {\n        err = BeginValidation().Validate(\n            IsNotNil(a, &quot;a&quot;),\n            IsNotNil(b, &quot;b&quot;),\n            IsNotNil(c, &quot;c&quot;),\n        ).CheckAndPanic().Validate( // Panic will occur here if a, b, or c are nil.\n            HasLen(a.Items, 50, &quot;a.Items&quot;),\n            GreaterThan(b.UserCount, 0, &quot;b.UserCount&quot;),\n            Equals(c.Name, &quot;Vala&quot;, &quot;c.name&quot;),\n            Not(Equals(c.FriendlyName, &quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;c.FriendlyName&quot;)),\n         ).Check()\n\n         if err != nil {\n             return err\n         }\n\n        // ...\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\nNote that for any reasonable amount of validation w/ structs (i.e. not nil, ranging over it automatically, etc) you will need reflection. There are no ifs or buts about that. But the whole &#x27;reflection is slow&#x27; mantra is premature optimisation: if you need reflection, you need it. Your template rendering uses reflection, your database connection introduces latency, etc - all of that dwarfs any cost associated with validating a struct or two.",1409607851

While DSM has been described as a “Bible” for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been “reliability” – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever. Indeed, symptom-based diagnosis, once common in other areas of medicine, has been largely replaced in the past half century as we have understood that symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment. <i>Patients with mental disorders deserve better</i>.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>> ... does not imply that the entire field of psychiatry is unscientific.<p>But I never made that claim anywhere, and certainly not with respect to Insel&#x27;s views -- I don&#x27;t need to. It&#x27;s sufficient to note that there&#x27;s no science in psychiatry. It&#x27;s sufficient to say that the DSM, the sum of psychiatric knowledge, is being discarded by the NIMH for the reason that is has no scientific content.<p>It&#x27;s sufficient to ask for the identity and location of the unifying corpus of theory in psychiatry, a theory that forges a consensus between psychiatrists, that demonstrates its scientific standing, a theory such as exists in every legitimate science without exception.<p>If you will name a science, I will tell you the theory that defines it and legitimizes it as a science. Even though all scientific theories are subject to falsification and many are in fact falsified, at any given time a central corpus of theory guides research and practice in each and every scientific field.<p>But for the sake of argument, let&#x27;s say the above isn&#x27;t a requirement for science, see where this takes us. Let&#x27;s say that we don&#x27;t need a falsifiable explanation for what we&#x27;re studying, that descriptions -- the descriptions that Insel complains about with respect to the DSM above -- are all we have. Is it still science?<p>This example may help you over this intellectual hurdle. An imaginary Doctor Dubious invents a new treatment for the common cold. His treatment is to shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until the patient gets better. Sometimes the treatment takes a week, but it always works — the cold sufferer always recovers. So, why doesn&#x27;t Doctor Dubious get a Nobel Prize for his breakthrough?<p>The answer is that the procedure is only a description — shake the gourd, patient recovers — without an explanation, without a basis for actually learning anything or being truthful about the connection between cause and effect.

Over-reliance on amicus briefs may be bad, but having one law professor complain and then writing a story around it isn&#x27;t much of a news article.<p>Some things I think I know about this subject. 1) SCOTUS is given broad latitude on how to do their job. Like complete latitude. One justice says publicly that they looked to foreign courts for guidance in resolving matters. That sounds totally whacked to me, but what do I know? 2) If you get the impression that the justices are sitting around the laptop, surfing the internet for blogs to agree with their preconceived opinions, you missed it. Each judge has a team of clerks whose job is to stay on top of both the case law and facts of the case. Justices are notorious for working the crap out of these folks and they&#x27;re expected to do their work flawlessly 3) AFAIK, the amicus briefs are never used to determine the outcome, but can be cited as supporting material. That means, by definition, that they could go away and it wouldn&#x27;t change the results. So the courts aren&#x27;t certifying some off-the-wall facts; they&#x27;re deciding based on the law and then citing all sorts of other things like the amicus briefs in their long-form opinions. Who knows if the same decisions would be made without those briefs?

If you think so, walk away from your terminal until you think the after image should be gone. Go home and try it in the morning. Then take a look. Or better, simply rotate the image. Well, maybe that isn&#x27;t so simple with a CRT, but you could rotate your head.&quot;</i><p>What you describe is a simple afterimage effect (<a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage#Negative_afterimages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage#Negative_afterimag...</a>).<p>The MacCullough effect is different because it lasts much longer (Wikipedia claims 3 _months_)<p>The McCullough effect is thought to be due to adaptation of edge detectors. &#x27;Normal&#x27; after images are thought to be caused by adaptation of cones.",1409605292
8254677,comment,8252800,8253583,1,0,bad_user,,,"If Kotlin is a small improvement over Java, then the benefits of picking it over Java are outweighed by the advantages of picking Java, by the simple fact that Java is probably the most popular language in the world and as a consequence it is being taught in schools, it has extremely good IDE support, it is very stable, the whole of Android&#x27;s documentation is written for it (so you can just copy/paste stuff) and so on.<p>Personally I do not care about how writing the actual code makes me feel or whatever, what I care about is how well the final artifact works versus the effort I&#x27;ve put in making it work. The act of learning and using a new language is completely useless if the new language doesn&#x27;t make possible and/or comfortable new abstractions that help me in managing complexity (that would be otherwise not possible or very painful in Java).<p>Therefore personally I&#x27;ll take languages like Scala or Clojure any day, because in spite of the learning experience being painful, at least I got something out of it.<p>N.B. - I don&#x27;t really know Kotlin, I only played with it and I don&#x27;t have an opinion on it yet - might turn out to be a good language for me, but I hope this will not be the reason promoted for using it, because it&#x27;s a very poor reason. Granted, it could be popular, just like CoffeeScript, but then again, I also hate CoffeeScript.<p>On the small JAR size - granted that&#x27;s useful, but Android apps tend to be compressed for distribution by means Proguard and Pack2000, which does tree-shaking, not perfect but theoretically you pay for what you use and in practice it works very well, not being worse than the result of importing dependencies in your project like from Apache Commons or Google&#x27;s Guava or whatever and paying a couple hundred KBs for it - which counts, but nothing tragic.",1409605291
8254676,comment,8253659,8254553,5,0,mjn,,,"I agree to some extent, and even wrote an op-ed along those lines a few years ago [1]. The issue with asymptotic algorithmic analysis isn&#x27;t only the constant-factors-matter one (which most people are aware of), but also that some heuristic algorithms are so good that they change the shape of the curve in typical usage, not only the constant offset. In practice, some problems that are supposed to scale as n^2 or n^3 or 2^n actually seem to scale linearly or sublinearly in practice. So asymptotic analysis can be a poor guide to algorithm selection in many places where it&#x27;s used.<p>On the other hand, I think recent trends are making worst-case analysis more relevant than it used to be, giving it something of a new lease on life. Many algorithms are now network-exposed in some form, in which a user can ultimately dictate or at least influence aspects of the input. That means a lot of systems need to worry about maliciously chosen input, or at least it&#x27;s safer to build them under the assumption that they do. That&#x27;s why Google wrote RE2 rather than using PCRE, for example. PCRE generally has good performance on real-world regexes, but it can be fairly easily forced into exponential performance if an adversary gets to pick the regex. That could conceivably be an issue for SAT-solving systems as well, if the problem comes directly or indirectly from a user. They typically run quickly on &quot;natural&quot; SAT problems derived from real-world situations, but it&#x27;s also known how to purposely generate likely-to-be hard problems [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/3779577376868/Selman95.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/3779577376868/...</a>",1409605266

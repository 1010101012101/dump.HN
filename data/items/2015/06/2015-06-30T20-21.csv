At least every successful lookup in such a tree with strings as keys also has to read the entire string.<p>This means that hashes probably still have an advantage over balanced binary trees. Tries, on the other hand, could really beat hashes when the keys are strings. In practice, they might have a cache and branching disadvantage, though.",1435697981

Black athletes in foreign countries <i>still</i> get bananas thrown at them on the field. I can assure you, this isn&#x27;t meant as a compliment.<p><pre><code>    Eberhardt described an experiment based on the
    Rodney King case. Participants viewed a video of
    police officers beating a Black suspect. Participants
    who saw words associated with apes before
    watching the video believed the officers’ actions 
    were more justified, compared to participants who 
    did not see the animal imagery. In a separate study, 
    Eberhardt found that people are more likely to 
    consider animal language (such as “barbaric,” 
    “animalistic,” etc.) appropriate and necessary in
    court cases of Black defendants compared to White 
    defendants. News articles describing Black 
    defendants are more likely to use animal language 
    than articles about White defendants.

    In addition, news articles of Blacks who received a 
    death sentence contain more animal language than 
    the articles of those with life sentences. “So not only 
    are Blacks associated with apes, but this 
    association is linked to justifications of violence and 
    death,” Eberhardt concluded. “It’s almost as though 
    the rules for what moral treatment is get shifted for 
    Black suspects and defendants.”

Whenever a type problem was detected, the error was reported and the type of the failed object was changed to an internal error type.  For any error in which an error type was involved, no message was generated. This avoided error cascading, something GCC inflicted on its users for decades.<p>For parse errors, display the line in error and mark correctly the item involved in the error.  Don&#x27;t just display the index into the source stream at the point the error was detected; that&#x27;s often a token or two beyond the problem.  Work back to the point at which things stopped making sense to the parser.  You have to carry source position info with each token, but it&#x27;s worth it.<p>For errors which represent an inconsistency between several parts of the source code, show all the places that conflict, not just one side of the conflict.  Rust is good about this. They have to be, because the borrow checker reports inconsistencies between different code sections, not just declarations and uses.",1435697135

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the whole recent model car thing is a barrier, you need credit; but have you seen how easy it is to get a car loan lately?<p>I think we have a different definition of poor. I&#x27;m not talking about someone who make $40k a year and lives paycheck to paycheck because they spend above their means. I&#x27;m talking about people making $15k a year (or less) at near minimum wage job. The kind of people who work in fast food.<p>>Also, a 2005 model year car is... not a high bar<p>For a person working 30 hours a week at a fast food restaurant that&#x27;s a very high bar. And you&#x27;re forgetting that Uber inspects the car as well, so the clunky beaters that nearly everyone drove when I worked retail during college aren&#x27;t going to pass inspection.<p>>Remember, in most parts of America, you need a reliable car for that job at Burger King, too.<p>Most people working at Burger King don&#x27;t have reliable cars. If they live outside of a mass transit area, they rely on friends and family when they have breakdowns. If you&#x27;ve ever managed retail employees (I was a geek squad supervisor in college), you&#x27;ll know just how frequently workers rely on other people to drop them off, or how often they call out because their car broke down.<p>> And once you factor in maintenance and gas, a 2000 model year really isn&#x27;t all that much cheaper than a 2005<p>That&#x27;s true. But this is a common problem that poor people face. They don&#x27;t have the money up front, so they take the cheaper up front option even though it&#x27;s more expensive over the long term.<p>>I&#x27;m comparing it to foodservice; and compared to burger king, from what I hear, it does pay pretty well.<p>Definitely, but for the average burger king worker buying a car to work for Uber isn&#x27;t a realistic goal. They don&#x27;t have the cash and they don&#x27;t have the credit to get a loan.<p>My point is, that there is no point comparing Uber to burger king because there is a very small intersection between people who are forced to work at burger king and people who can afford to work for Uber.<p>>My point is just that it&#x27;s pretty nice compared to a lower-class job.<p>Yes,but it has barriers to entry that keeps it from being an option for the working poor, so again there is no point in your comparison.<p>>40% of working-aged Americans, from what I read, have college degrees<p>If we&#x27;re talking about the same statistic, the 40% number was pretty inflated because it considered 2 year and professional degrees.<p>Also only 2.1% of people with a bachelor&#x27;s degree are classified as working poor (under the poverty level and working) while over 21% of people with no college degree are classified as working poor.<p>Since a college degree decreases your chance of being working poor by 10 times, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a a good discriminator.",1435696790

Instead of Java&#x27;s Comparable interface I was expecting a protocol, which are almost equivalent to type-classes, or a multi-method.<p>Of course, in many implementations you usually also get a version of a constructor that uses a provided comparison function. However certain things, like plain numbers or strings, have a natural ordering to them, hence the need to have the sorted-set in Clojure also work with Java&#x27;s Comparable. But again, I was expecting a Clojure specific protocol.<p>The reason for why this happens, I believe, is because protocols weren&#x27;t there from the beginning, being a feature introduced in Clojure 1.2.

This mechanism is already in place and working.<p>Currently transaction fees are negligible compared to the block reward.

And then it was my first that-awkward-stage-when-you&#x27;re-too-old-to-be-a-startup-but-still-don&#x27;t-have-proper-cashflow. Then it laid off 50% of the staff, then it went bankrupt, then it came back from the dead, then it went bankrupt again.<p>The lessons I learnt from Tao were:<p>1. Your company needs to be called something which people can pronounce. (&#x27;Where do you work?&#x27; &#x27;Tao.&#x27; &#x27;Dell?&#x27; &#x27;Er... no.&#x27;)<p>2. An OS which requires people to code for it in a language which only exists in-house is not going to get much external traction.<p>3. People don&#x27;t buy advanced technology and then figure out what to do with it. They figure out what they want to do and then buy the technology.<p>4. When the paycheques stop showing up, leave.<p>The technology was <i>great</i>. I joined just as TAOS was being migrated to intent. Both worked in the same sort of way; code was written in a custom portable assembly language, which was then translated into native machine code when it was loaded into the machine. The TAOS language was VP1, the intent one was VP2, and the first VP2 systems were hosted on TAOS, so it actually translated VP2 into VP1 and then into native. Translation was very, very fast; as both VP were pretty dense it was possible to load and translate VP faster than loading native code, on certain combinations of platforms.<p>VP1 had 16 registers and a pretty simple instruction set. The original incarnation was a assembler macro package. VP2 was way more complicated. It had five register banks (int32, int64, pointer, float, double) of up to 65535 registers each. It was actually a pretty nice system to program in, especially when the assembler got strong typing and structured programming support... yeah, I know what you&#x27;re thinking.<p>The OS itself was way ahead of its time: it was an asymmetric multiprocessor system, where you could have any number of nodes of different CPU types hooked together via a message-passing system. Code loading was transparent, and devices and filesystems could be attached to any node on the system. It had a blisteringly fast compositing GUI, cutting edge audio synthesis, hardware accelerated OpenGL, and eventually ran on, deep breath: 386 x86 ARM MIPS PowerPC MCore ColdFire Transputer ShBoom and a V, um, V840? Or something?<p>Our standard development procedure for new hardware was to have intent running (inside a Linux process) on a desktop PC; we&#x27;d bootstrap a development board up to the point of having serial support and the VP loader; then we&#x27;d hook them together. Suddenly, we have a two-node system. We could start a terminal on the desktop and see that node #0 was a Pentium and node #1 was, say, a ColdFire. You could then spawn a process on node #1 and it would run transparently on the dev board with full access to the desktop&#x27;s filesystem and device drivers, all running, quite slowly, over the serial link.<p>We had a TAOS-era demo box which was a 9-node system consisting of an elderly Pentium and eight transputer nodes; one of the demos was to draw a Mandelbrot, farming each scanline out to a different node. Alas, by the time the transputers had finished drawing their scanline, the Pentium had drawn the entire rest of the image...<p>We never, ever sold the multicore system to anyone. Back in those days it was too novel for customers to know what to do with. Instead we sold it as a embedded OS, which it did really well at. We had a JVM for it, which translated Java bytecodes into VP2, which meant we got, pretty much for free, a Java JIT to native machine code which didn&#x27;t require any additional porting; any system intent supported also supported Java. (See that list of architectures above? We had a Java JIT that targeted the frickin&#x27; TRANSPUTER.) For a while we were the de-facto standard Windows Mobile JVM. Even now there are still copies floating around.<p>But you can&#x27;t make money selling JVMs; the Sun licensing fees and the large team required for conformance testing soak up any margins. We were asked whether we wanted to become the standard Blu-Ray JVM. We said no --- we didn&#x27;t see how we could make any money at it. In hindsight that was probably a bad idea, because if we&#x27;d said yes then maybe someone would have cared about the company surviving.<p>C and C++ was supported, eventually; we had a gcc port which produced VP2. This was back in the gcc 2.95 days. I&#x27;m not sure you realise how horrible gcc 2.95 was, but it was very horrible. C wasn&#x27;t a good match to the intent way of doing things and we didn&#x27;t put as much effort into it than we should have; eventually we got traditional programming models complete with shared libraries and dlopen() but it was way too late to matter. Even right at the very end the vast bulk of the system was written in VP2 assembly.<p>We had a fling with Amiga pretty late on, and were the technology behind Amiga Anywhere, which nobody ever cared about. (Although we did actually get a few external users. The sheer novelty of this was hard to handle.)<p>If you actually want to get your hands on an intent development kit, there are some legal copies floating around: we bankrolled a short-lived &#x27;magazine&#x27; (read, advertisement) called Digital Magazine, and one issue had a complete PC dev kit on the cover CD.

The way it does this is make many decisions for you. If your workload don&#x27;t suit those decisions they may be sub-optimal. However the value is that your given limited sizing options, rather then having to decide amongst the millions of configuration options you would have with AWS or dedicated hosting. However you follow the Heroku documentation properly and you should be able to have a fairly performant solution.<p>Docker is containerisation. It allows you to run many containers on a single server. It can be configured in millions of ways, and part of a much larger stack. All it does is handles a small number of problems associated with running multiple applications on a single server (and the surrounding problem space). You can use whatever programming language / database / messaging stack / middleware / web server / etc you like, with the caveat that you need to either build the configuration (or use someones pre-configured image).<p>So the answer to your question really is why would someone need more flexibility then heroku offers, in which I can think of :<p>1.) Hosting outside of EU / US. Heroku does not have APAC / South America / African hosting at least according to documentation. <a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/regions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/regions</a><p>2.) Use of technology component not provided by Heroku. (Programming Language / Database / etc)<p>3.) Add-ons may not be suitable to provide key technology. (I really am uncomfortable with a Database being far away from application code, so a Database as a service makes me nervous, like Heroku Add ons). Heroku only provide Postgres and Redis.<p>4.) Each Application is a separate Heroku line item. A docker configuration could host thousands of rarely accessed applications. Outside of storage there is little resource costs for a rarely-used application.<p>5.) Ability to move. A docker container can be moved to anywhere. You want to host on Azure, you can. Rackspace offering something cheap, go there. AWS, your good. Get acquired and need to run in a corp VMWare environment... your good. Heroku apps tend to get tied into the platform as you deal with herokuisms and work around that environment.

When Walmart sells AA batteries as a loss leader, they don't get to not collect sales tax for it just because they used ""all the money gained [(and then some, out of their own pockets!)] for either shipping or purchasing the batteries"".<p>It gets really complex, in fact: the warranty replacement is only tax free if the warranty was a taxed line item during the original sale. If you make repairs to something, and you pass through the costs of the object to the person hiring you, you are generally considered to be a ""retailer"" and are responsible for collecting sales tax (which explains why you see wholesale discounts being given to large classes of professionals, from plumbers and carpenters to interior decorators).<p>That said, I am not claiming that the sales tax is the issue here: I'm claiming that this is a complex situation with a lot of intermingled laws and service terms, and that it is not at all clear that these people are running something that was entirely kosher and should de facto be supported.<p>People seem to have a thirst for PayPal's blood, and are totally ignoring (or, more favorably, simply not realizing due to lack of knowledge) that this was a somewhat sketchy, certainly risky (from a credit fraud perspective), and probably even illegal operation; and it makes no matter whether it involved feeding children or sick cats, or whether this is a computerized algorithm that flagged it or a person: the reason for the flagging, and for the blocks, actually makes a lot more sense when you examine the whole issue.",1323172390

The only reason this is okay (and we keep talking about Europe) is that the USA can print more money and Europe can't. Is this right?</i><p>Yes. The picture is even more stark when you look at Japan, where the government has more than 200% debt/GDP, but pays record low interest on bonds. Monetary sovereignty matters.<p>However, I wouldn't use the term ""print money"", simply because it clouds the issue. After all, you can also look at it this way: all the US government debt is money <i>that has already been ""printed""</i>. That view is essentially equivalent, because ""paying back"" a bond simply means transforming one government liability (the bond) into another government liability (reserves at the central bank). Whether that money is held in the form of paper, reserves at the central bank, or longer maturity bonds is unimportant.<p>What <i>is</i> important is that the private sector has already made it very clear that it does not intend to spend that huge amount of money any time soon, so for the purpose of analyzing what is actually happening in the economy the debt is irrelevant. After all, the debt is a <i>stock</i>, and what we're mostly interested in - things like GDP, or the payments that go towards employment - are <i>flows</i>.<p>Yes, there are interest payments. It is sobering to learn that a monetarily sovereign government chooses the interest rate that it pays on its liabilities. If the political will was there, the US government could just stop issuing interest-bearing bonds, and otherwise continue as usual.<p>Inflation, you worry? Well, the only first-order effect of such a move would be that the interest rate falls to zero. In theory, that could have a (very small) inflationary effect, but since the interest rate is <i>already</i> essentially zero, even that is unlikely to happen.",1323172051

For many cases paypal lives up to that (really quite amazing if you think about it) level of service. But the world is not a perfect place (nor is paypal of course) and a lot of people run into problems and their instinct is to blame paypal for both of those imperfections.<p>More so, people can use paypal without having any amount of experience with alternate payment processing methods, so they have no yard stick of comparison.

  Manhattan rejected the Securities and Exchange 
  Commissions proposed settlement with Citigroup because he 
  did not find it in the public interest, the agencys 
  chairwoman, Mary S. Schapiro, sought to enhance the 
  S.E.C.s authority to impose higher financial penalties to 
  deter securities violations. An important part of her 
  proposal would allow the S.E.C. to seek the increased 
  penalties in administrative proceedings, a move that may 
  allow the commission to avoid having to pursue its cases 
  in federal courts in the future, skirting the kind of 
  scrutiny Judge Rakoff applied.
</code></pre>
This article is a press hit[1] by the SEC's PR folk[2] which encourages people to call for stiffer penalties against those evil firms. Bingo, SEC gets a powerup. The ""grassroots"" outcry means they can now just ticket & fine companies without the meddling checks and balances of the federal courts system.<p>The SEC's fines have about as much to do with preventing a financial meltdown as local police traffic fines have to do with preventing a murder. It's just safety theater.<p>That is, everyone is familiar with the local/state government phenomenon of cops who ticket to make quota at the end of the month. Whether you are ""breaking the law"" today depends in large part on whether state/local government needs to make money off you. Tickets for expired registration are profit centers, robbery investigations are cost centers.<p>The federal government is subject to many of the same dynamics, except that it isn't called on the carpet in the same way because federal agencies can intimidate those with knowledge of the situation into silence. Once in a while data comes out on the corruption and malfeasance of (e.g.) FDA[3] or EPA[4] or SEC[5] bureaucrats, but for the most part they have the guns so they are dishing out the punishment.<p>The NYT's role in all this is to act as stenographer. There is no summary of how much the SEC sought to earn in fines from pursuing these prosecutions, nor how many of them were overturned or thrown out of court.<p>[0] <a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/12/05/s-e-c-seeks-more-power-but-does-it-need-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/12/05/s-e-c-seeks-more-powe...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/news/press.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/news/press.shtml</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fda-chemist-pleads-guilty-to-insider-trading/2011/10/18/gIQA6wwyuL_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fda-chemist-p...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.Blogs&ContentRecord_id=2197064b-802a-23ad-49a0-d86c2080b4f8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.B...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/sec-pornography-employees-spent-hours-surfing-porn-sites/story?id=10452544"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/sec-pornography-employees-spent-ho...</a>",1323171276

When an apprentice finished their apprenticeship, they would usually have to leave their master's service.  The openings for masters would be fixed per town by the guild, so journeymen would work itinerantly until they found an opening to become a master.  Journeymen would work for a series of masters, and their relationship to these masters was entirely different to the relationship of apprentices.<p>The status of journeyman became institutionalised, so that the criterion for taking up a mastership was that one had travelled widely enough as a journeyman for some length of time and had crafted a masterpiece.<p>I've never heard of the idea of guilds organising flights: I should think that master guildsmen had more to lose than agricultural laborers from relocation.

Europe has a handful of critical financial problems: shaky, heavily indebted banks; a massive debt burden; very little room to increase government spending; and an inability to actually regulate key aspects of the Eurozone economy (due to flaws in the nature of the laws backing the Euro). The EU in general is incapable of pulling even a hail mary bank bailout to stall for time. Add on top of this an even larger burden of state services (socialized medicine, pensions & retirement, welfare, etc.) that European politicians will have trouble downsizing to try to pay off the debt.<p>The US has a massive defense budget it could, in theory, trim substantially to bring the deficit under control, especially in concert with <i>slightly</i> reduced spending across the board and <i>slightly</i> increased taxes. The EU doesn't even have that option though, it's coming down to the wire and very little short of a miracle can save them.<p>Edit: note that the issue isn't paying down debt in the next few years, that's a fantasy for most of the world. The issue is keeping things together for the next few years to allow for long term effects like economic growth and inflation to really take care of the problem. For some parts of the EU there doesn't seem to be a way to make that happen.

2. know how to eat
3. know how to workout<p>Here, if you want to try fasting, which I do recommend, give this a shot. <a href=""http://www.leangains.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leangains.com/</a> or do the Warrior diet (one huge meal a day). A 16/8 fast is great. Heck, I sometimes even do an eat-stop-eat way and skip an entire day after I had a cheat day.<p>If you want to lose weight, it isn't about a crash diet, it most DEFINITELY is not about cardio and will never, ever be about low fat.<p>Here it is, in a nutshell, to lose weight and maintain decent muscle mass through life.<p>Eat whole foods in these categories only. 
Veggies, organic/grassfed meats (chicken, beef, fish etc), organic eggs. Some fruit (don't go nuts) and, only if you tolerate it, very little dairy.<p>Some rules: every meal has protein, no exceptions. Fat is your friend. Carbs from veggies and fruit only.<p>Now, exercise like this:
Hard, very, very hard. And short. Think lifting big weights in a complex manner like squats and deadlifts. If someone says you should be doing front shoulder raises, run.....<p>And sprint...bike REALLY fast for a short period of time, or jump rope really fast...something intense and short. Kettlebell swings in the 150-250 range would be great.<p>Do that a couple of days a week (2-3) there are awesome programs out there so don't think too much about this, rather just do it. 5x5 programs, strong lifts, or even the leangains guide has some.<p>There are awesome ways to get lost in details in all this, but that is like a 10 minute guide that I wish someone gave to me when I was 14. It literally took me this long to unlearn all the damage the high-carb, low-fat movement in the 80s did to us.",1323169653

This is while the entertainment industry (film, games, art, music) can shrink by 90% without causing much damage, are often considered less evil or even more important than those who provide the essentials.<p>I don't think the world has gone mad, I just think it's how the world is perceived from by different age groups.  When you are a teenager you think you'll never stop listening to the cool new music when you are older, but when you are older you realise the latest craze is cute but not that relevant.<p>On a different tangent, every year or two I have a look at what is happening in the open source world in the space that SAP operates in.  A few promising things pop up from time to time but never gets much traction, but it does seem to progress a bit over time, slowly.  I think the only thing that will move it forward is if universities put some projects behind it in their business and technology courses.",1323169215

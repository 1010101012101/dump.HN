58777,comment,58025,58771,0,0,ingenium,,,"The brain is composed of neurons. Each neuron either fires or it doesn't, just like on or off in a computer. This is determined by chemical reactions in and outside the cell. A powerful enough computer can simulate this down to the atomic level, it's just physics. Just because the computers we build don't function the same as the brain doesn't mean that the brain isn't a computer. Some attempts at AI have taken this approach, and while they generally work, we don't yet have the processing power to scale it. <p>When a certain stimulus happens, the effects it has on the brain, which include thoughts, is predictable and computable by doing the physics. We just have this illusion of ""free will"" and making choices. Our personalities are simply the result of how our brain's wiring developed from our environmental stimuli.<p>This also brings to light an important topic in philosophy of science: determinism. Is the world deterministic or not? If it's not, then physics and the sciences simply don't work. If the world is deterministic, which all evidence we have says that it is, then free will cannot exist. It's just easier and more comforting for people to pretend we have free will. ",1190615504

Instead of shooting rays back to a random point on a light surface though, you move the camera slightly (randomly) on the XY plane and shoot multiple rays per pixel.<p>Not only does this AA, but it also naturally offers depth of field blur.. The more you allow the camera to move with each ray, the more depth of field blur you get.<p>And then if you not only shoot rays from different camera locations, but also spread them out over time, AND you move objects in the scene, you get motion blur :). The greater the delta t you allow, the more motion blur you get.<p>Raytracing is really damn cool.. Too bad its still too performance intensive for real-time applications.",1190614509

All 7 reasons have almost nothing to do with ruby/rails:<p>#1 - ""is there anything rails/ruby can do that php can't do? ... (thinking)... no.""<p>#2 - our entire company's stuff was in php: don't underestimate integration<p>#3 - don't want what i don't need<p>#4 - it's small and fast<p>#5 - it's built to my tastes<p>#6 - i love sql<p>#7 - programming languages are like girlfriends: the new one is better because <i>you</i> are better\n",1190614445

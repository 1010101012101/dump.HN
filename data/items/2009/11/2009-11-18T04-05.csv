However, I guess this can be done by... for example, having parts of the board that open up as you get to higher scores.

I'll bet the machine you played Tribes and Wipeout on had a larger screen than an iPhone.  Compared to what more programmers experience on the desktops, the current crop of smart phones requires resource management in terms of CPU, memory, storage, and screen real estate.",1258519506
947788,comment,947614,947614,0,0,patio11,,,"I think people around here fall into a thinking trap regarding ""reviews"".<p>The average user <i>perceives no value</i> from the opportunity to review your application.  That sounds suspiciously like work!  They perceive value from <i>using</i> your application (one would hope, anyway).  I think folks here say ""I need folks to review my app"" because you think that that gets you ""You will, naturally, publish that review somewhere which is visible"", but this is sort of putting the cart ahead of the horse.  Get the use first and you will get the talking later, rather than the other way around.<p>(This is one place where TechCrunch et al distort our perception of reality.  TechCrunch et al will use any application just because it is new and shiny.  New and shiny iPhone-enabled social network for blind dog walkers?  Whatever, we'll give it 45 seconds just so we beat ReadWriteWeb to the first post about it!  Conversely, TechCrunch et al will <i>not</i> use an application just because it is old, despite the fact that it actually provides value to Actual People.  Actual People are not a constituency of TechCrunch et al.)<p>Bootstrapping your way into users isn't necessarily a fun place to be.  I really can't pound the organic SEO drum enough -- it is cheap and anyone can do it.  Write stuff which solves the problems of your target market.  Bonus points if the stuff you write recommends they try your app for more of the same pain relief.<p>Incidentally, SEOMoz has a few oldie but goodie articles about ""linkerati"".  Study carefully the factors which make content easy to consume and the factors which make content easy to recommend.  (They're not co-extant.  Content which is easy to consume but not easy to recommend, such as a lolcat picture, is not a high priority for you if you have no users.)  This should inform what sort of stuff you build to ramp folks up in the early day.  If it is too hard to recommend the trial because it takes hours of setup before you start seeing value from it, write a whitepaper.  If the whitepaper takes too long for the average customer to ""get"", condense it into a blog post.  Keep reducing the barriers to having your new best buddy in the world tell his friends/peers/readers about you.",1258519479

Some of the stuff he's talking about is fluff, and he's gotten some fair criticism over it - but he has some invaluable, very practical advice on automation of certain areas of a business, passive income streams, etc. Personally, I found it very helpful in moving from ""full time job, but want to start my own business"" stage to geting there and doing it full time.",1258518660
947773,comment,947417,947417,0,0,dasil003,,,"<i>There currently exists one botique manufacturer of pinball machines but its fair to say that innovation stopped in 1992.</i><p>I don't think that's fair to say at all.  Williams tried to save the Pinball industry by inventing the Pinball 2000 platform which had reflected video over the playfield.  It was definitely as big an innovative step as anything that cam before since the invention of the flipper.<p>Also, I might be biased having been 14 at the time, but I wouldn't call The Addams Family the end of innovation.  I would call it the beginning of maturity.  The machines Williams released in the 90s and the Stern machines of today reflect the perfection in pinball playability.  The precise shooting lanes and the deep rulesets gave rise to 15 years of amazing machines that are just as much fun for beginners as they are for experts.<p>It's a real shame the pinball machines are so expensive to maintain and thus so rare to find in good operating condition.  When I see my first real liquidity event I plan on purchasing some of my favorites (The Twilight Zone, The Addams Family, Attack From Mars, Indiana Jones, Simpsons Pinball Party, Lord of the Rings, Star Trek: TNG, Arabian Nights, Medieval Madness, etc)",1258518630

Which is to say, really awesome, if you're an eleven year old boy...but kind of dorky if you're a grownup with reasonably grownup taste.  While it was amazing to use a computer that looked like a scifi movie, the novelty wore off pretty quickly, and I switched back to WindowMaker, and eventually to various others (including a few tiling window managers, and Sawmill or Metacity).",1258518585

947767,comment,945504,945751,0,0,dasht,,,"Recoveries would (likely, for now - less likely a few years from now) be more often necessary and slower for most users all else being equal, but it's not that simple.<p>First, if users have software freedom and are running the system on servers under their own control, they are free to spend as much as they like, exactly how they like, to improve reliability.   That's the main point of $2^N analysis:   if Alice's Transnational Inc. stands to lose up to $500K on a given day if the service is out, she can buy insurance in terms of back-up servers (and her back-up servers only need to serve her users, not every user of the software, anywhere).   Alice is not limited to the same QoS as Bob's Main St. Paint Store.  37signals has to optimize its present and future profitability - not Alice's value received.  There's a misalignment of incentives, there.<p>Second, if the software were free and generally deployed in a distributed, decentralized fashion, it's architecture could evolve to be more of a P2P system such that many different servers would all have to go down at once to cause more than a slight inconvenience and performance degradation.",1258518092

This is also one of the few times I was surprised that more HN readers didn't poke holes in this blog post, but I think that's likely attributed to hacker ego in regard to ""marketing"" vs ""engineering"".<p>A few thousands visitors does NOT mean you're doing things right, in fact it <i>could be</i> reinforcing poor judgement and a bad product. I've seen this happen countless times by founders who didn't know when to stop drinking their own kool-aid and meaningfully evaluate product holes because a handful of visitors swore it was the best thing since slice bread.",1258517764

When I was first learning Linux back before the turn of the century, I found enlightenment to be the most cutting edge desktop environment I'd ever experienced. It has been quite a while since then, and desktop environments have come a long way. At this point, I'd be very surprised to see something disrupt the entrenchment of what have widely become widely accepted as the default environments across platforms. That being said, I am very curious to see what so much work has resulted in, so I'll be checking this out.",1258517607

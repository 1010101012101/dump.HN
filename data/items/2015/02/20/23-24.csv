It&#x27;s only kind of good for retention, and that only on HBO Go (and Amazon, now that it&#x27;s there too).<p>The competition for new subscriptions and paying that one more month always takes place in the present/future, or at least for content you haven&#x27;t watched yet which for any fan is going to be present/future.<p>And Netflix is kicking ass there, TBH. They have high-quality dramas, resurrected cult (and my!) favorites, the deal with Marvel, and probably half a dozen other things that got me salivating that I&#x27;m forgetting.<p>To be honest, I think Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are -all- schooling the old school providers in terms of interesting new content, HBO included. I love Six Feet Under, Mr. Show, and Deadwood as much as anyone, but aside from Silicon Valley and GoT, nothing else current excites me. At the very least, HBO needs to get much better at both making -and- fulfilling promises.",1424476791

But I&#x27;ll toss my opinion out there.<p>This is not unique to startups and/or founders.  Likeness is a contractually controllable commodity, e.g. using your image, reputation etc.  The catch 22 for you is that as long as the current team is not mis-representing your role or current activity, I think it may be tough for you to stop.  But I think you can likely get it stopped  if they are mis-representing your current level of involvement.  Think of it this way, it really would be no different then a company saying hey, Bill Gates was one of our co-founders, he left the company to pursue clean water but ya know he really gave us a good start.  I think that would be tough to stop, but I could be wrong.<p>I have had prior employers use my involvement with a project to prove to a new customer that the people who created the product had industry credibility.  Is that illegal?  I seriously doubt it, my bet is that they have the right to say that as long as they don&#x27;t mis-represent that I am still working the project.  I personally do not like that one employer did that, because I really did not believe in the updates they made to the product.  At the same time I did not pursue whether there was anything I could do about it.  I figured if anyone ever asked me, I&#x27;d just tell them the truth at that point. My bet is a lot of engineers have had this happen and just do not realize it.",1424476731
9083921,comment,9083606,9083870,0,0,justcommenting,,,"This particular issue has come up in previous HN discussions, but I would draw people&#x27;s attention to innocuous and quite reasonable-sounding phrases like &quot;need-to-know basis.&quot; What does that really mean for a company like Google, whose core business model fundamentally depends on extensively data-mining user information? &quot;Need-to-know&quot; could mean almost anything, or whatever Google wants it to mean. This is a classic Google privacy strategy: controlling the debate by defining the terms.<p>Despite a reassuring policy, you, as the website visitor, don&#x27;t get to decide these things and to the extent possible, the fact that this is even happening is abstracted away from most non-technical users.<p>Another example of Google&#x27;s brilliance in &#x27;controlling the debate by defining the terms&#x27;: policies like this cleverly (but wrongly) lead the reader to assume that cookies are the only way Google tracks users or correlates their activities. What about TLS-based tracking mechanisms, for example?<p>But this is a problem that&#x27;s bigger than Google. When information accumulates in distinct places, the value of exploiting that information always increases. Eavesdroppers naturally move to those places to exploit that information, sometimes with a legal backing (NSA/GCHQ) and sometimes without one (Aurora attacks, and other NSA/GCHQ activities).<p>Even if you interpret Google&#x27;s pronouncements charitably, it would be a mistake to assume that using the Google Fonts API can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t harm user privacy. Google is a massive target for essentially all eavesdroppers, and the Aurora attacks (and other breaches with lower profiles) show that the accumulation of information--even under reasonable-sounding terms like Google&#x27;s--can still end up in the wrong hands, and can be an inherently dangerous thing for user privacy.",1424476724

9083917,comment,9073917,9083464,0,0,yellowapple,,,"In theory, yes.<p>In practice, this tends to be a difficult problem to solve because most Linux environments are managed imperatively/procedurally rather than declaratively, meaning that in order to revert to a previous state, you have to be able to run the exact commands required to do so.  The traditional answer is to manage such a system with Puppet or Chef - thus allowing an administrator to tell the system <i>what</i> it should look like rather than <i>how</i> it should go about it - but that&#x27;s generally yet another layer of logical overhead to be considered.<p>NixOS - in theory, at least - addresses this more fully by integrating declarative configuration rather pervasively throughout the operating system itself, rather than trying to just add a layer on top of the operating system in order to manage it.  It relies heavily on the Nix package manager - instead of installing a program directly to the filesystem hierarchy, it installs it to an isolated folder named with a theoretically-unique hash, allowing multiple versions of the same program to coexist without conflicting (and allowing users to pick which version they want), making it painless to roll back software upgrades (just go back to a different selection of which package folders should be linked to, rather than having to manually remove and revert each package), etc.; NixOS leverages this package management system for <i>everything</i>, rather than just the software installed, and will create GRUB entries whenever you commit your configuration changes (by running `nixos-rebuild switch` or `nixos-rebuild boot`, causing an instant configuration switch or a configuration switch on next boot, respectively).<p>Other operating systems can hypothetically do this, too, and they&#x27;d end up looking similar to NixOS in terms of how things are organized and configured.  As I said, I think that&#x27;s probably the direction where most operating systems will eventually go.",1424476671

I&#x27;ve also configured Firefox to block cookies by default; only permitted sites can store cookies for the session, and just a handful I allow permanent cookies.<p>Web pages load much quicker, Firefox uses less resources, my browsing is significantly more secure (see [1] for risk of loading arbitrary fonts), and I can browse the web without Google/Facebook/AdvertizingCorp (and thus the Five Eyes) building a profile of everything I do.

No cookies are sent by website visitors to the Fonts API. Requests to the Google Fonts API are made to resource-specific domains, such as fonts.googleapis.com, googleusercontent.com, or gstatic.com, so that your requests for fonts are separate from and do not contain any credentials you send to google.com while using other Google services that are authenticated, such as Gmail.<p>In order to serve fonts as quickly and efficiently as possible with the fewest requests, we cache all requests made to our servers so that your browser only contacts us when it needs to.<p>Requests for CSS assets are cached for 1 day. This allows us to update a stylesheet to point to a new version of a font file when it’s updated. This ensures that all visitors to websites using fonts hosted by the Google Fonts API will see the latest fonts within 24 hours of their release.<p>The font files themselves are cached for one year, which is long enough that the entire web gets substantially faster: When millions of websites all link to the same fonts, they are cached after visiting the first website and appear instantly on all other subsequently visited sites. We do sometimes update font files to reduce their file size, increase coverage of languages, and improve the quality of their design. The result is that website visitors send very few requests to Google: we only see 1 CSS request per font family, per day, per browser.<p>We do log records of the CSS and the font file requests, and access to this data is on a need-to-know basis and kept secure. We keep aggregated usage numbers to track how popular font families are, and we publish these aggregates in the Google Fonts Analytics site. From the Google web crawl, we detect which websites are using Google Fonts, and publish this in the Google Fonts BigQuery database. To learn more about the information Google collects and how it is used and secured, see Google&#x27;s Privacy Policy.<p>For further technical discussion of how Google Fonts serves billions of fonts a day to make the web faster, see this earlier tech talk from the Google Developers YouTube channel.",1424475998
9083869,comment,9079861,9083073,0,0,geofft,,,"There&#x27;s nothing in the semver spec that allows bumping just the minor version for a backwards-incompatible API change because a change was a bugfix. The rules are:<p>> increment the MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,<p>> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and<p>> PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.<p>Minor versions aren&#x27;t for less-important API breaks. They&#x27;re for new functionality. If it breaks API, it&#x27;s a major version; if not, it&#x27;s a patch.<p>It is to semver&#x27;s credit that it doesn&#x27;t allow the maintainer any discretion here; many communities (like the Linux kernel community) have learned through experience that determining whether something is &quot;just&quot; a bugfix is impossible. Google for &#x27;don&#x27;t break userspace&#x27; and you&#x27;ll find Linus flaming people for changing <i>which error code</i> gets returned from certain operations. Semver&#x27;s rule is backwards-compatibility, which is a bright line: if the bug was that an interface didn&#x27;t work at all in some or all cases, or it returned unusable results, then that failure is not part of the API and it can be fixed. If it caused something to have worked <i>differently</i>, in ways that people could have written software to assume the &quot;wrong&quot; but workable behavior, then it&#x27;s part of the API.<p>It is not to semver&#x27;s credit that it doesn&#x27;t define the terms &quot;backwards-compatible&quot; or &quot;public API,&quot; but I think those terms have clear enough meanings in practice. In particular, anything documented and in use is part of the public API, even if the docs don&#x27;t match the actual behavior.<p>If a project really wants to say &quot;semver, but our docs define the API, not the implmentation&quot;, they can do that, assuming their docs are in fact thorough enough that you can write a correct program without having a copy of the implementation. But that&#x27;s also getting really close to &quot;semver, except when we don&#x27;t feel like it&quot;... which is probably what everyone does in practice.",1424475994

Mental complexity really comes with how much of the system you&#x27;re holding in your head at once. And with smaller repos you might be dealing with 10-20 repos on any given day, but that&#x27;s only 1-2% of our codebase/system. The other 98% is ignorable. So we end up holding less in our heads, assuming we&#x27;ve abstracted things correctly.<p>It did get annoying to deal with the mechanics of lots of repos. So we built tooling to make that easier. For example, CLI commands like &quot;goto analytics.js&quot; will clone and take us to the local copy of the repo. And &quot;publish patch&quot; handles all the mechanics of updating History.md from the git log, incrementing the version appropriately in package.json and component.json, tagging the commit and releasing to github and npm. Khaos, also mentioned in Sperandio&#x27;s article, helps us template out new repos quickly. With a few pieces of tooling like that you can move pretty fast across lots of repos.",1424475889

In other words, ask &quot;why is it important?&quot; and then formulate a plan from there. Eg., if it&#x27;s because you want to help the less-fortunate, go volunteer or go on a missions trip. Going to &quot;real&quot; school doesn&#x27;t count, because<p>2) schools are the epitome of segregation. Band kids over here. Drama kids over there. Jocks to the left, dorks to the right. Race A in this corner, race B in that corner. Watch any group of kids walking home after school and note the homogeneity. Part of that is because that&#x27;s how the kids naturally separate, and part of that is because<p>3) schools are populated by the kids who live in the neighborhoods they serve. Naturally, that population is not usually diverse. In the case that the neighborhood is ethnically diverse, it&#x27;s probably not economically diverse.<p>College is better, but people still tend to fall into groups of people who are like them in some way, whether it&#x27;s clubs, sports, Greek life, etc.",1424474352

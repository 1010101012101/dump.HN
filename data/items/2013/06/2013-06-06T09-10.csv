5831442,comment,5830993,5831346,4,0,regal,,,"Wikipedia cites numerous studies on heritability, showing that IQ starts off largely environmental (0.2 heritability at birth) but ends up eventually moving to what its been genetically predetermined to be (0.8 heritability in adulthood).[1] IQ seems to accurately measure abstract reasoning abilities, pattern recognition abilities, and memory retention. That's what most people think of when they say intelligence (though there are always efforts to ""redefine"" intelligence to make it a more politically correct / egalitarian term - at which point, you're not really talking about ""intelligence"" but rather ""semantics"" and how you want to define a word in the English lexicon).<p>The IQ ""debate"" reminds me very much of the race debate, that race ""doesn't exist"" and is purely a social construct with no genetic basis. I keep waiting for someone to take a black or Asian baby and place it with white parents for it to grow up and have white skin and a pointy nose and blond hair. So far I haven't seen it.<p>We have no trouble understanding that the differences between, say, a sheep and a cow are due to genetics; why is it so hard for us to wrap our minds around the fact that most of the differences between one another come down to genes, too?<p>Methinks it comes down to the old philosophical debate of free will vs. predetermination, and the innate fear many people have of the idea that you can do anything or be anything if you only work at it hard enough.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Heritability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Heritabi...</a>",1370512331

As far as I can tell nobody ( nobody I know) is thinking ""How can I make this easy ? "" Most of the tools these days are build around the same thought process. I will build a tool like Intellij but will add 2 extra features like cloud sync and another thing. But that is not what we need to do. That wont ""change the game"". Everytime we look at something and plan to disrupt it, we cant disrupt it by adding one more feature to a product that already exists. You need to think ground up. This also relates to people not thinking big. Its a hard problem. I understand that it is. But, someone has to go after the hard problems.

The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth."" -- Fyodor Dostoevsky<p>Would I rather be stupid and happy? No! And maybe I'm not of ""large intelligence"" in the first place, but I'm intelligent enough to often feel very disconnected and alienated from the society around me. I learned how to tell people what they want to hear, but inside I often feel like I'm trapped in some kind of zoo. The heat death of the universe is the only grown up thing I actually get to deal with, and I get to deal with it alone, while most everybody else is either drunk on brain chemistry or not playing in that league. I feel like I'm sitting in some kind of waiting room where there is nothing to do. If it wasn't for things like music, dancing, cats, dogs and toddlers, there is no way I would have made it this far. Flowers and sparrows nourish me, people are a chore. Capitalism? Don't even get me started, unless you're willing to give me an army with which to solve the issue.<p>And now I'm going to completely contradict myself and say that intelligence is like the horse power of an engine; yeah, it matters, you cannot go anywhere without an engine, and you can't go fast or far with a crappy one. BUT what might matter even more is the steering wheel, and I totally suck at using that. I speed around a lot and end up in ditches, and I think there is something to the ""saying"" that more intelligence makes bigger mistakes possible; I am a living example of that.<p>I know I am just whining. My personal inability to enjoy life and other people doesn't have to mean intelligence isn't generally positive; but still, when it comes to society and living and working together, it's all rather relative, and being too smart or too stupid both can easily lead to inefficiencies and heartache. Humanity as a whole might have better outcomes if it was more intelligent as a whole, but individuals being too far ahead cannot do much other than acknowledge all the beautiful things that could and should be but never will.<p>That said, I would never ever want to swap.

Some of that may be my attention deficit and the effort I have had to put in to being successful despite it.  I think the problem though is different, however.  I am going to say two things:<p>1.  Intelligence is not definable to the point where it can be tested, and<p>2.  Attitude > innate intelligence.<p>I expect both these will not be so welcome in the HN community as such, so I am prepared for downvotes, but I also dont think these are wrong either.<p>On the first, the fact is that people process information differently.  Ramanujan processes a number a certain way.  Someone else might associate it with a year and immediately make historical connections.  Someone else may factor get fascinated and factor it.  There are bunches of ways a piece of information can be processed and the weighing of one as better than another is ultimately a cultural judgement and ultimately what proves to be an interesting property depends on what we find fascinating (which brings me to my second point).<p>On the second, I have found all my life that the smartest people I have known have always been the most humble, and to regard everyone else as being worthy of learning from.<p>I have consequently come to regard intelligence as a two-fold habit.  The first part is the habit of finding everything interesting in life, what I call an unwillingness to be bored (something that really comes through in Feynman's memoires).  The second is regarding everyone as someone to learn from (Heisenberg btw comes across this way very much in ""Physics and Philosophy"").

As a developer.
I've been told it's normal, and nobody seems to be alarmed.<p>But that's not the worst thing. People actually enjoy it, if you listen to some, they found the perfect ""job""!

One need only read Mensa magazine to realise that IQ does not constitute intelligence in a meaningful sense.<p>It's clear that brains vary, of course, but 'intelligence' is too broad a term to say, quantitatively, to what degree a person possesses it. The term encompasses:<p>- The ability to acquire new knowledge quickly, or to learn difficult things at all.<p>- The ability to, given time, make nontrivial deductions from given data.<p>- The ability to make rapid deductions in short periods of time about given data.<p>- The ability to generate multiple unrelated solutions to a problem.<p>- A high level of verbal proficiency.<p>We mean all these things to different degrees at different times when we use the term; and although these are not orthogonal concepts, they clearly do not exist in a one-dimensional space.<p>Certainly if IQ is taken to mean 'the raw, unchanging potential of a mind', the Flynn effect is inexplicable given that the timescales involved are far too small for our neurobiology to have adapted evolutionarily. Given that it means very little other than 'the ability to pass IQ tests', the Flynn effect is perhaps not surprising at all.",1370509796

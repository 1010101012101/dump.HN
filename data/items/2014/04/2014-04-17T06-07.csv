I just went to a source of physical (quantum) randomness <a href=""http://www.randomnumbers.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randomnumbers.info/</a> and I&#x27;m giving you a random number between 0 and 10,000 which I&#x27;ve just generated there. Here it goes: 6296.<p>Ok. Now that light cone had finally reached you. And you (neurons in your brain to be precise) are thoughtfully entangled with that random event (outcome), now in your past.<p>Now imagine the following. A few days passes.  And you forget that number. A few years passes. Connections between the neurons which were storing this information are now gone. Molecules and atoms which were part of these neurons are gone from your body. There are no entanglements any more which link you to that event.  Is that event in your future now? Again?",1397717974

Each turn, a participant may change a rule.  The game ends when a player wins, but players can also change those win conditions.<p>Surprisingly, some googling doesn&#x27;t turn up very much, and I figured an HN post would be more valuable anyway.<p>It&#x27;s amusing to think about trying to get a game going via this HN post.  Each comment subtree would become its own strange little game.  It&#x27;d never work; chaos would ensue.  Amusing chaos.  Probably best not to do that though.<p>Anyway, does anyone remember this game?  What was it called?",1397717953

The reason why the table is easier to read than the sentence is the spatial semantic grouping of variables. You scan the first column, see the monotonically increasing time, then can directly interpret the numbers in the second column. In the sentence, you have to filter out a lot of chaff before you can understand (or confirm) the basic pattern in the independent variable. They also mixed up the order of the items in the sentence, making for more &#x27;chaff&#x27; obscuring analysis It&#x27;s not about &#x27;familiarity&#x27;, but the ease of pulling related information - if the sentence was ordered but the table unordered, then depending on the data, the sentence could be easier to interpret, for example.<p>The second table is unconventional - it is ordered by the independent variable, but it leads with the dependent variable. If we had the convention of putting the independent variable on the right, this table would be perfectly familiar and readable. The rationale isn&#x27;t &quot;the important information is the temperature&quot;, as the article says, but that the table is ordered by the independent variable - we need to know what it is and how it behaves, then we can more easily the relation of the independent variable against it.",1397717676

Maybe you can help me out.<p>1) What does it mean that entangled particles are supercorrelated? How can S(A|B) = 2 or -1?<p>2) The formula for Von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(p log(p)), where p is the density matrix. How do you take a log of a matrix?<p>3) Why does the interpretation rely on the density matrix? I&#x27;ve always thought of the density matrix as something that gives information about our ignorance rather than the system (this is why the density matrix mixes classical probabilities in alongside quantum amplitudes/probabilities - observer uncertainty is classical). Therefore, to me, any good interpretation of quantum mechanics ought to work without density matrices.<p>Unfortunately his paper here (<a href=""http://www.flownet.com/ron/QM.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flownet.com/ron/QM.pdf</a>) doens&#x27;t seem to have significantly more information than his talk.<p>Thanks for any help you can offer.",1397717346

Entanglement <i>does</i> however, explain why systems tend to equilibrium rather than any other type of state as it evolves <i>forward</i> in time.<p>On a related note, I found this quote interesting. It reminds me of how HN comments about quantum information theory has a tendency to get downvoted:<p>> The idea, presented in his 1988 doctoral thesis, fell on deaf ears. When he submitted it to a journal, he was told that there was “no physics in this paper.” Quantum information theory “was profoundly unpopular” at the time, Lloyd said, and questions about time’s arrow “were for crackpots and Nobel laureates who have gone soft in the head.” he remembers one physicist telling him.",1397716107

9938121,comment,9937251,9937826,0,0,dshankar,,,"Many technologies exist to achieve this, they&#x27;re just not in the &quot;consumer ready&quot; stage yet.<p>3D scanning is best for static objects like walls in your room. They never move or change, so scan the whole space. When you turn your head in VR, you&#x27;ll see accurate 3D representations of that 3D environment.<p>Full 6DOF tracking is another method. Given a 3D scanned static object, like a coffee cup, you can track it using various optical and IMU-based techniques. This means a static object can be dynamically tracked as it moves, giving you accurate information about the 3D world to pick up your coffee cup without spilling it.<p>Optical tracking can be used to replicate facial movements into 3D models (see: Faceshift), to track finger movements (see: LeapMotion/Kinect), or full body motion.<p>Video can fill in the gaps for dynamic content. This can be achieved in two ways: 
1) depth cameras which combine RGB video like a normal camera with depth information, allow us to reconstruct dynamic objects at proper depth.
2) 360-degree stereoscopic video which gives a fixed perspective to the full 3D environment. This isn&#x27;t great for &quot;3D from all angles&quot; as non-rotational head movements won&#x27;t see an accurate view.<p>A combination of these technologies will enable a VR user to see a real 3D environment, and feel like they are in it.<p>One thing is certain: it&#x27;s coming. It&#x27;s just a matter of time. The technology is rapidly maturing.",1437681576

Figure out who will be the one paying for your service. Is it the company? The talented individuals? Recruiting firms?<p>Companies approach recruiting with the fixed mindset because there is a job that needs to be completed and they want to minimize their risk/cost so they hire someone who has done it before.<p>As JSeymourATL mentioned, you&#x27;re going to have to educate a lot of folks on why the growth mindset is a better alternative than the fixed mindset. In theory it&#x27;s great but you&#x27;ll need proof that it&#x27;s better for the company and by better, either it saves them money or makes them more money.

Or, there also might be a &quot;file first and ask questions later policy&quot; for many companies, so that valuable inventions are captured along with the junk patents, a bycatch of sorts. Then, the company can enhance their reputation in some communities by giving away patent rights. Second, the purpose of patents is to exclude others from making your invention for a period of time in exchange for teaching the invention to the public. This can be useful for smaller players, including individual inventors, who do not have a large market share and comparatively little money.

9937997,comment,9935471,9937745,0,0,jtuchsen,,,"Is his entire complaint that the syntax looks too much like Java? The fact is, people are already using prototypes to share common methods across objects, and classes are really nice short syntactic sugar for doing that. His comment on classes there is too flippant to even know the meaning of his complaint.<p>Beyond that I&#x27;d argue that classes give you more guarantees about how an object will behave at the expense of flexibility, although they give you escape hatches if you like. The reduced flexibility is really nice because you can define safe subsets of the language in which tools that analyze and refactor code are possible, even across files if you&#x27;re using the module system. Moving the language in a direction where consistent universal tooling is possible to write is something that I love about classes, and is often overlooked in discussions about it. I don&#x27;t care that classes are just a simplified subset feature of what&#x27;s possible using prototypes, it covers the common case well enough and makes it possible to write really nice code completetion and refactoring tools that don&#x27;t randomly break. That&#x27;s worth all the extra magic in my opinion.",1437680548

This also requires that the planet be somewhat edge-on, but the requirement isn&#x27;t nearly as strict as with the transit method.  The difficulty is that Earth size planets have very little mass, and so impart a very small wobble to the star, on the order of only ~10 cm / s.<p>In the second method, you just try to block as much light from the star as you can and go look for the reflected light of the planet.

Specifically to enable you to perform analysis on large datasets, directly from your local machine. More generally, Treasure Data enables the collection, storage & analytics of large-scale event data.<p>For performing preliminary analytics, I’ll agree with what the previous respondents have said - iPython Notebook is a GREAT tool. It’s certainly my go to. The libraries I think of using when working within this context are as follows:<p>The go-to packages:

> <a href=""http://bokeh.pydata.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bokeh.pydata.org/</a><p>Of course, the challenge is you don’t have a static dataset! New data is continuously coming in. Your dataset is growling larger all the time. It may be too large to fit on your local machine.<p>That’s why Treasure Data was founded, to enable the easy collection of, and analytics on, this type of data stream. Treasure enables complete removal of the engineering & devops for these collection & storage steps.<p>For example:
> Want a continuously updated dashboard of your incoming data? = Treasure Data + Jupiter Notebooks + Pyxley
> Want to perform graph visualizations on event data? = Treasure Data + Jupiter Notebooks + Neo4J
> Want to create visualizations in R? = Treasure Data + R + ggplot<p>The above is enabled through Treasure Data’s integration with Pandas & R.

For instance, they&#x27;re useful in quantum mechanics for simplifying the schroedinger eq (sometimes from a second order diff eq to a first order one) by changing from a position basis to a momentum basis, in effect rewriting your derivatives from a different point of view.",1437679041

A great use case for these macros (especially in the browser) is in dealing with those god-awful deprecation warnings any given big-enough framework will eventually start spitting out after enough usage.<p>Right now, framework developers use console.warn which, as a function, is usually buried in the framework, and so gives stack-traces that are entirely useless to a developer using said framework (especially if the framework wraps console.warn in some way). A good clean way of declaring macros will allow JS frameworks to not be cancerous to maintain by making the stack-trace for deprecated user-code very easy to spot and correct.<p>And unlike features such as classes, generators, symbols, and even TCO that are reasonably achievable through clever engineering, macros flat-out have to be special-formed in.

There are infinite meeting rooms that can be accessed effortlessly. Everyone gets a private office when they want it.<p>Communicating with loved ones changes too. Why catch up on the phone when you can sit in a living room with them?<p>Virtual reality is not a niche pursuit.",1437678156

It&#x27;s possibly one one the widest-spread legal myths.<p>An acquaintance of mine is a state prosecutor, and he&#x27;s always amused about this. IIRC it goes so far that when he requests information from a bank employee, he usually directly tells him to ask his in-house legal counsel if he&#x27;s allowed to withhold information.<p>What really existed and was softened quite a bit was &quot;tax secrecy&quot;. The tax agency was not allowed to freely peek into your accounts. But criminal investigators always could.<p>About the CDU: having a party for Christians is in no way against the seperation of church and state. Actually it&#x27;s the other way around: if Christians were not allowed to form parties (or name them as such), it would amount to state-sponsored discrimination against Christians and endorsement of everyone else.<p>The government collects the &quot;church tax&quot;, but neither creates it, nor keeps it. The churches themselves decide if and how much to &quot;tax&quot;, and they pay the state for the collection service.<p>The rest of your anti-Christian rant is also pretty much baseless, but not easily refuted with a single sentence.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t want to seem to pick on you too much; I liked the rest of your comment and upvoted it (which doesn&#x27;t matter since I replied afterwards).",1437678131

In a sense you are both correct, since Japanese kanji have both a ""Japanese"" and ""Chinese"" reading, and I believe the same is (or was) true for Korean hanja.  In both cases ""literacy"" was nearly synonymous with ""literacy in Chinese"" in Japan and Korea for quite a long time, during which those languages adopted thousands of Chinese words.  (Part of the resistance against other writing systems, including simpler phonetic ones, in Japan and Korea came from the assumption that any serious person would aspire to Chinese literacy, and a simpler writing system that was not a door to Chinese would only be of use to ""stupid people"" and women -- people who did not aspire to full literacy.)<p>Even today the distinction between ""Japanese"" and ""Chinese"" readings is used when teaching Kanji, and Koreans are much more commonly aware of the distinction between words of Chinese and native Korean etymology than English speakers are aware, say, of the distinction between words of Romantic and Germanic origin.",1274507974

1369864,comment,1368423,1368905,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I'm sorry, cite your evidence please. Humans have never 'died young', it's complete bullshit, our life expectancy has changed <i>not</i> our longevity. Genghis Khan died at 65 in 1227. Julius Caesar was <i>murdered</i> at 56 years old in perfect health in 44BC. Augustus died at 77 in 14AD. Ramesses The Great is believed to have died between 90-93 years old, in 1213BC.<p>I'm sorry, that's 3000+ years where we know our longevity hasn't changed, especially considering all of these men entered warfare. People living to 100 with all their mental and physical strength is rare, however people living to their 60's is not and has never been.<p>Our genes evolved to fight childhood diseases and injuries, so that those who make it through have the potential to live well into their 60's without a problem. Incidentally, those who get sick less frequently in childhood tend to have a longer lifespan as is. However the whole notion that humans only lived till 30 is absurd, because it's simply not true for any of recorded history. Yes it was the average, however that was under a very different culture.<p>Ramesses II successor was his 13th son, who lived to his early 80's. Many of his other children either died very early or died through injury or mid-life disease. His first born for instance died from a blow to the head in his 40's.<p>Please, don't confuse life expectancy and longevity, the two are vastly different. The former has changed drastically, the latter hasn't. Regardless of whether we avoid disease today or 3000 years ago, we'll likely hit 90 years before dying of old age 'naturally' (IE from a <i>lack</i> of longevity).",1274507533

It'd be really interesting if you could put up some anonymized statistics about the 207 startups from the perspective of the founders. I'd visualize it as a series of images for each quarter, with a grid of venn diagrams of none/dead/acquired/funded/profitable for each YC round up to that point. Put it in a slideshow so you can scrub back and forth in history. Would also work in table form with YC rounds on one axis and time (or time since YC) on the other.

1369857,comment,1369208,1369208,0,0,zach,,,"Okay, so it's a very convenient parametrization to limit the search to a low character length.  That way you can score a six-letter domain name, which is bragable.  But I think this is a premature optimization.<p>Hackers (in particular) get hung up on minimizing characters, which is not at all the most important business function of your domain name.  Never have I gone to type a long domain name, only to give up halfway through to instead visit a shorter-named alternative, a la Porky Pig.<p>Domain naming should instead seek to increase memorability, enable verbal communication of the name, strike a proper emotional tone, and avoid spelling ambiguities.  If that happens to result in a ten-letter domain name, you know what?  It's okay.  Nobody cares how short your name is if they've forgotten it.<p>It occurs to me that to increase memorability, we should take a cue from mnemonics.  People tend to be squeamish about mnemonic devices.  Have you heard of these memory competitions where people memorize the order of a deck of cards?  You would think that the people with superhuman memories have no need for ""silly tricks"" like visualizing animals instead of numbers, but in fact it's the effective use of those techniques that helps them memorize far better than the average fellow.  The point is that some things are practically always more memorable.<p>In particular, concrete nouns, sensory adjectives, visceral actions and terms relevant and descriptive to the subject are inherently more memorable than abstract, generic, irrelevant or nonsensical words.  Words that are harder to memorize accurately are also more easily misremembered for synonyms or similar-sounding words.<p>Finally, when you have a mnemonic device in your domain name, reinforce it.  I would never have remembered Silverback if it wasn't for that darned cute gorilla.  Even if I couldn't remember the exact name, it's the first result on Google for ""gorilla app,"" which points out another advantage of their naming strategy.<p>I'm interested in what websites people can never remember.  My hypothesis is that their names would mostly be very anti-mnemonic in nature.",1274507106

1369840,comment,1369687,1369829,0,0,carbocation,,,"The problem is not that the kits cannot accurately read off your DNA; they do an admirable job of that. The problem is that our knowledge of the impact of any particular allele is exceedingly incomplete.<p>Without a clinical trial validating these tools, most of us in the field find it to be inappropriate to advise someone as to their risk profile on the basis of direct-to-public kits. (I'm not talking about the BRCA tests or other validated, gene-specific tests - I'm talking about 23andMe-style genome-wide kits.)<p>Particularly for complex (polygenic) traits, these throw you into a minefield. Consider two modes of error: (1) The test indicates impending illness. (2) The test indicates no impending illness / good longevity. For (1), imagine that you have a disease-predisposing allele that the kit catches, which is why it thinks you'll be sick. But it doesn't catch (since these kits only target 1/10,000th of the genome) some other allele that protects you from the same disease. So you inappropriately worry about the disease. If disease risk is modifiable by behavior (such as exercise), perhaps it encourages you to work out more often. But, perhaps it will make you feel like you cannot overcome your genetic destiny, so you don't work out at all. The prophecy would then be self-fulfilling.<p>For (2), imagine that the testing kit sees that you have a few protective alleles for disease X - but you also have a novel mutation that is private to your family and not found in the general population. The testing company has no idea that this exists, and it obviously won't be on these testing kits (which overwhelmingly track common, not rare, variants). So now you end up getting disease X a few years down the road, despite all evidence from the kit suggesting that you'd never get it.<p>These are my two favorite failure modes, though there are plenty of others. At the end of the day, although I'm in the field of human genetics, I'm not going to be advising people to get these kits until there are clinical trials validating specific risk predictions. (I'm not saying <i>not</i> to use the kits - but I am saying that it's going to be more for fun than for accurate medical prediction. For now.)",1274505689

1369838,comment,1368423,1369304,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Perfect use of the COCP lands your odd of getting pregnant at 0.3% in a year. However typical use lands you at about 8% (condom is 10-18% of typical use) risk, meaning you're doing good if you get a decade without getting pregnant (on average).<p>An indefinite lifespan will change the world ridiculously, however you're completely ignoring human nature. Those who take risks tend to be the ones who reproduce the most, and assuming fertility remains sustainable throughout life, those risk-averse will be quickly out bred. However, even considering the considered longevity of frozen sperm and embryos (women can still carry a child post-menopausal through egg donation - incidentally same odds as a younger woman).<p>You're considering risk aversion as the winner, when in reality it will be those who procreate frequently. If a couple produces 2 kids roughly every 20 years, that's 100 children they will produce meaning the risk averse will have to last 100,000 years just to <i>match</i> the genes of those who reproduce if their offspring never reproduce. Assuming a predisposition to reproducing at 20 (I've known all too many people with 4-generations of teenage mothers in their family, so it's certainly not an absurd prospect) and each two children produce two children in 20 years, you'd hit 1 peta-offspring by the 1000 year mark.<p>Your risk-averse would be marginally existent, similar to a dust mite next to an elephant.

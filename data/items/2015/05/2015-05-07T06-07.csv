Put the devices on top of each other on the ground. This is your fixed point (wathever gps reading their each have, is &quot;local zero&quot;).<p>Now pick one up. The one on the ground is your fixed point, the other unit is what you use for measuring. I wonder if doing it like that (possibly with two or three &quot;anchors&quot;) -- would give increased precision? I haven&#x27;t really looked in to what makes cheap gps &quot;unreliable&quot;.<p>The units could communicate via bluetooth/mesh wifi for low latency, or over the internet (wifi/gprs/4g/dial-up...) -- if one just needed &quot;point-to-point&quot; measurements. Eg measuring a foundation or something related for construction.<p>I wonder if it would be &quot;repeatable&quot; (possibly only with the same units). And if one might get cm precision that way.<p>[ed: Not sure which part is &quot;hard&quot;. Maybe (just for science experiment fun) one could drop a phone at one end of a 100m running track, an another at the other end - to get an exact 100m baseline (+/- 10cm?). I wonder if that might be useful in order to calibrate two or more units to work in pairs -- if there is some kind of predicable source of error in addition to just gps/signal noise etc].",1430981968

Low-power testing is good to have e.g. for mobile applications, but it doesn&#x27;t increase the capabilities of our algorithms. What we need to advance the field is faster training of larger nets. That&#x27;s where the really interesting applications will be discovered.<p>A convnet-optimized chip could clearly be much faster and more power efficient than a convnet running on a CPU or GPU. The move from CPU to GPU brought a 10x speedup already, but GPUs are hardly ideal for running convnets. For one thing, they have tons of graphics-specific hardware that&#x27;s useless for convnets and could just be deleted in a convnet chip. For another, GPUs are much more flexible than necessary for convnets. The main operation you need to perform is convolution and you could make fixed-function convolution units that would be much more power and area efficient than generalized GPU shader cores. For yet another thing, there&#x27;s no reason to believe that 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point is the best power/precision tradeoff for convnets. I&#x27;m willing to bet that you could go much lower.

I haven&#x27;t interviewed with them but I can go thru my normal job hunt process.<p>This may sound harsh but I consider applying for a job to be a serious process.  I know companies seem to take candidates for granted a lot, and there&#x27;s a lot of emphasis on weeding out bad hires.... but how many people think about the fact that you&#x27;re going into a situation where they ask you questions, don&#x27;t give you much time to learn about them, and then expect you to be there for 3 or more years?<p>I care about my life and I don&#x27;t want to waste 3 or more years in a bad situation, because it does lasting damage to your resume.  So, you have to be very perceptive, and look closely at the information you do get.  Based on this experiment (what I will write up below) I would never even apply to AirBnB because the indications are they are not a good place to work.<p>You&#x27;re right that good recruiting is a competitive advantage, but it seems like AirBnB doesn&#x27;t have it. And I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s because the corporate culture is too arrogant... anywhere here&#x27;s my notes upon evaluating AirBnB as a place to apply:<p>=================<p>-  First off, their jobs page is full of HR BS, it&#x27;s not genuine at all, it comes off as completely fake.  By genuine, I mean relatable to a potential employee. And by fake I mean written by an HR person in vague generalities that don&#x27;t really mean anything. This is a strong indicator that the culture may really suck hard.  Example, BS like this:  &quot;Everyone is creative. Think scary big. Volunteer for impossible situations. Get shit done.&quot;  Volunteer for impossible situations? So, you want me to set myself up for failure?  Cause I&#x27;m a ninja, right?  Words do have meanings.<p>-  No remote engineering positions.  Most of their jobs are in the bay area.  Two strikes indicating a lack of care for their employees.  Working in the bay area is about %250 as expensive as living elsewhere (I did a comparison to Austin and when cost of living (which is high in Austin) and additional taxes in california are added, then I would have needed a %150 pay raise to have the same take home pay-- and the salaries being offered in california are not that high.)  Your 500th engineer does not need to be in california.<p>-  Their job listing page for a job highly relevant to me-- pretty good.  The listing is very polished but more genuine than the jobs page. No &quot;ninja&quot; but they do fall into &quot;We want someone who is great at X but also not-X and this other unrelated not-X as well.&quot;  For values of X and not-X that are kinda mutually exclusive (yes, you could be a designer who codes but you&#x27;re going to be more one or the other not really both, and certainly not all three. Pick one.)  They bragged about doing something where they literally did a half assed job.  EG: &quot;We&#x27;ve done X a lot, in fact we&#x27;ve done it Y times!&quot; Where Y is half of what it should be for a proper professional solution.<p>- Benefits:  What&#x27;s a &quot;employee travel coupon&quot; They should explain it.  Also, if you&#x27;re going to make me drag my butt into your office every day, at least give me a standing desk, preferably motor operated. At home I can just work out whenever I want.<p>-- Looks like an open office plan. When you&#x27;re at that level of operations you should give engineers the option of a 1 or 2 person office, and make it clear on your recruiting site.  If you don&#x27;t offer this, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>I haven&#x27;t interviewed with them, so here&#x27;s my review of recent (Eg this year) reviews on Glassdoor:<p>-- Bad technical interview, using a clearly inappropriate technical question (Eg: let&#x27;s entertain ourselves by watching the candidate squirm, and get an ego boost as well for knowing the answer.)<p>-- Yeah, this one I&#x27;ll just quote:
&quot;This was one bad experience. I have interviewed at many places- big and small companies and experience at AirBnb is easily the worst. I applied online and HR called to schedule a phone interview. We went back and forth and they could not interview on the dates I had provided. I was going to be in SF for something else the next week and they suggested that I come onsite directly for onsite interviews as the phone interview dates were not working out. So I extended my stay (my own expenses as I am not a local candidate) and got ready for onsite interviews. When I went there, and asked for the agenda - the HR tells me - that its going to be just 1 interview - similar to a phone interview except that its going to be in person. I was shocked. I showed them the email where they confirmed me for onsite and they simply stated it was a communication mishap. This costed me heavily in terms of time and money. The HR seemed very careless and inefficient.<p>As for the interview, the interviewer asked me a Dynamic Programming question (hard one) and said - he didn&#x27;t care how I implemented it but just wanted a working code in 30 mins. I tried and was very close to the solution. I had a minor bug in the base case of my recursion. The interviewer just stood up at the 30 min mark and left abruptly. I came out and quickly tried the solution in my laptop. I was able to complete it and get it working in another 5 mins. But from the looks of it, there is no credit for implementation idea, thought process or any such thing.<p>Overall, very negative experience.&quot;<p>Sounds very much like the experience from several years ago posted elsewhere in this thread.<p>BTW, if you&#x27;re just looking for working code and you&#x27;re not caring about the candidates thought process, you fail, and you should be fired from interviewing on the spot.  Multiple of the reviews mentioned this, so clearly this is a pattern which makes me think it&#x27;s a policy!  That&#x27;s kinda astounding!<p>Yeah, it just continues from there, bad experience after bad experience:<p>&quot;Recruiters at Airbnb are the most unprofessional bunch of people. They don&#x27;t reply to emails for weeks and don&#x27;t attend you during onsite. In my onsite, one interviewer didn&#x27;t come to interview room on time, the other was busy doing her work after giving me a question. I have interviewed at big/small all kind of companies, have offers from them but this was the worst experience so far. All my respect for the company gone down in drain.
They publicize their &quot;core values&quot; so much, one of which is &quot;Be a host.&quot; They were the worst host an interview candidate can get.&quot;<p>More than enough negative reviews and more importantly indications of bad arbitrary interview process in the positive reviews as well to tell me to stay away.",1430979397

For example, it assumes that the marketplace is free and fair, which it clearly is not.

Also, profiting from others&#x27; suffering is wrong.<p>Finally, our economic system, while good relative to most in human history, could be greatly improved.

GPS satellites broadcast their position by transmitting ephemeris parameters. You can compare the accuracy of these parameters with post-processed, high accuracy orbits from igs.org. For the last few months, the real-time ephemeris has had an RMS error of about 0.5 meters (95 percentile is about 1.3 meters). (This is the range error, which includes both satellite position error and satellite clock error)<p>Of course, these errors cancel out if you&#x27;re doing differential GPS techniques. (Where all that matters is accuracy relative to the base station)<p>One thing that would be nice is to access IGS&#x27;s real-time streaming orbit data over the internet and have the phone&#x27;s GNSS chipset use that instead of the broadcast ephemeris. However, you might still want dGPS for single frequency receivers to help with ionospheric error.",1430978599

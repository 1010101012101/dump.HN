Got a mental image?  OK.<p>Did you think that there was enough of a market for one firm to make $30,000 in sales?

Seriously, tea is a multi-billion dollar industry.  Of course its going to be big enough to support an extra person or three.  The surprising bit is that, at Internet scales, businesses you would <i>never</i> have expected to be viable are big enough, too.<p>My personal favorite Internet anecdote, from the Dot Com days: there exists a farm which sells tumbleweed.  Because if you need tumbleweed, and who doesn't, where are you going to get it?  A tumbleweed farm, of course.  Most of the Dot Coms have since Dot Bombed, but the Prairie Tumbleweed Farm is still going strong.  The address is, naturally, <a href=""http://www.prairietumbleweedfarm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prairietumbleweedfarm.com/</a> .<p>My favorite Japanese Tex-Mex place is a little shop in Gifu City called El Paso.  They have tumbleweed, for the authentic Tex Mex feel.  Stop laughing, the owner thought it was important to look the part.  And where did they get their tumbleweed?  Well, where would YOU get your tumbleweed -- they went to the acknowledged Tumbleweed experts at the Prairie Tumbleweed Farm.  Which, helpfully, has pages in Japanese because El Paso is far from the only Japanese establishment that craves the authentic Western look.",1228885164

392485,comment,392368,392368,0,0,jderick,,,"To clarify the title, all 50000 people were working as a team in a single game of chess.<p>I originally thought this would be a pointless exercise, sort of like 50000 monkeys banging away at typewriters.  It appears that was not the case.  I found this passage about how one of the players effectively lead the team quite fascinating:<p>""15...Ra8<p>The results of the vote were a reflection of the increasing coordination of the World Team. Krush was maintaining an analysis tree, and continually updating with all the suggestions and refutations from the bulletin board. Not only did the analysis tree allow the World Team to work with less duplication of effort, it served as a standing, detailed argument for the correctness of the recommended move.""<p>It makes sense that some kind of unified document to keep track of everything would help.  It is fascinating to me how much like the data structure you would probably see inside a computer chess program this document resembled.<p>Next, in the commentary for move 16:<p>""This sparked loud grumbling on the bulletin board that Krush had ""taken over the game"". Those who complained were not overstating Krush's influence; her recommendations were selected every single move from the 10th to the 50th.""<p>This was really surprising to me, how much influence her recommendations had after that point.  I wonder how much of it was: first mover advantage vs form of coordination vs having the best ideas.",1228884109

I have a reasonably recent MacBook Pro with Maxed out RAM - but it still is a little laggy - and the controls just don't work the way my finger memory expects them to on a Mac) - Which is pretty mandatory if you do a lot of network diagrams.<p>o Outlook Calendar - Entourage / booking resources - just didn't have it nailed last time I checked it out.<p>o Lookout - Spotlight/Mail search isn't horrible - but when I need to search for a keyword or two in 145,000 email and get an answer back in 1/10th of a second - Nothing beats Lookout.  I use it 20 times a day.  It truly is the google of mail searching (Ironically Google's Outlook index isn't that impressive)<p>With that said, I absolutely love the MacBookPro - best laptop I've ever owned.  And, I spend my entire day in a terminal - and, you may mock me for saying this, but I personally have decided the cost of OS X and a good portion of the Macbook is justified by the terminal client alone.  It puts Putty/SecureCRT to shame.<p>So - my solution has been to do both - I have the two keyboards (probably ergonomic nightmare) - one in front of the other, and do all my visio/lookout/outlook calendar on my five year old Precision 650 (Rock Solid workstation BTW), while Everything else is done on the MacBook Pro.   Two monitors - a cheap 20"" LCD for the Precision 650 and a 30"" Dell for the MBPro.<p>I have zero issue switching back and forth - when I'm on the mac, Command-Space comes as natural to me as Ctrl-Escape does when I switch back to the windows system.",1228883731

1594228,comment,1594054,1594054,0,0,swombat,,,"Counterpoints:<p>* Correlation is not causation.<p>* Poor people may often remain poor because they are not rational. Charity may not be a rational activity. So perhaps what they were measuring was not selfishness, but rationality.<p>* Being born in a rich family is correlated with a better education, so the point made in the article's last paragraph may be incorrect.<p>* I'm (currently) poor, but I don't think much of most organised charitable activities, or to giving money to homeless people. I think most charities are an utter waste, and giving money to homeless people only gets them buying alcohol and cigarettes. I'll happily give my sandwich to a homeless person on the street though. My suggested figure for ""% of salary to donate to charity"" is 0%, and will remain 0% for the rest of my life. However, once rich (assuming I get there), I'd be quite happy to devote years of my life to helping people directly (which may involve leveraging financial resources, but not donating money to charities).<p>* Average figures tell us little. What was the distribution? Did 90% of rich people suggest 0% and 10% of them suggested 50%? How did they get to the 2.1% figure?<p>* What kind of social pressure was there when asking people how much they would donate (of their credits, or of their salary)? Social pressure is a huge influence. Here on HN, an open-minded, thoughtful environment, I explain my views on charities above (even though I know I'll get some passionate replies). Sitting in a circle of people I don't know, I might still express these views (because I'm like that..) but most people probably would be wiser and keep those views quiet.<p>* What kind of social pressure was there before? What kind of social pressure did they expect after? Did people give an answer to please the examiner?<p>A lot of holes in this article, I think. Surprising, coming from a quality publication like the Economist.",1281516906

I've seen a lot of guys work like crazy while their girlfriend doesn't like it, and the guy thinks, ""Well, if this pays off she'll understand."" In my experience - not true.<p>People have different temperaments, and if she dislikes risk or wants a more regular amount of time and affection, that's unlikely to change and money doesn't fix the problems there. The best couples for entrepreneurship are ones where both guy and girl are excited by the process of working hard, striving for the impossible, putting in long hours, and can handle the emotional burden and strife that comes with that.  If your girlfriend doesn't have the temperament and you do, money likely won't solve that later.",1281516563

In each case, I went and got a job. It sucked working for some numb-nuts with a limp handshake, but needed the money. And I had two puppies and a girlfriend trying to get out of college on the first blow-up, which was no fun. Luck of the draw. I'm launching my third literally this week.<p>Unlike the previous occasions, I'm better educated. And I'm a lot less emotional. This is business. \nI have a standard that stipulates the following--if v 1.0 is over 1/3 late, you're probably throwing good money after bad, so time to ask where the execution bottle necks are.  At 2/3 late, time to ""come to Jesus"" on your start-up and start asking some very tough questions, like how did this get so borked and how can it be rescued. And at 100% over-run, don't think about it, just bail because you've screwed something up so bad that no amount of talk or analysis is going to rescue you. Get a job, build back up your finances and your marriage, and look for another opportunity.<p>And reflect on why you are in a start-up. Are you trying to change the world or have a cool work-place?<p>Start-up's are not for everyone, and certainly should be pursued carefully by those married and with financial obligations.<p>If you're putting your family through hell, you have to ask yourself how long is reasonable to do that. Ruining the finances of your family, or worst case getting turfed out of your home, is unacceptable. And when you have kids, it's no longer about your dreams and desires--it's about providing. You had your chance, it's gone, so suck it up and get ready to do what our own Fathers did--work for the Man and hope for the next generation.<p>I know that sounds harsh.

This <i>is</i> what textareas are for: unstructured input of a <i>string</i> (not prose writing, but simply a string) that may require newlines in it.<p>Coming right <i>after</i> the street address field would, of course, be separate single-line input fields for the city, country, etc... but the street address itself should allow as many lines as you need.",1281514142

It goes into great depth on all of the commonly used features of the language. I think I got to appreciate it more precisely because I already knew a good deal of Python. This book also shows the whys in Python and gives you an idea of what will be new in Python 3 (and why).",1281513876

If you look at the popular self-install apps, such as Wordpress, PHPBB, Drupal, etc. they are all written in PHP. There is a lot more small-scale hosting support for PHP, especially because of mod_php. Dump all the files in a public directory, fire up the URL and presto. While there are some RoR hosting providers who can do this, most of the target audience (ie. semi-literate tech people) are more accustomed to being able to install a PHP app.<p>I use RoR, but if I had to build a product that users would install on a server and run themselves, I would probably build it in PHP, despite the other known disadvantages.",1281513748

""Read, understand and re-implement software algorithms / architectures"" is to computer science as ""Read, understand and apply some given formulas to solve a problem instance"" is to maths/physics.<p>Formalizing and proving the correctness and boundaries of these formulas is the hard part here, where mathematicians are doing their job. You probably can implement a Support Vector Machine in one day given a detailed pseudo-algorithm, but truly understanding the underliying concept, as well as its weaknesses and strong points is way harder. Let alone improving it. And the very same thing can be said about a lot of other algorithms (MRF-optimization, coding theories, etc.).",1281513702

Like a morbid million monkeys mashing away on keyboards, operating at scale in meatspace all but guarantees that someone will die whilst using the service.<p>In America we have become accustomed to guard rails everywhere, and signs announcing the smallest hazards.  This is OK so far as it goes, but perhaps it makes us a bit soft.  Here we read about a tree swing that fell down when a full grown man used it.  At least 90% [1] of tree swings in America are built without professional engineering or even inspection.<p>I&#x27;m not apologizing for the host in this case, but I do think that some people are open to living in a world where not every conceivable danger has been mitigated.  The hard part is finding anyone so willing once a freak accident happens to them.<p>[1] I&#x27;m lowballing this estimate so much that it should be obviously true to anyone who grew up in the non-urban US.",1447048729

Fan/user<p>Anyway, yeah, I&#x27;ve actually had that thought in the back of my head. I&#x27;ve actually reloaded this laptop 3 times due to the exact situation you mention. (The HDD is too small to leave CrOS on there).<p>It&#x27;s been several months since I&#x27;ve let CrOS do it&#x27;s thing and reflash the firmware... I should give it a shot.<p>Many moths ago, I was reinstalling CrOS it to try to get it to reflash the adapter so that MST on DP1.2 would work. But it never worked and furthermore, the Dell monitors I have stop working when you enable DP1.2 so all around... it was disappointing.<p>I wanted my Pixel to be my sole development machine... but when I&#x27;m sitting at my desk... I expect dual monitors... So I continue to sync my git repos between 3+ computers at a time. Woohoo.<p>Whoever wants to make a laptop with 16GB RAM, HiDPI screen (and not the shitty Lenovo panels), and 2x mini-DP out.... boy, I&#x27;d sure love to see it.

10531580,comment,10531046,10531046,0,0,klausvanvinkle,,,"Whether torture is right/wrong good/bad boils down very simply.<p>First, let&#x27;s assume that torture works (i.e. it gives us the answers we want). If we assume it doesn&#x27;t work then there&#x27;s no point in torture or this debate. There will always be people who claim that torture works, so let&#x27;s just assume it does indeed work excellently and 100% of the time.<p>Second, assume that many innocent people are falsely accused and convicted, because that is true (if you don&#x27;t believe that, just look at the Innocence Project).<p>Third, if we know that innocent people are sometimes falsely accused and convicted, then it means it could happen to you, your parents, your children.<p>So now the only question you have to answer is: Are you OK with the scenario where you, an innocent and falsely accused individual, are tortured, in the interest of public safety? If you are not OK with that happening to you or your children, then you cannot support torture for anyone else either. If you are OK with that, then you have two tasks: 1) when are you volunteering as a torture subject to prove you aren&#x27;t just saying that, and 2) you must convince everyone else that they should be OK with that if it happens to them (or 51% of the population in a democracy). You might succeed on 1) (doubtful) but you will fail on 2) if all of those people also have to complete task 1).<p>The conclusion is that it&#x27;s impossible to torture without introducing a double-standard. Sure, we can do that, but that has the same logic as a law like &quot;I can do anything I want, and you can do nothing, because I&#x27;m me and you&#x27;re not me&quot;?",1447048552

10531577,comment,10531046,10531046,0,0,chroma,,,"I think torture should be illegal and I think the &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; techniques used at Guantanamo are abhorrent. But I also think there are real-world scenarios in which torture is not only moral, but where it would be <i>immoral</i> <i>not</i> to torture. This sounds absurd, but consider this real-life case given in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy[1]: A woman&#x27;s car is stolen. Unknown to the thief, her child is sleeping in the back seat. The thief discovers the baby and ditches the car. The police soon catch him at a train station. CCTV footage shows him stealing the car. It&#x27;s over 100ºF out. A police officer describes the incident:<p>> In the police truck on the way to the police station: “Where did you leave the Hyundai?” Denial instead of dissimulation: “It wasn&#x27;t me.” It was—property stolen from the car was found in his pockets. In the detectives&#x27; office: “It&#x27;s been twenty minutes since you took the car—little tin box like that car—It will heat up like an oven under this sun. Another twenty minutes and the child&#x27;s dead or brain damaged. Where did you dump the car?” Again: “It wasn&#x27;t me.”<p>> Appeals to decency, to reason, to self-interest: “It&#x27;s not too late; tell us where you left the car and you will only be charged with Take-and-Use. That&#x27;s just a six month extension of your recognizance.” Threats: “If the child dies I will charge you with Manslaughter!” Sneering, defiant and belligerent; he made no secret of his contempt for the police. Part-way through his umpteenth, “It wasn&#x27;t me”, a questioner clipped him across the ear as if he were a child, an insult calculated to bring the Islander to his feet to fight, there a body-punch elicited a roar of pain, but he fought back until he lapsed into semi-consciousness under a rain of blows. He quite enjoyed handing out a bit of biffo, but now, kneeling on hands and knees in his own urine, in pain he had never known, he finally realised the beating would go on until he told the police where he had abandoned the child and the car.<p>> The police officers&#x27; statements in the prosecution brief made no mention of the beating; the location of the stolen vehicle and the infant inside it was portrayed as having been volunteered by the defendant. The defendant&#x27;s counsel availed himself of this falsehood in his plea in mitigation. When found, the stolen child was dehydrated, too weak to cry; there were ice packs and dehydration in the casualty ward but no long-time prognosis on brain damage.<p>As much as we may wish otherwise, the answers to moral questions aren&#x27;t always simple. Every time I&#x27;ve related this story, it has convinced my interlocutor that torture can sometimes be moral. Again, that doesn&#x27;t mean it should be legal or systematized. To make an analogy with less emotional weight: theft and trespassing are illegal, but they&#x27;re sometimes right. One might trespass to get someone to a hospital more quickly. Or one might steal something so it can be used for some life-saving measure. People accept these rare, one-off situations. So too it should be with torture.<p>1. <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/torture/#CasStuBea"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/torture/#CasStuBea</a>",1447048467

10531566,comment,10529681,10531537,0,0,_dps,,,"The calibration cost is trivial compared to the coefficient learning cost. Very roughly, calibration is O(records) whereas coefficient learning is O(records * features). So the tiny add-on cost of calibration shouldn&#x27;t affect anyone&#x27;s evaluation of the relative merits of algorithms. NB still retains its computational advantage.<p>One thing that is often discounted in theoretical discussions is that NB takes <i>much</i> less I/O than something like LR, typically in the range of 5-100x (depending on how many iterations you want to do updating your LR coefficients). If you&#x27;re doing, for example, a MapReduce implementation then NB has huge computational advantages. In LR each coefficient update costs you another map/reduce pass across your entire data set (whereas NB is always done in exactly one iteration).<p>So if NB + calibration gets you something close to LR for vastly less computation and I/O, why <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> you use it?<p>Having said that, if you&#x27;re talking about small amounts of data that fit into RAM and you can &quot;just load into R&quot;, then sure use LR over NB. For that matter use a Random Forest [0]. The reason NB is still around is because it offers a point in the design space where you spend almost no resources and still get something surprisingly useful (and recalibration narrows the utility gap between NB and better methods even more).<p>[0] And you should <i>still</i> consider calibrating your random forest&#x27;s output.",1447048225

Could be null, could point to nowhere, the object pointed to could live temporarily, could live forever etc. However, there aren&#x27;t any pointers which only weaken some of these conditions.<p>The function I linked takes a possibly null raw pointer, and vouches that:<p>1. It points to null or something.\n2. The object it points to (if it is not null) will live at least as long as the current scope.\n3. The object it points to will not be mutated as long as the current scope is active.<p>Practically speaking, as long as you don&#x27;t do anything with the resulting Option<&T> other than check if it is empty, you&#x27;re safe. In addition, Rust will preserve the internal pointer address, so you could bring it back to the FFI. So you could treat it consistently as such, you&#x27;ll be fine. I&#x27;m not sure if the language spec guarantees that, because that&#x27;s not how Rust references are designed to be used, but it won&#x27;t matter in practice.<p>For what you want, you could just create a generic structure that holds a pointer to the given type, and lets you ask if the contained pointer is null. That way you won&#x27;t add any false guarantees to the pointer (e.g. immutability, lifetime, etc.).",1447047057

The raw pointer itself, even if non-NULL, is still &quot;tainted&quot;; you still want to apply manual runtime checks to it before casting it to a Rust reference. (And, past that, in both cases you still probably want to deal with the pointer mostly just by passing it back to other FFI functions from the same library, treating the pointer itself as an <i>identifier</i>, a key the API associates with something.)<p>I&#x27;m emphasizing this distinction because the NULLness of the pointer is, from what I can see, &quot;outside&quot; the lifetime of the reference, and even outside the &quot;identifier-ness&quot; of the handle. Knowing the <i>validity</i> of the pointer requires knowing about ownership/lifetime; the pointer might point to memory that has been free()ed. But you can know that the pointer is intentionally NULL (and therefore not a valid handle/identifier from the FFI&#x27;s perspective) <i>without</i> attempting to construct a reference.<p>Effectively, a [nullable] raw pointer is the moral equivalent of a tagged data structure. There&#x27;s a piece of metadata you can get from the tag: when it&#x27;s zero, the contained raw pointer is intentionally invalid; when it&#x27;s nonzero, the contained raw pointer is only maybe-invalid. You can destructure and act on the &quot;tag&quot; without doing anything else to the [non-nullable] raw pointer &quot;stored inside&quot;.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t expect most languages to care about a distinction this fine, because if a language has references, it really only wants to think about &quot;pointers: maybe invalid&quot; and &quot;references: always valid&quot;. But Rust is in the unique position of trying to work &quot;directly with C&quot; without the impedance mismatch of glue like SWIG. And C provides many libraries that return nominally opaque handles, but expect their consumers to notice if those handles are NULL (which happens often, when e.g. a factory-function from such a library is called with NULL arguments, or unexpectedly receives a NULL from a library it itself consumes.)",1447045501

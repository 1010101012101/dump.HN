This injection, which will be seen as unexpected by developers, might be used as an attack vector. Note that, even if you don&#x27;t have any subdomains, a MITM -- who controls the wire and thus the DNS -- can always make up arbitrary names and then inject from them.

As far as investigating or thinking about this as a personal individual, even if you are an employee, you can look at it this way, especially how the situation would change if BTC experiences even worse deflation (if it were to be adopted as a serious money supply without the supply increasing):<p>What is the average per annual interest rate on all loans on BTCJam?  A cursory look reveals &quot;invest your bitcoin and earn 19.3% APR&quot;.  Assuming your fees and other friction amounts to just an additional 2.5%, then we are at 21.8% - meaning, that if you have a business opportunity that you have a 98% expectation of generating a 21% return within 1 year, ($100,000 in, $119,000 out in year 1), you cannot finance it with this type of bitcoin loan.  And this is today, during a far from certain period for bitcoin and by no means a heavily deflationary one.<p>We are not currently in a great deflationary period for bitcoin.  If bitcoin were to tend toward $300K per btc - so that it represents value around the value of the gold supply or other world money supplies - from its current value of $450, in, say, 10 years (an eternity for the Internet) that would represent a 666x increase in value.<p>Annually, that would translate to a 91% APR.  (1.91^10=646) So the only way for anyone to borrow bitcoin, spend it on an investment, and then both return bitcoins - with an interest rate! - and still have some personal profit from the investment, is that if the risk-adjusted return from the actual real-world investment is 91%.  But that makes bitcoins impossibly expensive to denominate the loan in.<p>What if we denominate the loan in dollars?  Well, during a deflationary period, anyone would be nuts to lend bitcoins and receive 91% less back the following year, recouping just a little bit in interest rate.  The interest rate would have to be around 91% just to cover the new value of the bitcoins being returns.  Essentially, a lender of bitcoins would be short selling them.  A huge risk.  It might well be the case that they lend out 100 bitcoins, and a year later get back 1 bitcoin.  If they had held onto the bitcoins instead of lending them out, they would have enjoyed a +10,000% return on the real value of that specific holding.  Instead, the real value of the holding has remained steady at 110%, since it was denominated in dollars.<p>This establishes a very difficult hurdle rate.  Currently bitcoin does not experience such a deflationary period (indeed, it is worth less than it was at xmas and before), which makes lending denominated in usd considerably easier.<p>At other times however it will be far more difficult.<p>Essentially, bitcoin lending works &quot;ok&quot; as long as bitcoin itself is not taking a large role as a money supply.  If it does, then due to the impossible of scarcity (again, reasonable target is $300K/bitcoin under this scenario) lending will grind to a halt where lending is used for real-world production of value.<p>Lending may still occur under literal ponzi schemes.   (Borrow 10 bitcoins, promise to pay back 12 in a month...which you do - how, because in the meantime you&#x27;ve borrowed 14 bitcoins, promising to pay back 16 in a month...which you do - how, because in the meantime you&#x27;ve borrowed 18 bitcoins.... );<p>I think if you take a good, hard, look, at the source into the way in which these bitcoins are being paid back, you will find more than one literal ponzi scheme under BTCJam.  There is scarcely other explanation for the lending behavior of many of the entities there.  (Despite<p>For example,",1398437617

I was at times the ringleader that would make fun of particular kids and if I were a parent now, I would do my utmost to get me kicked out of school.<p>I grew up in a happy household, my parents were both highly educated, and my siblings and I are all relatively successful. I don&#x27;t think my parents even knew about my bullying because I was really good at making sure I didn&#x27;t get in trouble for it.<p>I didn&#x27;t bully everyone, just particular kids.  The best way to describe it is that I saw weakness in some kids, it sickened me, and I wanted to crush it. I didn&#x27;t do it to make myself feel better, or because I had self esteem issues or to make myself popular. I was amongst the top students in my class, had a bunch of friends, and even kind of nerdy so it wasn&#x27;t like I was a stereotypical jock picking on nerds.<p>I can&#x27;t explain why I felt this way, I just did.  And to be honest, I can still feel these feelings sometimes around certain people, but I just stifle them because I know it&#x27;s wrong. So I think it must be genetic and something I was born with because despite me knowing it&#x27;s wrong and I don&#x27;t want to act on my feelings, when I interact with some people I still get the same feelings of &quot;God this person is weak, I want to crush them.&quot;<p>This is why I recommend people fight back against their bullies. If the person I bullied punched me in the face, not only would I not want to get into a fight (as I mentioned I never physically attacked anyone and never got into fights because I was really good at picking kids who wouldn&#x27;t fight back) but then I would reconsider whether they were actally weak or not.",1398437539

All the allegations seem to disappear once we hear more details:<p>- The hula-hooping seems pretty innocuous. Some people start hula-hooping in the office, so other people start watching. It would be a pretty unusual thing to hula-hoop in the office, so it seems natural to watch it. There should be no reason to think the hula-hooping would cause male excitement (and if there was reason to think that, it probably shouldn&#x27;t have been done). It sounds like nobody else had a problem with it.<p>- The rug incident seems like a non-event. Why should &#x27;meritocracy&#x27; be divisive? The only problem it seemed to cause was preventing Horvath being accepted into a &quot;feminist hackerspace&quot;.<p>- The &#x27;harassment&#x27; against JAH from Heather and Tom now seems to disappear given the facts from JAH herself in valleywag. It seems that JAH was accused of starting the rumour against Tom&#x27;s wife, and that is why JAH was called into the HR office. JAH says that she was harassed because she was accused of starting the rumour, and Heather sat silently. It would seem very appropriate to talk to a worker accused of starting a vicious rumour, and get all the facts. Did JAH actually start this rumour, or was it a lie? That is a bit unclear at the moment.<p>- The IMs in the valleywag article just seem like a vicious rant from JAH against Tom and his wife. So Tom&#x27;s wife set up an office at Github. Perhaps not the most sensible idea given that she wasn&#x27;t an employee, but certainly not harassment.<p>- Regarding the allegation against Ted Nyman: she now says he reverted her edits because she wouldn&#x27;t date him (previously it was &quot;fuck&quot;). So all we know is that Nyman asked her out on a date, she refused, and he reverted some edits. Were those two things linked? To be honest I have my doubts, based on JAH&#x27;s other &quot;false positives&quot;.<p>Overall it looks like JAH is the bully and harasser here. It&#x27;s also ironic that she has achieved the exact opposite of what she wanted to achieve (advancing the position of women in the industry). Perhaps the lesson - unfortunately - is that it isn&#x27;t a good idea to hire a feminist.",1398437266

There is no double standard and there is no fair comparison.<p>It is not Matt Cutts who preaches how bad it is; it is the users (you and me) who are complaining about this and asking Google to take action. It is the user metrics showing something is wrong with the quality or experience.<p>Finally it is about intent. The spirit of the guidelines. It is only when blackhat spammers start exploiting techniques, that those techniques become punishable offences or are taken away. Google gives us popular search keywords? Spammers will automatically create crappy pages to target those. You can get a site to link to you by writing a quality article for their visitors? Spammers will write or outsource crappy articles and ruin article marketing for everyone. You are a charity and you want to create a widget with a link back to your site? Bummer... better add nofollow, because spammers used baity widgets like &quot;Which zombie am I?&quot; to link back to their clients&#x27; websites with targeted unrelated keywords.<p>If you go to the Google search results do you think: Damn what a commercial site! Animated ads everywhere! And all these scraped results they are trying to rank for without giving credit to the content creators...?<p>&quot;Ads above the fold&quot; are usually Google&#x27;s own advertisements. They ding webmasters for forcing their own ads onto their readers. So it is a decision about quality and reputation, not money or bullying small sites.<p>Do the all-things-being-equal test. Two sites equal in all regards, yet one has animated advertisements above the fold. Which one would satisfy your users the most? It&#x27;s a tiny factor, but it is there.

You use Cogent when you have a lot of bits to push and don&#x27;t particularly care if they&#x27;re going to get there (seriously, Cogent has like 25% packet loss at peak times.) Most companies use Cogent for overflow; i.e. they purchase enough transit through other providers for 80-90% of peak load, then fill out the rest with Cogent. It&#x27;s not that Cogent is a terrible company or anything; they just provide an inferior product at an appropriate price point. Cogent wasn&#x27;t interested in paying Comcast for better service because quality of service is not the product that Cogent provides. Their business model is to take advantage of their free peering status to sell unreliable transit at rock-bottom prices. Again; it&#x27;s not evil or anything, but when you use Cogent that has to be what you expect.<p>But Netflix was using them for almost 100% of their traffic delivery. That&#x27;s insane. There are other transit providers they could have paid more to and gotten better service, but that would have meant higher costs.<p>The whole irony of this situation is that I&#x27;ve heard rumors that Netflix is paying less per gigabit to Comcast than they paid Cogent while getting better service than they would get from a top-tier provider. If that&#x27;s true, other companies will be lining up to get a similar deal because they&#x27;d just be cutting out the middlemen.",1398436126

The acetobacters actually metabolize ethanol into acetic acid and survive in highly acidic environments such as the stomach.  As they are aerobic bacteria, you will also need to swallow air while drinking.  The amount of time that alcohol remains in your stomach makes it unlikely that you will make more than a tiny difference in the amount of alcohol that enters your bloodstream.<p>But it is much more scientifically plausible than baker&#x27;s yeast.<p>An actual, significant reduction in drunkenness from ingested alcohol would have to overstock the liver with ADH1B, thiamine (vitamin B1), ALDH2, ACSS2, and n-acetyl-L-cysteine (Acetadote).

On the web, however, it&#x27;s totally unacceptable. Sites are expected to keep working between multiple browsers and across multiple browser versions. To achieve that level of interop would have required someone to sit down and write a detailed specification of the dialect of SQL that should be supported on the web, and for browser vendors to take the time to implement it. In practice people weren&#x27;t willing to spend the time doing either of those things; the level of buy-in was enough to fork sqlite but no higher.<p>Eventually the web might get something like WebSQL. But the way it will happen will be for people to implement SQL in js on top of IndexedDB.

That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not thought police.</i><p>The &quot;actual steps&quot; were his democratic rights as a citizen in a free country. It was a matter put to vote, and he backed a specific outcome of the vote. Neither the vote was illegal, not he acted on anything outside of that.<p>Just because you think other people should &quot;obviously have that right&quot; doesn&#x27;t say anything. I think that people should have the right to consume whatever drug they want freely, and that they should have the right to not be executed by the state.<p>Are all persons who voted / backed laws against those things oppresive, or it&#x27;s only your particular pet cause?",1398434647

Though in my experience of interacting with people who have learned development in last 3-5 years, many of them are very oblivious to basic database concepts. They mostly think in terms of the object in the code, relying on the framework to take care of the database. It might even generate the sql that they just need to execute. But anyone who&#x27;s worked with production database from before the advent of frameworks like Rails etc. knows that the only thing worse than messing up an sql statement is running auto generated sql.",1398434635

7646475,comment,7645124,7645124,2,0,moron4hire,,,"Reading things like this always causes me to reflect on myself and my own relationship to work.<p>I&#x27;m envious of people who can work a job. My wife, for example, has been at the same place for almost 10 years. My father has worked the same place for over 30. They have their complaints, but they get up every morning and they go.<p>The longest I ever lasted anywhere was 2 and a half years. It was my second job out of college. I&#x27;ve had 5 jobs over the course of 7 years. One of those jobs only lasted 3 months. One was only 10 months. Both were a race to see if I would quit or get fired first. I won on the 3-month job, I lost on the 10-month one. They never gave an official reason, but I think they would say it was because I wouldn&#x27;t show up on time. Really, it&#x27;s because I had no respect for management.<p>I&#x27;ve been freelancing for the last 2.5 years. Excuse me, let me correct that, I was unemployed for 6 months after the 10-month deal. I thought I hated programming. After getting fired, I didn&#x27;t want to do it again.<p>A friend got me an interview at the place he worked, a small manufacturing firm. We started as a 3 month contract-to-hire, they wanted to hire me after the first month, and I stuck to wanting to contract. It scared the crap out of me. We were doing good work and being hired as an employee just felt like trying to ruin it. We worked out a consulting arrangement that, honestly, by most accounts is consulting in name only. I work so much for them that I don&#x27;t have time to pick up other projects. After 6 months, <i>told</i> them I was going to primarily work from home. After another 6 months, I moved to a completely different city and just kept working. They didn&#x27;t even know I wasn&#x27;t in the area anymore for 3 months until we did a video chat session and they saw my new apartment.<p>I don&#x27;t know what any of it means. If my client doesn&#x27;t add any new tasks and I finish out the list I have, I&#x27;ll have worked for them longer than I&#x27;ve worked for anyone. Them not adding any new tasks is highly unlikely. At the same time, I would see working for them for another 1 to be encroaching on &quot;failure&quot; and another 2 years to definitely be &quot;bad&quot;. Not in the sense that I wouldn&#x27;t be making good money (I&#x27;m making more now than any two previous years combined), but in that I have this emotional snag that sees staying in one place to be stagnating.<p>I don&#x27;t think I hate programming anymore, especially now that I&#x27;ve gotten back into running my own side projects. But I certainly <i>hate</i> common corporate organizational structure. I just can&#x27;t stand going into an office when I&#x27;m told, wearing what I&#x27;m told, <i>thinking</i> what I&#x27;m told (which seems to be the point of most employee handbooks). Every Joe Shmo with an MBA thinks he can start a consulting firm and hire a bunch of cheap programmers and turn it into a printing press for money. And they bring with them this cargo cult of Fortune 500 practices that ultimately feel dehumanizing. It turns my stomach even thinking about going to work as an employee.<p>But none of my family gets that about me. They just think I&#x27;m being difficult. Maybe I am, but I make more than all of them, so what is their problem? Just because I&#x27;m not clean shaven or put on pants most days means I can&#x27;t support a family? That&#x27;s probably an aspect of why I want to stick to not being an employee, out of spite for all of the people who have told me, &quot;just get a job already, just get out of bed on time and go to work already.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s very stressful. I&#x27;m constantly thinking about work and wanting to do something else. I don&#x27;t get to just turn work off at the end of the day and play a video game. And that&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m freelancing--as I said, my current client isn&#x27;t going anywhere. That&#x27;s my itchy feet, my knowledge of my past, and this haunting specter of some compulsion to find a new job.",1398434429

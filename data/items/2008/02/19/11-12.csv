If your 'diet' only gives you stuff that's high in fat and sugar, you're going to get fat.  If your 'diet' only gives you salad, you're going to get malnourished and waste away.",1203421880

We are now at a stage where we want to draft up the legal contract and wonder what other startups outline in their contracts.<p>We want to work on ramifications where if one partner looses interest in a project, the other may continue to pursue it; that is he would be penalized by reducing equity in the company. Also, what if one partners decides he wants to start working full time and earn an income, how does that effect equity.<p>Any thing we should be considering would be very helpful. Thanks!",1203420397

So far she has only been emailing and doing some surfing and online banking (her old computer had 32MB of RAM - ouch!).<p>Any advice for other nice things to show her? Google Earth is a nobrainer, and I will show her YouTube. Other than that? I myself only visit three sites regularly in my daily surfing: news.yc, a friend's community page and a ""normal"" news page, so I don't have that many ideas for getting entertained on the internet.",1203419864

118835,comment,118288,118288,0,0,ltratt,,,"There are many ways in which academia is non-transparent, but I don't think one journal rejecting double-blind reviewing is a major one. In the areas of computing in which I work not only can I guess who's written a paper (I would estimate at least 75% of the time off the top of my head, and with a little help from Google I imagine I could get well over 90%), but I can often guess who's written a review of my papers (perhaps 10-20% of the time). Computing might be an odd example - it's all I know. But I suspect that even most ""broad"" subjects end up breaking down into sub-areas where the participants tend to know each other pretty well.<p>Double-blind seems to me to be an attempt to try and cover up the much deeper flaws of ""peer review"". Peer review doesn't in practice mean that a peer-reviewed article is 100% correct, and that legions of scientists have honed every sentence. It means it got past the prejudices of a few reviewers, and (unless the reviewer is unusually committed) means that it didn't contain anything that screamed ""obviously wrong"" on a quick read through. When I get a genuinely good review (in particular if it finds a flaw in my work), I find it immensely useful, but these are sadly in the minority. IMHO the greatest reason why new-comers to the field find it hard to get papers accepted is because their ideas have a higher chance of grating against those held dear by the established people who act as reviewers; this is such a fundamental flaw in the system that fiddling with double-blind barely even counts as fiddling at the edges.<p>Given all this, it greatly amuses me when in North America to see products advertised as being based on peer reviewed science.",1203419154

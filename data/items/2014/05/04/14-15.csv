The problem I, as a European, have with the USA is that the government sees itself to have the moral authority to intervene in other countries&#x27; internal affairs to change our politics to their interests or pull us with them into their own wars. I&#x27;ve not spoken to a single person here in Europe who supports military intervention in the middle east, and to be honest I think the intervention of both the previous Soviet government and the current U.S. government is what breeds terrorism and threats from extremists.<p>The USA has - as a result of the cold war&#x27;s and the current interventions in other countries - expanded the role of the NSA, set up extensive airport security programs such as the TSA, and through Homeland Security they scrutinise every tourist&#x27;s history to the greatest of detail before actually letting them in. The ESTA application is only the surface of such. I consider the US government to be a very dangerous institution to safety and security for all human beings around the world.<p>I sincerely hope that the American public puts the US back on the right track. The current foreign policy is economically and socially unsustainable, the welfare state in the USA is crumbling and the middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate. The government seriously needs a big change. I am not encouraging revolutionary action, as I believe any government that needs violence to be instated is inherently flawed, but there needs to be a change. There&#x27;s a lot of focus on the wrong issues in the USA, especially amongst the youth, while the entire nation is heading towards economical and social regression.",1399215460

7694482,comment,7693961,7694285,4,0,unix-dude,,,"This and similar ideas are often passed around. There are a few cryptocurrencies which try to implement something like this (finding series of primes, for example).<p>There are a few problems with actually implementing your suggestions. You call hashing &quot;pointless&quot;, but it is anything but that. Hashing, specifically SHA256 in bitcoin&#x27;s case, has a well understood and possibly proven (?) level of difficulty. There is no known way to gain an advantage, other than simply throwing more computational power at the problem. Thus, because the problem being solved is arbitrary, random, and difficult, it takes a huge amount of computational power to make an invalid transaction.<p>Not only do you have to find initial &quot;acceptable&quot; hashes for your faked block, you have to create hashes of all the following blocks up until the present time, and push this version of the blockchain as legitimate until a majority of the network adopts it as the correct branch. The absolutely ridiculous computational power required to do this is what keeps transactions of cryptocurrencies safe. You don&#x27;t just have to fake one hash, you have to find and fake an entire chain of them!<p>Many scientific problems don&#x27;t have the same kind of guarantees about difficulty. And even if they are really, really hard, what happens when you find the answer? You&#x27;d essentially have to hard-fork all the clients. SHA256 and other hash functions used have a search space that is astronomically high, and is guaranteed never to be &quot;completed&quot;.<p>Hashing is a way to make transactions safe, permanent, and unmodifiable because of the cryptographic properties which come with the field. There&#x27;s very little chance of someone stumbling upon sequential solutions, and essentially impossible for someone to &quot;derail&quot; the blockchain due to those properties. The value that hashing provides are those guarantees.",1399215311

(Yay existentialism!)<p>When you think about the incredible number of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars, having untold habitable planets, existing for tens of billions of years? Then we think about our one planet Earth, and how each of us lives only 50-100 years and then we&#x27;re gone?<p>We have the question backwards. In the grand scheme of things, we&#x27;re much less than a speck on a mote somewhere, a fruit fly. We&#x27;re completely inconsequential. It&#x27;s not for us to ask what life is about. We have the question backwards. Instead life -- that thing that has existed for eons before we were ever a possibility and that will exist eons after our memory is gone -- is asking us &quot;What is the meaning of you?&quot;<p>Life sets us up with initial conditions and gives us various challenges as we go through our minuscule little part of it. It is during these experiences that Life is asking us what our meaning is. Our choices provide the reply.<p>Being alive is answering the question: what is my meaning? We could no more judge the meaning of life itself than we could begin to count the habitable planets in the sky.

7694478,comment,7694076,7694076,10,0,manifesto,,,"One reason why Chinese have less difficulty remembering and using these numbers than the western fellows might be the difference in pronunciation. In Chinese, all single digit number has the same structure: a consonant plus a vowel. For example, 7, in Chinese is pronounced as [ch-i:], while in English is pronounced as [ˈsɛvən]. Also, every digit takes the same time to pronounce. For example, a string &quot;123456&quot; is [yi:, er, san, si:, wu, liu]. That, in my experience, makes a long string of number easier to read out. And easier to read out means easier to memorize.<p>A side node: In China every kids in their elementary school if not kindergarten can recite the &quot;table of multiplication&quot;. That is, they can remember the answer from 1 * 1 to 9 * 9. I doubt how many westerners can do so, due to the language difference.<p>Edit: The asterisk symbol is driving me nut.",1399215249

Later I found out that Santa Claus was largely invented by Coca-Cola to sell sodas and all the unlikely, but commonly held, beliefs that he was omniscient and omnipresent for at least one night of the year was seriously undermined.<p>Then it was only a short jump to realise that Jesus was probably all made up too, that he wasn&#x27;t the son of God and, by extension, there might well not be a God.<p>I became a devout atheist at the age of seven - by &#x27;devout&#x27; I mean that were there to be a Rapture as some believe that there will be, I will consider the &#x27;proof&#x27; of the second coming to be symptomatic of hallucination, possibly a spiked water supply, and refuse to believe in God because I prefer to live my life that way without one.<p>The question &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; had no easy answers in &#x27;forgiveness&#x27;, or &#x27;love thy neighbour&#x27;, or the promise of an afterlife for those who did good deeds as if we were on Santa&#x27;s omniscient list of good children to recieve presents. So I used logic and logic alone to arrive at the definitive objective answer no matter how it may seem uncomfortable to my sensibilities to reveal it.<p>The truth is, that to ask this question objectively you have to necessarily be totally objective about life and to be objective about anything you have to be outside of it with a detached point of view. With &#x27;life, the universe and everything&#x27; with a whole &#x27;philosophical universe of discourse&#x27; included in the set of things being considered I had to immediately dismiss all instrinsic attempts at an answer as not definitively objective due to their lack of detachment and inescapable subjective bias.<p>Realising that I needed to be outside the &#x27;universe of discourse&#x27; to properly pose the question I saw what the difficulty with answering this had been all this time...<p>...&#x27;meaning&#x27; is part of the &#x27;universe of discourse&#x27; and it not available if outside of it.<p>Consequently, all claims to a definitive meaning of life are erroneous in logic as an objective answer cannot be found. It is not so much that life is meaningless and we should all be nihilistic atheists, but that we are free to live any way we please as there is no wrong answer - as there is no definitive objective ULTIMATE answer!<p>Every way you wish to give your life meaning is equally valid for your life, with the caveat that this is an ephemeral guideline you choose to adopt not an eternal truth - actually, I like the way this same argument was presented &quot;in reverse&quot; by Mr Sivers  as whenever I have posted about this in various fora in the past I have felt that I&#x27;ve come across as overly alienating by hitting them with the cold truth first instead of pandering to their intimately held, but unfortunately subjective, beliefs. Putting it all the other way around encourages more people to read on and seems more life affirming - even if I know, in truth, that life is without extrinsic meaning.",1399214232

Part of my problem in college that I was always fixated on having a mentor but never asked myself who my Barnabases and Timothys were.<p>As the years passed, I put aside this unhealthy fixation on having this spiritual mentor and I found myself begin to grow as I embraced the people around me as Barnabases and Timothys.

I can live with that. I recommend several other programs much more than I recommend Khan Academy.

How about you downgrade every https website to Yellow color, unless it uses PFS (only with a few good cipher-suits) and the latest version of TLS. Requiring HSTS would probably be good, too. They should also be required to have 100 percent of the site under https, before getting the Green color. No mixed content.<p>Right now you (and other browsers, too) give the &quot;safe&quot; color Green to to the bare minimum of https security, even if it uses TLS 0.9.8 and RSA 1024-bit. Sites are not going to upgrade their security policies as long as you, the browser vendors, keep showing them to the users as &quot;perfectly safe&quot;. There&#x27;s no incentive in it.

From a Ray Kurzweil article:<p><i>&quot;Kurzweil noted that many people don’t understand the basic math of exponential trends.  When the Human Genome project had sequenced only 1% of the genome after seven years of costly labor, many cited the lack of progress as evidence that the project was doomed.  Yet the sequencing project was riding an exponential trend in the performance DNA sequencing methods.  Instead of taking another seven years to sequence a second 1%, they reached it after only one year. Then they reached 4% in about another year, then 8%, 16%, and so on.  It took about as much time to sequence the last 99% as it took to sequence the first 1%.  That’s the nature of exponential trends — they seem to start glacially slowly but finish lightning fast.&quot;</i>",1399212092

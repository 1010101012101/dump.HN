Getting a book published in print even now is quite an undertaking when you consider all the individuals, money, and infrastructure involved.  The elimination of that infrastructure and closer coupling of content creators to their channels of distribution (i.e. fewer middlemen between them and publishing) will probably provide a bit more leverage to content creators, but it's still not clear how much, how fast, or what the cost will be to everybody else.

This comment sounds like the opening of a public negotiation, an aggressive one in which we try to get the other side to name a number first. We do so in public to leverage additional social pressure (""Look at all the commenters who <i>want</i> you to sell your work at a fixed rate, so that we can derive much more valuable things from that work and keep the profits for ourselves"") and to better evoke the as-yet-imaginary competitors (""you should give out your code on flat-rate terms, because otherwise we'll switch to Project X, which is just like Meteor, has a more permissive licensing scheme, and ships with <i>ponies and rainbows</i>"").<p>The last threat is pretty empty, though. When a customer tells you ""I don't like your price, I'm going to wait six months and download a clone of your code for free from the Internet"" the correct response is generally ""good luck with that, and enjoy your six-month vacation"". Those clones will always exist - in the case of Meteor, unless it proves to be a flash in the pan, they will exist by the <i>dozen</i>, and some of them may even get written by programmers with the same skill as the Meteor folks, and I wouldn't even rule out the ponies and/or rainbows. But that doesn't mean Meteor stands no chance against these ""free"" alternatives: No code is one hundred percent free. You pay for the code, you pay for the support, you pay a developer to do the support, or you pay with time, but you still have to pay.<p>And the first threat is empty, too, because Meteor doesn't need to court <i>everyone</i> in the world as a customer. It doesn't necessarily matter even if their non-GPL price is too high for all but one customer. They may only need one customer. Ask the folks who sold MySQL to Oracle.",1334332455

It needed to use an arbitrary precision math library, and it needed to use a freely distributable but closed source library.<p>2. This program was distributed in source form. In the source code there were #ifdefs to allow it to be built to use either of the two most common arbitrary precision math libraries. One of these was under a BSD license and one was under GPL.<p>3. Many systems did not have either math library preinstalled, so someone who wanted to build this program on those would have to go download whichever math library they decided to use.<p>4. Stallman claimed that distributing the program induced people to download the math libraries, and since one of the libraries was GPL, the program was inducing distribution of GPL code, and so itself must be placed under GPL.<p>5. The author of the program wrote a new math library that was just a wrapper for the BSD library, but that provided the same interface as the GPL library. Now people who chose to build the program with the build option to use the GPL library could successfully build by using this new non-GPL library. Since the source code no longer contained a build option that necessarily induced those electing it to go and download GPL code, Stallman was satisfied.",1334332218

You have to make it happen within the corporate systems and structure.<p>I have many times. A few examples:<p>- Boss to me: ""Purchasing is complaining that the legacy system isn't doing what it should. Go find out what they need."" 3 weeks later, my prototype is the basis for specs for a whole new system. ""But you told me to.""<p>- PM/BA to me: ""I can't make it to the status meeting. Will you run it for me?"" ""Sure."" Results: 3 new projects at the top of my queue. What the customer wants most and what will be fun to build.<p>- Big Boss in meeting: ""I don't think corporate will approve $2 million for a Data Warehouse/Business Intelligence system, but we have to do something."" One month later, after squeezing it in to my spare time: an MVP of a BI system that the users love and was fun to build. Now I get permission to finish it.<p>- Another boss: ""I would love to sell our stuff on Amazon, but I don't know how to go about it."" Me: ""Want me to find out?"" Boss: ""Yes."" A month later, we're on Amazon. Fun project.<p>- User VP: ""Why do we have to wait 3 years to get anything done on our legacy system?"" Me: ""Send the quick critical stuff directly to me. I'll try to push it through faster."" Almost always leads to building something cool.<p>The 3 keys to doing these kinds of things:<p>1. You must find the cool stuff to build yourself. No one's going to hand them to you. Opportunities are everywhere.<p>2. You'll probably have to make time for extra work. Shouldn't be a problem if you're a good programmer in an enterprise.<p>3. You'll probably have to hang your cool new stuff off something legacy. So what?<p>Maybe not as good as building something in a startup for the first time ever, but building is building.

Give me some money for my business, and in return I will issue you shares of bleg!"" And my family says, ""oh cool! great! what does bleg get me?"" And I respond, ""well it get's you a percentage of the total outstanding bleg, of course!"" And my friends ask if owning bleg will get them the chance to vote on how my store is run.

No it isn't it is the software that is the AI. 
It is the set of instructions that he is following that understands Chinese. 
The argument that the creator of the experiment used against this was that if you removed the pen and paper and had the man do it all in his head, then the man still doesn't understand, but he completely missed the point. In that case it just changes from the pen and paper + man that is the hardware to purely the man.<p>The Chinese room argument against AI falls down when you remember that the man is only the hardware. He may be essential to the running of the software, but he is just as much the mind of the Chinese translator as my processor is the maths running through it.",1334329784

I don't think so. Learning the fundamental data structures are a lot more useful for that purpose, I think. Of the standard crop, I think the binary search is a good algorithm to teach (though one must note its historical implementation problems in languages with fixed int sizes), and if you're going to do sorting then quicksort + insertion sort when N < 16 wouldn't be awful. At least mention the language's built-in sort so that open source projects like gnu flex don't inherit a DIY sorting function in the code (in their case, the evil bubble sort which should never be taught).<p>Instead of the cast of characters for sorting algos, I'd rather see something like this cast of maze generation algos: <a href=""http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorit...</a> I think they would accomplish your goals better, plus they have shininess built-in.<p>>""Lets learn Unity3D"" course in front of me, I would never ever attend that university.<p>But you would probably still be doing programming and CS elsewhere.

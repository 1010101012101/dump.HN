3854012,comment,3852881,3852881,2,0,chao-,,,"Having learned Mandarin and Japanese as a second and third language, respectively, I've been sharing this as an opinion for years, with some examples and anecdotal evidence to back it up. My core observations have been thus:<p>Mandarin, while there is of course grammar, it doesn't get in the way much. The basic idea is that you throw some words one after the other and the other person gets the right idea. That basic idea can get you very far. It sounds like it would be ambiguous, but rarely feels that way in practice.<p>Japanese, on the other hand, to get beyond sounding like a 5-year old you need to brush up on a lot more grammar. And even then, any given sentence, for all of its grammar and four- or five-syllable conjugations, can stretch on and on, but still be ambiguous as all hell. Part of that is cultural, though: a dash of ambiguity can provide some added politeness.<p>Here though, I must reference Symmetry's comment for fairness. Casual/conversational Japanese can be very abbreviated and through a combination of implicit topics, dropped/ignored/shortened conjugations and such doesn't feel so slow when spoken.<p>Here I'm going beyond the information density per syllable addressed by the study, but it was nice to see that aspect studied formally, even if it isn't the whole picture.",1334685252
3854011,comment,3852881,3853285,2,0,sassafras,,,"Strictly speaking, Japanese is moraic, in that it divides the rhythm of speech into units potentially smaller than a ""conventional"" syllable.  For instance, the transliteration of ""ice"", as in ""ice cream"", would be three mora: ""a"" ""i"" ""su"".  To me this is somewhat problematic, as the methodology of the study had native (or proficient) speakers counting the syllables as the corpus was transcribed, and it's unclear to me whether a native speaker would even count syllables in the same way an English speaker would.  Another potential flaw is that the syllables counted were for ""careful"" speech, which differs phonetically from casual speech even in formal registers.  For instance, the word ""kakushita"" (hidden) is technically 4 mora long, but in normal speech the u and i are effectively swallowed, even though a speaker would pronounce them if carefully sounding out the word.  In this sense, either syllable or mora count is not necessarily a great metric, as you'd probably be better off counting the number of uttered phonemes in recorded speech.<p>However, the study is still quite interesting.  Besides the syllabic analysis and derived information density, they also analyzed recorded speech for the time necessary to convey equivalent semantic content, and while this metric diverges somewhat from the others, Japanese still comes out at the bottom of the group.  It's worth pointing out that if this hypothesis is correct, it's not at all in conflict with anecdotal observations about the high context in Japanese conversation.  If anything, one would expect context to take over when formal information density is low, much the same way that tonal languages often have comparatively low phonemic inventories.",1334685250

All of those exchanges are obligated to trade at the same prices.  To ensure this, Reg ATS establishes the NBBO:  National Best Bid/Offer.  If you're buying, and one exchange has an offer at $10.00 and another has an offer at $9.00, $9.00 is the best offer.  If you send an order to the exchange that has a $10.00 offer, they are legally obligated to send that order to the exchange with the best price.<p>Latency arb is the process of keeping quotes/prices in sync by trading when a specific exchange's prices don't match NBBO.  Many of the largest HFT players work on a very simple principle: they subscribe to all of the exchange feeds and construct their own NBBO that is faster than the best commercially available NBBO feed.  With this, you know what direction stocks are moving as it happens.<p>Keep in mind that a ""price movement"" rarely occurs at a specific instance in time.  It occurs over the horizon that it takes for the market to synchronize -- which happens as fast as possible and is based on the infrastructure investments of high frequency traders.  If you can do it faster and you build the infrastructure the world is yours.  Like Vanderbilt with railroads.",1334684355

3853819,comment,3853357,3853357,16,0,jarrett,,,"Here's a fun example of why the government should maintain its own databases and use them to pre-fill your taxes.<p>This year, the state sent me a letter claiming I had paid zero taxes in 2010. They said I had to pay 100% of my tax liability right away or face liens, etc.. Of course, this was patently untrue--my employer had actually withheld more than my total tax liability for 2010. (I know this because I still have my 2010 W-2). So I was entitled to a refund for 2010, but the state was saying I owed them the full amount, plus penalties.<p>After contacting the state about this, they said the problem was that my W-2 form had likely become ""detached"" from my 2010 return.<p>So apparently, the state relies on a <i>paper copy of your W-2 attached to your return</i> to determine whether your employer has paid them the withheld taxes. If they can't find the W-2 you send them, they assume your employer didn't pay them anything on your behalf. Given that employers are already making electronic payments each quarter, why can't the government just derive its W-2 data from that? (I know, I know--they're probably not collecting that data right now. But the point is they could do it as part of the quarterly payment process.)<p>EDIT: Another funny bit to this story. I asked the state to confirm that my employer had indeed paid the amount reflected on my W-2. I figured that if the error was on my employer's end, I could take it up with them.

The way it generally works is you pay when you ""remove liquidity"" from the book and you get paid when you ""add liquidity"" to the book.<p>What does that mean? Suppose the bid/ask is 20.00/20.10 as in the example given. The order book will show a bunch of people willing to pay 20.00, 19.99, 19.98, etc, and a bunch of people willing to sell for 20.10, 20.11, 20.12, and so on. All of those people have added ""liquidity"" to the book by making orders which have not yet been placed. The idea is that a huge buyer could come in and try to buy 1 million shares at 20.25, and that order could get immediately executed because of the backlog of non-executed orders.<p>If you bid 20.10 (i.e. offer to buy the stock at 20.10) the seller at the top of the book will have his order executed (with you) and you will have removed a tiny bit of liquidity from the book. On the other hand, if you bid 19.95, your order just gets added to the system, and you have added a bit of liquidity.<p>The exchanges will charge you slightly more for removing liquidity (say .05 / share) than they pay you for adding liquidity (say .04 /share) and so make a spread. However, high frequency strategies can be clever about the way they add and remove orders to the book in order to minimize their net transaction costs, and so they end up being rather low.<p>On the other hand, when a retail investor purchases a stock through Schwab or something, Schwab (or in many cases some other larger bank) is dealing with exchange fees directly, and simply charging their customer a flat commission on top of your trade.",1334683233

It doesn't even work on a per-minute basis - at best, it works on a daily basis.<p>So if we were talking about how the financial markets benefit the <i>real</i> economy, we would say that Alice wants to sell at price X on Tuesday, and Bob wants to buy at price Y on Tuesday. And in that case, the go-between is unnecessary.<p>Nobody in the real economy needs instant order fulfillment when even regular bank transfers take a day to clear.<p>I get that more frequent dealings can help with finding ""right"" prices. It certainly reduces the spread. The problem is that HFT makes market access unequal.<p>You claim that Alice could have held out for $10.05 if she had wanted to. This is incorrect. Alice most likely does not have the infrastructure in place, and the fixed costs would be far too high for her to participate in that game. So in fact Eve did not provide any kind of useful service to Alice. Eve exploited unequal access to the market for her personal gain.<p>From a libertarian perspective you may say that's fine, granted. But the argument that Eve provided a service to the real economy is not as clear as you make it seem.<p>So there is a tradeoff there. HFT reduces spreads and perhaps helps price finding. However, for most market participants form the real economy, intra-day fluctuations dominate the spreads by orders of magnitude <i>anyway</i>, so reducing the spread isn't even that much of a useful service to the real economy - at least not to the extent it happens today. On the other hand, HFT makes access to the market unequal, limiting market competition.<p>It seems unlikely to me that the current situation is a proper balance within this tradeoff.",1334682992

He demonstrated a way of embedding whitespace in a forum post that is mapped to a malicious JS method injected via XSS. The point was to circumvent HTML sanitation attempts to strip raw JS code.<p>This tool could be used for something similar. Just replace the semicolon token[2] with something less obvious (say '\t' for example), and you've got a pretty interesting tool.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Hoffman"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Hoffman</a>

This may have been b/c they were dumb (hard to believe) or because converging at the same time (15:30:10 instead of 15:30:10.175) gives them better chances to finding a match to their sell/buy position",1334682036

Surely solving for that case first and letting those people who will always pay accountants to minimize their liabilities continue to file on paper would increase general welfare.

Granted, they're assuming risk by doing this, but the risk is low, especially given that they can also cancel in milliseconds if the market shifts.",1334682023

Unfortunately he fails to mention another closely related term to high frequency which is what makes this type of trading highly lucrative: 'Front running'. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running</a> .<p>Front running is illegal, but if you look for successful cases of high frequency trading they are generally tied-to/accused-of front running. And as you might imagine, in order to do front running you need to be high-up on the food chain (i.e. be a market maker)<p>The missing key about front running in the article is the 'anonymous' bid-ask: ""The matching engine takes his order and displays it (anonymized) to all other traders with a data feed."" and ""She places her orders, and it is again displayed to the world (anonymously) and stored."".<p>If you have forehand knowledge of the bid-ask (i.e. non-anonymous) the market maker can front-run and with high-frequency make a considerable profit.",1334682003

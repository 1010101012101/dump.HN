4615167,comment,4614676,4614676,3,0,smegel,,,"I could not disagree more strongly with this post. For me, managing a todo list has been the single greatest boon to my own productivity and self-management I have ever come across.<p>That is not to say I think most or any todo list applications are worth while - I think the vast majority of them are really terrible as they are far too complex or constraining, require too much overhead to do the simple things like creating a task or changing a task status, are too opinionated about <i>how</i> you deal with your todo items (like forcing schedules, reminders or due dates), lack hierarchical structure and lack any kind of free-form input.<p>The best (and only) worthwhile app that I have ever encountered is not even a todo list app - it is simply a Google Docs document that I leave open in my browser on various computers. I use whatever kind of free form structure I want to dump my thoughts and ""todo"" things that I feel like at the time - and annotate task status with free text tags and tokens that suit me as I go. Various parts of the documents will at times look like todo lists, plans, schedules, itineraries, work-flows, inventories, idea-lists, collections and more - and it is constantly evolving as the state of my work and activities evolve. Important, current stuff goes at the top - for example my first two blocks are titled ""Appointments"" (dont want to forget those!) and ""Today"" (what do I absolutely need to do today). Going down the blocks tend to reduce in priority/importance - for example my very last block is called ""Learning"" which is a list of various things that I would like to learn more of when I have time (not that learning isn't important, but it is a long-term background activity that I don't need to be reviewing every day).<p>If I have some thoughts or plans that I feel are important, but I dont want to focus on them now, I will just dump them in the document and move on to something else. Later I can come back and review that dump, maybe translate it into actual todo item or evolve it into a planned work-flow. This ""thought dumping"" is a well researched (there is a quite famous book about it I believe) way of self-management and I find it very effective.<p>The most important thing is there is no structure, form or anything other than what I impose on myself - you literally get a blank, empty page and <i>that is it</i>.",1349397716

4615121,comment,4614486,4614950,3,0,brandnewlow,,,"Hey, Josh,<p>So one of the ideas we're bringing to the table is that retargeting is really a pretty typical web service/product that happens to involve advertising.  It's SaaS masquerading as ads.<p>If you follow that line of thought through and try to think of things that are awesome about SaaS products you love, you get a retargeting platform that works a bit different:<p>1. Our product isn't designed to make you dependent on an account manager over the phone.  We see that with a lot of ad products.  A big reason this happens is because ad companies want to keep open an upsell channel and control client spend to a degree.<p>That creates opportunity for us.  I don't need an account manager to use Mixpanel, or Optimizely, or Stripe.  Those companies invest in great documentation, good support, and great UI.<p>So that's what we've done as much as we could.  Example: Advertisers get an automated ""campaign manager"" page that analyzes your campaign performance relative to global benchmarks set by all our users campaigns.  It makes recommendations on when to update your ad creative, which domains to blacklist, and when to narrow your targeting based on real performance stats.  Ad smarts at your fingertips.<p>This is all basic stuff an account manager does at other companies.  At Perfect Audience, we automated it.  We think that's cool.<p>2. Our segmenting tools are pretty great.  You can create retargeting lists based on path or Querystring (for retargeting people from an ad campaign, for example).  We've also written a simple, elegant Javascript Tracking API that lets our customers fire conversions and segment pixels based on arbitrary javascript events.  It's getting heavy use right now and was something a lot of people asked for.  Instead of us telling you how you can segment your traffic, we give you the tools, document them, and you tell us when you want to fire off your conversions and segments.<p>We have a loooong list of things we're working on that are coming out in the next few months.  Some of these things don't exist in any way shape or form on the market, and we're stoked about them.",1349396442

A to-do list should be for things that you need to do, not thing that you'd like to do some day.<p>Here is what I do when I need to be particularly organized and productive.  I call it a to-done list.  (I'm lazy and probably have ADHD, so I never sustain.  But whenever I do this it feels great, and it is never hard to start it up again when I get motivated.)<p>I start with a small list of things that I absolutely have to do, in roughly the order that I plan to tackle them.  Put that in a plain text file.  Write the date below that list.<p>Take the bottom task, break it up into subtasks, recursively, until I've got a task I can work on right now.  Do it.  Move it down off the list to the date.  If I get blocked on that one, add the blocker below the task and pick another task.  Continue all day.<p>The next day I start by putting that day's date above the old date, and then continue again.<p>The keys to this are the following:<p>1. I ONLY include things that I HAVE to do.  (Adding all of the, ""It would be good to some day"" or ""I'd like to"" leads to depression as described by Jeff.)<p>2. Items are SPECIFIC and SMALL.  The goal is to constantly move them off the list into done.<p>3. Only include CURRENT stuff.  If there is a project that is intended for 3 months from now, it does not go on the list.<p>This list serves 2 purposes.  The bit at the top is pretty much a LIFO stack (I add at the bottom, take off from near the bottom) of what I am currently working on.  So it is the whole, ""I need to do Y in order to do X, be sure I get back to X eventually.""  And the long list at the bottom is a log of how much I got done, which makes me feel good.<p>If you try this, be aware that a quickly growing top section is proof that you're doing it wrong.  Go through the top bit and ruthlessly prune off everything that doesn't need to be there.  Yes, I know that some people feel good about taking a list of high level tasks and breaking it up right away to get organized.  But really, this makes the list explode, and you won't do as good a job of exploding it out as you will when you are closer to actually doing that item.<p>The rule of thumb is, if you have trouble scrolling through the todo to the already done, the todo is clearly too long.",1349395903

And for old bugs, you need to spend even more time reconfirming if they are still relevant.<p>Everybody hates this. Why not exploit the recurrent nature of bug reports, and assume the users will ask us about it again if it matters?<p>I can't think of an instance where we were really glad that we saved some minor bug reports from months and months ago.",1349395869

When you look closely you realize that months or years of work has gone into preparing those bug reports, and you ask yourself, how could we have 3000 bugs in the database while our product is delightful and customers love it and use it every day?

It will be interesting to see if Google then considers this an ""incompatible fork"" of Android and threatens to boot ZTE out of the Open Handset Alliance as they did with Acer/Aliyun. Given the parts of the code shared (only low level device driver / HAL type stuff) are so distant from ""core"" Android and so minor it would seem pretty extreme for them to try and claim this. Nonetheless they might technically have the right to do so, so it will be an interesting test of whether they are truly motivated by desire to keep Android compatible or are actually being anti-competitive and wielding OHA membership as a club to keep potential rival OSes from emerging.",1349395455

It's the odd-ball things that need to get done, but aren't pillars for future progress in the day and are out of my normal routine. To pick a random example, dropping off a letter in the mail bin. If I don't do it, I wouldn't know for the rest of the day because I'm never going to think, ""Oh, I can't submit my progress report because that letter is still in my backpack!"" And I don't do it often, so I'm used to ignoring the mail drop boxes anyway. Aside from my brain either randomly remembering or pulling on a long thread and re-deriving the need to mail a letter, there's no reason it would come to mind.

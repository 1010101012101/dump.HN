The first thing you notice there, is that there's plenty of illegal competition. In one of the biggest shopping centers in Moscow, there is a shop just a side of an authorized Apple reseller that tries to sell you an <i>iPhone</i> (which is actually a chinese TVPhone).<p>Apart from this, I really do think that Russia needs its own Silicon Valley with VCs and Incubators from U.S. There are many talented people with innovative ideas and products.<p>Speaking of corruption level and unsafe environment, I don't think that India is better, but nevertheless they have their own SV with well-established VCs from the States.",1266317996

I made sure it was played at my father's funeral last year September. He was a Christian minister.<p>My father died of a sudden heart attack, a day after his birthday and two days after mine. We had never talked that much about death, but I remember he once said that he wasn't interested in living to any ripe old age.<p>I'm glad I didn't have to watch him suffer.<p>I've been thinking a lot about euthanasia lately. And my position is that if I were ever in a position where I couldn't take care of myself, and saw no hope that my condition would change, I would want to die.<p>I don't remember his name but a year or two ago, a famous British composer and his wife decided to on Euthanasia after one of them was diagnosed with a terminal illness. They died together, holding hands I think, with their favourite music playing. There's something noble about this that appeals to me.<p>If I get to choose, I'd like to die to the strains of Barber's 'Adagio for Strings'",1266316410

1128655,comment,1128481,1128499,0,0,thwarted,,,"The ads in magazines are just as relevant, IMO, as adsense ads (at least because print ads are targeting a demographic rather than direct intent), and Google seems to be doing an okay job with their method of ad targeting.  The news/magazine publishing industry is stuck in a seriously delayed feedback loop, it can take months for an advertiser to see returns on their marketing/advertising investment.  With things like adwords, you can see it almost instantly, and (assuming you have funnel analytics) almost down to the specific part of the page that generated revenue -- you can't do that at that kind of detail with magazines that are published on a slow cycle and are only accessible bulk (you buy/subscribe to the whole item, not access to individual entries, no one can track which parts of a 50 page magazine you read).",1266315687

Your business model should be robust enough to withstand this also. Consequently, a new worker who downloads and walks away is no greater threat than the existing competitor, assumed or real. Stronger stated... the loss of IP and consequent spread of one of your infinite resources... why that's beneficial advertising in this day and age. Get the business model right, and the IP worry disappears.<p>Open source is like the musician giving away free mp3s.

They know what it's like to have many things going on simultaneously, and have the experience to reason about it more easily than those with a pure software background<p>With aggressively multi-core systems becoming more common (we are routinely using systems with 32 cores, and then we use 30 or more of them) material like this is becoming more relevant.",1266314620

Consider that most of the world spends the majority of their time trying to acquire money, viewing it as the key to doing what they want to do. In reality, all they’re doing is spending wealth (in the form of time) only to earn it back in the form of money, so they can then use it to buy back time.""<p>The author assumes that people spend the majority of their time trying to acquire money without any other motive than acquiring money to further other goals. This argument fails when you do what you do not only because it brings you money but also because you like doing it per se.

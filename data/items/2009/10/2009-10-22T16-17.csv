And the horniness comes back real quick with a vengeance when you're college aged :-)<p>Do everything possible to get out of your room and meet women while you are in college. Be neatly dressed: doesn't mean trendy or a fashionista, just wear ordinary clean clothing. Join clubs, take up a hobby, randomly walk around with a smile on your face.<p>BE PLEASANT. Seriously. Practice smiling if you must, but no one wants to talk to a grump. Talk to people. A big mistake is to confine yourself to talking only to attractive people. Talk to anyone who will respond and shut up if they don't. Say hi to that strange chick at the bus stop: the one with the lazy eye, a unibrow and a humpback. She's a person, be nice to her. Greet people with a ""hello"" and a smile, hold doors for strangers, help the old lady with that heavy bag of catfood.<p>In short, become a nice person and people will want to be around you. Once that happens, the whole women/intimacy/sex thing tends to take care of itself. The species has managed to propagate itself basically forever. That wouldn't happen if it was terribly hard to hookup.<p>In order to meet girls, you have to talk to them. Most of them won't just walk up to you and bite you on the ass. Get out of your shell, stop worrying about being awkward. Trust me, the women are also worrying about stuff that you would think is trivial: we all have our insecurities.<p>Wasting money on a hooker is avoiding the responsibility for changing your own life. You'd be better off spending it on a therapist.",1256230798

Its a simple CRUD application, with a requirement that it needs to go offline (the client's business is a mobile one, and one that involves auditing equipment.

Or, is it a start-up?<p>If it's just a project, then it's probably just a hobby and you can make the decision based on how much you enjoy your hobby.<p>If it's meant to be a start-up, then I think you need to focus on producing some hard data on market size and potential revenue before you even start thinking about the possibility that the space is too crowded. Whether or not the market is too crowded depends not so much on what features you can offer over your competitors' products, but on how much money you could potentially.  Can you compete in this market and cover your development and infrastructure costs?  Beyond that, do you think that you can eventually make enough profit that the opportunity cost of pursuing this specific start-up is worth it?<p>Regarding revenue:
  What is your business model?  Do you charge people for your application?  Do you count on advertising income?  Is the application designed in a way that generates revenue through virtual currency purchases or pay-per-action?  Have these revenues been growing in line with your user base?<p>Regarding market size:
   How many Facebook users do you think will eventually use this type of application?  How many of them do you think will use <i>your</i> application?  What percentage of invites to your application are accepted (are conversions)?  When you graph your new users and your conversion rate, are they growing exponentially (like any tech start-up should be initially)?  Or, it is only growing at a slow increment, nearly flat, or declining?  They graphs would help you determine your overall growth and what percentage of total Facebook users you may be able to convert.  That would help you answer the most important questions (those regarding financials).<p>If either the growth of your income or your user base are not growing exponentially, I would suggest that you think about possible ways to increase both to that level of growth and factor the amount of work required into your decision.<p>If you're not able to make both your user base and your income grow exponentially, I'd suggest you seriously consider pursuing a different start-up idea.  You may be able to achieve the creation of a lifestyle business (one that would pay you a reasonable salary - $150K USD/yr) with just fast, but non-exponential growth at this early stage.

Rather, we're trying to make it into a useful multi-tool close in spirit to systems like Pachube, a component that coders/bloggers/site authors/whoever can drop into their projects.<p>And you're right. Semantic formats are very heavy weight. There are a lot of useful things that can be done with semi-semantic data before we achieve full linked-data across the web, if that even ever happens (you could argue for and against such visions, IMHO). Check it out at: <a href=""http://scrapmetl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scrapmetl.com/</a> and give us a shout on Twitter @Maciek416 and @corban if you're interested in playing.",1240063009

568312,comment,568218,568218,0,0,andymoe,,,"I would be interested to hear thoughts on how CouchDB would compare to Google gears from those that have worked with either. Would it make sense for Google to expand the gears API into some kind of monster that would make it easier to work with app engine or similar by only writing client side JS?<p>What about a JS lib that allows you to interact with gears as if it were CouchDB? This gets you a little wider audience since you only have to ask people to install Google gears. And what user does not trust the Google brand :)",1240062914

Who has more money after tax?<p>If the increased tax rate is applied to 100% of the income, then Bob gets more money than Alice and the system is stupid. Easier to calculate, but unfair.<p>Update: After reading the other link, i believe that the US tax system isn't stupid. Alice still has more money than Bob after taxes.",1240062883

If it weren't for the universal service requirement, the USPS could operate like the private companies. But personally, I like getting my mail no matter where I live.<p>You do the math on that universal service vs. choosing the profit maximization thing.<p>Talking about the post office's losses without citing that context is disingenuous.<p>Also, from having worked at a mailing house, I can tell the author doesn't understand much about how the post office actually routes mail.",1240061759

If you have an app that can edit SVG files, it should be generating a preview for you.  I know that doesn't help much but in short, look for a SVG preview generator, or something along those lines.<p>> SFTP/SCP support<p>Likewise, I think you need a 3rd party solution. MacFuse or Expandrive (which is basically a nice UI on MacFuse).  Pity finder doesn't handle this though, yet more insecure FTP use encouraged...<p>> ACL / old style mode changes<p>command-i, under 'sharing & permissions' gives you most of this (which you probably know), but no non-standard options like suid/sgid.  I imagine PathFinder has a nice UI for this.<p>> Nautilus style icon or text navigation pane (so I can paste a file path)<p>Not what you asking, but fyi command-shift-G does this in Finder (even has tab complete)",1240060585

I'm just as happy with less billing and no tax worries (except for the startup dream, of course)<p>I directly control how much I make, so I think I would have some personal insight into how tax rates affect small businesses.<p>But what do I know? As I understand it from my peers and the article, I should be happy to do all of that extra work to support other causes. I don't know what's wrong with me. I must be terribly selfish, assuming that I should work for me and my family instead of the collective good.<p>Funny that I don't feel that selfish.",1240060113

She is merciless on my ego.<p>But there's something to be said for fitting in, going with the flow, taking things as they happen. That's not to say to act dumb, just being in the moment at a rock concert probably isn't going to elicit Shakespearean quotes. There's a fine line between being smart and <i>acting</i> smart. Appearing smart is not necessarily a desirably externalized attribute in all social situations.",1240059853

568292,comment,568158,568158,0,0,smoody,,,"A quick question:<p>Is it or is it not the case that the higher tax rate is only applied to income <i>over</i> the $250K threshold? So, if you make $260K, then only $10K would be taxed at the higher rate and the rest would be taxed at the lower rate. Or is it that 100% of the income gets taxed at the higher rate? I've heard it argued both ways.<p>The majority of the people out there seem to think it's the latter, but the people who believe it's the former, though fewer in number, are very passionate. I always tend to believe the few-but-passionate over the general consensus when it comes to issues that are glossed-over in the press.",1240059642

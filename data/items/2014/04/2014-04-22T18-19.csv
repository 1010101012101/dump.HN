In any case, foobar2000&#x27;s support for HTTPS streaming is lousy ranging to unusable; specifically, there is no mechanism, including the Windows CA certificate store, by which foobar2000 can be induced to accept a self-signed certificate as valid. When you can&#x27;t stream music from home over your Comcast circuit without getting throttled because Comcast assumes MP3 data going upstream means BitTorrent, this poses a problem.<p>There&#x27;s also the problem of the playback queue not working the way it should. In theory, a playback queue is to a playlist as a lambda is to a named function; in practice, when foobar2000 reaches the end of a queue, it blithely continues playing tracks off the playlist whence came the last item in the queue, which is frankly ridiculous. I can understand from an implementation perspective why it works that way, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less broken.<p>These are the reasons why I&#x27;m looking for a better music player. I wish I had any hope of ever finding one.",1398193009

I don&#x27;t deny it, but I&#x27;m not sure. While Snowden is some &quot;justice warrior&quot; fighting over the <i>idea</i> who is obviously not welcome in the USA, Durov is much more prosaic person. I mean, he may have some ideas and moral principles he can&#x27;t neglect, but he is a businessman, clever guy prone to dramatic performances and, honestly, quite a weasel himself. And it&#x27;s not even clear if he has reasons to be hated by some secret sovernment agents or something as Snowden is. He is not an owner and not even an employee of Vk anymore.  He does&#x27;t claim to know some government secrets or anything. And while it&#x27;s possible (<i>likely</i>, actually) that he was forced to get rid of stocks, his company wasn&#x27;t really &quot;taken&quot; from him. I mean, he sold it, he got his money, he didn&#x27;t suddenly disappear and wasn&#x27;t taken to jail like Khodorkovsky, when there possibly were reasons for that. And now he has nothing to do with Vk, and there&#x27;re claims that he wasn&#x27;t even forced to quit. Weird, huh.<p>So I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s quite a probability of that thing being just another spectacle.",1398192927

Please bear with me...<p><pre><code>  What I am seeing is that we have a ridiculously upside-down trust\n  model -- &quot;Trust the developers&quot;.\n\n  We never asked for people to trust us.  We might have &quot;earned some&quot; in\n  some people&#x27;s eyes, but if so it has always been false, even before\n  this.  People should trust what they test, but the world has become\n  incredibly lazy.\n\n  We build this stuff by trusting each other as friends, and that is\n  done on an international level.  If anything, the layers and volume of\n  trust involved in software development should decrease trust. Oh\n  right, let&#x27;s hear some of that &quot;many eyes&quot; crap again.  [..]  All the\n  many eyes are apparently attached to a lot of hands that type lots of\n  words about many eyes, and never actually audit code. \n\n  If anything, the collaborative model we use should _decrease_ trust,\n  [..]\n</code></pre>\nBefore anyone gets the wrong idea, I&#x27;m not trying to attack any individual here.  But so many software vulnerabilities, goto fail included, Heartbleed included, have caused such angry response from people.  That the bug was trivial.  It should&#x27;ve been caught by static analysis, smart compilers, correct review process, careful third party readers, TDD, UFOs, ADHD, <insert favorite tech here>.  It is easy to say all that in hindsight, because you are for most part right.  So why weren&#x27;t these techniques used?<p>You can&#x27;t blame the developers for everything, they have work on their hands and you are not entitled to anything more from them.  You also can&#x27;t trust developers.  If there&#x27;s sloppy code, someone has to notice it and point it out.  Someone has to fix it.  If there are sloppy development practices and it is evident that the upstream developers do not care, someone has to notice that and let the world know.  Then maybe create a fork and try to do better.<p>So anyone capable of reviewing code and diffs: please try to do it if you haven&#x27;t before.  Try to do more if you&#x27;re already doing it.  And remeber, you do not have to be an expert programmer to notice a duplicated goto fail line.<p>Or if you can write tests, why don&#x27;t you contribute?<p>[quote] <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=129261032213320&w=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=129261032213320&w=2</a>",1398192913

Modern civil engineering technology has solved this in many contexts.<p>Actually, I think social solutions to the social problem here are far older than modern civil engineering technology -- the <i>technical</i> problem is that, even with the <i>social</i> factors addressed, there stop being viable alternatives when you have large numbers of people packed in close quarters <i>without</i> sufficient technical means to separate waste streams from supply streams. Modern civil engineering solves that technical problem, allowing the social solutions to be effective in conditions where they otherwise would not be.<p>OTOH, technical solutions to, e.g., food production and distribution problems (which the world has many of) don&#x27;t work when the social infrastructure is not in place to support them (which is why people starve in a world with plenty of food.)<p>Lots of things that are <i>described</i> as single problems have both technical and social aspects, and addressing one doesn&#x27;t resolve the other.

Person A finds a ticket, tells his closest buddies so they can find them. Before it&#x27;s made public knowledge that this happened, all of A and his friends and their friends have tickets. I don&#x27;t see this as a particularly &quot;good&quot; approach. Why not just randomly pick several developers from GitHub/Google Code and say &quot;here are 10 tickets, give them to your friends&quot;?<p>I&#x27;d much rather a scavenger hunt be announced and all-inclusive of the community. I don&#x27;t see how this is any better than FCFS or lottery. In fact, the lottery might be the worst of all. It&#x27;s more likely to be diluted by non-technical people and encourages gaming by having as many employees sign up as possible in any given company, since there&#x27;s no cost to register.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what Google&#x27;s goal is with I/O attendance.<p>Is this not one of the most technical conferences of the year? Highly technical talks and sessions for developers by developers. Looking over the talks at 2013 (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions</a>, non-versioned link, so this might point at the 2014 sessions if your&#x27;e reading this in the future), everything seems to be developer oriented.<p>Why, then, doesn&#x27;t participation require the ability to do something like complete a few simple randomized programming challenges to prove you&#x27;re capable of benefiting from attendance? Google runs Code Jam, they easily have the infrastructure to do this on the scale that is needed for I/O. It&#x27;s also certainly not necessary that <i>every</i> seat be given out this way, but why not 70-90%?<p>I&#x27;m happy that they put <i>everything</i> on YouTube and live stream the talks, so I (and everyone else who doesn&#x27;t win the lottery) can still benefit, but if people are trying to get tickets just to get the toys Google gives out to attendees, I feel like there needs to be much more thought put into the selection process, or Google should just sell those outright to any developer who wants them. I really hate trying to saturate conference attendance by giving out exclusive toys, or toys ahead of market. It typically attracts the wrong people for the wrong reasons.",1398192837

This says absolutely nothing about whether the standard of living of the poorest will improve or decline.</i><p>I believe you are making the same mistake as the Bloomberg reviewer in separating inequality from the fate of the poorest.<p>To see the connection, you have to look deeper. That is, you must consider the <i>causes</i> of inequality that Piketty offers. You might argue that inequality in itself doesn&#x27;t produce a negative outcome for the poorest, but that the <i>causes</i> of our current inequality produce those negative outcomes as a side effect. I would say that&#x27;s semantics, but in any case, what Piketty lays out does support the notion of a rising inequality along with a comcomitant stagnation/slippage for the poorest/others.<p>So, let&#x27;s say it the other way, if you prefer: some of the primary reasons (increased productivity, automation, etc.) for the rate of wealth-accumulation for the rich that we&#x27;re seeing also produces negative outcomes for the poorest (unemployment, downward wage pressure, etc.). This has led us to (or, rather, is by definition) the growing inequality that we&#x27;re seeing.<p>Finally, these arguments of the ilk that &quot;inequality must be OK because the standard of living for the poor has risen even in the face of historical inequality&quot; fall flat. It really is  a false equivalence.<p>Firstly, such arguments imply that degree is irrelevant and that <i>no</i> degree of inequality would produce (or represent) a negative outcome for the poor. In fact, there is some point at which capture by one party must come at the expense of others to the extent that the latter parties slip backwards. Secondly--and to the first point--Piketty outlines that the degree of inequality was historically kept in check by various forces in other examples where the outcomes for the poor weren&#x27;t detrimental.<p>In those cases, the threshold for negative outcomes was simply not crossed. However, this is certainly not proof that they cannot be.",1398192498

7629544,comment,7629177,7629177,33,0,GuiA,,,"Congrats! This is fantastic.<p>If you can write code, I highly recommend taking a stab at writing yourself the tools that you use the most (whether that is a music player, chat client, text editor, etc.).<p>Sure, it isn&#x27;t trivial - but modern languages and libraries (I&#x27;m a big fan of Python, both for the language and its ecosystem) make it a very reasonable project. You can get an MVP working in a few weeks of work (if you spend 5-10 hours a week on it), and then you can add features and tweak the thing over the months and years as you use it.<p>And in the end, you get a piece of software that you deeply know, to which you can add any feature you want, that is customized to fit perfectly in your workflow, etc. It&#x27;s a bit of work, but it&#x27;s really cool and IMO one of the neatest things you can do for yourself as a programmer. Additionally, if it&#x27;s something that works well for you, chances are that other people will like it- open sourcing it and getting other people to use it is a high of its own.<p>I&#x27;m working on a few such apps myself (todo list, mail client, and a few others), as console applications using ncurses to make something with a responsive, smart, effective and efficient style of UI that I don&#x27;t think has been done before (mostly because no one has been trying to innovate in the domain of console applications in the past 20 years- but I think interesting things can be done). When I&#x27;m at an interesting point, I&#x27;ll open source it and write a few posts about it.<p>I hear the naysayers saying that it&#x27;s a waste of time, that there are already 8000 different open source mail clients and music players and todo lists apps and that it&#x27;s better to contribute to old open source projects than create your own, etc... those arguments aren&#x27;t wrong, but IMO they don&#x27;t outweigh the pros I outlined above.<p>This talk by Gary Bernhardt is relevant: <a href=""https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world</a>",1398192423

It&#x27;s not for hardcore cryptographic applications, you can&#x27;t choose specific ciphers and it makes no effort to ensure plausible deniability.<p>Safe&#x27;s main goal is to make file system encryption easy to use and accessible to more people. It&#x27;s for every day encryption i.e. a simple way to ensure reasonably private stuff is actually stored privately. Peace of mind if your laptop or external hard gets stolen, or someone hacks into your backup service. As a tool, it empowers more people to make their own cryptography decisions instead of having to rely on and trust proprietary solutions.<p>Safe isn&#x27;t without limitations. Think of it like the physical safe you keep in your home: burglars will have a hard time cracking it but given enough resources it&#x27;s not strictly impenetrable. If you need a steel alloy vault, TrueCrypt might be closer to what you&#x27;re looking for but it&#x27;s not without its own set of limitations as well.<p>Personally I store all my tax, legal, and medical documents in Safe. That&#x27;s just me, Safe is GPL and comes with no warranty :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://pastebin.com/xxQhEv0q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/xxQhEv0q</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://twitter.com/safe_app/statuses/457281727761620992"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/safe_app/statuses/457281727761620992</a>",1398191674

7629434,comment,7628604,7629302,7,0,lrichardson,,,"Yes and no.<p>Some of this is that JavaScript is just not very well equipped to do functional programming. For instance, the nesting of functions in JavaScript is not only verbose to write, it also introduces a lot of noise in the code.<p>One pretty simple/obvious setback for JavaScript is that declaring an anonymous function (or a lambda) entails quite a few characters. In ES6, [this will change with the introduction of &quot;Arrow Functions&quot;][2], but that&#x27;s not going to be a cure-all by any means.<p>Languages geared more towards the functional edge will handle things like curried higher order functions almost without you realizing it.  For instance, taking an excerpt from my next post in the series (still unpublished):<p><pre><code>    var uncurried = function (a, b, c) {\n        // do something with a, b, and c\n    };\n\n    var curried = function(a) {\n        return function (b) {\n            return function (c) {\n                // do something with a, b, and c\n            };\n        };\n    };\n</code></pre>\nThere we have two ternary functions (3 arguments), but the first one is uncurried (how you would expect it in javascript), and the second one is manually written in a curried fashion.<p>Some programming languages, such as Haskell and OCaml, have function currying built into the language. What that means is that, technically, <i></i>every function is a function of one argument, and one argument only<i></i>. Syntactically, however, they may make this restriction almost unnoticable.<p>For instance, in OCaml, one could write the two functions above like:<p><pre><code>    let uncurried = fun a b c ->\n        // (* do something with a, b, c *)\n\n    let curried = fun a ->\n        fun b ->\n            fun c ->\n                // (* do something with a, b, c *)\n</code></pre>\nThe difference, however, is that in OCaml these are <i>exactly</i> the same thing. In OCaml, no functions have multiple arguments. However, invoking curried functions syntactically looks the same as what one would expect invoking a function with multiple arguments would be.  To call the functions above we would write:<p><pre><code>    uncurried foo bar baz\n    curried foo bar baz\n</code></pre>\nWhereas in JavaScript, we have the obvious difference:<p><pre><code>    uncurried(foo, bar, baz);\n    curried(foo)(bar)(baz);\n</code></pre>\nMany would argue that the readability of the former is much better than the latter.<p>---<p>Anyway, what I am trying to build up to in this series is building a set of tools to make writing code like this a little more fluid in JavaScript than native JavaScript would allow.<p>This goes back to my example in [Part 1][1], where I show an underscore example:<p><pre><code>    var firstTwoLetters = function(words){\n        return _.map(words, function(word){\n            return _.first(word, 2);\n        });\n    };\n</code></pre>\nWhich, the <i>exact</i> same thing can be represented &quot;my way&quot; with:<p><pre><code>    var firstTwoLetters = map(first(2));\n</code></pre>\nI would argue that this is much more readable, and perhaps you would agree?<p><pre><code>  [1]: http://tech.pro/tutorial/1953/functional-javascript-part-1-introduction\n  [2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/arrow_functions</code></pre>",1398191297

Go&#x27;s standard json library usually recommends that you define a struct type to hold the result of the decode, tagging field names with the `json` annotation.  This obviously doesn&#x27;t work when you only care about a few dozen of the several thousand possible fields.  There is fortunately an escape hatch where you can declare a field as interface{} to say &quot;Any type of data goes here; I&#x27;ll downcast it later, and just trust me on the type&quot;, but then you have to litter your code with downcasts.<p>Python just hands you back a dict of lists, and you pull out the information you want, no type declarations needed.<p>The &quot;user-defined types like built-ins&quot; lets you build libraries where you can use the basic language structures on the data structure itself, without having to convert to an intermediate form.  For example, the Python bindings to Amazon S3 let you access files through dictionary notation.  BeautifulSoup lets you iterate over child nodes with a for loop, or access attributes as a dict.  NumPy lets you use standard arithmetic operators on matrices.  Judicious use of this in libraries makes the resulting code much briefer.",1398190598

Suppose you&#x27;ve written a function &#x27;foo&#x27; in your language that does something useful (e.g.: partitions a sequence, validates a map, or pretty much anything really).<p>2. Some time later you want to write a macro &#x27;bar&#x27;.<p>3. Can you use function &#x27;foo&#x27; when writing &#x27;bar&#x27;?<p>If the answer to 3 is &quot;no&quot; then you don&#x27;t really have Lisp-like macros.<p>This is what makes Lisp macros so powerful.  It&#x27;s not just that you have a way to mangle abstract syntax trees.  If that&#x27;s all you want then yeah, you can write a parser and template language to do it, like this thing or sweet js, but it&#x27;s not the same.<p>Lisp macros are beautiful because there&#x27;s no real divide between &quot;writing code&quot; and &quot;writing macros&quot;.  It&#x27;s all just code.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about which things are available in code-land and which are available in macro-land because <i>they&#x27;re the same place</i>.  There&#x27;s just &quot;the language&quot; which you extend and mold with functions and macros woven together as necessary.<p>Contrast this with a language without real Lisp-like macros, like Clojurescript.  If I want to write the &#x27;bar&#x27; macro in Clojurescript I need to think &quot;wait &#x27;foo&#x27; is a Clojurescript function so now I need to port it back into Clojure land before I can use it in this macro because macros in Clojurescript live in Clojure-land not Clojurescript-land&quot;.  I need to think about this for everything I call inside a macro.<p>(Admittedly the situation isn&#x27;t as bad in Clojurescript because it&#x27;s fairly close to Clojure in syntax and it&#x27;s possible to cross-compile code so it lives in both &quot;lands&quot;, but the ugly divide is still there.)<p>Common Lisp, Clojure, Scheme, Wisp, Julia, etc have Lisp-like macros.

I&#x27;m also a hacker, and am excited about the way that tech is being used in microfinance and crowdfunding.  I think this stuff could have a big impact on the developing world, which is why I started this blog last month.  I&#x27;m slowly working my way through the topics listed here, some of which I hope will be of interest to HN readers:<p><a href=""http://modernmicrocredit.blogspot.com/2014/03/modern-microcredit-covering-trends-in.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modernmicrocredit.blogspot.com/2014/03/modern-microcr...</a><p>Zidisha just happened to be the first topic I started with.  My next article is going to be about revenue models in crowdfunding.  Some companies are using some dark design patterns in their revenue models, and I plan to cover that as well:<p><a href=""http://modernmicrocredit.blogspot.com/2014/04/revenue-models-in-crowdfunding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modernmicrocredit.blogspot.com/2014/04/revenue-models...</a><p>As I mention in the introduction to my article, I wasn&#x27;t planning on writing a followup on Zidisha.  But then you responded to my last article by dramatically lowering your interest rates.  So I wrote a followup covering what that meant for lenders.<p>Like I said in the article, Zidisha shows a lot of promise, and I very much want the concept to succeed. But to do that, I think you need to start being more transparent about the problem you have with high loan loss rates.\n \nI would love to see a long response from you regarding the article. I&#x27;d be happy to publish your response in the comments of my article, or even in the article itself.  If you have any corrections, I&#x27;d be glad to publish those as well.",1398189652

In my final version above, I have assumed copying a range is cheap, and copying a Drawable is expensive and unnecessary... seems perfect to me, and it will not compile passing a vector of unique_ptr&#x27;s, which is what I would want",1398189649

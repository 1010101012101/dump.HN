3697567,comment,3697030,3697030,10,0,jacobolus,,,"This is silly.<p>> <i>Usually, high religious observance and low income go along with high birthrates</i><p>No, usually what goes along with high birthrates is an agrarian peasant society that has to maintain high birthrates because 50%+ of children die before the age of 5, and if you want to have several kids of working age around to help in the fields, you need to aim for 8 or 12 newborns. Agrarian peasant societies happen to be poor and religious, but those are effects, not causes. Other contributing factors: women without independent income and therefore beholden to their husbands, no access to contraceptives, lack of basic literacy and education especially among girls.<p>Then what happens when places get improved sanitation and healthcare, pretty consistently everywhere we look at the data, is that theres a demographic bubble when a generation has mothers survive all their pregnancies and all their 8-12 kids survive to adulthood. Then in the next generation or two, that falls to 4-6 kids on average because, hey, 50% arent dying anymore. Then by 2-3 generations after that, its down to 2-3 kids on average, or in some places even below replacement levels. Other contributing factors: migration to cities, access to contraceptives, and education especially of girls.<p>If you work in a factory or an office or a store, and live in a city, its just not convenient to start having kids at age 16 or to end up with 8 kids running around, even if youre poor or religious. Already, 50% of the world population is urban, and within another generation that will be 60%.<p>> <i>The speed of the change is breathtaking</i><p>The same demographic changes everywhere else in the world happened or are happening roughly at the same speed. Theres an incredible drop in fertility rate within 2-3 generations every time. For example, you see precisely the same pattern happening within the last few decades in rural Mexico, and if you look back several generations, the same pattern sweeping across Europe.<p>That Brooks thinks the changes in Oman &c. are surprising says more about Brooks than about the changes here.",1331629022

We are missing a good investment model for successful tech/web businesses that aren't the huge windfalls VCs want, like most businesses in other fields. You could say that angel investment is that model - the problem is that VCs <i>want</i> to invest in many companies, and it's sometimes hard to reject their offer. Once you do take their money, it's hard justifying slow growth and good though less-than-stellar success, and in that case, both the company and its users are ""doomed"".<p>And why do VCs want to invest in so many companies?

3697509,comment,3697030,3697422,7,0,nkoren,,,"> Why is this true?<p>Because of something called the ""Dependency Ratio"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_ratio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_ratio</a><p>The basic concept is that in order for there to be a high quality of life for most people in a society, the majority of  them need to be capable of doing economically productive work. Otherwise you have a large number of dependents (juveniles and/or retirees) whose sustenance must somehow be garnered from a relatively small number of workers.<p>In China, for example, demographers talk about the ""4:2:1 generation"", which is the long-term effect of improving longevity combined with the one-child policy. This means that there could be four retired grandparents and two retired parents to every one working individual. Somehow, the social services for six people would have to be supported off the tax revenue from one. That's just not possible, and could very easily lead to a bad outcome for society as a whole.<p>(This isn't to discount the problems that come from overpopulation -- I'm just pointing out that it cuts both ways).<p>Too-rapid population growth can also lead to high dependency ratios -- in the form of children rather than the elderly -- and this also makes it difficult/impossible to support adequate social programmes. Historically, the best-performing economies tend to be those with very low dependency ratios, which is typically the result of a baby boom that is quickly followed by a baby bust. That produces a bulge of economically productive workers, the revenue from which can be spent on things like infrastructure and investment rather than social-support programmes which have less of an impact on GDP.<p>(Incidentally, this is a large part of the reason why China is going so bonkers with infrastructure development, building high-speed rail and ghost cities for which there is arguably no market. They're doing this because now is the only time they <i>can</i>. In 15 years, China as a whole will be substantially wealthier -- with enough people who are genuinely able to afford high-end condominiums and high-speed rail -- but at that point their youth bulge will be gone, scarcity of labour will drive up wages, most government revenue will have to go to healthcare and social services, and they'll have no ability build that kind of infrastructure. So they're building it while they can, well in advance of their actual need for it, which is actually pretty damn clever.)",1331627324

3697485,comment,3695546,3697420,4,0,drostie,,,"No. Copyright is always fundamentally a legal discussion. Everyday copying doesn't have deep ethical ramifications, because the most everyday copying we do is called 'memory' and remembering something is almost never unethical. And ethics is the only branch of philosophy which really has a voice in the matter -- copyright is not epistemic or ontological, etc. I would go so far as to say that the utter absence of a moral intuition against copying is why the vast majority of people do it and don't have a problem with it.<p>The people who do seem to be responding to some sort of intuition of this form: ""a free lunch is unfair."" It's not, as we'd say, unfair to you, and not even to the copyright holders necessarily, but something about a free lunch just <i>looks suspicious</i>. So the first comment in this thread says that whether Joe Blow's actions are unfair ""comes down to how much Joe Blow WOULD have paid for avatar.mp4."" You saw that he would have paid for X but instead he got it for free, and you said ""man, there's something unfair here.""<p>It may sometimes be useful to regulate things which our ethical intuitions don't speak very strongly about. Our ethical intuitions don't speak very strongly about living in a messy room; a boarding school might nonetheless demand that its students keep their rooms clean. (I have heard a cute theory that we lack this intuition because our primate ancestors lived in trees and therefore literally did not have to handle their own crap.) Seatbelt laws, licensing drivers, and regulating CO2 emissions would also fit into the same category. So ""who has the right to copy this book?"" can still be a valid question, even when that book is a .pdf and our relevant moral intuitions instead say, ""hey, I'm just giving the book I bought to a friend -- that's within my rights as a person who bought the book."" That moral intuition, even if you have it, doesn't necessarily obviate the potential social value of that law.",1331626767

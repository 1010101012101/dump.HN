Instagram also sells Nostalgia and has a <i>huge</i> user base.<p>If you haven't seen it before, take a moment to watch this clip from an American television show called Mad Men.

It's also true.<p>It's IE9 with IE10's substandard HTML, JS and CSS stuff shoehorned in. That doesn't even make for a better IE9, it makes for a completely different beast of a browser.<p>Realistically, I'm only ever going to use it to browser test, so for me and possibly everyone else here on HN, the most important feature is going to be the developer tools. And in this version of IE What's not to like?<p>Everything. That's what. All it's good for is checking the console, but even then it's like having your debugging info spoken to you by a special needs kid with a lisp. Objects are still just the ever useless [object Object]. Minor javascript errors are enough to send it into a tailspin, followed up by an inevitable crash. I still don't understand why the console displays line numbers as links when clicking them does nothing. Profiler and Network, yeah, they do their job ok-ish, but they do the bare minimum.<p>Also, I wonder: when they had the meeting at Microsoft to decide what to call the ""disable cache"" option, which bight spark suggested ""Always refresh from server"" would be the best label to properly convey the feature. Probably the same bright spark who decided to make it do absolutely nothing so you still have to empty the cache every fucking time anyway.<p>My rating: 0/10. As far as I can tell, there's not one single aspect of it that's in any way better than anything the competition offers. Zero ""things"" that could earn it even a solitary point.<p>I'm sick to the back teeth of IE and it's bullshit.

4783513,comment,4781894,4783260,1,0,klibertp,,,"First you said that these languages are 'OO'. Confronted with evidence that, in fact, they are multi-paradigm languages and that includes functional style you changed your argument.<p>Now you're saying that those languages are not functional, because all the main datastructures in them are implemented as objects. Well, object models of JavaScript, Python and Ruby are vastly different and so I have to infer very wide definition of an object - that of data+methods - because there is nothing more that all three languages agree on in case of objects.<p>I have to tell you this - this kind of objects is not unique to OOP. The only difference between C, for example, and Python in this respect is that you call ""methods"" like this:<p><pre><code>    list_append(my_list, my_element);
</code></pre>
instead of<p><pre><code>    my_list.append(my_element) # but note that you can write like this too:
    list.append(my_list, my_element)
</code></pre>
My point is that every datastructure is an object. Every datastructure has some data (internal representation) and methods operating on them. LinkedList or HashTable is going to be an object no matter which notation you use to access them.<p>There is more to OOP than just objects, of course, but that does not matter. You can program in functional style using your language built-in objects without any problem at all. Take a look at PowerShell, for example of something even more exotic: turns out you can program in purely procedular language while using objects from .NET framework. On the other hand, there are bindings to wxWindow for Erlang; turns out you can program in purely (as in 'not supporting other paradigms'!) functional language using objects too.<p>I don't really know what you're trying to say, but JavaScript, Python and Ruby are perfectly capable of functional programming and can be used as languages supporting functional style. There is really no counterargument for this - or at least the fact that operations on main datastructures of these languages are implemented with syntactic sugar is not one.",1352904465

It's call-by-value, the confusion comes from what, in Python, is considered a value (and when a value is mutable, which is always (with a little ctypes magic), even the built-in number 4). And just like in Java, which also is always call-by-value, Python passes pointers-by-value under the hood which allows for some easy modification.<p>There is an easy test to see if a language supports call-by-reference or not:<p><pre><code>    a = 3
    b = 4
    swap(a,b)
    print a, b # 4 3
</code></pre>
C++ can do this, C can't, C# can't (if you think it can, then so can C), Python can't, Java can't. Therefore, all of those but C++ are call-by-value in all cases.<p>Edit: I hasten to add, the swap() function should be implemented ""traditionally"". i.e.:<p><pre><code>    def swap(x, y):

      y = temp</code></pre>",1352902878

4783380,comment,4781894,4783253,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"The problem with the mutability debate is that most examples show two programs, one mutable and one immutable, on the scale of about 20 lines of code. At the small scale, it's a toss-up which is better. Often the mutable solution's more intuitive for most programmers, and sometimes just flat-out superior: more clear, easier to understand. Mutable state isn't evil. It's necessary in the real world. It's just that stateful actions don't compose well, especially when you involve concurrency or Big Code problems. Good programmers learn that they need to <i>manage</i> (not eliminate) mutable state. That's what FP is about.<p>So the aesthetic dominance that FP advocates hope to establish with their 20-line A/B depictions doesn't come through, because the truth is that the problems with mutable state very rarely show up (except in contrived, over-complex examples) at 20 LoC. At 20 LoC, the snippet you'll like better is going to be the one you're most familiar with. The real differences show up at 2000 LoC, which can't be put in a PowerPoint.<p>Immutable programming is somewhat less prone (but not immune) to complexity creep. For example, you see 500-line for-loops in corporate software all the time. The conceptual integrity is gone because so many people (who never learned what the others were doing) have added tweaks to it.<p>The difference between mutable and immutable programming is that making that sort of change to an immutable program also changes the API, unless it's purely a performance tweak (e.g. plus(2, 2) still returns 4, but does it faster). If you add logging to plus in a purely functional world, you change its signature from (Int, Int) => Int to something like (Int, Int) => (Int, String). As you might guess, that's a double-edged sword. Sometimes you want people to be able to add ""purely stateful"" (i.e. no API changes) effects without changing a signature... but very rarely.<p>So I think the major upshot of immutable programming is that it makes it impossible to add many varieties of complexity that corporate engineers tend to add silently (in pursuit of a short-term hack) without changing an API and breaking the build. This slows down complexity creep, and that's a good thing.<p>It's the reduction of that externalized-cost/complexity-creep dynamic that makes FP superior, in my opinion. A 60-line referentially transparent function really isn't less evil than a 60-line method of an object. They're both fucking incomprehensible, in most cases. You're just less likely to see the 60-liner in a mature FP codebase. Also, because functions compose better than stateful actions, it's usually a lot easier to break large functions up long before they get anywhere near 60 lines. (In my opinion, double-digits are ""warning"" territory and 25+ lines means it should almost always be split, at least into inner functions.)",1352902792

In some cases, they just seem like the most user-friendly option.<p>Although for bindings they are more difficult, using callbacks can be great when binding to higher-level languages, where the user can specify what should happen using a short lambda function (e.g. Python, etc.)  A switch statement or whatever is much more obnoxious in those cases, so what other solutions are there?",1352902665

a) cheap labor
b) well-understood technology
c) ability to fallback to expert knowledge<p>grew up with object-oriented paradigms.<p>Since OOP frameworks removed many low-level coding tasks, the cost of entrance into the labor market allowed the labor pool to be flooded with developers, it helped that demand was so high and investors so hungry that proof-of-concepts often became products.<p>What came out of all this is that OOP matured, but OOA and OOD didn't keep pace as market demanded disciplines. What you see today is many OO systems that were not analyzed or designed by architects who were good analysts and designers, but who understood OOP and had access to a pattern-book.<p>But, taking a page from category theory, we could abstract OO from OOP, OOA and OOD, and should be able to easily see that the same could eventually apply to FP, FA and FD should the bell-curve of talent fill out due to market demand.",1352902577

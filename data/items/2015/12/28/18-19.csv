10802516,comment,10797133,10801938,0,0,zeveb,,,"> I embraced OS X as soon as it was available and have never looked back.<p>I used the original Mac OS from 1984-2000. I&#x27;ve used Windows since before 1995 until earlier this year. I&#x27;ve used Linux since 1998. I&#x27;ve used Mac OS X every once in awhile when using other folks&#x27; computers.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know why someone who&#x27;s comfortable on the command line (and doesn&#x27;t need certain proprietary desktop-publishing programs) would use Mac OS X (or Windows). It doesn&#x27;t give me a decent window manager. It doesn&#x27;t let me keep my hands on my keyboard (right now, my mouse is almost two feet from my hand, and yet I&#x27;m completely happy and able to get around as I need). It doesn&#x27;t use screen space very well. It&#x27;s not free. Where having the menubar atop the screen was a good design decision in 1984 with a monitor a few inches tall, it&#x27;s a horrible choice on a modern large screen: I spend so much time moving the mouse that I spend very little time actually <i>using</i> the computer, rather than moving-and-reading. It certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like a well-designed, well-integrated whole: it feels like a colossal heap of mystery meat navigation, where nothing is obvious or intuitive, things bounce and slide for no apparent reason and I can&#x27;t just get my work done.<p>I get that for certain desktop publishing tasks it&#x27;s superior, and that if one wants proprietary software then it&#x27;s a friendlier alternative to Windows (which is the obvious best choice if one wants proprietary software support). But other than that, why pay extra for a Mac? A modern Linux has terminals, web browsers and editors; sound and graphics are not the pain they were in the 90s; what else does one need than a command line, a web browser, a decent editor and some music?",1451327214

In the West, Descartes famously declared animals are automata. Safina shares this quote from Voltaire in response:<p>```\nVoltaire disdainfully called out Descartes’s contradictions of logic, even referring to him and his followers as “barbarians”: “What a pitiful, what a sorry thing to have said that animals are machines bereft of understanding and feeling,” wrote Voltaire. He continued: Is it because I speak to you, that you judge that I have feeling, memory, ideas? Well, I do not speak to you; you see me going home looking disconsolate, seeking a paper anxiously, opening the desk where I remember having shut it, finding it, reading it joyfully. You judge that I have experienced the feeling of distress and that of pleasure, that I have memory and understanding. Bring the same judgment to bear on this dog which has lost its master, which has sought him on every road with sorrowful cries, which enters the house agitated, uneasy, which goes down the stairs, up the stairs, from room to room, which at last finds in his study the master it loves, and which shows him its joy by its cries of delight, by its leaps, by its caresses. Barbarians seize this dog, which in friendship surpasses man so prodigiously; they nail it on a table, and they dissect it alive in order to show the mesenteric veins. You discover in it all the same organs of feeling that are in yourself. Answer me, machinist, has nature arranged all the means of feeling in this animal, so that it may not feel? Has it nerves in order to be impassible? Do not suppose this impertinent contradiction in nature.<p>Safina, Carl (2015-07-14). Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel (pp. 79-80).

A crossing guard&#x27;s blinking red light can be invisible in some times of day/year, and at night everything that isn&#x27;t well lit is just some shade of shadow, which looks an awful lot like unoccupied air. For the avoidance systems, I think we&#x27;re really going to net win on that, since they&#x27;ll need to see things that aren&#x27;t well illuminated, like fallen trees and ditches.

We want humans to shine, like there&#x27;s an OLED display overlay pointing at people or like a thermal imager behind walls. Reflective paint does that really well - at least it makes clothing-shaped blobs hovering in mid-air - but I think the intensity is merely that car lights are bright, so the retroreflection is far brighter than the little LED lights people tend to buy. You need something that a motor vehicle driver considers conspicuous, which is going to be something with the lumen output of a head light or brake light. In the video you linked, the bike&#x27;s red tail light really isn&#x27;t really bright enough, but the jacket absolutely is unmistakable. And blinking things really are great, since movement catches attention nicely (so long as bright-vs-dim has enough contrast).

By including this one statement you made me think you are part of the nationalistic right.<p>Sweden&#x27;s &quot;rape epidemic&quot; is mostly because other countries under-report rape. If a woman comes to the police and say that her husband had raped her almost every day for a year, then that&#x27;s 300+ rape reports. Other countries might report that as a single rape report, or declare outright that it&#x27;s impossible for a husband to rape his wife.<p>See for examples <a href=""http://www.geocurrents.info/geography-of-crime-and-punishment/misleading-murder-and-rape-maps-and-the-the-sweden-rape-puzzle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geocurrents.info/geography-of-crime-and-punishmen...</a> and <a href=""http://www.bad-housekeeping.com/2013/12/01/sweden-gender-paradise-or-capital-of-rape/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bad-housekeeping.com/2013/12/01/sweden-gender-par...</a> .<p>There are certainly people who argue that this isn&#x27;t true, but that analysis is not simple, while you argue that it&#x27;s &quot;not difficult&quot;.",1451326028

Medical professionals are no more immune to this trend of lunacy than are any other people.<p>I agree that there are too many asinine reasons for being placed on the lists. Who is to blame for that? The lawmakers? The people who elected simpletons? The people who&#x27;d rather leave a sexual sadist locked in cage forever? Certainly not those who&#x27;d as soon have such a being immediately hung after sentencing.<p>If there was as cure them, a way to prevent it from happening, I&#x27;d be happy. But this is why there are so many no-go zones for sexual offenders.

The human body is pretty good at not wasting calories, and there&#x27;s no way to double or triple your base metabolism like you&#x27;re describing.  My guess is you&#x27;re measuring water weight, and confusing dehydration with weight loss.  Maybe you ate a whole bunch of salty food and your body had to use a bunch of water to flush it out.  The fact that you lost 43 pounds is telling, it means you were at least that much overweight to begin with, so the fluctuation day to day is going to be quite large.  Once you get into shape enough to consider yourself an athlete, no way you can eat like that and not gain weight, unless you have the muscle mass of Michael Phelps, and spend as much time as him training too.  Hiking up and down Mount Washington, for example, is going to burn maybe 5000 calories, assuming you don&#x27;t eat <i>anything</i> on the way up or down and drink only water.  But you can&#x27;t hike Mt Washington every day and keep your knees and your job.  So you can&#x27;t possibly need that many calories.",1451325997

5917273,comment,5917237,5917237,15,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I used to be a heavy stackoverflow user in the early days, and I have enough karma to put me in the moderator tier now. However, I don&#x27;t use the site much anymore, except for getting questions answered.<p>In a way I suppose that&#x27;s a testament to the fact that the site still works, and works well. They solved most of the problem they set out to solve originally, which is a major achievement. Nevertheless, I still have a nagging feeling that some further iterative improvements could turn stackoverflow into something that would be even more useful, and would be more inviting for people to continue to participate in actively even without having expert knowledge in some tiny sub-category or a desire to constantly tidy everything up day-in day-out.<p>Edit: to clarify I mean that it&#x27;s hard to visit stackoverflow on a regular basis instead of just using it as an answer generating machine. Which I think is something not unique to myself and probably hurts the overall quality of the site considerably, notwithstanding the many experts who use the site heavily. Specifically I find it hard to peruse interesting topics to comment on, since the site is now very aggressively tightly focused. Even worse I find it difficult to use the site as a learning tool. Often times when I want to learn something new I&#x27;ll get it in my head to go to stackoverflow first, but that&#x27;s never worked very well for me. It&#x27;s just too difficult to sort or filter all the data into something that is actually useful.<p>Overall I think the biggest problem is that the people behind the site(s) have decided they&#x27;ve done their jobs, that what they&#x27;ve presented is good enough and at most needs only minor tweaking. I think that&#x27;s a huge mistake personally and I think the result is going to be that the stackexchange sites end up as a footnote in history after having been rapidly eclipsed by &quot;the next big thing&quot; in a similar vein.",1371807714

5917252,comment,5913135,5913135,3,0,thomasjames,,,"I think the fact that we are talking about &quot;innovation&quot; so much is a sign of an excessive degree of self-awareness. People used to be at peace with having a specific interest and true expertise and were not thinking &quot;okay, I&#x27;m smart so let me &#x27;disrupt&#x27; a market and shake things up.&quot; Many were okay with simply being a useful, necessary and perhaps not-so-widely celebrated part of a larger whole. Larger wholes like NASA, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, IBM, Bell, Digital Equipment and others that gave rise to this much lauded period of innovation (the mechanics of which the author doesn&#x27;t entirely seem to understand). It also goes without saying that the larger players in  academia were expanding in to engineering in a much more serious way due to Cold War competition.<p>Sure, there were exceptions to the theory of leviathan organizations of specialists. Intel is an exception, in that it was a start up. But it was a start up founded by people with the understanding of how a larger research entity would work (two of the main founders were established engineers at Fairchild). Talking about this sort of thing in the context of modern start-up culture, to be honest, is flippant and cheeky. Maybe &quot;idea guys&quot;, business journalists, and a lot of modern hackers in general just need to stop thinking innovation as some substance you can bottle and beating us over the heads with said bottle until the word loses all meaning. The innovators who created the sophistication of the modern transportation and energy infrastructure we now enjoy, not to mention the fundamentals of computing, were a lot humbler than the baby boomer titans of technology and probably a lot of us out there, too.",1371806692

When people buy these cars they should get the option to sign up for this service that includes a yearly cost that covers the maintenance and replacement of batteries. This way they can just let people swap batteries without worrying about getting different batteries and it also alleviates the worries about having to eventually replace all the batteries in the car. If this way is not economically feasible than Tesla is dead already, this is the only option that will make sense to consumers and Tesla needs to make it happen.",1371806057

The recurrent \ntheme permeating the petitioner&#x27;s arguments is the notion that \nthere is no foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth \nAmendment&#x27;s Warrant Clause. 6 The FISC rejected this notion, \npositing that our decision in In re Sealed Case confirmed the \nexistence of a foreign intelligence exception to the warrant \nrequirement. &quot;<p>You may want to read that again. IANAL, but as best as I can understand this is the FISC appeals court (the secret intelligence court&#x27;s appeals court) affirming its belief that while <i>law</i> - the FISA - prevents (some) no-warrant searches for &quot;foreign intelligence information&quot; on US persons, this is not actually necessary to comply with the US constitution, because the <i>Constitution</i> does not prevent such searches at all. As soon as a foreign intelligence justification exists, open Sesame! the Warrant Clause goes away and the US government can search US citizens without any warrant.

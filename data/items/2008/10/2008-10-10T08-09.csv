They're repositioning as the complete ecommerce solutions provider for small to big businesses. PayPal DOMINATES fund transfers and with their purchase of Verisign they have a big chunk of merchant accounts processing. Toss in Skype, recently BillPoint, expansion to international markets... That's not struggling.<p>Taking on eBay is outlandish.",1223627834

Voice + twitter + devices is pretty nifty.<p>Add: What's important here is that he's managed to build a system to push content to multiple mobile devices. Think about that. The application of his system can change as time goes on, but it can be really successful if he can scale it or monetize it.<p>PS: Maybe you're not that sharp.<p>PPS: That was mean, your site's freakin' awesome!",1223627265

Most startups spend lots of time developing their product, and do not find a market at the end.<p>We know there is definitely a market - the problem is that it is not easy to build a product for it, hence we are trying to re-iterate to the right product-market fit.",1223626576

I think SQLite is really eating into that quick-and-dirty db segment occupied by MySQL - while PostgreSQL is still ahead in the standard-compliant-robust-and-lot's-of-features department.",1223626463

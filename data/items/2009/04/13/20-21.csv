The funny thing is, most of the science on this issue suggests that the ""you"" that is supposedly fighting either environment or genetics...is entirely composed of environmental and genetic influences. So if there is a ""you"" that can fight environment, it's the genetic you, and vice versa.<p>And it's not like you're Mister Spock, with one half of your personality fighting a completely different half. It's more like a smoothie, where you can't tell what part is the banana, what part is the strawberry, and so forth, except it tastes like a mixture of both.

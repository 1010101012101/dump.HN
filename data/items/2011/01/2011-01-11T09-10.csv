And I have no problem with them being the highest paid person in the company, even by several times.  I just think the vast majority are ridiculously over paid.<p>>But, the OP also seems to be making the mistake of implying CEOs == the rich.<p>No, I was singling this group out as a big source of inequality.  Larry and Sergei are founders.  Their wealth (initially) didn't negatively impact anyone else.  Michael Jordan made his money directly from advertising which means he was paid what companies thought was fair [1].  Politicians get rich from corruption and gaming the system.  The difference between them and overpaid CEO's is that what they do is obviously illegal or at least immoral.  Lots of people herald overpaid CEO's as something to aspire to.<p>[1] This is different from a typical mid to large size company CEO who's pay is decided by a board (i.e. often totally shielded from any market forces).  The board will mostly be composed of people who are themselves CEO's of companies for which this CEO is a board member...",1294739943

I think maybe it's that Photoshop's professional niche... ...use what they're used to; they're hostile to any change from the start.</i><p>I don't know about the developers and why more people aren't interested in helping out (though I suspect for a lot of people its a mixture of the difficulties of getting established in a large codebase and the beurocracy involved in a large project), but from a user point-of-view I think GIMP has a few problems.<p>I've used GIMP exclusively for many years (but I'm not a graphic designer, so my use of image editing software was never terribly heavy) and I used photoshop for the first time last summer. My transition to photoshop was a very pleasant one as, IMHO, photoshop has a much simpler and more productive interface (buttons are easy to access, convenient keyboard shortcuts, interface is not too cluttered); it has a larger range of (more advanced, generally) filters and tools; and it seems a lot faster to me too (definitely when applying filters to a large image. This can be, in my experience, quite slow in GIMP, but in photoshop most filters are almost instantaneus for me).<p>I can only assume that many other people feel the same and I imagine this may make it less desirable for people to work on GIMP, especially if there is (perceived) resistance from the GIMP developer community for GIMP to move in the direction that newcomers feel it should (eg, does GIMP still have that horrible multi-window interface? Most people dislike it (though since I started using a tiling window manager on windows it actually becomes much more usable!)).<p>Having said all that, from a user point of view, unless you make a reaosnable amount of money with your photo-editing, it is still hard to justify photoshops high price tag. GIMP being free is definitely a big plus point for it for casual use.",1294738958

And that, in the rush version, you need to use .lines on the result of .search() in order to get something you can call .size on to get the exact result you want (because it seems you can't just call .size on the result of .search(), I suspect that would just return a count of files where the string appears at least once).<p>In that vein, with a pipeline, you can look at each bit independently and reason about it.  You can't reason about what .size returns (lines or bytes or whatever) without looking at what is immediately to the left of it (and then you have to know that .lines returns an array and that .size is returning the length of that array).  And you have to know that whatever .lines returns actually has a .size method. wc -l always counts lines, no matter what its context is, because it's only ever dealing with text based input, never more complexly structured data like objects or arrays.

It's solving most of the problems of the rich people of the west but I bet the world's hungry don't find it so grand.  Especially since there is <i>plenty</i> of food to feed them.  There's just no money in doing so.",1294737069

However, it may work to mitigate the need to travel for face-to-face meetings... or to uniquely provide common-space environments for distributed offices. The second option would require large high-definition screens and high-speed internet.",1294737032

I believe he was right in stating that a text-based medium promotes reasoning to a greater degree.</i><p>I think Marshall McLuhan's views on this are worth revisiting as well, though he's currently a bit out of favor among media-studies and communications-studies folks. He's admittedly a bit extreme in parts (he seems to sometimes really believe that the ""medium <i>is</i> the message""), but there's a lot of good stuff in <i>Laws of Media</i> on how different technical choices for representing and conveying information will structure and influence the information that's conveyed, as opposed to being mere implementation details.",1294736994

What's your secret?<p>I'm sure most of the people will say: QUALITY of the blog. But what is quality without exposure. If you have exposure but no QUALITY then you're certainly doomed to fail. There are a lot of examples like this.<p>So to recap: What do you think makes a great blog, starting small and ending big?<p>Thanks,

If we ever realize a future utopia we could probably live with a small percentage of the population spending their whole life doing nothing but gaming.

Video gives out many more cues than audio only, or mere text, and if you're doing anything in a professional capacity via the internet you might not want the person you're communicating with to be able to easily obtain lots of incidental information about your life.

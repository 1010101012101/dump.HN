982412,comment,981618,981618,0,0,jsz0,,,"My theory, which is pure speculation, is that Fusion Garage misinterpreted Arrington's support. He promotes many companies on his blog, TC50 and elsewhere. It seems entirely plausible that FG thought Arrington was simply an enthusiastic supporter trying to help a small company bring a product to market. Maybe they figured he would buy a bunch of units OEM and rebrand them as CrunchPads while they were free to sell the design to other companies or market a device at retail themselves. The fact that Mr. Arrington, who is a tech savy lawyer, apparently did not enter into any formal contracts supports this theory. He should know better. It's very suspicious that he would not clearly define the terms very early in the process. This suggests to me he wanted to swoop in and take control of the product only when it was nearing its completion. FG takes most of the risk -- he jumps in at the last second if they pull off the engineering side of things. The big question is who was paying the bills?<p>Mr. Arrington originally said the CrunchPad was not about profit. So what's the problem with Fusion Garage selling their own device? Or even selling the design to other companies? Again this strikes me as being very suspicious. Wouldn't more manufactures competing against each other be true to his original vision? Was FG unwilling to sell him this hardware to be re-branded as CrunchPads or were they unwilling to give him <i>exclusive</i> access to it?",1260226088

VC's portfolio is much more diverse than ours. Therefore, after we take VC money, it is not enough that we succeed; we must succeed big enough to make up for their other losses (or losses by other partners of their firm). In general the VC's and their partners are willing to take much greater risk than entrepreneurs alone since in their eyes, succeeding small is as bad as failing big (“go big or go home”). So by taking money from VC, we will substantially increase our own risk profile and force our financial outcome to be binary, either a small piece of a big pie or nothing.

Any developer can write code, but my experience has shown that only a subset can properly diagnose issues to find their root cause. Those on the team that can do that will save you huge amounts of time and money because things will go wrong (especially in C++).<p>If you add up all the time it takes to write a particular system, I think you'll find debugging and fixing bugs to be one of the largest chunks of time, probably beating out the time it actually took you to write and possibly design the system. Obviously a design more suited to maintainability will decrease this somewhat.<p>Given this, I'd say this is an excellent question. Especially if the interviewee can tell you why it's a bad idea, or what the gotchas are with using 'delete this;'.

982394,comment,981462,982253,0,0,old-gregg,,,"It's hard to compare but Tomcat is functionally equivalent to something like Passenger, Paster or Mongrel. And last time I looked, it actually ate 80MB. It doesn't make sense to compare empty application servers: it is your running application you should be concerned with.<p>JVM is fine if you're running only a single instance of it: just use threads instead of processes. The problem with JVM is that you often can't afford to have several of them running: in Java world everything is measured in hundreds of megabytes, that's the smallest unit of measurement they use (often supplemented with references to 32GB servers, ""they're so cheap now""). Check out Batik Java library for rendering SVG. A single 45Kb SVG file, when fully parsed, eats up 150MB right here on my laptop. After serveral repeated test runs, JVM memory usage grew to a sweet 540MB, where it stopped because I capped it there via -Xmx. For comparison: Inkscape, which is an entire SVG IDE powerhouse, not just a parser, consumes only 3MB more when I open the same file in it, so that's like 50x less, plus it doesn't grow.<p>See, unlike CLR or Python/Perl/Ruby, JVM truly <i>is a virtual computer</i>, i.e. running a WAR file under Tomcat is kind of like running an Office 2008 inside of an invisible VMWare image with Windows pre-configured to occupy either 500MB or 1GB or comparable number. I just don't get why Java people are so damn proud of it. Moreover, they find nothing strange about this bizarre arrangement because they're completely absorbed by that JVM instance.<p>To demonstrate why Java doesn't belong on UNIX I invite you to implement find, grep, less and sort as Java programs, pipe them all together in a bash console and enjoy the show. :-)<p>In the end, there is nothing with Java that can't be dealt with by paying a few extra $ for hosting. The main issue is that JVM is an OS, a much more corporate, boring, uptight and over-engineered (and much less fun) than UNIX is.<p>I also want to address some of Tobias42 comments: for the most part I absolutely agree with him, except I don't follow his comparisons to Rails: we are comparing platforms here, not languages or frameworks. JVM is a memory hog compared to UNIX, and if he wants to compare Rails, I'd recommend loading his Rails app into JVM via JRuby/Tomcat and seeing what happens to his 192MB VPS box. Moreover, I wouldn't call 100ms/page (i.e. just 10 requests/second) ""lightning fast"", which makes his next comment about ""Rails taking 10x longer"" sound a bit strange: how hard does one need to try to build a web application with 1 request/second performance?",1260225771

After all, in our physical reality there's rules that ""the world"" imposes on things within it. One big one is that only one physical object (atom or what-have-you) can exist in a given location in space at a given time. Having the location of an atom in space be stored in the atom itself would seemingly make it a lot more difficult to make sure that rule goes unbroken and, arguably, can't be how the universe works as we seemingly cannot ""see"" location encoded within physical objects in our universe (that I know of).

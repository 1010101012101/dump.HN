The average jump is not to the bisection between the current node and the node you're seeking, it's to the bisection between the current node and the end of the list. As you get closer to the node you seek, the probability gets higher and higher that the skip link points past the node you seek, in which case it does nothing for you and you continue sequentially searching. I haven't done the math, but I think the expected search is O(n) - though possibly faster in practice than a simple sequential search.",1231508063

Even in a semi controlled environment, a preprogrammed biped would fall.<p>The difference is between electric motors and pneumatics: today's pneumatics are just jerkier.<p>And static balancing doesn't mean that it is preprogrammed, just that at any point (unless it is running), all movement could stop and the robot would stay standing.<p>If humans stop moving, we collapse.<p>I guess the best reason to say Asimo is not more natural is that no animal in nature is statically stable. All animals with legs have actuators with the characteristics of pneumatics and springs (in humans, tendons are springs).<p>We can also turn to efficiency. The electric motors on Asimo will _never_ be practical. It takes too much energy for the bot to ever be sold as a product. No animal in nature has a 15 minute battery life :)",1231507763

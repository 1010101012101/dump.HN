1242037,comment,1241165,1241522,0,0,arthurdent,,,"I actually think AlgoDeal sounds great, but can understand your skepticism.<p>I haven't really looked into it, but what it sounds like to me is they provide you a platform to build strategies and test them, play with fake money. They may optionally take your strategy and run it in the market. If it is successful, they split returns with you.<p>When you say they're setting themselves up to get ripped off,  I think you're suggesting that Evil Person X may come up with a strategy A that does well enough in backtests, but is paired with a strategy B designed to rip off that strategy A. Then after AlgoDeal applies strategy A, I put my secret millions to work and make better returns for myself.<p>They don't HAVE to run your strategy. I'm assuming they're smart guys and have some selection criteria other than ""performed well in backtests"", so they'd try to choose strategies that were less likely to get ripped off by the evil person's counter-strategy. Also, I think of this as being the VC who seems massive dealflow. Half of it is the fun of seeing all the good ideas and picking the top ones. Some will still fail, but choosing from a much larger base of ideas is great. Plus they utilize their own expertise to tweak strategies for themselves.<p>Its basically YC for algo strategies, except they don't have to pay you, they can steal your startup and change it a bit, and they take a much bigger percentage (i'd guess 50-80%, based on what I think are something like industry standards).<p>Its quite common place in finance to have people give you strategies and give them a cut of the profits. This takes it to the next level: crowdsources strategies and removes the barrier to entry for a lot of smart people (trading costs) in exchange for the right to tap those ideas.<p>Love it.",1270479535

It helps to recognize that it's important to her: I can see her relaxing when talking and it feels good to help her.<p>I also reserve the right to not listen to her: in that case I'll just tell her that now is not a good time — I can't handle it now but I'll listen to her later. Perhaps thanks to this, I can indeed handle her most of the time.<p>Listening is easier when I know beforehand that her train of thought just wanders around and won't probably lead to any conclusion as I would understand an ending. Thus, I've learned to not expect one. My mind does drop off the track sometimes but I know I'll soon get back to listening again. Her words are sketches so it doesn't matter if I miss <i>some</i> as long as I hear <i>most</i>. I can still keep the key things in my head and she doesn't question whether I can recite what I've heard either.<p>Sometimes I can't do better than just half-listen: in that case I can sometimes keep my cool and make her happy, sometimes she will notice and ask me to focus more on her. Sometimes I can't, sometimes I can.<p>I don't think my wife particularly enjoys when I'm explaining to her some cool technical thing or praise something I did to my car either. She's not too interested in it and she doesn't know much of what I'm talking about.

1242009,comment,1241717,1241815,0,0,jerf,,,"That's not an accurate representation of the Pythonic argument. The argument is more along the lines that having to name your blocks is not a crippling requirement, and that you can do everything you want with Python functions in 3.0 with the nonlocal keyword, and nearly as much pre-3.0 as you rarely need deeply nested scopes in Python because of the other things it supports.<p>The thing that frustrates Pythonistas is people mistaking syntax for capability. Far be it from me to claim that syntax doesn't matter, but far too many claim that things <i>aren't possible</i> in Python when in fact you're just spelling it wrong. (And there are some pros to the Python approach; naming even modestly large functions is still generally a good idea, and Python's approach to the problem is uniform vs. Ruby's ""several different type of code references"" approach, which IMHO has the Perl problem of being gloriously more complicated and tricking people into thinking these are great advantages from a local perspective when in fact if you back out to the global perspective it turns out Python still does the same things, only without the complication.)",1270478955

Ruby seemed to start off as more of a replacement for shell scripting. If anything, it was aimed at Perl, not Java. Rails was aimed at replacing PHP, not J2EE. As they matured (Ruby was 11 years old when Rails was introduced!), they spread out organically.<p>Now that I say it like that, let's put hat over heart and spend a moment reflecting on the fact that <i>Java</i> followed the same path. It was designed to replace C for embedded applications, then to embed active content in web pages, then it gradually spread and mutated into the cubicle farm fertilizer it is today.<p>With a little creativity you can take the OP and change it so that the author is ranting about the drawbacks of Java and its dynamic memory management and why neophytes luuuuuurv them some design patterns.

Apparently, this was only officially abolished as late as 1894.<p>As far as I can tell, no one really cares about it anymore.  However Korea has the advantage of more homogenous racial characteristics.  No one in my entire life has claimed to know my ancestors were low caste by looking at me.  No one has crossed the street to avoid me by looking at my face.<p>What I have experienced, is that within a second of seeing me, the occasional stranger has decided that it would be good sport to humiliate me, often with a racial joke or slur.<p>Racism is real and widespread.  Everyone should acknowledge that without getting uptight about it.  However, I don't know if current forms of social intervention by the US government are the right thing to do.  The only thing that has been shown to help historically is true economic empowerment.  Many fear that such intervention results in a false empowerment, where the ""natural"" choice of the market is inverted, which in turn results in resentment.<p>On the other hand, if racism is widespread and results from natural tendencies, the choice of the market will also reflect this.",1270476195

But when you start using a closure to e.g. represent an I/O endpoint (e.g. () => string for reading, string => () for writing to / from a console), you'll also want to do things like flush buffers.",1270476065

It's not about using your Android handset as a remote, it's about things like getting content based around what you're watching, whether that is on the screen or transfered to your phone.<p>Agree with the first part, surprised it's taken so long.

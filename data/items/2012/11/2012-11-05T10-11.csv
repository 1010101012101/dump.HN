Just that evaluating the ""matter-ness"" of something based on some objective like making a difference to humanity is baseless. If staying passive makes you happy, then take that route. If proving mathematical theorems makes you happy, then take that route.<p>You seem to be saying that the pursuit of a goal in of itself matters, something that is not really at odds with what ForrestN implies, which is that the end product (the result of accomplishing a goal) doesn't really matter, given that all paths end at the same destination.<p>I especially take issue with your last sentence, which feels like a cop-out. ""You may as well move"" is a poor reason to move. ""You may as well stay put"" has just as much validity.",1352113060

They've ended up fine but when they first raised their seed round they went out and hired a load of people. I do also know a few that are incredibly slow at hiring and it's lead to slow product development and an odd balance in the team (They have more designers than developers). I think sometimes if you hire too slowly it's hard to add more people when you start to need them. Because you have such a tight knit team that can't really change how they work to allow a few other people into the mix.<p>Somewhere in between seems best, only hire folks that really understand and fit in your vision and hire people that are going to be key for where you are slightly ahead of now over the people you needed a month ago. The team I spoke about needed designers then but now that the team has more designers than developers there's an odd balance that has lead to a beautiful but not very functional product.

That same project needed storage of files on S3, including pictures. Again, there are like a gazillion plugins for that, but none of them did what I wanted. So again, I had to implement it by myself. After trying endlessly to tweak Paperclip or others.<p>For this project I'm working on the admin interface was initially bootstrapped on top of Django's Admin. Which eventually became a liability and had to be replaced completely. The Django's ORM is also becoming a liability - because it couldn't handle queries for complex scenarios that were unrelated to ""objects"", so right now the project also makes use of SQLAlchemy - and I'll probably have to pull Django's ORM completely from the project, because the project is also doing sharding right now and I want to expand that to most tables and I can't work with a connection object that's a singleton, not to mention that the ""objects"" exposed will end up being completely different than the schema used in the DB table, so the object-mapping that Django's ORM does will stay in my way.<p>In the end, if I need to sum up the things that are still from Django in this project, there are surprisingly few things left.<p>So if you think about it, for small projects frameworks like Django/Rails are too heavy and for large projects they kind of get in the way and it's better off to start from scratch, importing components as needed, because that way you'll build abstractions that are suited for your domain and that will last longer.",1352110590

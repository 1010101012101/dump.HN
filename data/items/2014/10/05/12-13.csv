(they believe) their livelihood is at stake on the issue && b.) said statements &quot;tow the line.&quot;<p>My take on both examples:  it&#x27;s up to the rest of the electorate to raise the political stakes on said issues.  At least to the point where two presidential candidates can&#x27;t fight over who&#x27;s more pro-coal.  Or to the point where the rest of Louisiana (or even out-of-staters) can call bullshit on 11th hour text-swapping of bills immediately before they hit the floor -- that was just remarkable.  Actions such as these should provide enough ammunition for a meaningful and sustained public opposition.  Or, at the very least, actions such as these should haunt the &quot;Jindal&quot;s of our country in their pursuit for higher office (the presidency).  Certainly raising the political stakes by that measure is possible, but it is also why the &quot;Right to be Forgetten&quot; policies in Europe are so disturbing (there is bound to be more to that story).",1412513762

Health workers in the region had never experienced an Ebola outbreak and didn&#x27;t know what they were seeing in those first critical months.&quot; Yes. The ebola virus had previously appeared in other parts of Africa, and previous outbreaks have always fizzled out. There are so many urgent health problems in west Africa that at first ebola didn&#x27;t look like it needed an all-hands-on-deck response.<p>One part of that &quot;there were few doctors and nurses&quot; in west Africa has to do with the brain drain. People with medical training in west Africa are well positioned to emigrate to other countries. In the six years of my late dad&#x27;s life when he was completely paralyzed from the neck down, one of the long-term care facilities where he stayed for quite a while was staffed mostly by Liberian immigrants, with various job classifications. The Liberian immigrant community here in Minnesota (and the Tibetan immigrant community, and several other groups of immigrants) is mostly employed in hospital and nursing home work, with the more skilled immigrants of course making MUCH better incomes than they could in their home countries. Our gain is another country&#x27;s loss in the short term. (Eventually, interchange of people through immigration helps both the sending and receiving countries, because ideas and trade ties flow both ways, but those networks take time to build up, and freedom and stability in the developing country to have best effect.)<p>The stark differences between life in a barely developing country and life in a developed country are hard for people to imagine if they haven&#x27;t experienced them.

8412123,comment,8410976,8411160,1,0,oleganza,,,"Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain can&#x27;t handle micropayments, but blockchain is ideal for insurance deposits making micropayments as a separate protocol &quot;economically&quot; secure (no one wants to lose their deposit).<p>Two use cases:<p>1. Micropayment channels. When you pay to a single party in frequent small chunks, you can create a transaction that locks up certain amount upfront and than you simply re-sign that transaction moving more coins to the recipient and less back to you (&quot;change&quot;). Recipient does not publish transaction until the session is done. If you disconnect or they decide to stop providing you with a service, they simply release a transaction with the latest balance of payment and change.<p>2. Micropayment channel is not always relevant. E.g. you want to make a one-time small payment. E.g. buy a drink in a cafe for $2. We can imagine another micropayment protocol similar to Ripple where IOUs are transferred, but unlike Ripple, each IOU is ensured by at least twice the amount of real bitcoins locked up in 2-of-2 multisig transaction by each pair of nodes that exchange IOUs. In other words, it&#x27;s a Visa-like clearing house, but it&#x27;s decentralized (mesh-like) and every penny of debt is fully insured by real bitcoins being held hostage in &quot;joint escrow&quot; transaction (2-of-2 multisig).",1412512117

And spend a little bit of your time learning some IT if you expect to hire anyone decent.<p>The problem is that there are many limiting factors in questioning surveys and what you are testing them on. And determining a person&#x27;s aptitude for technology is a very subjective process. Do you test their resourcefulness by asking them what sites they visit and learn from? Do you test their actual programming ability by having them do a live coding that could be too specific case? Do you ask them about terminology which just shows they may know some buzzwords?<p>Google for a while gave up on asking algorithm questions supposedly for a certain subset of jobs they had.<p>I think as IT is getting more specialized and there is a difference between people knowing certain things it is important to have some form of domain knowledge which can be in the form of terminology quizzed, but at what level is up for debate. But maybe a more open question format would be better.<p>I think always presenting the interviewer with the code and having them look it over then provide input is maybe a better fit. It is like math, everyone wants to just use a calculator but in school you use your head at first for a while, but eventually everyone in a work environment uses a calculator anyway.<p>The computer questions should be the same, they should have access to a computer. They should then be quized on how to reason out this x code and how can I change it to be more like y. They need to be problem-solving questions, that use some critical thinking but also involves some reasonableness to them. Some may ask terminology, but it shouldn&#x27;t be the main focus.<p>It also does not help that employers don&#x27;t know what to ask for their tech jobs as well in many cases. If someone wants to hire a web developer they may just copy and paste and re-write the job requirements of a random posting they find online. This is what I imagine happens 90% of the time. The reason why job posts are such crap is because when someone posts a new requirement they probably all just update their templates that they had before-hand. It&#x27;s technological ignorance at best!<p>What is getting worse is also specialization in different sectors of computing is just confusing companies more-- Devops, machine learning, security programming, etc etc. And as computer literacy is improving in population yet code is getting automated more and more there is becoming an increasingly difficult question of what is necessary to learn for aspiring programmers who will be joining the workforce.<p>A few good devop team can easily be more productive then 3 times the size of it in developers if the developers know nothing about devops.<p>A few good machine learners can solve real problems with data mining that may save a big company millions that a group of programmer interns wouldn&#x27;t know how to do.<p>A few good pentesters can find holes you completely missed and need to patch providing your company from losing tons of credit cards through an open point of sales or losing important company data.<p>One funny way to see experience in IT security is to simply ask are we getting more safe, or less safe security wise. The answer less safe shows that they have been working in the IT security field, however if you ask researchers at universities they may not know about the level of problems in the security industry being so prevalent but they may still be good fits for specific research.<p>It is hard to manage which are necessary, and it is also hard to address skill level. There are many groups of interns now who could easily possess such skills that may be of way more use than people know as well.<p>Many companies rather hire a student out of college than a phd student because they may have some interest in some of these things and because he may have some sample projects or notice in communities even though he may not have specialized skills.<p>One of the most major faults though is that we have tons of jobs that are not using any technology at all and involve 0 programming, while others that are entirely programming. The future of programming should adapt to things where there are jobs that have people do both. Project managers and devops people should be developers as well, not just people who manage but coders. But this is only applicable to certain technology focused companies, which is becoming harder to reason not to be technology focused.<p>For the reasons above I&#x27;ve actually been learning on my own lots of diferent technologies way before trying to get a job in IT. However, IT is still too rapidly changing to learn &quot;everything&quot;, but people can benefit from learning how big companies like yahoo, reddit, facebook, netflix, linkedin etc deploy their infrastructure to handle large amounts of data. They can also learn security and machine learning as well as other more special skills which can get them a job or even better start a startup. With the ease of setting up a Software as a Service, it is becoming more approachable to start a startup then to get locked in the horrid cage of mismanaged companies as well.",1412511942

He said that while the pay is low, the lawyer who is eventually hired will gain valuable experience.<p>Obviously $10K/year for the first year is enough to make people want to sign up. The estimated eventual gains are worthwhile, so by your logic this is acceptable.<p>A negative is when volunteerism leads to stratification by economic class. If a career typically requires several years of free labor or below poverty wages, then mostly only those with access to money - through savings, charity of friends and family, or perhaps a loan - can afford that career.<p>But those who are poor, with less access to the cash needed to survive those first few years or facing higher loan rates, are much less likely to enter that career.<p>As an extreme case, if all white-collar careers required several years of free internship then mostly only the children of white-collar parents will be able to have that job. I am morally opposed to this sort of self-perpetuating class division.<p>&quot;I think that volunteering, and the volunteer-cause relationship, is radical. It might even be scary to some power brokers.&quot;<p><i>Anything</i> might be scary to &#x27;some power brokers&#x27;, so there&#x27;s no message in your statement.<p>In practice, we see that Fox Searchlight and Charlie Rose at PBS are examples of organizations which enjoyed the &#x27;volunteer-cause relationship&#x27;, and had to pay fines for it. Are they power brokers? There are similar lawsuits against ICM, NBCUniversal, Conde Nast, and the Hearst Corporation - are they power brokers?<p>If yes, then the &#x27;volunteer-cause relationship&#x27; is not scary to them. If no, then bringing up &#x27;power brokers&#x27; is tangential to the discussion.",1412511635

You get the same behaviour if you translate the example into e.g. Scheme.<p>The issue is that the name referred to in the recursive call is a global variable access, and so redefining the value of that variable produces some strange effects.  However the simple solution to this (which basically boils down to having no global variables, just lexical variables at the top level) has other problems -- it would require that every function be defined before it is used, which would enforce a bottom-up ordering to the file.  If you want to be able to place the definitions in the file in any order, and you want to have the ability to redefine functions, then this is pretty much inevitable (even if you special case simple recursion like this, you probably can&#x27;t reasonably deal with mutual recursion).<p>If you need to refer to a particular function without the risk of it being redefined, it is possible (at least in Scheme) by abusing let and set! a little...<p><pre><code>  (define countdown #f)\n\n  (letrec ((cd\n             (lambda (n)\n               (if (> n 0)\n                   (cons n (cd (- n 1)))\n                   &#x27;(liftoff)))))\n    (set! countdown cd))\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t know Clojure enough to say what the equivalent would be, but it should make sense anyway (the (define x #f0) ... (set! x y) is to produce a top-level definition of x).<p>In this case, the recursive call is to a lexically scoped variable inside the let, that is then preserved in the closure, thus the closure will always call itself regardless of what is done to the names at the top level.  You can also use the Y combinator to do it (again, the recursive call is made to a variable in lexical scope rather than global scope).",1412511173

He did it all without winning a single election: the two times he did dare run for office, he was defeated so soundly as to become a joke.<p>&quot;_The Power Broker_ is the story of how our &quot;democracy&quot; really works.

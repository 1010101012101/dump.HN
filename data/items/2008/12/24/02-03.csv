I was planning on keeping it low-key but with the ""Happy Holidays"" and ""Hacker News goes Christmas"" posts (and colors!), I thought I could balance it out a bit with some Festivus activity. I'm not particularly qualified to promote Festivus but I'm doing my best.<p>In any case, Stella is a performance testing tool, written in Ruby that also supports the Java VM (through JRuby). This is a preview release (0.5.3) but it's already useful for running and comparing Apache Bench, Siege, and Httperf tests. Here's an example from the current release:<p><pre><code>    stella -a opera-10 -w 0.5 -r 25,300 -m 'MaxClients=768' -x 5 ab -c 100 -n 10000 http://stellaaahhhh.com/search?term=trooper\n\n    -a: Use an Opera 10 User-Agent. \n    -w: Run a warm up with half the users specified for the test. \n    -r: Ramp up the number of users from 100 to 300, in intervals of 25. \n    -m: Remind yourself what this test is about.\n    -x: Repeat each test run 5 times, average the results with standard deviation. \n</code></pre>\nMore info in the release notes:\nhttps://rubyforge.org/frs/shownotes.php?release_id=29826<p>P.S. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmq-JDonTpc",1230087508

Online books are interactive with 2-way communication abilities.<p>Picture is worth of 1000 words. So paper books now add images. Now video is worth of 100,000 words. What's wrong in adding Videos in the book?<p>And most importantly, I cannot search something in paper books. That's the single most reason all paper books should be converted into online books. That advantage surpasses all these negligent disadvantages by huge margin.<p>My $0.02s of course!",1230087430

So don't be afraid to start!  If you succeed, it won't be with that idea, very likely!  And it may take years of time!  And it won't necessarily be the very next iteration of the idea that changes everything.<p>The author is not saying you will succeed for sure, or that changing one's idea is the most important factor (both are essential to your argument, but it's not what he's saying, on the other hand.)",1230087130

408415,comment,406359,407930,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Actually, the terminology is a little different for financial firms than private traders.<p>Say that you take out a mortgage on a new house. The bank lets you borrow up to a certain percentage of the house's value, say 90%. The other 10% is a down payment that you must meet with your own money.<p>Now lets say the value of your house falls from $100,000 to $90,000. The way your mortgage is written, you probably still owe the bank $90,000 (90% of the original purchase price). However, the way debt contracts are written in the financial world, you would have to PAY the bank $9,000 to reduce your total borrowing to 90% of the CURRENT value of the property, or $81,000. That $9,000 payment is a ""margin call"" in financial market terminology.<p>So, financial firms borrow up to a certain amount of the assets that they lend, say 90%. If the value of those assets drops in half, and the value of mortgages plummeted on the open market, they owe their lenders enormous sums (45% of the value of the assets, for a 50% drop in value on 90% leverage).<p>Those margin calls forced a lot of firms out of business, even though their assets were still performing and still paying enough to meet their debt payments and operating expenses. If the firms could call their mortgages, they would be fine, but they can't because the mortgage money is spent on a house which is a non-liquid asset. The financial firms likely thought that their assets were undervalued on the market because of the panic that set in, but no matter. That's not the way their contracts were written.",1230085751

Many programmers are used to reinventing the wheel poorly, either due to the ""it's fun"" factor, or the ""we can't use external code"" factor.  In that case, the CPAN isn't much of a compelling feature, since they aren't going to be using its libraries anyway.  (""I have to install a library to get a function that reads a file into a string?  Fuck it, I'll write it myself."")<p>Try doing your next project in Perl, using the CPAN where appropriate, and you'll see that the standard libraries of Python, Java, Haskell, whatever are simply inadequate.<p>(In the end, it really depends on what you are doing.

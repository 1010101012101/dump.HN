A lot of people remember that we are a search engine ""duck something"" and so naturally try duck.com. As a result, there is a lot of confusion, e.g.:<p>""I was telling someone about DuckDuckGo and they thought it was Duck.com and they went to Google.  Is Google using this to find people who make the mistake to Duck.com instead of DuckDuckGo?""<p>""Can't you do something about this?  I keep going to Duck.com when meaning to visit DuckDuckGo.com They are using the DuckDuckGo name to get people to search Google.""<p>This only started happening after I asked about the domain name. It used to point to a history page about Duck Corporation (previous name of On2 -- <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20100802014055/http://duck.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20100802014055/http://duck.com/</a>), similar to <a href=""http://www.on2.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.on2.com/</a>, which was acquired by Google in the same acquisition.<p>Google should legitimately not sell it to me, though it would have been of course nice to do so when I first asked in 2010. I think an appropriate remedy would be to either point it nowhere, point it to the original page it had been pointed to for many years, or point it to the acquisition page (as <a href=""http://on2.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://on2.com</a> still does) -- all things they do in other cases if you look at past acquisitions.<p>Just to be clear, it is only anti-competitive because it causes confusion, and relates to their core search product. The facts of the situation (that it switched shortly after I asked, and only seemingly that one domain) make it appear to be deliberate. And if it were not deliberate, I've brought this up many times and there has been ample time (including now!) to correct the situation.<p>With regards to being easy to add search engines to Chrome, see <a href=""http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2011/02/usability-issues-with-adding-search-engines-to-web-browsers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2011/02/usability-issues...</a>.

4817796,comment,4817466,4817466,22,0,neya,,,"First of all, in my opinion, executing a frighteningly ambitious idea[1] is like performing inception. You need the simplest version of the idea for it to be ""planted"" in the user's mind.<p>People aren't using DDG much not because of any difficulties in the browser, because they don't want to. This is a very lame excuse. Google never won its users because they were able to convince users to set their Search Engine as default in their browsers.<p>As for DDG, the problem starts their name - ""DuckDuckGo"". You don't need to be an analyst with years of experience to say that this won't work because even their name is not something that is a)Catchy b)Easily rememberable c)Simple. Contrast this with Google. That's just one quick, easy to remember word. Now compare, Duck+Duck+Go. That's three words and it seems <i>long</i>. It looks like they didn't put much thought into this. This is not to say that DDG didn't do their homework properly, but just that it seems a little immature, given their name and their strategy. It looks more like they just read PG's essay[1] and started something out of the quick inspiration.<p>To kill a huge competitor like Google, you need to provide more <i>value</i>. Google is very hard to kill right now because, 1)Their search is vastly superior 2)a lot of people are <i>locked</i> into their ecosystem 3)They have created a valuable <i>brand</i>. No, by locked, I don't mean it's a bad thing. For example, I use Gmail, Google Contacts, Calendar, Blogger, Google Apps for my domains and a lot of other stuff because <i>I want to</i>. A single sign-in into their Eco-system lets me use all these services. And now, the best part is there's Android which seems to integrate all these things so easily like a snap that makes my life just a breeze.<p>So, first you need to understand that Google is now more than a search engine. Because if it was, Bing would have overtook it long back. You need to analyze the reasons why people still use Google. It's not just a search engine that they're using it for. Google has taken years and years to build the trust factor into their users. It has taken them years to make all these users ""fit"" into their eco-system and create a tremendously valuable <i>brand</i> . It's not like that they did it in just one day. So, just starting a new search-engine and expecting people to join on board is not going to happen. Despite so many ""Ad"" controversies, Google is still the king here because of the trust factor that no one else in the industry is able to provide. The trust factor that they will remain here, unlike the rest is the most important value that they provide to their users.<p>If you want to kill Google at this instant, you are going to do a lot more hardwork than you thought you should do, you need a <i>brand</i> of similar magnitude and the important essence here is the time and trust factor which everyone seems to ignore.<p>[1]<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html</a>",1353566684

The article you point out hints at some of the issues:  The inter-mingling of passenger and cargo trains ends-up seriously affecting the potential performance of cargo trains.<p>With regards to it being an absurd idea.  Well, of course it is!  And so is the case for nearly every idea that sparked a revolution in technology and thinking.  The earth NOT at the center of the universe?  Absurd!  The earth not flat?  Absurd?  Everyone needs a computer on their desk?  Absurd!<p>Not that I am comparing this to any of those shifts in technology.  What I am trying to point out is that being open minded enough to even consider the seemingly absurd is an important part of discovering new ideas and developing new technologies.  I always consider the absurd.  I have hundreds of ideas catalog that are probably absurd.  The alternative is to discount everything as ridiculous without even giving it an honest look.  I just don't do that.<p>For example:  Could this high speed train take the form of an underground tunnel connecting both coasts?  This is absolutely ridiculous and probably even insane to consider.  However, I take the approach of at least doing the research to try to get a sense of proportion in terms of cost and technical feasibility.  For example, would there be an important mining element to the project that could offset the costs?  I don't know and I am not trying to argue for a 3,000 mile tunnel.

4817697,comment,4817503,4817572,2,0,cubancigar11,,,"Directly quoting from Orientalism (E. Said) since he said it best:<p>""The French philosopher Gaston Bachelard once wrote an analysis of what he called the poetics of space. The inside of a house, he said, acquires a sense of intimacy, secrecy, 
security, real or imagined, because of the experiences that come to seem appropriate for it. The objective space of a houseits corners, corridors, cellar, roomsis far less important than what poetically it is endowed with, which is usually a quality with an imaginative or figurative value we can name and feel: thus a house may be haunted, or homelike, or prisonlike, or magical. So space acquires emotional and even rational sense by a kind of poetic process, whereby the vacant  or anonymous reaches of distance are converted into meaning for us here. The same process occurs when we deal with time.<p>Much of what we associate with or even know about such periods as ""long ago"" or ""the beginning"" or ""at the end of time"" is poetic  made up. For a historian of Middle Kingdom Egypt, ""long ago"" will have a very clear sort of meaning, but even this meaning does not totally dissipate the imaginative, quasi-fictional quality one senses lurking in a time very different and distant from our own. For there is no doubt that imaginative geography and history help the mind to intensify its own sense of itself by dramatizing the distance and difference between what is close to it and what is far away.""",1353564198

Moving something through water requires over 800 times more power than in air.<p>The only thing that could make land-based transport less efficient (other than fuel and power-plant issues) is rolling and drivetrain losses.  I doubt that those make-up for the over 800-to-1 power discrepancy.<p>The greater point here isn't a pissing match between individual efficiencies but rather to look at the problem with a long (50 to 200 years) perspective in terms of pollution, fossil fuel consumption, geo-political and economic concerns and more.",1353564158

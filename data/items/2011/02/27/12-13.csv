2267750,comment,2267499,2267699,0,0,wisty,,,"There's a book currently on my wish-list called ""Why Children Hate School"", about a cognitive psychologist's take on education. He strongly stresses how important it is to drill fundamentals. The human brain is terrible at doing things it hasn't practised, and tends to avoid doing things that it doesn't know how to do. That's why people switch off when you talk about statistical significance - their brains don't remember statistics so they go to sleep instead of thinking. The path of least resistance is always ignoring things, unless you already know 80% (made up number) of what's being said.<p>DI is better than more appetising methods (i.e. ones that teachers think they would enjoy learning in), because it drills fundamentals, but I think that better methods could be built using cognitive principles.<p>Musicians stress practising scales, martial artists practice basic techniques, programmers practice Fizzbuzz every damn time someone links to that article, and everyone practices speaking in front of the mirror. But school-kids don't practice learning.",1298811269

I come from one of the riches regions in Europe (Salzburg) and I found the living standards in Japan to be at least on par. I lived in Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and Nagano so far.<p>In my opinion the Author's explanation is a little misleading. He overlooked the most important factor: ""Demographics"".\nI am referring to the article at <a href=""http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2011/january/the-japan-myth/69887.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2011/january/the-japan-...</a><p>Looking at the working age population, Japan is doing surprisingly well, better than the US, or Europe.<p>Despite the rapid decline of the working age population and the infamous long life expectancy Japan achieved economical growth.

However, I've come to realize this very much depends on the specific industry you're in.<p>Take online dating for example. Why do (most of) these guys spend insane amounts of money on marketing? I think it is because word-of-mouth for a good datingsite is held back by the social stigma that still surrounds online dating.<p>So you have a product, and people would rather not tell others they're using it.

I didn't think I would be ""smart enough"" to keep up with the courses and the competition.<p>It turns out that Stanford's CS courses aren't that <i>hard</i> -- I was able to grasp the concepts quickly, and keep up with everything discussed in lectures and in books.<p>So what makes Stanford's CS program stand out?  It's a lot of work.  A <i>lot</i> of work.  The intensity is what made the program so successful for me.  Once I finished a class, I knew the material for life, because I spent so much time studying it.  This is a huge contrast to the whole ""cram for a test and forget it the next day"" experience from my undergrad.<p>(Footnote: I was in the master's program, but I took quite a few undergrad courses to make up for my non-CS undergrad.  My undergrad was in Information Systems at George Washington University.  IS was a bad choice because the courses weren't very deep, neither in technology nor in business.  But once I figured that out, it was easier to just finish up and graduate than to switch majors.)",1298810432

Because if they spent in developing better products, you'd have to relocate your marketing resources into building some real value.<p>Also, Apple is expanding its business with its two app stores and pay for content revenue streams, so, we should expect large marketing expenditures to increase market awareness.<p>Oh. And before I forget, deciding whether you'll make a great product or a crappy-but-adequate one (or even one so crappy people are embarrassed to admit they bought it) is also part - and an important one - of your marketing strategy.",1298810385

(2) It is just crucial for us to have the money so that we can do lots of really, really important things that can't be measured.<p>So, is the article really just about (A) important issues in education or is it just (B) partisan politics fighting over money with some of the usual techniques of politics -- some truths, half-truths, deception, distortion, emotion, etc.?<p>So, to pick between (A) and (B), let's see:<p>(a) Source.  The article is in 'The Daily Kos', and I believe I've heard that this site is essentially propaganda by the more liberal wing of the Democrats and paid for at least heavily by Soros who apparently believes that US politics should be something like some of the traditions of old Central and Eastern European socialism.<p>(b) Subject.  The article is to grab people by the heart and the gut to have them open up below the belt, this time their wallet in their hip pocket.  It's a big sales pitch leading to ""Send more money"".<p>(c) Timing.  At present one of the hottest political stories in the news is the fighting in several states and especially in Wisconsin trying to reduce expenditures by state governments so that the states can have balanced budgets without raising taxes and to reduce these expenditures by fighting with unionized state employees, especially the teachers' unions.<p>(d) Unions.  Now we come full circle:  The unions are heavily in the Democrat party with propaganda site 'The Daily Kos'.<p>So, it seems to me that article really is about (B) partisan politics and not (A) education.",1298810111

2267719,comment,2267499,2267602,0,0,alextp,,,"The problem with standardized testing is not that they don't measure the progress well but that they measure all other sorts of confounding variables. Each standardized test has a small number question templates, and if the students familiarize themselves with the question templates they will do better on the tests, for example. Another important factor is timing: some standardized tests have a fixed amount of time allocated to a student, and hence there are many different ways of pacing yourself that lead to better or worse scores. Yet another important factor is the choice between open-ended and multiple-choice questions, and even the balance between these can be learned.<p>So every standardized test has some confounding variables, and effort spent teaching the students to do better on the tests by dealing well with these variables is effort that does not go towards helping the students learn the material. If the standardized tests are known and used to evaluate the teachers the incentives suddenly get really strong to teach to the test by focusing on the idiossincrasies of specific testing schemes over teaching the actual subject.<p>Standardized tests are a great way to measure performance and improvement but only if the results won't be used for decision-making, otherwise it creates an instant incentive to game the system.",1298809127

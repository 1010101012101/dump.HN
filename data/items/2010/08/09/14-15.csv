They could see what US defense contractors did, then figure out how to do it cheaper and more reliably.<p>That said, the Soviets have had an amazing record of <i>comparable, cheaper, more rugged, more reliable</i> dating from World War II.

But that's neither here nor there, at the moment.)<p>Here's a way to play with this claim. Imagine you have a person (male or female) in the right age range. Would giving the person a child to care for <i>by itself</i> remove or diminish the person's desire for sex? I'm not so sure. (Note, I'm not talking about exhaustion due to taking care of a child - a clear side-effect, nor about the biological changes that occur after childbirth.)<p>Again, I'm thinking about this issue myself, but I don't think it's cut-and-dried male/female, as you imply.",1281365760

You're secure! Hooray!<p>But of course it's not that simple. You have to consider your entire attack surface, and when dealing with a government that doesn't care if it disappears you for no good reason, there's one hell of an attack surface here. (Note: I neither know nor for the purposes of this post care if Iran is that cavalier, what matters is the existence of governments that are, somewhere, sometime, which I consider pretty likely.) They don't have to prove you've sent subversive stuff behind that encryption. They don't even have to prove you're using the subversive software. They just have to <i>suspect</i> it. Even if we assume the encrypted stuff is perfect, what other tells are there? Characteristic ports? Characteristic communication patterns? Characteristic headers? And even quick solutions to those problems, ""oh, we make it look like HTTPS"" can have problems of their own, ad infinitum. Are you doing HTTPS to sites that obviously don't serve a website? Are you trying to fake a website in a way easy to characterize? What will you do when the ISP straight-out bans websites on your home computer, making it impossible to mask your traffic that way? (And how suspicious is it for two home users to hit each other's ""websites"" every few seconds, anyhow?)<p>These are all issues that a government won't have a problem answering, and there are yet more that they won't have trouble answering. The hostiles here have it easier because their threshold for deciding they have enough information to act is very low. The only way anybody should feel even remotely confident about this is if it is reviewed.

Don't YOU hate it when you have to stop watching a movie you are interested in mid-way and do something you don't want to. Well a child has a harder time coping. Imagine your mother walks in on you fucking your girlfriend, and says in a pleasant voice (she ain't being a bitch) ""honey, please get out of her and wash the dishes"". Imagine the response you will have. Now imagine the request ""honey, I know I'm heavily intruding but you haven't done the dishes in 3 days and I am hungry, so finish up in 15 minutes and wash the damn dishes!"" I assure you the second scenario will make YOU feel responsible for the fact that this shit happened, maybe even embarrassed. But the message is VERY different. There was no painless way to get into the situation but it was as painless as possible given the circumstances and the blame now lies in the appropriate party.<p>You need to alert the child that ""homework is coming"" give em a few minutes to cope, make sure they understand they have a few minutes and let that brain work at the coping, it just takes time. Be consistent with it. Also important to let the child know why it's their fault they have to stop, if the child did the homework first the child would have the ability to watch the movie without interruption. (make sure to not go back on your word, because that will not help later on). Now if the movie is on disk, let the child know you can pause and resume later, if not, hell 5 bucks to download the movie and let your kid watch it is worth it.<p>With children every potential conflict can be turned into a learning experience one way or another. The problem is the going up to a child ""turn of the tv and do homework"". To a child that might be too sudden and too intense to immediately cope with.<p>I am 26 years old and already me and my wife noticed these little things. Most the conflicts with my 3.5year old is avoided. AND she does what we want her to do. Sometimes we turn chores into a game, sometimes we turn something she dreads into something ""fun"" because we join her. Also PICK YOUR CONFLICTS. Believe it or not, the child will want to do things differently than you do. Sometimes the way the kid wants to do it is alright, so let them have their way. The child NEEDS to feel some control over their life, give them inconsequential choices ""red or blue shirt"" fine it does not match, who cares.<p>You will have to dedicate yourself to the kids, but thats what parenting is about.",1281363258

RSA and Diffie-Hellman-Merkle-Williamson key negotiation rely on the difficulty of factoring and discrete logarithms respectively, but these are known (or believed - not sure of the current state) to be sub-NPC.<p>A clarification here is that these rely upon the existence of one way functions, of which discrete logarithms and factoring are conjectured to be in. A proof of the existence of one way functions is actually a slightly stronger result than P!=NP (as it relates to languages with only a single accepting state rather than many.

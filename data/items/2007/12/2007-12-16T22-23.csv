What option was there for Google back then, other than using ""free"" university computers and bandwidth?  No way they could've afforded it at 90s prices.  Even though prices have fallen now for <i>that</i>, there's always something too pricey for a startup.  What if your research involves a particle accelerator or something else you can't rent hourly from Amazon?  Students can get access to resources they simply couldn't otherwise, especially in the hard sciences.<p>Nobody's going to rent $100k of equipment to a student with a $500 limit Mastercard.  Not to mention, a week's rental would probably equal your tuition, so forget about having access to something for an entire semester.<p>Software startups are an anomaly.  If consumer electronics didn't conveniently happen to make inroads for you (as it did with computers and video equipment), the barrier to entry for MOST technical disciplines tends to be as high as ever.",1197844826

90171,comment,90061,90092,0,0,BrandonM,,,"This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but the photo was protected. It is not protected by fair use because the video is not a parody <i>of that photo</i>, but of something else entirely. The photographer took the picture for Wired (where the video creator apparently downloaded it after a Google search), and Wired licensed the picture for use. In the page which includes the picture, there were several links to the original photographer's page.<p>The real lesson here is to ask for simple permission when including other people's content in your own. With e-mail, this is easier than ever. Either that or make sure that it's licensed under a ""sharing"" license. Failing both of those, you'll just have to find another image.<p>This is really how it's designed to work. It's not right to be able to just take someone else's work and slap it into your own with no permission or credit.",1197842886

Thinking that it is constant, and that you can simply modify some houses and then the next day switch off a power plant is a complete daydream.  Energy demand will not fall.<p>Besides, what is missing in this calculation is the energy consumption of getting workers to those 1.6 million homes, and producing and installing the insulation materials.<p>Anyway, the question is not ""how can we switch off some power plants?"" but ""what kind of plants do we want to build to meet the growing demand?"".  The options are: coal, gas, oil, and nuclear.  Forget wind and solar---these are still toys.<p>Currently, when some country, e.g. germany, decides to ""replace nuclear with wind and solar energy"", it actually replaces it with coal and gas.

For a long time now I've observed how business majors (my roommates) go on unpunished for years of blatant cheating. It has made me completely lose faith in the system. In computer science, cheating is not such a simple proposition. Our university CS department has a no-bullshit cheating policy: first offense results in failing grade, suspension for one semester, and mark on your transcript. Second offense results in expulsion from the school of Computer Science. I've seen this punishment applied in person many times; I know the dean isn't bluffing when he says he'll do it. Also, the school CS department uses a modified version of MOSS:
<a href=""http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/</a><p>to detect the cheating. Maybe you can circumvent it if you're smart enough. Personally I have better things to do with my time.<p>Business majors, on the other hand, already have a reputation as the ""bullshit major"". You curriculum is a joke. You study for exams the day before. You party on finals week while the rest of us study. It's the major you go to when you want the easy ticket through life. And the blatant cheating they get away with just serves to rub it in the face of all the majors who actually have to <i>gasp</i> work for their degree.<p>More reading here:

I'm not disputing that. They have a degree that won't be worth the paper it's printed on, in a heavily oversubscribed major (25% of all US undergrads are business majors), with no marketable skills, and a tendency towards laziness and dishonesty.<p>Why do Business schools let this kind of stuff go on? I've talked to people in other schools, hell even business majors themselves, and they all acknowledge it. Don't people realize that they're just screwing themselves over in the long-term while accumulating the animosity and disdain of their peers?

I realized that there were thousands of great HN threads that I hadn't seen because I hadn't been paying attention to the site when they were ranking.
So I pulled together a little db of the top 10,000 HN threads (loosely defined; a thread with >1 points, 1> comments, and some web link rank).
I put these into a random shuffle so that reload would give me 30 fresh threads that I (probably) hadn't seen before.
I'm pretty happy with this. Lets me scratch my HN itch when I've exhausted the main page, and it's often interesting to see the old material again.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2226914"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2226914</a>",1310973558

Speaking as if there's nobody consuming marijuana and legalizing it is going to suddenly cause a huge burst in consumption is simply factually incorrect. It may cause an increase, but it can't cause a huge increase.<p>It is a dishonest tactic that is almost always used by proponents of a law, to slip in the hidden assumption that the law already works, or will simply work if added, even when flatly contradicted by the truth. Personally, I can't hardly conceive of how marijuana prohibition could be any more of a failure than it actually is.<p>None of the rest of what you talk about is relevant, as you simply read into my post. I'm not even claiming ""it's there already so let's legalize it"". I'm just saying, ""it's there already and arguing implicitly as if it's not is dishonest"". Arguments shouldn't be based on dishonesty.<p>I will, however, point out that the badness that could be added is fairly sharply bounded by the ready availability of the product today. Prostitution and human trafficking have been at least reasonably well suppressed, and re-legalizing them would have an effect. I'm not convinced there's a large number of people for whom the sole reason they are not smoking is that it is illegal. So your metaphor, as is so often the case with terrible metaphors brought out to make a dubious point in an argument, is not applicable.<p>(Note I didn't add mention ""arms dealing"". I don't think that has been ""reasonably well suppressed"" at all.)<p>You probably think you're arguing with a pothead. Actually, I pretty much agree with everything about the nature of marijuana you said. I do not smoke it myself and have every intention of telling the truth about it to my children (which is that it isn't going to kill you but it is certainly dangerous with little compensating gain). But I don't mistake my morality for good government policy. The effects of prohibition have been a net negative, and no amount of moralizing on my part (or anybody else's) about how it just <i>shouldn't</i> be that way can change that.",1237067672

A related issue is that processed foods are essentially a combination of corn, soybeans & sugar. Bottom line: people are eating worse food, but they are choosing to do so, not being forced.<p>Growing your own vegetables is labor intensive. Although it can be emotionally rewarding, specialization is more rational economically.

Scottish politics. The best two sources of information on political life in Scotland are the country's two quality newspapers - The Scotsman and the Herald. (This isn't saying much: appropriately, they're both very, very poor shadows of their former selves). They are far and away better than the Scottish TV news, which mostly reports on their reporting or on events which are a matter of public record. Online coverage that isn't merely opinion or repurposing from the print stuff is incredibly scarce.<p>Without those papers -- and both are in fairly unhappy financial situations -- I'm not sure who is going to cover this stuff at all, in fact. The country already suffers from a deep deficit of investigative reporting: many of the local councils are virtual fiefdoms. And don't think it doesn't matter on a wider scale: The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and former Bank of Scotland (HBOS) both played key roles in bringing disaster down on the UK and global economies.<p><i>Since we never had a good mass media, and never will, it is more realistic to discuss how to alter the structure of government, to make it less dependent on the whims of the masses</i><p>I don't grant the premise: we may not have ever had a mass media that lived up to our ideals, but I'd say we certainly have one that attempted to: Watergate (the entrance of which is rapidly becoming the Godwining of dying-newspaper threads) is proof enough of that.<p>Ultimately, the role that journalism provides is accountability. It holds power to account. If you can come up with a structure of government that takes into account human nature and is one where the rulers don't need to be held to account by the governed <i>and</i> has a realistic implementation plan, I'll be amazed.<p>But I think it might be a whole lot easier to sort out how we do the accountability thing without print media. Even though I think that's going to be hard :)",1237066990

Act as if you don't understand something and be a bit rude.  If the programmer does anything except listen to you and patiently try to help you then he/she is no-hire.<p>Explanations:<p>If the programmer doesn't complete interesting projects in their spare time they don't have enough passion for programming.<p>If he/she can't explain something clearly it's highly likely they can't communicate with business folks effectively in general hence they're not going to be effective at the job.<p>There's a lot of angry programmers.

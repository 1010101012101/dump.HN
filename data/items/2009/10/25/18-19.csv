But don't expect to get a tour of the offices (cube farms) - most companies are highly secretive of their workplaces and employees are not allowed to give grand tours.<p>Googleplex is more interesting when they have events but they tend to do that less now.<p>For startups, for me more interesting things are happening in The City (San Francisco). Take a trip up here and hang out in SoMa - many startup people hang out in cafes like Centro, Epicenter, Ritual Roasters, Maxfields, etc.<p>Check upcoming and facebook for events that might be going on, but Monday is a quiet day usually.",1256497183

The classic Mac OS existed until 2001 and still lacked memory protection -- You had to remember to save your work before opening Netscape!  Then they didn't even develop their own OS, but instead purchased NextSTEP which was already 12 years old at the time and circling the drain.  Then, instead of throwing out the old stuff, they bolted the Carbon API onto it to allow classic Mac applications to be ported easily.  So you really couldn't be more wrong about Apple.<p>On the other hand, the number of applications that Mac OS X must run to be accepted can be counted on the collective hands of the OS X engineers.  They can almost afford to break whatever they want as long Photoshop runs.  Microsoft does not have that luxury.<p>The command line vs. GUI argument doesn't hold water either.  Instead we're comparing the desktop metaphor with some concept that doesn't exist yet.  Operating system research is always on going and the really good ideas percolate up into all the current operating systems.  You can't just radically change direction -- even Apple knows that.  In fact, they've been removing features (like creator codes) that distinguished them from Windows and Linux basically because being compatible with the universe is more important than being innovative.",1256496920

901956,comment,901770,901853,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"You will spend much more than 10 hours per year unless things go spectacularly well.<p>I was a landlord for a few years: I rented out a single family house in a nice suburb and I had great tenants and positive cashflow from day one! Even so, you still want to go by the place periodically to make sure it's still standing (you can write off the gas/expenses for this since it's business-related travel!). You have to collect rent and make sure the checks don't bounce. I like money in hand, so I don't want checks mailed to me. You need to file paperwork in some cities for annual rental property registration, need to keep records for taxes, there may be some repairs needed. At the very least you'll need to make sure the repairs are done right.<p>Easily way more than 10 hours/year. I had a friend who both worked for a property management co and who rented out houses for years. His feeling was that unless you had multiple properties, paying the company wasn't worth the lost revenue.<p>The biggest risk is having a renter who not only doesn't pay, but trashes the place on his way out and has no assets you can get in a lawsuit. It happens, but you can minimize your exposure. In any event, renting property is not something to be entered in to lightly. Don't do it if you heart isn't in it.",1256496651

If the problem is <i>big</i> enough that it's unwieldy enough (ie. take too long to develop and TEST internally), then it definitely makes sense to investigate 3rd party options.<p>That said, developing internally is sometimes the only answer: when you don't get a good feeling from the 3rd party options (based on research), when the 3rd party cost is too high, etc.<p>Of course... it's usually more fun to develop internally.  :)",1256496641

For instance they barely mentioned that excess CO2 results in ocean acidification.  How important is that?  Well for a start we're threatening the survival of every animal that depends on calcium carbonate shells (think corals and shellfish), and then threatening the rest of the ecosystem within which they live.<p>Injecting sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere to cool us down (and create more acid rain) helps our temperature, but doesn't help with the next pollution disaster.

There's no such thing as a cash machine that requires no maintenance.<p>I'd look at high <i>dividend yield</i> stock that pays out monthly (6% yield or more).

Investing in oil is an ethical dilemma but there are domestic oil companies that are better. PIF.UN is an example of a domestic Canadian one that pays about 10% monthly dividends with no hassles, but if in the US you must never trade in other currencies. Preferred stock also provides a stable price and in this economy you can easily get 10% or more monthly div's. Investigate DDR.PR.G or other Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) if you like the real estate angel. Be careful if the yield is above 12% because it could be that the stock's price is falling, which inflates the yield %. I AM NOT A CERTIFIED INVESTOR.

There is full time work involved for many months in terms of at least ensuring the acquisition is worthwhile, and often without dedicating workers full time to deal with it, things go south.

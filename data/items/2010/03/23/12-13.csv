The C coding standard documents of various projects and organizations are also useful to give you an idea of what peoples' notions of sensible C look like - they can be  surprisingly varied.<p>Lastly, review known good code in the field you're interested in - in your case, this might be Python extensions. There aren't a lot of terribly good reasons to use C to 'hack on small Unix tools'. Your best path to learning the language is writing things that you actually need and where C is a good (or only) choice.",1269349010

I'm sure some would argue that I don't love engineering enough to do it anyway, and the field is better off without me. Maybe they're right, but I figure there are other areas that can be interesting and suffer from less of the wage and job pressures engineering is facing. You can imagine my surprise when I started to get excited about engineering and then I did my research and found the 'shortage' is really not so dire or real as public pronouncements had me believe.<p>I think it's a complex problem and would agree that dismissing any doubts against it as being largely xenophobic is a little unfair.

That said, I'm a HUGE proponent of calisthenic-type workouts, and I think that something like this is definitely more good than bad.<p>If you wanted to supplement this, without significantly increasing the difficulty, do something similar with situps on the off-days.  If you're doing M-W-F for pushups, then do the same incremental workout with situps on T-Th-S.<p>Better still would be to add some walking to the mix.  Walk a mile on Sunday, perhaps.<p>One other thing that I do to round out cardio (as I am also in horrible shape at the moment) is to start off each 'workout' session with jumping jacks.  They're simple, easy, hard to screw up more than a little bit, and do a great job at getting you warmed up.  Start with 10 or 20, and again, just keep incrementing upwards as they get easier.  I personally would do jumping jacks (or jumping rope as they get easier) before every workout.<p>Regardless, good luck on your goal.

1212726,comment,1212568,1212703,0,0,dbrown26,,,"Most people have very different ideas and goals for fitness than a physical trainer. They come from the perspective of already having a minimum level of fitness, so a more rounded regime is necessary.  For a bare beginner, the 100 pushup and 200 situp programs are great.  They are compound movements, meaning they use lots of different muscles, rather than the typical machine workout you get with most trainers.  I would only add a similar program to get you to 300 squats so that you get some lower body workout in as well, especially as your goal is a triathlon, requiring both running and cycling.  The buildup should be about the same as the other exercises, so it should be as easy as multiplying the 100 pushup workout by 3.  Good job for getting started and if you get really serious, I highly recommend looking up your local Crossfit affiliate (<a href=""http://www.crossfit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crossfit.com</a>).

Most of the language is covered in about 250 pages followed by standard library function, algorthims and data structures and ends in a good project ""The Little C Interpreter"". Its about 800 pages but then its a reference so you don't need to read it in one go :-)",1269346389

I like it because it is SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time framed. That said, I have spoken to a qualified physical trainer, and they weren't to impressed by it. She said a workout program should be more varied. \nBut it works for me because I am extremely out of shape, so I have been using the program to develop the habit of exercising 3 times a week. Once the 6 weeks are up I hope to move to a more balanced and realistic fitness program.<p>The outcome of all this is that I have set a goal to complete a triathlon within a year (just the sprint TA: half km swim, 16km bike and 5.1 km run) Its a tough goal for me because I smoke heavily, drink a lot and I love to cook heavy gourmet meals.<p>All the same, this program (100pushups) is starting to instill the discipline I need to reach my one year goal.",1269346199

I'd also venture to say that public school systems are <i>not</i> the ideal institutions for such a play.<p>Consider private institutions of primary, secondary, and higher education, as well as public colleges and universities: In these venues, the student, or his/her family, is responsible for the cost of textbooks. That amount can be huge. The high cost is the result of a lack of competition. The lack of competition is due to the barriers to entry that are bolstered by the textbook publishers.<p>Given a student body already well-armed with iBook-compatible devices (likely today), it seems to me the overall cost for educational materials (textbooks) will decrease significantly.<p>If a given author is unhappy with the iBook Author EULA, then I suggest that he or she publish their content as a PDF document.

This is far beyond what a consumer should expect from such software. If Apple wants exclusive distribution deals, it should make people sign for it so that both parties are completely aware of what they're getting into.<p>And the iTunes business model was never about exclusivity. You can buy most of the music on iTunes elsewhere. (There is some exclusive content, obviously, but it is the exception, not the rule.)

3
50 million daily visits, and to account for approximately four percent of the total traffic on

collected during the existence of the Mega Conspiracy from premium users are estimated to be

I've never written code to work around a problem (as the article suggests), and typically on the few occasions I've had problems I've remedied them by using Mercurial commands I already knew without even needing to look up documentation.<p>Opinions are clearly divided between two tools that perform the same task in very different ways.

Services and virtual goods are as baked into their service as physical ones -- anywhere you describe a payment, in sending, accepting or disputing one, 'service' is an option in the dropdown. Their buyer protection policies and seller protection policies explicitly call out what portions apply and don't apply to virtual goods. Not shipping a tangible item does not automatically put you in a bad position with disputes or chargebacks -- I win virtually all of them.<p>I consume a lot of other SaaS products, and the majority of them accept PayPal alongside credit cards. I run several ""recurring virtual services"", and have done so for many many years, and have hundreds of subscribers paying with PayPal. My PayPal account is 11 years old now and some of my PayPal subscribers have been around more than half that long.<p>When PayPal's customer service fails it tends to fail spectacularly, but all evidence points to these failures being exceptionally rare given the size of their user base.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/z1fTG.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/z1fTG.png</a>",1327032254

Suffice to say the area has grown significantly in that time.<p>Medallions are largely a red herring. Municipalities vary, and I can&#x27;t speak to Seattle, but for example, New York also is in a similar situation (the number of medallions has not increased commensurately with the increase in population since 1970).<p>However, you do not need to own a medallion in order to drive a car, just as you do not need to own storefront real estate in order to operate a retail business. You can rent medallions, and many (most?) drivers do this[1].<p>In addition, you don&#x27;t need to either rent or own a medallion in order to drive a cab - you just can&#x27;t take street hails. (These cabs are regulated as well, but differently from yellow[0] medallion cabs)<p>The medallions are a very common talking point, and it always irritates me because it&#x27;s such a misleading statement. Medallions are not the barrier to entry for individuals who want to start driving professionally.<p>[0] Or green medallion cabs, which were introduced last year.<p>[1] They also often aren&#x27;t driving their own cars, which is something that Uber/Lyft/etc. ignore - if you don&#x27;t already have a car to drive (or in Uber&#x27;s case, the <i>right</i> kind of car), you&#x27;re out of luck.",1414367909

8513063,comment,8509213,8510250,0,0,smsm42,,,">> how do you solve it without know the quadratic formula or some such?<p>This is actually possible, if you&#x27;ve been taught to solve problems instead of being taught to apply magic formulas. Of course, one is rarely taught math this way now.<p>Let me try. Suppose you have 3x^2+5+2x=7. Now, you have no idea how to solve for x. But what you could solve? If you had something like (ax+b)^2 = c, then probably this would be easy for you to solve, right (of course, provided c is not negative, won&#x27;t get into that now)? We just take square root of both parts, and then it&#x27;s a simple linear equation. Now, we can notice we can also get rid of a, for simplicity, by dividing both parts by a and get something like (x+b)^2 = c. Which in our example should represent 3x^2+5+2x=7 or alternatively x^2 + 2/3x - 2/3 = 0. But how we find proper b and c?<p>So, is there a way to make that equation look like that with suitable values? Let&#x27;s look at (x+b)^2 = x^2 + 2bx + b^2. We have 2bx = 2/3x which means b = 1/3. So we have (x+1/3)^2 on one side, and on the other side we have to get 2/3 and also additional 1/9 which is the b^2, meaning c would be 7/9. So, x + 1/3 is sqrt(7/9) with + or - sign (since square on non-zero root always has 2 options), and x would be that minus 1/3.<p>As you can see, we used no special magic formula - only thing we needed is how to write (x+b)^2, which is easy to see just by multiplying (x+b)*(x+b) by hand.<p>You can do cubic equations this way too, but it is considerably more laborious. Look up Cardano and Vieta methods. Doable but I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy doing it by hand too much.",1414367866

I&#x27;m trying to simulate industrial ascenscion on there right now, moving from nothing to self-sustainability to post-scarcity. And whilst resource aquisition goes up exponentially, the machinery I build becomes more and more complex, and the time I spend engineering things goes up dramatically. I moved from half an hour of thinking on each project to spending an average of a week on  most of my current projects. The next one down the line I&#x27;m projecting at about a month, gathering data, designing and testing.<p>Now I understand that directly applying that to a larger system isn&#x27;t prudent, but I notice distinct similarities in other projects I take on, with the only difference being time scales and project complexity. Which makes sense, since civilisation as a whole, or even a career take a lot longer than the two months I&#x27;ve been playing around with the idea in a simplified system.<p>So I personally believe that once we hit that point, we&#x27;ll be at a state of peak engineering, where our progress and the size of the projects we can take on is limited by the amount of brainpower we can spend on them. What I&#x27;m saying is that there won&#x27;t be geniuses everywhere. We&#x27;ll be more productive as a whole, but there&#x27;s a ceiling on how much can be done by one person in a given timeframe.",1414367833

The meat eater in my house loved it.<p>When made well (and fresh), it has the texture of the tenderest chicken or pork you&#x27;ve ever eaten. And, it should not taste like flour, at all. It&#x27;s mostly the protein from wheat (I use Bob&#x27;s Red Mill vital wheat gluten, which is 80% protein), and none of the other components that taste starchy or bread-like.<p>I&#x27;ve been using a variation of this recipe as the basis of my seitan experiments: <a href=""http://www.theppk.com/2009/11/homemade-seitan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theppk.com/2009/11/homemade-seitan/</a><p>I make a double batch and still use less broth and water (I use six cups total simmering liquid for a double batch), as the recipe calls for way too much.<p>For sausage, I add rubbed sage, thyme, cayenne pepper, fresh minced ginger, and white pepper. A touch of brown sugar is also a reasonable addition. Once boiled, I slice it into 1/4&quot; patties and put it into the toaster oven, on a pan oiled with a bit of peanut oil, to broil for 5-10 minutes to make it sizzly and a little crispy. It really is pretty awesome; I serve it with vegan biscuits and gravy (I make the gravy from the remaining broth from the seitan cook).<p>In short, seitan is one of my absolute favorite foods. I was ambivalent about it, until I had really good fresh seitan at a vegetarian Chinese restaurant. I tried for years to find some at the store that was as good, and was always disappointed. The key seems to be to make it fresh.",1414367601

After taking a formalistic approach they decided to veer away from rigid analytical inquiry and embrace empathy. Einstein famously had this to say, which can can be applied with somewhat reduced accuracy to Jainism:<p><i>Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in the cosmic religion for the future: It trancends a personal God, avoids dogma and theology; it covers both the natural and the spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity.</i> - Albert Einstein<p>You should not be so quick to dismiss other traditions.",1414367139

I was exercising but there was a pain in the buttocks and it was getting worse and I finally had to stop. Sitting at work caused pain after 1 hr, then 30 minutes, then 15. Driving to work caused pain. Stopping the bike did not help alleviate the problem. Went to the Dr who referred me to a physio. None of the exercises given to me helped. It took me a while to diagnose what I was experiencing - googling symptoms finally led me to a set of exercises that has helped incredibly. I am not fixed yet; I have to do the exercises ideally twice a day or at a minimum once every two days. It is much much better but it was torture when undiagnosed.<p>So if you have pain in the &quot;middle of each or both buttocks&quot; when sitting for a small amount of time, consider piriformis syndrome. If you feel you are constantly clenching your buttocks read up on it as well. The exercises to get relief are very simple, can be done lying down, and start showing promise after about 2 days. The exercises I do are on Youtube.<p>Which reminds me... I need to call my physio and let her know... hopefully this information helps someone else.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piriformis_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piriformis_syndrome</a>",1414366981

Since there weren&#x27;t any standing desks, I would either stand myself near a wall or an unused desk I could lean on and carry a clipboard, or I would occasionally grab a music stand or an unused lectern. I had never felt particularly uncomfortable in a normal desk before, but for the first time I really felt unconstrained by my environment. I&#x27;m naturally somewhat fidgety, and gaining the ability to readjust my body comfortably without bothering anyone and to pace around the classroom (even in a very small area) really allowed me to get my blood flowing more easily and prevented me from being distracted from any discomfort I had in a desk built for people who were both smaller than I was at the time and who were not left-handed. Talking to the teacher (or even to other students) feels much more intimate, as your vision isn&#x27;t obstructed by the back of someone&#x27;s head. Something I didn&#x27;t expect was that when participating in class discussions, I felt more expressive, as I tend to move my hands and arms when I speak, something I couldn&#x27;t do easily in a sitting desk.<p>I wonder, though, whether or not some of both the student&#x27;s and my improvements were caused by being on a different plane from the rest of the class. I also wonder what effect having some standing students in a classroom would have on the seated children. I was once told that I was somewhat intimidating when I was the only one standing in the classroom.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether standing desks are the best option for everyone, but they&#x27;re certainly a better option for some, and I&#x27;m glad to see standing desks being given greater consideration nowadays.",1414365875

It&#x27;s at the very core of my ambivalent feelings about companies like Uber and AirBNB.<p>There aren&#x27;t great social injustices at work here, overheated rhetoric aside.<p>At worst there&#x27;s run of the mill corruption. The concepts of what these kinds of regulation do are well-founded and something society has clearly wanted. The exact implementations may well have been corrupted, but the stated intent of the laws and regulations are in the public interest, and the public has been happy-ish with them.<p>Does that then mean the fix is to throw out the whole regimen of rules? For example, someone mentioned Seattle hasn&#x27;t issued new medallions in decades.  So the solution is to do away with medallions?  Why not just issue more?<p>What about county level food safety inspectors?  Many of those regulatory agencies are also corrupt. And don&#x27;t even start with alcohol licensing. But should we &quot;disrupt&quot; those too?  Just ignore them because there&#x27;s some corruption in the system?<p>When you get down to it, none of these companies want to increase consumer choice. In their perfect world, they&#x27;d be the only choice. So it&#x27;s hard to accept they&#x27;re really out for the public good.<p>And that makes it really difficult for me to cheer them on as they pick and choose which laws they accept as valid expressions of the people&#x27;s will.<p>The people aren&#x27;t really being given a vote here. Well, actually, they have been given a vote, and these companies are choosing to ignore it for their own benefit.<p>As I said, it&#x27;s not some great social injustice at stake.

Otherwise it looks like programs are limited to the most basic level everywhere. I do remember the MS JVM was significantly faster than Sun&#x27;s. So the solution was to slow it down or for Sun to make it&#x27;s own faster?<p>It&#x27;s in Microsoft&#x27;s interest to make things run faster on it&#x27;s own OS.

Just because people are behaving in a certain way doesn&#x27;t mean that they are fully aware of the consequences of those actions. When it&#x27;s only a small part of your life, it has little impact but when you suddenly realise a large chunk of your life depends on those choices it can be a bit of a shock (consider all the celebrities who had private images leaked recently).",1414365264

In using sums like &quot;million dollar&quot;, &quot;10 million dollar&quot; and then terms like &quot;home run&quot;, &quot;swing&quot; etc. you&#x27;re actually trying to define different scales of startup ideas that don&#x27;t have a better terminology - but probably should.<p>There is a completely different risk profile in small businesses, then paid apps, then freemium products, then ad supported products. They are distinct, we just don&#x27;t have a good way of communicating the differences.<p>One school of startup advice advises against raising money while another says to raise as much as you can. Rather than being in conflict, it is clear that they don&#x27;t actually contradict each other but rather apply in different situations.<p>The don&#x27;t-raise-money school that DHH et al preach is suitable for paid products and services, while an ad supported idea like a search engine or social network, or an idea with heavy R&D requirement requires that money is raised.<p>One million / 10 million / home run is a very imperfect way of classifying this distinction. The differences are all in the cashflow model - atm we refer to a flat cashflow model, a linearly increasing cashflow model, an exponentially increasing cashflow model and cashflow models that go negative for 2-3 years and then go either linear or exponential all as &#x27;startups&#x27;.",1414365209

I guess what I had in mind was an agency that constantly re-evaluates other agencies and writes the legislation to wind down and then shut down needlessly bureaucratic agencies that preserve the problems to which they are the solution. At the end of the day, an act of law needs to be passed to shut down agencies which came into existence via acts of law.<p>The more I see how government is run, the more I see that lawmakers are commit generators that never take the time to re-factor all the code they&#x27;ve committed to production.

I checked and he was wrong so I told him so but he refused to acknowledge this and suddenly I was faced with a bunch of people picking on me. I was followed everywhere i contributed and all my edits were reverted by seemingly fans of said admin who also showed up to gang vote against me in all attempt at resolving conflict.<p>So I went to the public wikipedia space to ask for help and discovered said admin had silently modified the internal global wikipedia policy to reflect his view and it&#x27;s all downhill from there. I started receiving threats and at this point I was spending 4 hours daily on wikipedia but barely contributed a thing to the content anymore. After a bunch of ineffective bans I worked around, all my contribution were deleted on ground that I had no right to add content while banned.<p>Then came the messages from people experiencing the same situation who supported me because I stood up, I got tipped that a bunch of admins were discussing me on a secret page and escalated the issue until it reached jimbo wales himself who dismissed the whole thing as he said he fully trusted his admins. 
Then I discovered that other people went through the same process before me, I wrote an article on the importance of newcomers for a healthy wikipedia long term and the bias of the power structure and a weakness of wikipedia that would allow a few individuals to ruin the whole project. For this I received a permanent ban from all wikimedia project and a request from the top of the power structure to delete all my contribution to wikipedia side projects, wikitravel just deleted everything no question asked.<p>So i did the same thing others did before me I replaced a key article of wikipedia with this very story that happened to and reverted my change so now this story would live hidden in a page history inside wikipedia and stopped contributing to wikipedia to do something worthy of my time instead.<p>back then wikipedia was already a totally different thing that what it pretended to be and imho the problem wikipedia has cannot be solved with a better editor.",1414364582

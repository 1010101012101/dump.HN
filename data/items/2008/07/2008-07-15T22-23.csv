Both my day job and my start-up were very challenging (I worked in a large consulting company, at an investment banking client... not the place to fall asleep on the job). The modafinil meant that each and everyone of those hours was highly productive, instead of spending most of that time in a zombie-like state.<p>Of course I tried coffee. It really doesn't help me that much, though. I end up feeling very awake, sure, but very jittery (not good when projecting an air of confidence to your clients at the bank) and even more distractable (considering how distractable I am to begin with, that's something!). Modafinil, on the other hand, focuses me like a laser.",1216160003

""How much time you <i>didn't</i> spend writing that open-source code from scratch in the first place"" is the metric.

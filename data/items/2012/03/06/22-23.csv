3673290,comment,3672815,3672815,2,0,larrys,,,"The article doesn't address what could be the most important factors.<p>First, your relationship with a lawyer is a personal relationship. And it's hard to break a personal relationship over a yearly price increase of single digit %.<p>And lawyers regularly wine and dine and become ""friends"" with their clients. The client really thinks that the lawyer likes them. If you've ever worked in sales you know what I mean by this. Lawyers are nice and friendly and that insures the loyalty of the client. When I was in high school I delivered gifts to the clients of a small law firm. I remember the partner deciding who got what gift (based on amount of work). This wasn't a bribe. Just a thank you to insure ongoing loyalty. (Maybe some were bribes of course).<p>Remember rates aren't doubled they go up a little each time they are raised. If you are already paying $400 per hour you aren't bolting for $425/hr. It's not like rates are doubling in a year.<p>The other reason is FUD. People convince themselves and rationalize that a certain lawyer at a certain rate will get the job done. They are afraid of switching lawyers and having a bad outcome.<p>So the above is certainly one of the things that keeps legal rates high.<p>What about new startup lawyers? Well the way any professional service works you start out with whatever work you can get at whatever price you can get (let's say). Then as you gain clients you slowly wean yourself from the low priced clients (by taking longer, not returning calls etc.) and they get the message. This leaves you with the best clients who you can raise rates on (because they like you and are fearful of changing).<p>So even if there was a group that charged low rates (to corporate buyers) over time their rates would rise as well. Because of the person factor I mentioned in the first paragraph.<p>Finally, even though lawyers can now market (I remember when they couldn't) they won't ""sell"" in the traditional sense. If I sell a service (like web hosting web design or unix sysadmin) I can pickup the phone and call people. I can go door to door. I can place ads. Lawyers can place ads of course but that's not the most effective way to sell personal services. Then you are waiting for someone to contact you. Selling is selling. If lawyers were ethically allowed and it was acceptable practice to ""cold call"" I believe you would see rates dropping in certain types of work.",1331073839

That doesn't mean it's devoid of unintended consequences, inefficiencies, and issues, though. Immigration is a very hard problem to solve for, especially given the heated emotional discourse about it on a political stage.<p>The process up until the 1930s didn't do all right--you're being naive in your nostalgia. It created an entire underclass, gave rise to ghettos, and forced people to give up their names in order to take more anglicized names. Moreover, there was a huge strain on infrastructure with the influx of poor Southeastern Europeans immigrating (mixed in with an incredible dose of racism and xenophobia). Wikipedia has a good summary of the laws and why they were passed [1].<p>There are a lot of problems with the immigration policy, and there are a lot of reasons that it's the way it is. My point is that this particular case of a guy being denied a visa could hardly be thought of as insane. Unfortunate for him, yes. Insane, no.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_laws_concerning_immigration_and_naturalization_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_laws_concerning_immi...</a>",1331073364

It's called permits and paid on completion. If the electrician doesn't pass on his permit, it doesn't reach completion and you don't pay. Why does this system work for framers, brick layers and every other trade, but it doesn't work for an electrician. Sorry that's fishy.<p>I legally can do my own wiring on my own house here in Canada and get it inspected by the ESA and then the building inspector to pass permit. An electrician has to pass the permit anyway. Why can I not work on someone elses house and get the ESA to pass my work? Why can I not apply for the ESA to inspect my work and verify that I'm a competent electrician.

None of the factors pointed to here would actually limit choice or restrain price movement.  It is a free market, but that does not mean that the market lacks information asymmetries that would artificially morph prices.<p>As Antone points out, there is a strong quality perception issue. Ironically, it is the Bottom Line Law Group that is fighting this perception of quality on a daily basis (vs a Wilson or Fenwick). Thus it does not matter if the supply increases if the consumer perceives the bottom-end as an inferior good.<p>This skewed perception is rooted in a total lack of transparency in the legal industry. This lack of transparency limits the consumers ability to find lawyers like Antone, and keeps the cost of standard information and a simple opinion high.<p>I agree with Antone that the industry is on the brink of change, but it is a BIG messed up industry.  Change will come in many forms within the industry's mirco verticals. It will come from networks of smaller more specialized law firms such as the Bottom Line Law Group, and from innovations which create more transparency in the industry to find qualified attorneys and access quality information.",1331072949

They've been there since pre-backbone era.<p>Now they've got scaffolding tools to produce skeletons too, in case you were confused about the MVC approach which was unclear for quite some time. Studying examples helps a lot. My app has become too heavy - 20+ views, 15+ custom UI components, 8+ stores, 20+ controllers. Their MVC & the new class system results in a very maintainable code. Though I'm in the phase of re-architecturing my app and implement a view cache as seen in kitchen sink. I also feel putting in many sencha classes is heavy, I plan to reduce the views and controllers as much as possible. Our initial UI was done by a graphic designer in photoshop, it didn't care much about sencha touch's existing components.

If a commodity is in short supply relative to the number of people who want to buy it, its price will rise, producers and sellers will make higher profits and production will tend to rise to meet the excess demand. If the available supply of a commodity is in a glut situation, the price will tend to fall, thereby attracting additional buyers and discouraging producers and sellers from entering the market. In a free market, buyers and sellers come together voluntarily to decide on what products to produce and sell and buy, and how resources such as labour and capital should be used.""<p>Given this definition, it is hard to see how there could ever exist a free market in professional legal services and surely only a fool (or possibly a lawyer), would seek to argue that there is one in existence already given the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.",1331071630

To use your corporate analogy, it's as if the hiring committee of a major corporation decided that there were so many applicants for jobs that everyone the company would hire should have the same skills and credentials that the people on the hiring committee have -- master's degrees and continuing education credits -- even though what the company needs to hire is janitors and security guards.<p>You don't think that people who come here illegally (or, best case scenario, who come here under agricultural visas that give them temporary residence and no stake in the country) to work in the fields or construction are contributing anything?  Well, enjoy it when your food doubles in price, then.  Or, more likely, enjoy your food staying the same price but the people who grew it don't have any labor protection laws or real roots in this country.<p>My point is not that we should just open the borders willy-nilly.  But we need to have some kind of process for people who want to live here that doesn't result in decades of limbo, and doesn't cost tens of thousands of dollars to someone who's going to take up a minimum-wage agricultural job.  And the process should help them become Americans.  You know, like the process did for most of this country's history up until the 1930s or.  That process did all right, as near as I can tell.",1331071430

3673136,comment,3672706,3672706,2,0,bencpeters,,,"I think car-sharing is a hard sell and is going to remain that way for a long time in the majority of this country. With the exception of a few areas (Manhattan, and maybe a few other urban centers on the east and west coasts), most US cities are way too dispersed to entice most people into giving up a car, to say nothing of suburban and rural areas. Additionally, there are a lot of people for whom the ability to make a car trip without excessive pre-planning is absolutely essential, and the inconvenience of missed meetings, incorrect parking spaces, and having to walk to pick up the car are going to be show stoppers.<p>I think that a better approach is more development of public transportation solutions, including the inclusion of more bike-friendly commuting features in cities. If a combination of bike commuting and public transportation became the norm for US city-dwellers, then it would be far more feasible to cut back in the number of cars (and perhaps eventually get to a point where car sharing was more culturally and logistically feasible).<p>(This is the perspective of someone who doesn't live in downtown NYC/SFO/LA/Seattle; I'm sure going car-less seems a bit more feasible in those very concentrated locations)",1331071406

These people aren't hardened members of violent crime organisations like Gangs or various mobs and are probably very easy to ""break"". On the other side hackers tend to trust each other way to much and share personal details inside their group which makes infiltration very easy. Sure you can be behind 7 proxies when you hack something but that doesn't matter as soon as you start talking to your hacker buddies about your personal life without using OTR or even bothering to sign into chat services with a proxy. As soon you start sharing details about how you're in love with a girl or that you feel depressed or you are about to order pizza at place X it's pretty much over for you.<p>These hacker groups are like a clique a social circle of friends but most ""hackers"" don't think that their ""friends"" will rat them out in a second. Most of them probably have never been interrogated or even any contact with law enforcement and therefor very easy to intimidate.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/06/us-hackers-fbi-informer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/06/us-hackers-...</a>",1331071335

The actions that moderators can take on reddit were built on a laissez faire model of moderation, where anything goes except blatant spam.  This obviously doesn't work very well for moderators who choose to run their subreddits in a different manner, and this happens to be most of the big subreddits, because laissez faire moderation just doesn't work on a large scale.<p>For example, the sole /r/truereddit moderator believes in a laissez faire moderation style, and the subreddit is slowly getting worse and worse as the userbase increases.  Every time a /r/truereddit post makes it to the front page, a virtual swarm of idiocy surrounds the entire subreddit for a few days.<p>But that's the only way the moderation system is designed to work.  There's no way to remove/approve content without training the filter.  If someone submits a codinghorror post to /r/programming that is completely off-topic, the moderators either have to remove it, effectively warning the filter that codinghorror might be spam, or hope that the userbase does the right thing and votes it down.  Usually, they won't, especially the people who are voting from their customized front page, not paying attention to what subreddit something is in.<p>It's broken, and the admins have never really expressed any concerns about this fact.",1331071261

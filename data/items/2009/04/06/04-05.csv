They need to embrace the fact that it's a show, an artificial competition where rule #1 is ""the fights must be interesting to human beings"" and #2 is ""the fight must be fair in the sense that everybody knew this year's rules at the same time and everybody is working under the same rules"".

I am very skeptical of the ability of complicated circuitry to survive on the robot itself, but of course there's no reason not to put the logic up there with the human, getting remote sensor data and issuing commands. <i>Duh!</i> Now we're cooking with fire.

548342,comment,547952,548238,0,0,jballanc,,,"Gah! Ok, apologies. I have to learn to stop over-oversimplifying!<p>What I mean there was this: Mathematical modeling of the evolution of protein folds points toward the impossibility of convergently evolving folds (but not convergently evolving functionality). This implies that two proteins with the same fold can reasonably be assumed to have evolved from a common ancestor protein, even if that conclusion cannot be reached from sequence information.<p>Unfolded proteins (at least, above a certain length) cause problems for living things. Thus, the ability of evolution to freely explore fold-space is constrained. There is some interesting work going on in this space looking at the possibility networks of interrelated folds that don't pass through unfolded intermediates, but I think it's too soon to say, for certain, that these networks are sufficient to generate truly ""novel"" folds.<p>As for the SCOP classification system, my personal view is that it tends to be on the restrictive side. Of course, that's the point of SCOP: to robustly categorize folds. As for PFAM, it's been a while, but last I looked they still don't consider any 3D structural information in their classifications. I guess what I'm trying to say here is that, whether or not ""novel"" protein folds are actively appearing depends on your definition of ""novel"". If I mutate a residue in the middle of a helix that breaks the helix in two, is that a novel fold? If I then insert a few more amino acids and turn that one helix into a helix-turn-helix, is that a novel fold?<p>The theory I alluded to is not my own, but I can admire the logic behind it. The idea is that it is possible to group many folds through sequence and other (i.e. threading) means into derived folds. However, even when you do this, you don't arrive at a rootless tree. Instead, you find that there are somewhere (depending on who you ask) between 800 and 1300 ""roots"" to the fold family tree.<p>Presumably, these roots represent novel abiogenesis events. At the very least, these root folds must have existed before ""modern"" biology (i.e. the sort that cannot tolerate unfolded states) began. Whether they all have a common ancestor or not is very much up for debate, but so far I don't know that we have conclusive evidence one way or the other.<p>To be clear, though, I am guilty of oversimplification in the line you've picked out.",1238993003

It sounded an awful lot to me like they could have just <i>looked</i> for the evidence of the effect they are claiming, and I find myself wondering if they used a model because it was easier, or if they did in fact look and failed to come up with the morally-correct evidence.<p>It's easy; go look at those colleges that didn't consider the test, then compare the statistical outcomes predicted by the SAT for those who took it and what actually happened.

It's probably worth trying to squeeze more money out of them (what do you have to lose by trying?).<p>Tufts has a generally good reputation, though not particularly technical.  Free is good and Boston is good.  You might investigate if you can take high-level CS courses at MIT or Harvard with a Tufts enrollment (I think it's possible, but you'll want to know details).  It's certainly possible to join the MIT culture without actually enrolling there.<p>Yale receives a certain degree of contempt in technical circles.  It's probably possible to get a solid education there, but certainly don't expect the name to open doors.",1238990796

Whether or not that bailout is a good idea is certainly debatable.<p>But it has nothing to do with a different bailout that, without some serious provisions to ensure long term viability, has no chance of working.<p>FWIW, most economists seem to be for the financial bailout and against the auto one.<p>Also the financial one is not a give away, it's an investment. They're taking equity stakes in bailed out companies and enforcing rules to ensure long term viability. The Senate wants the same exact thing with the auto one.",1229075482

But all of the manufacturers vanish in a puff of smoke. Now what do they do? They buy 1 million Japanese cars (made right here in America) per year.<p>Those cars are built with parts from the same suppliers, or other suppliers still largely based in America.

You brought up the whole dancing on the grave of people's jobs thing.<p>He wasn't saying he was happy about the loss of jobs. The loss of jobs is coming one way or another (or so the economists I've read seem to think). Chapter 11 gives them a chance to at least end up viable in the end, creating more jobs in the long term.<p>He is happy that we aren't throwing money down a well. Or that's how I read it.",1229075166

395540,comment,394679,395529,0,0,mattobrien,,,"Good for bankers and bad for banks. Bankers who took more conservative, longer term views during the bubble would have been more likely to lose their jobs, because their short term profits would not have been as large as their peers' who engaged in groupthink/stupidity. So this pay structure effectively weeded out bankers who actually looked out for the long term health of their banks.<p>Simply making banks privately held companies, so the bankers have their own capital on the line in their trades, eliminates this moral hazard. Banks do not have some natural right to be publicly traded companies.",1229074508

They're not dancing on the grave of an industry, they're dancing on the grave of a bill. It's two very different things.

395526,comment,395389,395466,0,0,mattobrien,,,"It's not necessarily the same loss of jobs. The issue here isn't just the Big 3, but all of the secondary industries and suppliers that depend on the Big 3 as clients. If the Big 3 go bankrupt now, there is a not insignificant chance that this could cascade through the supply chains, and actually hurt the Japanese companies with American plants as well. The issue here isn't whether the Big 3 should fail - they have and they should - but whether they should fail right now.<p>Even accepting the hard argument that this bailout would merely forestall restructuring and eventual job loss, if that restructuring can be pushed to a time when the economy isn't in such dire straits, then the bailout could easily be worth it. The timing is clearly the most important factor. Consider Lehman. Lehman (and all of Wall St for that matter) was in a very similar position to the one the hedge fund LTCM was in 1998 - i.e., highly levered and insolvent, thus constituting a systemic risk. In 1998 because the rest of Wall St was healthy, the Fed was able to organize a private bailout of LTCM that prevented a, in hindsight, minor credit crisis from escalating. In 2008, since all of Wall St is essentially insolvent, the Treasury was unable to broker a bailout/merger and unwilling to bail out Lehman with public funds, leading to a catastrophic bankruptcy. The cost of being wrong about Lehman far outweighed what bailing it out would have cost, just as the cost of being wrong about letting the Big 3 fail at this moment could far outweight the proposed $14 billion (admittedly just a first offering).",1229072898

For every goldbricker like the OP there is someone running a 'design competition' where the top prize is having your entry fleshed out by vietnamese contractors working at 1/10th the going rate of any of the contest entrants.<p>There are multiple problems with the social construction of what work is and it's place in our lives, for one thing our society is constructed so that much of what passes for work is in fact random noise, this is more pronounced at large companies where the wastage of time, attention and psychological energy are well worn clichés; but it exists at small companies, and solo acts as well. For another, we are not for the most part able to work effectively; somebody who can pull a reliable twenty minutes of productive flow out of a day can be a miracle worker, especially in a shop where the standards are already low.",1229072706

I&#x27;m sorry to hear about your experiences, and while I don&#x27;t know what I can personally do to help, I hope you know that there are certainly people out there who care about you. Mental illness sucks, and society&#x27;s ingrained stigmas suck, but often individual people (friends, family, random strangers you meet at a coffee shop) can help. I wish you the best.",1414303048

It seems borderline suicidal to go up against them by intentionally hamstringing a new iPhone feature in order to promote an inferior alternative when people have an easy alternative. Google Wallet I could understand - it&#x27;s been woefully underpromoted, and carrier shenanigans have really stood in the way of adoption, but Apple drives adoption like nobody else - I was excited for Apple Pay specifically because I expected it to drive the adoption of NFC at more retailers (which means more Google Wallet support for me!)<p>I wonder who greenlit this thing.",1414303007

I would normally fall into the trap you did, and completely failed Algebra 2 but somehow didn&#x27;t swing back on it..<p>Anyway, the teacher, the girls soccer couch, actually gave us a good amount of time after the lecturing to work on our homework.  And often he would start the class about 10-15 minutes late and I knew it was to give us a chance to polish off the homework.  I recall being in a class of mostly Seniors, and a group of  us always ended up working together.. The baseball teams pitcher, who was actually quite sharp, his friend, and a girl I don&#x27;t quite remember that well.  The teacher encouraged us to move our desks together as needed.  This arrangement worked out fantastically.  We would often divide and conquer the homework, or race through the problems individually.  Both had advantages; somebody(me or the pitcher) would almost always have a particular problem figured out if the rest were stuck.  It created this interaction that was part competitive and part cooperative/supportive.  I suspect we all had fun, learned a lot, and did great on the tests and grades(I did).<p>I had three main takeaways from this:<p>1.)The lectures were focused, dense, and did not take up the entire 90 minutes.<p>2.)We had plenty of time to practice the problems and help each other/get help during the period<p>3.)I now just recall that this was our lunch period as well, which we took the 2nd to last slot, so we had a break before the last bit of the period.  This was quite nice.<p>As an aside, three of the coaches I had for academic classes are probably in my top 5 list.  Their classes were very engaging..  I find this interesting.",1414302584

He&#x27;d be a (starving) artist and not a designer otherwise. Even artists -- great ones -- consider the bottom line.<p>* If someone cares only about giving users great solutions, then they must concern themselves with the bottom line impact. Costs to the vendor and to the consumer determine, to a large extent, how many people will use the solution.<p>* Google and Apple are for-profit businesses not digital art colonies. Returning to my above point, that&#x27;s how they afford to staff so many designers and develop such advanced designs.<p>* For example, I suspect Ives&#x27; ideal iPhone would cost Apple orders of magnitude more than the iPhone 6.

There is a huge difference between the systems, I have lived in both a communist totalitarian country and in US.<p>And the difference is this:<p>US government and the culture as a whole has  much better handle on PR and brainswashing. In the communist regime I know, very few privately believed or respected any of the ideals about the &quot;party&quot;. All those slogans and so on.<p>In contrast in US many believe in fantasies and have a very distorted view of reality. Either that government is totally useless and evil or that one should obey, listen, be proud of it, and sign up to go fight wars on its behalf when it asks you, because it is the &quot;best country in the world&quot;.<p>In rest, effectively, how much power the &quot;lower classes&quot; have is about the same as in the other regime. With some trade-offs. For example.  Here they have the &quot;freedom of speech&quot;. So anyone can grab a megaphone and go stand at the corner downtown, and yell about space lizards. That is nice. In the communist country they would be in an mental institution or maybe a work camp.  Also here they can buy an iPhone, say, if they save enough and maybe sell enough food stamps. But on the other hand, they don&#x27;t get free housing and healthcare. Which is what the communist regime had.",1414302442

Trayvon Martin, police shootings, rampant prison violence. That&#x27;s probably the thing I am least OK with in our society, well that and violence against women, but these are actually a problem with the attitudes of the general population and local governments, not a big bad corrupt federal government.<p>I also think the FBI is a pretty good organization when it comes to fighting political corruption. FBI agents are seriously committed to rooting out corrupt politician, and if anything the FBI&#x27;s capabilities to go after politicians was actually a threat to our democracy when Hoover was running that organization.

8510299,comment,8509854,8509854,0,0,recondite,,,"This story has gotten a lot of play over the past year, but one aspect I haven&#x27;t really seen covered are what, if any, longer-term plans are being proposed to mitigate future water supply issues for the state as a whole. This article mentions efforts by a couple small municipalities to fill reservoirs and provide incentives to conserve, and while this is the right spirit, is orders of magnitude less than what the state needs.<p>The prevailing thought seems to be that the issue is eventually going to take care of itself because (1) at some point this drought will end - which is technically true, and (2) even if it continues on for a while longer market forces will moderate consumption - also true; but both of these come at a very high long-term expense for everybody in California via higher water bills, taxes, and most importantly the permanent loss of agricultural production. These efforts also do <i>nothing</i> to address the next time a drought hits California. The state expects to grow 40% in population by 2060 (not a unique trend worldwide).<p>To me, it&#x27;s a reflection of how fractured the state is: northern vs Bay area vs southern, blue vs red counties, farmers vs everybody else, etc... And while I will argue for distributed over centralized authority any day, the current path the state is on seems insane. For example, San Diego is building its own multi-billion dollar desalination plant: \n<a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_25859513/nations-largest-ocean-desalination-plant-goes-up-near"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_25859513/nations-large...</a><p>certain other communities within California continue to expend 2-4x more water than average - mostly to fill swimming pools and water golf courses - because there is no incentive for either consumers or the water district to conserve at all:\n<a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_25090363/california-drought-water-use-varies-widely-around-state"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_25090363/california-dr...</a><p>and just a couple years ago the state voted to approve construction of an obvious 11-digit pork barrel project, which ironic to my original point, would connect northern and southern California (and Las Vegas, really...)<p>But the point remains, for the supposed &quot;8th largest economy in the world&quot; there is very little in my mind that holds the state together other than tradition. As an anecdote, I used to live in Michigan where our monthly water bill was ~$100/month, and now where I live in the California high desert, I pay only $20 per month more. That&#x27;s only 20% more coming from a state that is literally surrounded by fresh water, to an arid/desert land which primarily gets its water from mountain runoff and other states. This just doesn&#x27;t seem right to me.<p>I guess the potential glimmer in all this, is at some point, it will become economically feasible to ferry icebergs from Antarctica into Long Beach harbor.

A vast number are a letter and a fancy, wavy line. My own &#x27;cursive&#x27; is a mix of print and cursive letters. People can be taught to read cursive without writing it if wanted and some people would, in turn, write cursive.<p>And it isn&#x27;t dead, but it is dying as the benefits (things like quicker writing, concentration, fine motor control) either aren&#x27;t needed as much (typing is faster than writing) or can be replaced by other things (games teach concentration and fine motor control on top of hand-eye coordination and problem solving, and that&#x27;s just the fun games).<p>Additionally, typing is actually a bit easier to learn than cursive because typing doesn&#x27;t depend so much on how &#x27;neat&#x27; it is. Speed is naturally taught over the years - or at least it was the case for me.",1414300258
8510283,comment,8509891,8509891,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"One could argue that Marx himself felt he was witnessing the apocalypse, and yet here we are.<p>My biggest issue with this particular take on it is this, <i>&quot;The consumer vision that is pushed by advertising and which is conquering the world is based fundamentally, as I argued before, on a notion of economic growth.&quot;</i><p>Advertising is not based on growth, it is based on consumption. There is a difference. Let me see if this analogy helps; Survival requires spending money, there is only so much money in the world, once we run out society as we know it will collapse. The fallacy there is two fold, it presupposes that once spent money is destroyed, and secondly that without money society could not operate.<p>People are, for lack of a better term, actors in a large interconnected system, they both charge the system with work and drain the system with consumption. The &#x27;value&#x27; of this system, its GDP, sloshes around from place to place, concentrating at times and dispersing at times. Without its motion, the system stops. Advertising is a means by which actors in the system attempt to get a bit of GDP to slosh their way. They spend some to get some as it were. Sometimes the actors follow along, sometimes they don&#x27;t. I feel that the effect of advertising on the sloshing around of GDP is a second order effect at best.<p>Back when my kids were younger the topic of the richest person in the whole world came up. And the obvious kid question, &quot;What would happen if one person got all of the money in the world?&quot; and the answer is we&#x27;d switch to barter, instead of buying groceries with dollars we might buy them with traded services. GDP or &quot;production&quot; isn&#x27;t money, it is something more fundamental than that. Money is merely a convenient accounting system which works well enough for many cultures.",1414300233

I used FB Connect when it first launched and after disconnecting the site I was spammed pretty regularly with emails about various conversations, but I couldn't remove myself from the mailing list without re-connecting thru FB which I didn't want to do (mostly out of principle), instead  Convore emails all get flagged as junk. I don't see them anymore.<p>I'd also guess that they probably don't get any search engine love if the site and conversations can't be indexed. I don't think Googlebot has a FB account :)<p>Their compete graph is pretty abysmal, granted the real time infrastructure would skew page view counts way down but people still need to navigate to the actual site and you'd think a high profile startup would have more than 2800 unique visitors in a month.",1323723568

3344926,comment,3343664,3344105,10,0,ahoyhere,,,"Don't do it. Go with contractors. Here's the thing: a contractor is running a business, just like you are. If you don't work with them any more, they are not out of ""a job."" Their livelihood is no longer your responsibility. You are only responsible for paying a set amount you agreed for specific work. If they do not deliver, you do not have to fire them. If you can't afford them any more, you do not have to fire them you simply don't renew a contract. If it turns out you don't like them, you do not have to fire them.<p>With contractors, you can also afford to try lots of people without disrupting anyone's lives or running out of money. You have freedom and they have other clients.<p>Firing people is the absolute worst, I can tell you for a fact and I'm a person who fully embraces difficult experiences and has no problem admitting when she's wrong.<p>Even if you want to keep the employee (and based on what I learned & then heard from EVERYONE, the chances you'll keep your first employee are about zero), you will have a hard time sleeping at night because <i>they depend on you</i> and you may find your whole job becomes <i>ensuring you earn enough to pay them.</i> (A good rule of thumb is that you musthave at minimum 150% of their salary on a monthly basis. More for non-US countries.)<p>People will say xyz about contractors -- they're not invested, they have other pots on the stove, blah blah blah. The same is true of employees, but they are harder and so much more painful to get rid of, and it hurts them a lot more. The trick is the right people. Finding the right contractor is absolutely possible, and it's much less stress to be wrong than it is when you are wrong about an employee.<p>For one, you can hire people for small getting-to-know-you projects. You're not going to find it easy to do that with an employee. Moreover, once a person is an employee, their behavior may completely change being employed (and being an employer!) brings out all kinds of crazy psychological crap you never would have believed possible.<p>So, yeah. Don't do it!",1323723558

Agency experience is perceived negatively in the startup community because it's common knowledge that most agencies don't treat developers well.  Mediocre developers often get high rates because there's such a lack of developers willing to put up with the kind of work (stressful, low budget, extremely short deadlines, not much room for polishing).  A developer coming from an ad agency with ""Javascript"" on their resume is likely to only know enough jQuery to get by.<p>That said, it's often possible to differentiate yourself from the crowd by using phrasing that only knowledgeable developers use or listing a more detailed toolset that shows the same (eg: ""Javascript, jQuery"" vs ""OO Javascript, jQuery, Backbone.js"").",1323723195

How do you know that they don't have equal opportunities already?<p>Legal equality is straightforward and very easy to measure.  ""Opportunity"" is highly subjective.

Open-source is a <i>juggernaut</i> on the Windows platform.  MS knows this very well.  They have problems getting users to use their free software (e.g. Internet Explorer) that comes installed on every copy of Windows instead of something that's open source! Of course, while free software does greatly enhance the value users can get out of Windows, it is also a big security problem.  For every awesome open source application there is a shady malware reflection, and users sometimes have problems telling the difference.  Malware is a big reason why Windows gets flak for not being secure.<p>Enter the MS App store.  The only way to sell users on the idea of getting all their software from the app store is for the free software they use to be there waiting for them.  That means even the competition must be there.  Yes, you can expect Chrome and Firefox to be on the MS App store.  Security isn't the only benefit of locking users into an app store though.  The platform ""unification"" MS seems to be striving towards could also benefit from features the app store could have.  e.g. Centrally managed install-bases for all your computers.  Install VLC on your office computer and it winds up on your mobile and home computer too.  Get a new computer?  One click (or less) and everything you installed from the app store on your old machine could be waiting for you on the new machine.<p>Of course, Apple has shown that managing an App store is not without its difficulties.  Slow review processes irk developers, and malicious software can still slip through.  Can MS do better?  Only time will tell.",1323721402

RSS is a technology, not a product. It makes as much sense as asking whether someone is using GSM or TCP. I think a large part of that problem is that the technology appeared before a user-friendly way to consume it. Imagine email addresses being introduced before email clients existed. To most people, clicking on an RSS button displays garbage to the screen. They don't know what to do with it. Even after browsers started displaying RSS feeds in a pretty format, users still didn't know what to do with it. Should they bookmark this link? Why would they consume the barebones RSS feed in their browser instead of the rich and graphical website? RSS enables one to subscribe to a website, it's not the ends but the means. These questions still remain unanswered which is why some people like Gruber and TechCrunch like to claim that Twitter killed RSS, although I think they're completely different things.",1323721276

This is really stupid.  All bosses, from a two person shop to a twenty thousand person shop, should regularly be sitting down with their employees and communicating what that person has been doing well, not doing well, what the boss wants to change, etc.  You don't have to be a hidebound corporation with 100k employees to benefit from being explicit about the manager communicating feedback and from setting aside time for this to explicitly happen.  Not to mention that many founders are learning how to be a manager, and often are far from clear about their expectations.  Making them explicit does nothing but help the relationship.  See also Rands' opinion [1], [2].  Communication doesn't just happen; it's something that is made to happen.<p>Justintv had similar experiences about the benefits of being really clear what a manager wants [3].  Protip: employees don't read minds.  He found that this was the typical project workflow:<p><pre><code>   Vague problem definition: ""Create an automated test suite for the website.""

   Employee defines it in some way that we didn't actually have in mind: ""Create
   an extensible, Selenium based framework for performing every action a user can
   on the site.""
   
   Employee works on that for a while, sometimes months, without feedback: ""I'm
   making great progress!""
   
   Manager checks on progress, has a ""wtf"" moment: ""Wait, I just wanted something
   that pinged five URLs and checked for 500s.""
   
   Massive micromanagement ensues: ""OK, clearly you don't understand what we're
   doing; I'm going to have to take over.""
   
   Massive employee disenchantment: ""WTF just happened?""

3344773,comment,3343475,3343475,14,0,commieneko,,,"I spent a couple of years teaching at a career college in MA.  The problem was not so much dealing with disruptive creative students, and I certainly had several of those, as it was dealing with students that didn't have the prerequisites and mental tools to learn the skills they needed to express themselves usefully.<p>An example: I had one student who spoke very well, he was from Cameroon and in fact spoke _several_ languages, was something of a class leader, he had very good visual ideas and his presentation style was remarkable.  But. He did not know how to read a ruler and fractions were a complete mystery to him.  Algebra was completely beyond him at his current state.<p>He was in a graphic design class and was going into a web programming class, and following that a 3D modeling class.  He often became actively resentful that I was forcing him to focus on things that he considered trivial and not apparently related to the results he wanted.  He very much felt I was stifling his creativity.<p>Convincing him that he would simply fail at his goals without studying some basics was very difficult.<p>We got the fractions and ruler issues licked with some outside class work, but he simply was not able to handle the coding in the web design class and failed. I didn't teach the 3D class, so I don't know how well he did there, but I can only imagine.<p>(One of the reasons I left the school was that with such a wide variety of students with incredibly varied levels of education, I wasn't allowed to adapt the classes to  meet their needs.  I did finally get the school to offer remedial math and reading lessons, but they were <i>not</i> prerequisites and they did no kind of testing to determine need.)<p>My point is that creativity is important, but basic skills often are more important, at least at the beginning.  And no matter how gifted one is, developing the discipline to work on non-interesting and non-creative tasks is essential in the real world.  There are problems that have aspects that are simply beyond hacking and shooting from the hip. And they are often, ultimately, the most interesting and rewarding to solve.",1323720945

Even without the clause in question I doubt you'd ever be able to get a court to declare that Microsoft had to release the source to one of their non-Windows products because you tricked them into distributing a GPL application linked against it, but I can't really blame lawyers for being cautious in an untested area.",1323720215

3344727,comment,3343664,3343664,4,0,akg,,,"I usually use the criteria of ""What does this person do in their spare time?"" There should be two things that they should be doing:<p>1. They should be coding all the time. Not just for their current job, but because they genuinely like it. They may not be able to write a red-black tree in your 5minute coding quiz, but if they are truly passionate about coding and technology they will bring a wealth of knowledge with them. More so, they will have lots of exposure to new technologies, ideas, and have good ties in the community.<p>2. They should be passionate about the industry you are in. I would expect half of the Spotify team to be almost deaf by now, because they are listening to music all day long -- and loving it.<p>It's hard to find people that will fit both, but you should at least settle for the point 1. Especially now, with public code repositories like Github, it is easy to see the quality of code that most people can churn out and how passionate they are about engineering good solutions.",1323720213

I actually did a lot of work for fairly large ad agencies and I still only knew Chiat Day from your list (I did work for them, never heard of the others).<p>The bottom line is, nobody cares. They care about what you say you've done and what you have actually done, and the passion you bring to your cover letter or whatever. The names on the resume won't mean anything to them.<p>The bigger problem is you've been stewing in the ad agency world and think other people outside it know wtf it's about.<p>(Having some of that bg myself, I would be very hesitant to hire someone from an ad agency unless they told me in very clear uncertain terms why and how broken it is. On the flip side, I know way more people at ad agencies who actually ship than I do at any other large organizations.)",1323720190

Yes my comments may have been polarizing. I don't think you understand the opportunity cost of always saying what you think people want to hear.<p>I've gotten a lot of opportunities by speaking my mind to and rubbing influential people the wrong way initially. They give me attention they normally would not give, and in debating with me give me more respect in the end than had I just championed the status quo.

First, it is indeed true that traditional forms of programming are useful for just a few people. But, programming as we the authors understand it is useful for everyone: the administrative secretary who uses spreadsheets as well as the high-tech programmer. In other words, we have a broader notion of programming in mind than the traditional one. We explain our notion in a moment. Second, we teach our idea of programming with a technology that is based on the principle of minimal intrusion. Hence our notion of programming teaches problem-analysis and problem-solving skills without imposing the overhead of traditional programming notations and tools.""[1]<p>If you are already a programmer, there is a commentary from Matthias Falleisen about how you should read the book:<p>""If you are an experienced programmer, you should read HtDP like this:<p><pre><code>  -- read the sections whose title starts with ""Designing ....""
  -- also read the ""iterative refinement"" sections
  -- pick five exercises in the preceding and/or follow-up sections  </code></pre>
and solve them according to the recipe
  -- unless you're stuck move forward
  -- try to understand the ""symmetry"" between data definitions and  
templates<p>I expect that somewhere around late part II, you will slow down. You  
may pick up real reading as of part III, though some may make it thru  
III and only ""stutter"" in IV.<p>Also:<p><pre><code>  -- use check-expect to express your examples/tests
  -- avoid draw.ss exercises, replace them with world.ss but that's a  </code></pre>

Couch surfing seems more like a lifestyle thing, but airbnb you could perhaps even depend upon for your stay.<p>I've tried couchsurfing. I tried contacting three people, never heard from any of them. Perhaps I didn't write appealing messages, not sure what the reason was. Or maybe they just signed up and aren't really into couchsurfing anymore. It feels like being a guy on a dating site, you put a lot of effort into writing messages and you are never quite sure if you are just wasting your time.<p>I don't like where this analogy is going, but suffice it to say that finding the service you need is easier when some money is involved. I have to admit that on airbnb the first person ignored us too, but with the second one we now have a reservation. Our trip is still in the future, so it remains to be seen if everything goes well, but we are optimistic.<p>I think which is for you, couchsurfing, airbnb or just a hotel really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for friends and really adventurous, couchsurfing does seem promising. If you can't spend hours trying to hunt down a place to stay, but don't like the sterility and expense of a full-blown hotel, airbnb might be the answer. Our next trip is to Boston, and we got (or are promised) a full apartment for our use for a lot less than the price of a hotel. Still, if you stricly need a place to stay that is absolutely dependable and hassle-free, then go for a hotel.",1256777333

909240,comment,908557,909045,0,0,liuliu,,,"sorry, I wrote these down in a math class in rush.<p>I think the copy-cat thing in China is overrated. Sure there are many copy-cats, which are somehow successful in domestic market. But there also many innovations are going on in China. Especially the innovation in monetization, micro-payment etc. There are a few examples:<p>1. Tencent in China is the first company that made their success solely based on the virtual good market (Same as Zynga's sales in Farmville etc.). They sell virtual costume for several cents and accumulated massive profit. And that is year 2003, for the note, online payment is very immature in China at that time. Tencent sold prepaid card from Internet cafe. That works, people bought prepaid card (usually for 5 RMB or 10 RMB) to pay the furnitures in their virtual home etc.<p>2. mop.com, back in 2004 (or 2005, I cannot recall correctly), developed the first web-based online game. It is a typical RPG game, but the innovation is that it requires no Flash, no plugins, no downloads. There is a reason for the development. The main visitor group of mop.com (a popular forum, like 4chan) is office worker, which have many spare time on computer but have no permission to download online games, this game just filled the hole. Another notable thing about mop.com is, it is also the company behind xiaonei.com, the largest copy-cat of facebook.com. Chinese companies are more realistic, and many have such hybrid gene of copy-cat and innovation.<p>3. China Mobile, the largest mobile service provider in China launched a product (actually a website for mobile phone) in 2003 called monternet which expect to provide all the applications/contents that needed for mobile phone users. It is so convenient in that time: you just need to click a link, and the payment will go to your next month phone bill (remember the situation I described about online-payment in 2003's China?). That is the model of iPhone's AppStore which get all the buzz recent years except it was launched by a ISP. The application sale part failed after one or two years because of the popular pirate software and wide adaption of symbian S60 OS in 2003 (made the universal compatibility is not necessary for most people).<p>Few months ago, my friend's words that online-casual game has no market in U.S. because ""the market was dominated by game console"" and the recent booming of Zynga/Playfish/Playdom made me think that there maybe no much difference between Chinese and U.S. market, some innovations in China may be suitable for U.S. market too. Some failures, like the monternet case may also have some indications for current U.S. mode (<a href=""http://games.slashdot.org/story/09/10/24/0136250/App-Store-Developer-Speaks-Out-On-Game-Piracy?from=rss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://games.slashdot.org/story/09/10/24/0136250/App-Store-D...</a>).<p>There are many innovations happened in China, and meeting true innovators in China are quite a pleasure thing for myself. Some innovations can even get global success from my perspective. but lacking of financial support, bad government policies against startup made the first-time-entrepreneur hard to succeed. But for copy-cat or serial-entrepreneur, they are simply much more capital friendly.",1256777071

909236,comment,909034,909172,0,0,btilly,,,"Wrong context.  The amount of money raised is a function of how much money is chasing that particular kind of deal.  A better context is the current cost of doing business.  The inflation adjusted costs of computers, licensing, and marketing are all down.  Therefore startups need less funding, not more.<p>People forget that there is a cost to receiving too much funding, which is that you now need a success that justifies the money spent.  Which means that if you spot a viable opportunity which is smaller than that target, you can't explore it.  Even though in other circumstances it could have been perfectly appropriate for that company.<p>For an interesting book that covers the dynamics of how over-funding kills success, I highly recommend <i>The Innovator's Solution</i>.  It is a follow-up to <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i>, but the discussion of how money distorts organizational dynamics is only in the sequel.",1256777004

If you are on HN you are probably a startup with out funding. They will charge you an arm and a leg. You can do better on your own.  Be passionate about your product - people will respond more to that, then anything else.<p>2. Make your product sexy.  Sexy sells.  A new way of using mobile phones is more interesting than a new DB model.  If it is not an inherently sexy product, make sure it looks professional.  People want to write about companies that 'feel' professional.<p>3. Come up with a story.  ""we are two guys who sold baseballs for 3 years and worked on this in our spare time.""  ""the recession hit, and we both lost our jobs, and this was the result.""<p>4. Reach out to reporters.  Every newspaper/magazine/tv news show now lists reporters emails.  Reach out to them; tell your story.  Find them, and buy them a drink.  They are often young and looking for cool stories.<p>5. Network your face off.

Simplistic 'answers' will fail.<p>I'm reminded of many attempts at educational software. Too often the programmers clearly had a limited view of what constitutes education. You can't design your way out of your own limited perspective. Research has to precede theory; else you wind up with solutions to the wrong problems.<p>Proprietary solutions tend to be more passionate about making money than at helping people.

In particular you say<p><i>If you find that rationality and logic indicate that an individual should not vote, then you haven't used enough of them.<p>Specifically, if everyone was rational according to the definition you're implying, then bad things would happen. That sounds to me like it's the wrong definition.</i><p>You have reasoned from the premise to an apparently absurd conclusion, and therefore conclude that the premise was wrong.  But in fact what you should do is look farther to see whether the premise is, in fact, RIGHT!  To that end I strongly recommend that you read <i>The Logic of Collective Action</i> by Mancur Olson.  This sets out the classic theory of public goods which, among other things, concluded that very often bad things happen if everyone acts in their own self interest.<p>Now rather than seek a reason to reject the premise, analyze it.  My claim is that if your reason for voting is X (for any particular X you want), then unless your act of voting has a chance of affecting X, you logically shouldn't spend energy voting.  Why would that be?  Well when you vote you have a cost (your effort) and a reward (something you care about becomes more likely).  If your expended effort has essentially chance of resulting in a reward, then logically that effort was wasted.<p>This applies whether X is ""get the election outcome you want"" or ""makes politicians care about the electorate"" (which is the reason you gave for why people should vote) or anything else.  If your vote isn't the deciding factor one way or another, then it is a waste of energy for you to vote.  And that applies to both of the criteria I just listed.<p>In fact if you want to make politicians care it is far, far more effective to send an email, make a phone call, or send a piece of snail mail.  Then you get to not just make them aware that someone is out there, but you actually get to tell them your specific concerns.  Now odds are that you won't sway them.  But the effort involved is on part with voting, and it is much more effective.  So if you're willing to vote to make them care, you should send email about something every weekend!<p>When you look at things this way, my voting actually is logically defensible.  After all the warm fuzzies I get from my emotional reaction to voting is a guaranteed return on effort that justifies the effort I expend.  There is no question that the act of my voting makes the difference in my getting that feeling.  So it makes sense for me to vote.",1256775784

909198,comment,908513,908513,0,0,bastian,,,"This is a brilliant decision. I attended Startup School this weekend, and used the event and the surrounding parties to pitch our idea to at least 10+ Y-Combinator startups. Every time i pitched our company i learned something new and got great feedback on how to pitch it better next time. Startups that are concerned about this, should realise that to be accepted to Y-Combinator is not the goal of your startup. It is more than everything else a great test for yourself. Are you able to explain your idea in a couple of sentences, do you have a great founding team, is there really a market for what you are building? Trust me, when i remind you that making your company succeed is much harder than filling out the Y-Combinator application form.<p>Having other startups validating your idea is a great way to actually proof your team, competence and idea. We're based in London and despite the fact that we were lucky enough to know a couple of YC startups, that gave us great feedback on our application, we're thrilled to know that our idea, our team and our startup will be reviewed by a couple of other great YC startups.<p>Mark Zuckerberg, probably put it best during his Startup School talk. He told the audience that instead of going for the universities that really wanted to use Facebook, they rolled out Facebook to the universities that seemed the least interested in it. I think this is a brilliant move to test your product. The same applies here.<p>Good luck to everyone!",1256775530

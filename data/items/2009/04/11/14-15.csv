It's definitely no good to end up in a market of one.<p>P.S. Andrew, it's too bad we didn't hook up when I was out in Victoria last summer. Are you coming to Toronto any time soon, by any chance?<p>Lu, similarly, I was just in SFO in January but I didn't reach out. My bad.

It all depends on the details... but if you're not sure what they are keep it simple.<p>Depending on what you feel more confortable with you could either slap ubuntu on an old computer, or take a small slice at slicehost. The second has less bandwith (then a local computer) but overall it's much more flexible.",1239461175

557485,comment,557456,557456,0,0,jackowayed,,,"OK, you're pretty ambiguous on what you want, but based on ""easy to move to a collocation center"" and ""GUI isn't required"" it sounds like you're mostly asking about servers.<p>For initial development, you probably don't even need a server. There's pretty much always an easy way to have a local server run on your computer for development.<p>When you are ready for a server (probably not until you're about ready to go live), I'd suggest Slicehost. They're well-documented and cheap ($20/mo. for their smallest server!), and you can scale the server all the way to 15.5GB of RAM in just a couple of minutes.<p>You could look at Linode too though. It seems like you get a little more RAM for your buck, especially on the smaller end, but you can only go to ~2.8 GB of RAM on one server.<p>As for your development computer, I love Ubuntu, but it really depends what you want. If you want to do everything through an IDE, it depends on your language, but the best IDE may be for Windows. If you want to do much of anything through the command line or think you might in the future, develop on either Mac or Linux. Their shells are just way better. There is always Cygwin, which sorta fixes the problem, but I think true Unix works better.",1239460325

557483,comment,557446,557446,0,0,jballanc,,,"Having experience in this field, I'm usually very cautious about the sort of over-exuberance displayed in this article. First of all, the title is misleading. The 100,000x speed up is vs the uncatalyzed reaction, not vs some other enzyme. As enzymes go, that makes the man-made protein still about 4-6 orders of magnitude (10,000-1,000,000x) slower than the best enzymes.<p>There is a lot of interesting research going on in this field, but I worry that, like much of modern science, the focus is too much on ""how can I turn this into a product"" and less on ""have we answered all the questions"". The way I was taught was that Scientists answer the questions, and Engineers come up with the applications. What we have today is a lot of Scientists acting like Engineers.<p>One such unanswered question: How do we factor in entropy? (I did my Ph.D. prelim exam on that topic... If anyone is interested -- <a href=""http://github.com/jballanc/prelim/raw/9a4ab5287b6776b9987834838e0a9b8a7be2c3f0/prelim.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jballanc/prelim/raw/9a4ab5287b6776b9987834...</a>) What's interesting about that topic is the way that we're applying new approaches and algorithms to the questions being asked. So, while the future of this field is certainly bright, we're still at the head-down keep-pushing-forward stage...<p>...keep the champaign on ice for now.",1239460060

557476,comment,556767,557184,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"A great deal of this is similar to the findings on management and creativity and/or stress and creativity.<p>Stress kills creativity because it creates a chemical reaction that forces your mind to focus intently and over-rely on previous experience. This might help if you need to run away from a bear, but might hinder if you're trying to solve a tricky problem that requires exploring and potentially letting go of assumptions.<p>Similarly it's very tricky to ""manage"" creativity or any task where you can't specify and measure either the process or the outcome (preferably both). You may sadly realise this covers most white collar work but it only really gets talked about in relation to obviously 'creative' things like advertising and R&D.<p>The basic of management there is ""don't"", though there are some things that help such as ""clan controls"" where you hire people with a particular value set (e.g. scientists or open source programmers) and encourage them to be evaluated, outside of work, by their peers.<p>It might be worth pondering a comparison between an leading advertising agency work areas and Google's famous playgrounds.<p>This guy proposes that the bits of the company that can be managed traditionally (sales, clerical workers) thrive on (or are even addicted to) continual stress and this causes a hidden rift between them and the programmers (etc.) who absolutely require at least some time in the stressless mindset in order to do their job.",1239458857

Paul Krugman is right - Obama has made serious error in trying to restart the finance machine.""</i><p>I think you're painting things with a very broad brush. While it's certainly true that there's a financial crisis of global proportions, it's also true that there's a whole world out there outside of the U.S., and that world is not under Obama's influence.<p>Are quants bankrupt? Well, maybe in NYC. But NYC has not been the world's financial capital for a few years now. London has. And Shanghai is emerging pretty fast...<p>A friend of mine who's a grad student at a top 5 math department in the U.S. was invited to join D.E. Shaw recently. Another friend just finished her MSc at MIT and will take a quant position in an investment fund... in East Asia ;-) Circumstances don't look cheery for sure, but just because the U.S. is depressed, it doesn't mean other parts of the world are equally depressed.",1239458746

I think it&#x27;s more likely that most of the time these elections are a close call and campaigning sways people who are in the middle or motivates people who might not otherwise vote.<p>The argument basically just implies that advertising has some influence. Which is true - even for an educated and informed audience. Nothing you do to the electorate can make them immune to advertising. So money will always be a motivation for politicians. Especially since extra campaign money can always be spent on all kinds of fun expenses, and giving well paying jobs to friends and family.<p>Also, bear in mind that even the most well informed educated electorate has a very limited feedback mechanism. Many people care so strongly about particular issues that they will never change their vote. Which means people in the middle ground only really get to choose between the two main political parties. In practise, it works out a bit like a price fixing cartel. Basically both parties take turns screwing everyone over. Candidates only have to make the appearance of being better than the last guy during election time. During their last term they can do whatever they want, which sets the bar really low for the next guy. It&#x27;s a race to the bottom.<p>As long as the influence of money is present, politicians will behave as corruptly as they can get away with.

7639216,comment,7637278,7638893,6,0,kazagistar,,,"I was a bit unnerved by the single variable names as well. But frankly, using full world variables adds little actual clarity  in most cases where they are used. What the variables are is clear from the types, and what the types are is usually stated very clearly within a few lines, barely a glance away for reference. I will concede however that the python example could use variable names for clarity, since no such types are stated nearby. I have found that long variable names don&#x27;t help, and sometimes even hinder my understanding of haskell code.<p><pre><code>    foldRight :: (accum -> item -> item) -> accum -> foldable item -> accum\n    foldRight combiner initialAccum foldables = appEndo (foldMap (Endo . combiner) foldables) initialAccum\n</code></pre>\n... that didn&#x27;t help. After all, each variable was used once, and there were only 3 variables in the entire scope. Most functions are like that, and you can easily keep track of it without breaking a sweat. What is important to keep track of is what types those are, and what functions are valid for those types, and how those types are changed with function application and whatnot.<p>So its not just because of the test example. I actually copied and pasted the original out of the standard library, so it is about as canonical as it gets. The best possible description for f is (a -> b -> b), and while you might hand wave it as a &quot;combiner&quot; or &quot;accumulationStep&quot; or whatnot, that does almost nothing to clarify how this function works.<p>The cultural choice is not arbitrary. The real cultural difference is in the level of abstraction so often being &quot;above&quot; the semantics. In java, or python, or whatever else, I will religiously use nice, expressive names. But the short names, and other even crazier things like pointfree syntax actually feel somewhat more natural in Haskell.",1398334506

7817573,comment,7802790,7817303,1,0,kbenson,,,"I think the problems with your argument boil down to a few thigs:<p>1) You seem to be making an argument for some future language.  That it would drop many of the things the make Perl Perlish is presupposed as what &quot;people&quot; would want.  It would keep the name, as you state, because it would be the same community of people.  The community of people that would keep the Perl name are not the same &quot;people&quot; you refer to that after their complaints are fixed would result in a Perl that is not Perlish.<p>2) If you are just talking about some abstract future language not actually related to Perl, don&#x27;t use the Perl name.  All you are doing is getting people riled up because you are attributing views to them (as the actual Perl community) that they disagree with.  Again, I think this can be attributed to you taking a more abstract approach to what you are saying, but choosing to use concrete names, such as Perl, and doing so <i>in the comments of an article about a new Perl release</i>.  People here would likely engage you gladly if it was obvious it&#x27;s just a thought experiment about some futuristic language with nothing to do with Perl, including the name (although there would be challenges as to what you believe are the best features for this new language).<p>3) You presuppose it&#x27;s a solved question of what&#x27;s &quot;best&quot; for specific language features.  For example, longer more explicit keywords, very simple to explain, very easy to read by a someone who doesn&#x27;t know it.  These are all good things when you try to maximize learning by novices.  One could argue that at the same time, they don&#x27;t really even allow experts.  We have domain languages because they allow us to be more concise and accurate in our definitions.  This necessitates learning the domain language, but I think few would argue that the hassle outweighs the future benefit to chemists, physicists, lawyers, engineers and architects to learn the specifics of the domain languages and representations they&#x27;ve developed.  As a simple example, look at Ten Hundred Words of Science[1].  I admit it&#x27;s probably useful to get laymen to understand a topic <i>in general</i>, but is it always sufficient to explain the specifics of that topic in the precise way it requires?  Should experts in the field converse with each other this way?  Should new bodies of work attempt to use this in the future instead of the domain languages they have developed?  It&#x27;s important to see these for what they are, tools used to shift focus towards or away from specific attributes.  It&#x27;s all a matter of perspective and what the goal is.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://tenhundredwordsofscience.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tenhundredwordsofscience.tumblr.com/</a>",1401385916

But the reason there was no competing OS to run on SPARC is not the same reason that there is no competing OS to run on iPhone. In the case of SPARC the lack of OS competition was not a result of any interference on the part of Sun. When Linux was subsequently ported to SPARC they made no effort to prevent it, I imagine they probably did most of the work. In the case of iPhone the lack of OS and app store competition is directly a result of Apple thwarting it. It is extremely likely that at least one of Android/Ubuntu/FirefoxOS/etc. would be ported to iPhone hardware in the alternative, and that Amazon or others would be operating competing app stores. So the existence of hardware competition was not the only thing saving Sun from an antitrust violation -- even if they had a strong hardware monopoly their behavior wouldn&#x27;t have been an abuse of it. Apple is behaving differently. Its behavior is distinguishable from that of Sun in a way that makes an antitrust violation significantly more plausible. There is a much stronger argument that Apple exerts monopoly power over the market for iOS applications than Sun ever did over the market for Solaris applications. Which part of this do you deny?<p>> Well, the low allows it and companies have been doing it for ages, e.g with game consoles.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how clear that is. Was there an antitrust case against a game console maker in which they were vindicated? Just because the government has never prosecuted anyone doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a violation. Antitrust law is about as clear as mud and they rarely prosecute anybody even in cases of much less nuanced violations.",1401385559

While I agree with what you&#x27;re saying, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to convince most people here of that.<p>Professional football is by far the most respected profession here. Top of the food chain. Of course, most teenagers recognize they aren&#x27;t going to make the high school team, let alone make it into the professional realm. If you do make the team, well, try as hard as you can. And of course, most people still don&#x27;t make it, there&#x27;s just not enough demand for pro football players. But it&#x27;s still a huge thing that people aspire to. If you do make it, everyone is going to speak of you with awe. There&#x27;s a couple guys who grew up near where I did and every single person who knew them or knew of them (anyone you meet will eventually bring them up in conversation) speaks of them with total reverence - they _made it_.<p>Unless your parents are wealthy and/or well-educated, most people don&#x27;t have a &quot;career&quot; as such in mind - just jobs. Football stands out - especially since the perception is that the only other professional careers boil down to things like &quot;doctor&quot; or &quot;lawyer&quot; which (so the thinking goes) require highly exceptional intelligence beyond the ken of most people, and anyway, they aren&#x27;t nearly as glorious or high-paying. So it&#x27;s all about aspiration - and in some places, pro sports is at the top, even if you or I think it constitutes a terrible or unrealistic career choice.<p>Now, in my experience, that aspiration is strongly correlated not so much with race but with your family&#x27;s educational history, professions, and income. &quot;Rich&quot; kids (parents with income > 60k) grow up in an environment where they really understand there are other opportunities out there. They&#x27;re more likely not just to go to college, but grow up believing that college is an inevitability  and part of life. A ton of kids never even get that far. I think that&#x27;s the kind of kid he&#x27;s talking about.",1401384742

Now take the top 100 [say] performers: sometimes [within an instance of the experiment] their modal sex will be the same as the better performing group, sometimes it will differ but I&#x27;d warrant across repetitions of the experiment the modal sex of the top performers is largely stable across many fields.",1401383828

It&#x27;s like someone staying out of jazz (or the NBA) because they look at its history and think &quot;it&#x27;s all black people, there&#x27;s no place for me there&quot; instead of &quot;it&#x27;s all creative and brilliant musicians (or talented athletes), I would love to be a part of that&quot;.<p>I get that this might be a problem that&#x27;s not easily solvable so we should explore other avenues as well, but it&#x27;s bizarre to me that we seem to be embracing that sort of reduction of human beings into a single physical characteristic, instead of identifying it as a big part of the problem.",1401383340

And right now, the major imprints are a signal of quality -- such-and-such publisher decided this book was good enough to spend money on. Not to say that can&#x27;t be addressed in this new world, but it&#x27;s unclear how it&#x27;s going to be addressed and what the tradeoffs are.<p>Also, by democratizing books, you may end up drastically altering the compensation structure. Right now, you have a relative small number of people like Stross who are able to make their living writing novels, and a larger number of people who don&#x27;t ever &quot;make it.&quot; A more open book-publishing market may mean fewer Strosses can make a living as an author, and more and more people who are novelists do it in addition to their primary job, rather than as their primary job.<p>So yeah, there&#x27;s a very real chance that this new world of publishing does &quot;destroy&quot; something. And something else will get built. And there&#x27;ll be tradeoffs, and some people will win, and others will lose. Right now it&#x27;s really hard to say whether or not society as a whole will be better off. The thing about Stross&#x27;s argument is that historically, there&#x27;s very little precedent for being able to stave off social changes instigated by technological disruption.

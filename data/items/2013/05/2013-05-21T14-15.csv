The best thing to do is to keep up to date on what's happening in the Nimrod world, breaking changes are rare but when they do happen they are announced in the changelog on the Nimrod website and in the Nimrod repo on github, IRC is also a good way to stay up to date. I started my contributions to Nimrod by basically writing and improving the standard library as well as creating random fun toy projects. I've also seen other people learning the language by contributing to all sorts of Nimrod projects on github, mainly my Aporia repo which includes a todo list and is generally pretty easy to modify as it's still quite small.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/nimrod-code/Aporia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nimrod-code/Aporia</a> [2] <a href=""https://github.com/nimrod-code/nimbuild"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nimrod-code/nimbuild</a> [3] <a href=""https://github.com/dom96/jester"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dom96/jester</a>",1369148318

In my experience, I've found that these type of candidates have the highest chance for success, regardless of the type of formal training that they may or may not have had.<p>The ones that I'm a bit more suspect on are the ones that think about getting into this industry mostly because of articles like this that focus on the ""OMG he's making $$$ 6-figures"", but that have never shown much of a prior interest for software, programming, etc..

I compared the curriculum at the little private college I graduated from almost a decade ago to the current curriculum of the local state-U today and you can escape typically with about 3 classes of pure software coding, the rest of the degree is ""other computer stuff"" aside from the liberal arts.  For me it was two semesters of C++ and believe it or not, COBOL.  I already had a job in the field and wanted to expand my horizons, so ""learning"" what I already do at work would have completely missed the point.  COBOL was in fact a total trip and pretty wild experience, although I'm glad I don't have to earn a living coding it.<p>Over the last decade not much has changed.  You'll have a data structures type class although most grads seem to completely forget everything taught.  Typically some kind of theory of languages/theory of computing/computability/scaling.  Everyone still suffers thru intro to databases complete with explanations of codd-normal forms and drawing E-R diagrams and such.  Everyone suffers thru an intro to operating systems class.  Everyone has some sort of intro to algorithms, aka welcome to Knuth, class.<p>""learn to code java"" is probably less than 10% of the total class time.  All the upper level classes I took demanded some form of working code but they didn't care what language.  Remember its education not job training.  They thought psuedocode was fine on tests.<p>Three notable changes:
1) No more discrete math.  Huh?  Even with discrete math most grads seem mystified by multiple simple conditionals.  Maybe its rolled into the first lectures of theory of computing or whatever.
2) No more required systems analysis.  Maybe its kinda rolled into ""software engineering""  ...perhaps.
3) Capstone project senior year type things seem very popular now a days.  I donno if that's in addition to, or in replacement of, the liberal arts survey class I had to take in my last semester.",1369148003

But I didn't always use it; before I started, I used a couple of passwords everywhere.  Recently some site which I haven't even used in years was compromised, and as a result, one of my ""frequently used passwords"" was potentially compromised.  I had to spend hours going to dozens of websites and changing my password.  Every site has a different way to change your password, and different policies for acceptable passwords, and most don't even make it easy/obvious.<p>I think something like Mozilla Persona is a good start, but not quite complete.  Give me one, central place to manage my identity.  The ability to control which sites have access to my identity.  The ability to allow, or not allow, different sites to correlate my identity with each other.  The ability to have my identity independent of my email address.  Good two-factor auth for establishing identity, and good password management policies.  Single-sign-on, even across independent sites, with just a click.<p>So the problem is that a proposal like this encourages people to do the wrong thing; i.e. ask me for a username and password - without two-factor auth, without considering whether I will be able to manage yet-another-password, without considering whether they should even be in the business of authentication themselves.",1369146130

Kudos for pulling it off, but the thing ain't magic.<p>For starters, it has blades. It definitely has blades.  They are simply concealed.  It's like saying my computer has no fans when the fans are not visible from the outside.  Nonsense.<p>Second, it takes a certain amount of power to accelerate a mass of air to a given speed.  That does not change magically because the thing has a Dyson sticker on it.  The most efficient way to accelerate a mass of air is, wait for it, a properly designed fan.  It am pretty certain the Dyson contraption is actually much less efficient than a properly designed plain fan which produces the same airflow.  It absolutely could  not be more efficient, no way.  Nowhere in conventional physics do you get more --of anything-- than you are entitled to.<p>In fact, the larger the fan the more efficiently it can accelerate a mass of air. Because the Dyson fans are constrained by the small space of the base they have to use screaming little fans to push against the back-pressure produced by the path the air has to follow.<p>Maybe not as sexy, but a really well designed fan with optimized airfoils and balanced rotor IS magical in the sense that it can be so much better than the stamped metal contraptions one usually finds at the store.  I have seen fans like that come-up here and there but they are rare.<p>I did a project many years ago where we had to design and optimize an efficient cooling system for a 1500 Watt LED array.  We ultimately ended-up going with a hybrid fluid/air system.  However, for the bulk of the project we tried to make an air-only approach work because it was deemed simpler and easier to manufacture.  I learned a lot from running tons and tons of FEA fluid and thermal simulations as making a number of prototypes. There is no free lunch (AKA: Conservation of Energy).",1369146116

There is no room in the spec for pages that change their meaning depending on whether you are logged in or not.<p>Of course, one could argue that ""logged in"" pages should have different URLs, eg., /logged_in/*, and just use auth for those. The problem with that approach is that if you go to any resource not within that URL namespace, such as the front page, auth isn't necessarily sent by the browser, and so you can't know if the user is logged into the other parts of the site.<p>Nor is there anything that supports the notion of ""login sessions"" -- once you're authenticated, you can't un-authenticate, as far as I know. We actually have a payment provider (DIBS, a Scandinavian company) that uses basic auth for their admin login. The only way to log out of their admin, such as in order to log into a different account, is to clear the browser state.<p>And lastly, the login popup that browsers currently provide for basic auth is poorly implemented and altogether too simple.

You do not need billions for that. The truth is that even if you want billions you do not necessarily need a whole lot of space for them, if you examine the total area of arable land on earth and how many people you can pack into a city the space requirements are not as large as one might first assume if you have climate controlled growing conditions and a 100% urban population.<p>I have read a lot of material about the energy required to sustain some sort of colony on Mars but I have never read anything estimating the kind of energy strategy required for terraforming or <i>building</i> a substantial colony. This is why I have doubts about it, I do not see it being properly considered. For example most of the terraforming schemes involve the generation of greenhouse gases, creating a more opaque atmosphere and nullifying the thin atmosphere advantage.

The sentiment I'm seeing is that developers and business owners are developing a sense that Google will do <i>just that</i>. It's the impact on the Google-user relationship that is suffering. What you've stated is the cause, not the effect.<p>> Why is trying new services out a bad thing?<p>For whom; Google, or the end-user? In the short term, it looks great for Google. ""Hey, we've got piles of money and resources; let's just try everything!"" This sucks for the end-user though, because we don't all have piles of money and resources lying around to cover switching costs.<p>When you bootstrap a start-up, you learn a very valuable skill set: do something with next-to-nothing. Google's offerings are often enticing, because they're low cost, and often free when they start out. Then the attention of those responsible for Google's bottom line begin to narrow in on the service, and the hard questions start coming. How will this service turn a profit? How will this service support our core offering? How much resources is this service consuming? Would those resources be better spent elsewhere?<p>Those are all perfectly valid questions for Google. From the entrepreneur's side of the table though, they're frightening as hell. What happens when you integrate these services in to your business plan, only to have Google shift their offering to make more sense for Google? The entrepreneur is already engaged in the fight of their life just trying to develop their product and acquire customers. The stability of the underlying services that drive their business becomes a significant factor in their success or failure.<p>> Are they supposed to be perfect?<p>No, of course not. However, it would be nice if Google chose to make a serious commitment to new products, rather than launching every product as a test/beta. Still, it's their choice, just like it's the entrepreneur's choice to avoid their ""beta"" products after having had the rug pulled out from under us in the past.",1369144816

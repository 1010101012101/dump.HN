(for crypto-coins &quot;exploits&quot; can mean economic design issues which can&#x27;t necessarily be fixed with code changes) The very short block interval makes attacks like selfish mining easier to try out for instance. Similarly because they kept the 1MB blocksize limit, but with a 10x shorter 1m interval, it gives insight into what Bitcoin would look like if the blocksize limit was raised.<p>Keep in mind that most people in the crypto-coin dev/theory community don&#x27;t actually own that many coins, and in any case are insiders that can easily move their coins to whatever crypto-currency is most likely to grow. The smart people aren&#x27;t wedded to any particular currency, but rather the growth of crypto-currencies in general.

Everybody knows hashmap is used to lookup key-value pairs. The real reason for not using hashmap here are:<p>1. hashmap&#x27;s lookup Big O is O(n), but not the build cost. if the data set size is huge, it takes long time to build the hashmap since every new element exceeded the initialCapacity being added needs a rehash<p>2. the underlying implementation of indexOf() will use a sort of algorithm called &quot;automata&quot; or something else to do a fast search within a string.<p>So there are lots of alternative solutions. Don&#x27;t always think there is only one. I&#x27;m not in this field, and I&#x27;m not interesting to get into to it too much. But I don&#x27;t think the best answer is that tiny change.<p>This is why I suggested to consider if you are doing application level optimization or changing system level algorithm.

7107171,comment,7106377,7107057,2,0,patcheudor,,,"Alex, thank you for your response.  I don&#x27;t think my original observations about the wording of a support doc falls into a vulnerability disclosure.  That doc has since been updated with enhanced guidance which addresses my original concern.  As I think we all understand, the merchant must be responsible for ensuring the integrity and security of the HTTP response containing the reference to Stripe.js.  After that they are absolved of the requirements surrounding the transmission, processing, and storage of the card data.  As the PCI DSS states, they are ultimately responsible for their PCI compliance as the merchant.",1390457026

Certainly if the merchants web site is compromised, Stripe&#x27;s PCI compliance won&#x27;t prevent or detect the loss of credit card data (since it never reached the point where Stripe could protect it).",1390456906

For example: if the dose is concentrated in the skin, couldn't that be a good thing? Our skin is constantly bombarded with ionizing radiation. UV rays, alpha and beta particles, etc. When it comes to these sorts of insults, the skin is one of the most resilient organs.<p>But instead of arguments, we can look at the evidence. The FDA is notoriously risk-averse, but it has done studies on the safety of backscatter devices and concluded they're safe: <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/SecuritySystems/ucm227201.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmitt...</a><p>According to the FDA, the dose to the skin is <i>89,000 times lower than the annual limit</i>. If backscatter scanners caused harm, it would tell us something new about physics, biology, or both.<p>Are backscatter scanners an invasion of privacy? Yes. Are they a waste of money? Almost certainly. Do I wish airports got rid of them? Yes. But unless our understanding of physics and/or biology is very wrong, they're not dangerous.",1350673140

4674942,comment,4674281,4674281,2,0,methodover,,,"My day job is web app development, but for the past year or so I've dedicated much of my spare time to making games. Or, more accurately, I've been <i>trying</i> to make games. So far I've just published only one, a mobile game that was not successful and, I have to admit in hindsight, really wasn't very good.<p>When it comes to game development in particular, I've heard it over and over again that 'ideas are worthless.' But it's become obvious to me that the exact opposite is true: ideas are <i>everything.</i> What I've been struggling to do in this past year is idea-forging, basically. I've been desperately clawing my way towards an elegant game idea which is both (1) fun/unique/interesting and (2) small enough in scope that I can create it in my spare time. At many points I've thought I've had such an idea, only to realize that the idea wasn't that great or the scope was much larger than I anticipated after some prototyping.<p>I completely agree with the article when it comes to how difficult it is to evaluate ideas before they've been implemented: Good ideas probably don't often initially look like good ideas. And bad ideas often look incredibly enticing. And I'm pretty sure that truly new ideas almost always look like bad ideas until you've actually seen them in action. (I guess this is part of why we see so many sequels and remakes from established game companies these days. New game ideas are risky, hard to evaluate, and probably expensive to prototype.)",1350672954

4674934,comment,4674270,4674794,5,0,davesims,,,"Great comment. I appreciate the principle you're working towards, and largely agree with it. But I wonder if the analogy with Physics works well as a broad metaphor for ""intelligence."" The gaps between Newtonian, Quantum and Relativity model physics are singular instances of a peculiar, nearly paradoxical set of apparent contradictions that of course have yet to be fully resolved. Each is correct within its own domain, and the full realization of the implications of each requires complete commitment to the rules within the domain to the exclusion of the other models.<p>So the analogy can also turn around and bite you here. If a researcher in Quantum theory were to get hung up on the apparent contradictions between her own research and the implications within one of the other models, she'd risk being distracted and lose the fruitful path of research within her given domain. In this case, a certain level of myopia is helpful.<p>Did Einstein's tremendous resistance to Heisenberg and Bohr impugn his accomplishments in any way? Of course not. I don't think anyone would use that as an example of diminished intelligence on Einstein's part.<p>Your broader point is valid: be open to other viewpoints. But at another level, taking up a position and defending it has its practical advantages, when the position/opinion shows fruitful results.<p>In software, I think of DHH's 'opinionated' approach to Rails and how that has informed and guided the whole Ruby community. For many programmers Rails' implicit, ""magical"" approach to coding is not as good as, for instance Django/Python's more explicit philosophy. Both points of view are valid, but the strengths of each would be diluted if they tried to do both. I also think of the Torvalds/Tanenbaum debate over Kernel architectures. Deciding which is correct is way above my pay grade, but it seems clear to me that Linus had to take up a position here and commit to it in order for Linux to thrive the way it has.<p>I also think of the common criticism of JavaScript's OO structures, that it's a confusing hybrid of Prototypical and Classical OOP, leading to inconsistent or confusing structures. Perhaps a thorough commitment to one or the other would have been better?<p>So, on the one hand a certain openness and teachability is necessary, but then at strategic points in the development of an idea, a certain stubbornness and myopia seems to be equally important to the ultimate execution of a vision.",1350672769

  No. Placing your number on the National Do Not Call Registry will stop most telemarketing calls, but not all. 
  Because of limitations in the jurisdiction of the FTC and FCC, calls from or on behalf of political organizations, 
  charities, and telephone surveyors would still be permitted, as would calls from companies with which you have an
  existing business relationship, or those to whom youve provided express agreement in writing to receive their
  calls. However, if you ask a company with which you have an existing business relationship to place your number on
  its own do-not-call list, it must honor your request.  You should keep a record of the date you make the request.

  Are calls from political organizations or calls soliciting for charities covered?

  Political solicitations are not covered by the TSR at all, since they are not included in its definition of 
  telemarketing. Charities are not covered by the requirements of the national registry. However, if a third-party
  telemarketer is calling on behalf of a charity, a consumer may ask not to receive any more calls from, or on behalf
  of, that specific charity. If a third-party telemarketer calls again on behalf of that charity, the telemarketer
  may be subject to a fine of up to $16,000.</code></pre>",1350671623

The problem comes from the fact that most of the data we've collected is with X-rays that deposit their energy evenly throughout your body's volume. The heuristics based on that data erroneously suggest that skin is one of the least cancer prone tissues. However, we know on the basis of microbiology that this isn't the case.

4674794,comment,4674270,4674270,36,0,Xcelerate,,,"I would argue that this is <i>the</i> defining factor in what makes someone intelligent or not.  If you're always revising your ways of thinking about a problem, your probability of converging on a solution is vastly greater than someone with a narrow, one-track focus.  In fact, another article on the HN homepage (<a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/streams-of-consciousness/2012/10/18/how-do-you-spot-a-genius/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/streams-of-consciousness...</a>) elaborates on this point of trying multiple ""solution paths"" to arrive at an answer to a problem.<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of people get it in their head that they've discovered the ""right way"" and dismiss every other idea.  This problem is particularly notorious in subjects like quantum mechanics.  The field is so confusing that people find some kind of local comprehension maximum that they get stuck in and refuse to budge from that sort of ideology (which is often the <i>wrong</i> ideology by the way since QM is such a deep subject.  Throw some quantum field theory or standard model physics at a quantum chemistry professor or TA and they won't know what to make of it).<p>To give a more concrete example: did you know that a spinning ball weighs more than the same ball when it is stationary?  Tell this to someone decently knowledgable in physics and there's a good chance they'll argue vehemently against you based on their misunderstanding (or misinformation) of what they've learned in the past.  Sometimes the effort to convince someone of an idea like this isn't worth the time; these people are locked into one way of thinking and take it as an affront to their ego.  There's limited intelligence here.  Don't want to be like this?  Don't get angry when someone challenges you.  That's the best way to start.  I've never understood why so many people get upset if you try to point out a flaw in their reasoning.  I've noticed this sort of anger much less frequently on HN (on the other hand, there's significantly more ""you're wrong"" posts than a normal discussion board).<p>In fact, do a little experiment if you wish.  Look through HN stories and find places where people challenge each other in the comments.  If you notice someone who says ""you know what -- you're correct"" or ""yeah, that makes more sense"", there's a good chance they make a lot of intelligent posts on here.  If you find someone that <i>never</i> concedes to anyone else, it's likely they are locked into one and only one way of thinking and are unlikely to ever do anything considered ""genius"".",1350670716

Now it clearly does.  What the author ignores is that brand image is a product of many things, with press releases being only a small part for most companies (They are a somewhat larger part of Apple's brand).  A long track record of high quality and innovative products coupled with clever advertising is what makes or breaks a brand like Apple's more than anything else.<p>Microsoft's brand is currently rather mediocre.  Missteps over the last decade have really hurt it, but Windows 7 did go a long way to help it recover.  Vista, as maligned as it was, was actually a really good OS saddled with some bad default settings (e.g. The overly obtrusive UAC).  Windows 7 brought some minor innovations to the interface, greatly improved the default settings, and added a little bit of ""cool"" with details as subtle as just adding some unusually funky and artistic default backgrounds.  Windows 7's default backgrounds made OSX look like the bland, boring corporate OS that Apple has long tried to brand Windows to be!<p>Movie studios often keep stinkers under strict wraps until opening weekend.

This ""festival route"" builds word of mouth.<p>If MS had kept Windows 8 under wraps until a big press event this month and then hyped it as the most awesome thing ever, just like Apple does with their products, few people would likely believe them.  By broadly distributing a release candidate for Windows 8 and showing the Surface publicly prior to release, MS took the ""festival route"" and built a big word-of-mouth effect.

There is a difference between philosophical differences in political views about subjective or unknown issues and actual bias, where ideological commitments result in irrational positions on subjects with real evidence (roughly: denial of evolution/climate change is most often political bias, differences in taxation policy or social safety net policy are most often philosophical differences)<p>Also, I don't think I'm moderate centre or middle at all, nor am I just left. My worldview is based on science, rationality and skepticism so on the scale you are using I swing from centre to extreme left to fairly right depending on the issue. Perhaps that's why I consider the single axis political spectrum to be a framework for the ignorant and only useful to those writing the talking points. I certainly consider The Economist to be more similar to The Guardian than to the Daily Mail, which probably sounds crazy to you.<p>I understand you could read the different broadsheets to understand how their politics differ but how do you translate that to bias?

However, once I switched to CS (I already had interest in it and had been programming in Python for a year) I found out that the program here sucks.<p>How important is location in the long run? If I moved to the San. Fran Bay area and went to school there, I feel like I would be learning mostly from the community. I would have access to events that don't exist here. To do this though, I would want to go to a decent school in Cali, most likely one of the public uni's. To establish residency I would most likely need to work and go to community college for a year. This would be done after my freshman year, so I would have 1 year of theory based CS knowledge/Java, and 2 years of Python experience if I continue learning on my free time.<p>It would be a pretty rough road to transfer out of state, establish residency, start over, all of that fun stuff. Will the community benefit me enough to make this move worth it?

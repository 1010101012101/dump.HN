That path leads to evil.<p>I also think you're not understanding finance very well. There's no rational reason to insist that financial instruments must be ""directly relating to the demand and supply curve of physical items"". There are plenty of good reasons for such instruments, facilitating risk management [1] and liquidity in the markets.<p>[1] Of course, in this case, the particular instruments did the opposite of risk management. This is because their risk models were flawed. I agree with you regarding the moral hazard created by gov't meddling, making it so that financial institutions don't need to learn lessons about ensuring their risk models are based in better-understood methods, or are at least very conservative.",1300060711

Also google phrases like ""linux user's group"" + cityname, ""ruby user's group"" + cityname, ""java user's group"" + cityname, ""perl mongers"" + cityname, etc., etc.   Once you find a handful of interesting groups to start interacting with, you'll usually find that one group leads you to another (ex, groups cross-posting meeting announcements to one another's mailing lists, or standing up and making an announcement about an upcoming meeting, at the meeting of a related group, etc.)<p>Edit: plancast is another decent place to find out about upcoming events of various sorts.",1300060649

Given a code snippet, my guess for the correct statement ending is a total shot in the dark. Comma, semicolon, period? No idea. I can't imagine I'll ever be able to build something with any real functionality, apart from passing messages from one place to another.<p>I know this is the sort of question that will raise the ire of most aficionados, but is there an ""acceptable Erlang""?

From personal experience, though, those circumstances are more difficult to approach a person you're attracted to (unless they are specifically geared toward meeting people (for relationship purposes) within a specific shared interest).  Nonetheless, if you lack confidence to approach a prospective mate, the setting won't matter much, you simply won't approach someone you're interested in.<p>Personally (as I had written previously), I advocate diving in head first into the ""dating scene"" without prejudging the scene.  You've referred to it as <i>shallow</i> and <i>sex focused</i>.  It doesn't have to be.  Commit to not having sex until you're married, or some other meaningful milestone and approach the dating scene that way.  I didn't find my bride in the shallow, sex focused dating scene, but I would have never approached her if I didn't have the practice that said dating scene gave me.  I believe, in most cases, men have a one-up that the person answering this question failed to take into account.  Most men place a far higher value on physical attributes than women do (though, height is one of those attributes that seems to be very important to the women I've known, so I sympathize with this gentleman ... being skinny and not muscularly developed tends to follow pretty closely, though ... and I'm in that camp).<p>I remember how difficult it was at the time, and how insecure I was, but it got easier and I wouldn't have met my bride if not for the miserable experience of submitting myself to rather consistent rejection.",1300059502

Your scenarios presume that the iPad's mobility will trump the disadvantages of the small screen size to the point it will replace existing solutions with bigger screens. I'm not convinced that's the case. For example, when I visit the doctor or dentist, I don't go to an ""office"", I go to an examining or operating room. You know, places where they like nice big displays so everyone there can see the details of the x-ray pics? Those rooms are already networked and they stay put day after day, so mobility is not a desperate need.<p>Some of your examples seem contrived, like the office meeting where someone is dragging their power brick -- as if the iPad was the only device with a battery that lasts all day (and that the office worker didn't just unplug their laptop at their desk, where it had been freshly charged).<p>Police in their cars don't need a smaller display, and when they're out of the car they don't need yet another thing dangling from their belts.

2320510,comment,2320224,2320224,0,0,zmmmmm,,,"The fact that Google is going out of their way to pour water on this is kind of interesting in itself.   It almost suggests that they have some kind of under-the-covers agreement (I guess it can't be Facebook, but maybe Twitter?) that they're trying hard not to step on?<p>From what I've observed they seem to have firmly adopted a different strategy for social which involves organically growing their existing products with social features rather than trying a high profile (and high risk) product launch.   To me this demonstrated some much needed corporate self-awareness (there are some things Google just isn't good at) and so I was pretty surprised to see that they would have reversed that and gone for a big splash.<p>I honestly think Google has all the seeds to make a competitive social offering but they need to play their cards very carefully and tie things together in the right way.   If they can weave Gmail, Google Talk, YouTube and Picasa together then they basically have Facebook's feature set.  All of these products are best of class and loved individually by their users.   Add Android into the mix and Google even has a trump card they can play.  The question is how Google can gently usher all those users / technologies into one cohesive social offering without harming the individual products, alarming people about privacy or any other negative consequences.  It has to be done carefully and gradually and with sensitivity.  I think this is exactly what they've been doing and is the smart strategy.",1300057932

Here's where you get off track:  Something under 1% of the people with such 'ideas' achieve success.  Or, what fraction of the people can be in the upper 1%?<p>So, the evidence that would be needed would be the role of ideas for that upper 1% or less.<p>As I wrote elsewhere on this thread, what is being assumed here about an 'idea' is just some short description of a 'cutomer need' to be met by, say, a new Web site, say, paper napkins with personalized printing ordered on a Web site and delivered via FedEx.  Then, sure, execution is everything.<p>What is being missed, however, is old, traditional, and rock solid:  Take a problem millions of people want solved, or that a few people want very, very much to have solved, find a solution, and then execute.  Here the implication is that, because the problem has not been solved yet, finding the solution, the 'idea', is challenging.  Then commonly people would protect the idea with a patent.<p>If the idea was really good, then the execution should be routine.  Examples?

2320495,comment,2318939,2319291,0,0,reneherse,,,"Agreed! The utility of a chainsaw is greatly limited by the fact that it can only be safely used by a trained operator. No way I'm going to hand over my (small sized) chainsaw to just any helper at a campsite. In an emergency scenario, it's important to have tools that can be used safely by most anyone, lest your skilled and experienced operator is injured.<p>If you want something with good cutting ability that is safe and self contained (i.e. no generator required) consider the several variants of saws that ""cut on the pull"". The advantage of a pull saw is that the blade is kept in tension during the cutting stroke, and therefor will not buckle no matter how thin its steel. Also, typically the pull stroke of your arm is stronger than your push (back and biceps vs chest and triceps).<p>There are aggressively toothed folding camp saws and non-folding tree trimming saws that would be great additions to a survival kit. As the parent commenter suggests, get a larger one and avoid the frustration of short strokes!<p>My all time favorite kind of pull saw is the Japanese style carpenter's saw. Shaped kind of like a long (unbent) spatula, it's capable of incredible speed and accuracy, well beyond that of a western hand saw in my experience. You can get a decent one at Home Depot or Sears with alternate edges for cutting wood (across the grain) or ripping it (with the grain). I'd recommend one of these for every home repair toolkit, but unless you're going to repel zombies with finely mitered woodwork, get the other kind of saw for your survival kit.",1300057374

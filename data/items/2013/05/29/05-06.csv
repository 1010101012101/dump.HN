5784843,comment,5777719,5783615,1,0,skavander,,,"The point is that a salt would essentially give you a constant speed of cracking versus a speed that scaled with the size of the dataset you have. For example, the guy in the article cracked 10,000-ish passwords in 16 minutes - 600 passwords per minute. If he'd had a dataset of 1.6 million, he would have cracked over a million (assuming the passwords were of the same quality and he has some good way of storing them on his hardware to allow fast lookup), at a rate of 60,000 passwords per minute, all on his single GPU.<p>However, with a salt he'd be limited to about 1 password per every 27 minutes. And this rate would not increase as the dataset grew larger, which means that even if he had 10x the power as you suggest he could only crack about 20 passwords per hour (more or less). Thus to crack even 1% of a 1.6 million password dataset (16,000 passwords) it would take over a month of non-stop computation on 10 GPU's, versus a single GPU computing 62% (again over a million) in 16 minutes.<p>So even if a compromised website took a month to realize the leak, it would be able to inform it's users in time such that 99% of them would be able to change passwords and avoid their accounts being compromised in time. With no salt, no such luck since as we can see here up to 90% of the dataset would be cracked within a day.",1369807130

I admire how you're approaching the problem at HireArt, and am thankful that the current wave of disruption in education should hopefully keep society from feeling the full fallout of the education bubble. It will be interesting to see what the world looks like in 10 years.<p>However, I think the bubble will persist even if all degrees were viewed as equal due to the economics around cheap financing of degrees and disincentives among universities to compete on price and incentives to compete on ancillary concerns like luxury housing, amenities, facilities, and the like. Of course, even without this warped structure of incentives, the university model is one with huge overhead, a rigid and inflexible structure, slow to adapt to change (though they are trying), and not nearly as well positioned to take advantage of economies of scale as the likes of Udacity, Coursera, or even UOP.<p>This entire topic fascinates me, and I don't think we've even begun to unravel all of the causes and implications of what these changes mean for society and the future of education.

(post author, btw)<p>> The problem to me seems to be that the interesting problems always come across the case where updates are not commutative.<p>I agree that many application-level integrity constraints can't be satisfied with commutative updates. However, I've been surprised how frequently they can work for many web applications and how frequently ""fuck-it"" integrity constraint maintenance is employed given i.) faster database operation and 2.) asynchronous compensation mechanisms (e.g., bank overdraw fees) in the event of constraint violation. But your point is well-taken!<p>> Here, client B should fail since client A has not committed.<p>I think I understand your example, though I'm not clear as to whether s and t are stored on both X and Y or separately as s on X and t on Y. But, in general, writes in 'pending' should not block the insertion of other writes into 'pending' (in 2PC parlance, prepared but non-committed transactions should <i>not</i> block other transactions from preparing). This is fundamental to the non-blocking property of the algorithm here (i.e., <a href=""http://www.bailis.org/blog/non-blocking-transactional-atomicity/#so_what_just_happened"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bailis.org/blog/non-blocking-transactional-atomic...</a>). So if client A hasn't committed, it shouldn't stop client B from committing. If client A and client B's writes don't commute, then the clients should use a stronger protocol/isolation level than the effective Read Committed that the NBTA algorithm here provides (doable but requires blocking).

Thanks for the feedback!<p>> I guess one of the key insights is that each data has a canonical server owner which enforces the consistency of the writes of the data at a single place.<p>Well, this is the way I presented it, because it's easiest to understand. But, if you want a replicated system that provides HA, there are alternatives (<a href=""http://www.bailis.org/blog/non-blocking-transactional-atomicity/#ha-note"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bailis.org/blog/non-blocking-transactional-atomic...</a>).<p>> When a third client3 tries to read the latest value of x or y, what is the latest value of its peer data? It looks like depending which data client3 starts with, it would get a different version of the peer data? ... Am I missing something or this is the semantic in determining the latest values of peer data?<p>Good question! This ultimately comes down to how you want to handle concurrent writes. Many distributed databases use a ""last writer wins"" strategy when reconciling concurrent updates (that is, the correct behavior is specified to be that the database serves the highest-timestamped version of a given data item). Now, in your example, the clients both started their writes at the same (real-world) time and used this time as a basis for their timestamp, so the ""last"" write is undefined. We need a way to break the ""last writer wins"" tie. In practice, this can be something like the client ID appended to the last few bits of the timestamp or even a hash of the value written--as long as the tie-breaker is deterministic (that is, different replicas don't decide different ""winners""), it doesn't really matter which is chosen.<p>In practice, to avoid storing every value ever written, you'd want to provide some kind of ""merge"" function for multiple writes, and, in our implementation and in often practice, this is last writer wins (plus some deterministic tie-breaker for identically timestamped but distinct writes).",1369805623

5784751,comment,5783945,5783945,112,0,anonymous592053,,,"> This week marks the beginning of my 4th year at Facebook. My\n> experience here has been incredibly transformative: I joined\n> Facebook after dropping out of college having never faced the\n> challenges that I've seen during my time here. At this point, I've\n> worked through these challenges for longer than 4/5 of the people at\n> the company and thought I would share some of my insights in hopes\n> that other engineers who are joining might find it useful.<p>This marks the beginning of my 17th week of unemployment* after being\nfired from Facebook after about a half a year working there. My\nexperience being fired has been incredibly transformative. I worked\nthrough challenges for longer than 1/10 of the people at the company\nand thought I'd write this alternative viewpoint in hopes that other\nengineers who might want to join Facebook find it useful.<p>In what follows, I will attempt to only share true stories without any\ninterjection of my own opinion. Though, being fired -- after being\nenticed with a high salary, accepting a large bonus to move to Silicon\nValley, and taking out a lease that you can't afford without a high\npaying job -- does cause a fair bit of emotional dismay.<p>As a little backstory, I was asked to interview for Facebook by one of\ntheir recruiters. I was already employed, but thought it was time to\ngrow professionally. I interviewed with Facebook, and did very well,\nand was quickly offered a cool salary. Less than a week after\nrelocating interstate to my new home, I started work. After doldrums\nand threats, which I will discuss briefly below, I was let go, without\nnotice, stuck with a six-month lease in location with a hyper-inflated\nreal estate economy.<p>> As an engineer, your job is to build things that solve\n> problems. When you first join the company, you're assigned small\n> tasks and you solve them.<p>As an employee, your job is to make the company money.<p>You are given a variety of disparate tasks to solve, with the\nultimate goal that after six weeks, you find the area and team you\nwant to join.<p>But don't get me wrong, you actually are pushed in the direction\nFacebook would prefer you to go. There are high priority teams and low\npriority teams. Unless you have a good reason, you better choose a\nhigh pri team.<p>> As you grow professionally, the domain of these tasks becomes\n> larger. It is a mistake to constrain the increase in domain to\n> larger or more frequent diffs. Code is a tool you have for solving\n> problems.<p>Weird. Aside from being juggled around as an employee, being given\nwork on front-end, back-end, low-level, and high-level tasks, I was\nlectured on Facebook's rules of the road: Generate lots of diffs! Bang\nout code fast! But make sure it's right first time! As I'll discuss\nnext, you also should minimize your interactions with engineers during\nthe code review process. Facebook actually prefers to treat it as a\n""Code Acceptance (otherwise you're failing)"" process.<p>> If you were gardening, you might plant flowers or pull\n> weeds. Increasing your scope does not mean planting more flowers or\n> pulling more weeds (though you should expect to be faster and more\n> proficient at that as you become more experienced). What it really\n> means is looking up from the ground at the garden in its entirety,\n> considering how your section fits in, and eventually helping to\n> decide the whole garden's plan.<p>A nice idea.<p>The way my manager personally handled personal growth of his\nsubordinates is by threatening them. Well, me, at least. If I didn't\ncomplete some odd tasks he assigned me by a certain date, I'd be sure\nnot to have a place at Facebook after that date. This occurred on more\nthan one occasion.<p>Despite meeting these demands, it was fruitless, and I was told during\na meeting that my bags were packed and waiting for me in the lobby,\nand to hand over my badge and laptop immediately.<p>> In order to do this effectively you need to have agency. Agency is\n> the capacity for a person to act in the world. As a hacker, having\n> agency over your world is critical to fully explore the boundaries\n> of problems and find how to best leverage your solutions. I'm\n> referring both to the code that you write and to the interactions\n> you have within the company.<p>I was given these sorts of platitudes often.<p>I loved exploring code. But I was told to just hone in on the issue I\nwas supposed to solve, not worry about the bigger picture, and to just\nsolve the problem. In theory, the above sounds nice, but in practice,\nI was told the opposite.<p>Regarding interactions with other people in the company: I was\nultimately told by my manager that I should reduce interactions with\nother developers, and eventually, I was told I was not allowed to\nspeak to other developers at all, apparently to ""gauge my\nperformance."" After several weeks of complying with this rule, the\nrelationships I developed thus far in the company weakened and\nessentially evaporated.",1369805062

Its only saving graces are the wonderful narration (done by this exciting British guy named Danny Wallace), and the excellent use of color. If you don't enjoy the first 15 minutes, your experience probably won't improve in the many hours to come (on a side note, I feel the game is about 1.5x as long as it should be. there was a lot of ""sheesh -- when will this set of levels end?"" in my playthrough). You're better off just listening to all the narration (which is great, and really adds a lot of pathos to moving rectangles around a screen).<p>I should emphasize that I don't think Thomas Was Alone is a <i>bad game.</i> It tries to do a lot of things (probably too many) at once and does many of them right. The ones it flubs up, though, cause the game to be tedious and unfocused and frustrating in enough places that, for me, it ceases to be fun to play. Give it a try -- you may enjoy it! I didn't.<p>(Sorry if my complaints here are vague. There's a lot I want to say because I just finished playing, but it's late, and I'm trying to keep this to a ""should I play it?"" kind of blurb.

There are all sorts of power, and all sorts of ways one can hold another in power.  There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the relationship between me and my local police officer.  He is in a position of power, in that I've agreed to follow his directions in most cases, and it's a mutually beneficial relationship.  There's also nothing wrong with the relationship between me and my Congressman.  He's in a position of a power in that he creates (with others) the law of the land, and I am in a different position of power in that I vote him in or out.  I can go on and on, as the world is full of complex relationships, but with respect to the subject at hand, you seem to be arguing that someone is wrong for considering a person worthy of giving advice, and putting that person in a ""position of power"" by allowing them to speak that advice.

A few observations from the article:<p>> <i>our bodies are designed for scarcity</i><p>This is something that&#x27;s been forgotten in many countries where life is now comfortable all the time. Skipping one meal is not the terrible thing that most people imagine it is.<p>> <i>the Terrible, Insufferable Six-Day Water Fast</i><p>The first few days are difficult. After day 3 or so, hunger disappears.<p>> <i>vicious headaches, dizziness, and a sad, hollow feeling</i><p>These are surprisingly similar to an addiction withdrawal process.<p>> <i>On my final day without food, I wake up at 5 A.M. I slept in! And all of a sudden, I feel tremendous. Light, energetic, unreasonably cheerful.</i><p>Exactly.<p>So, the first 3 days or so are tough. After that, hunger disappears. You get a sense of amazing energy, powerful but calm. Your body is relaxed all the time. There&#x27;s an amazing mental clarity. You do everything consciously and purposefully. Negative thoughts are gone or greatly diminished.<p>I can definitely see why fasting was used in most if not all traditions where meditation and prayer were practiced.<p>BTW, the longer the fast, the trickier the coming out of it. Restarting suddenly on a high-calorie solid food diet may cause problems.",1383764395

Forget how the vendors obtain the drugs for a second and just analyze the differences in distribution and consumption between offline and online drug trade.<p>Offline there is:
 - competition via violence
 - political narcoterrorism
 - profit maximization by product dilution
 - profit maximization by product deception (most street MDMA is amphetamine+nBOME mixture)<p>Online there is:
 - competition via quality, price (violence impossible in anonymous marketplace)
 - political separation via anonymity
 - drastically reduced product dilution (people do reviews with sources like ecstasydata.org)
 - drastically reduced product deception (see &quot;The LSD Avengers&quot; for example)<p>When you contrast these aspects you see that the online marketplaces do operate like a free market with the biggest difference being the incentives associated with deceptive vending.  I think thats valuable just because it provides a real world simulation for what variables of legalization would look like without forcing any one country to take the initial plunge by themselves.",1383764285

More importantly, however, I think it misses a more fundamental mistake that startups make: they don&#x27;t know how to choose a lawyer.<p>If you&#x27;re working with a firm that has summer associates (referred to as &quot;law students&quot; in the post), and they are being billed out at $200/hour, you are almost certainly working with a large, full-service law firm. And large, full-service law firms are expensive.<p>Working with a large, full-service law firm is overkill for the vast majority of early-stage startups.

IIRC, he would travel for a few hours (by bus) to a town and deposit his packages in a mailbox there [citation needed]. This made it difficult to track him, since the origin of the package didn&#x27;t leak any information about the sender.<p>For sellers, proper OPSec requires that they do not leave fingerprints in/on the package, that mailing locations are reasonably random and not isolated to a small geographic area, and that the sender masks his identity (veiled face, no cellphone, no car) when dropping off the packages. Additionally, a seller should use a variety of packaging types for shipments to make detecting the illicit shipments harder.<p>Given these precautions, it would likely be infeasible for law enforcement agencies to identify a given seller.

Getting the drives and raid controllers to obey that has historically been a difficult, ongoing job that has to be redone with each new generation of hardware. SSDs have been particularly interesting with that,  the actual flush to disk can be quite delayed from the logical write. Some have supercaps, some don&#x27;t. Those that don&#x27;t are vulnerable to power losses while the data is still in the drive&#x27;s ram awaiting a block erase and write.  The IDE drivers used to flat out lie. Enterprise SAS drives often come with the write caching turned on (since it looks better in benchmarks) even though they&#x27;re often times used behind a battery backed raid controller.<p>Adding a VM layer to that just to get snapshots seems overly complicated and prone to issues.",1383763842

Ben Franklin explained it quite well:<p>-----------------------<p>The Remissness of our People in Paying Taxes is highly blameable; the Unwillingness to pay them is still more so. I see, in some Resolutions of Town Meetings, a Remonstrance against giving Congress a Power to take, as they call it, the People&#x27;s Money out of their Pockets, tho&#x27; only to pay the Interest and Principal of Debts duly contracted. They seem to mistake the Point. Money, justly due from the People, is their Creditors&#x27; Money, and no longer the Money of the People, who, if they withold it, should be compell&#x27;d to pay by some Law.<p>All Property, indeed, except the Savage&#x27;s temporary Cabin, his Bow, his Matchcoat, and other little Acquisitions, absolutely necessary for his Subsistence, seems to me to be the Creature of public Convention. Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it. All the Property that is necessary to a Man, for the Conservation of the Individual and the Propagation of the Species, is his natural Right, which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition. He that does not like civil Society on these Terms, let him retire and live among Savages. He can have no right to the benefits of Society, who will not pay his Club towards the Support of it.<p>-----------------------<p>Source: <a href=""http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch16s12.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch16s12....</a>",1383763371

Here&#x27;s the largest and most verbose &#x27;detail&#x27;:<p>>One morning back in 2011, I woke to searing pain in my arms. A flamethrower directed at my arms is what it felt like. The hospital offered morphine, but one shot did nothing. A second and then a third shot only made me sob more quietly. Finally Dilaudid, at ten times morphine&#x27;s strength, cooled off the pain. Several doctors and hospitals later, I was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease in which the nerves that branch from the neck and power the arms are bulldozed by the immune system. There&#x27;s no cure, just a blitz of medicines to blanket the suffering. So I embarked on a grisly medical protocol: monster doses of steroids, antiseizure agents for nerve pain, and a lot of craft beer, ice cream, and chocolate for the larger problem of what it now felt like to be me.",1383763279

A piano note is a complicated stack of overtones (some of which are harmonic and some of which aren&#x27;t) and transients. If it was just a sine wave, it would <i>sound</i> like a sine wave and not like a piano.<p>This is part of why things like Shazam are so difficult: musical notes aren&#x27;t just a single frequency in the FFT, they are a stack of them.<p>> You could just tell them a handful of numbersthe sizes of the different circles in the picture above.<p>This is actually the exact same number of numbers as in the time-domain series. Taking the FFT on its own doesn&#x27;t reduce the amount of data, it&#x27;s about discarding or compressing some of the frequencies after you do.<p>> The really high notes arent so important (our ears can barely hear them), so MP3s throw them out, resulting in added data compression.<p>This is only part of what MP3&#x27;s do, and at high bitrates this really is inaudible. The main source of compression is that the precision of the numbers used to represent the amplitude of the sine waves is reduced.<p>When you have a loud sound and a quiet sound at the same time, the loud sound will &quot;drown out&quot; the quiet one (called &quot;auditory masking&quot;). You won&#x27;t be able to hear the quiet one, or one be able to hear it precisely. MP3 and other audio codecs take advantage of that by encoding quieter frequencies with less fidelity when there are other louder frequencies at the same time. You don&#x27;t notice the loss of precision since it&#x27;s buried under louder sounds.<p>> Just as MP3s throw out the really high notes, JPEGs throw out the really tiny circles.<p>This is off too. If JPEG <i>discarded</i> high-frequency signals, you would just be blurring the entire image. It would be <i>exactly</i> like saving it scaled down and then scaling it back up with some smooth interpolation.<p>Obviously, JPEGs don&#x27;t appear to be stretched out thumbnails, so that isn&#x27;t what happens. Instead, it&#x27;s not that high-frequency signals are <i>discarded</i>, it&#x27;s that their <i>precision</i> is reduced.<p>Human eyes are quite good at detecting sharp edges and fine details. What they aren&#x27;t good at is detecting <i>how sharp</i> an edge is. We can definitely see a break between two colors, but we can&#x27;t accurately detect the <i>magnitude</i> of that the difference.<p>JPEG takes advantage of that by rounding off those high-frequency variances to nearby values. That means there are fewer possible values at high frequencies, so fewer bits are needed to encode them.<p>I realize I&#x27;m being a negative Nancy here. I really liked your post and I agree 100% on how awesome the Fourier transform is. It&#x27;s also quite hard to describe it in an approachable way, and you&#x27;ve done an admirable job.

6684441,comment,6683761,6684189,11,0,jarrett,,,"> considering that the sellers might be cops<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t law enforcement pose as buyers, as well? This is a common tactic in narcotics enforcement. Entrapment often isn&#x27;t an issue, as the seller took the first step of advertising the drugs for sale.<p>Are you getting at the fact that the buyer must have a receiving address, while the seller can ship anonymously? I would be skeptical of that. If I were attempting to track the source of a package, and I had the full force of warrants behind me, I bet I could track down most shippers.<p>Every shipping company has its own tracking information. Much of this may be opaque to the end user. The tracking might be much more detailed than what you can see as an end user with a tracking number. Assuming the carrier cooperates with law enforcement, tracking could (presumably) be further enhanced for targeted post offices, routes, etc..<p>For example, suppose I, as a law enforcement agent, receive an order from a Silk Road seller. Let&#x27;s say it was shipped in an envelope, dropped off at a USPS street-corner box. From the tracking info, I identify which post office first handled the envelope. Thus I narrow my search to a few possible mailboxes served by that post office.<p>I instruct the carriers at that post office to assist me. As they follow their routes, emptying mailboxes, I have them sort outgoing mail into separate bags, one per box. I have the post office flag any mail going to my address.<p>I place another order from the same seller. When it hits the post office, it gets flagged, and because of the per-box sorting, I know which mailbox was used.<p>For round three, I place yet another order, this time with the mailbox under surveillance. I also install a camera inside the mailbox that sees the destination address of every envelope deposited. When the seller drops his shipment, my surveillance team detects it. They then follow the person who dropped the letter. Now I have the shipper&#x27;s identity.<p>Can these measures be defeated with appropriate opsec? Maybe, if you know exactly what tactics law enforcement will employ. But you don&#x27;t. You could spend all your time defending against the tactics I just described, only to get caught because law enforcement came up with a totally different strategy.<p>My point is, opsec is really, really hard.",1383762931

At least speaking as an American, we don&#x27;t seem to have any.  I watched a neighboring state&#x27;s election last night and the result was very close.  Very close.  Out of over 2 million votes, the opponents were separated by less than 60,000 votes in the outcome.<p>Of the two primary candidates, the winner was a notoriously corrupt politician who is well-known for being a political fund-raiser and (basically) morally bankrupt, while the other is more intellectually honest (at least, as comparing his statements to his voting record), but openly disapproves of things like gay marriage, and wanted to ban blowjobs.  Even the libertarian candidate (and I&#x27;m a libertarian party member) was sleazy in too many ways.<p>Ultimately, the contest was won (predictably) by the one who spent the most money.  Which means that fund-raising was critical, which means that getting in bed with money is necessary, which makes it nearly impossible to get intellectual honesty in elections.  There are pretty noble efforts to eliminate, make transparent, or in some way normalize election contributions, but that just shrinks the list of viable candidates down to the rich, which isn&#x27;t meant as an indictment of the rich, but isn&#x27;t necessarily good for the interests of the hoi polloi either.

Just like terminals you&#x27;ll be able to embed it into your own site/app and open/host X11 applications (e.g. LibreOffice, RDP/VNC clients, web browsers, etc etc).<p>Right now Gate One (and its Terminal app) are open source (AGPLv3) with a commercial license available.  It&#x27;s not making much money with that business model--despite hundreds of thousands of devices shipped with Gate One and several SaaS platforms using it.  So I&#x27;ve come to HN to ask for advice:  How should I license the X11 app?<p>Something like a free trial with reminders that you need to pay (like Sublime Text 2)?  If I do that how much should I charge?  How do I differentiate the pricing for businesses that just want to show off their application on their website from businesses that want to use it as a replacement for Citrix?<p>I have my own ideas for all these things but I want to see what the HN community thinks.",1383762571

- Weight
- Size
- Battery life<p>Any modular design impacts all 3 of these things. And there are a lot more downsides to it than just that.<p>To be really modular, you would need some sort of &#x27;interconnect&#x27; bus, to tell the &#x27;main cpu&#x27; of the phone exactly what modules are installed. This means that EACH module needs a chip that handles communication on this centralized bus. One of the reasons cellphones become smaller, thinner and have a longer battery life is due to the integration of all those little chips into just a few. Each chip requires a minimum of power to run, and if you have some sort of intelligent on-chip power management you can easily shut down parts that you don&#x27;t need. Sure, some clever scheme to power down individual modules based on use can be engineered, but this would still be far from efficient.<p>Also - this &#x27;central bus&#x27; will be limited to today&#x27;s technology. Will it still be sufficient for next-gen hardware? What if in a few years, &#x27;integrated&#x27; phones have full 4k-resolution recording? Will the this bus still have sufficient bandwidth? Current phone development is moving FAST. Why? No necessary constraints and reliance on aged technology, they can develop and adapt things as much as they want. Better placement of the microphones? Flash further away from the lens gives better results? Sensors integrated in the display? Front camera upgrade? That are things that are going to be ver tricky in a modular phone.<p>Modularity will also require more logic to be separated. Good example are camera&#x27;s, most of the &#x27;heavy lifting&#x27; is done on the main CPU&#x27;s silicon somewhere. To have a &#x27;better&#x27; camera, it&#x27;s not sufficient to just replace the sensor and be done with it. You need an extra chip on the camera module, draining more power, wasting more space, unless you want to make serious trade offs regarding speed, battery life, ... The trend is &#x27;all in one&#x27; for a reason.<p>Also the &#x27;recycling&#x27; argument is bullshit. Normal people will just throw away old &#x27;blocks&#x27; in the normal garbage can without much thought.<p>And then you have the software mess. This is going to be great! Now instead of Android apps having an already immensely fragmented target platform, you just increased that exponentially. Minimum requirements for this game? Well 2gb of ram, this GPU, this CPU, ... Oh and you need at least this module for sensor Y. Oh and if you happen to have module M, you should remove this before running this app, there are compatibility issues with the current driver your system downloaded automagically (I hope).<p>Every modular concept has trade offs, in some cases them being perfectly acceptable, see expansion cards in normal desktop pc&#x27;s - where size isn&#x27;t a problem. A modular phone on the other hand has to make trade-offs in areas that are simply not acceptable.",1383762294

A third party tracking cookie can then make it clear to that third party that the same user is visiting sites A, B, and C over Tor.

That&#x27;ll get you a base backup similar to the slave.<p>What I&#x27;m doing is this:<p>I&#x27;ve got a primary/hot spare pair, and a tertiary db on lesser equipment that&#x27;s my second copy for cases where I have one of the main machines down or I have to rebuild the secondary from the primary.<p>The tertiary db ships logs to s3, after gpging them. Every $timeframe, I take a base backup and throw it up as well. I keep a couple, and delete the older ones. Every few months, I test a restore on ec2.  There&#x27;s a balance between the WAL logs that you need to keep, the time to restore, and the frequency of base backups.<p>[edit - parameter names. Further edit - strategy.]",1383760953

The database may be mid-transaction at that point, but it&#x27;s still better if it does log replay at startup, than losing all the data.<p>Also if your filesystem snapshots can be exposed as files / block devs, you can rsync them to another host lowering the amount of transferred data (keep the previous copy so rsync will only copy the blocks that differ).",1383760901

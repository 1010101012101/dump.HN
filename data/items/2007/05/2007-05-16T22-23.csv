Can anyone name another angel or VC firm that is more transparent than YC, or contributes more to the web startup world? <p>It seems like a number of people on here were staking the entire existence of their startup on YC funding - that's not an entrepreneurial attitude. If you have something worthwhile you'll build and launch it with or without YC. <p>Don't change a thing, Paul.",1179354831

The ideal language in which to express something kind of depends on what you are trying to express, doesn't it? ( maybe  unless you are some kind of meta lisper ( or perl6'er :) ) dreaming of a language that's a strict superset of all possible others )

Once Google made that a slogan, Google was mentioned all the time in such threads for the slogan, and not just because they are a search engine.<p>Google's name still comes up when any evil corporate behavior is discussed in any nerd community (not so much non-nerd groups) because of that great catch phrase, especially when Microsoft is mentioned.  I've always believed, as it sounds from your post, that the phrase has no philosophical or religious meaning beyond ""enough is enough"".  If they teach otherwise in business school, they're making things up.",1179352955

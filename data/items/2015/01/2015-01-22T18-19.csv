Essentially the entire &quot;What Can We Do About It&quot; section reads like it was written for an entirely different purpose than the rest of the post. It is fine to promote those ideas but to tie the idea of increasing civility in communications as an idea of countering systematic biases against certain demographics is a faulty alignment of ideals.<p>Saying read a wiki on feminism as a way to reduce personal attacks in email threads is bizarre.

Any such regime will be structured with <i>incumbent</i> use cases in mind. What if a new VPN-like protocol emerges that can be used to ensure more privacy (e.g. TOR).

Basically the internet rich get richer because they have access to technology that a family subscribing to mid-tier do not.<p>The other problem is that ISPs are not interested in the cutting edge of the internet.

This is the statement with which I disagree. There are many situations where drivers don&#x27;t face penalties if they hit and injure/kill a pedestrian, not just one. Anyway, my views on this are clear and I am obviously in the minority. Regardless, I still think that if one operates a heavy, dangerous vehicle near people who may be killed by it the onus of responsibility for not killing people falls on the driver.<p>If a person leaps in front of a big rig in order to kill themselves, then no, the driver is not responsible. If a kid runs after a soccer ball in the street and gets run over because they driver didn&#x27;t stop in time, then the driver was probably going too fast for the circumstances.<p>Mind you, I like cars. I may walk to work but I drive very quickly on the autobahn a few times a year and it&#x27;s a blast.

Before I go further, let&#x27;s clarify that I am not defending Comcast, and that Net Neutrality is not the &quot;Fuck Comcast&quot; law.  My old AT&T account that PG&E, oddly, sold me when I moved to Oakland was only 1.5mbit, and it was enough for Netflix, but you could expect Netflix to perform as it performs with 1.5mbit of bandwidth.<p>Certainly, I agree that on a lower-cost plan, services that may be hungry for bandwidth should not be allowed to be blocked, that&#x27;s silly, and while noone has really ever substantially done anything like this, I agree that there is a very real risk of business interests being presented with such an opportunity.<p>What this humor kind of fails to address is the fact that, some people will use more internet, maybe a house with 5 roommates needs more internet than an individual - this is actually a way that tiered power billing hurts poorer folks, because 1 rich person gets the same alottment as ten poor people at one address, so using even 5 times as much power costs, oh, ten or twenty times as much.  The law that forces power costs to be tiered is good, and it is motivated by the right reasons, but the way it is implemented puts no pressure on the actual people who waste the most power.<p>I think a more interesting argument would be to say, the free plan has facebook, and facebook subsidizes your internet (something AT&T is already doing with ads), and the median plan has twitter, and you can only use VPN to connect to your office on the highest plan, even if you use almost no bandwidth.<p>If we&#x27;re going to have a conversation, let&#x27;s talk about something of substance.",1421950886

There are some jobs which are not profitable and need supplementary funding to be done.<p>But in our modern capitalist system, if you&#x27;re working for someone, you have a job because more value can be extracted from the work you do than what you&#x27;re paid. The same holds true if the business you work for is being subsidized by the government. Your employer is still skimming off a profit from the subsidy.<p>The worker and employer should decide what fair wage is, but this means that they should have an equal ground to negotiate on. Large groups of organized well-funded and well-lawyered people are setting the compensation rules for an unorganized and financially desperate pool of labor.
Negotiations for fair pay cannot happen in those circumstances. Labor has all the cards stacked against them.
Laws that limit the ability of or outright ban organized labor need to be repealed to that end.<p>Voting with your wallet might have a small effect, but that requires consumers to be well versed in how each business runs and compensates their workers. When the trend is that the majority of workers and yourself have been consistently given the shaft for decades, it is difficult to enact change solely through educated consumption.",1421950320

Also it helps to remember that stress (much of it based on fear) shorten the said lifespan tremendously.

I was lucky enough to get a lot of researchy, green field projects early in my career.  But I grew a lot as a developer when I started maintaining, adapting, and modifying an existing code base.  My only real caveat here is that it should be a relevant project, ideally an open source project.  You&#x27;ll be introduced to a lot of different developers, and you&#x27;ll get a really good sense of how to work collaboratively with a lot of different people.  There is a huge difference between a project that says &quot;there&#x27;s an existing open source app - it&#x27;s reasonably well written, but it needs work and updating, and we need some new features&quot; and &quot;here&#x27;s stan&#x27;s old pile of crap, keep it running.&quot;  The first can be a huge learning experience and great for building a network and career.  This is the sort of experience that gets you to a point where you may be able to get new programming jobs without 3 references and several hours at the whiteboard showing how to find a cycle in a linked list.  A lot of people know you because they have worked with you, and they know your code because, well, they&#x27;ve reviewed your code and you&#x27;ve reviewed theirs.  It really is a way to rise above some of the unpleasantness of our industry.<p>Now for my disagreement.  &quot;Do this job because you love it.&quot;  I&#x27;d be ok if we added the phrase &quot;as the thing you do for money.&quot;  I don&#x27;t think you need to love programming so much that you&#x27;d do it even if you suddenly had 10 mil in your bank account.

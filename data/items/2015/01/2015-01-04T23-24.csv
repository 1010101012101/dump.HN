We serve an audience of more than 1 million unique visitors per year despite having a tiny budget. We are a team of four full-time staff, but as the founder I am also the sole web developer for all of our websites. I&#x27;d like to find someone we can work with periodically on a project-by-project basis, and have some small, quick, easy projects to start. These are mainly things I could do myself given the time to focus on them, but that inevitably haven&#x27;t gotten done.<p>Because we are a not-for-profit, we don&#x27;t have a lot of money so cost unfortunately will be a factor in who we can work with and how much work we can afford to commission at a given time. The ideal for me would be to find someone great who we can return to again and again. My task list for a programmer is endless if we can find the money and the right partner.<p>Please email me directly with any questions!

Yet almost everything is built with a tool that&#x27;s merely good enough for the task. Which usually makes it one of the right tools.<p>You mention that &quot;software development is hard&quot; and even manage to talk about advancing the STEM field, but we&#x27;re talking about handling some http requests and someone&#x27;s weekend project that managed to register a domain name.<p>What is the right tool anyways? PHP as a CGI? Haskell? Does it matter?<p>Bottom line is that you&#x27;re getting wound up by a project that has 9 commits. The last one was 2 months ago.

So I&#x27;ve read it all. Have you?<p>I don&#x27;t think my points are factually incorrect. Please name me one hidden service where (a) the operators are actually anonymous and (b) the man on the street might have actually heard about it and (c) what&#x27;s going on there is not either illegal or unethical. I claim there are none: all the hidden services that have had mainstream coverage are illegal.<p>The blog post is the same as always: the Tor people never give <i>specific</i> examples of hidden services that are beneficial and always talk in generalities, because there are so few convincing good examples. Indeed it says the opposite - they want to boost usage.<p>Other than not linking to the material they&#x27;re discussing, they also didn&#x27;t mention the key finding that is causing such a ruckus: over 80% of all hidden service lookups are to child abuse sites.<p>They say this might be due to law enforcement crawlers, although there is no evidence of this and it leads to the question of why other illegal sites like black markets aren&#x27;t being crawled just as aggressively.<p>There is a train of thought, like AlyssaRowan&#x27;s post above, that says Tor cannot change anything because otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be Tor any more. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s correct. A peer to peer network is ultimately just a group of people working together for a shared goal. That community of people can define the rules for the services they provide, for example Tor tries by default to block torrenting because they collectively decided that they prefer not to spend their resources on that.<p>Bitcoin is another example of an opinionated P2P network. It enforces rather unorthodox rules about inflation and money creation, rules that alt coins often change. Regardless the people taking part in the Bitcoin network specifically have these opinions about the way to manage the monetary base and other people who try to deviate from those rules are effectively kicked out/ignored.<p>Tor and its community <i>could</i> become opinionated about the use of hidden services. They could say hidden services are intended for political communication and organisation, for example (along with whatever other useful things they think of), but not for child abuse. There is nothing technically stopping them, as the CCC talk pointed out. But they have collectively decided not to.",1420415720
8836429,comment,8835085,8835980,0,0,GuiA,,,"Speaking for the ones I have on my shelves:<p>---<p>The AI Game Programming Wisdom and Game Programming Gems are not revision of the same things. They&#x27;re just part of the same series; the format of the books is more akin to a collection of articles (all by different authors from the industry), grouped by topic. For example in volume 1, you have:<p>- General Wisdom (4 articles)<p>- Useful Techniques and Specialized Systems (8)<p>- Pathfinding with A* (5)<p>- Pathfinding and Movement (6)<p>- Tactical Issues and Intelligent Group Movement (6)<p>- General Purpose Architectures (6)<p>- Decision Making Architectures (5)<p>- FPS, RTS, and RPG AI (6)<p>- Racing and Sports AI (8)<p>- Scripting (7)<p>- Learning (10)<p>(the groupings are different for each books)<p>I quite recommend these books - the quality of the articles can be uneven, but you almost always learn something. The main critics against them are that 1) the material can be dated (these books are from the early 2000s) and 2) some of the content can be found online for free. They&#x27;re still good resources to have on your shelves IMO.<p>In the same vein, I recommend the GPU Gems and Graphics Gems for realtime graphics programming.<p>---<p>&quot;Programming Game AI by Example&quot; by Buckland is a great, hands on, practical approach to game programming. It is not academic or theoretical by any means, but that&#x27;s one of its strong traits - it&#x27;s code driven. It was my first AI read while in high school, and I really recommend it. The perfect audience for that would be a motivated teenager or undergrad who knows enough programming to make small games, but hasn&#x27;t taken full AI courses yet.<p>---<p>&quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot; by Norvig et al. is kind of the CLRS of AI - a thorough, deep introduction to the field that will give you all the tools you need to solve pretty much any problem you can encounter. It can be a bit dry/academic at times, but that&#x27;s the price you have to pay. It&#x27;s great to learn from it as part of a focused course while you&#x27;re still getting familiar with the field, and it&#x27;s also great to flip to a random chapter every once in a while to revisit the basics when you&#x27;re a more mature professional.<p>---<p>&quot;Designing Sociable Robots&quot; by Breazal is a cool read - it&#x27;s a collection of 13 fairly independent chapters by the author which mash together HCI, social sciences, robotics, electronics, programming, and each explain how a subcomponent of a full &quot;sociable&quot; robot (in this case her lab&#x27;s project, Kismet) works (e.g. the vision system, an expressive vocalization system, etc.).<p>---<p>&quot;Society of Mind&quot; by Minsky is a very interesting read. It&#x27;s more high level and philosophical, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. It&#x27;s almost 30 years old though, and I&#x27;m not sure how much his work has held up to modern theories - I don&#x27;t follow that field too closely.<p>---<p>&quot;Behavioral Mathematics for Game AI&quot; by Mark is not that code heavy compared to the others (especially the Game AI Wisdom series), although it does have some, and is rather more oriented towards mathematical modeling. It touches on game theory, utility functions, probability distributions, etc. I think it&#x27;s the most mathy an AI text can be before becoming pretty much pure math, which is great- it&#x27;s a great stepping stone for the folks who are programmers first and who want to know more of the math theory behind it all (whether just for understanding or to be able to build their own algorithms).",1420415688

However, the thing to keep in mind is that for free they usually limit features (I think bitbucket limits the number of developers) or remove features all together (google code removing downloads support, github did at one time but reintroduced it). I&#x27;m not saying that I think they should be offering everything for free and shouldn&#x27;t take away features - they have to make money - but in my opinion always have backups and a plan B in case you need to jump ship.<p>I was a huge google code fan (the design isn&#x27;t Web 2.0 with social integrations - but I prefer functional over design) until they pulled the plug on downloads support (which for most Linux people isn&#x27;t a big problem - a make && make install and it&#x27;s compiled AND installed - for Windows it&#x27;s not that easy). Which forced me to self host - I do mirror many of my public projects on github but in the event github management decides to remove/reduce a feature I won&#x27;t be struggling to find a new &quot;home&quot; for my ~100+ projects.<p>Also - if you look at the issue tracker for google code it&#x27;s pretty obvious that Google is no longer supporting or even monitoring it (several spam issues have been appearing). I don&#x27;t have a crystal ball - but my best guess is that Google will pull the plug on Google Code as well.

They work really well in the lab, and mildly well in the real world.  Getting rid of Wifi and replacing it with something else could make unlicensed wireless networking more reliable.  LTE-U seems like the way forward here, though it seems there are some industry barriers in the way.  (If you make LTE chips and sell them all to cell phone carriers, and they tell you they don&#x27;t like LTE-U, you probably won&#x27;t be in a hurry to start selling LTE-U chipsets.  Pure speculation.)<p>That said, 5GHz Wifi does pretty well.  There is a misconception that 5GHz doesn&#x27;t go through walls, but that really has no scientific basis (2.4GHz and 5GHz radio signals are pretty much the same; 60GHz doesn&#x27;t go through walls, but that&#x27;s an order of magnitude higher frequency).  The problem with 5GHz Wifi is that only some channels allow 2.4GHz-equivalent power levels, and access points are really dumb about auto-selecting them.  So if you think 5GHz doesn&#x27;t go through walls, try changing to a high-power channel.  149 is a good one to try, as it&#x27;s high-power and has adjacent channels to steal for 80MHz 802.11ac.

Take it for what its worth:<p>Fed has created abnormal market conditions by printing money and keeping interest rates low. Investors are looking for growth anywhere they can find it and tech companies are good targets - at these values, however, all tech stocks are expensive - even looking at 5+ years of revenue growth down the road. This means that most value-driven investors have left the market and the remaining 5-10%+ increase in market value will be driven by momentum investors. At some point there won&#x27;t be any momentum investors left buying at higher prices, and the market begins to tumble. May be 10-20% correction or something more significant, especially in tech stocks. Facebook has continued to perform in the market despite declining user engagement and pullback of brand advertising dollars -- largely due to mobile advertising performance - especially App Install advertisements. This is a huge red flag because it indicates that sustainable brand dollars have not yet moved to Facebook mobile platform and mobile revenue growth has been driven by technology companies (many of which are VC funded). VC dollars are being spent on user acquisition despite unknown LTV of users - a recipe for disaster. This props up Facebook share price and continues to justify VC investment in technology products based on abnormally large mkt cap companies (i.e. &quot;If this company attracts just 5% of users that FB has, it will be HUGE&quot; - fuels spend on user acquisition as user growth is tied to values). When the market for tech stocks cools, Facebook market cap will plummet, access to capital for unproven businesses will become inaccessible, and ad spend on user acquisition will rapidly decrease - compounding problems for Facebook and driving stock even lower. Instagram may be only saving grace if they are able to ramp advertising product fast enough. Total internet advertising spend cannot justify outsized valuations of social media products that derive revenue from advertising. Feed-based advertising units will plummet in value (in the case of Twitter, advertising spend may not move beyond experimental dollars) similar to earlier devaluing of Internet display advertising.",1420413169

8836280,comment,8829194,8830492,0,0,dap,,,"> Great! One of the inventors of ZFS and one of the ZFS tech leads from Sun were available. But what about if the average user has a problem? Maybe you can give us Matt&#x27;s phone number? Is he available for pro bono consulting when Joe Sixpack has a problem?<p>That was my talk.  Your summary is a gross mischaracterization on many levels.  I&#x27;d suggest watching the video.<p>To elaborate a bit: we have almost certainly pushed the code path in question enormously harder than anyone else.  Our workload is not even close to representative of even heavy users&#x27; experiences.  We saw the bug a handful of times in about sixteen million executions.  The point isn&#x27;t that ZFS is buggy, since all complex systems have latent bugs.  The point is that if this had been a similar bug with almost any other filesystem, the result would have been unmitigated, undetected user data corruption.  Instead, it was detected, characterized, and repaired before user data was ever affected.  There was admittedly much more human intervention than we would have liked, but we never returned an incorrect byte to a user.  That&#x27;s a big deal, and that was my point.<p>In terms of support: your choice with any software is to support it yourself or hire others to support it.  ZFS is no different in this regard.<p>I apologize if my slide gave the wrong impression, but I can&#x27;t help but feel you twisted what was clearly incomplete information into a narrative of FUD.  If you want the facts, and the talk doesn&#x27;t answer your questions, do reach out.",1420412981

That&#x27;s an actual legitimate use of deauth.  (If you&#x27;re using encryption, then a rogue AP can&#x27;t impersonate the real network without knowing the encryption key.  But public networks tend to be open for convenience.  So some trickery is necessary to provide a little extra safety for users.)<p>Wifi clients are notoriously awful at roaming.  You would think they would prefer the strongest signal, but they seem to select randomly, no doubt depending on driver/firmware versions and bugs.  If you&#x27;ve ever used an enterprise WiFi network where roaming works, it&#x27;s because the APs talk to each other, make a selection as to which AP is best for you to talk to, and then deauth you from the APs that you shouldn&#x27;t be talking to.  So deauths are actually essential to making Wifi work well.  The problem in this case is that Marriott is going above and beyond industry best practices and is just trying to kill _everyone_&#x27;s Wifi, presumably for their own financial gain.  That&#x27;s a violation of FCC rules, so they&#x27;re trying to have the rules changed.<p>Meanwhile, I can just operate my network under Part 97 instead of Part 15 and it would still be illegal for them to intentionally or unintentionally interfere.

The account was disabled and was also the Google Apps admin account.  In that instance, I think Google is at least obligated to kick-off an email to the Google Apps back-up email address and alert to the issue with a time-expiring form that triggers a support request with a slightly higher priority. This could all be automated I would think.<p>I realize Google is huge and they provide critical services to many of us (I continue to use Google Apps for several domains) but the ""can't be bothered"" customer service attitude can have a significant impact on operations and I wanted to generate some awareness about that.  Looks like we succeeded on the awareness front.",1353805153

It's clearly not front page material, though.<p>Separating a large, complicated task into multiple orthogonal pieces, and assigning each of these pieces to its own component, has been a fundamental part of software engineering for many decades.<p>Separation of concerns is what OO does.  Separation of concerns is what UNIX does.  Separation of concerns is what TCP/IP does.  Separation of concerns is why global variables are considered ""bad.""  Separation of concerns is not a new idea.<p>This jargon-filled, somewhat poorly worded article is merely repeating a fundamental principle that should be obvious to anyone who's ever written any program larger than a couple hundred lines.<p>What is meant by ""[the] client is free to have full coherence of server's public domain including all its public API, domain objects and schemata""?<p>""CSDS regards hypermedia an important aspect of REST; it is a semantic web of interconnected resources. Client will have full coherence of the axes of such relationships and can effectively use to navigate the semantic web - since it is part of the public domain. But for it to become the engine of the application is server dominance.""

4826950,comment,4826159,4826159,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"SVMs require a linearly separable dataset. That would make them seem quite useless, but often that's not a huge problem, and sometimes when it is you can add basis functions as you wish, like on this data:<p><pre><code>    1  1
    2  1
    3 -1
    4 -1
    5  1
    6  1
    7 -1
</code></pre>
This data set becomes linearly separable with the basis expansion {X^2, X^3} because there's a cubic function that matches the data perfectly for signs (e.g. f(x) > 0 on all the x's mapped to 1, and f(x) < 0 on all the -1's). This doubles the size of your data matrix (4 columns, for 1, X, X^2, and X^3} in comparison to the more typical basis.<p>The problem is that if your data are noisy, you can end up needing a lot of basis expansions to get separation, and then you have the typical problems of complexity.<p>As far as I understand it, SVMs are good when you know there aren't misclassifications in the data and believe the separating surfaces (which will separate the data perfectly) will be simple because you're not going to need to add a lot of basis expansions. It seems to expect a certain orderliness in the data.<p>Neural nets are extremely flexible on account of their large number of degrees of freedom, but rarely achieve ""perfect"" classification and it's often not desirable that they do (overfitting). What they seem to be strong at is finding a very good (but not perfect) answer, and unlike SVMs which don't work well in a noisy world (can't achieve separation) they seem to handle it well. Neural nets, in my experience, will learn something in a lot of different types of environments. The major negative of neural nets is that they take a very long time to converge, and if you use stochastic gradient descent (which becomes necessary on a large data set) they will actually never converge. Also, neural net problems often require extensive cross-validation.",1353804407

I'd imagine that there would be a noticeable shift in reported crime from areas of higher CCTV concentration to those [local] areas with lower CCTV concentration. It seems that there were no particularly clear displacement effects in the case-studies in that first doc.<p>The second doc appears to make no clearer claims on displacement either.<p>Mind you we've 17 years more data now and there must be several areas where CCTV has been installed, removed (or deactivated) and possibly reinstalled.<p>There really must be better citations than this around. I've no time to dig for them now but these don't convince me that displacement is, if anything, more than a minor effect. Moreover those docs show a shift from direct personal robbery/theft to theft from vehicles; I'd expect that would result in less bodily harm overall at the expense of broken windows and bent door frames, probably a good result.<p>- - -<p>  <a href=""http://www.parliament.uk/post/pn175.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parliament.uk/post/pn175.pdf</a>, 2002<p> <a href=""http://library.npia.police.uk/docs/hopolicers/fcdps68.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.npia.police.uk/docs/hopolicers/fcdps68.pdf</a>, 1995",1353804074

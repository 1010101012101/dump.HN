10065021,comment,10064537,10064537,0,0,graycat,,,"Sure.  I&#x27;ve recently 
finished writing 18,000 programming
language statements in Visual Basic
.NET
on 80,000 lines
of typing, including comments and
blank lines, and so far I have never
even once used inheritance, either
single or multiple.  I don&#x27;t even know
how they would handle naming conflicts
with multiple inheritance.  Maybe
Microsoft&#x27;s many classes in .NET
are making heavy use of inheritance,
but I don&#x27;t.<p>So, inheritance is okay, but I don&#x27;t
use it directly.  It just isn&#x27;t a tool
I use; it stays in the bottom of my
toolbox.<p>I use classes much like structs in
C or structures in PL/I.  Yes, classes
are a little more general, and I do
make use of some of that generality.<p>But, PL/I structures are quite a bit
more general than structs in C
and, really, nearly as useful as
classes.  And, for &quot;addressing&quot; as
in the OP, the array addressing
in PL/I structures is much more
efficient than addressing in
classes.<p>The OP is correct:  I don&#x27;t think
of classes and inheritance as 
<i>representing</i> a is-a relationship.
Sorry, I just don&#x27;t do that.  Don&#x27;t
need it.  Or, I&#x27;m big on collection
classes (hopefully based on AVL or
red-black trees) and did write my
own key-value store for session
state storage for my Web site,
and that usage can be regarded
as using is-a, but, again, I don&#x27;t
get is-a from class inheritance --
just don&#x27;t need that.<p>And the OP is correct: A lot that is
in my code has its meaning clear
only in the comments.  The code is
like the displayed equations in a
calculus or physics book, 
and the text between
the displayed equations is like
the comments.  Both the text
in those books and the comments
in the code 
are crucial.<p>Yes, the <i>meaning</i> of the code is
crucial, but for <i>meaning</i> I want
to use a natural language, e.g.,
English, in the comments.",1439635901

I was once in a similar situation myself where a dear friend of mine got in big trouble while traveling in Vietnam:<p>Since the country is a Malaria area my friend took prophylactic medication (Malarone). As an (infrequent) side effect these drugs can cause hallucinations and severe anxiety attacks, which unfortunately is what happened to her. When the symptoms hit her she was alone (as the only Western person) in a small train station in Ho-Chi-Minh city and became suddenly so scared that she hid in a corner, hallucinating and unable to call out for help. Lucky for her I called her up after she failed to send me a message as we had agreed on a few days earlier and found out about the dangerous situation. And while she was not able to speak clearly she was at least able to communicate where she was to me. So, I immediately thought about how I could get help to her and tried calling the local emergency numbers using Skype, my mobile phone and my landline. As it turns out, those numbers are usually not reachable from outside the country.<p>So what I did instead (and what I would do again in a similar situation) was to call the emergency number of the local embassy / consulate in the country. These always have staff answering the phone 24/7, but unfortunately even they are not always willing to help you. It usually helps to first get the name of the person who answered the phone and then explain to him/her that the person in distress is a citizen of his/her country and that he/she is in acute danger. Also, explain to them (in case they forgot) that it is their duty to protect the life of the citizens of their country abroad and to do anything in their power to get help to them as fast as possible. They will know better than you which number to call or how to organize help (in case the emergency response system is not very functional as was the case in Vietnam). Do not waste time trying to call the local emergency numbers.",1439635810

However, we spent the first evening coordinating getting the shower fixed as it was overflowing. C&#x27;est la vie, win some lose some. Ok.<p>After that, when trying to sleep, the boiler made a very bad rattling noise, so again had to call someone about it. Again, win some lose some.<p>After that first evening, we sent a legitimate refund claim to the owner saying we can live with the (by then partially fixed) situation because we didn&#x27;t want to waste time looking for somewhere else. We requested a one day refund as it had been spent fixing stuff. We then went to bed.<p>Midnight rolls around and my wife and I are fast asleep. My phone rings and it&#x27;s the airbnb host demanding that we vacate the property, and &quot;not to worry, I will help you get a room at the hotel over the road&quot;. Why? Because we had the temerity to request a refund.<p>(Context: he later tried to explain his attitude with &quot;we should have contacted him directly because if a refund claim is put through, his property is downvoted in the airbnb listings&quot;. I have no idea if that is true).<p>He jumps in his car and an hour later, we are arguing on the doorstep about it, us in our PJ&#x27;s wondering the hell is going on.<p>Airbnb handled the situation fairly well.

The host, a girl in her early 20s, probably quite new to the city, and who we didn&#x27;t meet, left us her apartment keys (all of them): there was no combination lock on the door, i.e. nothing preventing somebody from duplicating the keys and having permanent access to the apartment. On top of that, all of her stuff was in the apartment - clothes, paperwork, jewelry - and as far as we could see (we didn&#x27;t snoop beyond looking for an iron) she didn&#x27;t have a lockbox there.<p>Obviously she&#x27;s naive, but she&#x27;s not alone; I&#x27;ve heard several similar stories. I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d have airbnb do to improve the situation; at minimum, though, requiring the use of combination door locks with guest-specific combinations would seem like a good policy, although obviously they&#x27;d lost a lot of hosts by doing so.",1439635458

10065005,comment,10063107,10064222,0,0,edanm,,,"So, you raise an interesting point. I have two follow-up questions.<p>Firstly, I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;victimless&quot; means exactly, and I think you may be taking it too literally. As people in the many comments below have pointed out, there are plenty of crimes which are &quot;victimless&quot;, e.g. taking a machine gun and &quot;spraying&quot; a crowd of people with bullets, but failing to hit anyone. Is this a &quot;victimless&quot; crime? At what point do we decide to set the bar?<p>Come to think of it, there are charges of &quot;reckless endangerment&quot;, where someone it can be a crime to do something which endangers other people in a reckless manner. Drunk driving certainly falls under those, so I&#x27;d say that drunk driving laws are simply enhancements of &quot;reckless endangerment&quot; laws, providing more specific context.<p>Secondly, we as a society will often choose to make our laws based on certain factors, like what an average citizen knows For example, driving under the influence causes a variety of physical changes that are <i>not</i> obvious and <i>not</i> known by every single driver, e.g. slower response times. These are things that a reasonable driver might not even realise are impacting them, and might not feel when they are partially drunk. But we, as a society that has done scientific tests, <i>know</i> that these effects always happen. In this case, it makes sense to block actions that we know are harmful.",1439635350

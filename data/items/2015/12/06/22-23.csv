They provide the best close air support in perhaps the entire history of military aviation worldwide (great range, extremely resilient to small arms fire, low altitude / low speed capabilities, etc.). Instead, the Marines Corps scrambles (no pun intended) to find a replacement after realizing that the JSF program wasn&#x27;t real (it turns out that the F-35 will bankrupt the Milky Way Galaxy before being finished, not to mention it has too much wing loading to provide adequate close air support). Yet, the wonderfully designed A-10 Warthog languishes in military relic status.<p>Why not make new copies these greats, with any of the little kinks worked out?",1449442760

You shouldn&#x27;t be measuring the treatment of the animals you eat relative to awful treatment they experience elsewhere in the world, you should measure it relative to the life the animals would lead naturally [edited from &quot;in the wild&quot;].

There are persistent claims that companies keep them on the road for more hours than their drivers are legally allowed to work, but they&#x27;re politically shielded from official investigations.  It would be nice for citizen groups to have the tools to investigate those claims.<p>If we should be able to go about free of day-to-day surveillance (absent good, court-approved cause), which I certainly agree with, then we should be modifying laws and institutions to reflect that.  Since what we&#x27;ve got is a situation where the powerful (government agencies, large companies) use the absence of regulation and powerful tools to watch <i>us</i> the second-best option is for us to have the tools to watch <i>them</i>.",1449442570

10686990,comment,10684129,10684129,0,0,kentonv,,,"The brilliant thing about capability-based security is that it turns classic object-oriented programming patterns into security patterns.<p>Access control is implemented by encapsulating private members behind a restricted public interface.<p>Polymorphism allows you to add wrappers around an object implementing arbitrary security policies. E.g. want to revoke access to this object after some time? Add a wrapper where the methods forward to the real object until revoked, and then throw exceptions instead.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that these are patterns we are doing anyway, in real code, not for the purpose of security but for the purpose of correctness and maintainability. Because we were doing these things anyway, our programming languages provide really good tools for making them work naturally, and we already know how to think about them.<p>On the other hand, the competing model -- access control lists (ACLs), and other types of externally-specified policy -- are not things we were doing anyway. They&#x27;re external concepts bolted into the system awkwardly. Because of this, they tend to be painful to maintain, which in turn means people often don&#x27;t bother.<p>One of the clearest examples of how ACLs go against the grain: An ACL is a list of entities who are allowed to access a resource. These are effectively pointers pointing in the <i>opposite direction</i> of all other pointers in the system: ACLs point <i>from</i> the callee <i>to</i> the caller. This creates all kinds of problem. Just try to imagine how, in a programming language, you would specify the allowed callers of your object.<p>This translates to UX, too: Say you are using Google Docs, and you want to &quot;share&quot; access to a document with Alice. Traditionally this is seen (by the implementers -- I was once on the Google Docs sharing team) as a two-step process:<p>1. Grant access: Add Alice to the access control list.<p>2. Notify: Send Alice an e-mail notifying her that she should open the document.<p>Part 2 is obviously necessary and natural. You intuitively know you must tell Alice about your document.<p>Part 1 may sound obvious to any techie, but it&#x27;s not at all: Users regularly forget this step, and we build all kinds of UI to try to recover from this. And even if it were obvious, it&#x27;s problematic. What if Alice doesn&#x27;t have a Google account? What if she does, but I don&#x27;t know the email address tied to that account, because it&#x27;s not her usual address?<p>What we really want to do is eliminate part 1 and have only part 2: Abstractly, when you notify Alice of the document, that notification should itself <i>contain</i> the permission to access the document. Then I don&#x27;t need to know Alice&#x27;s Google account ID, I just need to know how to send her a message containing the permissions. (This is analogous to sending a pointer in code -- receiving the pointer grants the recipient the ability to access the pointed-to object.)<p>This is the essence of capability-based security at the UX level: Deriving access control from actions you were already doing. The user rarely needs to be confronted with a security action, yet the right people end up getting access.<p>Some will argue that such implicit security is inherently dangerous because it&#x27;s hard to audit and control. I argue that &quot;explicit&quot; security is dangerous because it&#x27;s hard for users to understand and use correctly -- inevitably, many will simply turn the security off.<p>But there&#x27;s a compromise: If the underlying system deeply understands capabilities and knows when they are being passed, it can maintain an &quot;access control list&quot; on the side, automatically populating it based on the observed movement of capabilities. This pseudo-ACL can allow the user to audit who has access to their document and revoke people who shouldn&#x27;t be there. It also offers a place to hook in policies: if the system observes a capability movement that is contrary to some explicit policy (say, &quot;documents shall not be shared outside the organization&quot;), then it can revoke that capability.<p>This is the model we&#x27;re implementing in Sandstorm:<p><a href=""https://sandstorm.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sandstorm.io</a><p><a href=""https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/security-practices/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/developing/security-prac...</a><p>And Cap&#x27;n Proto RPC implement capabilities at the network level:<p><a href=""https://capnproto.org/rpc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://capnproto.org/rpc.html</a><p>(I am the lead developer of both Sandstorm and Cap&#x27;n Proto.)<p>Other good reading:<p><a href=""http://srl.cs.jhu.edu/pubs/SRL2003-02.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://srl.cs.jhu.edu/pubs/SRL2003-02.pdf</a> - Capability Myths Demolished, an academic paper.<p><a href=""http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/10/objects-as-secure-capabilities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/10/objects-as-secure-capabil...</a> - About Microsoft&#x27;s Midori research OS, which was also based on this model.",1449441363

Though Windows phone is not a huge success, there are a lot of tablet/pcs running apps which are already made for ipads and such get a decent pass at running simply in the windows store.<p>2) Just because an app &#x27;can&#x27; run on multiple platforms, doesn&#x27;t mean it should. WORA has been promised forever, and quite honestly, has never really worked. But if I have an app that measures exposure to sunlight and passes that data to a web-app, it has no UI directly connected to it, and it is likely not useful on a tablet, but it is useful on a IoT device and on my phone. What about Angry Birds, why can&#x27;t it run on phone, tablet, and XBox? Nobody says EVERY app has to run across all the platforms, just that you can run your apps on more than one platform. Pick the platforms that best suit your needs.<p>3) the comment about continuity and airplay ignores that fact that with the &#x27;box with cables&#x27;, I don&#x27;t have multiple devices, I have a phone and a dock. That is quite different from having to have a phone and a matching desktop or tablet. Not saying continuity and airplay aren&#x27;t any good, but they are just different.<p>4) paying people to build apps, when you&#x27;re losing the war it isn&#x27;t a horrible strategy, and if nobody takes advantage, it doesn&#x27;t cost anything.",1449440928

How do we look at the statistics he proposes?  Do we look at the last election or the last decade or since the last redistricting?  His analysis showed single sets of races, but US states have bicameral legislatures... do we somehow combine those results or pick and chose?  Do we, as the author did, discount third party participation and if so isn&#x27;t that also biasing redistricting efforts in favor of two parties that are not as different as most would like to admit?  Do we choose our time frame ad hoc at the time of redistricting?<p>How do we deal with this problem:  we have a district that was itself gerrymandered at one point in time to ensure that a significant racial minority had sufficient electoral clout in at least some districts (including our example).  Now that district votes for Party A consistently, but the mean vs. average approach shows that the redistricting unduly favors Party B... do we meet the aims of inclusion or do we try to ensure that political parties are not advantaged/disadvantaged at redistricting time?<p>The real problem here is that democracy has become this important at all.  Rather than worry about how to best preserve the rights of each individual from undue interference from anyone (including government officials) we are more worried about ensuring that we are not unduly disadvantaged in having access to the force that government represents: and in so doing ensuring that we can use it against those we don&#x27;t favor for the benefit of those that we do.",1449440031

They&#x27;re old, and so the Air Force wants to replace them, with the KC-46, which is pretty much a Boeing 767 but with seats replaced with big gas tank, and boom off the back. The 767 isn&#x27;t a new airframe, it&#x27;s a 30 year old design.  And aerial refueling isn&#x27;t a new technology either. Afterall, the plane that&#x27;s being replaced has been in service for almost 60 years. Proven airframe. Proven technology. This is a slam dunk right?<p>Well, no. The KC-46 keeps getting delayed.[1] It&#x27;s essentially too complicated and too flashy. For exampe, Boeing is ditching the tried and true, and dirt simple system of guiding refueling booms by having a guy look at a window and put the boom into the receptacle, and instead go with some unproven system using an occulus rift and stereo cameras. Why? I don&#x27;t know. I guess because it&#x27;s &quot;high tech&quot;.<p>And do you want to know the most damning part of all? Boeing currently sells the KC-767, a refueling tanker based on the 767 airframe, that not only works, but is cheaper than the KC-46, and available today!<p>It&#x27;s almost as bad as the F-35 debacle, but not quite.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think the military knows how to buy anything, and the contractors take advantage of that. It&#x27;s Eisenhower&#x27;s Military-Industrial Complex writ large.<p>[1] <a href=""http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/broken-booms-why-is-it-so-hard-to-develop-procure-a-1698725648"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/broken-booms-why-is-it-so-h...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_KC-46_Pegasus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_KC-46_Pegasus</a>",1449439322

Older B-52 variants (pre-G) were retired when they couldn&#x27;t take the load, because they were designed for max altitude cruise and weapons delivery.  A big part of the B-1A to B-1B redesign involved removing the fancy high-altitude air intakes and restressing for extended treetop flight (and reducing RCS).",1449439247
10686849,comment,10686336,10686688,0,0,semi-extrinsic,,,"FWIW, the Boeing E3 Sentry (the &quot;AWACS plane&quot;) was based on the Boeing 707.<p>But for a B-52 replacement, I think civilian planes have quite a few problems. For one, the wings are attached in the wrong place; on the B-52 they&#x27;re more to the front, since the bomb bay has to be at the centre of balance. (Otherwise the plane becomes difficult to control after dropping the payload.) Another issue is that a commercial jet has a unneccesarily wide body, increasing drag. (Bombs are much denser than people.) A third is that commercial jets probably can&#x27;t take the same level of structural loads in case of evasive action, particularly at lower altitudes. Compare the AWACS example: that airplane should never come close to enemy fire. A bomber most certainly would have to.<p>All those are engineering challenges, and could be solved. I guess the biggest reason is that it would cost more than you would gain.",1449439236

8373873,comment,8372795,8373612,4,0,skinnybatch,,,"I would posit that there are two categories of MOOC students: those that seek out classrooms to learn focused knowledge; and those that find the online education style appealing.<p>The former category, I believe, is far more driven. These students are self-motivated, with a drive/need to learn and digest the information quickly and/or in their own timeframe (the &quot;binge learners,&quot; similar to the binge watchers of entire seasons of television shows on Netflix).<p>The second category of MOOC students is more nebulous to me. Without specific intent and purpose, but enthralled by the potential to take courses and/or get course credit online, their urge to engage is simply less.<p>You, joshontheweb, clearly are of the first category, as am I, and I can sympathize with the irritation and frustration of waiting for material to appear.<p>The greater issues, as I see them, regarding MOOC and a free university education online, are that of measurement, breadth, and accountability. Taking courses online is akin to having a class where all the exams and benchmarks are &quot;take-homes.&quot; We have no way to measure what is actually being learned, consumed, digested, encoded vs what is simply being spit back from a book or other source. What&#x27;s more, when something is free, somehow people often don&#x27;t value it in quite the same way. Ask someone to pay $5 for a class, and even that may motivate a different participation and engagement level. Kind of like buying a series of workout sessions with a personal trainer - you&#x27;re far more likely to show up to the gym.<p>In regards to the breadth issue, universities make you take courses across a number of subjects and categories in order to make sure you have some basic foundational coursework under your belt. We may not have all enjoyed all of these categorically required classes, and if nothing else, a few left me with some fodder for dinner party conversation. The online university education system, in order to be truly beneficial, functional, and comparable for degree programs, will have to lay out some common minimum and breadth requirements, that may provide a replicable experience for students truly interested in pursuing an advanced degree. Of course, this really doesn&#x27;t apply to those interested merely in enrichment and in-depth instruction on specific topics rather than a degree program. For these students, the availability of knowledge and practical implementation exercises is all that matters.<p>Finally, I see an issue with accountability, as in the difficulty with provided online students with enough structure and deadline as to promote a sense of onus and accountability. As noted earlier, this also ties in directly with the issue of not paying for coursework. Some might argue that releasing information weekly provides students with a benchmark of when and where they should be learning material; however, arguably, releasing the material from the get-go, and establishing an end-date for the course, by which time students must complete all graded coursework, would also suffice. I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it yet, but somewhere the measure of accountability within this space falls short. There is a nebulous void between the sources and recipients of knowledge and education online. Maybe it&#x27;s the lack of true interaction, maybe it&#x27;s the lack of classroom (the engagement of a finite group of students, seated next to each other, forced to endure the annoying drone of the heavy breather sitting next to you, the random but startling crackling of the lecturer&#x27;s microphone, the timely malfunction of the overhead projector, the ripe and palpable angst during an exam…), or maybe it&#x27;s just not education as I know, or knew, it, which doesn&#x27;t mean a darn thing.<p>Having been in educational settings, both one-on-one and classroom, I fear I am quick to think of the students for whom this type of educational forum would be useless. Those students who look for the shortcuts, and simply want the accolades and recognition for having done something, with little impetus to do the work. Instead, as I write this, I think about the students for whom MOOC will truly be revolutionary and life-altering. For those students, who could not afford nor gain access to higher education, but who would do <i>anything</i> for it, then I imagine and hope that it would be for them that we would not have to worry about precise measurement and accountability. Instead, they will hopefully relish the opportunity to learn, breadth and all, striving to turn the opportunity into reality, recharting the courses of their futures, and approaching MOOC with gratitude and integrity.",1411754334

We&#x27;re probably only a few years away from a mainstream and popular form-factor that&#x27;s a fraction of the size, with tiny SSDs instead of giant spinning drives and power-sipping x86 or ARM chips.

From your Wikipedia link:<p>> The main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization. Virtualization software allows a physical computing device to be electronically separated into one or more &quot;virtual&quot; devices, each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks. With operating system–level virtualization essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices, idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently. Virtualization provides the agility required to speed up IT operations, and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization. Autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources on-demand. By minimizing user involvement, automation speeds up the process, reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors.[27]<p>Admittedly, it depends on what he wants to do with this that would determine whether it&#x27;s &quot;really&quot; a cloud or not.",1411753990

They would remain thicker for longer around the edges (assuming the pane is embedded solidly in a frame) and any support elements that hold it firmly. The top edge would sag more quickly in the middle. Heck, prevailing winds, if any, would slowly push the pane inwards, like a soap bubble.<p>The neat shallow wedge shape simply cannot be obtained via regular viscous flow in a near-vertical pane.<p>---<p>Also, if mere gravity could change the shape that much, any load-bearing glass element supporting a heavy item would sag visibly in a much shorter time.

It is paid by taxpayers, exactly as I said. Yes that&#x27;s really great that for all these money I had 40% chances of dying vs 10% in the US for the cost of 300usd a month.<p>> If you couldn&#x27;t afford the 90% chance in the US, your chance of recovery was probably 0%.<p>That&#x27;s something I honestly don&#x27;t know. If you are homeless - they won&#x27;t treat you? Are you sure? How do you know?<p>> So, presenting it as 60% or 90% is a false comparison.<p>It is very true when you are diagnosed with stage 2 renal cancer. Let&#x27;s not generalize. The cancers and many other diseases have the best chances to be treated in the US.<p>> What you fail to understand is that many people in the United States would like the same 60% chance funded by the taxpayer that you enjoy in Germany.<p>At the cost of others - like me - who are just middle class (~100k/year) having now 60% chances instead of 90%. Typical in socialism: let&#x27;s make it worse for everyone and call equality. Because now chances off everyone are just 60%. How is that better?<p>>To quote some other numbers at you, Infant Mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) by the CIA 2013 estimate in the United States is 5.2, in Germany it&#x27;s 3.48.<p>I can see that. You see that&#x27;s my point. EU is great at being mediocre. USA has the lowest valleys and the highest peaks. It has the worst and the best. So then it comes down to &quot;taste&quot; really. Not that using &quot;taste&quot; in morality is fine, but it&#x27;s about the world view really. Do you think that you should work hard, save, invest, have good education, pay for great health coverage? Or do you think that everybody should have the same chances no matter what they do in their lives? I don&#x27;t think that EU model is that great after living here for a while. It&#x27;s like living in a golden cage. You are slave of the state that decides for you and robs you from most of your money. In my personal view selling my freedom for safety isn&#x27;t a solution.

What I don&#x27;t understand is why these people don&#x27;t immigrate to Canada or Western Europe as many Europeans who believe in freedom do choose to live in the US.

Since the 2008 crash, the Fed has been using a policy of &quot;Quantitive Easing&quot; (QE) to keep interest rates artificially low and thus encourage lending and spending. It&#x27;s been known for while that the Feds were looking to end this policy sometime this year and it&#x27;s looking like the end of October will be that time. Although the Feds seem to indicate that they won&#x27;t actually raise interest rates until sometime next year, halting QE will have the affect of making less money available for lending. No one is really sure what is going to happen but this is an event that will affect the economy as a whole. To me, it&#x27;s sounding like one of the industries that could be particularly affected by this policy is Tech and the result will be a market correction in startup valuations.<p>Links!\n<a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp</a>\n<a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/01/economist-explains-7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/01/ec...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2014/09/23/the-end-of-the-qe-era-is-upon-us-whats-next/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2014/09/23/the-end-of-t...</a>\n<a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/08/05/goldman-sachs-heres-what-will-happen-when-fed-raises-interest-rates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/08/05/goldman-sachs-here...</a>",1411751660

What worries Andreessen, Gurley, Wilson, and other investors with decades of experience is that many startups today are burning cash by spending on things that do not increase business value -- and in some cases actually destroy it -- without worrying for even a moment about the possibility of running out of money.<p>In Andreessen&#x27;s words: &quot;Lots of people, big shiny office, high expense base = Fake &#x27;we’ve made it!&#x27; feeling.

And so this is why it&#x27;s all cyclical—because the landlords get greedy. They wouldn&#x27;t do a 10-year lease if they thought that the rates were low. So they&#x27;re implicitly telling you they want to lock this in for 10 years, which is its own form of greed because what happened in &#x27;99 is half the companies went bankrupt and they couldn&#x27;t pay the lease over the 10-year period.&quot;[2]<p>In Wilson&#x27;s words: &quot;I’ve pushed back on long term leases that I thought were outrageous, I’ve pushed back on spending plans that I thought were too aggressive and too risky, I’ve made myself a pain in the ass to more than a few CEOs.&quot;[3]<p>Their worry, in short, is that <i>many</i> VC-funded startups are burning cash <i>stupidly</i>.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/515219433695223809"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/515219433695223809</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/venture-capitalist-sounds-alarm-on-silicon-valley-risk-1410740054"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/articles/venture-capitalist-sounds-ala...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://avc.com/2014/09/burn-baby-burn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avc.com/2014/09/burn-baby-burn/</a>",1411751630

In some instances, FedEx tracking would mark a package as &quot;delivered&quot; when it was just dropped it off at the local post office.  When I was living in Brooklyn, this basically meant I was going to get a pink slip on my mail box within the next 3 days (even though I work from home, they NEVER rang the bell).  And since, apparently, none of the local carriers were delivering packages in the neighborhood, this meant I was going to have to wait in a line of disgruntled neighbors with pink slips dangling from clenched fists for at least half an hour and often twice that.<p>Because of this, I would generally avoid FedEx when it was an option.

If you offer short cycle times, you lower your delivery density (distance between deliveries).<p>* Market Share. The more customers you have, the higher your delivery density.<p>* Range.

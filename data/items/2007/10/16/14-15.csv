It's not very ""web like"", but it can do stuff that makes my head hurt when thinking of programming it even on top of Rails. \n",1192546636
68543,comment,68535,68535,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Here's a bit of advice: be a startup junkie and not just a YC applicant.<p>\nStartup junkies sill always follow startups: participating, sharing ideas, forming teams and making things happen. Being a startup junkie isn't something that is limited to any one funding cycle or organization. If you're a real junkie, YC is just a place to hang out while you're working on your own plans, which may have nothing to do with YC in the end. YC is just a tool which may or may not be available to you. If nothing else, you can monitor the board and listen while all kinds of cool stuff happens -- there's gold in being part of those conversations.<p>\nOr as the old saying goes, ""I've been kicked out of better places than this one""",1192546377

I did not apply for this funding cycle.<p>1). <i>Don't take it personally.</i> <p>YC was kind enough to send a very nice email explaining that their decision wasn't personal. The email explained how their process is fraught with error. They were even nice enough to say there was a good chance they passed over promising groups of hackers. It's not personal and sometimes an application doesn't do justice to your abilities. <p>2). <i>YC is not for everyone</i> <p>Sure, YC would make the whole startup process a lot easier and a lot more exciting, but you can still be very successful without YC. There are lots of successful companies out there that probably haven't even heard of YC.  The honest truth is: being successful is completely in your control. <p>3). <i>Don't write scathing blog posts</i> <p>After the decisions were made, a few people wrote scathing blog posts, designed to rip YC a new one. It doesn't work, it won't make you feel better and it just makes you look like an emotional train wreck. Don't air your dirty laundry. If you feel wronged or emotionally charged, refer to #1, then #2, then #4.<p>4). <i>Shorten the cycle</i> <p>Eventually, the rejection will wear off and you'll get back to work. Some people might obsess for a few days, others a few weeks. Eventually though, you will get back to work on your ideas. If that's true, then why not shorten the cycle? Give yourself an hour to feel like crap (if that helps) then get back to work.\n <p>\nI know many of you will see this advice as obvious, but when the email notifications go out it won't be. That's why I'm posting it now.<p>\n",1192545422

68523,comment,68111,68111,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I like the flood idea. While we still have limits, a simple filter that roughly gauges potential interest in the file would help make this possible to implement today.<p>Add an app to your iphone that discovers other iphones. It'll probably be bluetooth. Then add a mechanism to transfer files automatically between the iPhones, probably wifi. In addition, to get past the 4 or 8 GB limit, backup unplayed or unlikely-to-be-played songs to a private music repository whenever a wifi internet connection is available.<p>This system can be built with today's hardware, and is essentially under the radar of music companies -- more so than bittorrent.<p>But this really emphasizes the need for recommendation systems -- the only thing the labels are actually good at. Have you ever tried to find something you might like on bittorrent? Almost impossible. P2P apps of yore were better. You could see someones playlists. You could discover new things when grouped near things you know you like.<p>But that has nothing to do with quality. Especially in niche genres (and everything is going the way of the niche), quality matters. There are many failures for each success in a style.<p>Any ideas on a quality detection system? :-P\n",1192544199

But you're right - if they aren't as active as they were you could run into a community that wants to pass them by (viva la revolution!) but is hindered by the status quo. Still, with so many voices, I'm not sure I'd be concerned. Anyone who accumulates karma would get the voice to match.<p>P.s. I say all this knowing that my own votes would likely lose value. But that's cool with me since I don't get to hang out here as much as I'd like. Better to make the keepers of the community the ones who have the most invested. What's nice about karma is that it's recognition by other community members that your voice matters.",1192543565

There was another article on the list today about failing a lot to succeed. Dedication and a great team will always overcome, but they will overcome only if they fail quickly and explore the chaos and randomness of the problem domain. At the risk of link-spamming, I wrote in my blog this morning about the role that divergent thinking has on social networks. <a href=""http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2007/10/do_you_want_mor.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2007/10/do_you_want_m...</a>\nI think Paul and others make the same point in regards to how it's better to be in the valley than in Deluth -- you can harness the randomness better there.<p>\nAs hackers and analytical people, we've been brought up to feel like we should take a direct path from point A to point B. But it never works like that in the real world. Good solution-based thinking is divergent, and understands and accepts that you're not following a recipe as much as you're playing a game of chance -- but playing very cleverly!",1192543292

6285858,comment,6285654,6285654,2,0,jacquesm,,,"Hm. That&#x27;s not the nicest quote to be out there (it&#x27;s missing quite a bit of important context too). Paul you should really either retract that or nuance it but as it sits this reads pretty bad, <i>even if it might be true</i>.<p>But I doubt it is true, accents have nothing to do with people&#x27;s brains, they have everything to do with what your first language was and for how long that language was your only language. If you were born in Bulgaria, Hungary or a hundred other places and your first exposure to English in bulk and attempts to speak it started at the age of 10 or later you&#x27;ll have a fairly strong accent no matter what. It&#x27;s just how your throat cavity, voice box and lips will be muscled. If you tried to speak Finnish you&#x27;d likely have a very strong accent.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not 100% in the head or unable to communicate clearly, for instance, you could write, or you could communicate in your mother tongue. That YC finds itself in the English speaking community and tends to address an English speaking audience with its start-ups and prefers to communicate in English does not mean that those are the only ways of doing things.<p>Maybe people would have to work a little harder at understanding you but I think that it would need more than this quote and some of the original context to establish that such a thing is an indicator of not being able to run a business, or even that your experience to date is relevant anywhere outside of the start-up community.<p>This quote will be used against you, it will be spun to read you&#x27;re xenophobic or worse. Do something about it before it gets legs.",1377633450
6285857,comment,6285654,6285654,1,0,Jemaclus,,,"I was rather surprised when he said that. Not that strong foreign accents tend to fail, but more that he would actually say such an un-politically correct thing.<p>One thing entrepreneurs have to do is sell. Not just products, but ideas, visions, and strategies. They have to be able to convert industry talk into laymen&#x27;s terms. They need to be able to convince someone who doesn&#x27;t know anything about X that Y is the way to go.<p>While a strong foreign accent isn&#x27;t necessarily the bottleneck, it is probably highly correlated with with a weaker grasp on the English language -- particularly idiomatic English, as PG pointed out. If I ask you to ELI5 your business, generally the best way to go about that is to use an analogy, but if your grasp of idiomatic English doesn&#x27;t allow you to construct an elegant analogy, then you&#x27;re going to miss out on a great opportunity to explain your product/idea/vision to me.<p>To be fair to non-English speaking entrepreneurs, this isn&#x27;t specifically a language problem. There are people who speak perfectly good idiomatic English that can&#x27;t speak in layman&#x27;s terms. A good example of this is a Calculus professor at a college. They&#x27;re so good at calculus and higher-level math that explaining simple algebra is often very difficult. &quot;What do you mean you don&#x27;t understand that y = 2x + 5 draws a graph that looks like this?!? It&#x27;s easy!&quot; But for someone who doesn&#x27;t understand slope and algebra, it&#x27;s NOT intuitive. There are tons of people who have this problem.<p>Having said that, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there&#x27;s a higher correlation of poor communication skills to strong foreign accents.",1377633440

Midwest/Californian/New England/Texan are all mutually comprehensible but there are some deep-south accents (I am thinking particularly of rural South Carolina) that can cause the exact same sort of communication friction.<p>Also, I doubt a strong English accent would cause much trouble, despite being both strong and foreign.",1377633416

Take every day tasks when working with a team right now.  I spend days writing documents solely for the purpose of communicating ideas from my own head to others.  Still even with extensive documents with images, and text, miscommunication is not uncommon.<p>Even still, when I program  I mostly have an &quot;image&quot; of the program in my head.  Imagine if a computer knew me well enough to translate that &quot;image&quot; to actual code.<p>This kind of stuff is a LONG ways away... but it seems like the basic concepts are being proven, and its both exciting and scary.

Lately, however, with improvements to logstash, better default settings, and elasticsearch being awesome, the &#x27;inflation&#x27; number gets down to something more like 1.5x - which isn&#x27;t bad considering all the awesome you get with it.<p>Long term, I am working towards making the &#x27;raw data to stored data&#x27; ratio something less than 1x.<p>You can see some experiments I did a year ago on this: <a href=""https://github.com/jordansissel/experiments/blob/master/elasticsearch/disk/README.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jordansissel/experiments/blob/master/elas...</a><p>I will repeat these experiments after the next release of logstash, and I expect storage ratios to improve significantly.",1377633198

Erlang handles the concurrency itself instead of relying on the OS. A concurrent entity in Erlang, called Erlang process, is much lighter than a standard OS process or thread, initially using about 3 KB of memory on a 64bit system. In a typical Erlang systems, you can easily create hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of Erlang processes. The Erlang virtual machine uses its own scheduler which ensures that each process gets a fair share of execution time. The scheduler also distributes processes over available CPU cores, using as few OS threads as possible (by default only as much as the number of available CPU cores).&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.theerlangelist.com/2012/12/yet-another-introduction-to-erlang.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theerlangelist.com/2012/12/yet-another-introducti...</a><p>It is kind of like Node in that it is very easy to do concurrent stuff, except instead of nested callbacks and all that jazz, you write &#x27;processes&#x27; which are designed to share nothing. They run akin to OS threads in that one process crashing won&#x27;t bring down the whole system (unlike Node). As no state is shared it also means that they can easily (i.e. it is built into the VM, and switched on by default) be scaled up to run over many cores. If you are interested, you might want to look at Elixir (a language built on top of the Erlang VM) which has a more Ruby-esque syntax: <a href=""http://elixir-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elixir-lang.org/</a><p>EDIT: Should also point out that I think &quot;Jessica&#x27;s&quot; comment was just trolling, however it isn&#x27;t far from the truth :)",1377632886

So, with that disclosure out of the way... =)<p>I have to admit, I don&#x27;t agree with the assertion that the cognitive dissonance associated with programming in an imperative way versus a functional way is a major problem to Scala. I realize personal preference is a very big part of this, but there are many problems which are just easier to solve in a functional way versus an imperative way. Of course, the opposite holds true as well. This is the beauty of Scala; one can write performance-critical imperative code while exposing a functional interface; or, one can consume a fluent functional interface to produce imperative code.<p>Frankly, I guess I&#x27;ve become something of a functional zealot, so my problem with Go is that it&#x27;s so stubbornly imperative. This is why I can&#x27;t get behind Go, as much as I want to. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t consider many of the lessons that have been learned about FP making life easier. Set operations (map, filter, reduce) are insanely common, yet doing them imperatively sucks to the point of discouraging them. Excessive mutability is difficult to reason about. Nobody expects the nil/null/none inquisition. We tend to forget about side effects. Without an extensible language, which requires truly first-class functions, you&#x27;re at the language designer&#x27;s mercy.<p>Hell, Scala probably isn&#x27;t the be-all, end-all answer to all of this. I just don&#x27;t think that a doggedly-imperative, non-composable, statement-oriented language is the future of programming &quot;in the large&quot;, not when the past has shown us that we tend to produce buggy, unmaintainable software this way. I&#x27;m pragmatic enough to realize that pure FP isn&#x27;t a solution, but I feel strongly that sticking to traditional imperative because it&#x27;s familiar is a costly mistake.<p>I can&#x27;t argue with your take on the syntax, though, since that&#x27;s personal preference. =) If you have any thoughts on why you feel productive in Go, I&#x27;d love to hear them; as I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;ve been really struggling with motivating myself to learn and enjoy it.",1377632609

You can only make a highway so dense...there&#x27;s one-four lanes, and it&#x27;s like minesweeper. You can be surrounded by six cars at a time, maximum (two on either side, one above and one behind). Density might increase the likelihood of an accident just because there&#x27;s more objects in motion, but an individual autonomous car would theoretically account for this.<p>2) The entire point of an autonomous car is for drivers to not need to react to anything at all. So...I&#x27;m not sure what this has to do with risk. Maybe the drivers of non-autonomous cars wouldn&#x27;t be safe...but that&#x27;s the same situation as today. Autonomous car drivers could read a magazine in the middle of an accident. Who cares?<p>3) Again, my above comment, this doesn&#x27;t seem relevant.<p>I think you&#x27;re being a bit hysterical, to be honest. It&#x27;s a problem of math. You can model every possible interaction between the cars on a 3-dimensional plane with a finite number of axes. It might be complex, but we can <i>program every single possible interaction and collision</i> - and that&#x27;s the first step to programming collision response.<p>Basically, the takeaway is, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a model of car interaction that isn&#x27;t improved by having an autonomous car, even if only one car out of the two is autonomous.

I find its PIM, Kontact, is hands down the best such tool I&#x27;ve encountered in any environment (though for straight email, mutt still wins).<p>No, the problem is that <i>perfectly serviceable applications</i> get utterly buggered by the brain-death of the underlying toolkit.  By changing functionality as fundamental as middle-click mouse behavior.  And it&#x27;s reached the point that <i>being a GNOME application is a liability:  I&#x27;m going to look at it cross-eyed and search out an alternative if at all possible.</i><p>As another poster noted, his use of a venerable old window manager, in his case, Enlightenment DR16, means he <i>isn&#x27;t</i> subject to an entire class of insults:  &quot;creeping featurism/bloat slowing down or interfering with overall responsiveness, or this recent distressing trend to remove well-established features and behaviors.&quot;<p>The simple fact is that the basics of a GUI desktop were established <i>40 years ago</i>[1], and most of the changes since have involved price, performance, graphics rendering quality, and a very small number of behavioral modifications.<p>Technology offers diminishing returns to scale, and there&#x27;s only so much benefit <i>any</i> graphical environment can offer by changing.  And in doing so it <i>loses</i> its key benefit:  familiarity.  <i>NO</i> graphical environment is fully intuitive, it&#x27;s all learned.  <i>Tossing out that learning on a regular basis is an anti-feature.</i><p>And so pdkl95 uses the decade-old E16, I use WindowMaker, clone of a 1989 desktop.

6285693,comment,6283309,6285092,3,0,delluminatus,,,"I like this explanation. High school students are surprisingly smart and a little perspective -- that &quot;algebra&quot; is just manipulations in a symbolic system (and not even a special one, just very widely used) -- is sometimes all it takes to help them &quot;get it&quot; a little more.<p>It&#x27;s kind of funny, because students are taught how to use these things like numbers and operations and variables, but it&#x27;s never explained in an abstract way what &quot;algebra&quot; is or why it&#x27;s even called that. Hell, I didn&#x27;t know until I took linear algebra in college.<p>When my sister (who is currently taking algebra) asked me what &quot;algebra&quot; meant, I told her:<p>An algebra is a combination of a set of objects and a set of operations. The algebra you&#x27;re learning has real numbers as the set of objects. You know what the operations are: they&#x27;re things like multiplication, addition, sqrt, whatever. There are other algebras too that use things other than the reals.<p>As an aside, this is a great way to teach fractions as well (or at least, I like it a lot). People try to give intuitive explanations with pieces of pie or whatever but students tend to find them very confusing. You would be surprised how fucking confused students can get about fractions, I mean some just can&#x27;t wrap their heads around it <i>ever</i>. Even as adults. They&#x27;re not dumb, they try to learn fractions by &quot;intuition&quot; and, frankly, fractions aren&#x27;t intuitive. The simplest route is to just lay it out: these are objects with one expression and another expression and a line between them, and you can multiply them like this, and add them like this, and &quot;move&quot; expressions from one side of the line to the other by taking the reciprocal like this, and that&#x27;s it.",1377632162

6285618,comment,6283309,6283309,1,0,GreyZephyr,,,"Tangentially related to the article, but for many years I struggled with understanding what algebra was an more importantly why it was of interest. On one hand you had groups and rings that sort of seemed related, but they weren&#x27;t algebra&#x27;s. Then there were special techniques like linear algebra and I could see that they were all sort of similar but why they were of interest and all considered to be part of the same subject escaped me. Sure they were interesting in a way and group theory was sort of cool but what was the point? Analysis on the other hand made sense, it was the study of how continuous things changed. As a result I though of algebra as a sort of collection of things that you got when you discretized continuous objects. Lie algebra&#x27;s and groups came as a bit of a shock, but they were basically still thought of algebra as discrete.<p>Many of my friends raved about its beauty, but I still had no intuition as to why it was interesting. I went on a bit of a reading binge, and eventually ended up  bumping into some papers of Shafarevich[0] which in turn lead me to his delightful book on algebra [1]. In it he defines algebra as the construction and study of systems of measurement. For example counting is the simplest such system and gives the natural numbers. Attempts to describe and measure the diagonal of the unit square gave irrational numbers. As we explored the world we needed to construct new systems. A more recent example is provided by quantum mechanics, where numbers are insufficient to describe our observations, however Hilbert space provides a natural setting. Attempts to describe what a simultaneous measurement of two quantities is find a natural description as commuting operators. He provides many other examples in his very readable book. For whatever reason this definition of algebra resonated with me and if this was a Zen koan I would say I was enlightened.<p>This is really just a very long winded way of saying that I think Shafarevich&#x27;s book in which he defines algebra as the study of measurement is lovely. You should read it if such things interest you.<p>[0]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Shafarevich"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Shafarevich</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/books/about/Basic_Notions_of_Algebra.html?id=CHadhWO4DWYC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com/books/about/Basic_Notions_of_Al...</a>",1377631580

This paper (linked below) is actually what got me thinking about this whole thing. The author argues in it how functions in functional programming languages aren&#x27;t really like mathematical functions, because they have the possibility to execute infinitely (never halt) and thus not have a proper return value. To mitigate that, he creates &quot;<i>total functional programming</i>&quot;.<p><i>Total</i> functions are guaranteed to have a return value (i.e. terminate eventually), but they could take very long to run. If we could actually have complexity bounds, or be able to determine a given function&#x27;s complexity, that would be a great boon to software engineering (i.e. assuming they adopt it... which is a whole different matter).<p>The author also makes a very good point that most parts of your program are meant to terminate (i.e. the vast set of functions and algorithms that comprise you program). Only the top-level needs to be Turing-complete, the rest can at least be <i>total</i>.<p>I actually want to see if it&#x27;s possible to push this concept further, to create a ring-like hierarchy of languages -- the lowest one being the weakest and the one we can extract the most static assertions out of, and so on. There&#x27;s a language called <i>Hume</i>[2] that sounds like it accomplishes at least part of this goal, but I haven&#x27;t really looked into it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jucs.org/jucs_10_7/total_functional_programming/jucs_10_07_0751_0768_turner.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jucs.org/jucs_10_7/total_functional_programming/j...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_%28programming_language%2...</a>",1377631307

There won&#x27;t be a hyperloop designed for freight - most freight runs perfectly fine on existing rail lines.  Part of the reason why passenger rail in the US sucks is that it shares lines with freight the safety standards for freight are more lax, for obvious reasons, and the speed tolerances lower, so passenger rail is restricted to lower speeds on freight lines, then amtrak has to make exorbitant payouts to rent-seekers like BNSF and Norfolk Southern (the most egregious of them, IIRC) just to rent back that right of way.",1377630205

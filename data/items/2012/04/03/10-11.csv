As far as drug use and prostitution are concerned I'll go with history and note that humans will always be doing both.<p>Now, in response to someone raising prostitution, if consensual, being okay you responded with a link to a UN report on human trafficking and a US study on drugs and prostitution being highly correlated.<p>These are fair points to raise, my position would be that if various countries decriminalised drug use and prostitution then they could be regulated as many other activities and industries are which would lead to a strong reduction in health issues and unsavoury slave like conditions.<p>The tone of my post was to strike a response, if anything I was the one expressing an anti US (government policy) sentiment. I noted you cited a US report linking drugs and prostitution (although I note it mentioned drug use in London as well) and I reacted rather strongly to that. If you meant to imply that prostitution -> drug use + pimping then I disagree as I feel that correlation does not equal causation and personally feel that federal level policy that declares a war on drugs and regards the business of sex as immoral is more likely to be the root cause of problems.",1333449894

Its been illegal to ask these questions for 20 years, and nearly no one disputes this.<p>It's not that simple. Facebook is not the only way a prospective employer could find out those details. For example, some jobs do thorough background checks (imagine, for a security position) that no one doubts the legality of, and you could answer many of those same questions that way too. If the prospective employer learns that info, they're simply expected to disregard it while making their hiring decision, the same as they'd be expected to if they learned that info from your PUBLIC facebook page (which again no one can doubt is legal to check).<p>Stealing facebook login details does expose the company to greater liability claims in this regard, but merely uncovering those protected questions is not illegal.<p>Instead I suggest approaching Facebook login theft as a case of tortious interference, and an invasion of privacy both for the stolen account owner and anyone on their friends list. Employment discrimination will both be hard to prove, and should be settled on a case by case basis rather than legislated out of existence.",1333448001

Am writing a web application(moderately complex) in python and find myself annoyed by the amount of unit test cases needed. My reaction so far has been to write them whenever i seem to test more than a couple of times. But, have a feeling dynamic typing is actually creating problems by enlarging the number of test cases.

In stage 4, GFR falls to as low as 20 to 15, which means that decreased blood flow in the kidney and increased toxins in the body such as creatinine, blood urea nitrogen(BUN) and urea acid, and so on. When serum creatinine rises to 445umol/L, most people begin to take dialysis, which stage 4 chronic kidney disease patients do not like to accept and want to get rid of indeed. (In China, diabetic kidney disease patients take dialysis when creatinine is 300umol/L.) On one hand, dialysis is a replacement therapy which can not repair the damaged cells and enhance the immunity. On the other hand, long time dialysis will lead to a series of complications such as low blood pressure, hypophosphatemia, alkalosis, infection and so on.",1343559401

Hmm.  My reply was absolutely genuine.  You appear to be ascribing to me motives that don't exist.

That's why I asked for more information, and in particular, I asked for more details of why you said what you said, before I made any kind of judgement about your motives.<p>So thank you for your reply, I have found it interesting and enlightening.

</code></pre>
Noted.  Personally, I've always pretty much ignored content-free, enthusiastic comments, or even down-voted and in some cases flagged them.  I do that without wondering whether people have connections, or are co-founders, or whatever, simply because I tend to act on the content (or lack thereof) rather than perceived, inferred, or supposed connections or motives.  That's just me - I don't look for conspiracies.<p><pre><code>  > You might also have noticed that many articles from this blog are

</code></pre>
So, you obviously think the high rank is undeserved.  Fair enough - why do you think that might be the case?  I know that there is a reasonably effective voting-ring detector on HN (at times possibly too aggressive) so it doesn't seem likely to me that it's just the author getting lots of cronies to upvote it.  Do you think the HN audience is insufficiently critical?<p>One reason I ask is this: for a slightly different context, I could've written this article and I would have meant every word of it.  I'm active in certain circles, and I frequently mentor and give time and advice with absolutely no expectation of return or reward.  The reason?  Pretty much exactly as listed in this item.  That's why it resonated with me, and that's why I submitted it - I'd like to see more people give back to their communities, whatever communities they may be.<p>As it happens I do get benefits in return, largely in line with those listed in the item.  It's not why I do it, it's not why I did it in the first place, and it's not why I'll continue to do it.  In truth, I think it's important on some level, and I think it's right.<p><pre><code>  > If you aren't even slightly suspicious that this article is

Well, I read things to gain insight, learn stuff, and with any luck, to become better at what I choose to do.  Sometimes I find real truths in unlikely places.<p>But here's one thing I've found.  For me, evaluating things critically for what they are, and not for where I think they come from, or why I think they've been produced, and independently of any real or assumed motives on the part of the author, works for me.  After all, the overwhelming majority of material on the web has some motivation behind it, and I deal with that by treating everything on its merits.<p>It's taken me some time to compose this reply.  I hope you find it an interesting insight into a point of view other than your own.  No doubt we won't agree, but I've learned something from you, and I hope this affords you the same opportunity.",1343557187

Even though sometimes our inventions don't work as perfectly as we expected them to. Your captcha system is new and fresh and many bots are not prepared for it. I'm sure you'll improve over time, the bots will improve over time, you'll counter, so on and so forth.<p>I'd rather have my signup system use areyouhuman than re-captcha. What makes me uneasy about using it on a massive site is the whole html5 + flash dependency. And the audio captcha alternative you have is terrible. I have better than average hearing and wasn't able to understand anything on my audio sample. That and the re-captcha system helps digitize books while areyouhuman is just playing games. Even though I hate captcha it makes me feel like I'm helping digitize a book when I use recaptcha, so I feel better about it. On the other hand your games are interesting and dare I say it, a little bit addictive, especially with all those congratulatory stars at the end.",1343556597

Doing so violates the author's right to control their work because it bipasses the arrangements the author has made to control their work. Incidently, this rests on the same legal principles upon which much of FOS software community operates (the license terms are merely different).<p>However, I would recommend speaking with an attorney familiar with such matters.",1343556456

Usually these stocks are suspended and any problem trades reset.<p>Whether these are exacerbated by hft is hard to tell, but I can't see how it would help damp volatility. Probably they have more to do with momentum investors and algorithmic trading, though they can easily happen with only human trade too, just at a slower pace. Would be interesting to see stats on volatility going back decades, but it's probably quite a complex subject for a layperson.<p>Here are some examples:

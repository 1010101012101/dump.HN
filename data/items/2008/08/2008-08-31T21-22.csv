They all say something about wanting to settle down and build a career. In the majority of cases, they just can't find a contract right now, and when they do, they scarper.<p>A failed startup I'd count as valuable experience (supervising people is a pain for me, I <i>want</i> people who can think and act on their own initiative) but at the same time, I'd want a decent explanation for the abrupt career shift. ""Because I need to make some money"" is perfectly valid, and gets top marks from me for honesty.",1220218092

The only things you would do on a website are enter the address, scroll, <i>type</i> into forms, and click a link. A touchscreen only addresses the very last of these, while a keyboard deals with all of them.

You don't work for the bank, you work for the head of whatever desk or P&L. If a head of desk makes money, no-one cares what he does, he can run his own little fiefdom, a business within a business. This is one reason that banks infrastructure is such a mess, if the head of Dollar-Yen wants something he won't wait for central IT to get round to it, he'll give his geeks a budget and say <i>make it happen</i>.",1220217834

291530,comment,290969,291019,0,0,dissenter,,,"Writing this I actually had the Nobel prize for Literature in mind, which I feel, along with the Pulitzer, has been largely coopted for political reasons. Were I to suggest to a person of average talent the surest way to a Nobel prize (in other words, how to hack it) I would recommend they take up writing, and especially that sort of writing which is unabashedly anti-establishment.<p>If you were to read through the works of the recipients in the last ten years, you would find the following trend: low quality, combined with the sort of multicultural leanings popular in US academics. This is to simply point out that the prize is no longer rewarding quality work and is instead promoting a political agenda, something that devalues the prize and tarnishes the legacy of past deserving winners. People like Kenzaburo Oe, Dario Fo, and Imre Kertész, while they are respectable writers, fall far short of what I would consider ""outstanding work."" The only conclusion you can draw then is that their awards were based on their political ideology, or the ideology they represent. Kertész's award, for instance, caused a stir, and rightfully so, since his body of work is small and not particularly good, even in the better translations. It is not even particularly notable among its genre, other than for the fact that it has now received a Nobel prize.<p>I was one of the early comments in the thread, and thought the thread might evolve into a discussion on ways to Hack the Nobel, a topic I thought of more lasting interest than a clever way of concealing gold. In terms of work done for effect achieved, it seems much easier to take up writing, or to become a politician and branch over into some tumultuous area, than to devote your life to the quiet pursuit of science, which I feel is much more difficult, less rewarding, and largely responsible for the reputation the lesser Nobels feed off of.<p>I never spent much time thinking about Al Gore's award since to me it indicated an open-and-shut case of bias, typical of the Nobel committee these days, and unworthy of further reflection. I didn't intend to refer to it specifically when I made my initial comment (provoking a reaction from supporters of his ideology), since I could think of many instances to which the comment applied, the recent Peace Prize being just one instance among many.",1220216829

But the learning algorithms created by Ng's team were able to discern the ideal trajectory the pilot was seeking. Thus the autonomous helicopter learned to fly the routine better—and more consistently—than Oku himself.</i><p>This is incredibly cool work -- it's clear how this is a more general approach than hard-coding a bunch of rules about how to fly a particular helicopter, under particular assumptions about the environment and the desired maneuvers.<p>In the future, I wonder if it would be possible to improve the learning algorithms to the point that no human expert is even needed: you could toss the helicopter up in the air, and have it essentially figure out how to fly the machine before it hit the ground.<p>This work is also a nice counterpoint to those who question the value of the work being done in academic computer science. I think there is more innovation and long-term value in these sorts of projects than in a dozen typical Web 2.0 social networking startups.",1220216669

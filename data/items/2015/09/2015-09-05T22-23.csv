Also, rejecting the usefulness of philosophy of science doesn&#x27;t imply accepting the view that <i>the scientific method can and will describe the purposes and meaning behind every phenomena both natural and man-made that have any relevance or importance to our lives as humans</i>.  I think the following is a good summary of Feynman&#x27;s lack of commitment to any philosophical viewpoint[1]:<p><i>I&#x27;m just looking to find out more about the world and if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law which explains everything, so be it, that would be very nice to discover.</i><p><i>If it turns out it&#x27;s like an onion with millions of layers and we&#x27;re just sick and tired of looking at the layers, then that&#x27;s the way it is, but whatever way it comes out its nature is there and she&#x27;s going to come out the way she is, and therefore when we go to investigate it we shouldn&#x27;t predecide what it is we&#x27;re trying to do except to try to find out more about it. If you say your problem is, why do you find out more about it, if you thought you were trying to find out more about it because you&#x27;re going to get an answer to some deep philosophical question, you may be wrong. It may be that you can&#x27;t get an answer to that particular question by finding out more about the character of nature, but I don&#x27;t look at it [like that]. My interest in science is to simply find out about the world, and the more I find out the better it is, like, to find out.</i><p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10176173"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10176173</a>

In reality, they get to formalize it themselves, because the C standards are written in English and contain much ambiguity, and their interpretation evolves over time. Two decades ago, signed arithmetic overflow was described as undefined because everyone “knew” that the authors of the standard wanted to accommodate 1&#x27;s complement and sign-magnitude, and therefore everyone assumed that if you knew your architecture was 2&#x27;s complement, you could expect 2&#x27;s complement behavior.<p>The issue being discussed here is not one of having undefined behavior, though. OpenSSL is being blamed with not satisfying a property that it wasn&#x27;t even documented as having, much less formally specified.<p>Your comparison to aeronautics code is also omitting the price of developing to aeronautics safety standards. For one thing, in aeronautics it is decided in advance what the software will do, and the software is implemented to have only these features. This is not how OpenSSL got to where it is today!<p>Astrée is only used to verify one aspect of the safety of part of the code in the aircraft, so it is really not a good example to use here. If you wanted to make a strong case, you could use miTLS: <a href=""http://www.mitls.org/wsgi/home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mitls.org/wsgi/home</a><p>And since miTLS already exists, you can ask the question of why it is not used in place of OpenSSL.

This verification did not check whether the algebraic properties of any key are correctly validated in any of the cases where this would be relevant, because that&#x27;s outside the perimeter.

Given webapps span the range from &quot;dynamic forms&quot; to browser video games, I can think of no way of implementing the full breadth of what are modern web applications other than essentially video streaming and polling input on the client, which yes, is bandwidth intensive.<p>That&#x27;s the entire reason why js and html and friends have become so popular. You essentially have full applications that have been developed by people who recognize that the bottleneck wrt to a networked application&#x27;s responsiveness is <i>not</i> cpu cycles and memory in 2015 but internet latency. It&#x27;s sufficient here to send a small text file and have the client fill in the gaps and have the client ajax for updates than have the server do the heavy work. I think you argued elsewhere, this is a waste of processor time redundantly rendering content, and thus, a waste of energy needlessly (as in real energy, from electrical into waste heat). As a tree hugger, I have to admit I find that argument somewhat compelling. I think a balance needs to be struck between user experience and use of resources.

Because old code always sucks. But often it&#x27;s not the technology that sucks. It&#x27;s just that code bloats when it gets older. Now when we take CSS away we&#x27;ll do that for 5 years and then we&#x27;ll miss it, so we reintroduce it, maybe using another name, or a competing technology from back then that didn&#x27;t make it. Both will happen, I&#x27;m quite sure of it. Just for you, dear reader, if you want to be the cool guy that knows the technology before the other kids know it, start doing CSS now and wait 5-10 years.

There were broadly similar problems with the WebKit version used by Android, since that was baked into the OS, and vendors are slow to update OSes. Then Google decided that there would be no more independent Android browser, and apps would just reuse the same rendering engine as Chrome -- which could be updated through the Play Store. (Google&#x27;s also been slowly trying to solve other problems related to vendors not updating Android.)<p>But they require some design work. Conservatism with regards to new features is part of it -- while a &quot;normal bug&quot; in functionality only impacts a system where the functionality was intended to be used, a security bug impacts those where it&#x27;s compiled in, even if it&#x27;s unused. Making the kernel more friendly to third-party kernel drivers would allow some of these systems to be upgradeable: Chrome updates in the Play Store don&#x27;t break other applications because there&#x27;s a well-defined ABI to WebView, and that&#x27;s never broken. Designing some functionality (like filesystems) to run in a more microkernel style would make it safer to upgrade targeted parts of the kernel codebase without risking hardware incompatibilities. And so forth.<p>Again, it&#x27;s an engineering tradeoff. Microkernels may be the most hackneyed example of &quot;no, we don&#x27;t want to do it that way&quot;. :)",1441491512

He has written a series of blog posts over the last little while outlining his frustrations. It seems that his last post on the issue led to someone being &quot;100% sure&quot; the Simons foundation would write a cheque. William is demonstrating how very false that is. The assumption is that it should be easy to find a source of funding for such a large and important body of work. But counterintuitively, this has not proved to be the case.",1441491029

Knowledge of basic HTML and CSS is more widespread than you might think.<p>If you&#x27;re using inline styles, you&#x27;re likely to end up with a lot of elements that don&#x27;t have classes or ids to target for styling, so userstylers will have to use complex selectors using :nth-of-type and such, which is harder, more fragile, and not even always possible. And every line of the userstylesheet will need !important annotations, which makes composing multiple userstylesheet on the same page more likely to break.",1441491001

The fact remains that genetic programming is a class of algorithms that has not been succesful in the slightest.

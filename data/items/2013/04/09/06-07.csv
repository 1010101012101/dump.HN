Somewhat? Well, we don't know.<p>The way you determine how meaningful it is, is by connecting the dots with another measure. For example, we have this measure that is cheap to acquire but perhaps inaccurate (Alexa). Can we connect it with another measure that is harder to acquire but more accurate (e.g. exit value)?<p><i>if nothing else, I'd wager it's roughly correlated (on average) with market cap and/or exit price.

But we don't know until you run the numbers.<p>Grounding your measures is what separates cool hacks from data you can actually draw meaningful inferences from.

5516801,comment,5514284,5516638,5,0,Lazare,,,"With all due respect, I think you're wrong.<p>If I'm writing an email in the Gmail app on Android, what I want when I hit send is for the app to save the email locally, and then do its best to try and deliver it.  Ditto for, basically, every other app on the phone that talks to a remote server.  If I try and send a tweet, I want it to go ""sure"", and then be able to go on about my business while it works in the background.  (And, again, that's how the actual twitter app works.)<p>And if I'm using some app that lets me take notes about a meeting or interview and syncs them with the cloud, I sure as HELL want to be able to take those notes <i>and</i> save them locally, even if the cloud sync had to be delayed.  ""Sorry Mr. CEO, but I can't seem to get wifi in this meeting room.  Can we go out on the balcony and you just run back over those last few points?""<p>Now, yeah, I need some way of checking to see if it has actually sent the email or whatever.  And if it fails, a notification that it has done so is not amiss.  Mobile apps, typically, already do this sort of thing.  (For gmail for android, you can check the outbox to look for unsent emails, and I believe twitter for android will notify you if it fails to send a tweet.)<p>To the extent that you're just saying that the app needs to have a UI which doesn't lie or surprise the user, then I agree wholeheartedly.  If the user cares whether or not the cloud has been updated, or the message has actually been sent, don't lie and claim it has when it hasn't!<p>But if you're saying that as a general rule we need to <i>not</i> handle network sync stuff in the background, I think that's nuts.  Nobody wants to sit there with an email draft open hitting send every so often to see if the 3G signal is good enough to talk to the mail server yet.  Nor do we want to save a bunch of emails as drafts when offline, then have to go open each one when we get net access again and send them.  (Come to that, in your model, could we even save an email as a draft in gmail without net access?  Remember, the drafts folder is synced.  Do we want the app to claim that a draft has been saved when it's not accessible from your desktop gmail client?  Isn't that another case of ""pretending we've saved a draft when it's not really saved""?  If not, why not?)<p>TL;DR:  Good UI that doesn't lie to the user is important.  That's not a good reason to cripple your apps functionality so it doesn't do anything you can lie about.",1365490595

It's reliable, confirmed with the VC firms and the startup founders.  Rarely find anything off (crunchbase if way off as all the HN crew already has figured out).<p>Just do a search for VC firms and specify what date YOU want their last investment to be...everyone has different critera.  If you think if it's been more than 6 months it's a ""zombie VC"" (I personally disagree, because without getting technical depends on age of the fund...a new 10-year fund invests most of its money in the first 2 years in a nutshell) then pick 6 months on PrivCo VC firm search for last investment.  If you think it's 12 months search for 12 months.  18 months, search for that.  Don't go by this nonsense list with arbitrary 13 month ""cutoff"", especially when many of these deals aren't announced - so they do have deals as evidenced from fellow HN crew discussion below missing, so the ""no deal in 13 months"" is wrong to begin with - you need a dedicated firm like PrivCo (or DowJones VentureSource) to diligently find those deals day after day.  Just 1 missing VC deal for a firm throws off the entire ""13 month zero deals"" input there = output worthless.<p>Long way of saying search for venture capital firms in my humble opinion using PrivCo and the search criteria: last investment must be within X months, plus must have made investments in the precise sector you want, etc.  Then you get the results, export to Excel, and it even has updated names and direct emails of the partners.

So, I'd like to expand on that line of inquiry:<p>I'd like to think that trying to expose the implementation problems at Heroku would allow for more well informed decision making (e.g. what is the problem, how severe is it, what barriers exist to fix it, how long might it reasonably take to improve things, how can it be mitigated in the meanwhile) rather than being seen as only  apologetics.<p>I realize the point of Heroku is to abstract a lot of detail, but all abstractions are leaky, and it seems like people might want to know more, especially as ongoing experimentation yields information.<p>I don't personally feel an opaque mea culpa is the most useful way to go about this.  Do you disagree?  Is there some other path you would have thought better overall, or in all respects altogether?<p>In general, I compare this to the many support requests I have responded to over time about things Postgres does not do, or could do better, and (very roughly, unless already committed) how likely it would be that they would receive attention in a semi-near-future release.

If you're rewriting it's because you want to make some drastic structural changes and unit tests are just too tightly coupled.

News Corp owns Fox Entertainment Group, which in turn has a number of divisions. The Fox Broadcasting Company is just one of many TV divisions. The ""Broadcasting"" in the name refers the Fox channel broadcast over the airwaves. The cable channels like Fox News, Fx, National Geographic Channel, fox Sports, and so forth, are in separate divisions.<p>Its shows include Family Guy, Hell's Kitchen, Glee, NFL on Fox, etc. Of all the shows appearing on the broadcast channel, I suspect that NFL on Fox could be an issue.

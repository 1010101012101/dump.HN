I work at a large corporation.
I choose who I work with.
I choose my own projects.
I work 40 hours a week for a good salary.
I have good health care (in America).<p>I do have to describe my projects in terms that matter to my corporation, but how is that any different than pitching to VCs?",1215367072

237901,comment,236808,237590,0,0,dmoney,,,"<i>I would argue that, when we talk about ""nature"", we are referring to all that exists</i><p>I would argue that ""nature"" is a matter of perspective.  If the universe is a simulation, for example, the set of things in that simulation and the set of rules that apply to them to us constitute nature.  You could define nature to also include the machine that runs that simulation and the universe in which it exists, but I don't think at that point the term ""nature"" is very useful.  To this outer world, the term ""supernatural"" would apply, relative to the people in the simulation.<p>This outer world would be capable of interfering with the simulation in ways that violate the rules that normally govern it (this was mentioned here[powerpoint]: <a href=""http://www.mit.edu/%7Ehooman/ComputersAndGod.ppt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mit.edu/%7Ehooman/ComputersAndGod.ppt</a>), and those interferences could be called supernatural; or perhaps since they've still occurred inside the simulation, they are ""natural"" but ""paranormal"".  Replace ""simulation"" and ""outer world"" with ""physical world"" and 'spiritual planes' if those terms float your boat.  I'm just playing with semantics here, but so are you:<p><i>God isn't natural, therefor, God doesn't exist.</i><p>This doesn't refute the idea of God, it just shows that some definitions of ""God"" and of ""nature"" are incompatible and may need to be revised.",1215366581

Doing something you don't want isn't any more fun at a startup than elsewhere. It might even be less fun since startups are more intense. You're right that startups don't solve this problem, but they don't cause it either. We cause it ourselves by not doing what we really want to do.<p>I struggle with this myself.<p>""Make something people want"" isn't the axiom to invoke here. ""Do something <i>you</i> want"" is more like it. Gruntwork is inevitable, but when you're doing something that is truly your own thing, it doesn't feel so bad; the connection to what you care about is much closer at hand.",1215365133

I saw a romanticizing of celebrity musicians as cute little kittens, where it went on and on about, &quot;Aww, look how adorably sensitive they are.&quot;<p>For one thing, anyone who trains in music develops a heightened awareness to subtleties in sound. It is not surprising at all for a musician to report an awareness of richness in sound that others don&#x27;t bother with. Just like a carpenter probably would report a deep awareness of grain in wood and how it affects the structural integrity or something similar.<p>Performance art is where people put their emotional extremes on showcase. Obviously the ones with the most extremeness are going to get the most attention from people who want to see that sort of thing. People who are &quot;highly sensitive&quot; are an extreme, and their display of emotions are going to appear more intense, and thus more exciting for performance art consumers.<p>How about doing research on the types of people who would be so obsessive about watching other people&#x27;s pain and joy?

10830585,comment,10826836,10826836,0,0,h2077545,,,"> The effects of World War II were both economic and social. Economically, it decreased variation in income. Like all modern armed forces, America&#x27;s were socialist economically. From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. More or less. Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher ranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they got was fixed according to their rank. And the flattening effect wasn&#x27;t limited to those under arms, because the US economy was conscripted too. Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the National War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to flatness. And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended.

Libertarians are liberals (small &#x27;l&#x27;) and what you call evangelicals are (for the most part) social Burkeans. The U.S. happens to have been founded, for the most part, as a liberal state, so the conservative position and the liberal position have historically been on the same side of most issues: welfare, parental rights, religious freedom, education, economic issues, and so on.<p>There are a <i>few</i> social issues that there isn&#x27;t general agreement on, but those only seem to affect how libertarian voters feel for an election or two. After some statist behavior actually happens (healthcare reform, the Kelo decision, government surveillance, etc.), libertarians start to realize that conservatives align much better with their goals. At least, they&#x27;re the lesser of two evils.<p>I think the problem here is that most people don&#x27;t actually listen to other opinions on things. Since there is a lack of diversity in mainstream opinion shows, certain positions (libertarian, evangelical, etc.) tend to be only described in caricature. When evangelicals and libertarians start to talk about politics, there&#x27;s actually a lot of agreement on big issues. Even when they disagree on the ends, they generally agree on the means (big changes should happen with a Constitutional amendment).",1451829174

The internet has made this kind of self righteous mob effortless, and they feed off each other making justice or the original cause completely secondary to their own need to impose their views.<p>Civilized society depends on the rule of law. There is a large mechanism in place in any civilized society with an extensive process to first decide guilt and then give the guilty an opportunity to pay the price, reform and try again. This by definition rules out arbitrary individual perceptions of justice or injustice, discrimination or organizing to &#x27;directly&#x27; deliver it, to prevent anarchy. Justice by definition cannot empower some arbitrary individuals or groups views over others.<p>Activism targets laws or injustice based on reason and not individuals. The objective is not to shame or deliver consequences for an individual but change the law. Self righteous mobs on the other hand driven by their own opinions and the need to impose their views, rather than justice, target individuals.<p>Discrimination is illegal and has a huge social, personal, and professional consequences. If an individual escapes that somehow it indicates a flaw in the rule of law which activism would target, not the individual. But that&#x27;s not fulfilling for those driven by self importance.<p>You may decide something is wrong but only the rule of law can make that decision objectively and enforce consequences. A mob convinced of its own infallibility sidetracks all that, evades accountability in favour of their own perceptions and in an exercise in pure self importance and injustice delivers consequences. That is little to do with justice and everything to do with vanity, self importance and inability to recognize the limitation of one own views, and the value of activism and rule of law.",1451828716

If you don&#x27;t like power inequality, then you&#x27;re on the left. If you enjoy it or are indifferent to it, then you&#x27;re on the right.<p>So, you not only think that there&#x27;s a universal definition of left vs right in politics but also that it&#x27;s all about one single problem?<p>> On the other hand, supporting flat tax is somewhat alluding to the idea that money do not influence power relationships in society.<p>I don&#x27;t support flat tax, it would be an insane and idiotic idea.<p>I just think it&#x27;s the most fair and just tax scheme. But I don&#x27;t even remotely support it.<p>> So I think the question is, do you believe in that assumption, that income has no influence on political power (and it cannot, for instance, limit personal freedom of other people)?<p>You intertwined a lot of very complicated issues with your comment. First of all:<p>1) Power inequality is not good or bad; it&#x27;s too broad of a definition. In order to attach moral value to it, you have to look at a concrete example in context, not an abstract concept.<p>For example, I think you would prefer for a few of leading climate scientist to have more power over environmental policy than of people who don&#x27;t believe in evolution, right? But this is power inequality, too.<p>2) Taxes are, in theoretically just world, should be a form of payment for government services. Government is an entity that provides us with invaluable services like justice system and other perks, from certification of medication to protection from foreign threats. It&#x27;s good stuff, worth paying for. But in theory, I don&#x27;t see any moral reasons for some people to pay more for these services than others.<p>You, on the other hand, want to use taxes as a tool to solve power inequality, because you decided that it&#x27;s a bad thing. Not only this decision is rather strange (as I already discussed in point 1), but you&#x27;re using a hack to implement a unrelated requirement with the help of a feature that was implemented for completely different reason. Once again, _in theory_ this makes no sense at all.<p>3) And finally, when you involve terms like &quot;personal freedom&quot; into equation, I can almost guarantee that we will end up arguing about what &quot;personal freedom&quot; really is, where it starts and where it ends, and will not able to come to a conclusion.<p>However.<p>You might have guessed that I separate the political theory of what just and what is not from political reality. In political reality that we have, democracy did not appear because of theoretical considerations of what is the best form of government: it evolved as a compromise between different parties who would&#x27;ve otherwise kill each other to determine who&#x27;s right. So were the taxes. And our discussions about what is good and bad, in theory, have very little dent on reality, which is shaped by power struggles of millions of people acting of their self-interest; all we can hope to achieve is to solve these conflicts in the most peaceful way possible. Trying to construct the perfect government system out of theoretical considerations is futile if you&#x27;re lucky, and if you&#x27;re not, you get North Korea or Pol Pot&#x27;s Cambodia.",1451828714

All money earned in a year is one single income. Income from 0 to your providential happiness threshold according to heuristic analysis based off the methodology used in this study: <a href=""https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/deaton_kahneman_high_income_improves_evaluation_August2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/deaton_kahneman_...</a><p>From that point to 100x the happiness threshold you curve progressive taxation from 0% to 90% quadratically, approximating the median around 25% at 50x. Your total tax burden is simply the area under the curve, so rather than having tax brackets you use actual math to make sense and tax progressively all income earned.<p>That means any money made over, if happiness is 75k, 7.5 million is 90% taxed forever. I&#x27;d even wager to make it 100% as a short term measure to help dramatically curb income inequality. Note this rate is actually 2% lower than the highest its ever been, but in practice capping capital gains would have a dramatically larger effect on economic planning.<p>Additionally, you need tariffs on exported wealth, on corporate holdings accounts, and on physical goods hoarded, on property all at progressive rates to avoid off-shore tax evasion, hiding your money in a business account, buying material goods to hide your wealth, and stop the current and tangential issue of land hoarding that would be an even bigger problem under a legitimate tax scheme.<p>Finally, you institute a 10 year wealth tax to try to reclaim some of the amassed ownership of the means of production the ultra-elite have racked up over the last decade and stop some of the rent seeking. It is not just about stopping them from acquiring even more of a share of ownership, its about getting some of it back. The rates here are not something I have researched much, but something of the sort may be required since so much of total wealth has moved to the top.<p>You would keep sales tax as a means to fund local and state government, because while regressive if you try to push progressive taxes locally you will just have regional wealth flight. I strongly disagree with the argument that if you tried realistically taxing the rich to pay for society that they would all flee internationally - because the tax burden is pretty close to this in almost all European countries. Where else are they going? Politically unstable and unsafe third world nations? China? Russia? You would absolutely want some global effort here to prevent there <i>from</i> being such an easy escape route, but its a problem of global scale after all, the asset controllers in the US also dominate international commerce and are as much a problem in their influence on every other nation as they are here.",1451828401

For instance - should we internalize emission externalities by instituting a CO₂ tax? If so, then how high and why? Should we offset increasing automation with basic income or something else? Etc. Labeling it all as &quot;communist&quot; and dismissing it wholesale is about the most idiotic thing a human being can do in a discussion.<p>Secondly, they promote this lunacy in thinking.

10830484,comment,10827588,10827588,0,0,ricksplat,,,"I&#x27;ve seen Paul Graham make a few shocking remarks about wealth distribution claiming for instance there&#x27;d be no Sergey and Larry (i.e. Google) if they thought some of their wealth was given to the poor. I doubt Sergey and Larry would have been one bit perturbed if they thought they would have amassed 80% of or even less. In their wildest dreams they could probably not have even imagined amassing 20% of that. But I don&#x27;t want to get bogged down talking about their outlying data point - though Mr Graham chose to present it as exemplar.<p>My main objection to Mr Graham (apart from his general &quot;let them eat LISP&quot; tone) is that his point is moot in the larger context. Yes it is true that the technology sectors have been phenomenally successful in the last few years but they are such a tiny amount of the actual working economy. They only stand out because they are still in growth while the vast bulk of the economy is not.<p>Mr Graham quite grandiosely describes himself as a &quot;creator of inequality&quot; as though he is somehow on a par with these captains of industry, the 1% or economic elite as we variously describe them but he is not. He&#x27;s just another cog in the system - a well remunerated cog certainly but a cog nonetheless.<p>As a programmer myself I enjoy an elevated income and standard of living. Having worked in a few startups I have rubbed shoulder regularly with a few millionaires (self-made and otherwise) and by and large I would describe these guys as often friendly, often generous, and always fiendishly clever and hard working. I&#x27;ve never envied them their gains and I&#x27;ve never wanted for more - I&#x27;m doing a job I love and I have enough money to live in comfort and can buy most things I need without having to struggle.<p>But we are in a different world my millionaire friends and I. In the various other walks of life I encounter I see people working harder than me, more qualified than I, and enjoying far less job security than me, and all simply because they work in &quot;low growth&quot; sectors of the economy. Sectors that are nonetheless necessary, such as health, with skills that are nonetheless indispensable (nurses, firemen) yet woefully under resourced. All because they aren&#x27;t growth industries - which can basically be reinterpreted as &quot;there isn&#x27;t a quick buck to be made&quot;.<p>On the flip side to that Mr Graham talks about how the successful businesses are those that have increased productivity by harnessing technology to increase efficiency and productivity but if that is the general trend, that the economy is nurturing more efficient use of resources then why isn&#x27;t the cost of living going down?<p>The truth of it is that Mr Graham and I are enjoying relatively sweet times because we are the darlings of capital. We give better returns on investment than other sectors of the economy. We find new ways to do things so that the cost of running businesses is decreased whilst still charging the same price for the services to the consumer.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t be so quick to set ourselves at odds with the egalitarian movement. Certainly I wouldn&#x27;t rush to pay more tax or earn a lesser wage - but at the same time it does hurt me to see the numbers of homeless increasing, my friends and family struggling, and the quality of medical care in decline. I&#x27;d have to weigh these factors up before taking flight with my valuable skillset.<p>But what I do wonder about, is about these shadowy figures in the background that always seem to be taking a cut. I mean the actors and organisations that fund and manipulate all of this - that nurture &quot;high growth&quot; systems and starve the &quot;low growth&quot; ones - whether it&#x27;s on purpose, or just an emergent pattern - and what are we going to do about it?<p>I believe in Capitalism, and I accept that inequality is a natural factor of society. But that shouldn&#x27;t preclude me from saying that we need more socialism in our society - that doesn&#x27;t mean I want a centrally planned communist state like the USSR, it just means that I want our valuations to be more nuanced than just &quot;return on investment&quot;.<p>Somebody somewhere else on here wrote that if you increased taxes on the wealthy it would only amount to a few thousand dollars extra per person. Well I can only say that is a <i>lot</i> of money to somebody that doesn&#x27;t have a thousand dollars and collectively it is a <i>lot</i> of money for an institution such as a hospital.<p>I believe the phrase these days is that you should &quot;check your privilege&quot;.",1451827211

They live together and seem mostly happy. And I am happy for them, except for one thing: I am about 99 percent sure he is gay. Now, I have no problem with homosexuality, but you can understand my concern. Also, I am not the only one who thinks this. Several male friends have told me that he has tried to kiss other men or grab their crotches. I would like to bring this up with my sister. How should I do it?<p>Michelle, New York&quot;<p>The response:<p>&quot;Request denied! Before you say anything hurtful to your sister, let’s take a peek at some of the (homophobic-adjacent) assumptions that you’ve made on your (probably well-intentioned) road to judgment. Your 99 percent certainty rests on unknown evidence. (Spare me your gaydar.) But I am willing to bet that much of it involves silly stereotypes about masculinity. Is the boyfriend effeminate? Does he follow fashion or musical theater? News flash: He can still be straight.&quot;<p>&quot;More problematic is the “gay panic” of your male friends, whose gossipy stories may rely on secondhand reports from still other men. Not so reliable. What’s more, I don’t buy it. Gay men and lesbians have long been, and often still are, a persecuted minority. (Have you seen the excellent film “Carol” yet?)

Let me explain.<p>I think left vs right means how much you care about people when it comes to their relative power and social status in society. If you don&#x27;t like power inequality, then you&#x27;re on the left. If you enjoy it or are indifferent to it, then you&#x27;re on the right.<p>Now democracy is a distinctly leftist concept, because it explicitly gives everybody the same political power. Gay rights, well, it&#x27;s a little aside from this classification but basically equal rights for everybody is in the same ballpark (that&#x27;s why most equal rights movements are considered leftist).<p>On the other hand, supporting flat tax is somewhat alluding to the idea that money do not influence power relationships in society. Which is AFAICT empirically false. I do however think that you can recognize flat tax as being just under that assumption.<p>You do seem to care about distribution of power in society, which makes you leftist. So I think the question is, do you believe in that assumption, that income has no influence on political power (and it cannot, for instance, limit personal freedom of other people)?",1451826286

Such a protest could have been conducted in such a way that united all people in protest against the injustice.  Instead, thanks to the mob instinct, the killing was used to justify indiscriminate violence, theft and destruction. Thus the real issue - the killing of the young man - was diminished in importance thanks to the mob behaviour, and the opportunity for that incident to be a catalyst for real social change was lost.",1451826252

Having no control over what remains will make you effectively hired managers working for 10% of profit each, so after that, what kind of salary they are willing to pay you will be your biggest concern. Making something which is easy to replicate doesn&#x27;t put you in a good negotiation position for sure, so maybe just take this cash, then walk away, and use the money to fund yourselves for a couple more years to build something that isn&#x27;t that easy to copy.",1451826204

The notion that this is some sort of social cancer strikes me as completely out of touch with reality.<p>I&#x27;ve seen maybe a handful of failed attempts to allow students to opt out of university course curricula. Is that what you are so horrified about? Or is it the mostly failed attempts to get people fired for saying things that some people found abhorrent?<p>I&#x27;ve yet to see anyone imprisoned for their speech by SJWs. Frankly, the anti-SJW stance reads to me as quite ironic: people horrified that someone they disagree with might be allowed to have a voice on the national stage. I thought the whole point of free speech was that people get to voice ideas you find abhorrent?<p>What&#x27;s really frightening is how often posts like yours, which are completely devoid of specifics, get voted up. It&#x27;s like a frenzy of anger that rises to the top of these kinds of threads, totally detached from any history. I&#x27;m assuming there is some history behind your post, but you didn&#x27;t reference it. Someone like Salmon Rushdie stands up and says he&#x27;s terrified of the witch hunts, without providing any specifics, and it makes national news with thousands of people chiming in about how scared they are too. But scared of what, exactly? People rarely say. &quot;SJWs&quot;.<p>The South Park episode is beloved because it&#x27;s all straw men. If you had to reference real events, it would become clear that it&#x27;s mostly straw feminists and students who actually didn&#x27;t cause any particular reign of terror. As if wild-eyed college students haven&#x27;t been making accusations that are beyond the pale for... well, forever.<p>That said, maybe I&#x27;m out of touch with the news and there are some events I missed. I would love to learn of such events, because it would make this debate much more interesting. As it is I find it kind of frightening how much anger seems to be building up around what appears to be a fabricated danger.",1451826064

Income inequality is expanding because those at the very top either pay taxes much lower than all others (HF, PE, VC) or just don&#x27;t pay taxes at all (AAPL).<p>The other problem with income inequality is simply interest rate related.  If you look at all asset classes over the last 30 years, real estate gains have far outpaces every other asset class.  Real estate prices are very sensitive to interest rates.<p>If the Fed keeps raising rates, the value of these real estate holdings will go down and well inequality will reverse itself somewhat.  To do that significantly, I think we need Fed Funds at 5-6%.  I don&#x27;t see that happening for a long time, though.<p>Another longer term trend which may help wealth inequality reverse itself is global warming.  The global elite own a disproportionate portion of coastal real estate.  With rising ocean levels these assets will be wiped out.",1451826048

  Severity: Low

  An OpenSSL client will accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-
  export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. A server could present a weak
  temporary key and downgrade the security of the session.

  This issue affects all current OpenSSL versions: 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8.

  OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1k.
  OpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0p.
  OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zd.

  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd October 2014 by Karthikeyan
  Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA. The fix was developed by Stephen
  Henson of the OpenSSL core team.

Not saying he doesn&#x27;t know UX but it isn&#x27;t his primary mode of operation. Or they simply didn&#x27;t have time to do a circular UI.<p>I&#x27;m a big believer that the best smart watches will be round. A circle is more aesthetically pleasing than a rectangle. More importantly it has better ergonomics and you could do things like rotate the watch face according to hand position.<p>Lots of content looks really well when encapsulated by a circle since it looks more &quot;organic&quot;. Photos, faces, maps, time. It&#x27;s a little bit worse for chunks of text however but most snippets displayed like a SMS should be pretty short.<p>There&#x27;s also a huge opportunity to use a rotatable bezel as tactile complement to a touch screen, making zooming, and scrolling easier. Being excellent for things like &quot;dial selectors&quot; and preventing smudges and being all around easier to find, grip and manipulate than the screen or a crown. Having invented the scroll wheel for the iPod for nearly the exact same reasons one would think Apple would be wise to this fact.<p>So what about the claim that it should be rectangle because &quot;a huge function is lists&quot;. I think this simple is lack of imagination on the UX part. You have to think of the main purposes for a watch, as a complement but not replacement for a phone.<p>I actually don&#x27;t see many scenarios where you&#x27;d want to browse through large lists or wall of texts on your watch.

It seems plausible that this data could encapsulate said years of experience. What is missing is that ability to create a computer than can process said data and create consciousness with it.<p>Sure in the first truly AI-capable systems it will most likely be easier training them over the years in human-time, but it seems to me very unlikely to be needed when AI becomes established and at that point you should be able to create X copies of intelligence(s) at will.<p>And for all this talk about AI terminator doomsdays, these seems to be much less talk about what can be accomplished with it.<p>Let&#x27;s say you create AI system, it lives in a air-gapped system, the system is carefully crafted to establish reality for the AI(s) that exists solely in the virtual world. Then you create a scientist AI, mathematician AI, engineer AI, etc. Then you have a hard problem you want to solve, great, spin up 1000 scientist AI&#x27;s, 10000 engineer AI&#x27;s, X project coordinator AI&#x27;s, etc. Let&#x27;s just say they have roughly the same capabilities as their human counterparts and work at similar speed, but do not sleep, grow tired, form unions, nor do anything other than work on the task assigned. Create a system (API?) that allows them to somehow interact with our physical reality but without understanding it whatsoever to allow them to do experiments and test results. How long would it take for such a system to recreate all of google&#x27;s infrastructure, or develop the next space shuttle, or cure cancer?<p>I think it&#x27;s important to note the a true AI(however you define it) does <i></i>not<i></i> have to be self aware. It doesn&#x27;t even have to be aware of our physical reality. Once we reach the point where we understand consciousness well enough to recreate it, it seems likely that will be able to tune it however which way we&#x27;d like: remove self-consciousness making it act on more what we would consider instinct, configure it&#x27;s reward pathways in whatever way the directs the agent to whatever task the AI designer wishes and yes, even improve it. It will be very interesting when the system spins on not 1 average human level engineer but something like a Einstein-Newton hybrid that works several orders of magnitude faster than human time. I would guess the danger there would be less from the AI(as you could isolate it from our physical reality by isolating in a virtual world) and more the extremely advanced knowledge/technology gained from such a system.",1425429529

Given enough time researchers do pretty well at creating &quot;intelligent&quot; machines, but these are all focused on very specific, narrow problems. For example, we can classify tweet sentiment pretty well, but we can&#x27;t summarize documents yet.<p>The reason that the general cases become more difficult is because success is less well defined and the number of possibilities is usually bigger. For example with tweet sentiment there aren&#x27;t that many possibly results (in the simplest case it&#x27;s just binary: positive or negative). But say you want to summarize a document, well that&#x27;s much harder, since how do you even know when a document is well summarized? And assuming you can know when a document is well summarized, how do you get enough data to train your model on?<p>But even the more general case of summarizing documents is still pretty narrow. It&#x27;s just dealing with text. Now what if you want your document summarizing robot to learn when to drive your car to pick you up from you doctors appointment. Well now your robot needs to know about your schedule, it needs to know about cars, it needs to know about traffic laws, and so on.<p>So the more you generalize the more data your machine learning algorithm needs to know to draw the proper conclusions. And that data either needs to be hard coded into it or otherwise fed into it so that it can learn. If it&#x27;s hard coded then you have a labor problem, since it takes lots of time for someone to write all the things we take for granted into a way that a machine can understand and if you try to get it to learn it then you have the problem of needing to specify what a good and bad outcome is like we did above with document classification.<p>So the reason I don&#x27;t think scaling up is possible is because we don&#x27;t have good ways to measure what a good outcome looks like.<p>I don&#x27;t expect a breakthrough to come, rather, I see steady progress as the norm, but I think what can improve the capabilities of current AI and ML techniques is to find some way of baking in basic facts and logic into our programs. For example, you were born with the ability to recognize when someone is angry with you or glad to see you and how to reason spatially, etc. If we can do something analogous with machines then I think that would be a big improvement. But again, it&#x27;s really hard to say how to do this, since if we hard code it we have problems and if we try to learn it we also have problems, as I noted earlier.",1425427867

I will grant you that terser languages tend to lend themselves better to REPL than the more verbose languges, but REPL doesn&#x27;t require a syntax optimised for one liners - and nor are any language REPLs designed purely for one liners.<p>> &quot;Where is the GUI equivalent of ncurses, both in simplicity and lightweightness?&quot;<p>ncurses <i>is</i> the GUI equivalent.

The only benefit your solutions offer over the examples I&#x27;d given was that you can prove that these things can be done outside of the command line - which was never in question to begin with. However you&#x27;ve not addressed my points about the simplicity of these terminal-based applications.

Both repos are on the same internal repo server. Both repos are accessible to multiple persons - some can access the code only (developers) and some can access the configuration repo only and some can access both repos (admin). A build process tags both repositories and builds an artifact that gets deployed.<p>How is that situation superior in terms of security over:<p>Code and configuration live side by side in the same repository that supports access controls. The repository is hosted on an internal repo server. The parts that are code are accessible to developers only and admins can access both parts. A build process tags the repository and builds an artifact that gets deployed.<p>The only point I could see is that with two repositories it&#x27;s harder to mess up the authentication, but I doubt that&#x27;s true. In both scenarios we have people with access to the configuration and those people will in a lot of organization have a copy on their laptop that they carry around. That&#x27;s how most people use version control. In both setups it would be possible to only ever handle the sensitive data on a remote system, but that&#x27;s a property of the workflow and not a property of the VCS used. I seriously don&#x27;t see the issue with a shared repo - if it supports access controls.",1425427604

Bit shift is not part of the IntegerType protocol, when it should be (although the author could avoid the issue by accumulating the bytes in a UIntMax instead of the generic type).<p>2. Construction from (and conversion to) a UIntMax bit pattern is not part of the IntegerType protocol, when it should be (done correctly, this addresses the author&#x27;s sign <i>and</i> construction complaints)<p>The author incorrectly claims/implies that these are problems with generics or protocols or the diversity of integer types in Swift. They&#x27;re really a problem of omissions in the standard library protocols that are forcing some very cumbersome workarounds. The necessary functionality exists, it just isn&#x27;t part of the relevant protocols. Submit these as bugs to Apple.<p>Edit:<p>As a follow up, here&#x27;s a version that gets around the standard library limitations using an unsafe pointer...<p><pre><code>  func integerWithBytes<T: IntegerType>(bytes:[UInt8]) -> T? {
    if (bytes.count < sizeof(T)) {
        return nil
    }
    var i:UIntMax = 0

The libraries aren&#x27;t there yet.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to write a program that uses RSS feeds. There&#x27;s no RSS feed reader library, so I have to write that.  RSS requires an XML parsing library, an HTTP library, and an ISO date parser.  There are several choices for an XML parsing library, and one of them worked and produced a good tree.  It doesn&#x27;t have any functions for finding elements in the tree, though, so I had to write those.<p>There are at least three HTTP libraries. One is obsolete, one isn&#x27;t done yet, and one, &quot;hyper&quot; is usable.  Or it was, until last week, when the &quot;io&quot; library had a major redesign.  Using &quot;old_io&quot;? That&#x27;s so last week. Right now, the &quot;hyper&quot; HTTP library is broken, due to some upstream problems with the SSL and cookie libraries being broken by the change at the &quot;io&quot; level.  The appropriate issue tickets have been opened and many people are working hard on fixing everything that does I/O to do it the new way.<p>ISO date parsing wasn&#x27;t implemented for the date/time module, so I wrote that, forked the date/time module, and submitted a pull request. The author of the date/time library rewrote the code and added it, and now the stock &quot;chrono&quot; module does the date/time formats needed for RSS and Atom feeds.<p>Compiling my own code, I now get messages like<p><pre><code>    rssread.rs:262:23: 262:25 warning: obsolete syntax: []
    rssread.rs:262     p.feed_str(&string[]);

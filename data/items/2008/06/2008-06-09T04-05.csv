212525,comment,212479,212479,0,0,andreyf,,,"This is definitely a time to put everything on hold and think about life for a bit.<p>School, jobs, and startup can wait - talk to a dean about your finals, you can take them at the end of the summer. As far as jobs, write ""Expected graduation: Summer 2008"", on your resume and get a letter from your school explaining there are extraordinary circumstances that prevented you from taking your finals.<p>Spend time in places without distractions (mountain, park, beach?) and let your mind wander for awhile - think about life, about what your roommate's passing means in respect to your life. When you feel ready to get back, you'll be more focused than before.<p>Death of a close one is always a sobering experience - take some time to take it in fully before getting on with things.<p>All the best, practically and emotionally,

I usually eat toast with peanut butter and honey or jam, a bit of fruit, and whatever else looks tasty.  I always have a hard time understanding how people don't eat breakfast because I wake up sooooo hungry.  I'm totally worthless if I don't eat breakfast.",1212986161

212517,comment,212479,212479,0,0,gizmo,,,"Try a change of scenery, avoid doing things and places that remind you of your roommate. Try to study at a different location, maybe the library or a starbucks. Find a different place to sleep too, crash at friends maybe. Don't mourn or even think about what happened until you've hit your milestones. Thinking even a little will open a flood of emotions. Play a game or something (flash game / mine sweeper / super mario) whenever you need to take a break or when you lose focus, but don't let your brain go idle. Get more sleep deprived than usual, so your brain will be a bit less reflective and you will fall asleep quicker too. Oh, and try to completely avoid news sites and all that stuff.<p>At least, this is how I handled it when I didn't have time to mourn. Your milage may vary. My condolences and I hope you'll make it through this period.",1212985779

212515,comment,212479,212479,0,0,jfoutz,,,"So, a long time ago, my best friend died. It was really hard. I didn't eat or talk much. I still go to his grave from time to time. It was a fundamental change in my life.<p>Take the time you need. A week of renting old movies or playing video games is a tiny tiny risk to both your degree and your startup.<p>I'm not sure what's best for you, but for me, i had to take time to figure out what it meant that my friend was never coming back. It's hard. Once I came to grips with that i thought a lot about what really matters.<p>If it was me, I'd not work on the startup, and just doing enough school to keep up for a day or three... Spend time thinking through exactly why I was in school, and why i'm doing a startup. But again, do what's best for you. Maybe work is just the thing to keep your mind off how tough something like this is.<p>Call your parents. Talking to my dad was a lot better than my mom.<p>If you feel like i think you feel, these words won't really mean any thing, but you have my deepest sympathy. It gets easier... but there are always tough days.",1212985692
212514,comment,212479,212479,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"My condolences. That must be very, very tough.<p>Many colleges have counseling services and I'd advise you to seek them out ASAP. They can help you. Among the <i>least</i> important of the things they can do is help you try and get some extensions on your finals so that you don't have to concentrate on some stupid book less than a week after this terrible shock.<p>If your college can't help I'd still advise you to see a counselor. As someone who is married to a counselor, I assure you that they have skills that I will never match, especially over the freaking <i>Internet</i>. I do love the web, but sometimes it really is a lousy substitute for a face-to-face conversation with a human being.<p>I will confine myself to this advice: Your finals are unimportant, and your ""milestones"" an order of magnitude less important than that. Your well-being is important. Give yourself permission to mourn. You need to do it -- <i>everyone</i> needs to do it -- and it's unreasonable to expect it to be <i>possible</i> to shunt it off to the side and focus on work. And, in general, the people around you will understand this. The world will not come to an end if you take some time for yourself.<p>[Composed before I read kyro's post, which is precisely on point.]",1212985652

Luckily for me, she was not only my friend but very well known throughout our community and we all came together to mourn our loss AND celebrate her great accomplishments.  I still think about her often and hope to live by the goodness she represented.  I've gotten to think of the entire event as a blessing in disguise, as our loss has now brought us together and caused us to reevaluate our goals, principles and lifestyles.<p>My sincerest, heartfelt condolences to you for your loss.  Spend time with those who are close to you and remember him, what he stood for, his impact on you and what you can do to better yourself.  I know it must be very hard now but just know that in time, it will pass.  Life will move on and it is our responsibility to remember those lost and live our lives the best we can.  Surround yourself with your loved ones in tough times, that is probably the best advice I can give.  Good luck on finals.",1212985257

212505,comment,212479,212479,0,0,kyro,,,"I'd hate to give you advice that I know won't work, because I've received the same in the past. I can only tell you what I've learned from my experience.<p>Last year, as finals were approaching, I would drive up north every weekend to see my grandpa in the hospital. He was suffering from a bad case of kidney failure. It was an immensely stressful time of my life, ultimately ending in him passing away the weekend before finals. We were extremely close. After hearing the news, attending the funeral, etc., I realized I hadn't cried much, and thought that was weird. I was bottling up my emotions thinking that is was the 'manly' way of coping. What happened was that I had bottled up so much emotion, that the bottle couldn't contain any more, and every so often the bottle started to leak emotions, and I found myself in periodic ruts of depression. So the lesson for me was to just mourn.<p>So, just mourn. Of course, realize that you have responsibilities and goals that need attention, but if taking time off will help you cope, then so be it. Face the situation and don't try to run around it, because it will catch up with you.<p>My condolences.",1212984653

212502,comment,212218,212494,0,0,psyklic,,,"Actually, the complexity of synaptic structure between species is not obvious (and hence, this is one reason the article made it into Nature Neuroscience, a highly regarded journal). Since the neuron is the fundamental unit of the nervous system in all species, it is a decent prediction that it is of the same ""complexity"" across all species.<p>I do agree that articles should be published in open-access journals. However, most people here probably could not understand the article well (no offense to HN readers!).<p>You really do need a very good biology background to even understand the experiments or to interpret the conclusions and their reliability. In addition, scientific articles are very dry, and if a journalist did not simplify it for you, you likely (1) would have missed the big ideas (which are often phrased in scientific jargon), and most importantly, (2) would have never read the article in the first place!",1212984324

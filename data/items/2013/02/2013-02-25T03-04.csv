5277249,comment,5276892,5276892,6,0,ppierald,,,"I would recommend against using sudo su -, esp if you have <user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL or such constructs in your /etc/sudoers file that exempt password requirements from executing sudo commands.<p>1. su gives you a root shell. Principle of least privilege dictates you should executes the fewest commands as root as required, not all commands as root because you need one.<p>2. sudo su - loses auditability of who executed what/when. All we know is that someone got a sudo shell at some point. When the forensics guys come along post-breach, you won't have a lot of good info to give them.<p>3. Loss of a shell (via command injection on a web form) may allow remote Command-and-Control of your machine.<p>If you need a cron or other headless process (daemons, etc.) then use NOPASSWD in conjunction with a whitelisted set of commands (not /bin/bash) to be executed.<p>If you need an operator to execute a command as a specific user, then use sudo -u <user> <cmd>. Even if you allow ALL commands, at least your audit logs will know what/when the command was executed.<p>With all powerful commands comes the responsibility of understanding how to use them safely and what the possible repercussions are.",1361764775

I've spent years working totally in an office, totally at home, and various combinations of the two.<p>I get a lot less done in the office precisely because I can't concentrate with people moving and talking all around me. Just the thought of the open floorplan setups a lot of companies have makes me shudder. Putting headphones on and listening to music is just as distracting to me.<p>Working from home, it's quiet and I can focus on what I need to. I don't have any issue with lack of social contact; between IMs, telephone, Skype, and the occasional trip to the office it just never seems to be an issue.<p>Overall, I think the best setup (for me) is being able to work from home as often as I want (2-4 days a week), with the opportunity to go into an office whenever I want for meetings and general discussion.",1361764264

In the immediate short term nothing would happen but within a year there would be widescale protests through out KSA as public sector employs realise they have no equity what so ever.<p>Outside of the gulf, North African countries would undergo massive social upheaval as the ruling elite and powerclass fled and left behind those who are unforunate enough to not be able to escape. The Levant would be sheltered primarily due to their lack of reliance on petrochemical dollars though Syria would degenerate.<p>Iran would diversify and overcome the situation. They've been under embargo one way or another for nearly 30 years so they have experience in maintaing the necessary cash flow to pay their citizens and avoid major economic collapse.<p>In the medium term you would see the complete collapse within the gulf of the ruling class. The royal families would flee and take as much money as they could while their underlings would be handed the reigns. They would fail and social anarchy would take over before the common people reverted back to Islamic governance. For a generation at least you would see fundamentalist Islamic theocracies pop up as people vied for power but no real governing institution would rule.<p>Now that we're looking so far into the crystal ball things could go either way but there is a possibility that the Arabs would return to a Kilafa style of governance which would actually reunite the Arab World, see human rights (at least an Islamic interpretation of it) flourish, education take off, economic and social reform at a level never thought possible etc etc.<p>But really, at the end of the day shutting the oil off will probably only have minor consquences.

If you're using TWC's local resolver, try 8.8.8.8 (run by Google); if you're using Google's already try the local resolver and/or OpenDNS (208.67.222.222).<p>If that does work as well, I'd recommend it over the heavy-handed approach of blocking arbitrary netblocks.

A startup is a monumental commitment and it's a good thing your partner realized their heart wasn't in it before things got more serious (ie; product launch).<p>As for where to go from here, it depends a lot on the state of the current project IMO. If it's <i>possible</i> to get something out the door with the backend as it is now, I'd say do that. Call it an MVP, and see how it goes. If it turns out you're on to something, you can start looking for others to join you and use your traction as an argument. 
If it just absolutely doesn't work as-is, and you really believe in this, you should probably do what it takes to get an MVP out the door.

""jonkx using  on  | May 31, 2010 at 10:22 am | Permalink<p>I worked with the Unix OS from the early 1980s (at first we ran early versions on a DEC PDP-11) until 1992. Starting in 1992, I did contract work on proprietary versions based on SVR4.<p>It was just easier to say the initials S U or super-user than to say switch user or substitute user. To insist on correctness, whether authoritarian, historical or otherwise seems petty.<p>Depending on the options used, su can be used to switch user, substitute user or become super user. Success depends on knowledge of the appropriate password. sudo on the other hand may allow one to become any other user (depending on the configuration of sudo and being a sodoer) knowing only the login password.<p>On the systems I have used, a sudoer can become root (super user) using this shell command at a terminal:<p>sudo su  root<p>and responding to the prompt with the login password used to sign in the current user.<p>I think it is important to point out that you cannot become super user or root from a shell with the su command alone unless there is a root password and that password is entered at the prompt.

I was hoping that soon we'd hook backend / frontend and launch. However, he has just quit.<p>He has seemed busy and I suppose I wasn't entirely surprised when he told me that he wasn't spending as much time as he would have liked or as the startup deserved. He said he'd be able to work on things for the next few weeks and help to transition things to me. He felt bad and didn't want any compensation for his work.<p>While I couldn't ask for him to leave in a better way, I'd be lying if I didn't say I wish he would stick around.<p>At the same time, the idea and startup passion was always mine.

Some of the author's other points are valid, and DF definitely has some (just some!?) problems with the UI (my personal nitpick is that there are multiple ways to draw rectangles) but I get the impression that she set things up planning to fail. Not R-ingTFM isn't really a reasonable way to review this game. DF doesn't have a team of people behind it, and there's no UX designer to figure out how to make things beautiful and intuitive. On the other hand, the game is <i>free</i>, and the developers have supposedly turned down at least one relatively large buyout offer in order to keep working on their dream on their own terms.<p>It's cliche, but you get out of DF what you put into it.

Axe all caffeine, then you feel like you can't concentrate, etc.<p>* Attention issues- whether you've got ADD, ADHD, other executive processing or other processing issues, it really sucks. If you feel like you're doing all you can, you can try to just write down the items you need to do that are immediate vs. not, you can add sites you need to ignore to /etc/hosts to point at localhost, etc. but if you have some of these issues, you just aren't going to do what others do. Just switching jobs may put you into an even worse position.<p>* Past history- some people have really awful family situations. Unfortunately when you grow up in a toxic environment, you may have to work 1000x times harder and may just have to accept that you'll always have that pain and just have to manage it.<p>So, WTF are you supposed to do? Don't give up. Do try to work on the issues, and looking for another job is good. Try to fix the health stuff. Do what you can to enforce healthy behavior, but don't do diets- you will lose weight maybe even for months, and then you'll be even more overweight. Find some way to exercise that you like and doesn't make you uncomfortable. Hang out with friends and do things that you enjoy, and if you can, try to get better at them. No matter what it is, there is a chance you could make a business out of it, or at least a fun hobby. Just don't hurt yourself or anyone else doing it.<p>Anyway- I still dislike what I do.

276777,comment,276249,276382,0,0,stcredzero,,,"I've worked on a large client/server property/casualty insurance application written in C.  I've also written programs and middleware in C++, Java, Perl, and Smalltalk.<p>C is great for getting the CPU to do something at a somewhat low level, but still having some ability to abstract.  If you want lots of abstraction my experience is that C++, Java, and Smalltalk are much better choices.  Of those, C++ gives you the most leeway for getting yourself into deep trouble that's hard to debug.  Smalltalk allows you to blow up or lock up the world with one errant statement, but messing with those parts of the library is rare, and you can get everything back anyhow because your source code and every change to the image is kept in something like a transaction log.  Java gives you a lot of the benefits of Smalltalk, but saddles you with a syntax that was designed to allow low level programming with somewhat high level abstraction, even though you aren't doing the former and want the latter in spades.",1218776142

In a world where kids have so many distractions and a computer is not novel and exciting (like the Commodore was), you need to keep their attention by keeping them engaged somehow.",1218775356
276765,comment,276213,276213,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Many have feared recently that smaller game developers would be pushed out of the business; clearly, with better and better graphics expected out of games and development costs shooting through the roof, they wouldn't have a chance, would they?<p>But the irony of it all is that the exact opposite seems to be happening: sick of complicated, high-budget, high-price yet often low-quality games, gamers are looking for simpler but more innovative and interesting games to hold their attention.<p>This is even happening in the non-indie scene; look how wildly popular Portal was, despite the fact that it was a 5-hour $20 game made by the small team behind Narbacular Drop, with some extra resources from Valve.  If anything, its release far overshadowed the higher-profile and higher-budget Half-Life Episode 2.<p>Of course, the biggest chance for indie developers to make their debut is in genres that are classically inexpensive to develop games for: strategy games, adventure games, old-fashioned RPGs, shooters, etc.  One example of this is the wildly popular (at least in Japan) Touhou shmup series; a total of 7 PC shooter games (plus the 5 older PC-98 games) all made by a <i>single developer, despite the fact that he has a day job, too</i>.  The games are so successful that there's an entire convention each year dedicated solely to products related to his games--and yet despite the success, the only ones involved in production are that single developer and his many, many beers.<p>Xbox Live Arcade is a perfect ground for promoting such games; if you put a low-priced game that looks interesting in front of the eyes of tens of millions of people with points to spend, you're sure to get loads of sales.",1218775025

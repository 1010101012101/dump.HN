5389912,comment,5388821,5388821,1,0,itsprofitbaron,,,"I think it will eventually happen but for now there are still issues to overcome. For instance SSL-encrypted HTTP traffic requires more resources (mainly CPU and memory) on servers, than unencrypted HTTP. Although when Google moved to SSL [1], Adam Langley (a Google engineer) said[2]<p><pre><code>  all of our users use HTTPS to secure their email between their browsers and Google, all the time. In order to do this we had to deploy no additional machines and no special hardware. On our production frontend machines, SSL/TLS accounts for less than 1% of the CPU load, less than 10KB of memory per connection and less than 2% of network overhead. Many people believe that SSL takes a lot of CPU time and we hope the above numbers (public for the first time) will help to dispel that.
</code></pre>
So whilst SSL/HTTPS doesnt require a significant amount of additional server resources SSL still introduces some latency in particular during the Secure Sockets Layer Handshake phase[3] and it still requires more memory. Although once the SSL Handshake is done, then latency is reduced slightly and you can also solve some of these issues by caching a lot of HTTPs requests and as Google have done, you can also solve the issue with higher memory usage by patching OpenSSL to reduce the memory allocated to each connection[2]:<p><pre><code>  OpenSSL tends to allocate about 50KB of memory for each connection. We have patched OpenSSL to reduce this to about 5KB and the Tor project have independently written a similar patch that is now upstream.
</code></pre>
This leads nicely onto the issue of caching because, in the context of SSL encryption, browsers handle this differently and whilst some allow caching of SSL content, other browsers dont or they only allow temporary caching in memory only which means that, the next time a user visits they have to download the same content, even if it hasnt changed which affects website performance.<p>Likewise, theres also the issue of cookies  and you may think Im using SSL, everything is fine actually it isnt. If you are using SSL by default but the website still allows requests with unencrypted HTTP then it is still possible to steal cookies containing authentication tokens / session ids by issuing an unencrypted request towards the target website.  This is a simple fix though  you can either flag the cookies as secure or you can make sure the web server hosting the web application enforces SSL.<p>However, they arent the only reasons as to why, as many websites are using CDNs to reduce load on their servers and to improve performance for their users depending on their geographical location. Thus this reduces latency and helps improve the overall performance of the site for their users.  
Now this is all good but, CDNs are use for static content  content which doesnt carry any sensitive information and doesnt require server side processing. You can say that you could at the same time mix, SSL-encrypted information via HTTPS and serve the static content via HTTP for the same website but because of the way SSL is implemented in browsers, if a page uses SSL and includes content from normal HTTP  it shows the user a warning and for non-technical users (the ones with 100 toolbars) this may scare them to leave the website.<p>As a result, if you want to use SSL on your website, you need all the static content on your website to be served with the same SSL encryption which is a waste of resources.  Likewise, SSL requires a certificate for each of the hostnames used to serve static content so if hostnames for the static content are being served by a CDN and are configured as CNAME records which are pointing directly to the CDN's server, requests for that static content will obviously go straight to the CDN servers rather meaning that those certificates must also be installed on the CDN servers for the CDN to serve the static content under those hostnames and with SSL encryption. As a result, website owners have to then provide the CDN company with the required certificates who has to install them on their servers. However whilst CDN providers do offer SSL support as it requires additional setup and a larger infrastructure to implement this then it can become expensive as most CDN providers do not even offer this possibility as they are predominantly optimised for unencrypted HTTP traffic.<p>So if youre using a CDN switching to SSL-only can become more challenging and expensive than expected.<p>CDNs arent the only issue youre going to face either. Theres the other issue of serving content from third parties which you have no control over  Im talking about the social sharing stuff etc  and whilst most of them support the SSL/HTTPS protocol not all of them do, and for the ones who do support SSL/HTTPS you need to ensure that you are using the right code snippet that automatically takes care of switching to either HTTP or HTTPS for the external content and you may have to modify your code to ensure that this happens.<p>So if you are going to have SSL always on for your site, you need to ensure that all third party services support SSL because otherwise youll give your users browser warnings alongside some security concerns.<p>[1] <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/search-more-securely-with-encrypted.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/search-more-securel...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.ht...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257591"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257591</a>",1363539200

A computer is a tool, no different than a hammer in most peoples jobs. They read their email, browse some websites and do what ever specific thing in whatever specific application their jobs tell them to. They don't need to know anything about what the computer is doing and they don't care to know. Cars make more of an impact of peoples lives than their computers do but we don't have someone constantly saying how we need to make everyone a mechanic. Eating is more important to life but we don't have a movement to make everyone a chef.<p>Knowledge of how a computer works or how you make it do something someone else hasn't written an app for is just not at the same level that reading, writing and arithmetic are.

Because god knows we don't have enough euphemisms about operating systems and cars.<p>So Michelin has 80% of the tire market, and is releasing esoteric tires backed by huge marketing campaigns. They raise the price of normal Michelin tires for everyone, and offer their new esoteric tires to manufacturers at big discounts as long as they don't sell cars with other tires.<p>Cha-Ching every manufacturer says, people are clamoring over themselves to get this new tire. In order to support this new tire they had to build part of the car to these strange specs anyway, no other tire would fit, so the condition that they not use another manufacturers tire is an easy one to meet. Bouns: if they meet it they get a big bulk discount!<p>Jump ahead 2 years: buy a car. One without a Michelin tire? I'm afraid that's not possible. Yes of course there are other tires that meet the standard now, but we all know you're safer on a Michelin tire, and we all know it's easier to just use the Michelin tire. Why are you making such a fuss? Oh you already have some tires that fit? Ok well just buy the car with the Michelin tires, take them off, and return them to the manufacturer for a - oh wait they won't actually do that. They require you to return the car. Why? I have no idea. I guess cars are sold as a complete package, so taking off the tires is just pointless, you don't like the tires? Send the car back.<p>Manufacturers are starting to get burned though. Michelin has marketed well. There's a large portion of the population that do not trust tires other than from Michelin, those discount tires are costing allot more now adays. The threat of pulling their discount isn't even relevant any more. people just can't imagine driving on the road without a Michelin tire. Manufacturers try to sell cars without them but are greeted with poor sales, distrust, and even negative public reaction.<p>So you just watched this whole thing happen. Sort of like watching a car accident. You browse the tire section of Costco. 20$ for a set of Goodrich tires. 25$ for a set of Firestone. 235$ for a replacement set of Michelin tires. Oh and by the way no mechanic will touch your car if you don't buy Michelin.<p>I got to say, if I was standing there, the last thing I would think is ""I don't see what all the fuss is about.""<p>Personally, I am fussed.",1363538452

framework facets that enable more powerful and more maintainable component architecture for 
D3.js, the popular JS+HTML+SVG visualization library.<p>OrganicJS supports reusable components with chainable properties and public methods, dynamic 
setters/getters, reusable widget markup using nestable HTML/SVG fragments and in-place fragment cloning and rendering, and sharing of data/behavior among components in a soft, decoupled 
manner via contextual component caching.
OrganicJS re-envisions, re-implements and supersedes my earlier ideas around using D3, which can be seen here (while link is up, works on Chrome only)<p>One of the ideas is the support for borrowing of data/behavior of one component by another component in non-hardwired manner without use of events. Another idea is the building of widgets (collection of components)  from reusable, nestable HTML+SVG fragments, as an alternative to the way it is done in D3 (although the framework can still be used in the D3 way without the reusable widget markup.)<p>Demo:

Come to think of it, the whole beginning example would be very obtuse to anyone not familiar with programming at all: one of the things I love about Python is that it's easy to introduce to a total beginner, with something like ""it's like learning French or Italian, not a bunch of random symbols"".<p>- I personally love the way you do the main dropdowns.<p>- The topbar is nice too, but a bit less noticeable to me than maybe it should be. I think some tooltip-provided explanation (or similar) of  PyPi, saying ""Package Index"", might help those new to Python but aware of what a package index is. This might be unnecessary though.<p>- The location (and naming) of the ""Socialize"" link doesn't make much sense to me. What does it have to do with Search?

5389748,comment,5389288,5389288,13,0,rkl,,,"Hi everyone! I'm the writer of all those effusive Mailbox articles which supposedly drove up the valuation of Mailbox and helped it to be acquired for the benefit of the folks at CrunchFund. So maybe we should clear a few things up. The Storify version is here: <a href=""http://storify.com/ryanlawler/techcrunch-pump-n-dump"" rel=""nofollow"">http://storify.com/ryanlawler/techcrunch-pump-n-dump</a><p>But let's make a few things clear: I don't have any special relationship with Michael Arrington, MG Siegler, or anyone else who works at CrunchFund. I may see them around socially, in the same way that I see any other investors or entrepreneurs at events where those types of people hang out. But they don't pitch me startups they've invested in, and there's certainly no expectation that I, or anyone else at TechCrunch, be friendly to companies that they've put money into.<p>I joined Techcrunch more than six months after Arrington was booted, and well after the exodus of employees who worked for him started 'pursuing other interests.' I never worked with him, and besides exchanging pleasantries backstage at TC Disrupt, I frankly don't think he knows who I am. He certainly doesn't whisper secrets in my ear, and I couldn't care less about whether or not his little VC fund is successful.<p>I first reached out to Mailbox CEO Gentry Underwood in August of last year, because I heard he was working on a cool solution to email overload. (I think I first heard about Mailbox from one of his tweets.) It wasn't until December that I'd gotten a chance to test it out. I think I had it for about a week before I wrote that first article, and I loved it, and still love it. In fact, I have been using it as my default email client ever since I got it.<p>At the time I worried that the story would be seen as hyperbolic, but I believed in the product and thought more people should know about it. I thought it was an actual useful piece of software that could make people's lives better, so yes, I wrote glowing reviews of it. But at no point did I do so because of any influence from Mike, or CrunchFund, or anyone who had an actual vested interest in seeing Mailbox succeed or profiting from it.<p>The thing that annoys me about pieces like this are that they vastly overstate the influence that CrunchFund or any other VC have in our coverage. Yes, they frequently clue us in to cool applications they're playing with, but there's no real exchanging of favors that happens. I write about products I like, usually pass on those that don't interest me, but if there's the case where I test something out and it doesn't pass muster, I usually say so.<p>One final note: The most recent article I wrote was about Uber, which is also a CrunchFund company. That one was not nearly as positive as the stuff I wrote about Mailbox. <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/see-uber-this-is-what-happens-when-you-cannibalize-yourself/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/see-uber-this-is-what-happe...</a>",1363537505

I can text from any of my android devices, or any device with an internet connection almost entirely reliably. Here's the foibles though:<p>* No extended MMS support AT ALL. This means no pictures, no participating in group messages from iphone users, and most critically, all text messages sent or received over 160 characters aren't automatically concatenated like on the iphone and in the stock android messaging app, but instead chopped up into several 160 character messages.<p>* Quirky reliability. It's been getting slowly better, but there are small issues occasionally that are pretty rage-inducing. For example, before February of 2012, there was no queuing for SMS messages. If you tried to send a message and  it failed, (which happens a lot) too bad, you got to try again. So when they did implement it, (way after the introduction of the product, I might add) it was slow and argumentative as to which messages actually got sent out and when.<p>* Product support. Lusting after a basic new feature for GV? Having an issue where some messages are duplicated 4 times and sent to everyone in your address book with the same first name as the recipient? (it happened to me. The solution was to name problem contacts things like John1, John2, etc. until an unspecified update fixed it) Just curious about the future of the product? Too bad. You will be lucky to get a minor update a year later which addresses a complementary issue or concern. No amount of support questions, bug reports, emails, or even community outrage will get anything out of Google concerning GV. It took them months to update it to the ICS app standards, and they did so without any warning or response to users who had been begging Google to fix the buggy Gingerbread/Froyo-imbued app since Honeycomb had come out. For some reason Google is hell-bent on being tight lipped on this particular product and none of its users have any idea if it will even continue existing for the foreseeable future. Now that Google has used it to datamine a bunch of voicemails for transcription data, it feels like we're just along for the ride on this product that we rely on every day.",1363537273

We live in an era where we've learned to accept the things around us - No matter how good or bad they are, but we've over the last few decades, started to accept the things that are going around us, and accept compromise, slowly.<p>News organizations like Techcrunch, Gizmodo, etc. are some of the most arrogant, unethical organizations you will ever find on this planet. I say unethical because of how they work. In the REAL WORLD, journalism works by having REAL journalists, who travel places, meet new people, explore new problems, explore un-identified areas of coverage and report them as news.<p>But, the internet revolutionized journalism so much that it's so screwed up right now. In the online world, all you need to call yourself a 'journalist' or a 'media organization' is just a hosted Wordrpess blog with a custom domain. And that's just it. The worst part is the content - Where journalism by itself is known for the kind of content it provides, this is totally eliminated. In many ways, an online journalist has not much work to do, when say compared to a real life journalist. The information he wants to report on is RIGHT THERE. Just go to news.google.com, news.ycombinator.com, reddit.com, find some controversial (most cases) topic to write about, add some opinions and publish it as a post. BINGO! Just watch the comments pour in and pageviews explode! And profit!!!<p>Do you know what is unethical about this setup?<p>These so called 'journalists' are basically thieves. They 'steal' from an open community like reddit or hackernews, add their own flavors and spin it off into a new article.
I want you to browse through the whole list of articles on Gizmodo and Techcrunch and compare it with the sh*t these organizations write and tell me this is not true. You will easily notice that majority of the content is ripped off from the open communities.<p>These so called organizations and the idiots calling themselves journalists are a shame to the true essence of Journalism. Because what they are supposed to write about is the news and not what they think of it. I am sick of reading anti-Google posts and pro-Apple (or vice-versa) articles on these shitty so called 'news' sites. I want to read true, unbiased, uncolored content.

In CS, the assumption is that aside from minor (and easy to detect) performance penalties, returning a nonsensical value from a function is harmless.<p>But libraries like jQuery actually give <i>meaning</i> to ""no return"" in some callbacks. They cleverly let that be the most common behavior, and then let return values specify less common behavior. An example of this in jQuery that creates even more aggravating bugs is event handling.

> What's cryptic about [...] ? You learn it [...] and that's it, not cryptic anymore.<p>It's hilarious how you state some fact explicitly with your own words and yet completely fail to realize this fact.<p>Readability is not to be confused with familiarity - and you do exactly this. You say that if you learn something it becomes readable, which is not the point, and not true at all.<p>Think of readability as a measure of how many things you need to learn to understand something. If you introduce a symbol which meaning is completely arbitrary and needs to be learned, you make your code less readable. While Wikipedia page[1] concentrates on the readability of texts written in natural language, it suggests that the more words the text uses, the harder it is to read.<p>The second part of readability is text length, and so sometimes introducing a symbol to represent common concept, while making it harder to read by itself, makes the program more readable as a whole because it makes the program shorter. It's a trade-off that needs to be considered when designing a language.<p>The 'class' keyword in CS is a good example: it codifies a useful idiom, that in JS takes 5 lines of code, into a single word. While you need to learn it's meaning, which on the one hand makes the program less readable, on the other hand it reduces the length of certain class of programs significantly and so it makes them much more readable than JS counterparts.<p>The 'if ... then ... else' is a bad example. The ternary operator does not reduce the length of any program significantly, especially in the presence of the 'switch' statement. Every time you use a ternary operator you still need a test, true expression and false expression. Ternary operator introduces the infix syntax, and not one, but two symbols that you need to learn. It's <i>bad</i>, <i>really bad</i> for readability.<p>The code written like this:<p><pre><code>    if (alive and kicking or dead) then (something) else (something els)
</code></pre>
is much more readable than equivalent:<p><pre><code>    (alive&&kicking||dead) ? (something) : (something els)
</code></pre>
because the latter is not significantly shorter and it introduces as many as 4 (!) symbols with arbitrary meaning. You may not recognize this, because you already know the meaning of all of these, but objectively the latter form <i>is</i> less readable.<p>Your statement that boolean operators are more readable as symbols than as words is simply not true, at least if we use the definition of readability from wikipedia. You are much more comfortable with these operators as symbols, you're more familiar with them and used to them, but that is something entirely different than readability. You <i>think</i> that it's readable, while it's not.<p>I wish more people actually knew what readability is. Relevant info is just a click away, yet everyone seems to have his own definition of readability, which makes any discussion highly subjective and useless in the long term.<p>[EDIT] Forgot to mention, this is exactly why I find discussions on Lisp or Smalltalk syntax so infuriating. People are not interested how readable the syntax actually is, that is - how many symbols it introduces and how many of them are reused in different places. They say that the new syntax is ""unreadable"", while it is much more readable than alternatives, just unfamiliar.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability</a>",1363536704

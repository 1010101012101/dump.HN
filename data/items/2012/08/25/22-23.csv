4433640,comment,4432475,4433052,1,0,Someone,,,"I checked this, but only got more confused. I made a copy of TextEdit, did all kinds of things with it (append some text to the executable, edited Info.plist and version.plist, threw away a zillion localizations, threw away the _CodeSignature directory), and never got Mountain Lion to complain. The mangled either launched or, in one case (I tried renaming the executable and adjusting the .plists to match), did not launch at all.<p>The only way I could get a code signing warning is by adding the com.apple.quarantine extended attribute (using xattr)<p>So, it looks like Mountain Lion only does a signing test for just downloaded apps, and then, I guess, only for downloads by applications that cooperate and set that flag.<p>I do think Apple has considered/is considering/would like to add more testing, though. Otherwise, I cannot explain the -P flag for codesign:<p><pre><code>  -P, --pagesize pagesize\n      Indicates the granularity of code signing. Pagesize must be a power of two.\n      Chunks of pagesize bytes are separately signed and can thus be independently\n      verified as needed.  As a special case, a pagesize of zero indicates that the\n      entire code should be signed and verified as a single, possibly gigantic\n      page. This option only applies to the main executable and has no effect on\n      the sealing of associated data, including resources.</code></pre>",1345935594

I actually read all of <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> on my iPhone 4S earlier this year, and probably do an hour or two of reading on it a day in total.<p>It's not necessarily an ideal experience, but it certainly isn't terrible. I'm looking forward to the rumored 4"" screen on the upcoming The New iPhone, but I think that 4.5"" and 5"" are both way too big.<p>The impression I get is that most larger screens out there today don't pack in larger pixels, but instead just use bigger pixels. Ultimately, I'm more interested in the quality of the text than I am the total number of lines I can see at one time.

If your framework takes 10ms to load, it doesn't matter if your database is taking 200ms or 2ms to return it's result, you still pay the extra 10ms for the framework loading.

4433623,comment,4433347,4433428,5,0,rjdagost,,,"Totally disagree on the ""zero risk"" of being a startup employee.  Startups have some benefits for employees but they have a host of negatives as well.  Your typical startup employee is going to work more and get paid less than your typical big company employee.  In the highly unlikely event that a startup does have a big liquidation event (IPO or a big acquisition), employees get their often diluted equity converted to cash after everyone else- if at all.  Then let's think about the risk of going into work and finding that the doors of your unprofitable employer are locked for good because the VCs pulled their remaining cash.  You can learn a lot at a startup (I certainly have) but you can also get stuck in your employer's technological niche with knowledge and skills that aren't all that transferable.  Then let's cover the fact that being an employee at a startup is often a lot more stressful.  Zero risk?  No way.",1345935308

What makes people think that Apple products and Samsung products are the same is the fact that Samsung intentionally ripped them off to get exactly that. Apple did not do this. Samsung did and the lawsuit was so they could stop it. If this story is true, which it kind of sounds like it isn't, then the only reason people are being vocal about it is because of the news. They're now comparing the two side by side and saying ""hey, they look the same so they must be like the same thing"". Up until about two months ago I was dirt poor (as in I only ate once a day, if that) and my experience with Apple products has been then you definitely get what you pay for in a good way which is why I have bought so many despite my door poor-ness. Samsung making their products look like Apple's was meant so people like me (minus the tech savviness) would buy them thinking they'll get the same thing. You really don't.<p>But I digress.

4433621,comment,4432635,4433502,11,0,catch23,,,"No, it's not a blow to innovation.  The only reason Apple went after Samsung and not HTC or other Android handset manufacturers is because Samsung has gone into detail copying every small feature from Apple.  If you look into Samsung's prior history, you'll see they do this for every popular product on the market -- it's part of their business model, and it's not focused specifically on copying Apple.  They copied Motorola products before the iPhone came on the scene.  The details of the blatant copying are addressed in that 127 page ""smoking gun"" that was released recently.<p>I think businesses that focus on cloning other people's successful products actually reduce innovation because the innovation comes from the initial product inception, not from a copy.  If cloning actually increased innovation, we should be seeing lots of innovative products come out of china since they're so good at making copies of other people's products.",1345935283

Since my iPad is jailbroken I just SSH in, find the game directory and more often than not find my stats sitting there in a simple .plist file (maybe a binary plist, but then you just use the appropriate editor), make myself an in-game millionaire, load it back up and enjoy the game at max power for a few minutes before turning it off and never thinking about it again, a 'weight' lifted off my shoulders. It shocks me, how when the grind is suddenly removed, my interest in such a game that minutes before I had been feverishly, morosely addicted to, /completely evaporates/.<p>It's funny how me doing this is quite comparable to piracy, but - rightly or wrongly - I feel almost no guilt about doing this because by the time I've got to this point I've lost all respect for the game anyway.<p>It's ironic how Apple's locking down of the device is enough for most developers not to bother obfuscating their game save files so that if you have taken the trouble just for that jailbreak step, you're unlikely to meet much further resistance.<p>And finally when I do run into a game which has apparently taken cursory defensive steps such that my crude hackery only succeeds in stuffing everything up and losing whatever progress I did have, this too turns out to be funny. As I have no impulse to start playing from the beginning again, I breathe that very same sigh of relief, and forget all about it. Win-win.",1345935179

From what I've seen, the aquihiring companies will offer on anyone who can get to 'hello world' of startups.<p>> the trend to acqui-hires is particularly insidious for investors<p>Obviously, if you already have investors and you take the acquihire, there should be a long conversation w/ the investors first. At this point in the company, the acquihire is a signal that the startup won't work, or new investors won't join.<p>Also, ""I need my investors to make 2-3x"" is a perfectly valid negotiation strategy. For angels, that's a decent return. (Of course, matters are different for VC). But the bar for taking an acquihire after a series A is much much higher.",1345932697

The biggest what-if I'm wondering about is this: what if Facebook focused on becoming the first large social media company to offer its API as its core money-maker?<p>Zynga, presently, is worth ~2.5B. How many Zynga-like companies would there be if Facebook was focused on creating the best possible experience for their developers? The moving-target, locked-down API they peddle instead is a poor alternative motivated entirely by their focus on the advertising business model.<p>It's a big what-if, and the premise of my article is really that they should have found out before they settled on advertising.

Long lines are hard to read, short lines are more easily read. 4575 characters per line are regarded as the ideal range for the measure.

My manager once had to write my status report because I was so busy.He was a good manager but revealed himself to be totally clueless about what I was doing.Thereafter I became extremely serious and a bit paranoid about my status reports.<p>Necessarily a manager evaluates you by whether the product works or it doesn't and is on time or late. You are evaluated against management expectations. The more that they expect,the worse you do. Because expectations are typically unrealistic,you can get a fine reputation for perfunctory but consistently on time work.<p>Decrease early expectations to do well. During project planning be pessimistic and extreme humble. Programing and research have very high product and deadline risk. For each project have a contract with your manager that identifies the main risks, and accept responsibility for only what you can do something about. Your professional self management will impress your manager, but he will hate the uncertainty.",1276692905

1435353,comment,1434825,1434825,0,0,JeffJenkins,,,"There are a bunch of comments about what effect stereoscopic vision actually has on depth perception, so let me explain:<p>Depth perception from stereoscopic vision primarily matters for things which are very close to you.  I have amblyopia (1) and no particular problems in most of my day to day activities.  The main place that I lose out is in sports, where there are frequently small fast moving objects moving towards you and a small amount of time getting to them.  If I'm moving to pick up a glass of water things are going slow enough, and I have enough other feedback mechanisms, that I can determine the distance by the time my hand reaches the glass.<p>My favourite story about depth perception was when I was playing ping pong with a friend of mine in university.  I'm not a great player, but we were going back and forth okay.  Then on one of the returns he very slightly changed the speed that the ball was coming at me.  I completely failed to hit it, and it became clear that I had been using timing as a mechanism to help me compensate for not knowing where in space the ball was.<p>It's unclear whether it's because of choosing activities based on what my condition lets me be good at, but I don't find the lack of 3D vision to be my biggest issue.  My biggest issue is that when doing things I need to rotate my head to focus on things that are on my left.  This is a really big deal when I'm biking, because I am frequently out in traffic.  Since it still functions as peripheral vision I am aware of what's going on on my left side, but I have to turn my head way over to get more detail.  This is unsafe since when I turn my head I'm more blinded on the right side than I was on the left when I was facing straight.<p>(1) Amblyopia causes the image from one eye to be suppressed.  In my case it means that I'm primarily looking out of my right eye, and my left eye functions almost solely  as peripheral vision.  I can also force myself to switch which eye I'm looking out of, but I default back to the right eye if I'm not focussing.",1276691945

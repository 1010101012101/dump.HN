I&#x27;d question the security, is there going to be an exploit where someone can intercept signals to the door, and then use them to open or close it on their own when I&#x27;m away?<p>2. What happens if I arrive home, and my network is down? Or what if their cloud servers are not responding? What if I open the door for a delivery guy like the other poster mentioned, then the network fails, and I can&#x27;t close it? I&#x27;m at work, and my package and home is now open.<p>3. In one of their use cases they mention setting up a schedule, so it opens when your kids get home. Same as the above, if the network isn&#x27;t responding, your kids are locked outside. This means they need a key to open the door as backup, so what was the purpose of the automatic schedule in the first place? What happens if they&#x27;re running late from school, my house is open when no one is home again?<p>4. What happens if I have something below the open door (although not in line with the sensor), and it decides to close itself because of a schedule, or someone else in my family triggering it online? For example, the trunk of my car goes up fairly high. If the door closes while the trunk is open, the braces hanging down could potentially hit it. So if I&#x27;m unloading my groceries, and my spouse is at work thinking the door shouldn&#x27;t be open, we have one scratched car.<p>5. It&#x27;s another piece of technology to micromanage. I don&#x27;t want to start worrying about the schedule of my garage door. I enjoy the simple life.<p>Anyway, this is too much thought for what it is, but you get the idea.",1400218888

That&#x27;s even less setup than this one (no attachment to the opener or the door). As a big-name commercial project, it&#x27;s a pretty closed system, though. There&#x27;s a JSON API, but it&#x27;s not meant to be used except by their web/phone apps. There&#x27;s a plugin to add it to Vera home automation hubs, but I worry about the longevity of it since I think such a thing is still against the product&#x27;s TOS.<p>They also have the newer &quot;Universal Smartphone Garage Door Opener&quot;, which works with pretty much any brand (adding Linear, Genie, Overhead, Stanley, Wayne-Dalton) since it appears to use a light/IR sensor to detect open/closed state and acts like any remote opener to control the door.<p><a href=""http://www.liftmaster.com/lmcv2/accessorydetail/19898/liftmaster-myq-garage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.liftmaster.com/lmcv2/accessorydetail/19898/liftma...</a><p>The only reason I bought one was because none of the do-it-yourself or crowdfunded options were so plug-and-play, and I don&#x27;t have the patience for wiring up weird circuit boards to the back of my openers and hoping they work. I also care a bit about obeying local laws that say a remotely controlled garage door must have an audible warning before it&#x27;s closed, so that you don&#x27;t accidentally crush a child you can&#x27;t see is playing under your door. Most of the DIY stuff doesn&#x27;t have that, LiftMaster&#x27;s does and it&#x27;s a bit like a smoke detector going off for 5 seconds before the door starts closing. There&#x27;s no sound if you close it any other way (wall buttons, a normal remote in your car).<p>I don&#x27;t really get what this site is offering, but if it were the same thing as what LiftMaster sells but self-hosted or with a much more open API, I&#x27;d have paid money for that instead.",1400217887

My understanding was that warrants being required for content was statutory.<p>I took a look at Snapchat&#x27;s law enforcement guide[0], and it does say that they will turn over everything they have with only a subpoena. However, the records they say they will provide all look like metadata, not content. The guide mentions &quot;Log of the last 200 snaps sent and received (similar to phone record)&quot;, but I believe they are talking about metadata associated with the snaps, not the pictures themselves. &quot;Phone records&quot;, in this context, refers to phone metadata (logs containing numbers called, etc.). This Techcrunch post[1] also says that Snapchat deletes photos from its servers as soon as they are delivered.<p>If the reason that Snapchat doesn&#x27;t require warrants is that they keep fewer records than other providers, and don&#x27;t have the type of records for which a warrant is required, that should not be considered a privacy negative for them.<p>The EFF&#x27;s report also claims that AT&T and Comcast don&#x27;t require a warrant for content. However, that isn&#x27;t because either company has been implicated in actually handing over content without a warrant; it&#x27;s just because they don&#x27;t explicitly mention requiring a warrant.

But we associate the effort required to perform all those, so to have enough morale to perform hard work by accepting sacrifice, some may need (irrationally) to perform other kinds of sacrifice.<p>Let me clarify this in the east asian setting: sometimes just prizing the result (good grades, acceptance at university) will not actually provide good results because kids (and people in general) are not perfectly rational and can&#x27;t clearly make a  best strategy to their goal. So people start prizing the necessary (but not sufficient) steps to reach the goals, namely sacrifice -- which leads to the stupid biases of putting unproductively much study, working an unproductive number of hours, and so on. Another reason there may be a bias toward sacrifice is that the other side is usually much worse (i.e. major unwillingness to put up work), so society overcompensates.<p>So even if you look at it rationally, it may make sense when you take into account our psychological quirks. Of course, it&#x27;s all the best that we <i>don&#x27;t have those</i> to begin with, and I figure a great part of our learning is simply bypassing those natural barriers, optimizing for results.",1400217138

Distractions have greater penalties.  Currently the kids are toddlers and I basically get only 2 hours of solid work a day.  But there is so much one can accomplish if one stays focused.",1400216686

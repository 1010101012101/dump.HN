Well, two of the four browser vendors, you will find that browser vendors would like to extend the reach of the browser.<p>Not sure how that is surprising.<p>The argument for wanting to target all of the platforms seems nice.  Except the major tooling companies that want to target multiple platforms have already learned how.  Seeing games come out on PC, Xbox, and Playstation is proof enough of that.<p>So, again, what does this buy that the tooling does not already support?

It is my understanding that the alleged &quot;backdoor&quot; is based on the fact that the kernel allows the baseband processor to access the device&#x27;s filesystem over this bus, via the libsamsung-ipc component. Please do correct me if I&#x27;m missing something here.<p>Now, if that&#x27;s correct, then this is in fact significant, because the baseband processor would not otherwise have such access to the filesystem (since it&#x27;s <i>not,</i> as I understand it, running in the kernel as a driver).<p>All that being said, the entire thing hinges upon <i>what really goes on in the baseband processor?</i> There are certainly legitimate engineering uses for such filesystem access (as pointed out elsewhere in these comments), so is there really a corresponding backdoor in the modem to allow an attacker full filesystem access on Galaxy devices?<p>We may never know...",1394668365

You can stream videos over the web and that is more convenient that using DVDs. you get &quot;facts&quot; from wikipedia and similar resources and thats easier than picking dead tree encyclopedia. This is about convenience. When games start being playable on browsers you won&#x27;t need a local install or different ports for different platforms. You will need just a browser. It won&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re on windows, mac or linux. It will just work. That means reduced cost for the studio. That means less support calls. That means easier setup.<p>That will also mean that people will be able to experience with less mainstream stuff. Sharing stuff on the web doesn&#x27;t require Apple, Google, whatever company approval. It becomes easier to create content and users have less resistance to opening a web page when compared to installing a game. Also its safer since JS language is pretty safe regarding exploits and viruses and general malware when compared with something built with native code on your machine.",1394668286

While the semantics of the pointers are <i>unusual</i>, I don&#x27;t think that makes it <i>that</i> much more complicated. It should also be noted that many of the proposed language changes make said table even <i>more</i> regular (e.g. replacing the [T] syntactic sugar for vectors with a more conventional Vec<T>.)<p>Rust <i>is</i> in some ways complicated, and I&#x27;ll grant that a beginner to the language will likely curse the borrow-checker more than a few times. But I don&#x27;t think Rust is nearly as complicated as it is sometimes reputed to be.<p>[^1]: <a href=""http://cosmic.mearie.org/2014/01/periodic-table-of-rust-types/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cosmic.mearie.org/2014/01/periodic-table-of-rust-type...</a><p>[^2]: <a href=""http://www.ozonehouse.com/mark/periodic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ozonehouse.com/mark/periodic/</a> is an egregious example.<p>[^3]: There are exceptions (e.g. the closure types) but they are few and easily memorized.",1394667811

Oftentimes, though, geologists and geophysicists will refer to ruptures as the surface break of an earthquake (where the slip on a fault reaches the earth&#x27;s surface), so some context is required to distinguish between the two.<p>The recent M 6.8-6.9 event occurred offshore, so it&#x27;s not entirely clear whether it broke the surface.  Most earthquakes below M 6 don&#x27;t, and most M7 do (if they occur in the crust).<p>The focal mechanism of the earthquake [1] (see how to interpret them at [2]), which shows (among other things) the pattern of stress change during faulting, does (from my visual inspection) indicate that the Coulomb stress change on the subduction zone north of Mendocino.  I&#x27;m not sure what the implications are for the northern San Andreas, which may not be optimally oriented to receive additional shear stress from this event, but I think the earthquake might have released some of the normal stress that keeps the fault from slipping there.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc72182046#scientific"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc72182046#...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/beachball.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/beachball.php</a>",1394667808

You may not be on an emerging market but people on most of these countries are enjoying what affordable smartphones can give them. In Venezuela alone Firefox OS already has a larger marketshare than Windows Phone. Firefox OS went from 0 to 16 countries, 4 hardware manufacturers and 4 global telecoms in 2 years. And it did that while being open, accepting contribution, encouraging sharing and open culture, placing privacy and values over profits. Yes, Android and iOS are larger, much much larger, but we need to think what kind of world do we want in ten years. A world where each mobile device is a silo with its platform under complete draconian control of a single company thats usually from the northern region of California or where each platform is embracing open standards, where apps are light and cross platform where people can go from consuming content to creating content fairly easy (HTML being way easier to learn than Obj-C).<p>There is a reason why we&#x27;re using the World Wide Web right now. Its not an app. Its an ecosystem based on standards where everyone agrees more or less to play by the same rules. Its also easy to learn so anyone can put anything online, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re building a home page about crappy gingerbread people, you don&#x27;t need permission from Apple or Google or a lot of knowledge to do it. The Web won as main medium to exchange stuff because its easy and open.<p>Initiatives such as NaCL and similar are not open. ASM.js based stuff work even on platforms that doesn&#x27;t support it. Its about being compatible and playing well with others.<p>Mozilla is a strong player and it is not playing a game where the others need to lose for it to win. Its playing a game where cooperation is the main objective. Firefox OS doesn&#x27;t need to win, it just need to show people that you can do whatever you need using web technologies that don&#x27;t belong in a silo.<p>Sorry if this sounds like a rant but I get really frustrated when people seem to be content to throw all the advancements we did for the web during the last 20 years into something as shallow as user base numbers.<p>Four years ago no one could believe that a whole OS could be built on top of a web engine. That browser would be able to play AAA games without plugins. That we could do videoconferences using p2p with nothing but HTML/CSS/JS and yet we can.

7389149,comment,7387413,7388766,2,0,mjn,,,"The Danish Social Democrats have lately been transitioning to this view (in earlier years, they much more strongly emphasized state ownership of the means of production). The buzzword &quot;flexicurity&quot; is a banner under which they&#x27;ve been explicitly pushing a decoupling of planning mechanisms from wealth distribution. The idea is that the economy will be &quot;flexible&quot;, so you can do whatever you want with a minimum of red tape, easy regulations, and easy hiring/firing rules, but on the other hand nobody loses too badly because there is a strong social-safety net providing the &quot;security&quot; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexicurity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexicurity</a>). So it&#x27;s easy to fire a worker, but the worker won&#x27;t get evicted from their home if you do. If they have trouble finding another job, they&#x27;ll get monetary support, retraining support, etc. In a way this makes it therefore even easier to fire them (because you lose the guilt aspect). Because benefits other than salary aren&#x27;t tied to working, employers also feel quite a bit of flexibility to change people&#x27;s hours: you can move someone from full-time to 3 days a week if business slows down a bit, without them losing their health insurance, which is a level of flexibility American employers don&#x27;t enjoy.<p>One way of looking at it is modulating the outcome distribution of the &quot;game&quot;. Yeah, games are a great way to test out economic ideas in &quot;competition&quot; with one another, but the outcome distribution maybe should be more shallowly sloped, not a winner-takes-all game.<p>I do think one important aspect is that the state still does make <i>some</i> planning decisions, especially on infrastructure. The decisions may be <i>implemented</i> with market mechanisms, by putting out a tender for the operating contract. But the state decides which metro lines to build, how much service there should be, what fares should be, etc. The state also centrally manages both the healthcare and university systems as a &quot;single payer&quot;, though some degree of internal markets exist within those sectors (especially in the universities).",1394667280

But until recently, I&#x27;d never really considered it as a serious job option. Journalism rarely pays a living wage. Trying to sell book proposals is like trying to make a career out of buying lottery tickets. Unless you are confident you&#x27;re the next J.K. Rowling [1], you should leave writing where it belongs: on nights and weekends, as a hobby. Or so I&#x27;d always imagined. And so I spent the last decade of my life resisting the call to foolishness and misadventure.<p>I&#x27;ve been lurking, arguing, and mucking about on HN for the last few years. I took awhile to realize that HN had become my primary outlet for writing. Once I figured it out, I committed more time to lurking here.<p>I responded to my first HN jobs post in mid-2013, for a writing job with Priceonomics (YC &#x27;12). They responded rapidly (same day, if memory serves), and I got to work right away. I have done some very fun, very interesting work with those guys. (And I hope to continue; in fact, I owe them beers when I get back into town!). That work went really well. In the span of three or four months, I landed an agent, a book deal, some NPR appearances, and some columns in national publications. I have yet to make Harry Potter money, let alone my previous salary. But in the meantime, I&#x27;m paying rent in San Francisco, doing something that doesn&#x27;t feel like work to me. That&#x27;s pretty cool.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve picked up a lot of freelance content marketing and writing jobs through HN Freelancer threads. I get a good response rate, and the people I work with have been awesome. I hope to keep landing these gigs every month or two.<p>And at some point, I&#x27;ll get around to writing that book.<p>I apologize if this post seems glib, humblebraggy, or even non-humble in its bragginess. That&#x27;s not my intent. I just saw this topic and felt an overwhelming need to share my story here. My path is atypical and ill-advised. Especially if you like making money.

Every application eventually needs some shared mutable state (even if it&#x27;s implemented at the database layer). One approach is to have a single fiber (or goroutine) in charge of managing state (Clojure does that with agents), but that doesn&#x27;t scale for multiple writers. Neither does a global lock over the entire data store.<p>Good concurrent data structures that allow multiple concurrent writers are necessary. Java has some good basic ones like ConcurrentHashMap, ConcurrentSkipListMap, and ConcurrentLinkedQueue. Clojure takes that a step further with transactional refs. For more interesting kinds of data it&#x27;s better to have a good in-memory transactional database.<p>So for truly &quot;sane concurrency&quot; you need both lightweight threads with CSP and/or actors, <i>plus</i> a transactional, concurrent (preferably in-memory) data store[2].<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/puniverse/quasar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/puniverse/quasar</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2013/10/16/spaceships2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2013/10/16/spaceships2/</a>",1394665870

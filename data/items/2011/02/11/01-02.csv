You're right that a video of people coding with their head down would be pretty dull, but that's not exactly what I was getting at.  Digging deeper than that, nobody you interacted with showed any enthusiasm or charisma.  In my mind (and maybe I'm overly optimistic/idealistic), startups are generally the most enjoyable and satisfying jobs out there - and it's not because of arcade games in the office.  Undoubtedly it's nice (and practically essential) to have outlets for releasing stress, but the satisfaction comes from doing real, valuable work, and I guess I just expected some of the passion and enthusiasm to come through in the personalities of the employees.  I'm not saying they don't love what they do - I'm just saying I didn't see it, which is slightly disappointing.  At any rate, I appreciate the perspective of the videos and look forward to seeing more.",1297389502

Because the unfortunate truth is that computer vision (right now) doesn't work.<p>Let me qualify that. From the academic / research point of view, there have been a collection of real successes in computer vision in, say, the last ten years. But my sense is that what counts as a research success is a long way from what counts as a practical business success.<p>For example, the best generic object detector at the moment is probably Felzenszwalb's using deformable parts-based models[1]. And it's just not that good. On the latest PASCAL object detection challenge, you'll see that its mean precision is only ~30%.<p>Scott Brown, the interviewee, sets Vicarious apart by highlighting the fact that their system will be neurobiologically inspired. But the idea of learning hierarchical systems that mimic the brain's visual processing system is hardly new, and the jury is still out on whether these systems can do better than the ""hand-coded"" systems like Felzenszwalb's. As a random example, see [2].<p>Like.com showed you can build a business that uses computer vision in some way. But as Brown snarks, they ""use a big bag of different heuristics to figure out the image."" For the time being, that seems to be the only way to get computer vision to work in practice.<p>That all said, I wish them luck.<p>[1] <a href=""http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~pff/latent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~pff/latent/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/ang//papers/nips07-sparsedeepbeliefnetworkv2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/ang//papers/nips07-sparsed...</a>",1297388238

2204691,comment,2190422,2190517,0,0,kd1220,,,"CMU here also.  I graduated several years ago, but I distinctly remember groups of CS students banding together to create things on their own.  That's start-up culture.  You get a bunch of motivated, technically inclined people together and build something.  The CS undergrad lounge always had people fiddling around with things and geeking out.<p>At CMU you are free to do what you want with your spare time.  There doesn't necessarily need to be a class for teaching start-ups.  A class can simulate anything (DDOS attacks, power outages), but whether or not that simulation is a reflection of reality once the student leaves the classroom remains to be seen.  Furthermore, if you need a class to learn something, then there are many hard lessons waiting for you in life.<p>The reason you get a CS degree at CMU is to become a better problem solver.  It's a very difficult course of study.  When I was there about 1 in 4 students dropped out of the SCS program.  If you make it through the program, it is a badge of dedication, and you are definitely transformed into a problem solver.  The environment in which you use these problem solving skills - at a start-up or a large corporation - should never be an issue, nor should it require explicit handling.<p>Often when I see a start-up populated with dropouts I'll think ""They couldn't even make a 4-year commitment?  Does that mean they'll only stick around here for 2 years before they split?""  And that is often the case. The infatuation with dropping out and start-up ""culture"" is purely romantic.",1297386356

I simply <i>must</i> get back on my meds.<p>Thinking...<p>I don't know what Atwood really meant, it's just a blog post, but I do think there is a real distinction between ""Hey you! Don't do that, it's dangerous!"" and ""You shouldn't be allowed to do that, you're not qualified.""<p>After all, I wrote this:<p><a href=""http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/04/is-strictly-equivalent-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/04/is-strictly-equivalent-t...</a><p>Which is definitely a kind of ""Don't do such and such"" article. But while I actually write code to make things I like easier, I have no interest in sitting down and writing code to make the things I don't like harder or impossible.",1215992711

They used a small sample size (20) and they did not correct for any differences in plane type, accident type, phase of flight, etc. You simply cannot draw any conclusions with their data set and methodology.<p>The probability of death is going to be overwhelmingly driven by the speed and orientation of the aircraft at impact, which is going to be determined by the cause of the accident, the skill of the pilot(s), and just plain luck.<p>You'll be much better off just picking the seat that you will be most comfortable in.",1215991725

245388,comment,245357,245357,0,0,DenisM,,,"Funny how airplane safety is discussed all the time whereas I see no similar posts for automobile safety.<p>40,000 people die each year in car accidents in US alone, which is a heck of a lot more than in airplanes. Unlike air safety, individual road safety can be increased by any individual; even the safest dirvers can improve thier chance of survival by expending extra effort.<p>Yet somehow it's a lot more exciting to worry about things you can't control and hardly know anything about. Humans are fascinating. One day I'll figure out what makes them tick.",1215991233

245385,comment,245071,245179,0,0,etal,,,"Some newspapers are completely free. Most charge a tiny amount to avoid the stigma of being a free paper (or, gain the credibility of a for-pay paper). The majority of the paper's revenue comes from advertising -- which also works online (setting aside the ad-block arms race).<p>As for investigative journalism, I suppose it's just a matter of finding someone willing to pay for it. There's the BBC approach of having everyone pay a little bit for relatively NPOV news, since that's worth a little bit to everyone. Alternately, there's what this article discusses: many small groups are willing to pay more for investigation that may support their own agendas -- or do the investigation themselves, and blog it.",1215990863

245383,comment,245360,245360,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Gilbert and Sullivan have a line: If everybody's somebody, then noone's anybody. I think this applies to online journelism. There are so many news outlets, blogs, etc. to be found online (such as huffingtonpost, politicalwire, thedrudgereport, to name a few for politics). This is so saturated that little distiungishes these, unless they are tied to ""big names"". So, for example, I always go to cnn.com if there is a big news story. It is about TRUST. I know I will never be misled by CNN. Good, honest, journelism that cares about ""TRUTH, JUSTICE, and THE AMERICAN WAY"" to coin a phrase, like ""The Daily Planet"" will never be outdated. So today we have a proliferation of online blogs and so on that more or less cancel each other out. When it comes to ""hard news"", news when it matters, such as the site I went to at around 8:45 AM EST on Sept. 11, 2001, that was CNN.com, not ""thedrudgereport"". True, trustworthy news organizations will have to have an online presence, streams to mobile phones, etc. but gadfly news blogs will never replace ""The Daily Planet"". Or won't until Lex Luther becomes CEO of google, that is, lol!",1215990775

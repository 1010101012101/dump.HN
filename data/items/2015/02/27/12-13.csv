If the user wants to resize the content area, he/she should do that through the facilities the OS window manager already provides.<p>Besides, a similar attack could be carried out even without the fullscreen API - just replace the page contents when the link is clicked, and the same people who don&#x27;t notice the changes in UI will probably not notice the address bar either (it also doesn&#x27;t help that browsers are attempting to deemphasise/hide the URL...)<p>If they wanted &quot;tighter controls&quot;, they should just remove the fullscreen API.

But I think I assume that the goldish hue comes more from the light, since the further down on the dress I look the more black it seems.<p>Phrased slightly differently: The yellow-brown (gold) color is most visible on the upper torso where the fabric (to me) is likely to reflect a light source specularly. On the lower part of the dress (where I assume) light is more ambiantly reflected I see black.<p>Looking at your color squares to the right it&#x27;s quite clear to me what my visual cortex is doing: It&#x27;s assuming that specular reflection expains the difference in color in the left column. So each color there is a superposition of two: the ambient color of the dress and the specular reflection of the light source. Separating those two gives me black dress and yellowish lighting.<p>UPDATE After writing the above I think I understand why it seems so weird to me to see white: I parse the light source as yellowish, so a white dress would never look blue in that light. To me seeing a white/gold dress requires contradictory hypothesis: the light source needs to be blue to explain bluish tint on white stripes; but it also needs to be yellowish to explain the &quot;gradient&quot; in gold/black stripes from top to bottom of the dress.",1425040479

When a product changes, it gets an event and updates its cache. It isn&#x27;t really a &quot;cache&quot;, since there&#x27;s never a miss.

Most developers I know that like Go have written tens of thousands of lines of code in other languages that do have generics and more advanced features.  You seem to assume that because people disagree with you, that they must just be ignorant.  How about if people disagree with you because we have different tastes in languages?  Some people love LISPs, they drive me crazy.  Some people love Python, I think it&#x27;s merely ok. ... I love Go, and you hate it.  That&#x27;s ok.  I don&#x27;t think everyone has to like Go.  But I don&#x27;t tell the LISP people they should drop all this paren BS.  I don&#x27;t tell the Python people that they should add braces and static typing to their language.<p>> what is it that you think people who want Go to have generics don&#x27;t understand?<p>...that generics are not needed in many of the cases where they&#x27;re used.  That YAGNI holds true a lot more often than they think.  I had actually started coming to this conclusion (about generics) before I even started writing Go - and I&#x27;d already started using them less.  Not having foo<bar<baz>> in my code simplified it a lot, and given that most of the time I only ever implemented one version... it just wasn&#x27;t worth defining a whole bunch of generic logic, when really I only had one concrete implementation that I&#x27;d ever use.<p>> My core complaint about Go: the authors simply have ignored decades of compiler research.<p>Not ignored, so much as &quot;considered and discarded&quot;.<p>You say you&#x27;ve written Go and the lack of generics was a problem rather quickly.  I have been writing Go for almost 2 years full time and 9 months on the side before that.  Generics have almost never been a problem for me.<p>I see two possible reasons why we&#x27;ve had different experiences with Go:<p>Either you happened to be working on a project that really benefits from generics (something that makes heavy and repeated use of trees or vector/matrix math, etc)... or you were trying to write Go code the way you&#x27;d write in some language that does have generics.<p>If the former, well, that&#x27;s truly unfortunate.  Go doesn&#x27;t work well for all projects.  I wish it were better at that sort of thing, and maybe at some point we&#x27;ll get some features that&#x27;ll help out with those pain points.  Maybe those features will be something like Generics... but I, for one, hope that it&#x27;s not just generics like everyone else has generics, because I&#x27;ve been there, and I don&#x27;t like it.   There&#x27;s a hell of a lot of code that doesn&#x27;t need matrix math and left leaning red black trees and such.  Go is good for all those projects.<p>If the latter, well, then you&#x27;ve really just shot yourself in the foot.  This is like taking a minivan offroading in mud and then getting mad that it handles poorly.  You have to use the language in the way it was designed.  Yes, this means you probably have to write a min function every once in a while.  Yes, this means you have to write a loop to test if a string is in a slice of strings.  Just like you can&#x27;t take the shortcut through the mud in the minivan.  Just like you have to write type classes in haskell, or getters and setters in Java.  Every language has its quirks.<p>All that being said, it&#x27;s also completely valid fot you to say you just don&#x27;t like Go. That&#x27;s fine.  I don&#x27;t like a lot of languages, even though many other people do.  But telling other people they&#x27;re wrong or dumb for liking Go is not a position you can really justify.

Otherwise, you end up with duplication and latency.<p>Routing and authentication are obvious candidates. It&#x27;s also a good place to track stats and tag each request with a unique ID so you can trace it as it flows through your services.<p>By &quot;deep&quot;, I mean that it should be application-aware. Caching is a good example. For many applications, url + querystring results in too many permutations. If the cache is aware, it can often use more meaningful keys. Additionally, events in the underlying services can be used to cache purge, which can result in a wicked cache hit ratio.<p>A more complex example has to do with duplication. Say you&#x27;re building an ecomm platform. You have a service for search, and one for recommendations and one for the main catalog. They all need to return the same representation of a &quot;product&quot;. Do you duplicate the logic? Do you tie them together and pay the latency and reliability price? No. Have them all just return IDS, and let the API Gateway hydrate the actual results. It&#x27;s a form of API-aware server-side include and it works well.",1425039426

Under one year olds have half of deaths and a big enough share of life threatening issues for all children under 15. Now every time they get a shot and then die/have a real issue, the mechanic of guilt and control will make parents want to find a culprit. Given that most of the life saving of vaccination doesn&#x27;t come from individual but rather mass immunization it is probably not the greatest strategy nowadays to fixate so much on the immunization of babies as a strategy. Society should rather aim at getting more people immunized long term. I for one find it utterly perplexing that in Austria where I live there is no immunization strategy except immunizing babies. Grown ups have to pay for their own shots, cannot get blood levels done easily there is no information except for tick vaccination because it is paid by pharma marketing dollars. Getting vaccinated in a society with good vaccination rate is like a blood donation. There is almost zero individual benefit. Society should recognize it and make it painfully easy and beneficial to do so. \nI am pro vaccination but I hate how it is turned into a moral question rather then a simple numbers game it is.

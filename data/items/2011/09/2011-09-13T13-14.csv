For the rest of us in the great middle, direct from manufacturers like HP and Dell is the best option.<p>I have not had the same experience as you with Dell; we have an established ""medium business"" account and get pricing online that generally reflects our base discount.  We can sometimes get more off by dealing with those salespeople (especially if it's near a quarter end), but in general we get a fair and predictable price, visible on the web site.  Servers show up (sometimes later then I'd like) configured as ordered, and just need put into a rack and powered on.<p>Our ""server specialist"" certainly isn't the most technical guy in the world, but he knows the hardware line in and out, knows what works, and what other people are using for similar projects.<p>I regularly buy servers with no OS (if I'm reusing an old MS license), or with Redhat (my standard OS) at a price competitive with others.",1315922352

It's good advice for one, because you really shouldn't support hardware makers that really don't care about you or the software you run. It also helps by making the more annoying people who can't be bothered to read the supported hardware list, yet ask for free support and complain driver developers are one or two generations behind Nvidia (or ATI's) employees with access to confidential information, go away.<p>BTW, I have a T-shirt that says ""no, I won't fix your computer"" too.<p>> The *nix community is generally quite friendly<p>Indeed it is.

The example in the post is less than 100 lines long, which makes it very difficult to tell how the python code could be shorter. For example, in this tiny example program he writes, the author creates a ""artist"" class:<p><pre><code>  class Artist:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name
      def __str__(self):
          return self.name

Anyone familiar with python will realize that if this is the only functionality you need, than a bare string could be used instead, eliminating this code entirely.<p>At the end of this article (Update 3), the author links to a  blog post that describes a reduction in lines of code from 90,000 to 12,000 after a re-write [1]. He claims that this reduction is more the product of increased domain knowledge than any sort of language benefit.<p>I think that really gets at the crux of the issue.

As part of that, I created a series of workshops around putting together a backlog when starting a project. There was no text -- it was simply pictures and me telling a story with them.<p>Two very interesting things happened. First, the students loved it. I'd talk/present for ten minutes or so, then we'd do stuff. Repeat and rinse. There was never a big wall of text for them to absorb, and I never read from anything. They were always <i>doing stuff</i>. And since it was stuff related to their specific project, even better.<p>The second thing was completely unexpected. The customer had a very mixed response to my material! It seems that they wanted something with a lot of text so that they could ""teach"" it themselves. A narrative, story-focused presentation that was integrated into the team's work was simply too difficult. They wanted a presentation that read like a textbook.<p>As far as being a good consultant goes, I'm not sure if I did a good thing or a bad thing in terms of the customer's long-term goals. But as far as the people I'm helping? I'm sticking to pictures and stories. Nobody wants to live through another Powerpoint hell, and I have no desire to put anybody through it again.",1315920024

You are trying to show people a single line of reasoning that leads to an outcome that, by the time you get there, will seem ""obvious."" It actually works in your favor if they can't keep all of the argument in their head, because then they'll only be focusing on what you are saying right now (and jumping to the conclusion you've compelled) and not looking for ways to examine the veracity or any limiting conditions of what you are saying.<p>On the other hand, when teaching anything with a conceptual framework (that is, not just showing people how to install Wordpress), it's good to show not only the result, or examples of ""truth,"" but also counterexamples.  It's often useful to help define a concept by also saying what it is <i>not</i>.  You want people to see all of the evidence and to be able to provide their own reasons as to the conclusion.  You are clear, open, and even emphatic about assumptions or limiting conditions (at least to the point where it causes no harm to leave out and would only increase confusion if included).<p>If you happen to be so lucky as to have a room full of people who all share the same conceptual framework and vocabulary, then standing up and telling a story can also be an effective teaching tool.  Mostly, however, we are being introduced to the vocabulary as we are being taught, and multiple channels of reinforcement are very helpful.",1315919865

In climates that require heating, this isn't waste: it's heating the house. In the winter, there's no reason to go around turning off all your lights and appliances. It all goes into heating your house, so the only cost is the difference in price between electric heat vs. oil/gas. So claiming that a decrease in energy draw for a light of X% translates into an X% improvement in energy usage is just wrong. (granted that in the summer, A/C must work in the other direction; but my complaint is that our discourse never approaches this level of nuance)",1315918963

The result is that you can't really plan anything until you start taking calls from extremely annoying Dell salespeople who eventually send you an offer with prices in it - an offer that may of may not contain the products you actually wanted. The worst part is that you just know you're getting totally ripped off (otherwise they'd have prices on their site) and that after this stuff finally arrives at your door the same obnoxious customer service reps keep calling you to sell you more stuff.

Once you have more examples you can have a gallery of them so people can get an idea of what they want and of what you can do.

1647299,comment,1645820,1646843,0,0,mikemike,,,"The performance problems originate in the design of your trace compiler, not in static vs. dynamic dispatch. Some suggestions:<p>* The interpreter should have a fast profiling mode (hashed counting of loop backedges) and a slower recording mode (for every instruction call the recorder first, then execute the instruction). Either implement it twice (it's small enough), use a modifiable dispatch table and intercept the dispatch in recording mode (indirect threading), or compute branch offsets relative to a base (change the base to switch modes).<p>* Don't record traces for a long time and then compile everything together. Do it incrementally:<p>- Detect a hot loop, switch into recording mode, record a trace, compile it, attach it to the bytecode, switch to profiling mode (which may call your compiled trace right away).<p>- Make the side exits branch to external stubs which do more profiling (one counter per exit). Start recording hot traces and continue until it hits an existing trace or abort if it hits an uncompiled loop.<p>- If you completely control the machine code generation (i.e. not with LLVM), you can attach the side traces to their branch points by patching the machine code. Otherwise you may need to use indirections or recompile clusters of the graph after a certain threshold is reached.<p>- Region selection has a major impact on performance, so be prepared to carefully tune the heuristics.<p>* Sink all stores, especially updates of the virtual PC, data pointers etc. Don't count on the optimizer to do this for you.<p>* Due to the nature of the source language you may need to preprocess the IR or you need to teach the optimizer some additional tricks.<p>- E.g. the loop [-] should really be turned into 'data[0] = 0'.<p>- Or the loop [->>>+<<<] should be turned into 'data[3] += data[0]; data[0] = 0'.<p>- It's unlikely any optimizer handles all of these cases, since no sane programmer would write such code ... oh, wait. :-)",1283197483

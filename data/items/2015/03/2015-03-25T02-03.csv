9260980,comment,9259364,9259364,0,0,krick,,,"This article might be quite nice example for why so many people angrily reject calling psychology a &quot;science&quot;. All that stuff is pretty much obvious in the sense of &quot;this is what one would assume about others music preferences&quot;, it&#x27;s all too ambiguous and, honestly, results of any &quot;study&quot; of that short may change drastically, depending on expected results and research methods used. The worst part of it is I very much believe there are some studies, that &quot;show&quot; these results (I didn&#x27;t bother to follow the links).<p>Of course, I haven&#x27;t done any &quot;psychological studies&quot; on that matter, but I dare to say that unbiased reality is much more prosaic and quite obvious for anyone who has experience of, well, <i>communicating with people</i>. The psychological portrait of a teenager who doesn&#x27;t actually know about most of music outside his favorite band/genre will correlate with the genre, because he didn&#x27;t really chose the genre: it is just part of subculture he belongs to, which is obviously related to person&#x27;s nature and culture of his time/location. It doesn&#x27;t have to (and probably even doesn&#x27;t) depend on music itself.<p>The same stays true about a person, that this teenager became after growing up. Obviously, these guys will be majority of any study of the sorts.<p>Finding some relationship between music preferred and psychological portrait <i>could</i> be interesting among a group of individuals, who have broad knowledge of music, and can name preferred genre, which they listen the most. These are always a minority, and unsurprisingly, any stereotypes about relationship between music preferences and personality just happen to be wrong to the point of being hilarious: such big is incompatibility between &quot;what this guy should be listening to according to stereotypes&quot; and &quot;what he actually listens&quot;. Even more often, though, anyone who has broad enough knowledge of music to <i>chose</i> a genre, fails to <i>name</i> a genre, because he really just has favorite <i>songs</i> or <i>albums</i> (for about any possible mood), not <i>bands</i> and <i>genres</i>.",1427251607

Languages that support tailcalls natively yield programmers that &quot;see&quot; tailcalls (so they don&#x27;t think about it more than necessary), and non-tailcall support yield programmers that &quot;see&quot; stack allocation on recursion (but they don&#x27;t think about the stack more than tailcall programmers do.)<p>Now, we both like the &quot;default&quot; behaviour that we have practised the most, because we really understand its limitation. When confronted with the other semantic, we can make it work, but it&#x27;s slower to trigger our reflexes, and causes frustration:<p>A tailcall programmer forced to use a non tail-call language will have to &quot;compile&quot; his tail recursion into a loop. A non-tailcall programmer forced to use a tailcall language will gain free stack, but won&#x27;t have to rewrite his algorithm.",1427251213

It&#x27;s still far from the level of performance you&#x27;d get from hand-rolled machine learning algorithms that take advantage of all sorts of insights you have into your data... but then again, in general programming, there was a time when compiler optimizations were so naive that you had to hand-roll assembly code for almost anything. I see probabilistic programming in a similar level of infancy, and I&#x27;m excited to see where it goes, especially with the backing of a large DARPA initiative [2] to do some really exciting fundamental research.<p>But there&#x27;s so much more to the &quot;invertible&quot; paradigm. SQL itself is exactly along these lines - your WHERE clause is just a filter function that works on a single-record level, but it&#x27;s interpreted as highly optimized instructions to iterate along data structures, to collect all the data that satisfies that filter function. Facebook&#x27;s Relay [3] is the beginning, I think, of a large push towards declaratively specifying data dependencies for web applications, and having a system that does all the heavy lifting of figuring out when to fetch data, when to push it back to the server, how to handle requests on the server, and how to handle mutations with optimistic client-side updates. All you need to think about is the easy question of &quot;what data might I need, and if it were to exist at any given moment, how would I display it to the end user?&quot;<p>Humans think generatively, whether it&#x27;s about data or formatting or GUIs or the physical world. We have all these ideas in our mind, and we can visualize how we would expect them to appear. When our computer systems can let us focus on those high-value thoughts, that&#x27;s what the future looks like.<p>So let&#x27;s cut the out-of-the-box parser thinkers some slack!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/2014/09/08/probabilistic-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/2014/09/08/probabilistic-progra...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.darpa.mil/our_work/i2o/programs/probabilistic_programming_for_advanced_machine_learning_%28ppaml%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.darpa.mil/our_work/i2o/programs/probabilistic_pro...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/wincent/598fa75e22bdfa44cf47"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/wincent/598fa75e22bdfa44cf47</a>",1427251146

Yosemite isn&#x27;t bad — it feels about as good as Leopard, and probably in need of it&#x27;s own &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; soon. But I don&#x27;t think Apple software quality is worse than back when we used Leopard, or Tiger or Panther, and so on. Lion was probably the &quot;low point&quot; of OS X software for me.<p>The ratio of good:bad in Apple software doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed much.

Normal concrete is in the 20 MPa to 50 MPa range and the strength needed is just a design parameter - it&#x27;s not a quality issue.  typically a slab for a house would be at the 20 MPa end and a massive industrial warehouse closer to 30 MPa (something to do with forklift wheels being small and hard), bridge spans etc ask a structural engineer.  the fact that China is using a lot of grade 32.5 concrete is more likely due to the fact that they are building a lot of infrastructure that requires... 32.5 MPa strength.  NB &#x27;Grade&#x27; in the concrete industry refers to compression strength, not a quality statement.  Every country has loads of standards about how cement is made, the constituents that can be added and how concrete is batched, delivered, structures designed etc.  Cracks and crumbles are more likley due to inadequate design and placement of the fresh concrete.

You do have to state your global property somewhere: the local tailcall annotation allow you to prove it today, not guarantee its survival upon software evolution.

I have already contacted my ISP and they are fine with me running it as long as I&#x27;m willing to deal with the hate mail.<p>My question is, what would be the best platform for running a hardened exit node? Here&#x27;s my thought process: an exit node would paint a pretty big target on my systems and I want to ensure the security of anyone wanting to utilize that exit. I want this segregated from my home network, and have found out that I can set up a switch to get a separate IP address from my ISP.<p>I was thinking ideally this would be run from a dedicated device (was hoping for something like a Novena but I currently lack the funds). Since I&#x27;m going for a hardened system, my first instinct is to go for OpenBSD as the base system.<p>If you were looking to do something like this, what hardware would you use? Would you go with OpenBSD or a different OS?",1427249644

Clojurescript as a language was announced in mid 2011, NodeJS came on the seen in late 2009.  Both were languages never or barely used in their respective domains (server vs client side), but NodeJS has clearly had way more adoption on the server side then Clojurescript ever has had on the client.<p>Unless we get significant browser buy in for other languages (aka not just Chrome) and much better tooling I don&#x27;t think any transpiled language is ever going to go beyond the minor niches they fill.  And I say all this as a huge Scala fanboy, having used it for years in a professional way, and being very interested in ScalaJS.  There simply isn&#x27;t a language that has the buy in and following Javascript has been able to develop.",1427249534

Any of the individual factors are arguable, but note that there are so many complications that it led to a unanimous decision. That&#x27;s an unlikely occurrence without some strong reasoning driving the disparate members of the court. If you disagree with a unanimous court, then its worth closely reading and trying to understand how they all came to that conclusion.<p>The foundation of the decision leans heavily upon a long history of fourth amendment findings and a preference for objective standards in law enforcement decisions, but that&#x27;s incredibly difficult to summarize. My best recommendation for the curious is to read through the leading cases on fourth amendment law over the last century to build an appreciation for this style of jurisprudence over officers of the law. (I know that&#x27;s an obnoxiously inefficient recommendation, I&#x27;m not smart enough / haven&#x27;t thought hard enough to come up with a more efficient way to get a curious reader up to speed, and apologize for that...)<p>If you want a &quot;gotcha&quot; moment that makes the case (probably too) simple, note that Wilker, arguing for the petitioner, at one point replies to Justice Breyer that his case is about agents that have 100% viewpoint motivations and 0% security motivations. Later, in response to a question from Justice Kagan, he admits that a reasonable security officer could have made these decisions motivated purely by security considerations alone. (Compare 33:30 with 37:30 in the oral arguments.)<p>There are a dozen factors that led to the decision, but if you want to reduce to one moment where the petitioner most likely lost the case, that might be it.",1427249464

8021485,comment,8021090,8021466,6,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"Not a woman, but its well known they buy several pairs of &quot;period panties&quot; as to not ruin their nicer ones. This seems to be tapping into that market by making an explicit &quot;period panty&quot; that&#x27;ll last longer, come in dark colors, has a pad, etc.  So instead of buying a cheap set of disposable panties and using those, you&#x27;d buy a few pairs of these that are specialized for the task.<p>No idea how pricing works out. In the end, it might be smarter to just buy a box of 10 granny panties at Walmart for 12 bucks than pay $20 a pair for these high-tech ones. (The 5 day set is $180.) Especially if they can only hold 2-6 teaspoons of liquid. Seems the &#x27;help a girl in the third world&#x27; narrative is pretty disingenuous here at those prices. Pads cost a fraction of that. This seems like something a western woman would use on top of a pad or tampon.<p>Does every startup need to be about &quot;changing the world&quot; and &quot;helping the third world?&quot; Its practically self-satire at this point and was expertly mocked in HBO&#x27;s Silicon Valley series.

8021464,comment,8020102,8021251,1,0,gavanwoolery,,,"Good points :) The only thing I would make a note on is luck in card games:  Some card games involve a lot more luck than others.  One of my favorite iOS games, Orions, gives you a set of random cards (assuming you do a random match), and from there you play whatever cards you want (your full deck, basically, which is a random subset of about half the cards in the game).  Of course, you have to build up enough mana to play a given card, and many increases by 1 each turn on its own.  Its possible to be given a crappy deck, but even those matches you can play out more deterministically because you know what you&#x27;ve got to work with; also this is part of the fun - finding a creative path to victory with a deck that you are not used to (building decks can be fun in its own right, but I (personally) prefer being given a random set of cards - this makes each playthrough more unique and exciting).<p>In shorter words, there are a few types of luck you could work with: luck of the deck, luck of the draw, etc.",1405101256

GCHQ&#x27;s retention goes back (very broadly) that far (it&#x27;s inconsistent) - and they have some access to each other&#x27;s networks (the NSA access GCHQ&#x27;s network via example.gchq.nsa.ic.gov, specifically, so for example <a href=""https://wiki.gchq.nsa.ic.gov/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.gchq.nsa.ic.gov/index.php</a> would get you to GCHQ&#x27;s internal MediaWiki if you&#x27;re on the NSA network - GCHQ use an internal .gchq TLD). They can query selectors on each other&#x27;s databases, and filtering of what&#x27;s &quot;not allowed&quot; seems to be very often up to the analyst. (Of course, I don&#x27;t know if they share <i>everything</i>. Probably not.)<p>The NSA&#x27;s own BLARNEY initiative for this stuff dates back to 1978, although I think GCHQ beat them to the punch in effective mass telephony intercept - the first one I&#x27;m aware of started in the early 1980s, although that is offline, and probably no longer archived as the media (digital tape with low-bitrate encoded audio) would probably have degraded beyond all usefulness by now (and it sounded pretty crunchy in the first place, I understand, kinda like a bad squelchy lower-side-band transmission!).<p>Remember, however, that they didn&#x27;t have the same kind of analysis capability back then that they&#x27;ve got these days (but they can probably go back and analyse old stuff they still retain). As Snowden&#x27;s disclosed, you&#x27;re seeing the newer systems having full-take ring buffers in nearline storage, followed by offline selection for recent access and analysis from that using a huge amount of distributed processing, and in turn automatic selected archiving out of that.

You can offer these kinds of &quot;a la carte&quot; services all day long, and they&#x27;re nice (on the surface) as long as they play nicely with each other in an open ecosystem -  e.g., &quot;let&#x27;s grab this identity provider, that storage solution, this analytics engine, etc.&quot; It might look similar to Heroku&#x27;s &quot;add-ons&quot;, but with components that perform more specific functions. I just don&#x27;t see that openness coming from Amazon, Google, etc. as they will all want to lock people into their services (which is understandable from a business standpoint). And unfortunately, anyone who buys into partial (and proprietary) solutions in the meantime are - in my opinion - just shooting themselves in the foot by limiting the use of their data.<p>Even in a perfect world with a vast marketplace of plug-and-play, interoperable cloud components, I would ask: is the &quot;soul&quot; of your app&#x27;s code really captured in a conglomeration of components like this? If you have a need for a backend with custom logic of any kind, I think you&#x27;re probably doing something unique (hopefully anyway). If you&#x27;re going to need some real, unique business logic that can&#x27;t be offered as an abstract cloud component, then I strongly suspect you&#x27;re going to want more control over <i>all</i> of the backend. Even Parse&#x27;s approach ends up looking more and more like a traditional custom backend system as you add more power to the &quot;Cloud Code&quot; approach.<p>As a programmer, you can often find libraries and drop-in components that accomplish 80% of what you need, so you write some custom code to &quot;glue&quot; those components together. That custom code usually contains business logic that really couldn&#x27;t be abstracted or offered as a drop-in component. Where does that custom code live in the &quot;perfect&quot; ecosystem of plug-and-play cloud server components? How do you control the thing which makes your app/backend business logic unique? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be in the client/mobile app as some people tend to think.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a good solution that combines these kinds of components with custom (and flexible) server-side code - I just haven&#x27;t seen what it looks like yet. If I tried to use this stuff today, I&#x27;d be kicking myself tomorrow as I figure out that it&#x27;s a pain to juggle data between components that I don&#x27;t control and components that I do control.",1405100863

One would assume that both competent terrorists and Russia have had proper NSA counter measures in place far before Snowden&#x27;s leak. Indeed, bin Laden was able to remain hidden for a very long time. What we have seen is plenty of stories of dumb Westerners attempting to become jihadists.<p>NSA blackmail is far fetched. Of immediate concern is NSA employees inappropriately spying on other Americans. This has already happened multiple times that we know about: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-23/nsa-analysts-intentionally-abused-spying-powers-multiple-times.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-23/nsa-analysts-intent...</a> Lapses at the companies which conduct bulk top secret clearance checks should only raise more alarms.<p>The most recent doc leak demonstrates that not only was a contractor such as Snowden capable of searching and extracting data but it was done so without the NSA having any idea. No paper trail. How did someone get certain information on you or did they? No one knows. Blackmail hardly necessary if politically charged attacks reap large rewards by crippling a citizen running for office or an attorney general investigating a corrupt corporation. Anyone could be targeted: a sitting congressman, someone running for office, a federal judge, friends, children, family. Conducted in a veil of secrecy with secret oversight guarded by a national security mandate leaves no accountability: a total abandonment of America&#x27;s foundation of checks and balances.<p>In the longer term, this behavior is more grim than that posed by a rogue individual such as Snowden. If the existence of the NSA and its spying on Americans is fundamental to national security anyone who opposes this behavior is as big of a threat as a bin Laden. It becomes appropriate to target not only Americans but also sitting government officials who pose a threat. Congress&#x27;s muted reactions could leave one to believe this is already the reality. At the least, the fear is there.<p>Integrity and values are shallow and attach only individually to a mortal man. If an institution or government is built without transparency and without a balance of power, eventually, at some time bad people will gain control. They may be intentionally bad, seeking nefarious and self-motivated gain, or it may be unintentional: simply an absence of knowledge in a certain area which produces disastrous decision making. The Catholic church abuse scandals presented a mixture of both. Because the institution was deeply opaque and without proper checks and balances, widespread failure occurred. Even lives devoted to continuous moral contemplations, recitations and displays of charity could make up for this.",1405100707

It all began when I was working from home for a startup in another country. I would work and in the evenings, I would quietly slip out to the courts, play for two to three hours, and return back to work. Tennis is an amazing sport, if you play it passionately and properly, and only just for fun. Once I got better, I began looking for local tennis circuits. The coach I used to play with put in my name at a local tennis tourney. It was the first tourney I ever played. And I was jubilated, not only at being able to play a properly arranged tourney, but at realising that what I previously thought that there were hardly any good players around locally was totally wrong. There were many talented players, of all ages, who were just as passionate about tennis.<p>I fell so much in love with tennis that it became the only thing I was passionate about in life. I dearly looked forward to slipping out of work to playing tennis. I participated in more and more tourneys, and even though I lost, if it was a good match, I felt extremely satisfied.<p>Last year, I quit my work from home job (which last 4.5 years), mostly because I felt I wasn&#x27;t getting anywhere working from home. I joined a local startup not too far from where I lived which was working on things I loved. Along with it, I switched tennis clubs and joined a professional tennis club where top-notch players coached and played and where I could find many a good player to play with.<p>All in all, I think that the advice, &quot;do something that has nothing to do with any of this&quot;, is really something you ought to try.",1405100523

Yes, Uber is better than cabs in the suburbs. But hardly anyone takes cabs in the suburbs. The only people who don&#x27;t own cars in the suburbs are people who can&#x27;t afford them and have to rely on the bus.<p>Your example about forgoing a second car totally misses the mark. Families have multiple cars in the suburbs for one of three reasons: 1) householders need them to commute; 2) stay at home spouses need them for school drop-offs and errands; and 3) teenagers need them to go to school, friends&#x27; houses, and after school activities.<p>Uber is not a practical replacement for any of these core functions. The average commute in Metro Atlanta is 17.5 miles and 30 minutes, or $30 each way on Uber X. A stay at home spouse will generally make shorter trips, but more of them. Two trips per weekday to pick up/drop off kids at school, and potentially several more for errands and after-school activities. Moreover, most of these will be multi-hop: drop the kids at school then drive to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription, then drive to the Costco to get groceries, then drive to Giant to get stuff you don&#x27;t need to buy in bulk, etc. Teenagers with cars will take several trips per day as well, to/from school and to after-school activities.<p>There&#x27;s a reason that the U.S. has almost as many personal autos as people old enough to drive them. In most of the U.S. you can&#x27;t even leave the house without driving, and unless you only leave the house once every other day to go to a place within 10 miles (which is nothing in terms of suburban distances), you&#x27;ll spend vastly more on Uber than on a personal auto.",1405099253

No, it&#x27;s probably going to happen like it usually does- somebody gets voted in for being less of a nutjob than their opponent, something bad happens, and the elected official uses that as a excuse for all the horrible policies that follow. It&#x27;s already happened at least once here with McCarthy; he was just a freakin senator, one of many across the nation.<p>It almost happened once again with 9/11. Bush basically gutted Habeas Corpus, since he decided that anybody arrested under suspicions of terrorism wasn&#x27;t allowed the protections afforded under it. The government could arrest you, send you to secret prison, and that would be the end of it since you were never allowed a trial.<p>True, none of the above examples are true fascism.

8021251,comment,8020102,8020593,6,0,personjerry,,,"Interesting criticisms, but I&#x27;d have to argue against most of your points here.<p>- You&#x27;re right: card games inherently involve luck. But games like Hearthstone and MTG let you control your deck so that less luck is involved. And I would argue Hearthstone actually has the better model -- there&#x27;s no way to get screwed out of mana or flooded with mana like in MTG.<p>- Card starvation exists, but is typically a problem with deck construction or gameplay rather than the game itself. Two ways about the problem in deck construction: more card draw, and bigger cards. Playing is more complicated, but consider keeping your options open rather than playing things immediately, since you can gain card advantage if you can 2-for-1. Consider the HandLock deck in which a warlock draws a huge hand to abuse abilities involving hand size. Rarely will their games go past 30 cards, and yet their hand is filled with options all the time.<p>- You are right, each class has but one or two competitive deck styles and are predictable. But knowing the meta is part of any card game, and I think as Hearthstone grows this will be better. Coming from MTG I found classes brought quite a variety of play styles (at least 9!), if somewhat unbalanced and artificial.<p>- Again you are right. This issue arises as a necessary consequence of classes. Blizzard has actively done this for balance. Cards outside class decks need to be generic or else they would make some decks too powerful in combos. For example I might want more spell power cards for my Druid deck but that would make Mage control decks unbelievably strong.<p>- This is a subjective point and your view is valid. IMHO their quest system is a pretty versatile option of getting gold. If you want you can play 2 games a day and earn 40 gold, or you can play 10 and earn 100, depending on the quest.",1405098847

However, people giving up their personal cars in favor of Uber + transit is a marginal trend at best. The basic bottleneck is: how do you get to work? Like most sunbelt cities, the jobs in the Atlanta area are scattered across the city and suburbs. The average person in the metro area drives 17.5 miles and 30 minutes each way to work.

8021203,comment,8020102,8020759,3,0,oyachai,,,"The event/listener paradigm is an interesting way of going about this, and I considered doing it that way at the beginning.  But, after some thinking and experimenting, I found the &quot;card use -> modify BoardState&quot; way more straight forward, especially since it leads to a nice recursive tree structure for the game AI engine.  The primary goal of this simulator is to do statistical analysis on deck performance, so I think it&#x27;s a decent way of going about it.  On the other hand, if my goal were to create an actual playable game clone, I probably would have taken the event/listener approach.",1405098230

I&#x27;m having trouble finding the link at the moment, but I seem to remember private pilots getting in trouble when they carried passengers (on the pilot&#x27;s schedule, not the passengers&#x27;, as in this case) who had a different purpose for the flight--in other words, both pilot and passengers had a purpose for the flight, but it wasn&#x27;t a &quot;common purpose.&quot;<p>The FAA letter also calls into question the legality of the entire purpose of Flytenow: The letter explicitly states that publically posting the particulars of the flight (destination, date, and time) is probably illegal.",1405098227

As you say, there&#x27;s no way to discriminate between relevant & polite ads and spammy ads except for human intervention. I&#x27;m not involved in the business (clearly), but I think the overheads are sufficiently small in the advertising business that that&#x27;s just not viable.<p>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t think advertising is a viable business model for web content in the long term. Spammers are going to spam, users are going to install adblocking software to get rid of the spam, and whatever&#x27;s left will either get caught up in adblock or be too cost ineffective for businesses to bother with.",1405098195

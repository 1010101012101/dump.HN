5194464,comment,5193085,5193085,2,0,dragontamer,,,"I'm somewhat excited about the ""Convertible"" concept. But technically, I don't think convertibles are quite ready yet for mainstream adoption.<p>Frankly, the real problem is that Intel / AMD chips are not ready to compete in this form factor. Intel is making bold new moves with Haswell however, and AMD is making big moves with Kabini, Temash and Kaveri.<p>In this generation, the lowest TDP chips are 17-Watt Ivy Bridges and 10-Watt Atoms / AMD Brazos. For whatever reason, AMD Brazos aren't getting used in tablets (they seem like a nice chip though...), the Clovertrail Atoms are too weak (lacks out-of-order execution, performs mediocre even compared to ARM chips, extremely poor GPU performance), and the 17-Watt Ivy Bridges use too much power compared to the 5-Watt Arm chips competition.<p>( Part of the reason is that Intel Atom chips are second-class citizens of Intel. They don't get access to the latest process, and were instead seen as a cheap cost-effective chip for netbooks, as opposed to a premium power-efficient but powerful chip that you'd expect in a tablet. )<p>With a power disadvantage, this generation of convertibles just ain't gonna cut it in terms of battery life / portability / weight. The CPUs require too much power, which require bigger batteries.<p>Next generation stuff from AMD / Intel however is looking quite exciting, and the potential standardization of widespread adoption of DDR4 for more power savings helps this form factor greatly.<p>In fact, Intel has introduced new instructions to Clovertrail Atoms and Haswell specific to new low-power states of the CPU. Intel's willing to change their instruction set to get better power savings.<p>True, Tablets will benefit from DDR4 (and already have the power-saving instructions Intel is only now implementing). But the real benefit of battery life stops being useful past around 8-hours or so. (With exception of e-readers and their 30+ days of battery life. Those things are amazing on vacation).<p>Furthermore, ARM chips are growing in a different direction in the near future... they're aiming at the server marketplace. The innovations of ARM 64-bit don't really translate to smartphones / tablets. Exciting for the server market, but I don't really see major innovations occurring for Tablet-space ARMs in the near future.<p>If the convertible concept survives till next year, then we'll see some real competition. In 2014, ARM chips will grow into the server market and attack Xeons / Opterons. And simultaneously, Intel / AMD solutions will have their first real salvo into the ultra-portable market.<p>---------<p>That said, the Surface needs to be made. Microsoft needs to innovate from the software side and figure out how to update Windows 8 to be more palatable for everyone. So even if Intel / AMD chips aren't ready to compete, Microsoft gotta move forward here. They're clearly falling behind in this race and need to put something out there.",1360450761

Yup.<p>Have you <i>seen</i> how my wife treats electronics? I can't say I didn't have notice--when I met her her computer was a netbook with three keys missing--but there is no way in hell she's touching my Surface Pro. No, she's getting an iPad, which I don't care when she puts it in the sink.<p>> 6- Need more hard drive space? How about attaching an external USB hard drive and, perhaps keeping all your dev work there for easy transport to your desktop? Yup.<p>Dropbox + Wifi?<p>> 7- Can you use that really cool RC Flight Simulator that comes with a custom USB interface to your JR9505 transmitter? Of course you can.<p>Why would I want to run this on my tablet?<p>> 8- Or, how about that receipt or business card USB scanner?<p>They have ones that connect to WiFi now.<p>> 9- That neat Logithech keyboard you use on all your PC's?

Please explain what magical elevator makes this happen, because VC-istan seems to be a combination of connections and luck, large organizations tend to be clueless and political, and academia has been dying for at least a generation and a half. What I've seen may be limited and atypical, but I haven't seen anything that looks like this. I've seen the same nonsense that humanity has been repeating for thousands of years.</i><p>The problem may well be the ""human condition"" as substrate. In addition to talent in whatever domain or particular desirable skill-set, a person also needs to negotiate other people. If a large project is to be accomplished, the talents and effort of large numbers of people need to be marshaled. Unfortunately, our heuristics for interaction were tuned to keeping together small bands of people primarily concerned with food and defense. (""Paleo"" BS notwithstanding, but this much is certainly true.)<p>What we have isn't a magical elevator. It's more like our brains doing Boolean algebra and predicate calculus. On average, we humans are notoriously unreliable at logic. So much so, we have terms for dozens of dysfunctions which happen all the time. (Fallacies.) With proper training and attention, we can be quite good, however. So it is with ""meritocracy"" and all of its various doppelgangers. The ""cream"" does rise to the top, but so does the scum. Talent can help you. ""Talent"" in the form of attributes that let you sleep your way to the top also help you. You can make it on sheer talent, but the ability to wage subtle, deniable psychological warfare on your rivals to diminish their confidence and shine will help you too. So will realpolitik maneuverings or just being physically attractive.<p>Many will just put it down to getting older and bitter, but the older I get, the more I realize that we really are (mostly metaphorical) feces-flinging, screeching, long-legged savannah-apes that just so happen to have exceptional individuals and exceptional moments of godlike beauty, wisdom, and insight. Neal Stephenson: The difference between stupid and intelligent people  and this is true whether or not they are well-educated  is that intelligent people can handle subtlety. The muck and mess of human interaction is every bit as subtle as it is unsavory.<p>(And the older I get, the stupider I feel.)",1360449899

Nobody cares what you did in high school as long as you keep up a 4.0 in whatever classes you did take. People will care where you went to undergrad, people will care where you got your MBA, but nobody will care about your high school (barring making old-money connections at a place like Andover or Exeter).<p>I quite enjoyed my high school experience, but for kids who didn't, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to push them to get out as soon as possible, and maybe take community college classes for awhile until they're ready for college.

I am just not good at school.<p>Two years later, when I did graduate, it was 1997.

A Haskell program emphatically does not have any concept of impurity or statefulness whatsoever, except in the form of `unsafePerformIO`, which circumvents the type system, only comes into play under ""extenuating circumstances"", and which an ordinary program has no use or need for.<p>The language itself does not have any notion of sequencing or order of evaluation, nor does it need one. It inhabits a pure, mathematical universe where such things have no meaning. Given an arithmetic expression such as<p><pre><code>    (1 + 2) * (3 - 4)\n</code></pre>\nit naturally makes no difference which parenthesized expression is evaluated first, because the evaluation of mathematical expressions cannot have side effects. It would be absurd to consider a universe in which such a choice could influence the result of fully evaluating the expression, because such a universe would be wholly unlike our own, to the extent that our intuitive rules of logic and causality would no longer apply.<p>Likewise, given the Haskell expression<p><pre><code>    putStrLn ""Hello"" >> putStrLn ""world!""\n</code></pre>\nit makes no difference which of the two IO expressions is evaluated first, because the <i>evaluation</i> of those values cannot have side effects. The second one may be evaluated before the first; it makes no difference. The <i>execution</i> of the resulting action <i>will</i> have side effects and impose sequencing, but there is no way to express execution or cause it to occur in the Haskell language. Execution can only happen ""outside"" of the context of the program itself, not in the program's abstract and pure universe, but in our own imperative and stateful one, as a side effect of the RTS.<p>A C program, to extend the metaphor, knocks over each domino one by one as soon as it is placed. In fact, <i>placing the domino</i> and <i>knocking it over</i> are one and the same thing. The programmer has no opportunity to leave the room before the side effects come into play, because imperative languages do not distinguish between evaluation and execution. A purely functional language not only draws that distinction, but eliminates execution from the picture entirely, leaving it to some external entity to actually do the deed that the program constructs from pure components.",1360448447

This reveals that you take an ageist position against teenagers. When I was fifteen I knew everything I needed to know about the world and I was studying higher mathematics full time in college. Teenagers can be just as intelligent and productive as anyone else. Despite this, you value the right of movie companies like Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, 20th Century Fox, Disney, Paramount, Warner bros, and Universal Studios to make a profit over the freedom of our teenagers to share with one another.<p>> <i>I don't care of those creators are profit-driven mega-corporations or starving artists.</i><p>The existing copyright policies are created by profit-driven mega-corporations rather then individual artists because the big corporations have all the political power, so you are implicitly supporting these corporations over individual artists.<p>Programmers would greatly benefit from living in a society where all software is free because they would never have to use a program that alienates them from the process of software production. Operating systems could be rebuilt to eliminate the user/produce distinction and to drastically increase programmer productivity. However, profit-driven mega-corporations like Microsoft and Apple cannot allow that because that would destroy their profit model.<p>Similarly, individual artists would benefit from the freedom to use our accumulated artistic knowledge without being alienated from it by the profit-driven corporations. Mega-corporations don't want that, they want what we have now which is copyright that lasts 120 years after creation.<p>> <i>Thought experiment: in games like World of Warcraft, weapons, armor, etc, are trivially reproducible.</i><p>I don't have much of an issue with participating in a virtual commodity economy for fun and not to make a profit. Blizzard makes its money off of WoW from subscription fees rather then game economy itself. However, some free-to-play games like Maple Story run cash shops for profit and I oppose the existence of such cash shops as much as I do all other markets that sell artificially scarce goods for a profit.",1360448347

However, it's really tough for me to get over Go's treatment of null and global mutable state.<p>It seems to me a bit of a waste to design a new statically typed language that intentionally allows the most common type error, as if Tony Hoare's Billion Dollar Mistake wasn't a mistake.

I have had to deal with peers more socially skilled than I using tricks and experience to throw me off many times, which I see in retrospect having gained enough experience.<p>-Also not going to college has stunted my intellectual development. I am not as good as I could be and I know it, though I also know that I would likely have had the same social difficulties and not succeeded there anyway. Something like Khan Academy, some guidance, and some support would have helped with this, but perhaps even then I would have been a bit behind my peers earning PhDs, I would have no way to know.<p>-Peers often hold their degree over me, to this day.

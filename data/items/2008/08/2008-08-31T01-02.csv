A written piece labeled under the heading ""Stevey's Drunken Blog Rants"" is not intended to be a carefully crafted treatise. A drunken blog rant is a drunken blog rant. I do not understand why people think that a drunken blog rant has to follow a format that isn't at all representative of a drunken blog rant. It's funny. If the problem is that it's not funny to you, then that's a valid viewpoint, and I can respect that.",1220147977

But it all just appears as opinion and I feel would be more persuading if cited some of the slews of studies.<p>On that note I love working out, in gyms and outside... its even related to my current web app, but telling people the benefits isn't really going to motivate them enough for a lifestyle change unless they enjoy it.",1220147572

They think too much in terms of what is possible and too little of the many forces of the market and government that hold them back.<p>I have little doubt that if we were building a brand new country from scratch with a huge budget, we'd all have cars that drive themselves. But, because some percentage of the population couldn't afford them in our current reality, it's greatly complicated by the fact that not all cars would be self-driven. So rather than having roads and central control designed to make computerized cars safe, which we could probably already do, we have to design ones that can drive down a 50 year old expressway full of human-driven cars.<p>That's how it works with most technologies. Legacy systems and things being good enough the way they are prevent the sort of rapid progress technologists always predict.",1220147251

Which is why it's unlikely to ever happen.<p>DNSCurve is a design that uses modern high-speed ECC crypto to do packet-transaction-speed security.

291164,comment,283639,283877,0,0,cben,,,"I want to focus on one point that I find an interesting study in language design:<p>> * I haven't found an expression that is better written as a list comprehension than as a map/reduce/select expression.<p>map/select are better <i>iff you have a concise block syntax</i>.<p>For mapping with a single ready function, all styles are reasonable:<p><pre><code>    items.map foo
    items.map { |x| foo(x) }
    map(foo, items)
    [foo(i) for i in items]
</code></pre>
Now suppose you want to modify the mapping function to foo(bar(i)).  You could cascade it:<p><pre><code>    items.map(foo).map(bar)
    map(foo, map(bar, items))
</code></pre>
but this quickly gets out of hand and makes modifications painful.  What you really want is a place to write arbitrary expressions instead of just a function name.<p>With comprehensions OR a good block syntax, it's a smooth transition:<p><pre><code>    [foo(bar(i)) for i in items)]
    items.map { |i| foo(bar(i)) }
</code></pre>
But without one, the change is ugly and annoying:<p><pre><code>    map(lambda i: foo(bar(i)), items)

</code></pre>
So why wouldn't Python just embrace a nice block syntax?
Precisely because this naturally leads to expressing most control structures as functions taking blocks!<p>Now that is not wrong in itself, but it is a question of taste.  Pythonic taste favors a different approach: instead of passing the block directly to a function, have a few built-in control structures that can act as combinators.<p>E.g. don't write an ""each"" method that accepts a block - write an iterator, and use the built-in ""for"" loop as a bridge between the iterator and the block.  Why would this be any better?<p>1. Because we can: it turns out that the vast majority of custom control structures can be sorted into a few patterns (iteration, pre/post guards, function wrapping), each served by one natural combinator (""for"", ""with"", decorators).  There is a price: it takes time until new patterns are recognized and the missing combinator is added (e.g. ""with"" is a very recent addition).<p>2. Decoupling: an iterator is a self-contained passive object that can be used outside of a for loop.  An ""each"" method takes control and is less versatile.<p>3. Readability: seeing the combinator gives you an immediate idea about the style of flow control.  This is just a matter of taste (Lisp and Ruby solve this with naming conventions).<p>4. Syntax taste: stupid as it sounds, passing blocks to functions is just alien to Python's syntax.  Many smart people tried to marry them - and it wasn't a pretty sight...<p>But in the end you can't judge decisions of taste by pro/con arguments.  You have to look at the sweet spots (and the sour spots) that arise in practice.
A particularly nice sweet spot that arose in Python is the combination of reduction functions with generator expressions:<p><pre><code>    sum(i**2 for i in range(10))
    any(p % i == 0 for i in range(2, p - 1))
    dict((v, k) for (k, v) in dict_to_invert)
</code></pre>
This is very cool because the map-reduce pattern covers lots of useful computations.  Of course it's just a one case and YMMV.  I'm sure Ruby has its own sweet spots...",1220146356

Although the sitting around all day was really bad, it wasn't too hard to get into a daily routine that included 2 hours in the gym.  Diet was only a problem until I found a place nearby that sold huge subs for $3, for whenever I didn't prepare my own lunch.<p>Sickness (eg influenza), alcohol, and lost sleep have had a far greater impact than work of any kind.  YMMV though, I've never been overweight in my life and have never been a heavy/frequent drinker.

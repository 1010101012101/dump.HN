8451408,comment,8449301,8451355,0,0,lrm242,,,"Estimation of one&#x27;s TDEE is pretty simple. Once you have a starting point, adjustment is common sense. If you&#x27;re not losing weight at the rate you expect, lower your TDEE and thus lower your caloric budget. Now, adding cardio into the mix is where things can go off the rails. One reason cardio can be BAD for a diet is precisely because it is hard to measure how many calories you burn while exercising. Estimate too low and you end up in much too deep of a deficit to maintain the diet. Estimate too high and you&#x27;re not losing as much weight as you want. These problems are easily solved over a long run if you can accurately do approximately the same amount cardio each time you do it, but this is also quite hard.<p>Cardio is great for heart health and overall wellness. It&#x27;s crap for losing weight effectively, IMO. The absolute easiest way to lose weight is to simply estimate your TDEE requirements using a sedentary activity level, eat at a 3,500 calorie deficit each week, preferably at 500 calories per day or cycled if you are lifting weights, and adjust accordingly.",1413248396
8451407,comment,8449301,8451366,0,0,nightski,,,"It&#x27;s not that I was disagreeing with you regarding thermodynamics, just that usually when that point is made the emphasis is on calories in (such as you are making).  From what I have seen it seems that many things, including diet can have a strong effect on calories out.  That is worth exploring.  I just simply disagree with the fact that all diets show few benefits beyond tricking the person into eating fewer calories.  How a particular diet makes you feel is an important part of the equation.<p>If I eat a poor diet and work out, that workout is going to be terrible (even if I ate a lot of calories for example).",1413248378

GHC, dependencies, etc. are only needed for compiling; according to <a href=""http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html</a> Pandoc can be compiled into a standalone binary. The Windows build on  <a href=""https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases</a> is 17.1MB and the Debian package in Wheezy is 18.9MB with reasonable-looking dependencies.<p>The scripts I&#x27;ve written (PanPipe and PanHandle) require a Haskell implementation and the Pandoc library in order to be compiled or interpreted. Once they&#x27;re compiled with GHC, they&#x27;re completely standalone.<p>My plan is to have my server recompile my site when changes are pushed to Git. I like having Emacs, GHC, etc. on my laptop, but not on my server.<p>I actually tried to integrate Babel with Hakyll originally, but hit a bunch of problems. I didn&#x27;t include that in the page since I thought it would be distracting. Most of it boils down to Org-mode&#x27;s HTML exporter being awkward to invoke as part of a UNIX pipeline:<p>- Emacs can&#x27;t handle stdio<p>- Org-mode has breaking changes between the version bundled in the latest stable Emacs (24.3) and that in ELPA (which I use)<p>- Syntax highlighting depends on the current Emacs theme<p>- Whole HTML pages are generated, which makes templating harder<p>- Anything which uses the filesystem leaves artifacts around<p>I did manage to hack together a shell script which created and switched to a temporary directory, saved /dev/stdin to a file, opened Emacs in batch mode, loaded Org-mode, opened the temp file, tangled the file, exported the file, exited Emacs, ran the result through some XSLT transformations and Python scripts to extract the data needed for templating, spliced the results through the templates, spat the result to /dev/stdout, switched out of the temp directory then deleted it. Needless to say, it was <i>very</i> fragile, and much more complex than writing these Pandoc filters!",1413248365

8451365,comment,8439977,8443693,0,0,dr2chase,,,"I think it&#x27;s a three-part problem.  One, it is a flow problem, and by removing congestion at one bottleneck you mostly deliver traffic more efficiently to the next bottleneck.  Actually increasing traffic flow is much more expensive than the cost of any single project.  Second, over time, you end up with induced demand -- if you actually do get rid of all the congestion, longer commutes will become more practical, and traffic will increase until the marginal-next-commuter is discouraged from adding his car to the scrum.<p>Third, economic arguments are a little dicey for driving because driving is filled with externalized costs, subsidies, overoptimistic assumptions, and dependent utility.  Driving creates noise and pollution (and it appears that the pollution is more deadly than crashes) but drivers don&#x27;t pay that cost.  There&#x27;s personal crash risk, but people tend to assume that they are careful drivers and hence less likely to crash than the norm.  The cost of the roads themselves is currently subsidized from the general fund; it&#x27;s not a huge external cost, but it&#x27;s a cost.  Driving also creates (perceived) danger to people biking and walking; that tends to encourage them to also drive for their own (perceived) safety, even when they otherwise would not, and the congestion costs of driving also delay bus transit, making it less useful (it&#x27;s already slower because of all the stops; traffic jams make it slower yet).",1413247181

The free market fails in cases as simple as &quot;The Stag Hunt&quot;, so it is ultimately the point of a capitalist government to intervene in any of the documented cases where the Free Market fails to work.<p>No anarcho-capitalist has ever given me a clear answer on how Cell Phones would work today if it weren&#x27;t for government regulation enforcing the 2.4GHz spectrum for Wi-Fi, and also enforcing the licensing of spectrum. I <i>like</i> the fact that it is illegal to disturb other people&#x27;s cell phones.<p>The Licensing of Spectrum is neither socialist, nor pure anarcho-capitalist. It is a mechanism <i>Americans</i> invented to avoid a market-failure cornercase. Without licensing of spectrum, competitors would create cell phones that disturbed cell phones from other companies. Without government intervention, it is impossible to create property-rights and &quot;ownership of spectrum&quot; that leads to today&#x27;s cell phones.<p>And all anarcho-capitalists I know of also understand that a consistent viewpoint of &quot;property rights&quot; need to exist for any form of captialism to work. If you&#x27;re like other anarcho-capitalists I&#x27;ve talked to, you&#x27;ll go on about Dispute resolution organization and how they&#x27;re different from judges.<p>The main problem is that if two Dispute resolution organization have different viewpoints on property rights (ie: one likes the concept of licensed spectrum and another one doesn&#x27;t), then property rights ultimately fail to exist at all, and then capitalism breaks down entirely.<p>The socialist approach to solving the problem is to have the Government own all cell phone companies. This is _very_ distinct from the American solution, where the Federal Government created the concept of &quot;spectrum&quot; that different companies can then buy and sell to each other.<p>So seeing the world as &quot;Socialist vs Anarcho-capitalist&quot; is extremely naiive, and absolutely frustrating to those who like to discuss policy matters. The world is <i>not</i> binary, there are many different solutions to a single problem. Calling everything you disagree with as &quot;socialism&quot; simplifies arguments into a &quot;them vs us&quot; situation and stigmatizes debate.<p>Honest, learn to call _real_ socialist things as socialist.

8451331,comment,8450414,8450414,0,0,hibikir,,,"The article also forgets a lot of second order effects that affect much of Spanish home ownership.<p>For instance, Franco&#x27;s rental laws have been weakened, but not by that much. Even when you could theoretically get evicted, a savvy lawyer can easily extend a renter&#x27;s stay at an apartment, without really paying a dime, for about a year without facing eviction.<p>There&#x27;s also pretty weak protections for renters whenever an apartment is vandalized by its occupants. It is not uncommon to hear stories about tens of thousands of euros of damage deal to apartments as retaliation to an eviction.<p>There&#x27;s also rent controls that make San Francisco seem like a libertarian&#x27;s wet dream. The longer you hold an apartment, the less likely than you&#x27;ll want to leave, and the less profitable it is to the owner.<p>Such legal frameworks make apartment buildings that are built and designed for renters, managed by a company, to be an exception rather than the rule. There&#x27;s just too much risk to take something like this on. So most rentals are really by people that own 4, 5 apartments, and select the renter&#x27;s very, very carefully. For instance, my sister got a rather good deal a few years ago on a little apartment for her and her husband, she was pregnant at the time. The reason the price was so good was precisely that she offered an extremely low risk for the owner: The apartment will get too small for my sister&#x27;s family by the time the kids stop being toddlers, she has great family references, and her job requires her to have a good public reputation. So she is a very small risk of staying there for very long, of damaging the apartment, and of becoming delinquent. A recent college graduate born in a different state and with a job would not be able to get the same deal, because of the different risk profile.<p>Another part that it&#x27;s not mentioned in the article is when your average Spaniard stops living with his parents. Unlike in the US, when adolescents move out of the house to go to college, many Spaniards will live with their parents until they get married, and Spaniards don&#x27;t marry young. This makes the share of owned houses pretty high indeed, as living with mom does not count as renting.<p>Spain&#x27;s cities are extremely comfortable to live in, if you happen to have a job, so I do not expect the number of elevators to change. Number of renters, on the other hand, could be changed pretty quickly by legislation: Protecting renters actually makes renting harder!",1413246416

Consider for a second the sort-of parable of Chesterton&#x27;s fence. As G.K. Chesterton wrote:<p>&quot;In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, &#x27;I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.&#x27; To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: &#x27;If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.&#x27;&quot;<p>It&#x27;s basically that whole Spolsky think about why you shouldn&#x27;t rewrite code from scratch[1]:<p>&quot;Back to that two page function. Yes, I know, it&#x27;s just a simple function to display a window, but it has grown little hairs and stuff on it and nobody knows why. Well, I&#x27;ll tell you why: those are bug fixes. One of them fixes that bug that Nancy had when she tried to install the thing on a computer that didn&#x27;t have Internet Explorer. Another one fixes that bug that occurs in low memory conditions. Another one fixes that bug that occurred when the file is on a floppy disk and the user yanks out the disk in the middle. That LoadLibrary call is ugly but it makes the code work on old versions of Windows 95.<p>Each of these bugs took weeks of real-world usage before they were found. The programmer might have spent a couple of days reproducing the bug in the lab and fixing it. If it&#x27;s like a lot of bugs, the fix might be one line of code, or it might even be a couple of characters, but a lot of work and time went into those two characters.<p>When you throw away code and start from scratch, you are throwing away all that knowledge. All those collected bug fixes. Years of programming work.&quot;<p>Broadly speaking: you, for ANY definition of you, are unable to design a perfect system at the first go. You will not account for all use cases, there will be edge cases you don&#x27;t consider, so on and so forth. But it goes further than that: if you want to design something better than C++, you need to understand why so many people use C++. If you want to replace CSS, you need to understand why CSS is popular. If your thinking on the matter hasn&#x27;t evolved much past &quot;CSS is unnecessary&quot; and blaming a single catchy essay for every decision you disagree with, then instead of writing essays about how everyone else is doing it wrong, maybe you should spend more time trying to understand what everyone is trying to do, why they&#x27;re trying to do it and what resources they have to do it with. And THEN maybe I&#x27;ll let you tear that fence down.<p>1) <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a>",1413245104

8451284,comment,8450487,8450913,0,0,Jun8,,,"This was my first time, too, and it was a fantastic event. Visiting the YC offices for the BBQ on Friday evening (really their extension offices/meeting building, I think the HQ is down the street) is a religious experience. And, yes, I admit that walking into that orange glory I was as giddy as a high-school groupie (wasn&#x27;t the only one!). The food was FANTASTIC (both days) and everything was well-planned. And it was all free. Amazing.<p>No event (esp. one this big) is perfect enough to not warrant and suggestions for making it better, though, so to extend this thread, here are a few of my own:<p>1. <i>+1 for more Office Hours</i>. I would suggest to pepper these in between talks, after a few back to back talks the audience got a bit of an information fatigue, I think. I saw a lot of people on their phones after 4pm. The informational value of the session on Saturdays were huge. IDEABOLT: How about having a web cast of these, I would pay to watch it and I heard other people saying so, too.<p>2. <i>More interaction with YC&#x27;ers and speakers</i>. Maybe this was an absurd expectation with 1,700 people in attendance but I was looking forward to saying hi to pg, Jessica, sama, and the gang during the breaks at SC and at the BBQ but couldn&#x27;t see them mingling with the crowd (could be that I was too preoccupied with the great food and drinks). Having the speakers available outside to ask questions would be great, too.<p>3. <i>Better nametags</i>. I think there should be a customizable area on the printed nametags, e.g. I would like to see people&#x27;s HN nicks (for those who want to put it there, of course). I know/follow quite a few people here but don&#x27;t know their names, this would have been helpful in saying hi to these folks. Also I saw a lot of people adding information by pen to their nametags about their startup, it would be nice to be able to do this at the signup web page, too. Now that I think about why not even include a NFC tag with more personal information, company website, etc. This would solve the problem of not remembering the names of the many people you chat with during the event.<p>4. <i>Startup story booths</i>. Picture booths are now popular at parties. Why not set up one which, when you enter your registration code, will tape you for 30secs. You can use this time to pitch your idea/company. These can then be posted online, voted on, etc.<p>All in all it was a great event to attend!",1413244983

3088487,comment,3088284,3088284,21,0,brass_cannon,,,"PayPal is horrible at providing support, documentation and resolution channels in these type of situations. They also, at times, can appear to arbitrarily take adverse action against certain accounts.<p>However, it's important to note that they hold the risk on these transactions. If the business goes under before pre-orders can be fulfilled, and the business doesn't have the funds to take care of all the chargebacks this event will cause, guess who pays out? PayPal. This scenario is the exception to be sure, but it happens with enough frequency that PayPal must implement <i>some</i> form of risk mitigation.<p>There could be other factors in play here, as well. Does the business have a poor history with other processors? Do the founders have poor credit? Maybe not, but maybe so. It's difficult to arrive at a concrete conclusion from this post. That being said, it's a possibility that PayPal has <i>not</i> assessed risk appropriately in this case. We simply can't tell.<p>Where PayPal could make situations like this better is by providing clear expectations up front as to how they assess risk, and what not to do with your account ahead of time. They could provide reasonable support to work with the merchant and get additional metrics / a better feel for the account. They could provide the above context to merchants when this happens. The best merchant account providers do this. PayPal fails spectacularly at the above, which is enough for businesses to <i>strongly</i> consider alternatives.",1318096769

3088464,comment,3087322,3087511,8,0,pbreit,,,"Regular merchant accounts are actually not as bad as people think. One major difference is that merchant account providers make getting started a pain. That's when they do all of their analysis to determine if they are comfortable processing for the merchant. PayPal on the other hand does little vetting up front, making the signup process smoother, but can come down unexpectedly later in a merchant's life when it detects risky activity.<p>This also affects how each implements reserves. While merchant account providers may institute a 5% or 10% reserve over 3-6 months, it is more of an insurance policy spread across all of its accounts since it doesn't have a good handle on which individual account will blow up. Whereas PayPal implements reserve only after it has detected risk, it immediately places a larger reserve.<p>It never ceases to amaze me how negative the sentiment is towards PayPal from an audience that I would expect to be much more understanding of how difficult it is to process payments in real-time. And that PayPal became successful <i>because</i> of its actions, not <i>despite</i> them.",1318096283

I largely view the company as genuinely innovative rather than insidious, but Jobs did famously institute a culture there that is in opposition to open source technology.<p>Apple and Jobs notwithstanding, Hornings essay mostly serves to remind meparticularly as someone who works in tech and has entrepreneurial ambitionsthat not enough people consider the most important questions regarding technological advancements.

I have been and still am a staunch believer in open source, but when I read comments like this from the person who's motto once was that everybody writing software should contribute the source back to the community, not because it delivers better software (due to the more eyeballs resulting in fewer bugs), but because it results in moving software forward quickly by virtue of helping each other out, I agree with the OP, it's time for a change.<p>Let me tell you something, free software or not, it was Steve Jobs, who told us what forward direction for software actually means, first by making GUI mainstream, then by making capacitive touch mainstream, and lastly by defining what a tablet form factor should and should not be.<p>If you think Steve's products hamper your freedom, I can argue the exact opposite, it was Steve who taught us ways to make technology more accessible by making groundbreaking innovations in user interfaces, which enables the non geeks of the world to use computers in the first place, I am pretty sure those users will feel more trapped in the command line interface that you envisioned for them, than they feel by not having access to the source of the painting app they have fun playing with on their ipad.<p>So if you cannot come out the frog hole that you have created for yourself, and give credit where it's due, then maybe you should shut the fuck up.",1318095366

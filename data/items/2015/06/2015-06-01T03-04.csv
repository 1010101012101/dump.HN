9636702,comment,9635244,9636522,0,0,curun1r,,,"Two points:<p>- I was giving advice to someone asking how to ask for a raise. Asking for a raise is always going to be somewhat adversarial. Either it&#x27;s a really small company, in which case money is likely tight, or it&#x27;s a large company and budgets have been set, so raises outside the normal cycle are always going to be difficult.<p>- As a manager, I try to preemptively ensure that my most valuable directs can&#x27;t pull this on me. I&#x27;ve got the industry data and I use it during the prescribed EoY period to suggest adjustments that I feel compensate them above what they would get offered elsewhere. I&#x27;ve recommended giving devs $10k+/yr in addition to their normal EoY raises simply because I thought there was a chance they&#x27;re getting down near their market rate.<p>If I err, it&#x27;s on the side of caring too much for my team and I try to take care of them whenever possible. But asking for an off-cycle raise is going to require a sell job on my part and I need them to give me the ammunition necessary or it isn&#x27;t going to happen. That&#x27;s just the way things are when you&#x27;re at a large organization with a reasonably-sophisticated budgeting process.<p>Perhaps that&#x27;s the other nugget to offer someone looking to get paid more...timing is really important. Management may be completely sympathetic to your request and agree that you should be paid more, but basically have their hands tied in terms of giving it to you. If you&#x27;re asking at a time when salary adjustments are common, getting a larger adjustment will likely be easier, especially if it&#x27;s tied to an above-average review.",1433130016

Your boss may be protecting you and your team by outsourcing responsibility for delays and failure.<p>2. If it is doable, it may be worth the extra cost of bringing it online faster using consultants. In addition, the consultants may be able to get out in front of the similar work in the other project you are working on...a pseudo-spike maybe...and add value to that project as well.<p>3. Part time consultants for full time projects aren&#x27;t a good idea. Solo consultants for team projects aren&#x27;t either.<p>4. The idea of undercutting the outside consultant&#x27;s price is a bad one. Consultants are valuable because of their experience and expertise. And anyway, without knowing the structure of the competing offer, there&#x27;s no way to make sense of reduced pricing. Some consultants low ball and then add extras.<p>5. The idea of employees negotiating big bonuses project by project probably doesn&#x27;t feet your employers business model. Awarding you the project means losing capacity on the other one. And as you note, they could just require you to work overtime and not pay you anything else.<p>6. You simply don&#x27;t have enough information. There may be many sound business reasons for outsourcing the work or internal corporate politics.<p>7. Bottom line is that the higher ups have looked at the situation and made a decision. If they had wanted your input they would have asked. If they had wanted to pay you extra to work on it, they would have approached you.<p>Wait and see what happens and learn.

9636623,comment,9636450,9636564,0,0,zanny,,,"> faulty intelligence is to blame for the Iraq war, it&#x27;s difficult for me to encourage less intelligence surrounding foreign intelligence gathering<p>How about - how would you rather spend your money, spying on foreigners living in destitution, or fixing our roads? The international spy network the US maintains is probably a paltry drop in the bucket of the preposterous defense budget in this country, but honestly anything to curtail that black hole of taxpayer dollars is a win in my book.<p>If we weren&#x27;t destroying the lives of millions around the globe with our imperialism, we wouldn&#x27;t have enemies to suicide bomb us with planes to require massive spy networks to try to catch American dissenters planning to commit jihad against us. The military industrial complex only exists insofar as the American people are complacent to being global police forcing their will upon anyone who does not fall in line with what the US wants. And that is after we already have trade sanctions that can decimate countries overnight.<p>This isn&#x27;t 1970 anymore. We don&#x27;t need to have a dick waving contest with the next largest nuclear arsenal trying to ruin the lives of billions of people in a juvenile game to show who is the coolest kid, whose god is the best, or whose economic model should rule the world. Maybe its time to just back the fuck off and take our tendrils out of every nation on Earth for once and maybe try to be good to our fellow man.",1433128015

When I brows YouTube and search for something, I want to open several search results/related videos in background tabs. But idiotic YouTube auto-plays videos. Autoplay is one of my most hated anti-patterns. I wrote a user script/chrome plugin that replaces all video page links with base64 URLs that insert a hop to the actual video page (including preview image) so I can keep using YouTube like I want it. I made it so that when i directly click a link it still goes to the watch page directly.<p>See:\n<a href=""https://github.com/panzi/intercept-youtube-links"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/panzi/intercept-youtube-links</a>",1402451641

7876215,comment,7872119,7875878,1,0,lcrs,,,"It does seem a bit funny to do it in two stages but it&#x27;s the standard way... it might seem more natural if you were to do the resampling stage first - resample by a factor of 2x and you have the same sound but an octave lower and twice as slow, then a 50% time-stretch gives you the original duration but maintains the new pitch.<p>The phase vocoder does use an FFT on each window internally, so that it can ensure the phases remain continuous when everything is merged back together.  There are variants that let you monkey around with the FFT coefficients before the merge, so you can pitch-shift that way, but I believe when you stitch it back together you end with with the exact same artifacts as the two-step way. I think people have concentrated on perfecting time-stretching since pitch-shifting can be derived from it.<p>The problem with doing an FFT on the entire length of the sample is that shifting all frequencies would then simply speed it up as well as changing the pitch ;)  Chopping it up into bits is key to separating the fundamental frequencies that we percieve as the general &quot;pitch&quot; and all the time-varying harmonics that we percieve as &quot;timbre&quot;.<p>edit: what is maybe a bit hackish is the crude resampling here - when going to the trouble of building a phase vocoder at least some linear interpolation might be appropriate rather than just dropping/repeating samples ;)",1402451155

This is great feedback thanks a lot.<p>* I&#x27;ll definitely provide more info on what happens after group play. We say in the rules that &quot;Predictions can be submitted at any time before the official start time of the concerned game&quot;, and this is true for all the games, including those in the knockouts. We thought that the knockout rounds would be extremely boring if your predictions are already set with the wrong teams. And you already got penalized for making the bad predictions in the group play. So we took the decision to open the knockout for predictions only when the teams are known, as it seemed to us that it would preserve the fun until very late in the competition.<p>* regarding the score inputs, actually I think this really depends on people. with my friends we wanted this level of details because it makes it more fun to us. To use your example, if I predict 4-0, you predict 4-1, and the actual score is 4-1, you will earn a few more points than me.",1402450020

You&#x27;re probably struggling more with Xcode and Interface Builder then with the Swift language itself. If you want to stick to JavaScript for that particular project, you might want to consider Appcelerator Titanium: <a href=""http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/</a> which allows you to build iOS apps in JavaScript. It generates an Xcode project which compiles to native code; with the limitation being that you only have access to a subset of the vast cocoa and cocoa touch functionalities. Basically, if there&#x27;s a particular functionality available in iOS which doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;stub&#x27; in Ti, you&#x27;re SOL (or need to find a 33rd party Ti module which might fill the gap).",1402449278

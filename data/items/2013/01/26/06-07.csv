Well, that must mean there's a patent application in the USPTO system! Sure enough, Quirky's patent application, dated September 7, 2011 (provisionally filed April 18), titled <i>Waste receptacle</i> [2]. Bill Ward is one of the inventors. I am not qualified to judge this patent against the one mentioned by OXO, so I invite others to compare the two.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quirky.com/products/36-Broom-Groomer-Broom-Cleaning-Dustpan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quirky.com/products/36-Broom-Groomer-Broom-Cleani...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US20120260453"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US20120260453</a>",1359183592

There were definitely people pushing for better visibility of the human costs of the electronics industry, but aren't we being a bit circle jerky here?  Well-orgaznied and vocal campaigns? I don't know what you're talking about, but suffice it to say I'm not sure this can't be mostly attributed to Tim Cook's increased focus on supply chain and manufacturing and the human consequences thereof.<p>Ultimately, there's clearly a net positive here: less violations of clear human rights concerns in Chinese factories. I think everyone can agree, that's a good thing. But I can't help but be worried about this notion that this is some massive ""win"" for a campaign pressuring Apple. This is a problem with the entire industry, and one that needs to be solved. Maybe it's a symptom of being the world's largest company, but too many hugely critical issues to geekdom (patent reform, the costs of cheap mfr labor,  etc) get oversimplified in comments like the above into some postured for / against Apple and completely miss the point.

5119556,comment,5119405,5119405,2,0,whichdan,,,"I also agree that saving up for a MacBook will be worth the money.<p>My first laptop was a Dell Vostro, which is essentially a rebranded Inspiron. The keyboard and screen were excellent. I had issues with stability (BSOD), the slow 5400rpm harddrive didn't have much kick, the trackpad sucked, and the AC port broke. Luckily, due to my warranty, they sent out a tech to fix the AC port the next day.<p>Next up was a Lenovo Thinkpad T400. While the trackpad was slightly better, and the laptop itself was built like a brick, the quality of the screen with subpar, I still had BSOD issues, and the overall performance seemed to degrade very quickly. Like you, I wanted some killer battery life, so I went for the 9 cell instead of a 6 cell -- basically, a larger battery that ""stuck out"" of the back. Brand new, the laptop was getting a solid 8 hours, but within 15 months, it was down to 3 hours. It was really, really disappointing. In addition, the default settings for the laptop being unplugged limited the power to the wireless adapter to 50%. This was buried under several menus, and caused me to have intermittent connectivity issues for the first year I owned it, until I happened to stumble upon that one setting. Lenovo didn't offer and onsite warranty, so I had to yank the harddrive out and send mail the laptop back to them to get it serviced.<p>Two years ago I got a 15"" MacBook Pro, and I'm still very happy with it today. My battery has degraded about 10%, so I get around 4-5 hours unplugged instead of 5-7. I opted for an SSD which was a massive performance gain compared to my old laptops. I haven't had any stability issues, and my performance is just as good as the day I bought it. The only issue is that I've had two power adapter cords break on me, but with AppleCare (totally worth the money) Apple has replaced them with no problem.<p>In terms of running Linux, you can very easily use VirtualBox (free) or Parallels (paid) to run Linux on OSX, instead of having to boot into one or the other. This makes it super easy to try out different distros, and if you run it in fullscreen, due to OSX's Virtual Desktops, you can assign Linux to your second desktop, and literally three-finger-swipe between OSX and Linux. It's really cool if you want to take advantage of Mac-only apps, but still get to play around with Linux. That said, the 128gb SSD might feel a little cramped a year or two down the line, but it's certainly livable.<p>Personally, 11"" is too small for me, so I'd suggest shooting for a 13"". AppleCare is $249, and you can buy it any time within the first year of owning your Mac (IIRC, all Macs have a 1-year warranty). That might make it easier to purchase one now, and deal with the extra cost later.<p>Really, if you have an Apple store or a Best Buy within driving distance, you should try out a half dozen different laptops. The difference in quality should be very apparent.",1359183200

5119541,comment,5118739,5118739,14,0,nextparadigms,,,"I'm confident VP9 has a much better chance of succeeding this time around. h264 was already widely supported <i>before</i> Apple decided to promote it against Flash. That's not the case with h.265 right now. It will have to start from scratch, which gives VP9 a much larger window of opportunity.<p>This is from November, where they posted they are about 7% behind h.265/HVEC:<p><a href=""https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/85/slides/slides-85-videocodec-4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/85/slides/slides-85-videoco...</a><p>I've also seen in another document I can't find right now them saying that work on h.265 started in 2005, while work on VP9 started in 2011...and they are already pretty close to matching it, and they are gaining 10% on it every quarter. If that's true it should be at least as efficient or more within a quarter or two, than h.265.<p>Then it will be just a question of adoption. Software adoption should be much easier. Many have already implemented VP8 (which is also slightly better than h.264 at this point - [1]), and I'm sure Google will use VP9 for HD Hangouts, and for Youtube. This time I hope they go through with their promise and make it the default codec for Youtube, with fallback to Flash for browsers not supporting it (only about 20% of the users are not supporting VP8 right now, for reference [2]).<p>That should encourage adoption by other video sites, and also chip makers. And that's I think the biggest hurdle - getting chip makers to support VP9. But now with Android's popularity and virtually every chip maker supporting Android, I think it will be much easier than it was to get support for VP8.<p>The nice part about VP9 is that it will also come integrated with the Opus codec inside WebM, and that should be a big factor in the adoption of WebM, too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pacoup.com/2012/12/20/vp8-webm-vs-h-264-mp4-december-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pacoup.com/2012/12/20/vp8-webm-vs-h-264-mp4-december-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://downloads.webmproject.org/ngov2012/pdf/03-ngov-vp8-update.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://downloads.webmproject.org/ngov2012/pdf/03-ngov-vp8-up...</a>",1359182872

But also he strikes me as distinctly Canadian in ways that go beyond having been born here (I'm Canadian). The point that he makes about adaptability to other cultures is salient. And the Darshan character's eager-beaver obligingness is a comedic exaggeration of Canadian ""niceness"".<p>It's interesting that none of the people who express annoyance about Darshan in this thread show any recognition of the distinction between the performer and his character  something Rowswell wrote about at length. Perhaps he is intrinsically annoying and his critics are on to something inauthentic in his act, but to a blank slate observer such as myself it seems as likely that his offense is to have over-accommodated the Chinese perspective instead of sticking with certain Western prejudices.<p>In any case he is an extraordinarily fascinating case study in the grey area between two cultures.",1359182658

It's a wasted emotion to me, as it does nothing to make anything better, and there's nothing I can do about what's in the past.  Somewhere, somehow, over the years, I've adopted something of a stoic mindset (even before I knew what stoicism <i>was</i>) and my outlook is just kinda rooted in that.<p>I also, for whatever reason, am much higher in terms of self-efficacy than self-esteem, and my self-efficacy is such that I pretty much always believe that tomorrow can be better than today, because I see no reason to believe there is any limit to what I can still accomplish.<p>That said, it gets tougher sometimes.

Somebody below mentioned CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), and from what I've seen/heard, I second the motion to find a pro to talk to about that.  But in the short term, you can try some basic CBT like stuff on yourself.  Check your inner dialog and when you find negative thoughts in you mind like ""Things can NOT get any better"", stop and ask yourself ""is that <i>really</i>, <i>really</i>, absolutely true?""  Force yourself to look for an ""existence proof"" of even ONE small counter-example that disproves the thesis that ""things can NOT get any better.""  Once you find that counter-example (and I'm pretty sure you can) then you have to force your inner dialog along the lines of ""OK, now I see that it's not true that things can't get any better.  So what other ways CAN things get better?"" and ""what steps can I take to move things towards a better state?"", etc.<p>You can also try going meta and ask yourself ""OK, I just thought this really negative thought.  Why?  What prompted me to think that?  And is whatever it was really <i>that</i> significant?  Can I just stop thinking about $WHATEVER?""  etc.  It's amazing how much you can change your mood and emotions by just consciously thinking about your inner dialog.<p>Anyway, I'm not expert or professional, so by all means, seek professional help if you find the negativity persisting and if it's affecting your day to day life in a bad way.",1359182622

You have none over the past, so focusing on it will give you the <i>impression</i> you are powerless.  When you stop exercising your options, you may start to believe you <i>can't</i> exercise them, then you stop looking for options/choices/opportunities, and stop seeing the ones you already have, and finally believe you have no options.  You can reverse this by focusing your attention on where you do have power.  Like a muscle, exercising your power increases it; by noticing your present options/opportunities, your eyes will get better at seeing them.<p>2. A way to feel satisfaction from progress in the present is to take a tiny action, and to compare yourself to where you were a moment ago. Tiny steps count and they add up. Add a little to a little and soon you have a big pile. A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step; any journey <i>consists</i> of steps.<p>This is the approach I try to take when I feel as you do, and it helps me.  As others have said, you're hurting, and it's important to take care of yourself.  Think of yourself as suffering a physical injury, and taking small steps is physiotherapy.

5119523,comment,5110921,5119362,1,0,zmmmmm,,,"I'm sorry I don't have time to answer in full. I'm just going to respond to this one point because I think it's pretty fundamental and perhaps explaining it will clear up other things!<p><pre><code>    > The dependency graph specifies what\n    > steps depend on what steps. If you don't\n    > know it, you don't even know how to\n    > start evaluating the workflow, because\n    > you don't know which step to build\n    > first. I don't understand this statement\n    > at all. Could you please elaborate or\n    > give me an example?\n</code></pre>\nI can see this is really really hard to grok if you're basing everything on the idea of a DAG, and so many tools are that it's very natural to think you couldn't do it any other way. Think of it as imperative vs declarative if you like. In Bpipe the user declares the pipeline order explicitly (as you've seen) - so that's the first part of the answer to your question. Bpipe knows which part to execute first because the user said to explicitly. But this isn't used for figuring out dependencies - dependencies arise as actual commands are executed. Back to our famous example:<p><pre><code>    fix_names = {\n      exec ""sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $input > $output""\n    }\n\n    extract_evergreen = ...\n\n    run { fix_names + extract_evergreen }\n</code></pre>\nWe run it like this:<p><pre><code>    bpipe run pipeline.groovy input.csv\n</code></pre>\nIf you run it once, Bpipe builds input.fix_names.csv. If you run it twice, Bpipe is clever enough not to build input.fix_names.csv again! How is that if it doesn't know about the dependency graph?! Well, it does it ""just in time"". It executes the ""fix_names"" pipeline stage (or ""method"") and that calls the ""exec"" command. The ""exec"" command sees that all the inputs referenced ($input variables) are older than the outputs referenced ($output variables). So it knows it doesn't have to rebuild those outputs, and skips executing the command. So what about transitive dependencies? If C depends on B which depends on A, (so dependencies are A => B => C) what happens if you delete file B? Technically you don't need to build C because it's still newer than A, but Bpipe can't see it any more. Well, Bpipe knows this too because it keeps a detailed manifest on all the files created. So when the call to create B is executed it can see that although B was deleted, it <i>did</i> exist and in its last known state was newer than input files, so there's no need to rebuild it, as long as downstream dependencies are OK.<p>So in this way Bpipe handles dependencies for you. What it does <i>not</i> do is figure out which order to execute things in. It does them in exactly the order you tell it. This is one of those things that conventional tools solve which isn't actually that important (in my uses) but which occasionally is very annoying - I actually <i>want</i> to control the order of things sometimes. I want to be able to tell it ""do this first, then that, then the next thing"" regardless of dependencies. Usually it's pretty obvious what the right order things should be in and there are other externalities that influence how I like to do it (""I know this part uses a lot of i/o so try to do it in parallel with another bit that's mainly using CPU"", or ""Let's run this part last because it will be after hours and the other jobs will have finished""). Having the tool think this stuff up by itself can save you a bit of time but it can lose you a lot because you don't have the ability to really control what's going on.",1359182353

If someone had the knowledge equivalent to a bachelor's level, does it seem correct that to be considered equal, the individual would have to pay for at least 3 years of school full-time (even if he tested out of easy classes) and paid ~ $50,000?  This is for a cheap school, not a top-tier.<p>This has never made sense to me.  Knowledge is knowledge - who cares where it came from?  I'm not saying other things are not learned in college - yes teamwork is important and such.  But you can literally learn that in any situation.  What about experience?  If you're not actively trying to go to school, and doing BS work, you can actually get a relevant job, show some creativity in your field, or (I wish) hopefully get an apprenticeship.  I hope these come back some day - the learning is unparalleled.<p>Three years ago, I spoke to a friend about designing a computer science bachelor's exam.  It could literally be as grueling as you want, over a 10 day period, and you could charge up to $5,000 easily.  Most people I spoke to said they had concerns about people ""cramming for the exam"".  In truth, those people do not know how to design tests.  It is VERY easy to prevent cramming, especially with such material, all you need is a little creativity.  By ""prevent cramming"" I mean creative questions that force the candidate to know the material so well that cramming --> learning involuntarily.<p>I chose to start with a comp sci exam because it requires the least physical resources for the exam (no circuits, no lab, no nothing).  Eventually, other degrees could be created once a proof of concept had been completed.<p>The original reason Universities were created were for efficiency (source: Sir Ken Robinson's TED talk).  Teaching 50 students by mail, making each one order each textbook and other reference texts is crazily inefficient.  Locating them all in one place, having lectures for all 50 students at once, and a library where all relevant texts are held is much better.  What we're seeing now is just a modern version.  Instead of lectures, we have video.  Instead of library, we have ebooks/internet/curated content.<p>Sorry if I rambled for a bit, I'm very passionate about this issue.  The thing is, without power in the field, changing education is hard.  This is definitely the gateway, and I'm happy that I get to see all the fantastic (but slow for me) changes.  The next step is re-optimizing spending in high schools.  My mother works at a high school, and the stories I hear about wasteful technology spending are hard to hear.",1359181806

If it costs, say, $1,000, you'd expect that to mean that people would spend around 10 hours actually verifying your work. And so, even if you have to write 10 papers and develop 10 projects, 10 hours of grading should be plenty to provide a fairly comprehensive assessment (30 minutes per large assignment is much more than most professors put in now. At least, in my department). For $1,000, you could even up the evaluation time to something like 40 hours (at ~$15/hr, plus administrative costs) by using TAs who really understand.",1359180480

I wouldn't really consider him a ""Canadian comedian"" so much as a ""Chinese comedian from Canada."" The entirety of his career as an entertainer has been in China, in the Mandarin language. His Mandarin is truly beyond native-speaker level.<p>But yes, as a white guy in China it is kind of annoying to have to listen to Chinese people bring up Dashan every time you open your mouth. In China, he is the original token-Mandarin-speaking-white-guy character. And I get the impression that he got there not just by studying Chinese really hard (way before it was cool), but also by agreeing to do whatever he was asked to, and never complaining about it.<p>See, as a non-Asian person in China, strangers will come up and ask to take their photo with you constantly. They will even approach you on the street, at school/work, or even while you're eating dinner in a restaurant, and proposition you with all types of casting calls for bizarre modeling and performance jobs where they <i>just need a white person, any white person.</i> Most of us politely decline--because it's creepy--but he seems like the guy that always said yes and hammed it up for the camera.",1359180076

I opted to work right out of high school and take 10 years getting my 2 year degree.  I worked for a very long time with a decent employer, and I built up great skills along the way.<p>In the past couple of years though things started getting bleak.  I was hitting the boundaries of what this employer could offer, and I could even say that it was a bit of an abusive work relationship(probably mutually).  My mood started getting foul.  People who I was good friends with I was having trouble getting along with.  I was drinking a lot to smooth things over.  My family life suffered.  Things were a mess.<p>One day I just had enough and got into counseling.  I took control.  I changed jobs, and stepped away from friends for a while and worked on family.  I doubled down on education(I had started on my bachelors a while back, but I recommitted).  Things got a bit better.<p>Then things went down a bit again.  I started reading more HN and r/programming to build up my professional chops.   I started feeling inadequate.  I felt like this new job I had wasn't cool or startuppy enough.  Doubt crept back in.<p>So I had conversations with a lot of people.  There was a guy on HN that was taking stories and giving advice.  He helped me a bit.  I have a pen pal kind of friend who has had cool experiences.  He helped me a lot also.  I talked to family and friends of all stripes about my concerns.  Basically everyone had the same thing to say, that I was living a good life.  That the kind of things I felt I should be doing have their tradeoffs as well.  That I should focus on what I am doing instead of always looking for major improvements.<p>And then I came to the realization that I was trying to live up to someone else's yard stick.  It took me 10 years to get an associates degree because I was raising a family.  I lost my startup because I didn't want to spend my entire life at a keyboard.  I was beating myself up about my job because I was trying to measure my career as an engineer against that of the internet's best and brightest entrepreneurs. I was trying too hard.<p>So take it easy on yourself man.  I am sure that you have some pretty awesome stuff going on in your life.  Take time to appreciate the things you enjoy.  Discard things that don't work for you anymore.  Put down HN for a while if you it is making you feel like you aren't doing enough(I had to for a while).  Make a change if it is smart for you to do so, and don't beat yourself if it isn't the right time.  But above all else, just cut yourself some slack.",1359180023

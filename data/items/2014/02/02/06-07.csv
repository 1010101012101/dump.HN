7165182,comment,7164482,7165169,5,0,kevingadd,,,"Infinite demand is absolutely false and the example I cited is really blatant: Eventually there is a backlash against destructive practices and they either get banned or die out. Nobody can leverage the acquisition/retention techniques Zynga used to get big because <i>they don&#x27;t work anymore</i>.<p>The idea of infinite demand for entertainment is trivial to disprove anyway: Gamers only have so much time in the day that they can devote to games, and only so much money they can afford to spend on games every month. If someone already plays multiple games, you&#x27;re competing to either grab an increasingly tiny slice of their time or convince them to replace one of the games they&#x27;re playing with yours.<p>Note that this is compensated for by the traditional model because the up-front payment provides an incentive for the player to finish the games they&#x27;ve already bought; for F2P/subscription games there&#x27;s no incentive to stick with a single title unless they find ways to keep you there.<p>Also, the claim that either WoW or the PC space are dying is blatantly false. PC games are doing fine and WoW still brings in tons of money (even if its subscription numbers are way down). It is true that the nature of the MMO and PC industries has changed but it&#x27;s not as if WoW killed anything.",1391324243

More than that though, is that in a connected world, basically anyone is able to become a competitor selling low-quality junk for basically nothing, or a pirate giving away your stuff. Being able to publish is no longer a gate that can hold prices high. We are in the twilight of this short-lived infinite marginal price to marginal cost ratio of digital publishing, and the games publishers are scrambling for the last rays of light by selling non-scarce product inside the games instead of the games themselves. This too will end as they eventually alienate enough of the customer base that they have to adjust their strategies to something economically sound.<p>If it turns out for games (as it did for journalism) that people just aren&#x27;t willing to pay as much as they used to for good content then we&#x27;ll see a smaller market. Whatever audience there is of folks that are willing to pay up-front for a good game (sans manipulative bullshit) and the developers able and willing to make those games seem likely to find that crowd-funding is their best option - publishers not required. Game-as-a-service (MMOs) have shown that they work well, and will need publishers if they&#x27;re to have high budgets and quality that players expect but players demand there to be some amount of service (you can&#x27;t pull a SimCity without pissing them off). There will always be some amount of this IAP model, but it&#x27;ll have to become tasteful enough to be sustainable in a world where the available audience of fresh unalienated suckers is exhausted (Valve&#x27;s use of IAP is a good example of what this is likely to look like).

It&#x27;s hard to make both the day care, and the office space work, and one side is probably going to suffer.  Do you focus on the day care, which is a larger market, but has high turnover (kids grow up fast), or do you focus on the smaller flex office space where you can potentially hook people for longer?  The flex office space might not be a good idea because many people might just work from home instead, and are really just looking for someplace to park their kids for a few hours so they can get some work done.\nCap that off with having to follow additional regulations around running a child care facility, and it makes for a pretty tough business.",1391322192

That forces them to use their own subjective judgment rather than attempt to cast about for some sort of objective definition of &quot;significant&quot;.<p>There are many reasons why I love this question.<p>First off, it puts things squarely into the realm of the real instead of the abstract. It can tell you a lot about whether or not you&#x27;re dealing with someone who gets things done or just someone who &quot;does work&quot;.<p>From there it&#x27;s a quick jumping off point into the specific skills and competencies of the candidate, viewed through the lens of productive work. It&#x27;s a way to see what skills people have in sort of a sideways way, because you see what skills they actually use, rather than the skills they tell you they have.<p>Perhaps most importantly, it tells you about a person&#x27;s priorities and values. It tells you the sort of things they think are important. Did they do something that actually delivered value to anyone? Did they do something that required overcoming obstacles or did they just cruise along and build something &quot;cool&quot;? Or something that was technologically sophisticated but useless in practical terms? Do they value titles and money over real accomplishments where something of lasting importance or value is built and delivered to users?<p>It also gives an opportunity to explore a lot of issues that are hard to suss out otherwise. For example, does the candidate have initiative or do they just follow along? Do they strive to improve the way things work or just tolerate the status quo? That can be evidenced if the project they describe was something they took on of their own accord or was handed to them, whether it was an internal improvement project, and whether they had to fight against the establishment to get things done.<p>So there you go. Values, skillset, competencies, initiative, and ability to execute. You won&#x27;t necessarily get all of that out of a candidate every time you ask such a question, but there&#x27;s no such thing as a perfect interviewing technique.<p>For someone straight out of college or without much experience of course you have to modify how you interview them, but that&#x27;s always going to be true, and sometimes this same question can still be valuable, just not in exactly the same way.<p>P.S. Also, just having a good set of questions or a good process to go through is not enough to make someone a good interviewer. Interviewing is <i>hard</i>, easily one of the hardest things in the profession, and only a small subset of folks who do it are actually good at it. I don&#x27;t know exactly how to make a bad interviewer into a good one, that&#x27;s a subject that could fill volumes and volumes. But I think this particular kind of question is, on par, much more helpful than not and a step in the right direction.",1391322051

It&#x27;s like the programming languages or favorite IDE discussions ... :-)<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s a huge potential for having one device that can be used with different UI concept based on the peripherals: A tablet docked into a docking station should be operated by mouse and keyboard (desktop mode), otherwise it should be operated by touch (metro mode). Windows 8 should recognize what default to use.<p>While Metro as default for a PC doesn&#x27;t make sense, it&#x27;s not really a big problem. The issue is mainly amplified by our emotions. It took me much longer to get used to OS X, but as I liked the device to much, it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I kind of enjoyed exploring how to use it.",1391321624

Even if we needed to pay for BitBucket (i.e. need more than 5 users on a repo), the cost for a company like ours that might need 20 users total on a repo is pretty minimal, and the pay per private repo on GitHub quickly adds up and passes the BitBucket costs.  From a pure cost analysis for private projects, I don&#x27;t see how BitBucket doesn&#x27;t come out on top.  Maybe if you only have 1 repo and 100s of users, but in the more average company where you have multiple repos and a smallish number of developers, BitBucket is almost always going to win the price war.",1391321388

The fact that they not only condone it, they actively encouraged it just makes me sick. How insecure are they? How stupid are they?

63308,comment,63217,63271,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"In general I would say Loopt is doing just about the best they possibly can given whats currently available. Last I heard Loopt's software was written in Java ME, which means they are using a GPS optional library (probably the Location API, or maybe OpenLAPI). Devices that support this are still few and far between. But they are on the rise. As long as a new device supports the required optional libraries, supporting it is not difficult (there are still usually quirks that need to be sorted out however, often requiring separate builds for each device even though its JavaME).<p>It may take a stomach to do this kind of stuff, but that is the cost of being on the bleeding edge.",1191544856

63304,comment,63028,63189,0,0,rglullis,,,"Thanks, guys.<p>I just need to clear one thing now: considering I incorporate in the US, how do I manage to ""pay myself and my co-founder""? I mean bills, common expenses, rent, food, etc? Can I transfer company revenue to a personal account? I know it is bad to mix personal/company cash flow, but is it ok/acceptable to use a corporate credit card?<p>I know that this is not something to worry enough to make me lose my sleep, I am just curious about how things are handled fiscally and in terms of accounting.<p>* edit: Removed the ""pre"" formatting. Sorry. ",1191544176
63303,comment,63138,63138,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Actually, the ""negotiation"" is proving what you're worth.  If, when you come in, you're relatively far along, have a really compelling demo, you can prove a huge market, etc...you'll get a better valuation.  The differences are small, but they do give somewhat different offers to different groups.  And, of course, you can still say no when pg calls to give you the terms.<p>But, do take pity on pg--he's frazzled on that day.  He calls everybody personally.  I was impressed by how nice he managed to stay through the whole process (and even moreso now that I've seen first-hand how crowded pg's life is with people who want to be around him).<p>We went in knowing that we'd say ""no"" if the offer involved more than 6% equity...but it rarely does, so that wasn't a big concern.  We're glad we weren't one of the ""no"" groups.",1191543731

I was touring with a band trying to play a show in Vancouver and we got banned for a year for lying to border guards. Boneheadedly, we let the bassist do the talking and the Canadians googled their way to quite a few holes in his story. ",1191543418

Would get you rice and beans money and 3 month trip to startup school in CA... If you get selected, of course.<p>It sounds like your core unmet need is a technical co-founder.<p>If finding a technical co-founder is your highest priority, you should be able to find one in Seattle.  Every event I go to I meet scads of ""I work at Amazon/MS ad I'm just seeing what's out there"" type of coders.  How many of those have you talked to?  Why aren't they jumping on board?<p>Like any other marketing, if you aren't getting a ton of nibbles with smaller audience (Seattle), expanding to a larger audience might not be the answer.  It might be smart to address your idea or how you're pitching it.<p>All that being said, SF looks pretty cool. :-)",1191542408

7344098,comment,7343477,7343477,18,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"I was the one at Adtuitive who chose Cascading.JRuby. It was a pre-existing DSL on top of Cascading. It needed some work, but it was a pretty nice concise way to generate Cascading jobs. However, with half a dozen to a dozen people hacking features into it over time at Etsy, and with no real design coordination, things got pretty out of hand. There were a couple of fundamental problems:<p>1. Type system mismatch. Ruby is dynamic and not type checked; Java is static and type checked; Cascading is somewhere in between and unfortunately doesn&#x27;t seem to use Java&#x27;s type system as well as it could.<p>2. User-defined functions in strings. For some reason Cascading lets you write user-defined functions as strings and compiles them dynamically during job execution. This was <i>the</i> way to write user-defined code in Cascading.JRuby.<p>Cascading requires a compilation step, yet since you&#x27;re writing Ruby code, you get get none of the benefits of static type checking. It was standard to discover a type issue only after kicking off a job on, oh, 10 EC2 machines, only to have it fail because of a type mismatch. And user code embedded in strings would regularly fail to compile – which you again wouldn&#x27;t discover until after your job was running.<p>Each of these were bad individually, together, they were a fucking nightmare. The interaction between the code in strings and the type system was the worst of all possible worlds. No type checking, yet incredibly brittle, finicky and incomprehensible type errors at run time. I will never forget when one of my friends at Etsy was learning Cascading.JRuby and he couldn&#x27;t get a type cast to work. I happened to know what would work: a triple cast. You had to cast the value to the type you wanted, not once, not twice, but THREE times.<p>Scalding fixes both problems since it is statically typed and lets you write real user-defined functions instead of stuffing them in strings. To me, the main moral is never, ever design an API that involves writing code in strings. It&#x27;s just bound to be a disaster. Also, if you&#x27;re going to have a compilation step anyway, you might as well get some static checking for obvious problems like type errors as part of the bargain.",1393976660

For the second, if there&#x27;s something systemically keeping women out of tech startups, that&#x27;s a problem the <i>world</i> needs to fix.<p>Assuming that VCs always pick the most promising startup founders without discrimination, the next question is would everyone rather VCs fund unprepared or unqualified founders in order to be more inclusive and look better from a PC standpoint, or pick the best founders that come in front of them and accept that there may not be a diverse mix of people at the company?<p>It&#x27;s really easy to prove that they&#x27;re not funding female founders.

Caffeine is a stimulant, and generally speaking, it has a host of positive effects on your processing speed, alertness, etc. Coffee may even have long-term positive effects there, though the evidence is inconclusive. Additionally, it might be neuroprotective.<p>There have been conflicting and sometimes contradictory reports on coffee&#x27;s effects on cancer, cardiovascular disease, etc. Many studies suggest coffee has anticancer properties; other studies suggest it promotes certain types of cancer. Same thing with arteriosclerosis.<p>In terms of dependency, caffeine has been shown pretty conclusively to be habit-forming and dependence-forming. Almost anyone who&#x27;s been a longtime coffee drinker and quits cold turkey will experience the side effects. But it&#x27;s not clear whether coffee is doing you long-term harm, long-term good, or some combination of the two that nets out to being positive, negative, or neutral.<p>For my part, I&#x27;ve been drinking coffee every day since junior high. My stance is that it&#x27;s been a net-positive in my life, regardless of what price I may pay later on. But that&#x27;s one man&#x27;s opinion. Not a scientific observation.<p>Also worth noting: coffee, marijuana, and alcoholic beverages are complex substances. There are active compounds in coffee other than caffeine. There are active compounds in alcoholic drinks other than ethanol. There are active compounds in weed other than THC. Studies that isolate the effects of any of these compounds aren&#x27;t necessarily indicative of the effects of the substances themselves.",1393974614

The same is true of C99.<p>I think it was mostly Microsoft that was holding C99 adoption back by refusing to support it in their compiler suite (officially, they support C++ and C89/C90 only).  That means you can&#x27;t generally compile C99 code with the Microsoft C/C++ compiler, which meant you had to avoid either that compiler or (if you care about portability) the  C99 standard.

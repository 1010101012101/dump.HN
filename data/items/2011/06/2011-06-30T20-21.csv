I had a potential employer call me in for three multiple hour ""interviews"" during which time they grilled me on how I would handle problem X and design system Y. I was fairly naive because in hindsight it's obvious to me that they didn't want an employee just a free consultation. Smart hack on their part though, and I learned something too.<p>For the right job I'll offer a trial period. Usually a one-two month stint followed up by a buy or fly decision. Play it right and you have a lot of leverage. They just finished training you and you're showing a lot of promise out of the gate. In the managers head they are dreading the idea of having to go through the interview process all over again. The key is not to go looking for people offering unpaid work, but to find people who want to pay and make the buy decision easier.<p>When negotiating keep in mind that you have nothing to lose. If the job is unpaid you gain by leaving. The other side of the table has a lot more at stake. They lose someone they've spent a lot of time/money training, and they have to start over at square one with someone new. Don't underestimate how hard it is to find good people.

2715624,comment,2684620,2685806,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"These days, Postgres is faster than MySQL+InnoDB, and scales much better across multiple CPU cores. (MyISAM is still faster, but that's not an appropriate comparison.)<p>Some features that make Postgres awesome:<p>* Transactional DDL. You can do ""create table"" in a transaction. _Everything_ is transactional, it's not a tacked-on feature, it's the basis of everything.<p>* No legacy cruft. Compared to MySQL, which is filled to the brim with historical warts. The Postgres people have been careful to weed out obsolete functionality. There are essentially no sneaky border cases that a developer needs to be aware of, no weird special cases like ""0000-00-00 00:00"" having special meaning.<p>* No need for a ""strict"" mode, since Postgres is always strict. Postgres doesn't allow invalid dates, doesn't allow byte sequences that violate character encodings, etc. It diligently enforces contraints and generally doesn't allow you to screw up. To Postgres, data integrity is paramount.<p>* PostGIS. Simply awesome. (MySQL's geospatial stuff also tries to implement the OGC API, but last I looked, it was a half-hearted attempt that negelcted to provide the fast R-tree-based (actually GiST-based) indexing that makes PostGIS so super fast.)<p>* Replication. It's late to the party, but I rather prefer how Postgres has implemented its replication, even though it has some downsides where it will abort a long-running query if some data has changed under its feet (but if you're using transactions it's easy to simply restart the query). 9.1 will be getting synchronous replication, which is pretty cool.<p>* Extensions. Postgres can integrate languages like R and Ruby as first-class languages that can be called from SQL. It also has a module system that can extend the type system (a bit of trivia: This was originally the main reason why Michael Stonebraker invented Postgres) with new types, eg. multidimensional matrix columns, or new features, like remote tables.<p>* The ""text"" type. Seriously, why should do people keep writing things like varchar(255)? Postgres' text type is an unlimited string. Unlike MySQL's text type, it can be efficiently indexed without limitations. (Varchar is internally implemented as a bounded text type.)<p>* Cost-based planner backed by row-level statistics. This is the stuff that allows Postgres to do complex nested queries and still perform incredibly well.<p>* Partial indexes. You can do something like ""create index ... on themes (name) where color = 'blue'"". Whenever you do a query that falls within the expressions's range, Postgres will use that index, potentially vastly reducing the search space.<p>* Functional indexes. You can do something like ""create index ... on (lower(name))"". If you then do a query such as ""select ... where lower(name) = 'xyz'"", then Postgres will recognize that it's the same expression, and it will be able to use the index.<p>* Windowing functions and recursive queries, both from ANSI SQL99 iirc. Look this up, they're great.<p>There are some bad points, none of them significant and all of them a matter of taste:<p>- I have never really liked Postgres' text indexing, which feels a bit creaky and antique. At least with 8.x, GIN index updating was slow as hell.<p>- Partitioned tables are a great feature, but I will never use it because of the requirement that one does the plumbing yourself (creating partitioning rules and so on); I keep waiting for something like Oracles's automatic partitioning.<p>- Stored procedures -- ie., running logic inside the database -- feels wrong to me, and always has. For some people this is a requirement, so I'm not really complaining. In some cases, writing a stored procedure can be essential to speed up queries/operations by saving on database roundtrips.<p>- Still no ""upsert"" SQL command (aka ""insert or replace"", ""insert or update"") for asserting the existence of a row atomically.",1309465770

Having an idea for a certain software feature takes only a tiny fraction of the time it takes to implement that feature. So if you're just the ""idea guy"" or even the ""vision guy,"" you're going to be putting in way, way less work than the technical guy.<p>So, what more can you do for the company?

Unless you hire true superstars--whom you probably can't afford--they're not just going to ""take care of it for you."" Getting the most out of hired experts like lawyers and accountants is a skill in itself, and you can easily mess it up. If you're skeptical, just read about all the startups that got into trouble despite (or because of) the advice they received from experts.<p>And that's just one example.

No. Is it a good solution for startups with a small budget who can't afford anything else?  Maybe, but that's for them to decide.<p>No designers are forced to participate in 99 designs, and no companies are forced to use them.  What they do is legal and ethical, so what's the problem?<p>I release all of my photos under a Creative Commons license on Flickr, and I've received comments from professional photographers complaining that my hobby hurts their profession.  So what if it does?  If amateurs are willing to do something for free, then that should encourage professionals to differentiate themselves by being better.  If lowering their prices is also a consequence of that then so be it.<p>It reminds me of people who are against open source software because it competes with people who make and sell software for a living.  Again, should open source groups stop what they're doing out of respect for people who do this for a living?  I don't think they should.  Especially when you realize that most open source contributors <i>are</i> professional developers who make a living building software.<p>I don't mean to disrespect designers at all.  In fact, I have a tremendous amount of respect for great designers, and I've found that you usually get what you pay for when it comes to design.  I wouldn't personally use 99 designs, but I just don't understand the hatred that a lot of people have toward them.<p>P.S. If you're looking for a great designer in the bay area, and you can afford a little more than 99 designs, I recommend Dual Aesthetic. <a href=""http://www.dualaesthetic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dualaesthetic.com/</a>",1309464197

They seem like the Bad News Bears of startups really.  Well, if the Bad News Bears did a bunch of obnoxious things of dubious legality.

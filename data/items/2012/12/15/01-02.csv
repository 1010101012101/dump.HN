This means man in the middle attacks are possible.<p>If you don't know what that means: this is one step before not using SSL at all. Without SSL, everyone intercepting your traffic can read it. With SSL, but without certificate validation (the app accepts any certificate presented to it), you have to pretend to be the server (intercept the traffic to it; there are several ways to do this and it depends on weather you are using g3, wifi or what ever. But running your own DNS or DHCP server with custom features on an open wlan is certainly one of them) and get to see what the client sends. You can forward the clients requests to the real server, if you like, but the client will have no idea it is not communicating with the real server either way.<p>I'd say this is worth fixing and my first knee-jerk reaction would have been to just spill the beans.

4924272,comment,4923971,4924023,10,0,mistercow,,,"> even a poorly implemented autoscroll is an order of magnitude improvement over the UX experience it replaces.<p>I completely disagree. The <i>best possible</i> implementation of infinite scroll is better than pagination, but <i>most</i> infinite scroll implementations are worse to me than pagination.<p>First of all, the main problem I have with multi-page web sites is not that I have to click a ""next"" button. That's such a minor inconvenience that it doesn't even register. The main annoyance with arbitrary pagination is that you can't easily search the page. Infinite scroll helps with that, but simply having a single page per chunk of related data (i.e. one page for a blog post) works better.<p>Secondly, with pagination, or with an ordinary non-infinite single page layout, I can close my browser tab and reopen it, restart my computer, reload the page, whatever, and when I come back, it will be scrolled right there in the same place. I have never seen an infinite scroll implementation that could do that.<p>Finally, bad implementations of infinite scroll just let the page grow and grow, consuming resources without end. Especially on sites that have a lot of images, this creates a practical limit to how far you can scroll before the site becomes unusable. Even if the site offers an multi-page alternative layout, you then have to find your place again at that time.",1355535479

If someone built python with current-day emscripten it should be much faster.<p>There is a better way, though. We could compile PyPy's generated C implementation and add a JIT to JS to that. That would be the best way to get fast python into the browser. If anyone is interested to hack on that let me know, I would assist from the emscripten side.<p>Note though that this would only give throughput speed, not startup speed. For startup speed, a method like pyjamas or bython will do better - at the cost of not fully supporting the python language, of course.",1355535465

If something like this happened in Russia (or ""somewhere""), and somehow the US didn't know about it, they would have jets up in the air and the whole country put on red alert as soon as they find out about a rocket being launched, I expect. Does SpaceX have to send letters out to the major nations of the world, or something? Or have I got all this out of movies and there's no real way to track recently launched missiles?",1217731245

265344,comment,265136,265279,0,0,13ren,,,"I agree: don't make the concept/idea patentable, only the specific implementation. The specific light bulb; the specific telegraphy system.<p>OTOH, I kinda like the idea of Segway owning the concept - it was a cool idea, and a lot of work to pull it off.  But I don't like the world that owning concepts so generally would create. I think it's good to encourage many people to search for ways to do it, and they get to own what they find. If someone finds the best way, they win big. I think that's great.<p>I find it interesting that Morse's original patent seemed pretty much along the lines you say - but then, several years later, he tried to amend it to cover <i>any</i> way of accomplishing telegraphy. The courts upheld the original, but not the amendment (if memory serves). The amendment seems to be the style of patenting software today.<p>I see no reason, in principle, why patent law can not operate in the same way in the software world as it does for mechanical systems - despite software being more abstract.",1217730685

It was against Comcast's truly evil reset packets - basically, against Comcast's forged traffic.  It is a very good thing that the FCC has taken a stand against ISPs forging traffic to disrupt people's internet connection.  However, I would caution against statements like the NYTimes article has saying that the FCC has come out against ""equipment that slowed - but did not completely block - file transfers using BitTorrent"".  This wasn't mere traffic shaping or throttling in the Comcast case.",1217730414

1272852,comment,1271933,1272359,0,0,rimantas,,,"Sorry, but if you knew what you are talking about, you would not call a parser with callbacks a compiler with VM. Maybe SAX parsers are also compilers and run some VM?
What does parsed CSS selector compile to? Where is that VM and what does it run? Bytecode?<p>Sizzle is just a parser what parses given selector into parts, gets matchin DOM elements, filters them and returns what matches. There is no compilation or virtual machines involved, just some string parsing, callbacks and DOM API.",1271497068

They enable people (i.e.: you and me) to do great stuff, without <i>getting</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>way</i>. Stuff like programming and writing and designing.<p>An Apple product - to the average end-user - is an abstraction layer to all those <i>other</i> things. If the abstraction layer works, use it. If it doesn't, don't. Baggage has nothing to do with it.",1271496374

Thanks in no small part to Zuckerberg himself, the next great wave of software engineers and entrepreneurs who we admire, respect, and study will have surely done something stupid on the internet. Or maybe they made an ugly website. People learning make mistakes. They produce shoddy work. But doing work is how you learn.<p>We should encourage aspiring hackers to launch their careers early, collect feedback, and iterate on themselves... even if that means someone is going to mock them for trying.",1271495993

They were so awful that musician X had to sing along so the vocalist could hear it in the monitor to get close enough to the pitch so the auto tuner could make something that didn't sound like a robot.  After seeing that, I am no longer surprised at the state of any recent music recordings or compositions.  I first noticed the massive over-use of compression in the mid-90's, and it's only gotten worse since then.",1271495121

The only active non-XUL Gecko application is Camino, the rest died several years ago or switched to webkit, and Camino's been threatening to do one of those too.<p>GCC was architected by Stallman to be intentionally inextensible, as a means of enforcing their interpretation of the GPL through technical means, by denying access to intermediate representations.

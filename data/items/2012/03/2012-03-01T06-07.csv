<a href=""http://xkcd.com/606/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/606/</a><p>This points out one more factor: content prices decrease dramatically after several years. Videogames go from $60 to $10 on Steam; Movies end up in discount bins; books end up cheap on amazon or from used bookstores.<p>Books are an interesting example: when they are first published it is difficult to acquire them at a local library (because lots of other people want to read the same new book), but after some time (usually much less than a year), they are easily acquirable for free. <i>If</i> the library model works, such that authors are satisfied with the profitability of writing books, then reducing copyright term to a few years 
is probably reasonable.<p>EDIT: I personally think somewhere around 10 years is probably more reasonable, but I think the discussion around a more extreme 2-5 years is interesting, and the current term length is ridiculous.",1330584962

Writers of long novels use special writer software to keep track of which characters interact with what others, to create family charts, friend charts, event timelines, etc.<p>These don't replace text, they augment it.

Similarly, the relationship of the iPhone to its predecessor phones is tighter than you think. Almost all of the traits that made the iPhone what it is were present in the predecessor population of smartphones.<p>In particular, I'd say the iPhone is what you get if you cross two specific devices and add the mutation of capacitive multi-touch (and the inevitable march of Moore's Law, of course). Those two devices are:<p>1. the O2 XDA (full touch screen, no keyboard, ""enhanced"" browser with desktop-like ambitions [even if it was Pocket IE])
2. the Danger Hiptop (consumer focused device with similar built-in apps, centralized app download catalog / store)<p>Those ancestors were chosen quite carefully, of course.

All of the dominant internet companies exhibit this kind of nonsensical ""evil"" behavior:  Google, eBay, Apple and Paypal, to name the most salient examples.<p>Way back when, Microsoft was openly painted by Apple (and the Apple cult followers) as being evil.  Interestingly enough, Microsoft never sought to have this kind of a death grip on its users, at least not by force.  And, I've never heard of MS killing-off someone's revenue stream like that.  You buy their tools and develop for the platform.  They don't have a say at all.  That's the way it should be.<p>Somehow a united front needs to be organized and presented to these companies in order for them to understand that they are causing serious damage.<p>To say that, as entrepreneurs, businessmen and developers we don't want to see the tech landscape develop and evolve in this manner is probably an understatement.<p>I wonder if CNBC might be interested in doing a documentary on the damage to small businesses and entrepreneurs done by the likes of Google, Apple, eBay and Paypal?

It is flexible, expressive, and fast.  Its dynamicity comes in very handy.  And some of its vices -- its sheer size, its lack of orthogonality, and its occasionally archaic naming conventions -- are much less problematic for a language implementation task than they are for general programming.<p>There are exceptions, of course.  You wouldn't want to implement C++ in Common Lisp.  But for dynamically typed languages it ought to be a leading candidate.",1330582566

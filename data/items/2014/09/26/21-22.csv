He specified that he was going to be chewing through large datasets, so the dual Xeons @2.3GHz were important to him. Synologies are great for what they do, but underpowered for CPU/RAM-intensive tasks...at least in the sub $500 range, which is what he was looking to spend.<p>I&#x27;m a happy Synology owner, but I don&#x27;t use it for my dev server. It sits behind my VPN and serves media files. With the variable speed drives (WD Green) and ARM chip, it draws very little power. In short, I love it for the specific purpose for which it was designed, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for much else. My dev server is in AWS. It&#x27;s just too easy to spin up and spin down whenever I need it and keeps me from having to devote space in my apartment (SF aint cheap!). Also, not having a hefty power bill is nice.<p>If I were advising the story author, I&#x27;d tell him that unless part of the enjoyment is building and running the thing, he should opt for a cloud provider instead. He could get a DO droplet spec&#x27;d beyond the physical server he bought for $0.12/hr and spin it up whenever he wanted to use it. Unless he&#x27;s planning on using it almost continuously, you can fit a lot of 12-cent hours into a $310 budget, and that&#x27;s before you consider the increased energy usage from running a server at home.",1411768554

But because the remote is going through a satellite, there is a feed back delay, say 1 second or so. So when he tries to compensate for a wrong turn, a flavor of PIO is induced and the ship crashes.\nThink that particular story was written in the 40&#x27;s, good foresight of Mr. Clarke.",1411767824

The last thing you want to do at that point is share test sequencing code, since it&#x27;s so easy to subvert the flow in other tests using it by mistake.<p>It&#x27;s a hard argument to make, because everyone gets SPOT, yo, Fowler rules, etc. They aren&#x27;t wrong, but it really only applies when the interface is everything and how you fulfill the interface is irrelevant.<p>For some types of code--frame-accurate games being one, tests being another--the order of events is paramount. IMO, even mature patterns like Selenium&#x27;s Page Object Model gets this one wrong by encouraging test flow code to live in POM methods.<p>There are absolutely times where optimizing for understandability and being paranoid about implementation changes is the way to go.",1411767088

8374944,comment,8374345,8374345,11,0,tgb,,,"I&#x27;m not a professional programmer and I rarely work with large code bases. So the fact that my code has drifted steadily over the years towards the large-main-function I thought was a factor of several things, first being my general amateurism. I still think that, but there are definitely other reasons too: I now use more expressive languages (Python instead of C) and more expressive idioms within those languages (list comprehensions instead of while loops) and more expressive structures/libraries (NumPy instead of lists of structures), so I can afford to put more in one spot.  I also write smaller but more numerous programs.<p>But there are very real advantages. I learned through game programming and still do some for fun and I absolutely prefer having a main loop that puts its fingers into all the components of the game than to have a main loop which delegates everything to mysterious entity.update()-style functions. The lack of architecture allows me to structure the logic of the game more clearly for exactly the reasons Carmack outlines. Everything is sequenced - what has already happened in the frame can be seen by scrolling up a bit instead of digging through a half-dozen files.<p>But the real win here is for the beginner programmer. I strongly dislike the trend these days towards programming education being done in a &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; manner where the student takes an existing framework and writes a number of functions. The problem is that the student rarely has any idea what the framework is doing. I would rather not have beginners write games by make on_draw(), on_tick(), etc. functions but much rather have them write a for loop and have to call gfx_library_init() at program start and gfx_library_swap_buffers() at the end of a frame. That way they can say &quot;The program starts here and steps through these lines and then exits here&quot; versus having magic frameworks do the work for them. There is plenty of magic done these days behind the scenes for any beginner, but it is too much to have a completely opaque flow-control.",1411766455

This is a general term for situations when the pilot makes inputs to stabilize an airplane, but the inputs instead end up exacerbating the instability. A simple example of how this could happen is if the control inputs for some reason take effect with a time delay: the airplane pitches up, so the pilot tries to push it down, after a moment the transient passes and the plane pitches down so the pilots pulls up, but the previous input amplifies the downwards movement so the pilot pulls up harder, etc.<p>Several of the first  generation of unstable fly-by-wire airplanes had problems with PIO. Unlike conventional aircrafts, where the rudder positions exactly follow the position of the stick, here the desired rudder position is calculated as the sum of two inputs, one calculated from the stick position, and one calculated by flight control software to dampen instabilities.<p>Early versions of the software was &quot;rate limited&quot;, i.e. at each iteration of the main loop the software calculates the desired rudder position and then moves the rudders towards that position at the fastest rate the rudder actuators allow. However, that leads to problems when there are very large transient stick inputs: because the rudders take some time to move, the largest rudder deflection occurs with some delay after the largest stick input (see figure 6 in [1]).<p>In the 1993 crash there was a wind gust causing a pitch movement, and both the pilot and the flight control software provided a compensation. The sum of the two signals was big enough to hit the rate-limitation, so the response of the airplane was strange, the pilot gave several more large inputs, and there was PIO.<p>Incidentally, one of the YF-22 prototypes crashed for basically the same reason, even though they run different software. The solution was to develop some new &quot;phase compensation&quot; methods for designing controllers [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=558586&tag=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=558586&...</a>",1411766345

You have a rate or a salary and are paid according to that. It&#x27;s pretty straight-forward.<p>With Soothe or any tip-driven service (in the US, that includes waiting tables, cab driving, barbers, and a host of other service jobs), there&#x27;s a significant amount of subjectivity that determines your income.<p>If you do well, you&#x27;re tipped well. On just a regular $50 dinner here in the States, I can tip anywhere from $5 to $15 depending on how satisfied I am with the waitress&#x27; service.<p>But what if the restaurant took responsibility for the waitress&#x27; tips? It wants to maximize its profits. Chances are it&#x27;s not going to pay $15 or even $10 for each table...it&#x27;s going to pay a lot less.<p>How much less? I contend it will pay the least it can before it starts running into talent problems.<p>That rate, whatever it is, assuming the waitress is good, MUST be less than the average customer would pay in tips. The restaurant sees all its waitresses as good, so it can&#x27;t pay any one more than the other. That would be unfair and illegal.<p>Customers can. And they would pay more for good service. That&#x27;s why, I think, on average, at least here in the States, a tipped employee does worse when working for a company like Soothe.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a study on this topic for Uber et al to see what&#x27;s really happening.",1411765623

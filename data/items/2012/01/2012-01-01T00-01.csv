The entire point of it was it's not as bad as you would think, and it's getting better.""</i><p>It's still quite bad -- the 2.0 benchmark shows a dropoff of 1000 read qps with as few as 60 faults per second.  The 1.8 metrics drop to damn near zero reads under the same scenario.  That's obviously worse, but a 33% drop in read capacity for 60 faults/sec is bad, no matter how you look at it.<p>Another way of thinking about it:  if you're throwing 3,000 qps at a mongo instance, and expecting <i>only</i> 60 faults/s, then you need to ensure that 2940/3000 (98%) of your working set fits in RAM.  Maybe there are toy problems where that's true as the DB grows to terabytes of persistent storage, but there aren't very many.",1325379528

When I was just starting the learn the ins-and-outs of programming, I liked the rigidity and direction that classes offered and thus, I did the more formal internship path vs a self-study.<p>It also depends on the specific internship you hypothetically take - they can vary wildly. A good, established internship program can be invaluable and provide things you can't get studying on your own (team skills, client interaction, mentorship) - but on the other side of the coin you could end up with the repetitive busy work that you are worried about.<p>Also consider that you can always work on your own stuff even with an internship (assuming it's cool with your company w.r.t IP) - this path is probably the most work but likely to be the most effective.",1325379506

Which means that none of this is really relevant.<p>Except that now with that new graph showing such good performance on reads during paging people are going to get confused.<p>Anyway you can get 32GB of RAM for $232 or 48GB for $636.  Which means that for 90% of applications, you actually don't need to shard.  And if the journaling works (people with a vested interest in relational systems really have to hope that it doesn't), then I don't have to worry about my data disappearing, even if I only have one database server, which is also not a recommended design with MongoDB (or any database really).<p>I have years of experience with SQL Server, Oracle and MySQL. However, MongoDB is the most attractive database now because it makes the object-relational impedance mismatch go away.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mis...</a><p>If I can write code (in CoffeeScript using a library like Mongolian Deadbeef) like this<p><pre><code>    posts.insert

then whey would I want to deal with separate steps of setting up the relational database tables, creating stored procedures, creating a software layer to map my objects to my tables etc., or hiring a DBA?<p>I believe that most of the hate for MongoDB is fueled by a survival instinct.  The popularity of databases like MongoDB threaten to make years of experience obsolete and threaten the existence of the DBA profession.  Relational databases are great, but they were an optimization designed to solve certain problems that most people today just don't have, and now they have become an unfortunate institutionalized dogma.",1325379303

That aspect of programming was one that I’ve long been interested in but have never found any lever for coming close to in my experience with languages of the FORTRAN, ALGOL, PL/I school. It was clear in those languages that programming was really an exercise in plumbing.""<p>This quote by Perlis from the article sounds eerily similar to some of the stuff written about Lisp over the last decade. Perhaps there's something to be gained by combining the concepts of Lisp/Scheme/Clojure and APL/K/J together.

(Also nicer since it won't beep in terminals that don't support it.)<p>The ""0;"" means ""set both icon and window title""; you can also make this ""1;"" to set the icon title only (i.e. when minimized) and ""2;"" to set the window title only (i.e. when not minimized).  For example:<p><pre><code>  printf ""\033]1;icon title\033\\"
  printf ""\033]2;window title\033\\"

If your terminal supports this, you'll see ""icon title"" when the window is minimized (e.g. in the Dock on Mac OS X) and ""window title"" otherwise.<p>If you want to do this in any Bourne-compatible shell and not just ""bash"", try omitting the ""function"" word.  And if your system does not have an ""echo"" that supports these options, see if the ""printf"" command is available and use that instead.  For example:<p><pre><code>  settitle() {
    printf ""\033]0;$1\033\\"

They have in fact put a lot of thought into it, they simply made decisions that you either do not understand, or happen to disagree with.<p>Nobody at 10gen is arguing that a global write lock is the best idea in the world. They are acutely aware of the drawbacks. They <i>initially</i> implemented it that way because it significantly reduces the complexity of offering concurrency in the first place. There's a reason that a NoSQL solution with more granular locking doesn't exist yet. It's much more difficult to construct. There is an ongoing, documented, transparent effort to migrate toward more granular locking, but that is <i>hard</i> and takes time. In the meantime, they have been working on mitigating the drawbacks of their decision by aggressively yielding whenever possible during long running operations.<p>Did you even read the article? Did you look at the benchmarks? The entire point of it was <i>it's not as bad as you would think, and it's getting better</i>.",1325376921

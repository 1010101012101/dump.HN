If you have any particular problem, feel free to email me (address should be in the repo); and if you have success running Odin on Windows, I'd be very interested in hearing that too.<p>Re hybridauth: using different identity providers is somewhere between ""it's possible"" and ""it would be nice to have"" priority, unless we actually need it. The idea is to have the SSO for the <i>internal</i> services, and hybridauth seems to be focused on end user and social authentication. Also, Hybridauth itself is PHP; while in principle it should be possible to implement the authorizer app in any language, I'd prefer to keep it in Perl until there's a really, really good reason to switch.<p>If I work on option on different identity providers, it will still be rather focused on internal services use case than end-user social authentication use case.

First, it requires team members to register every single browser they'll be using to access the panels  which may also mean being locked out during emergency due to not having a blessed browser nearby.<p>As I understand the scheme, distributing and deleting/changing clients' public keys to the web servers is basically the same challenge as syncing htpasswd across servers and trying to let users change their passwords. Syncing itself is not an issue, but making it possible (and EASY - any security that gets in the way of getting the job done will be circumvented by users themselves) to add / update / invalidate user's certs by users themselves is not trivial.<p>It also adds to the proliferation of credentials: Yet Another Key (or even Set of Keys) is just as bad as Yet Another Login And Password.<p>This is a good idea for a multi-factor authentication, though: require either token / SMS OTP / other out-of-band verification, or a blessed client certificate  basically, pre-authorize certain browsers.

For instance, you may not wrap your customer data behind a class and methods, but there are still going to be some rules related to all that data you're passing around.

4385331,comment,4382324,4382701,1,0,mpasternacki,,,"Thank you for your remarks, this is really helpful.<p>It doesn't seem to me that timing attack is feasible here: timing of comparison of a relatively short string vs network latency and everything else that happens during Apache's request handling would require a lot of repeated attempts and statistical analysis of very noisy data if it's at all possible to get meaningful results. Still, it's better to be on the safe side and I'm going to close it up.<p>Sanity check for idea of resolution: adding a random length sleep, 1 to 3 seconds, if HMAC is invalid. This would fuzz the small timing difference in string comparison, and at the same time tarpit any exploit attempts (invalid HMAC is more likely to be sign of manipulation attempt rather than a honest error). Does that make any sense?<p>Regarding user-controlled data: the context here is that usernames aren't under user's full control (they need to be entered into Google Apps by someone, and also validated). In general case this is a valid issue - a valid login could break the scheme here.<p>This is in no way an excuse, but rather explanation of my reasoning: the initial idea was to port GodAuth and be at least ""kind of compatible"", because some people use GodAuth and it might be meaningful for interoperability. Also, as I'm no specialist in crypto (as you can clearly see), I followed the route of not touching crypto-related code that is already written. The issues you've found are strong enough reasons to diverge from GodAuth - especially that GodAuth interoperability is way more theoretical than an actual security issue even if it may not be exploitable.

That means that on paper this is an abuse of the asylum process (and one which as a result actually damages it) so it's possible or even probable that the UK government will decline to grant him passage to Ecuador which leaves him exactly where he is now - in the embassy in London with no way to get out.<p>One thing I don't understand is the idea that the US want him in Sweden so they can extradite him to the US from there. Why not just extradite him from the UK? The UK has a very favourable extradition policy, the government are supportive of the US and likely to be more sympathetic than Sweden. It just makes no sense to me. Yes things can get tied up in the UK courts but I doubt that's different to Sweden.",1345026090

I'm not a big fan of the right-to-left panel layout, but it's not a deal breaker. It makes my life easier, which is what I want in a software package.<p>I love the design of Trello and could possibly move to that, but I'd miss the scheduling/velocity/estimating features.

Why some OS doesn't just embrace djbware I'll never understand.  It compiles, smoothly, in seconds.  (There's no need for distributing binaries.)  And the chances of the author initiating lawsuits (as some Linux foundations are known to do), over something placed in the ""public domain"" are close to nil. He's got better things to do.<p>BSD's rc system is fine.  Sometimes the scripts are too verbose.  But the whole idea is the system is simple enough to understand that you can write your own scripts -- more concisely, if you wish.  You don't need to read a book (e.g. Linux from Scratch), keep most things disabled by default and let the user turn stuff on as they need it.<p>I recently used Debian's live USB, the rescue version, for a little while and was amazed at how much stuff is turned on by default.  I guess if you understand each and every choice that's been made for you it's OK.  But if not, that approach is not very conducive to learning.<p>As for Apple, never mind all the XML fluff, good luck trying to understand what's going on behind the scenes with their computers anymore.

4385295,comment,4382214,4382590,3,0,_delirium,,,"Traditionally, the public literature is how scientists communicated, which is what made republication possible in the first place. Lab A, perhaps in Germany, works on a research project, and gets some results. They write up their methodology and results, and communicate them to other scientists by publishing the write-up in a journal. The journal will have the write-up peer-reviewed before publishing it, but that doesn't mean verifying it's <i>correct</i>, only that it's a contribution to the scientific literature worth communicating to its readership. For example, it would make sure the paper has done appropriate data analysis, has cited relevant existing work, is not outright kookery, etc.<p>Now other scientists, anywhere in the world, will read this and decide what they think of it, which may include attempting to replicate it. If they find different results, or have a qualm with an interpretation or methodology, they can write a response, which will also (after peer-review) be communicated by the journal to its readership, either as another paper, or if shorter, as a letter. Thus the back-and-forth of claim/replication/critique happens, all in the open air of the journal's pages, with any lab anywhere in the world able to follow the conversation and jump in if they wish.<p>To me that's more transparent than doing all this in some kind of closed pre-publication process. Perhaps in the modern era, the open communication doesn't necessarily have to happen in journals anymore: perhaps it should happen on arXiv, and journals should become more conservative in what they publish. But I would like it to still be public.",1345025365

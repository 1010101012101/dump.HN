To ignore that positive effect just because you notice a subtle and possibly true behavioral shift is short-sighted.<p>My humble opinion is that most people are self-aware enough to know the externalization of their lives is detrimental on the large scale.

From the MSDN article:<p>""If the client specifies a value type, then the JIT compiler replaces the generic type parameters in the IL with the specific value type, and compiles it to native code. However, the JIT compiler keeps track of type-specific server code it already generated. If the JIT compiler is asked to compile the generic server with a value type it has already compiled to machine code, it simply returns a reference to that server code. Because the JIT compiler uses the same value-type-specific server code in all further encounters, there is no code bloating.""<p>So .NET has chosen number 2 with duplicate elimination:<p>""This slows compilation. It generates a lot of code, much of it redundant, and needs a good linker to eliminate duplicate copies.

That's a good thing, it helps improve the startup.<p>But ""government money"" is really my money, and you're proposing that the government force me to fund startups that have been unable to secure angel investment. To be blunt, this seems really lame. I'd rather keep my money that I've worked hard for and invest it into my own ventures.<p>[I should also note this is a debate of principles for me: I'm not saying ""oh in my opinion startups aren't worth my tax dollars"", so much as ""government is inefficient at everything, and $PROPOSAL is a subset of everything, therefore, government shouldn't be $PROPOSAL when another solution already exists."", where $PROPOSAL = 'funding startups' in this instance.]",1365079126

I don't think they take anything seriously, but it's not necessarily a flaw.<p>By the way, Hexen II initially had a different name. The game was later re-branded to Hexen II. This explains why so few things connect Hexen II and the other games, and why the setting is so generic medieval fantasy complete with Devil as the main opponent.<p>The 3rd game in the trilogy was meant to be Hecatomb.\n<a href=""http://www.johnromero.com/wiki/index.php/Hecatomb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johnromero.com/wiki/index.php/Hecatomb</a><p>Another bit of trivia - Heresiarch from Hexen was initially meant to be the final boss. Check out the ending animation of Heretic. And Korax looks more like D'sparil's mount, not a boss. I read somewhere that was the original plan and they've changed it over the course of development.<p>Hexen, while a game with deep flaws (extreme switch hunting and ""haha, you're stuck!"" puzzles, repetitive combat, lack of class diversity, lame instadeath traps with no warning) is a game with charm. I made a gameplay mod for it, but then realized nobody cares about the game anymore and stopped developing it. If you're interested in it, I can send you the latest (unfinished) version. Highlights include:<p>- Disc of Repulsion actually pulls enemies closer and down (flyers) if you're a warrior<p>- Hammer of Retribution is a huge mana hog, but is reusable because it produces 20(depends on difficulty setting) mana where it hits. This was done to change the playstyle of Warrior class to be more in-your-face while still allowing him to kill enemies at a distance.<p>- Quietus, the 4th Warrior weapon, has a railgun-like effect meaning projectiles pierce multiple enemies. This finally gave it a niche and it's a great weapon against swarms up close.<p>- spiked gauntlets (fists) only have strong punches (called ""critical hit"" in the engine) for finishing blows.<p>- flechette items work more like grenades and require good timing, they explode 1 second after first bounce<p>- sapphire wand of Mage is severely nerfed in range to make room for other weapons.<p>- Frost Shards deal 50% more damage<p>- Bloodscourge (4th mage weapon) overhauled. Each projectile is guaranteed to home on a different enemy. Second, it deals extreme explosive damage, especially to the user. With Hexen's cramped level design, it makes it THE best weapon in the open and extremely dangerous in corridors. I also modified the homing algorithm, now it has no problem hitting enemies on high ledges. And a cosmetic effect - big clouds of smoke. Tim the Enchanter would LOVE it.<p>- Wraithverge (cleric's 4th weapon) no longer attacks inactive enemies through walls, which used to wake half of the level and was obnoxious. Additionally, instead of killing enemies outright, it reduces them to 1 HP. Nice synergy with mace. Ghost AI makes them ignore crippled enemies.<p>Monsters: \n- afrits (fire imps) have short-ranged flamethrower with interesting projectile physics.<p>- stalkers (water lurkers) have very mean and currently unbalanced attack where they grab and immobilize you when they emerge. Any hit will break the grab.<p>- fixed obnoxious bugs with Dark Bishop and Stalker Leader which caused them to attempt shooting through walls (sent the patch upstream)<p>The goal of the mod was to make enemies and weapons more varied and interesting, and to challenge a modern FPS player. It utilizes the obscure Vavoom source port, which is technically very advanced, has engine written in a scripting language, but is unfortunately quite buggy and poorly documented. I had some more ideas I wanted to implement, such as alternate effect for Chaos Device (shuffles positions of all monsters on the level using Knuth's algorithm). Overall, I love how the 4th weapons of Cleric, Warrior and Mage turned out, they're now a joy to play with (especially mage).",1365078850

Often times that is not good enough in a real program. You can't handle the error, since you don't know what function call it came from, so you're probably just logging it and swallowing it.<p>It also means that you don't know how much of your code executed. Have you written that file to disk yet? Maybe you need to clean it up now? Is that socket still open? or maybe you didn't get that far in the code?<p>In code that cares about handling errors, you end up with a lot of try/catches around individual functions that you know can throw... this is no different than go's if err != nil code.<p><pre><code>  try {\n    v = ThisCanThrow()\n  } catch (Exception ex) {\n    // handle this specific failure\n  }\n\n  v, err := ThisCanError()\n  if err != nil {\n    // handle this specific failure\n  }\n</code></pre>\nBecause Go forces you to handle the error at the site where it is produced, error handling ends up being much more robust and specific.

They don't have a single platform, they have 4 (android 1.5, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.1) so developers have no way to hit everyone. They don't have a sound library worth a crap, their video player isn't much better, and they don't have a viable in app purchase model (although they have something good enough that it will prevent them from really making a real in app purchase API a la Apple).

If a partition occurs you may not be able to get a quorum (where R + W > N) and, again, you're stuck with either being unavailable or potentially inconsistent. There's really no way around it... AFAIK it's a logical impossibility.<p>I'm not sure I get your argument re: CAP being overapplied. The key point the whole ""AP"" camp is making is exactly what you're saying - ""just because some fraction of your nodes are offline, that doesn't mean the whole system is offline."" What it does mean, though, is that some of your data may be stale. But eventually it won't be.<p>As for WAN partitions, I agree, they're not as frequent as single node failures. But as far as CAP is concerned it doesn't really matter. A partition is a partition, whether it's one node or half your cluster. The frequency that ""WAN partitions"" occurs depends on how you define a ""WAN partition."" If you consider a single lost TCP connection a short-lived partition (it pretty much is), or if you consider a DNS or power outage a WAN partition (in the sense that a whole cluster might disappear) then I think we can all come up with lots of ways WAN partitions can and do occur.

1248040,comment,1247922,1247922,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""Wozniak's design was open and decentralized in ways that still define those concepts in the computing industries. The original Apple had a hood, and as with a car, the owner could open it up and get at the guts of the machine. Although it was a fully assembled device, not a kit like earlier PC products, Apple owners were encouraged to tinker with the innards of Wozniak's machine—to soup it up, make it faster, add features. There were slots to accommodate all sorts of peripheral devices, and it was built to run a variety of software. Wozniak's ethic of openness also extended to disclosing design specifications. In a 2006 talk at Columbia University, he put the point this way: ""Everything we knew, you knew."" To point out that this is no longer Apple's policy is to state the obvious.""<p>I suspect the resurrection of this vision is what will begin the fightback against Apple's closed universe vision. If I could get the same (or better) hardware, with roughly the same formfactor as the IPad with a lot of connectors and a completely hackable software stack for a decent price, that would be awesome. The only competition shaping up on the hardware front seems to be HP's  slate. Maybe I should buy one and install Linux (or something else) on it when it comes out.<p>(If I am wrong correct me, what is a good tablet that competes with the IPad?) I would love to see something built around an ARM processor for e.g. but building hardware is a lot tougher than in Woz's days. As a thought experiment if just the hardware part of the IPod were available for say 350 $ or so it wasn't closed and were completely open like the original Apple so we could hack whatever on it, how many of us would buy one? I would. If i had the harware chops i'd build and sell this myself.<p>Linux is awesome but there isn't a competing (with the IPad) hardware platform to run it on. Hopefully some one  will have the cojones and talent to go up against Apple soon. Remember, once Microsoft was the unstoppable juggernaut who were on track to dominate all of computing.<p>I hope to live to see the day of the withering of Apple.",1270665440

There is enough redundancy engineered into today’s WANs that a partition is quite rare ... the most likely WAN failure is to separate a small portion of the network from the majority. In this case, the majority can continue with straightforward algorithms, and only the small portion must block. Hence, it seems unwise to give up consistency all the time in exchange for availability of a small subset of the nodes in a fairly rare scenario.""<p>That last sentence is a very strong put-down of NoSQL; if it wasn't published on the ACM website, it should have a ""zing!"" at the end of it.",1270664278

1247981,comment,1247713,1247713,0,0,mmalone,,,"I posted this comment to the ACM article, but they're pre-moderating and apparently someone's shirking their responsibilities... so I'm reposting here. Hope you guys don't mind:<p>Hey Michael,<p>Interesting read. I'm with you on most points. I do have a couple comments though...<p>Failure mode 1 is an application error.<p>Failure mode 2 should result in a failed write. It shouldn't be too hard to trap errors programmatically and handle them intelligently / not propagate them. Of course the devil's in the details and hardware / interpreter / other problems in components that are outside of the DBs control can make things more difficult. These are the sorts of issues that tend to stick around until a system is ""battle tested"" and run in a couple of large / high volume operations.<p>Failure modes 3, 4, 5, 6 (partition in a local cluster) - this seems to be where the meat of your argument is... but you totally gloss over your solution. I'm not sure I believe that network partitions (even single node failures) are easily survived by lots of algorithms... Or, more specifically, I don't believe that they can be survived while maintaining consistency (in the CAP sense, not the ACID sense). I threw together a super simplified ""proof"" of why consistency is essentially impossible in this situation in a recent talk. See <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/mmalone/scaling-gis-data-in-nonrelational-data-stores"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/mmalone/scaling-gis-data-in-nonrel...</a> - slides 16 through 20. What algorithms are there to get around this? If a replica is partitioned you either can't replicate to it and have to fail (unavailable) or you can't replicate to it and succeed anyways (replica is inconsistent).<p>I also don't buy the argument that partitions (LAN or WAN) are rare and therefore we shouldn't worry about them. For a small operation this may be true, but when you're doing a million operations a second then a one-in-a-million failure scenario will happen every second.<p>Failure mode 7 will probably result in some data loss unless (as you mention) you're willing to live with the latency of waiting for durable multi-datacenter writes to occur. But having that option is definitely nice, and that's a trade off that I'd like to be able to make on a per-write basis. I may choose to accept that latency when I'm recording a large financial transaction, for example. Another thought related to this issue - in a lot of ways writing something to memory on multiple nodes is more ""durable"" than writing it to disk on one. So you may be able to do multi-DC replicated writes in memory with tolerable latency assuming your DCs are close enough that the speed of light isn't limiting. That should get you durability up to the point where the entire eastern seaboard disappears, at least.<p>Failure mode 8 is another core issue that I think you're glossing over. WAN failures (particularly short-lived ones) can and do happen on a regular basis. It's true that routing issues are typically resolved quickly, but it's another law-of-large-numbers thing. Amazon AWS had an issue that took an entire data center offline a while back, for example. Shit happens. In CAP terms this is really the same thing as a failure modes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 though. So the same arguments apply. Re: your argument that only a small segment splits - what happens when a read comes into the small split segment (maybe from a client in the same datacenter)? If data has been updated on the larger segment it couldn't have been replicated, so again you're either serving stale data or your data store is unavailable.<p>Thanks for putting this together, it was an interesting read. Looking forward to hearing more about some of these issues!",1270664172

Some of the bugs crosses several products, and you have to ""pass on"" the bug to backend server developer Bob when you find out your code is working as intended.  How should you communicate the reported bug and your analysis to Bob?  Assign the bug to him in the tracker, and he will get access to the complete bug history - initial report, discussion, reproduction steps, analysis, why-this-isn't-a-problem-with-module-Q-even-though-it-looks-like-it, new comments, screenshots, log files and configuration file attachments from the customer.

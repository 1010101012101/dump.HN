That question doesn't tell you anything about the candidate's capability of <i>understanding</i> a version control system, which is a far more important property than their particular experience with one VCS or another.<p>This year alone, I've learned at least a half-dozen new tools and technologies that I'd never used in grad school.  Yet here I am, using them to do productive work.  Would you really not hire me because I'd never used a tool before?",1239591308

They want in-the-box thinkers who would never question why they didn't get their raise this year. They want risk-averse programmers caz you can exploit them.<p>2) HN never lied. In probability there are no absolutes. if I or my manaders had to choose between two resumes of equal qualifications all would choose the one with a startup. I doubt any programmer I personally worked with would dissagree(or their manager). However there are exceptions to this rule. Some simply want the workers that work not the workers that think.<p>3) You really don't want to work for them... Do you want to work with people who never act on their dreams or hopes, only whine and complqin and sit down and shut the fuck up about problems at work when it comes to talking to managers or asking for appropriate pay for teir tallent (if they got it)? Every job I take I want to gain something. At 60 ill take the safe job and retire on it. Till then I want to wor with people who challenge me, not conformists.<p>So OP really consider is it so bad that you don't want that job? If you do FIGHT FOR IT. Call em tell em THEY WANTYOU! What do you have to lose? Only gain!",1239590938

There are still some ""career employees"" who work for a single company for 30 or 40 years. People who are entrepreneurial by nature usually don't stick around that long and are always trying to build something on their own. The company I work for often hires entrepreneurial type people, and we often lose them because they go off to do start ups. But from my prospective they are inspirational and do great work while they are there.",1239589298

As you can imagine, there is overlap between the scores of the smartest manual laborers and the dumbest professionals. Most occupational categories have a wide range of scores, but in general the occupations you'd expect tend to have higher mean IQ scores than the occupations not considered to require much smarts.<p>Yes, the measurement issue is very interesting in psychology. I have huge buy-in to Michell's conclusion that most of what is called measurement in psychology should not be called ""measurement"" at all. I see the consequences of the usual terminology in arguments by analogy in popular discussions of psychological tests (such as this thread), where it is commonplace for participants who have not read many psychological treatises to treat, say, IQ test scores in a way that is not warranted by how they are derived.",1239588353

For a plane as heavy as a 777 its difficult to loose altitude and speed as fast as a (for example) a MD80.\nFor those who dont know, the first aproach is a 3 degree normal glide path. The second one is almost double than that. That means maybe more than 1500 /min of discend. If you are not used flying in such conditions (almost idle engines, steep discend, speed above aproach selection) its hard to slow down your descend without smashing your tail with the ground (is what it seems it happened) or overflying the runway due to the excess air speed.<p>Well have to wait for the investigation and all the flight data to know what happened.",1373155032

It has the nice extra feature that it can be explained pretty simply, so here goes.<p>When you write a number down in (say) base 10, what you&#x27;re really doing is writing it as a sum of [small thing] x [power of 10]. So, e.g., 1234 means 1 x 10^3 + 2 x 10^2 + 3 x 10^1 + 4 x 10^0. &quot;Small thing&quot; means &quot;non-negative integer, less than the base&quot;. And of course you can do this in bases other than 10.<p>[EDIT: previous paragraph had a stupid mistake in it; thanks, grannyg00se, for catching it!]<p>But when you do this, the <i>exponents</i> may be large numbers; in particular, they may be larger than the base. So consider the following operation, given a non-negative integer and a base: write the integer as a sum of [small] x [power of base], and then do the same thing to the exponents, and to the exponents in that, etc., until you&#x27;ve got rid of all the numbers >= the base.<p>OK. Now here&#x27;s a process you can carry out. Take a number. Write it &quot;strongly in base 2&quot; according to the procedure above. Now change all the 2s to 3s, generally making the number much much bigger. Now subtract 1.<p>Now write it &quot;strongly in base 3&quot; again, change all the 3s to 4s, and subtract 1. And again: 4 -> 5, subtract 1. 5 -> 6, subtract 1.<p>If you try this on some not-too-large number, you&#x27;ll notice that the base-increasing operation typically increases the number <i>hugely</i>, whereas of course subtracting 1 decreases it <i>just a little bit</i>.<p>So here&#x27;s <i>Goodstein&#x27;s theorem</i>: start with any number you like and carry out this process; eventually the numbers will stop increasing and you&#x27;ll end up at 0.<p>(Surprise #1: what a ridiculous idea! Obviously the numbers are increasing really really fast; how can they end up at zero?)<p>It turns out that Goodstein&#x27;s theorem is actually rather easy to prove, using a bit of machinery from set theory. There&#x27;s a generalization of the natural numbers called the <i>ordinals</i>, and doing it properly requires some theorems about them, but here&#x27;s the idea. Replace all the bases with &quot;infinity&quot;. Assume some simple rules for comparing expressions full of infinities (e.g., if a<b then (anything finite) x infinity^a < infinity^b); then every time you subtract 1 and re-express your number &quot;strongly in base b&quot;, the corresponding thing full of infinities decreases. And of course when you replace all the bases with infinity, the &quot;increase the base by 1&quot; operation does nothing. And now -- and this is the bit that actually needs some set theory -- it turns out that <i>you can&#x27;t have an infinite decreasing sequence of these things-full-of-infinities</i> (they&#x27;re &quot;well-ordered&quot;). Which means that eventually you have to end up at zero.<p>(Surprise #2: this is, even when the details are filled in, a startlingly short proof for such a surprising theorem.)<p>All that stuff involving infinities is a bit weird, though. Can&#x27;t we find a nice proof that works entirely in terms of ordinary finite integers? Once you formalize what &quot;works entirely in terms of ordinary finite integers&quot; means, it turns out that the answer is no! Goodstein&#x27;s theorem is not provable from the &quot;Peano axioms&quot; describing the natural numbers; you <i>need</i> something stronger to prove it. Such as, in this case, set theory.<p>(Surprise #3: that something so innocuous requires such powerful mathematical machinery to resolve.)",1373154303

If you don&#x27;t have a remarkable idea for it, no stock picture can save you. It was literally getting in the way, so I decided to cut it out. I think the headline has more power this way, and pulls its weight, but I miss the visual impact anyway, so  I was thinking of listing portfolio projects in a slideshow in place of the illustration. Though I&#x27;d need to get some good ones under my belt first. I also sold my capabilities more and honed in on my target market, as was advised. This I thought was a better idea.<p>Also, I adjusted the contrast of the call-to-actions. Now I just have a single call to action on the page, Learn More, which now opens a modal that contains more information about me. But I tucked the second one, Contact, into a small label on the bottom right corner of the Learn Modal, that contains my phone number. I feel this may work better, but I&#x27;m going to experiment more with the contrast and see if I can find some middle ground.<p>In any case, thanks again for your time!

So I can order from numerous stores with tiny orders, which is great. But normally it looks like it will cost $4.99 for a one-store delivery, which may not be worth it for me unless I really need something urgent. Amazon Prime will almost always be worth it for me in that case, unless it&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t go two days without.

What ultimately leads to the massive &quot;wheel-barrow hyperinflations&quot; is an exponentially exploding collective loss of confidence, as in &quot;dropping by the minute&quot;. In fact, at this point the &quot;famous&quot; (as in Zimbabwe, Weimar etc.) absolutely massive printing at the late stages is no longer the cause but the result of that utter confidence loss.<p>This is probably more likely to happen earlier/faster in a national-currency-setting when exchange rates from trade with say your neighboring countries and their &quot;stabler&quot; currencies indicate a gradual loss of confidence first on their part, before that spreads to the locals?<p>But the USD has been / used to be / still to a great deal <i>is</i> &quot;the yardstick&quot; for all other currencies. &quot;The US (Treasury / Fed) does not hold reserves against its currency&quot; (apart from some Forex playmoney, those aren&#x27;t <i>reserves</i> as such) -- whereas every other Central Bank does hold such &quot;reserves against their currency&quot;, and those reserves are to a great degree USD (or USD-denominated debt &quot;assets&quot; aka treasuries etc.) as far as non-metallic reserve &quot;assets&quot; are concerned. Not exclusively USD but overwhelmingly so.<p>So that &quot;absolutely massive, all-engulfing&quot; chain-reaction-like global total loss of confidence should require a LOT more damage by USD managers than a couple quantitative easings and some fresh Fed cash for the ever-expanding USG and to bail out TBTF banks (aka ensure <i>nominal</i> performance of the financial system and hence all savings/pensions/deposits/insurances etc. regardless of &quot;eventual real&quot; performance).",1373153077

6000389,comment,5999179,6000155,1,0,bobwaycott,,,"You&#x27;re looking at history somewhat oddly. Until the outbreak of war, the Union was the entirety of the US states. It was when Southern states seceded that the Union became the Norththat is, those states upholding preservation of the Union of states and resolving the slavery issue. Once the war is underway, the Union is used interchangeably to refer to the army and the states. Among historians, pro-Union isn&#x27;t a tenable position of historiography. This isn&#x27;t about victors writing the history. The pro-Union nature of the conflict had everything to do with keeping the states united under the Constitution. The stupid semantics of calling the Civil War the War of Northern Aggression is far more a pro-South political statement than is prevailing historiography pro-North.<p>That the war was regionally divided does not lend credence to equating pro-Union with pro-North. This is key. Those who fought against state secession were motivated by wanting to preserve the Union and resolve the slavery question, not by wanting to preserve the North and destroy the South. War broke to preserve the Union in the face of Southern states wishing to break it to persist in determining their own right to perpetuate enslavement of Africans. War resulted in resolving both the status of the Union and slavery.",1373152640

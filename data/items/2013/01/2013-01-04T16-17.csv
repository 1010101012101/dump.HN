When people complain that tests take a long time to perform, the argument usually falls back to ""if your tests are useful, the time spent running them is well spent.""  Seems the same applies here.  Scala takes a long time to compile if you lean heavily on the type system.  This makes sense, since the type system can be seen as a type of test system.<p>So, if you are making useless types, the speed concern is likely best addressed by moving stuff out of the type system.

I worked at a think-tank that had 3:00 tea (with board games that occasionally went till 7:00) and it was brilliant. Let people choose whether they work in the open or in private. Work space is not to be skimped on. 150 SF per person of private and 150 SF of communal. It pays for itself, because typical open plan offices reduce productivity by 50-80%. This hybrid-plan is something Google does extremely well (although it's technically cubicle-based, anyone who wants privacy can take an office).<p>On getting fired: there are good fires and bad fires. I won't share my ""number"" but its nonzero on both sides (being fired and participating in firing) and I've seen good and bad.<p>A good fire is when they treat it as a no-fault lack-of-fit, come up with a reasonable severance (depending on their finances, this could be zero for a cash-strapped startup, or ~6 months for a rich corporation) and a positive reference. Then it's just a breakup: good people break up with each other all the time. A bad fire is when they cold-fire you and refuse to support your career recovery needs.<p>For me, it's really about references. I don't <i>need</i> a severance, but if you don't agree on a good reference I will do everything in my power to fuck up your reputation. No or bad reference => war.",1357317317

(The only thing FB is missing is Circles, that would allow me to truly separate out different groups of people).<p><i>a) its too easy to build:</i> technologies or how easy something is to build plays no part in it's popularity, the end user really doesn't care and your average user doesn't know what that .php, .aspx or .js extension really actually means.<p><i>b) it has no (large scale) viable business model:</i> It has a viable business model, possibly just not as large as the one the market has put on it, 2 different things in my opinion.<p><i>c) this is not what people want:</i> clearly it is otherwise there wouldn't be a billion people using it. I want everything in one place, it's one of the reasons I visit HN, I don't want to go to several different specialist sites to keep up to date with my friends. It's also the same reason I don't use Google+, because I have 7 friends on there and even they hardly ever post anything. If I wanted somethinf very specialist then I would join a specialist forum.

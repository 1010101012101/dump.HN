2557,comment,2367,2554,0,0,dfranke,,,"Fair enough, but my point remains that the programmers are implementing a spec designed by someone else.  When your hackers are completely in control, you can judge them simply by their ability to get things done.  If they're implementing someone else's spec, then measurement isn't that simple because their performance will be heavily influenced by the quality of the spec, no matter how much veto power you give them.  So, judging by skill at optimizing might well be the next-best alternative.<p>Then again, maybe we're all being ridiculously overanalytical and Gates just meant ""improving"" when he said ""optimizing"".",1173174701

2555,comment,2530,2530,0,0,ereldon,,,"The overall point is valid -- having a lot of users is the main way that a lot of companies make/want to make money, therefore companies should focus on scaling issues, therefore... ""use Erlang.""<p>However, conflating Web 1.0 ""get fast"" with Ruby on Rails ""develop fast"" is:<p>1) wrong: with extremely limited resources and a long list of priorities, startups need to start with fast, basic tools in order to get a functional site up -- to then discover what people want to use. scaling comes later, if ever.<p>2) self-serving: this guy seems to be intent on getting more companies using what he has to offer<p>Conclusion: mind the hyperbole.",1173173877

At MS, programmers are king. <p>A Program Manager comes up with the spec. It's up to the programmer(s) to implement it. So anything the programmer wants to ditch, goes.  <p>Read more at JOS, 'Painless Functional Specifications - Part 3: But...

I tend to read most of my non-fiction in bits and pieces when i have spare chunks of time. I tend to do most of my light reading on holiday and go cover to cover in a couple of days. I’ve followed Grisham for what seems like forever, and while its a bit hit and miss i’ve liked alot of the short stories by stephen king / richard bachman. Over the past couple of years I’ve enjoyed ‘making money’ - Pratchett, ‘The Godfather’ - Puzo, ‘grapes of wrath’ - Steinbeck, ‘vernon god little’ - Pierre & ‘shogun’ - Clavell.
Whenever I travel I’ll try and read a book set in the country I’m traveling to.<p>As a child I just couldn’t put down the Macdonald Hall series of books by Gordon Korman - they were side splittingly funny. Highly recommend Christmas present for any child you know.",1225873446

Despite a strong (though very much appreciated) message of hope, he was very clear on the magnitude of the problem and the effort it was going to take to solve it.  He seemed to touch on a lot of issues that I felt were critical to the future of the country.  Energy and environmental challenges, getting the economy back to stable ground, healing political divides and tempering extremism; these are all issues that need to be tackled, and I am happy that he addressed them here.<p>Hopefully his policies will live up to the talk, but if nothing else I believe that his message alone will go a long way towards helping improve things.  It seems all too rare these days for a politician to say that yes, things will be difficult and dirty, and there are going to need to be sacrifices from everyone, but despite all the hardships we really can work to build a better future.",1225873398
354346,comment,354165,354249,0,0,jhancock,,,"The right to create unions is a fundamental American protection.  I realize in our lifetimes we have seen some unions become more of a problem then a benefit.  This is what happens to most institutions as they become too big and ""crufty"".  Sometimes you swing too far in one direction.  The system corrects itself.  But to trash one part of the constitution while savagely protecting another part is simply unacceptable.  Its all or nothing.<p>And so far as protectionism goes.  This is just another feeling that I am certain _most_ Americans will start swinging in the other direction on.  The next year will see China<->U.S. sentiments on both sides growing very tense.<p>And high taxes?  Get this straight: When the FED/Treasury ""prints"" money, that is a tax!!!  And the last 8 years we've seen massive amounts this form of debt.",1225873285

Scan what you want and the perfectly sized clothing shows up on your doorstep in a day or two.<p>Nice side effects:<p>1) No more fear because it's easy to take back to the store if you don't like it.<p>2) For all the people that don't live in NYC or LA there would finally be a store with a decent selection...<p>3) Few clothing stores actually track purchases-- finally, you could now have a killer recommendation system that people would actually trust.<p>Solves so many problems (and probably creates a few). It kind of reminds me of Service Merchandise back in the day where they only had one item out front and everything else in the warehouse-- except now the warehouse is in ""the cloud"" so to speak.<p>...I already do this at Barnes & Noble-- browse for what I want and I've already Amazon Prime'd the book before I walk out the door...<p>Beyond the obvious technical challenges to me the biggest question is whether the economics of it works when you individually ship everything from a central location.",1225873269

A conspiracy for Benson to make money off dumb saps who believe it.<p>The court stated: ""Benson has failed to point to evidence that would create a genuinely disputed fact regarding whether the Sixteenth Amendment was properly ratified or whether United States Citizens are legally obligated to pay federal taxes. Also, as is indicated above, Benson is precluded in this action from taking the position that the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified.""[20] The court stated that ""the undisputed evidence shows that Benson had actual knowledge that the information in the Reliance Defense Package was false or fraudulent.""[21] The court also stated: ""Benson falsely tells customers that if they purchase and use his products they will be shielded from criminal prosecution for violating the internal revenue laws. Purchasers of the 'Reliance Defense Package' receive a letter signed by Benson that falsely represents that the purchaser can rely on Benson's research to conclude that the Sixteenth Amendment was not ratified, and that the purchaser is thereby not required to file federal income tax returns or pay federal income or social security taxes to the United States.""[22] The court ruled that ""Benson's position has no merit and he has used his fraudulent tax advice to deceive other citizens and profit from it"" in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 6700.[23]<p>And honestly, you don't think that a bunch of rich people would have tried to overturn the income tax back when it was 70%? I'm in the upper tax bracket. If I didn't have to pay it or I could donate to a fund for people who wanted to overturn it, I would in a heart beat.<p>I think it is a silly arguement to have. If it were up to me, all the taxes would be income taxes and everything else would be 0. No capital gains, no estate, no tariffs, no corporate. Make the American people feel exactly what these programs cost - becuase right now they pay all the other taxes indirectly and they don't know it. Make people feel what a big government really means on their pocket and then you will see how many more people are screaming for libertarian policies. But saying ""we shouldn't pay any tax"" and ""i wish I could succeed from the government"" which I know is a common libertarian ideal, is just so impractical as to be a detriment to the cause.",1225872853
354340,comment,354165,354330,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"The unions will not fade. Their biggest membership comes from federal government workers, whose numbers burgeoned under Bush and are bound to grow under Obama. Also, union firms like GM are getting $billions from the Federal Government to make up for the fact that they can't turn a profit on the market (the airlines did this, too). Tax money will keep them alive even if they are the dinosaurs of the marketplace.<p>When anti-China tariffs come down the line, you can thank the unions. Obama will not deny them. You can also nix the idea of school choice under an Obama administration, since the National Teacher's Union is a strong supporter of the Democratic Party. It's no wonder that Obama's plan for education is basically ""more money! more money!"". The unions couldn't have written a more favorable plan themselves.",1225872560

I have no objections to these rules in terms of Twitter growing as a company. I think there are a lot of applications that can be built aside from clients and it makes sense for them to steer people in that direction.<p>As a user, however, I feel attached to the idea that data and application are separate. I would like to think that I own my Tweets, but most of all I just want to _feel_ like I own my tweets  like I can _do_ whatever I want with them and see them however I want.

Accuracy of map data<p>2. Coverage of map data<p>3. Accuracy of map searches (streets, postcodes, POIs)<p>4. Routing (this is hard problem though)<p>5. Satellite imagery (for some this would be above routing)<p>6. Streetview (for some this would be higher)<p>7. 3D stuff<p>OSM would help with the first three points (along with other sources of course, just as say tomtom needs supplemented), and <i>would also help in future</i> as other people would do the hard mapping and updating work for apple, which will otherwise prove to be a mammoth task.<p>Everything else is far less important than getting the basic mapping data right first, including 3D renders of major cities, and even satellite data (nice to have, but less important than basic search and display of accurate mapping).<p>If they used OSM data and imported (say) every month, they could just tell people to visit OSM to make corrections, and problem areas would gradually get better. As it is they're going to have to sift through hundreds of thousands of reports of missing roads etc which just say 'this is broken, fix it', and they're likely to just be submerged under that workload. Anyway, I don't think we're saying such different things - I'm not saying OSM would cure all Apple's problems or even most of them, just that I thought it would be the best choice for them for the most important facet of their map product, the basic vector data, which is sorely lacking at present and unlikely to rapidly improve.",1348175501

4550674,comment,4548829,4550412,12,0,ChuckMcM,,,"You have completely missed the big picture here.<p>Google charges 'volume' users of their maps API, that is part of the way they pay for it. The map ""application"" on iOS was a client that called Google Maps APIs and displayed the results. It generates a lot of volume, and Apple was going to have to start paying for that this year.<p>you wrote: ""For example if you show a map on your homepage with all the locations of your stores.""<p>If you did that enough times Google would start charging you. They also reserve the right to show ads for <i>somebody else's store</i> on your map. (not that they would just yet, but they keep that right in reserve if you want to use their content.)<p>Google and Apple sell Ads. Google is much better at it than Apple is, but the great untapped market is effectively advertising to mobile users. A common theme for desktop users is they use web search a lot, a common theme for mobile users is that they use map search a lot.<p>Apple wants you to sell ads through their network, so they get a huge chunk of the ad revenue that you are getting for your content. They do this because you're showing your ad on an Apple device. When you use Google maps through a browser you get ads <i>from Google's ad network</i> on the page. If you use an Application (usually a better UX) the platform provider has more control over you (they have to approve your App after all) So the fight here is who sells the advertisement into the Maps data stream.<p>Google has the best mapping product on the planet at the moment. They can use that to demand concessions like ""we get all the ad revenue"" in exchange for you being able to use our data/api. They don't care if the local restaurant shows a map to their location, the <i>do</i> care if you're an application that millions of people might use.<p>Its pretty clear that Google and Apple agreed to disagree and end their relationship with respect to Maps. That the Apple product is so horrible suggests that this relationship ended earlier than Apple planned, or their Maps technology has matured more slowly than they anticipated. Either way, the result is that Apple now has a grossly inferior maps application on their most successful products. This is going to cost them both in sales to people who are on the fence with regard to mobile, and in customer goodwill (this is already evident). That is a calculated risk they took. The alternative was to meet Google's requirements, whatever they were, to continue to use their map data in their application.<p>The part I think you are missing is this. Apple had to know how crappy their Map application was, customer experience is what they do, they don't just forget about it all of a sudden.  Given that they are shipping that pile of crap means that they and Google are at odds on this issue. Is there any scenario where Apple would 'approve' an application by Google that would be instantly significantly better than their native App? Or conversely, given that they couldn't reach an agreement on the native App, do you think Google would agree to constraints in a published App that they would not agree to in a native App?<p>No, the only explanation that is credible is that they walked away and Apple has dug in their heels and bet that they can build out a better map experience faster than Google can take market share away with Android's map experience. From where I am sitting, given the significance of the risk involved in taking that path (some of which we're seeing being actualized as rampant ridicule) I can only imagine how distasteful Google must have made it for Apple to stick with them. And <i>that</i> suggests to me that you will never see another native Google maps product on iOS until Apple capitulates and cedes the space to Google or Apple moves so far ahead of Google that they no longer feel it is a threat to their advertising base.",1348175003

It seems strange to me that logicless templates who have taken it too far have gained so much popularity in js templating.<p>For someone considering handlebars, here is what I have found  really constraining, note that most of them are by design:<p>- No builtin equality check between two variables. So, you can do:<p><pre><code>   `{{#if my_boolean}}`, but cannot do 

   `{{#if my_variable == 2 }}`

   You have two options here: 

   - Resort to implementing an ifequal helper (and other trivial helpers like gt, lt etc.)
   - Prepare everything before handing it to the template, so before passing the json to the template, add another field like, equal_to_two to check for equality with 2.
</code></pre>
- Partials lack access to parent.<p>Say you are iterating over answers of a question, so you do:<p>{{#each answers }}<p>{{ text }} - {{ user }}<p>{{/each}}<p>At some point, you will want to add some information in the parent scope, so you do this:<p>{{#each answers }}<p>{{ answer.text }} - {{ answer.user }} -- in response to {{../user }}<p>{{/each}}<p>Now, you may want to register this snippet as a partial:<p>{{ answer.text }} - {{ answer.user }} -- in response to {{../user }}<p>So that you can do:<p>{{#each answers }}
{{> answer_partial }}
{{/each}}<p>But answer_partial cannot access the parent scope (question item); so you resort to another custom helper ""include"".<p>- Lack of keyword and delimiter compatibility with Django/Jinja2; so you need to replace each of your {% if %}'s to {{if}} and so on.<p>- It is hard to tell what the current context is referring to at times, so, it is helpful to use an additional debug helper (again not builtin) that just logs the current context. Block helpers change the context, except when they don't.<p>The only reservation I have with nunjucks is that it faces the danger that it might be abandoned like other efforts; other than that, it seems it will address all the painpoints I am experiencing with handlebars, but speaking with jlongster on twitter, he seems determined to keep working on it.",1348174833

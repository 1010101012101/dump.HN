Software is much more complicated.""</i><p>For those of you who, like me, have wondered how processors and other complex hardware  are so reliable, while software is disgraceful, he's probably got the answer.<p><i>""Sometimes I think that the goals people are trying to reach are just too much to ask for. Programmers often lose sight of the fact that the problems in building software systems arise because what they are trying to do is just too hard. They believe the computer is a universal engine that can do anything. It’s very easy to be seduced into the proposition that a group of one or five or ten or fifty or a thousand programmers can make the computer do anything. That’s clearly not right.""</i><p>Interesting...",1204418923

For instance the commentator points out that there should be a larger difference between the average IQ's of Hong Kong and mainland China, given China's massive peasant population. However, the wikipedia page points out that the Chinese rural population was never tested, and that the differences in scores was artificially added by the authors:<p>""For People's Republic of China, the authors used a figure of 109.4 for Shanghai and adjusted it down by an arbitrary 6 points because they believed the average across China's rural areas was probably less than that in Shanghai. Another figure from a study done in Beijing was not adjusted downwards. Those two studies formed the resultant score for China (PRC).",1204417686

126992,comment,126593,126593,0,0,oz,,,"Inspirational article, and it hits home on many levels. I remember loving math at 12, kicking major ass in geometry. But as I grew older, I didn't seem to pick it up. I wasted time in high school, and failed Pre-Calculus at Uni, but I now realize 2 things:<p>1 - Math is rarely taught well. The ""ax2+bx+c=0"" approach to teaching quadratic equations is rubbish. I never understood what it was they were trying to solve until a few months ago I was at the library and read a book on the history of mathematics. It became crystal clear. IIRC, the Indians used quadratics to make sure that they could increase the size of their altars without losing the proportions.<p>2 - Many people who get good grades in Math don't get it at a fundamental level. Sure, they can regurgitate the rules of logarithms, and solve worksheet questions that follow a <i>specific</i> pattern, but outside of that, they're sitting ducks. I've asked several people why ax2+bx+c=0. Why doesn't it equal 37? Or 3.456? None of them have a clue. I realize that this logic can be applied to me if someone asked me about branch prediction or out-of-order execution, but I think the logic holds.<p>I've also realized that I use ratio to solve many problems. I remember in my year at Uni, we were given a problem to solve in electronics class. I realized the answer immediately, knowing that 1 amp is = to 1 volt applied across a resistance of one ohm by definition. The 'math genius' in the class struggled.<p>I've always believed that those who have a natural talent for programming also have a natural talent for math. It's just not <i>taught</i> well. Me, I've convinced myself that I have the latent ability, it'll just require me to learn it on my own terms, instead of a formula-based approach. In the same history of math book, they showed the history of place value, and it made so much sense. The same approach we take to crafting algorithms can be used to find the solution to math problems. Again, great article. Gotta love YC.<p>PS. I just noticed that when you enclose text in *s, it gets displayed in italics. Nice one, PG<p>PPS. Actually, I can speculate about branch prediction and OOE. But that's for another time.",1204417312

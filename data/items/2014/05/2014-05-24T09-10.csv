This is often done out of jealousy, spite, or plain old ignorance.<p>The bottom line though is that if your primary stakeholders are listening attentively to the developers concerns about the underlying integrity of the product then you&#x27;ve got much larger problems than just a messy codebase and it might be time to abandon ship.",1400925343

You should only kill -9 when every other signal the program is likely to respond to has not worked. kill -9 is likely to leave program in a state that requires manual intervention, especially if that program is a database.<p>If you&#x27;re a developer, before you kill -9 a program send SIGTERM (ie kill without args or kill -15). If the program does not respond, run gdb -p <pid> and then &quot;thread apply all bt&quot; before killing it. At the very least, you should get a good idea of why it was not responding to other signals.",1400925281

That&#x27;s when you should not &#x27;kill -9&#x27;.<p>I have heard the best practice advice for many years and I think that the &#x27;you should send some friendly signal first&#x27; is not universally what works out best. For instance, if your Chrome browser is getting out of hand and the system is permanently doing some 96% wait for some reason, a gentle killing of Chrome will take ages and, when it restarts, you might get some but not all of your tabs back. With a killall -s 9 you can be back to work quickly with all your tabs (and underlying swappiness problem hopefully resolved).",1400925004

7793011,comment,7790065,7792976,3,0,h1karu,,,"Here&#x27;s an example from the viewpoint of someone doing the hiring.  Lets assume your goal is to hire the top 5% of technology X programmers in America.<p>The first 5 people you hire are all early to mid 30s white guys who go out drinking together, get together to play paintball every few weeks, etc.  Then the 6th person you need to hire is a Bangladeshi woman aged 42 who doesn&#x27;t drink at all and of course doesn&#x27;t play paintball.   Well it&#x27;s not a big deal at all, the team welcomes her, is very professional around her, recognizes the difference in culture and age so they don&#x27;t give her a hard time for not participating in the drinking and paintball culture.  So far no problems..<p>The 7th hire is another white guy, aged 31,  but the difference is that this 7th hire also doesn&#x27;t want to drink socially or play paintball.  Unlike the Bangladeshi woman he has no convenient excuse to not want to do those things, so therefor even if he&#x27;s very friendly, professional, and competent on the job he is ultimately labeled as &quot;distant&quot; by the other coworkers his age, and over time the rest of the team will grow to resent him for not &quot;trying harder&quot; to become friends outside of the office.  People will assume that he thinks he&#x27;s &quot;too good for us&quot;, but those same people will not make such assumptions about the attitude of the Bangladeshi woman.<p>The Bangladeshi woman&#x27;s choice to not try to become close personal friends with her coworkers is well respected and is not a problem at all, she is given all the space she could ever want socially and is only judged based on her contributions to the company. The young white guy on the other hand is held to a different set of standards, for him to not actively try to become personal friends (outside of work hours) is something that could cause him to be perceived as not a good cultural fit and possibly cost him his job in the long run all due to a hidden expectation linked to his skin color and age.<p>This is the kind of drama that can crop up in a real office which just completely disappears once a company &quot;goes remote&quot;.",1400924681

7792990,comment,7790065,7792473,1,0,Dewie,,,"> It&#x27;s unfortunate that what I have presented comes off sounding as an &quot;approach&quot;,<p>If I had spiritual beliefs and practices, I would still call that an <i>approach</i>. I could have a really personal and deep relationship with god, or whatever it is, and that is still and approach that works for me. Maybe that diminishes it? Well, I meant more to say that there are many roads to Rome. Some people find the answer in a Christian god, other people find the answer in a god that is more akin to a universal mind. Other people don&#x27;t think the notion of a god/gods useful or truthful. Some people, and religions, will call this viewpoint heresy.<p>Do I look at spirituality as a sort of means-to-an-end? Yes. If you find a way that makes you a good person and makes you lead a full/happy/whatever criteria life, then that in itself is a big reward. Is it self-serving? Yes, but I don&#x27;t view that as a bad thing.<p>An important factor, I guess, is that my beliefs around spirituality don&#x27;t involve some struggle against evil, or saving others, or some eternal and final scoreboard, which many religions have. I don&#x27;t think this life makes or breaks anything. In that sense, I am more curious about how to live a good life, because that&#x27;s all I have right now, or might ever have.",1400923273

I just didn&#x27;t have the spirit to do it. (I know many people here know what I am talking about.) Over time I got depressed about this: Do I have a terrible work ethic? Am I really just a bad programmer? A bad person?</i><p>I never thought about it that way, but this resonates with me. I recently ended a job at a pretty big company and I often felt like you describe. At the time, I kinda shrugged it off as normal; after all, weren&#x27;t office jobs <i>supposed</i> to be soul-crushing? Plus, maybe I wasn&#x27;t that good anyway. Maybe my team leads were right. Maybe this was just my role in the corporate ladder. I joked with my friends about how I was just mooching off the company, how a dog could do my work, but it felt kinda shitty and it was hard to care in that environment.<p>The difference between that and the passion project I&#x27;m working on now is striking. It doesn&#x27;t feel like work. I can stay up coding until 4, 5, 6 in the morning if I really want to see the fruits of my labor. (And I often do.) I actually look forward to pulling out my laptop. I have enough good ideas to keep me busy for the next few years. And most importantly, I&#x27;m finally getting to the point where I can prove myself creatively.<p>(On the other hand, it was one year of great money for not <i>too</i> much spiritual trauma, and now I can travel the world and work on the good stuff for a couple of years without worry.

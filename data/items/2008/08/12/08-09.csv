I use it to check my mails, browsing (OperaMini rox), connect to my servers using Putty, car navigation using Pocket Google Maps, WarDriving, storage device and a lot of other stuff including using it as speedometer :)<p>I am thinking about upgarding to HTC TyTn II or HTC Touch Pro. Both are great phones. Infact Windows Mobile is a cool platform with so many useful applications. Windows Mobile doesn't is great out of the box but with little tweaking no other phones can beat it.<p>I recommend that you go for any Windows Mobile 6.1 based device. However HTC TyTn II and Touch Pro are highly recommended :)",1218530536

Certainly in the UK they (Major banks & Paypal) will not issue me with a merchant account, and the reason they cite is that it's too big a fraud risk. I can see how it would be an easy way to launder money.<p>If you manage to overcome this problem, I'd love to hear about it :-)",1218529605

How can you even begin to cope with society if you don't learn from your mistakes?<p>Learning from your mistakes seems, to me, like having pain receptors. People without pain receptors exist, and they hurt themselves all the time in terrible ways, so that they need specialised, permanent care just to exist and not kill themselves all the time. The pain allows you to learn from your physical mistakes and not do them again.<p>If you can't learn from your other mistakes, how can you do anything but hurt yourself all the time? If 30% of children were truly like that, they would be extremely dysfunctional. I'm not saying that this is not the case - after all, if you think about it, there are a fair number of children at school who seem dysfunctional in some ways (though usually not the ones you'd think at first glance), like repeat-offender bullies - but if that is the case, shouldn't the solution be to discover a fix to this dysfunction rather than just telling parents ""Oh well, your child doesn't learn from its mistakes, your parenting won't matter very much"".",1218528412

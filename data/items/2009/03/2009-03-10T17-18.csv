The bottleneck in coding is always the thinking time, or you're using an overly verbose language.<p>Typing is important because hackers communicate with one another using a keyboard.  I've worked with programmers who couldn't type quickly enough to have a comfortable conversation over IM.  It's torture.<p>If you can't type, it's probably because you're not communicating enough.  Hacking is not a solitary activity, and it's mostly not coding.",1236707809

510293,comment,510087,510127,0,0,jrockway,,,"Typing speed is important for the reason the article mentions -- micro-interruptions.  Most of the time, you just have to type a few words, and the editor will complete the rest for you.  Fine.  But a lot of the time, you are typing a symbol for the first time, and autocompletion doesn't really help.  It breaks your flow if you can't type this symbol quickly and correctly the first time. (It is also worth pointing out that I can type most words faster than it would take to cycle through potential expansion candidates, so I only use it for moderately-long identifiers.  Abbreviation expansion becomes less of a time saver when you learn to type more quickly.)<p>Anyway, a few months ago, I decided I would learn to properly touch-type (and increase my typing speed).  It was very difficult at first -- I couldn't type at all, and even simple programming made me really mad.  A few months later, I can type significantly faster, and I make many fewer errors.  (As an aside, I don't think touch-typing was really designed for programmers.  All the important symbols end up under your pinkys, which is not very comfortable.  So I compromise and type some symbols like ()- with my ring-finger.  This probably reduces speed, but it doesn't hurt my hand.)<p>The common response to typing is ""programming is not about typing, it's about thinking"".  Sure, that's mostly true.  Nobody expects you to sustain 120 wpm typing for eight hours a day.  But, it's very helpful to type quickly in bursts, to get your ideas in to code form as quickly as possible.  Sketching out that idea in 2 minutes instead of 3 means that your brain has more time to think about the problem, and has to waste less of its time babysitting your fingers.  I know I get mad when my typing speed is delaying me from trying an idea as quickly as possible.  That's why I decided to do something about it.<p>I'm glad I spent the time to practice typing.  It has made programming and writing more enjoyable, and didn't take much time or effort at all.  The dismissive attitude of ""programming doesn't require typing skills"" is extremely naive.",1236707752

510291,comment,509978,509978,0,0,curtis,,,"I think focusing on method length is focusing on the wrong thing.  Some of the worst long methods I've seen weren't bad because they were long, they were bad because they had about eight or nine levels of nesting.  When a method ends with<p><pre><code>                                }

It was found that if you put fish in rice and let it sit for months, the fermented rice kills off the bacteria, and keeps the fish edible, even if the fermented rice smelled like vomit.<p>When the practice migrated to Japan, the lords of Kyoto began to eat the fish earlier and earlier, and found that the rice, slightly fermented, was actually quite good.

I'm sure I'm not the only one.  When Java started taking off with J2EE, I tried really hard to let the majors (Sun, IBM, Netscape, Microsoft, BEA) understand how their monolithic frameworks were not what most users needed.
It all fell on deaf ears to the tune of: ""What, EJBs are too complex? Swing shouldn't bypass native UI controls?""  This not just from the architects inside those big co's, but from the users that would believe anything a big co told them.

It's not mere callousness, it's poor analysis.<p>Whether you want to think about it or not, child sexual abuse is no dead crime. It's alarmingly common. It effects at least 20% of those closest to me - and this only for cases that I know of. From national surveys of adults, (www.unh.edu/ccrc/factsheet/pdf/CSA-FS20.pdf) it's estimated that 9-32% of women and 5-10% of men were subject to sexual abuse during their childhoods (though statistics for criminal reported cases are much lower -- about  1.2
per 1,000 children).<p>Who is to say that were the law enforcement less vigilant, such abuse wouldn't escalate. In many countries, it does. Particularly in South-East Asia and Eastern Europe, the sex trade is rampant -- Unicef estimates put it at 1 million young sold into the trade per year (<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/1707763.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/1707763.stm</a>). The amber alert is but one deterrent; the combined effect is likely quite effective.<p>Who among those arguing for AMBER alerts are campaigning against charity programs to Africa? What instead we have are law enforcement agencies partnering up to work against child abductions and sexual abuse effectively.<p>Effectively? It is even, by many standards, economical. The economic loss of 27 children would almost certainly exceed the $30 million in funds nationally allocated to it. The biggest tax you pay is in attention, and even there you've already given to it in reaction more attention than it demands. Is there a school program, obesity program, or swimming pool program that would do the same?<p>There may be more immediately successful uses for said attention and funding abroad. But do those fighting child abductions and absurd donate less money and time to charitable concerns abroad. It is only my impression, but in my corner of the world apparently not. Those concerned with and directly involved in advancing social good are rarely concerned with just one part of it.<p>Do not, then, begrudge people of the interest in the safety of their children and community, of their charitable work, and of their fears. To do so is not only to deny to human nature some of the most powerful forces for good, but to deny the self-interest that drives our society, without which we would wither.",1236705534

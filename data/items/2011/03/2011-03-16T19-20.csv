You generally perform a sequence of experiments, construct a low entropy theory, and then apply that theory in the future. Kind of like what Louis Slotkin did.<p>He doesn't need to redo them on a train, a plane, in a car, at the bar. The fundamental principles discovered tend to be pretty solid.<p><i>Prove it.</i><p>Not that hard. Take a fixed volume, convolve it with the 1/r kernel of the neutron diffusion equation. If the volume of uranium is a sphere, you get the spot neutron density at the center is [(3V)^{2/3}]/2. If the volume is a disk of height dz, radius R, you find the the local density is 2(pi V dz)^{1/2}. The smaller dz gets, the smaller the local density of neutrons is, and the further from criticality you are.<p>(Computing the volume at someplace other than the center is left as an exercise for the reader. However, the maximum principle shows that it always goes down.)<p>Now plug this into the standard soliton machinery (i.e., use Duhamel's principle, L^p-L^q estimates, etc) and you'll always need a bigger source for a flat soliton than a spherical one.<p>Yes, I'm skipping a few steps. You can find them in Cazenave's book on solitons (that's where I learned it) and most likely any book on nuclear engineering (but with much less of a mathematical bent). No, it's not the ""undergrad physics textbook"" you seem to think I'm referring to.<p><i>It's pretty amazing how everyone wants to cite ""physics"" to prove that there's no problem with a meltdown (in the face of overwhelming empirical evidence to the contrary), but nobody is doing much more than hand-waving allusions toward their undergrad physics textbook in defense of their assertions.</i><p>What is the ""overwhelming empirical evidence"" that criticality will be achieved?",1300304998

It presents itself as an engineering safety analysis. The first step in judging an engineering safety analysis is usually: was it performed by someone qualified to perform such an analysis? We typically want them to be performed by people who are both domain experts (in this case, nuclear engineers), and specifically people who are experts in assessing the risks in that domain, as well as in the general science of risk analysis. If a safety analysis is done by someone who <i>isn't</i> such an expert, it's quite rational to give it lower weight, because we aren't confident that they're familiar with all the relevant science and possible risks.<p>I mean, would you argue it's also a genetic fallacy that I take articles in <i>Nature</i> more seriously than I take articles in the <i>Daily Mail</i>? That I believe what Richard Feyman's lectures have to say about physics more than I believe what some random person on Geocities has to say? It just seems like good sense to me; considering the source of a claim is a good first step when deciding how much weight to give it. Bayesians would agree! It's possible that the <i>Daily Mail</i> will publish an insightful new analysis of global warming, but it's not very likely, and I would probably want to hear confirmation from a more reliable source before I believed it.

Keep it up and you'll soon get even more traction.<p>In November 2010 I discovered Kinect hacking and created a blog with the latest hacks, <a href=""http://KinectHacks.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://KinectHacks.net</a>, just for fun. Since it was the only blog about the topic at the time it grew quickly and the in the first month it reached 100 000 unique visitors and 300 000 pageviews. In the end of January it had gotten over a million pageviews.<p>I eventually got tired of running it, it took time away from my real business, so I sold it on Flippa.com for $12600 (<a href=""http://bit.ly/hBcQQb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/hBcQQb</a> , requires login).<p>One of the best tips I can give you is to invest in a realtime analytics service like Clicky, which I used. It's really helpful for immediately noticing when stuff go viral and take action on it.<p>Another cool thing is that the new owner spent just $200 on Facebook advertisements and got over 10000 likes for the group (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/KinectHacking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/KinectHacking</a>) in a week because of it. I've always heard that Facebook ads don't work, but it surely worked in this case. Just goes to show that you should never take stuff as granted before you've tested it yourself.",1300304584

You should let them know what your observation is about the amount of time that you expect the work to take, and give them the opportunity to explain to you why it's taking longer.<p>Agile/Scrum are good for this, because they give people the responsibility to commit to which work they'll be completing on a given day, and explain why they're blocked or moving more slowly.<p>Perhaps you should have a daily 15-minute scrum meeting to get a sense of exactly where they are and how things are going? More communication always makes things more transparent.<p>If you can't do that, set a deadline. Work will always expand to fit the allotted time, so make sure you're keeping the timeframe short enough to make sure the team knows that the project completion date is not open-ended.",1300302212

If someone's putting most of his service from the pieces hosted elsewhere, what it will be? I can say that it'll be probably sloooow ;)<p>Anyway I share your sentiment towards ORMs, with a little difference that I prefer data mapper (as a pattern) over active record (as a pattern). Active record locks you in the ghetto where the only primary source of the schema information are your artificially crafted ORM-dependent tables, where in data mapper the database itself can give this information to you via reflection of the ""real"" tables. This is priceless when dealing not only with legacy databases but also with effects of ad-hoc operational fixes, which in turn can save your production sometimes. Data mapper has got also object identities right.",1300302122

2333392,comment,2333027,2333027,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been shocked at how often I see the Dropbox icon on friend's systems. I no longer live in silicon valley, and so I am completely out of the echo chamber (except what I read here at HN). These are not nerds, not techies, and not people who follow TechCrunch. These are artists, musicians, old folks, nomads, and all sorts of folks that just don't do technology. But, they get Dropbox. Admittedly, my parents aren't using Dropbox, but my parents don't read CNN.com, either, and I can't imagine what they would even use Dropbox for. I can't even get them to use flickr for photos, despite buying them a digital camera (my mom still uses a film camera when she travels because she's afraid she'll lose or break the digital one).<p>If I could invest in Dropbox, I would. But, that wasn't always true. I met Drew at a YC party before they had anything to show, and were still figuring out the diffing/versioning problems, and all the underlying hard problems. And, I came away thinking, ""Well, that's been done before. A lot. And it never went anywhere."" I had even built a little web-based file manager and sharing app as a RoR practice app, a couple weeks before. So, I thought I knew a business that wouldn't go anywhere when I saw it. I thought highly of Drew, but not much of the idea. I was obviously very wrong about the idea.<p>Anyway, my point is, Dropbox hasn't been something ""you've never heard of"" for quite some time.",1300302070

Anyone who looks for security vulnerabilities on websites they don't own or control is on shaky legal footing (there are exceptions: Google, Mozilla, Facebook, and a few other companies provide systems for the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities). However, publicly disclosing vulnerabilities on a competitor's website (and making your proof of concept mildly malicious) is never going to work out well for anyone: it makes your company look like a bully and exposes you to potential legal ramifications.",1300302014

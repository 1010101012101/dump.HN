488546,comment,488385,488385,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"One of the best days I've had since starting my current company has been receiving an email from a C-level at our largest competitor, pointing out a flaw in the product comparison table on our website (due to the fact that they had released a new version that added one of the features we had that they didn't).  I imagine the guys at Mint must have been downright giddy receiving this letter.<p>On another note...Whenever I get into a conversation about a business I wish I'd started, Mint is the first one that comes to mind.  It's such a <i>huge</i> market, and Intuit has failed so miserably to make the transition to the web--and if they ever admit that the web is a better way to solve this problem, they'll have to accept dramatically lower per-user revenue, which is something that very few companies have the balls to do.  It's why the tech industry has massive churn every 10-20 years--market leaders get eaten from the bottom (mainframes by minis, minis by micros, etc. for example).",1235123426

488534,comment,488357,488438,0,0,patio11,,,"Does your language of choice have a Google Chart integration?  Rails has a couple options, and I have never found anything that gets ""quick and dirty chart"" done as fast or easily.  I currently use it for most of my dashboard charts.  While it has some annoying limitations it frees you from server-side dependencies on image modification libraries and the resulting charts (static images) can be accessed from a cell phone.  (Some of the Javascript and Flash solutions I've used don't handle that so well.)<p>This lets you ignore the whole annoying step of logging into Google Docs to review the data -- just spit the URL for the chart directly into an image tag on your panel, problem solved.  It also greatly simplifies any sort of ""manipulate Google Docs' interface"" step you might have, since you can just write arbitrary parsing code in your language of choice and then spit the numbers into the chart.<p>For additional sexy you can add any lightbox script you want and then have, essentially, a Javascript zoom button for any of them in about 4 marginal lines of code.",1235121877

There are so many technologies that you could apply to web development that by limiting yourself initially you'll stand a better chance of succeeding and not being overwhelmed.<p><i>You need to learn things in this order.<p>HTML</i><p>HTML is the language that web pages are built in, it is the foundation of the web. Since its introduction it has gone through several improvements / changes so make sure you get a tutorial that shows you things the way they are done now, not 12 years ago.<p><i>CSS so you can style your pages</i><p>CSS stands for 'cascading style sheets', and is used to give pages their 'looks'. Best practice these days is to uncouple 'looks' and 'layout' from 'content'. This is a difficult concept to get your head wrapped around because initially it seems like things are being made harder on purpose, but as you get more proficient you'll find it easier until you start wondering why people did it any different.<p><i>JavaScript so you can do dynamic things</i><p>JavaScript is a programming language that has become the standard for extending web page functionality on the client side. JavaScript is probably the easiest way to get your feet wet with programming, because you do not need anything but a browser in order to learn and practice with it. I'd personally advise you to use a browser that has a JavaScript console such as firefox so that you can see the cause of any issues in case your programming is less than perfect (which it is bound to be initially).<p><i>JQuery makes JavaScript much easier</i><p>JQuery is a library of javascript code that allows you to perform much needed functionality without having to code it all up by hand. It also gives you a good sized chunk of code to look at so that you can learn from other peoples code.<p><i>With this you can actually publish a fully functional web site with a hosting company.</i><p>But up to this point it will still be a 'static' website in the sense that no programs are running on the server side.<p>If you want to do more complicated things, especially things that produce pages that are different based on the 'state' saved on the server then you will need to get into server side programming. Server side coding is used for almost every serious website nowadays, almost every website that you are a regular user of will have lots of server side programming done, even if the output of that program looks like any other webpage.<p><i>The server side is needed if you have a high volume site or one with dynamic content, such as a shopping site or with visitor created content.</i><p>In order to create dynamic web pages you will need to have a server, and you will need to install an environment on it that allows you to run the code that will produce the web pages on the fly.<p>There are a great number of choices that you could make at this point, you'll need to consider which language you want to use (the most frequently used language for web page creation, not neccesarily in order of my preference are: php, perl, python, asp, rails, java, the site you are readin this on is written in 'lisp').<p>Underneath that language there has to be a 'webserver', which can be a general purpose web server such as 'apache', but it can also be a language specific 'application server', such as TomCat (for java) any one of a whole slew of these, for a list see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_application_servers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_application_serve...</a> ).<p><i>For that you need an application server: Django, PHP, Rails, Tomcat, Jboss, etc.</i><p>Because a server side application will almost always store state (stuff that remains on the server even if the user isn't there) you will need to get some knowledge of databases at this point. Contenders are PostgreSQL and MySQL.<p><i>About that time you will need to think about databases and SQL.</i><p>My advice is to learn how to create good pages before learning the server side.<p>And I fully concur with that.",1235121282

7577,comment,6918,7050,0,0,ClintonKarr,,,"Aur, thank you for your insight. Currently I would say I fall more into a marketing/sales/negotiation ""box,"" which I believe is an important aspect for start-ups.<p>If I were to begin a start-up it would be as a co-founder. Yes, I would need to find someone with the technical know how - fortunately I'm living with a software engineer. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure he is happy with his job...but maybe I can convince him to give me 20% of his time if I develop my plan further.<p>Again, I appreciate your response.<p>Best wishes,<p>Clinton",1175270161

7575,comment,7543,7543,0,0,pg,,,"It's true that making something people want, if you push it too far, would cause you to make something dangerously addictive.  But <i>very</i> few startups are that successful; 99.9% of them err on the side of not making something attractive enough.<p>So ""Make something people want"" is like ""Get more exercise."" <p>Plus, if you want to try to replace this rule with one that works in that additional .1% of cases as well, it's hard to say what it should be.  ""Make something people should want?"" Then you're on the road to fascism (if you have a lot of power) or failure (if you're just a little startup).  I suspect that ""Make something people want"" is optimal in the same way democracy is.  As Churchill said, it's the worst form of government except all the others.",1175269522

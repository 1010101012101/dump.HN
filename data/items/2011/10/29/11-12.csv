3171689,comment,3169475,3171593,8,0,nonrecursive,,,"Your comment would be more helpful if it didn't misrepresent the blog post. Hank is nowhere saying that ""any news media or investor who is not paying attention is racist"". He's also not saying that he and others in NewMe deserve anything just because they're black and under-represented. Finally, it's pretty ridiculous to imply that this guy, Hank Williams - and ALL black people out there - are trying to turn venture capitalism into philanthropy. The other response says your comment wasn't offensive enough to merit a temp account. I think you did the right thing; personally, I would be embarrassed and ashamed to make such degrading remarks.<p>That aside - I believe the premise of Hank's post is that it's not a meritocracy in Silicon Valley. It's hard to know for sure whether this is true because there's no way to test this hypothesis. But I think it's safe to assume that VC's are still human, and like every other human, they all have biases, including racial biases. There's nothing wrong with that, in my opinion. However, if they're not aware of that bias - perhaps, mentally, they reject that they have any racial bias because they think that will make them a bad person - then they won't take any conscious steps to correct it. The result would be that fewer black entrepreneurs get funded.<p>You should realize that being black in America is not like being fat. For most of our country's history, black people have been treated as less than human. It wasn't even until fairly recently in our country's history that blacks gained the legal right, throughout the country, to use the same restrooms and water fountains. Can you imagine that? If you think that that kind of institutionalized racism has completely evaporated, you are wrong.<p>I think it would benefit you to read the book ""Black Like Me"" by John Howard Griffin. It will probably change your apparent opinion that black people are a bunch of whiners demanding charity.",1319889340

3171686,comment,3171448,3171597,13,0,kia,,,"I am using LFS as a primary OS for Linux development and on servers. I can tell my story how I ended up with LFS in the forest of Linux distributions.<p>Some time ago when I started to learn Linux I have tried a lot of different distributions. All of them had their quirks. Some were buggy. Some were slow. Some had extremely weird and bloated configuration systems. Imagine several layers of abstraction above plain standard configuration files when you have to learn everything basically from the beginning with a different distribution. For example on top of standard config files they may have some configuration system (like YaST in SUSE) on top of which the GUI sits (so 3 layers just to change the screen resolution). Many distros have their own ""unique"" way of configuring the system. And when something will brake you will have no idea where the problem might be. Is it a bug in the package or in some layer of configuration system or somewhere else? I understand that they try to make the system more user friendly. Well, every one has its own niche.<p>With LFS you just learn the configuration of basic packages once. The way that package creator intended. Plain text files and nothing more. As an additional bonus you have great performance and security because you only have the packages you need. Plus everything is optimized for your architecture. If you have ever used some distribution in a virtual machine on a slow notebook you know what I am talking about.<p>When I built LFS for the first time I did everything by hand. It was a very useful experience and a nice way to learn. Of course now I don't do it manually. You can use automated tools (jhalfs for example) which extract instructions from the book and do everything for you. I don't use any graphical environment so no need to build a lot of stuff beyond the base system.<p>Of course LSF has its own issues. Lack of package management is one of them. But if you like minimalistic and fast systems you should give LFS a try.",1319889159

The situation is not much different than, say, commercial software: You don't expect paid programmers to release their code in the open as long as they can take advantage of it for making money, but when that stops, they do. Similarly, researchers will use it for funding, promotions, prestige etc. However, the problem with academics is that even ""archived"" science remains closed, not just the papers, but also the raw data.

It's easy for all 32 NFL teams to have the exact same ideas about how to measure playing ability. It's hard for thousands of clubs in hundreds of countries to all have the same ideas.

Career success can give you a great leg up in terms of attracting a life partner or supporting a family. But the simple, sad fact is that most work that actually needs to get done is just work. There are aspects of it one can enjoy, and aspects of it one merely tolerates as a means to an end--be it the fulfilling parts of the job itself, or just making a living. It's not necessarily a healthy or fulfilling place to focus one's passions and build one's life around.<p>Even Steve Jobs said that having kids was more fulfilling than starting companies and creating products. If you're a startup founder, there's a few ways you can go. You can spend a few years working very hard in the hopes that you get rich. Then you have financial independence, which solves a lot of problems and allows you to focus on doing fulfilling but less lucrative things with your life. If you're not going for a huge liquidity event, you can spend a few years working very hard in the hopes that you can create a successful and sustainable business which, hopefully, you can happily spend a good long time working at in a role you created to suit your own skills and interests, like ""CEO"".<p>There are always exceptions, and there's a romantic appeal to figures like Erdos, but it's a huge disservice and a huge sense of entitlement to expect a career, of all things, to take a central place in a happy and balanced life.",1319886492

PayPal will do the same if you are collecting any sort of payment information. There is just too much that can go wrong and it can be easily mixed up as being a scam or spam (which it sort of is, if you think about it).<p>You don't want to be banned from Google (or PayPal) - they carry that against your name forever, even if you later signup as a company or with a different account.<p>Second, this can only help you in a market where your potential customer knows what their problem is and knows to look for a solution. In so many cases of successful products this would not have worked. Not for Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Microsoft, iPhone, iPad or most any large and successful product.<p>It can also lead to false hope, or worse, an assumption that a product may not work. Twitter started out as a messaging system for cyclist couriers. If Jack had read Tim Ferris[1], took his idea to test the market with search engine ads, he may have come away unimpressed and believing there was no room for such a product - without even realizing the broader possibilities for such a messaging system.<p>It has become a bit cliche to quote Steve Jobs, but from his bio:<p>> At the end of the presentation someone asked wether he thought they should do some market research to see what customers wanted. ""No,"" he replied, ""because customers don't know what they want until we have shown them""<p>The better way to test the market is to actively market (as opposed to passively market - ie. having the market find you) - ie. go out and find your potential customers, the influencers in the market, analysts that cover the market, etc.<p>The whole idea behind minimal viable product is to lower the risk involved in testing a market - so get the MVP built and then promote it, but not just with search engine ads (the part of the market that knows what it wants, likely to be the smallest part) but also by actively reaching out.<p>The post suggests a budget of $20-50 a day just to get some leads, when with that sort of budget ($500-1000) you could just get a first version of the damn product built.<p>You can also find out how many people are searching by just using Trends or a similar product (keyword analyser). The PPC part just means you are paying $10 per email address - contacts that you may never end up using<p>I would like to see that similar posts to this one proposing this idea stress that results from search engine marketing are not the be-all and end-all. The language in this post suggests that the results of search engine marketing for a non-existant product conclude the viability of such a product:<p>> If you werent lucky enough to have a high conversion rate you can scrap the idea or rinse and repeat this process and tweak or pivot on the original idea.<p>This should say that your market may not be people searching for the product, not that you need to pivot the idea. This isn't how you validate startup ideas or products, it is how you validate part of a potential marketing strategy for a idea and product.<p>(Edit: and thinking about it, as a customer, I would <i>hate</i> this. If I were searching Google and comparing products that I need for a solution for and bumped into your product and gave my details, after your website suggested that the product exists - only to later find out that it * doesn't exist* - I would be very very pissed off about it. Especially if I needed a product right now and was falsely lead to believe that a solution exists).<p>[1] Tim Ferris is cited a lot as being one of the first to do SE testing (in '4 hour work week'), but I also remember Josh Kopelman writing a blog post about it a while before that as well. IIRC, Ferris suggests that you do this when you already have a product, to test potential new features, pricing ranges etc. The OP probably should have at least cited Ferris in his post, since this isn't exactly a groundbreaking idea and nor is it the first time it has appeared on HN.",1319886486

1011810,comment,1011373,1011804,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Sure.<p>Before I do, let me share the general theory about life - most people are decent people and want to help you if you're nice and a decent person. They don't want to get in trouble though, so you want to make it as easy as possible for the person. So, if there's multiple people there, you have much lower odds. People want to help out, but no one wants to get reprimanded obviously.<p>But let's say it's one guy or girl there. You walk up, smile, greet them, ask how their day/night is going. They say good, good, maybe you smalltalk for a moment. Be as personable, friendly, and courteous as possible.<p>They ask for your boarding pass. You have two choices now - hand them your boarding pass and just SMILE huge, or, say something along the lines of - ""Well, I'm flying Jet Blue today, but they don't have a lounge, and I always take British Airways internationally - I'd just like to grab a cup of coffee for like 20 minutes before my flight if that's cool, and I'd really appreciate it.""<p>Which to use? Kind of a judgment call. Handing them the pass with a big, guilty smile actually works. ""Go right ahead"" - oh my God, I love that, I feel like James Bond if I pull that off. But I did the Jet Blue thing flying out of San Francisco - I forget what airline lounge I got into, but it was legitimately one I flew a lot. Either British Air or something Star Alliance, Jet Blue didn't have a lounge, so I just told them that and asked nicely, the girl there waived me in.<p>Don't take it as a given, be friendly, and remember you're asking for a favor. You're not entitled, so don't be a jerk or demanding or act like you're royalty. Helps if you're dressed well, groomed well, and speak generally upper class English - nothing snobby, stay casual, just ""Good morning"", ""Good evening"", things like that - they want it to be a nice ambiance inside, so looking like you're not going to cause problems is critical. Again, most people want to help you, but you need to make it easy for them to do so.<p>So, be incredibly polite and friendly, and there's a decent chance of things working out. I usually try it if I'm an hour+ early, and I don't know what my success rate is - maybe 50%? Maybe more or less. It all comes down to the individual person at the counter, how their day is going, and how full/crazy the place is. If it's not very full, they're a nice person, and having a nice day, you've got a decent shot. Can't hurt to ask, at least.",1261557979

1011796,comment,1011328,1011702,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Your argument fails in two ways. First, 4chan does not operate any kind of Karma system (although theoretically, it could) so considerations of what is acceptable are moot; justbecause you can post something obnoxious and tired there doesn't mean you'll get a positive response.<p>To me, the main metric of acceptability at 4can is whether something gets a lot of positive feedback, which will only happen if it's funny in the temporary context in which it exists (and <i>everything</i> is potentially funny in the right context; yes, everything).<p>The second point of failure is not recognizing the significance of anonymous posting. In one sense it allows vandals and the irresponsible to shelter behind the 4chan Guy Fawkes mask, but in another it means that there is no particular gain for posting - whether it's outrageous, intelligent, or funny.<p>A post there succeeds or fails on its own merits, such as they are and such as the audience is at any given time. Sure, you can post cliche or offensive stuff of the form 'niggers CP niggers', but the only response you'll get is from other people who think along those lines, and you'll quickly fall off the end of page 10 (or 15 or whatever it now). Post something outrageous like a naughty comic nobody has seen before, and you'll get some feedback...but that won't help you tomorrow. Or indeed, 10 minutes later. Your critiques of people posting outrageous material to be cool and popular would make sense if there were persistent identities on 4chan, but the vast majority of participants choose to embrace the disposable nature of 'anonymous'.<p>I'm not arguing that it's particularly deep, although it can be. Rather, I am arguing that your criticisms of its shallowness are meaningless in a context where identity is not commoditized. People talk a lot of shit there, as we all know, but they also discuss things that they wouldn't if it weren't so easy do so anonymously.",1261557070

And what if you did get tech-blog validation/coverage? It would only encourage copycats.<p>That said, I like the idea -- one of the better StackExchange verticals I've seen. But to beat other similar sites -- perhaps even sibling StackExchange sites -- your initial community is all-important. The only successful 'launch' is one that brings the right kind of askers/answerers... and I suspect most of those people <i>aren't</i> rushing to check out 'launched' products; they instead stumble onto new sites by a variety of paths generally unaffected by 'launch' publicity.<p>And to echo other commenters: the design/color-scheme doesn't say 'stylish' to me, and I suspect for your audience, that could be important. (The dark purple makes me think more of a sports site, and the manila-yellow makes everything look like a field-needing-input.)<p>Can you follow the design cues of some emblematic sites in the fashion/beauty category?

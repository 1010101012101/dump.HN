337861,comment,337714,337764,0,0,ratsbane,,,"I liked it.  It isn't mean at all.  It's lighthearted and funny but it does address something I've thought about before.  Perhaps Vista isn't as bad as most people think but it certainly does have problems.  Instead earnestly promising to address any real issues Microsoft announced a $300m ad campaign to deal with it.  MS could have earned a lot more credibility and respect by admitting to perhaps even a small sampling of complaints and issuing updates to deal with them - but they didn't.  By trying to address these problems with a very expensive ad campaign MS effectively blames Vista users.  This Apple ad captures that in a lighthearted and funny way.  This ad makes me like Apple.",1224510819

And I think my knee-jerkiness has to do with what gives rise to populism you describe: the belief that something which is negatively experienced was designed to be negatively experienced.<p>It's a short leap to complete anti-managerialism once one sees malice (I am often guilty of this).<p>You're right: it's easy to drag out the guillotine without asking honest questions.",1224509484
337843,comment,337546,337700,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Britney Spears is a musician. I know it hurts to have to admit that, but it's true.<p>Moreover, when Britney is performing songs that are written by AIs (and how can we tell that this hasn't already happened?) she will <i>still</i> be a musician. If you think that singers are passive conduits of a composer's will, I invite you to visit an opera set and voice that opinion. (You can ask either the singers or the composer; it doesn't matter. Though if you ask the singers you had better carry earplugs, lest you risk being sonicated to death.)<p>I was actually thinking about Britney Spears at one point, in the context of my post. She strikes me as a prime example of one path that pop music will take in a world where, say, ABBA tunes can be written by a AI box that sits on my desk. One thing that boxes can't do so well is to perform a piece in which the musicians have simulated sex in the middle of the performance. Another is to simulate a complete nervous breakdown in the middle of a set. I've never seen Britney perform, either live or on video, but my understanding is that much of the drama of her act derives from anticipation of one of these events.<p>Of course, Britney Spears is only one facet of music (one that I frankly know little about). Another is jazz, which I tend to regard as another generation's solution to the artistic problem of abundant mass-produced music: Make each performance a unique, live, semi-improvised expression of the artist's technique, taste, and composing skills.",1224509025
337842,comment,337714,337795,0,0,Jem,,,"Well, it's been a while, but let's see what I can remember! I think, the fact that:<p>* I had to re-map certain keys on my keyboard just to get a usable # key/'real' British keyboard layout - it ultimately meant I had keys labelled as one thing that did another (thankfully I touch type)<p>* Pressing Apple + C or Apple + Z meant forcing my hand in to uncomfortable, unnatural positions - I prefer the spacing on a standard PC keyboard between Ctrl + C/etc<p>* Single button mouse - ew! First thing I did was buy another mouse.<p>* Navigating with the keyboard was all but impossible in many apps because the tab did nothing, or didn't behave in a logical way. Same with backspace.<p>* I had constant problems with crashing. It was an old G5 IIRC but my older VAIO laptop performed better.<p>These were just some of the things that annoyed me and reduced my productivity daily. Asking me for reasons why I wouldn't buy a Mac of my own would be another list on top of that, hehe. Anyway, I knew I was doing the right thing getting a PC in when my boss complemented my increased speed at my next annual review.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm a strong believer in picking something that suits your own needs/requirements. If someone thinks that a Mac is the better option, more power to them... I just don't like the stereotype that standard PC users are awaiting some sort of holy intervention from the God of Macs.",1224508982

Maybe I missed it, but in my opinion this was treated extremely lightly in the article. Instead it was all about the execution -- a sure sign that the point isn't a real discussion of the thing, but the popular feeling about the thing.",1224508877
337839,comment,337818,337818,0,0,smoody,,,"<i>""At best, your 'foresight' can result in wasted time, where you spun your wheels for a few hours (or days!) playing 'what if' and 'letâ€™s pretend', trying with too little information to think of how best to architect your code to accommodate that future feature.""</i><p>Actually, at best, your time was <i>not</i> wasted, your advanced-planning allowed you to be more agile down the road, and you saved the day. Don't be fooled into thinking that Jamis' 'best case' is everyone's best case. It's certainly not mine.<p>It's true that some people go overboard when it comes to thinking about future features they might need (guilty as charged...when I was younger). But, like anything and everything else, it's a skill. You do it, you make mistakes, you learn from mistakes.<p>What have I learned? Mostly I've learned how and where to focus my time thinking about future features -- determining which features are wheel-spinning features and which are likely to come to fruition. That skill comes with experience.<p>At a practical level, I've learned to carefully plan-out the hooks I'll need to implement likely future features. I don't implement the features, but I make sure I've thought through the API to get me there even if there's nothing behind it yet. Even that takes time, of course, but if properly focused, that time is time well spent. In many cases, it's well spent simply because it helps me to get back to the job at hand. :-)",1224508483

337831,comment,337628,337743,0,0,wynand,,,"Not every idea that is popular is populist. Evidence of popularity is not evidence of dubiousness. Populism plays to people's prejudices, but when people are the objects of some experience which they perceive negatively, it's something different than populism.<p>No doubt the idea of the performance review was meant to create a additional channels of communication. But human beings are human beings and things don't always work out the way they're intended (Communism being a supreme example).<p>If we are empirically honest, we should conclude that performance reviews don't work, whilst avoiding undue judgement of managers who are still compelled to do them.",1224508012

981505,comment,981349,981349,0,0,sdfx,,,"This question is not as stupid as it seems. True, your answer will most likely suck if you haven't thought about it previous to the interview, but this is probably true for most of the behavioral part. The interviewer is not looking for a boilerplate answer like ""I'm a perfectionist"" etc.<p>You have a good chance to demonstrate that you are self-aware and able to recognize your weaknesses and to show that you are working on them. It's probably not a great idea to name a huge deficit thats core to the job (e.g. ""I'm bad at programming""). Something like ""I'm bad with names"", followed by an example and a list of things you  do to remember them might be the way to go.",1260205127

I get along well with people and communicate well with coworkers, but I'm not that great at schmoozing at parties and whatnot, and so you probably wouldn't want me doing sales.""<p>This may be naive on my part, but I figure most people understand that (most) software devs are introverted anyway, so this isn't really a serious concern. However, it's a fairly honest answer, unlike ""I care too much"" or whatever. I've considered making ""My biggest weakness is that I've never come up with a satisfying answer to this question"" my answer, but that would probably come off as too snarky.<p>I agree with the parent article though. All this question does is test a minimal preparation for the interview game. Perhap's that's something, but there are better questions.",1260205093

First tell me some interesting stuff about them"".<p>I promptly forgot <i>everything</i> sensible to say about light bulbs but with a bit of prompting and some reminders we had a reasonable conversation - he even got up and taught me stuff on a white board.<p>At the time I though it went really bad but in the end his recommendation was a glowing one and I got the place.<p>When I revisited this memory a little while ago (when writing some questions for an interview I was conducting) it occurred to me that actually it was one of the best interviews I've ever been too. The subject material didnt matter too much at all (except that it was well within the limits expected of me) but it tested everything they wanted to know about me: subject recall, willingness to learn, interest in the subject, ability to actually understand the material etc.<p>They also got us to take a calculator apart as a group and talk about with a professor.

Most people with high skill levels are in the middle of a series of incremental improvements and also have numerous actual weakness.

They spend a lot of time trying to find the ""best"" way to do something before they start doing it. Really, just do something. You'll learn from the experience either way. You'll probably learn more than if you <i>had</i> found the maximal solution first.<p>I probably learned more about programming by hacking together a simple role playing game in Javascript+DOM in 2001 than my next 3 years of college and 5 years of work. That 8 year old code still worked up to the point GeoCities died, and then it was gone permanently. Not a big loss, but it was nice to see that it survived a myriad of browser updates. I learned tons about what made good, readable code just from having to live with it. I learned a lot of the art of optimization because of how much Javascript sucked at the time. But more importantly, I learned that it was more important to get-it-done than to be working in what was popular (you would not believe the flack I caught for not using C for it, even though I was also learning C as well and just wanted to do something in Javascript).",1260204665

And I go on to explain that I am unable to engage in heads-down focused programming for extended periods of time without mental breaks because of my personality.  I point out that most of the public is extroverted, but most programmers are introverted and I explain the reasons for that.  Then I say that despite this handicap I am a very productive programmer.<p>My answer is sincere, honest and true.  Furthermore I set proper expectations around what I am like as a person.  The fact is that I <i>am</i> extroverted, and I <i>will</i> need those mental breaks.  If they are unwilling to accommodate that, then I don't want to be there.  And I've found that letting people know it up front makes it easier for me to get those breaks down the road.<p>So I believe that the right answer to this question for you is to bring up the issue that you suspect you'll most need to be accommodated on if you get the job.

Do you believe Node.js can handle that kind of load?<p>I'm probably going to extend this exercise by switching from the default contrib library networking and standard java.io, and instead use netty. I'm told that can give me superior performance and scalability, and I don't think it'd take much more code. But the rest of the code should be fine. I'm quite certain, from profiling, that the core data structures can scale to thousands (and even millions) of users. Clojure's refs and agents are extremely well-implemented.<p>But, I'm not sure the node.js version really would scale to thousands of users. Every time someone connected hits enter the entire user set is looped over, synchronously. I suspect this latency will add up. The reason that code is so simple and direct is that everyone is just executing slices in one thread. In my version, the rooms have a thread pool (implicitly), so it really comes down to how many user threads java can allow.",1260203645

Really. It shows that someone has put an incredible trust and investment into you, and they value your intellectual output.<p>Start a personal website to host your projects, make it available to the public.

The word Ghana even means “king”. I have given you two examples of kingships with a history of over 200 years from two different countries. Traditional leadership however do not resemble a president (since most traditional organisations were small).<p>> You pick a single example and then say ""that is how Africa is"".<p>You pick a few unsupported examples based on your belief. You seem to reject (without motivation) the countries I mentioned (South Africa, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, etc…).  In all of these countries several systems of traditional leadership that is hereditary, dictorial and fairly small is found (in South Africa’s case, more than 9).<p>> Africans are completely different.<p>This is a retarded statement. I bet I have met more Africans and had more interaction with Africans from many countries a month than you had in your entire life. Have you gone to Kenya for a holiday and turned into an expert?<p>> What type of absurd extrapolation are you making when you claim your limited experience is representative of the entirerity of the continent?<p>You claim your view covers the entire continent. I gave you several examples which clearly falsify your theory. There is a reason why African countries tend to have the same government structure and level of development. The simple reason is that they were at the same stage of development and there is cross-pollination of ideas and people moving.<p>Do you think that it was a coincidence that the whole of Europe had the same type of government structure for several centuries?<p>> that can support your view of Africa as a continent of savage chiefs that kill people (and then boil them in large metal pots likely).<p>I do not think this at all. What you doing is the strawman argument – you make a easy strawman and then knock it down.<p>The reason (as previously stated) why the governmental structures is early similar is because of the same level of development (and similar structures existed in Europe at some stage). I personally think that your view is more based on your political view than mine.<p>> It's making me angry, and people like you are not worth my being angry about.<p>Here you descent into personal insults.

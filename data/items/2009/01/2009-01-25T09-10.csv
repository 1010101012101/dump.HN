Most of the implementations I've seen are of the 'meh' type: buggy, boring, bloated. I'm a bit biased though since a colleague of mine ran away screaming from a highly-paid SAP job. 'Never again', he said.",1232877321
448974,comment,448875,448940,0,0,kristiandupont,,,"While I can't prove it, my intuition tells me that when I do TDD, my designs are much more flexible and my code is much more reliable. Stuff that I would have buried in one class is often split into smaller classes. This gives some overhead, yes, but the tests are well worth the effort.<p>>""If you must do testing...""<p>Are you suggesting that tests are bad in general?",1232876852

With Google, Wikipedia and YouTube, if you want to know something, you can get that knowledge more effortlessly with each passing day.  I think what's missing now is a rating system, a process guide to step you through it, and video conferencing to handle study groups, before we fully have a sort of Wiki-University.",1232875269

I think <i>personal computing</i> should exclude things most people may only do for work like programming, writing reports or filling out forms even if those kinds of things were often the ""killer apps"" for personal computers when they first appeared 25+ years ago.<p>These days personal computing is more about the seamless integration of processing with personal and social activities which is why companies like Apple, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc are doing well.",1232874755

The buses seem like they'd work well enough and were fine the couple of times I used them, but biking is faster and more fun.<p>I think Dallas and Houston have Austin beat in terms of public transit. Dallas has plenty of rail, Houston has some rail with a lot in the works, and Austin has a commuter rail line that's about to open but doesn't actually get you anywhere without transferring to a bus that will be stuck in traffic. There's more to a good transit system than rail, but it's the best indicator I have since I've only used Austin's system in Texas.",1232874323

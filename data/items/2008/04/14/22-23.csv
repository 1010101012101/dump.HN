163574,comment,163552,163552,0,0,attack,,,"So the biggest gap is between angels/yc clones and VCs? It appears that there is a far bigger disparity between potential startups and angels who will fund them. This may be hard to grasp, depending on where you sit, but there is still a truly microscopic percentage of the workforce that gets in at the ground floor of a startup that gets funded by outside angels.<p>This is to say that percentages are what should be considered in measuring ""ease"" of getting an investment at each stage. 0.001% of groups that desire an early stage angel investment can get it, 30% of angel funded groups can get a successive intermediate investment, 50% of the groups that make it to the intermediate stage can get VC money, etc.",1208213878

163566,comment,163429,163545,0,0,palish,,,"The ""delete all of a user's files"" example was just one of many.  It is sometimes valid to force a crash when the code detects an impossible case (or when you choose not to recover from that case for simplicity).  If each component either functions correctly or the program crashes, that can significantly reduce debugging time.  There aren't any silent failures from components that simply ignore invalid input.<p>That said, with procedural languages I try to write code that recovers from all reasonable cases and assert the rest.",1208213317

163560,comment,163477,163553,0,0,raganwald,,,"Weeeell... There is a back-story here, as evidenced by teh links he provides. I think his view is that there is a very misleading debate between Ruby/Python and Java/C#, with much strawmanning on both sides, namely that all dynamically typed languages are like Ruby and Python, while all statically typed languages are like Java and C#.<p>I think  what he is trying to say goes beyond ""What I like about Ocaml"" to ""What YOU like about Ruby can be had in Ocaml and have strong type inference to boot.""<p>Of course, his contention that people shouldn't assume static typing == Java ought to be familiar: Lispers have been crying foul that people shouldn't assume dynamic typing = Ruby for a while now.",1208212752

I think Ruby 1.9 is going to fix some of that, if I am not wrong.<p>On a tangent, I wish I was this organized when learning something. Most of my hacking is playing with it till it makes sense, and essentially throwing it all away, only to realize a few days ago that something I just tried (or learned) now escapes me and have no where to turn, and end up doing it all over again.<p>Anyone out here have a better way of documenting stuff they learn?",1208212111

Nagios (<a href=""http://www.nagios.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nagios.org/</a>) does this for networks (and is extendable for some other things). At my old job we used Hobbit (<a href=""http://hobbitmon.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hobbitmon.sourceforge.net/</a>) to watch our Java server instances (memory usage, etc.). There’s no reason why these monitoring programs couldn’t be used to monitor internal program statistics, as long as those stats were made available.<p>Generally you monitor from your internal network, and then provide some hook for the monitor to get information that’s only accessible from there. (SSH or a limited-access URL, etc.)<p>Monitoring programs are super-powerful and generally complex. Check them out — it’s a good skill to have when working with production software.<p>(I also posted this on the article.)",1208211695

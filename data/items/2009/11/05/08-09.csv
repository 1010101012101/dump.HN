923558,story,,,10,8,jacquesm,"Ask HN: Are you using SSDs already ?",,"Hello HNers,<p>It looks like we are about to say goodbye to magnetic media. The price difference right now is still definitely there, a factor of about 20...25. But the biggest drives are no longer magnetic, they're solid state (4T!), and prices are coming down very fast.<p>By my reckoning by 2015 or so we will think about our magnetic harddisks with the same fondness now reserved for CRTs.<p>Are you already using SSDs ?<p>What is your experience with them ? Positive ? Negative ?<p>How do you feel about the price/performance ?<p>What applications do you use SSDs for and for which things do you think magnetic storage will be a hold-out ?",1257411466

All the other stuff is just 'in the way' for me, I don't use any of it.<p>The issue is that everybody uses their phone in 'their' way, so which bits are useful change from person to person and we end up carrying all the functionality that we don't use along.<p>Some way of stripping out unwanted stuff might be the way to go here.<p>Or a basic model that you select those parts on that you want which then get downloaded.",1257411252

923551,comment,923335,923520,0,0,swombat,,,"I can point to a Clojure line that has similar characteristics (and I don't even know Clojure):<p>(+ 1 1)<p>Done. Clojure's awesome, right? No errors. That rocks, huh?<p>No. Even that line has the potential for errors:<p><pre><code>  1. You could have a typo (int z = 6; int x = 7;)\n  2. You could have misunderstood the requirements (it should actually be float x = 6.5)\n</code></pre>\nThe only possibility you excluded with this trivially simple line is:<p><pre><code>  3. An error in how you used your own tools (easier to imagine if the line involved pointers).\n</code></pre>\nPart of the difficulty of debugging is, you don't know <i>which</i> lines have errors in them. If you have 1000 lines, you potentially have to review them all to find the bug. If those lines are poorly compartmentalised, so that you can't heuristically find your way to the likely location of the bug, that is doubly the case. Conversely, if you only have 20 lines of code, then you only have 20 lines to read before you've definitely seen the line with the bug (whether you recognise it is another matter, which has more to do with experience, capability, and the clarity of the code).<p>Intention-revealing code does tend to be much, <i>much</i> clearer, though. (although I'll grant you it's possible to obfuscate code with malevolent intent).",1257410946

We spend a considerable amount of time writing our behavioural tests (we have around 1,700 for our large web app), but they have saved us countless times from having to track down bugs after deploying code.<p>There was an article published in the last few weeks which showed that teams who write tests spend 10-15% longer in the development process, but they also save 25-30% of the development process time by not having to fix regression defects.

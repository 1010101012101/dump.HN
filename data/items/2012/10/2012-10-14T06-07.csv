It's because this is sloppy, lazy thinking, and it has traditionally been used as a bludgeon to retard progress for the many in favor of the few.<p>If you are going to talk about how rich even the poorest American currently is so as to intimate that they shouldn't complain about their circumstances you have to answer one question: Why now?  Why is this standard of living reasonable, and an improved one not?  Why was it fair of them to make it this far, but any better would be unreasonable.  The entirety of human history has been one long story of progress, and at every time I am sure there have been people arguing that everyone has it good enough and working to allow more people to have ""more"" is wrong.  Why don't we just stop after the establishment of agriculture?  Hey, now people don't have to risk their lives hunting.  Why not stop after we create homes and settlements.  Now we don't have to live in caves.  Isn't that good enough for everyone? Why didn't we stop when we developed basic medicine? Why not after modern agriculture alleviated periodic famines?<p>Unless you can say why certain people deserve the standard of living they have right now, and why they also don't deserve a better standard, points like the one you are talking about are counter-productive, and usually used by people looking to keep more for themselves, and damn everyone else.  To accept otherwise would mean accepting that there is no argument for the standard of living in your country to increase either, and I am pretty sure you wouldn't agree with that.",1350197169

Just before the fall of the Berlin wall, so there was still soviet control of eastern/central Europe.<p>Anyway, I went to Budapest on that trip, and at the time it was common to be met at the train station by people offering a place to sleep in their homes for cheap.  Me and some guys  I was with at the moment took one of them up on the offer and went with him to his apartment, $15 a night for the three of us. It was a cramped little place, but in the city, so it was cool.  We stayed up late talking to the guy, and found out he was a doctor.<p>Which was a huge shock to me.  A doctor living in a tiny little place and letting tourists sleep on his couch for very little money.  That (and the flagship department store in Budapest being nearly barren by US standards) convinced me that the West had gotten some things right, at least.<p>The guy did have a lot of books though, and asked me to send him some science fiction books once I got home.

Teachers should be getting paid at least double what they are now, and I have no problem with teachers starting at high five figures like a web developer can. I don't know if this means they're underfunded, funded enough but in the wrong places, or what, but for all that teachers have to work under, it is criminal what they are paid.<p>What if, like say corn subsidies, teachers are guaranteed to be paid enough to be able to buy an average price house within a mile of the school they work at? What if we had to stop bombing one country, let's say Yemen, in order to pay for it? Rhetorical.<p>These are the most trusted people in society, much more so than the police and politicians, and should be compensated commensurate with both their responsibilities and experience.

To bounce back from that would have required a transformation unprecedented in history.  In fact, even knowing the history that followed, if I had been summoned back by time machine to advise the council about what to do to repair Venice's fortunes, I probably would not have been able to give them advice that would have worked, short of telling them about all the scientific and engineering discoveries that had been made since, and sending them off on a Riverworld-like future.",1350194724

We would be paying much more for iPhones if they were manufactured here.<p>> The government is an enabler of bad economic activity, but the capitalists are always the catalysts. Government regulations did not force Countrywide Loans to give $1M mortgages to people who lacked the resources to repay.<p>But that's exactly the point. They didn't 'force' banks to make bad decisions, but without the government's bad regulations, bad monetary policy, and bad fiscal policy, the housing crisis would have been much harder to come by.<p>I'm not saying the banks are not at fault for their poor decisions: I am saying that without the actions of the government, you would either have not seen the crisis at all or you would have seen a much smaller and less disastrous bubble and burst.<p>> Study the origins of the labor movement. Robber barons were/are very real.<p>It depends what you mean by robber barons.<p>Did certain businesses during the 19th century exploit workers and warrant the formation of certain labor unions in order to protect the workers? Yes. I'm not denying this.<p>Did the most successful capitalists in the 19th century make their money by exploiting workers, stealing from the poor, and adding nothing of value to society? Absolutely not. I'm not saying these men were angels, but these so-called 'robber barons' improved society by an incredible amount, far more than what unions have ever done, producing better and more goods at cheaper prices. The rising standards of living during the 19th and early 20th century were not a wholly a result of government intervention or labor unions, but instead _mostly_ because of technological progress and the ensuing gains in productivity.<p>And the labor movement is not without its fair share problems.  Much of the violence in strikes during the 19th century was caused by the unions. As well, you had a great deal amount of racism.",1350194603

Presumably the top of the top 1000 channels far outproduce the bottom, just like the top 1000 far outproduce the rest of youtube. Given such a distribution, what are the top few channels earning? 100,000 a month? 1,000,000 a month? Even more?<p>Other interesting questions: How much of that is profit? Relatedly, does it cost a prohibitive amount to have a highly successful youtube channel? Does amount spent on production each month correlate with amount earned, or do consumers care much more about the content than the production quality?<p>What is the median income of the top 1000 channels? What's the overall median income of active youtube partners? What's the median income of channels produced (primarily) by a single person?<p>Some of these questions should be answerable by looking at available stats, like views for the top couple of channels versus the lower end of the top 1000. (Are the actual channels in the top 1000, preferable ranked, available somewhere?) I'll see if I can answer any more of them in the morning...",1350194564

798758,comment,798536,798638,0,0,jrockway,,,"""TCP is a leaky abstraction because it can't recover from cut network cables.""<p>OK, technically true, but the issue is the scope of the abstraction, not that it is leaky.  You could say that C is a leaky abstraction because C programs don't work if you shut off the underlying CPU.  Technically true.  Completely irrelevant.<p>C can't control your power button.  TCP can't control crazy people with scissors.  Both are out of the scope of the abstraction; inside the scope of the abstraction, TCP ensures that packets arrive in the correct order, and C ensures that your program can work on a variety of CPUs.<p>Finally, I don't think that ORMs are leaky.  With enough effort, all object graphs can map to a relational model.  Most people don't want to exert that much effort, but that doesn't mean object/relational mapping is a leaky abstraction.  It doesn't really mean much of anything.<p>(I agree that polymorphism and graph structures are hard to model, and that's why I generally use object databases.  But that is mostly irrelevant.)",1251835160

That tangent was orthogonal to the syntactic elegance you wanted to highlight.<p>Of course, if that sort of thing was a core design goal from the outset it damned well should be more elegant!  It's much harder to bolt closures on to C, and a bit of syntactic elegance had to be traded off to make it happen, no doubt.   I'd say they did a fine job given the constraints.

Although some of the tactics expressed in the interviews make me shake my head, many more have been entertaining and informative.<p>It's always interesting to see people's reactions when they see how the sausage is made in the kitchen (look at this thread). This is especially true when it comes to businesses in highly competitive markets like cars, computers, coupons, software, tickets, finance, marketing and insurance. Many big brands are just as guilty as anything this guy talks about (e.g. AOL's love.com, BMW SEO spamming, the shady stuff that goes on with Google PPC, the amount of paid links almost any consumer-facing Fortune 500 co buys). They're usually just better at PRing a cover up and/or keeping it behind the curtains. It's one of the joys of being a public company: massive consequences for failure to satisfy short-term earnings expectations and a huge incentives to employ shady tactics to ensure that doesn't happen.<p>Edit: Here's an example more closely related to venture capital.

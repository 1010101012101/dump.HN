However, the headline strongly indicates that it was submitted here to smear Sun. <p>Firstly, the headline is at odds with the conclusion in the article; the article states that they would have preferred Sun's updated (fixed) product if it had been released at the time. <p>The headline takes one specific company's experience with one specific product and generalizes it to cover the vendor's entire storage product line.<p>The comment poster, Onethumb, has never commented or submitted to this site before.<p>I have no affiliation with Sun.",1179342436

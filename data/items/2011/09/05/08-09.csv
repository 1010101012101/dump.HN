The entire of the Python standard library, along with your framework and other libraries, are shared overhead between all the threads.<p>The issue with charging by CPU hour was that you could occupy memory-seconds as much as you wanted without charge; that's no longer the case - by charging for instances, we're implicitly charging for the memory they use.<p>As far as determining how many instances you run - you can do this to a large degree, both by setting budget limits, and by setting scheduler parameters.",1315212196

Instead, you should force a big risky fight in which your opponent has a substantial chance of losing, if that's possible.<p>Along similar lines, chess grandmaster John Nunn wrote, in <i>Secrets of Practical Chess</i>, that when you are down, you have two basic strategies: ""grim defense"" and ""create confusion"".  If you are, say, a pawn down, it may still be possible to draw if you make no mistakes; your opponent will have to work hard to force a win, and he may even get impatient and try to win quickly with a risky strategy; this is ""grim defense"".  If that strategy is unappealing (if his advantage is simple to consolidate and exploit, or if you don't feel like slow and careful defense), then you may opt to do risky things to create complicated, high-stakes positions and hope your opponent makes a mistake; this is ""create confusion"".",1315211898

Sal Khan teaches maths, astrophysics, economics, history, etc etc...<p>The potential for misinformation from someone who is teaching a subject that they are not an expert in, and have just ""understood it quickly"" is quite worrying. he has been criticised on this before, see <a href=""http://www.nas.org/polArticles.cfm?Doc_Id=2029"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nas.org/polArticles.cfm?Doc_Id=2029</a><p>Economics is a lot like maths, and there is crossover so it's no surprise that he is good at both.

If you were just laid off, then the number one thing I would do is ensure that your performance reviews are all good and that nothing has been changed, or that he didn't add something improper to your reviews.<p>Contact HR and ask for a copy of your performance reviews, and then leave it at that.  If you can leave with severance, collect unemployment, and have a good performance review, I guess that's about all you can do.<p>If you are being terminated with cause, then in many states, including CA, they need to have given you warnings about your performance, otherwise they can't terminate you with cause.  You can probably approach HR about this, and if they don't give you severance, you could probably approach a lawyer.<p>Bottom line though, as someone else said, he lost and you won.  It sucks, but there's nothing you can do about it.  It's a hard lesson but probably something you'll learn in the future, which is don't bicker with your boss.

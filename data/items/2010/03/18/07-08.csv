The idea of being stuck somewhere with not just your parents but a variety of other relatives sounds oppressive and claustrophobic.

1200738,comment,1199993,1199993,0,0,pilif,,,"Some of these differences in numbers come from how git works in general.<p>A push is basically just uploading your repository to the remote server. As such a push might contain many commits by the person who pushes and others by different people - many of which are also part of other pushes.<p>Also due to the decentralized model of git and the model of pulling code from other people, it's highly likely that some (most?) of these pushes/commits never end up in the official repositories of the different projects.<p>Pushes may contain commits to throwaway branches, to branches for private use.<p>Also, the blog post doesn't say anything about rebases. If I push a rebased private branch, it will contain all the commits of the branch but with changed IDs.<p>There are so many more occasions for a commit to be moved around over the network in git than there is in the more centralized solutions as they are provided by Google Code and Sourceforge.<p>Yes. Google Code does provide Mercurial, but it's still project centric. So what gets committed to google code is official code that is part of that projects code base.<p>What gets commited to github is mostly throwaway stuff or patches about to be processed before being merged into some mainline.<p>This is where the difference comes from. It's just natural.",1268898948
1200737,comment,1200389,1200708,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, you'll notice I was talking about the point of view of a browser vendor, because H.264 licensing is irrelevant to that use case: the right thing to do is delegate to the operating system's media framework, and let codec support and licensing be the OS vendor's problem.<p>But since you mention it:<p><i>MPEG-LA could just have said ""Alright guys, browsers are free of charge, go ahead with HTML5, we'd like to see our codec in HTML5"". Afaik, they didn't.</i><p>Personally I'm against having HTML5 specify <i>any</i> codec of any sort. HTML 4 and XHTML 1.0 are each over ten years old now, and HTML5 won't be broadly usable as a replacement for at least another year or two; given the rate of development in video codecs, mandating one in a spec with that sort of expected lifespan would simply be stupid.<p>But it's worth pointing out that MPEG-LA is currently exempting H.264-encoded online video from royalties (so long as it's provided free of charge to users -- hence YouTube and other video sites don't have to pay every time a video is played), and will continue to do so until at least 2015 (by which point the whole question of software patents may be moot), so rushing to draw lines in the sand now is -- as I already said -- rather premature.",1268898923

1200731,comment,1200488,1200488,0,0,cowmoo,,,"I think your analysis is correct despite of all the self-congratulations that goes on here on Hacker News.<p>A couple caveats though; I think your definition of technology is too narrow, Web 2.0 is only one segment. The smartest people have moved on from IT which has already matured, and are working on green tech and genetic therapy where supposedly the next break through will come.<p>Also, even in software since money seems to be the biggest concern to you, consumer-centric software isn't where the money is made - it's just what appeals to be the most sexy to the young & naive. High frequency trading, e-discovery, medical informatics, Sarbones-Oxley compliance modules - there are tons of enterprise software companies in those fields make revenue more than most of the Web 2.0 startup's you listed.<p>Finally, I don't think what motivates programmers aren't necessarily the same that motivates a business-person. The best way I can describe this is by the musician and A&R example; there are some musician's who want to make it big and appeal to as many people as they can (i.e., Linkin Park), there are those complementary record labels who can help popular musicians by handling the business side and tailor their records to the focus groups. But there are also those musician's who care more about pushing than envelope than selling records, and if they are successful, like the early black blues & jazz musician's in the 40's and 30's, their influence will get heard in the 60's and 70's (ripped off by white musicians). Most people in IT operates on this sliding scale between craftsmen and A&R as well.",1268898482

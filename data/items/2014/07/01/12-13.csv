7970327,comment,7970039,7970039,2,0,Nanzikambe,,,"This is even more ridiculous than I thought, given TFA -- Microsoft could have just asked them to change the IP associated with the relevant accounts, disable update for them and/or hand over access to those accounts.<p>To quote myself from the other thread, the approach they did take is more than slightly bizarre:<p>&quot;There are serious problems with this, firstly that it&#x27;s technically impossible to implement effectively, beyond that it&#x27;s extremely impractical. Any benefit will be so so transient as to render the entire exercise pointless.<p>For the moment, let us ignore the scary implications of the court&#x27;s part in this and consider this from a technical perspective in a logical manner:<p>The hypothetical sub-domain abc.no-ip.org resolves to 1.2.3.4, a host somewhere that contains malicious payloads, is botnet C&C or is a member of a botnet. In any case, he&#x27;s the bad guy - one of the people Microsoft are looking to exclude from the Internet.<p>So how can this be accomplished? Let&#x27;s ignore for the moment that the bad guys are free to use any other dyndns service they please and assume that no-ip is the only one.<p>Approach 1<p>----------<p>Every time a host connects to no-ip to update its IP, Microsoft scans tcp & udp ports of the host looking for known C&C services, scans hosted data (public web or ftp). This will simply result in the bad guys hiding all of this in an undetectable manner, many bot-nets already use either Tor or SSH for C&C - without authentication it will be impossible to differentiate Joe Average with an SSH or Tor exit from the &quot;targets&quot;.<p>As for scanning for content, this is possible assuming the content has to be public (ie. malicious payload) but even then, it&#x27;s not practical - payloads can be hidden in anything and obfuscated beyond detection. Essentially all that&#x27;s accomplished is another arms race based around signature detection for malicious content, with the disadvantage that unlike AV solutions this scanning is conducted remotely and the scan source is known. So the malicious guy with 2 or three lines just uses a stateful firewall to point microsoft&#x27;s &quot;scanning service&quot; to good content, everyone else to the bad.<p>So what other options are there? A blacklist of IPs? Well, they&#x27;re dynamic IPs, sooner or later you&#x27;ll end up with every dynamic IP in the entire ipv4 range blacklisted as the bad dudes just release/renew.<p>Then there&#x27;s banning the sub-domains/users! Also impractical because for each user and domain you ban, another will emerge.<p>Approach 2<p>----------<p>Microsoft resolves every request for abc.no-ip.org to their own service, all the time, this service performs stateful packet analysis before forwarding it on to the destination host. Impractical because you&#x27;re essentially routing all no-ip traffic via Microsoft and once again you can only filter what you can detect -- and once the requests themselves are encrypted, that becomes impossible. This is effectively a MITM attack.<p>All the while we&#x27;ve assumed no-ip is the only alternative, it&#x27;s not - and many others are beyond Microsoft and the courts jurisdiction. So ultimately the only way this &quot;approach&quot; could be temporarily feasible is if all Internet traffic were routed through Microsoft&#x27;s service. So effectively you need to give control of every domain, TLD, ipv4 and ipv6 range to Microsoft. Not workable.<p>Someone is bound to point out that Microsoft&#x27;s approach in this may be distributed, agents running on installs of their operating system which does address some aspects of my points above, but once again -- if Microsoft is capable of implementing effective detection on the workstation, remind me again why any of this is needed?<p>I must be missing something fundamental.&quot;",1404219433

But you said people who ban IA from their site could be criticized, there are plenty of other comments along those lines, and I just don&#x27;t see it. As advice, sure: if you post it on the internet, assume it will stick around forever, because that could happen. But still, there are personal public websites, if you know what I mean. They&#x27;re not secret, they&#x27;re not hidden, they are accessible to the public -- but they do not <i>belong</i> to the public, they are not like a public park or road. And sometimes, a website is more thinking aloud, or talking to oneself, than writing a book that then belongs to your &quot;audience&quot;.<p>Civility is a good keyword, and while this may be a bit of a stretch, imagine sitting in public cafés and writing down what people say, and then criticizing people for lowering their voice and turning their back so you can&#x27;t read their lips, even though you genuinely mean well, and just want to preserve daily public life for future historians. In general, this is what this attitude of &quot;the internet&quot; feeling entitled to whatever was ever posted anywhere feels to me. Maybe I just don&#x27;t get it, but I <i>really</i> don&#x27;t get it.<p>I think the question wether a private conversation should be recorded just because it&#x27;s in public, just because you can, is kind of a no-brainer, but here are ones I don&#x27;t have an answer to: Should an artist be allowed to make a performance and ask it to not be recorded? Should someone be able to hold a political speech and ask the same? For me the answers are kind yes, and no-ish... but what about political art? Are we allowed to try to influence people, and then try to erase the traces? Now that is tricky, and I may have ended up ranting myself into agreeing more with the IA &quot;side&quot; of the argument than I expected to. Because either something is personal, trivial in one way or another, or commercial and/or political. Personal things I think should be respected, but commercial and political things shouldn&#x27;t be, they do belong to historians. Well, fuck.<p>[this is why I &quot;blog&quot; bit, actually -- because posting stuff online makes me think harder about them than I would otherwise, I don&#x27;t even need an actual audience for that, just the possibility of one -- but that&#x27;s also why I don&#x27;t feel great about all of that floating around forever, it&#x27;s all rather temporary in nature, a process.. and the person who wrote stuff a year ago does not exist anymore, so why should the name of this current person be attached to it?]",1404218234

The Gödel sentences are less interesting; any model in which those sentences were false would be a model in which PA was inconsistent. Which sure, can exist (e.g. the &quot;self-hating theory&quot;, PA plus the axiom that PA is inconsistent, is a somewhat legitimate set theory with some interesting properties). So saying the Gödel sentences are true was not entirely accurate; rather, it depends which model we&#x27;re working with. But a model which declares PA is inconsistent doesn&#x27;t seem like the sort of model that we&#x27;d want to do physics with.<p>You&#x27;re right that there are &quot;larger&quot; theories that can prove the consistency of PA, e.g. PA + existence of a large cardinal proves the consistency of PA. But, per Gödel, no consistent axiom system large enough to contain PA can prove its own consistency. This is probably a lot less bad than it sounds though; after all, if we have some unknown axiom system T, and we have a proof in T that T is consistent, does that really tell us anything? Because if T isn&#x27;t consistent, then it can prove anything, including that T is consistent.",1404217692

Way better to talk on the phone.<p>So it just depends on your use case.

I&#x27;m not criticizing either way of doing things;  obviously, lowering prices straight out is better for the customer, and keeping revenue stable while just upgrading hardware is better for the provider.   Last time I lowered prices, I lowered prices directly, and just took the revenue hit.

I can almost guarantee that this idea came from their IPO investment house that is handling the IPO, I will have to dig up who is handling it, but this one seems to be right out of the play book of how to drive up the short term gains. Long enough for the institutional investors to flip their holdings while the numbers are still going up, but before the product rot sets in.",1320991138

3223593,comment,3222511,3223388,5,0,einhverfr,,,"Personally I prefer a division between ""loaf-women,"" (hlaefdis -> lady)  ""loaf-guards,"" (hlaefwaerd -> lord) and ""loaf-eaters"" (no surviving descendant word).  But then I always liked Anglo-Saxon literature.<p>This being said, the problem with the tea party is not that they don't recognize some of the legitimate problems in this country, such as the very incestuous relationship the government has with big business (a relationship which lead Adam Smith in his day to advocate invisible hand policies), but rather the fact that they advocate those same invisible hand policies which resulted in such great concentration of wealth the last time around.<p>BTW, concentration of wealth is a major issue, impacting everything from the living conditions of the lower class to national security, and the fact that the Western Roman Empire had so much more disparity of wealth than the Eastern Empire may have a lot to do with the fall of the Western Empire so much earlier.<p>Because someone is going to rush to argue with me here, let me lay out Prof. Wolfram's argument on that.  Basically he says that concentrated wealth necessarily leads to a narrow tax base because you can only raise sufficient money by taxing the super rich in a society with the concentration that existed say in the Western Empire.  This means lower tax revenues, which erodes military spending.  He points out that the Eastern Empire spent more on the military than the Western Empire raised in taxes.<p>So when the Tea Party says we need to broaden the tax base, I fully agree.  My only difference is that I'd note the only way to effectively do this is to address the issue of concentration of wealth.",1320990998

We have data on which matches are larger cities and we may hide some search results when there is a broad match based on the difference in size between the city matches.<p>For example, if you type in ""Vancouver"", there is a much higher likelihood you mean ""Vancouver, BC"" than ""Vancouver, WA"" due to the significant difference in the sizes of the cities and their ""importance"".  In traditional lists, both would be listed with Vancouver, BC on top.  We're thinking of hiding ""Vancouver, WA"" unless the user continues to refine their input to ""Vancouver, W"" then ""Vancouver, WA"" becomes the most relevant result.<p>Something similar could be applied here.  Type in ""Ca"" and Canada should be the option shown until you add a ""m"" to make ""Cam"" then you will most likely show both Cambodia and Cameroon if their relative importance is too close to pick a clear top match.",1320990057

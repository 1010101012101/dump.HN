They have been contributing an amazing amount of stuff to the Ember.js communitynot least of which is helping us build Ember Data.<p>Probably my favorite thing about Ember is that it isn't built by academics toiling away in an ivory tower; it's driven by real-world problems that web developers are facing.<p>Our goal is to provide a set of tools that allow developers to build apps and not have to solve the same problem over and over. Displaying large sets of data is one of those problems, so this dovetails nicely with the mission of Ember.js. Thanks guys!",1356033579

There are certain explanations out there which have orders-of-magnitude differences in ease of understanding (seeing i as a rotation, seeing radians as the ""mover's perspective"", seeing integrals as ""better multiplication""). My personal mission is finding these aha! moments which unravel years of confusing symbol manipulation. Calculus is definitely more easily understood with infinitesimals vs. limits (ask any physics major or engineer).<p>Personally, I'm looking forward to a world where the very best explanations / analogies can bubble to the top. It's ridiculous that 200+ years after Calculus was invented, we still teach it poorly, and nearly everyone struggles.<p>Rigor & Intuition have a delicate balance in math. I see it as language: children can speak fluently, even if they don't know the ""rigorous"" rules of grammar & spelling [which are left to linguists]. I suspect the reason most adults have trouble learning languages is because they try to start from rigor (vocab lists and grammar structure) vs. absorbing an intuitive notion of what's going on (and later refining with rigor, ""me want food"" => ""I want food"").",1356033308

You seem to view food as a kind of art (and more power to you), but many people hold the very American view that food is magic. It's medicine for sadness, it's a symbol of manliness,  it's a aesthetic necessity--it's anything BUT fuel for your body.<p>Americans are very overweight, and the reason is that they somehow do NOT view food as fuel. If they did see it this way, they would use the right fuel to power the body correctly, and enough but not too much. That's unfortunately not the case.<p>What I can believe though is that many people who view food as an emotional companion don't have the refined taste that you have, and so they end up eating too much bad food that's also bad for them.",1356033291

Database systems that involve schemas seem to be mostly on a downturn in money spent on them because free alternatives are improving in quality and are becoming easier to support: not because their demand has slowed.<p>However, it isn't clear to me that companies making schemaless systems are really making any real money at all, and they seem to be marketing themselves towards people who don't even have budgets for database tools, and probably have no people dedicated to database administration. (Does UbiSoft even pay for CouchBase support? It didn't sound like it ;P.) Can you demonstrate in these other cases that Oracle, for example, was first used by people who thought it was ""cool"" and insisted on it being free, and worked their way up to ""people should pay $150k a year on this""?<p>FWIW, I really am curious about this, and would be perfectly happy being wrong. It just seems like a weird decision, and it isn't clear that it is base on ""the needs of people who have budgets for this sort of thing is or will change"" (which is what I'd argue was the case for ""eventually you will outgrow your filing cabinet and even your spreadsheets and yes, even your mainframe""; the business case for these earlier shifts was clear: ""large companies spend $Xm per year on record retention departments, those could be replaced by computers!""), as much as ""people who don't spend money on database systems at all find this more exciting"".",1356033079

Some hunting rifles are as efficient as an AR-15, and some aren't.<p>The ease of reloading a hunting rifle depends on the type of magazine it takes. Internal box or rotary magazines will be slow to reload, since you've got to feed the bullets into the magazine. (Yeah, a stripper clip speeds this up, but only so much.) But there's plenty of hunting rifles with external box magazines, which can be reloaded as fast as any gun with detachable box magazines.<p>A semi-automatic's a semi-automatic. There's no real difference in rate of fire once the bullets are loaded. (I suppose a heavier trigger pull might slow you down a little.)<p>Aftermarket magazine capacity isn't that different if you're using a box magazine, but the bigger the magazine, the more likely it jams, making the big magazine sort of moot.<p>It's true that there aren't many (any? I've never seen one) high-capacity drum magazines for hunting rifles, but personally I'd rather leave those on the market as a honeypot for idiots.

Good food, in that view, is anything where the taste isn't painful.<p>As a foodie, this pains me to see. You cannot cook anything good in a rice maker anymore than you can a microwave except, of course, rice. You cannot cook anything good with a bouillon cube (at bare minimum, buy some decent frozen stock from your local soup store) regardless of technique. Good food to me is worth the time it takes to make.<p>On the other hand, I can understand why people choose to optimize other parts of their life in this way. I constantly remind myself that not everyone wants to spend their Sunday making a quiche and an heirloom bean soup to eat for breakfast and lunch all week. Not everyone wants to roast a chicken every week, save the carcasses, then make a stock once a month. That's fine.<p>But I think everyone should experience it before settling for a life of rice-cooker meals.",1356032760

I posted for two reasons: first, I've never articulated precisely how I felt about Bush before, and second, I realized that it has a real explanatory connection to the patent problem. Ever since Bush started openly flaunting basic standards of decency it seems that many, many others have followed suit, and to devastating cultural effect. Myhrvold is just one particularly potent, obvious example.<p>Does stating that do any good, or help anyone other than me? Our sick culture of power makes modern venality feel like a scary, dark, unknowable trend that came out of nowhere and has no source and no solution. Connecting Bush makes it feel more like a normal (if unwanted) social trend that has ordinary, identifiable roots and solutions. I think we consistently underestimate the presidential influence on other leaders--perhaps because in our sophistication such influence feels cliche.

4949532,comment,4948082,4948082,13,0,haberman,,,"I have desperately wanted to understand the Fourier Transform and signal processing for a long time.  In high school I read every tutorial or book I could get my hands on, hoping that one would finally ""click.""  The very first thing I did when I got to college was approach the CS faculty and ask for recommendations for literature that would help me understand it.  My college didn't have a signals and systems class, but a few years later I heard that Richard Lyons's book ""Understanding Digital Signal Processing"" was supposed to be the friendliest book on the subject so I bought and read it.<p>I say all of this just to impress upon you that I was <i>serious</i> about wanting to understand this stuff.<p>Despite all the effort, the FFT and DFT were never more than opaque blobs of math to me, mysterious boxes that you put inputs into and could extract outputs from (albeit in a very obscure format that seemed to involve complex numbers for no apparent reason).  I sort of gave up and forgot about it for several years.<p>Recently I came upon Stuart Riffle's article (<a href=""http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2011/05/17/understanding-the-fourier-transform/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2011/05/17/understanding-the-f...</a>) which explained it in terms of the circular approach that this article adopts.  Rotate the waveform about the origin at the frequency of interest and average the samples, simple as that.<p>I am not exaggerating when I say that after 10 minutes of reading that article, I had an understanding that years of highly motivated knowledge-seeking had not given me.<p>I take a few things from this story.  One is that, given a specific learner (ie. me), some ways of explaining things are infinitely better than others.  I mean that literally, because this new, circle-based explanation gave me an understanding that I literally was not capable of achieving with all of the symbolic and algebraic explanations I had studied previously.  Judging from other comments I've read, I'm not alone in this, which says to me that there could be exciting advances ahead of us in the way we learn.  Just as the Khan Academy is making learning more accessible, I hope that it could also help discover and widely disseminate the <i>best</i> explanations for things.  Sal Khan is very good at explaining things but we can't expect him to think of everything.  This fantastic DFT explanation was created by a random systems/graphics programmer; I hope it will percolate into DFT curricula until everyone who is learning about the subject is at least exposed to it.<p>My other takeaway, though, is that hard-core math people really think in a fundamentally different way than I do.  I'm a highly intuitive thinker, and formulas are a sea of meaningless symbols to me without an intuitive understanding of what is going on.  That someone could understand the DFT <i>without</i> thinking in terms of the circular interpretation is amazing to me.  I now know that I am indeed capable of understanding the concept, but only by thinking about it in a different way than most math people do.  I suspect, however, that my intuitive way of thinking about it would be more difficult to formalize and make rigorous, so in the end I am dependent on the mathematicians and their way of thinking, even if I can't as easily understand things in their terms.<p>(One other example of this: I think calculus is simpler to understand in terms of infinitesimals rather than limits, but this is another example where the infinitesimals are more difficult to make rigorous).",1356032669

It's a concept that came as a reaction against a ruler make decisions based on his own opinion of what is right and wrong.<p>Yes, there is a place for a discussion of ethics outside of the current legal framework, and if the Constitution is found to be lacking in that area, then it should be amended. Until that happens, our government is legally bound to abide by the Constitution <i>as it is written</i>, and to judge whether or not that is happening, the document must be interpreted. One important aspect to interpretation of a document is to understand the circumstances under which it was written. To do that with a 200+ year old document requires a little knowledge of history.<p>The framers of the Constitution did not achieve perfection, but at least the idea of the ""rule of law"" does give us a relatively consistent and stable society in which to live. The disadvantage is that written law is static and cannot quickly adjust to changing circumstances. Ideally, we would have an enlightened leader who knew the right thing to do in every circumstance, and would govern with perfect justice.

Specifically:<p>- The ratings agencies...did not accidentally have bad underlying models.<p>He first talks about how the models were defective, and then goes on at length to describe the perverse incentives for developing and keeping these models, and holds the responsible parties to the fire for willful ignorance and unabated greed.  He could have made some of these points more strongly, but I don't think that he skirted over the real issues.<p>- the only goal of a modeler is to produce an accurate model.<p>Actually he speaks quite a bit about the reasons that various forecasters generate models in the first place, and their motivations and responsibilities.  For example, the Weather Channel's skewed ""wet"" forecasts.  They will, for example, predict a 20% chance of rain if their models show only a 5% chance.  On the one hand it is a bit dishonest, but on the other hand there is a net utility in doing so.  Part of the problem is that the general public doesn't understand what the percentages really signify, so it may be of some benefit to emphasize that it really could rain, it's just not very likely, so it behooves people to at least have some backup plan for rain.  The other side of this is that people will not remember the good forecasts as much as the bad, and the Weather Channel has business considerations in mind.<p>- He spends very little time on the question of how people act inside larger systems, where a given modeler might be more interested in keeping their job or getting a big bonus than in making their model as accurate as possible.<p>How much of the book do you suggest he devote to this?  He addressed the issue directly, as the next couple paragraphs state.  He also talks to quite a few institutional players at large organizations, both public and private.<p>- Having said all that, I have major problems with this book and what it claims to explain. In fact, Im angry.<p>Really, stop with the faux outrage, because you don't seem all that angry throughout the post, you more seem to be disappointed he did not devote the book to your own pet topics.  I find this kind of criticism to be mostly without merit.  For me, there were three overriding themes in ""The Signal and the Noise"": Bayesian thinking (this being the primary one), the goals and motivations of forecasters, and examples of what forecasters have done right and what they have done wrong.

That said I would venture a guess that none of your other banks are anywhere near on the same level as Simple.<p>I have been a Simple customer for a couple months now I absolutely LOVE the service. I have dug into what happens behind the scenes on their website and yes, they do pass more data back and forth than is always needed but they are using SSL so I'm not too worried.<p>You say you reached out to their security team and waited 8 days for a reply before following up, why didn't you just use Simple's support? I have reached out to them multiple times and always received a response within an hour. One of those times they redirected me to their engineering team so I could talk directly with one of their programmers, we exchanged 3-4 emails that same day. Should they have monitored this security email address you sent to better? Yes, but they provide the best support of any bank I have used in the past.<p>Pretty much I don't feel like the ""concerns"" you raised are all that important and in fact the whole post smells of FUD IMHO.",1356032170

I mean, it is clear the majority of stuff you read about is from people who don't like types, but honestly as time has marched on development has been ""democratized"" to a large extent... yet, if I think about ""people with both a lot of experience and a lot money who are willing to both pay for things to use and people to maintain those things"" (what I would call ""the market"" for a database solution) I see lots and lots of rigid types.<p>I mostly see ""schemaless"" from highly-popular (to the masses) database system where I don't really see much money being made or even moved (on database software). It could be, however, that I'm just totally misunderstanding how well some of these companies are doing. However, when I see a company evaluating things to plunk money down on, they seem to be 1) clustering support for PostgreSQL, 2) hosted management of MySQL, and 3) system administrators and licenses for Oracle.<p>In contrast, people providing NoSQL ""schemaless"" systems seem mosty to be living in a world where the developers expect everything to be free; they sell support contracts, but I never hear of anyone actually buying them... do a lot of companies do this? It also always sounds like a magical accomplishment when you hear one being used a large company with a lot of money (such as the developers at UbiSoft giving a talk on how they are using CouchBase at re:Invent)... I haven't heard RDBMS systems have to justify ""look, this company used us at scale and we worked fine"" in years.<p>Note: to be clear, I do hear of companies with ""NoSQL"" systems who have a lot of money, but they are all using Casaandra, HBase, or SOLR. SOLR let's you make define dynamic columns, but everything is still rigidly typed. HBase and Cassandra both have schemas with fixed columns; sure, Cassandra allowed you to largely ignore the schema, but if you've seen CQL3 they are actually nigh-into turning into an RDBMS: it is hilarious, and I think awesome. Even then, it isn't clear to me how much these companies pay money for their databases.<p>>  Changing around static types in your code isn't anywhere near as hard as changing around a static structure in your database because you need to modify all the old data to make it meet the new structure.<p>This is not actually true, as the structure can be metadata stored describing the data. When I add or delete fields in PostgreSQL, the operation is instantaneous, as is renaming existing fields. AFAIK, only MySQL sucks at this. The only time I need to do a table rewrite is if I change the datatype of an existing field, and I am pretty certain that you can also handle the majority of those cases without a rewrite. Even with the rewrite, you shouldn't have to block incoming queries.<p>It isn't like not having a schema fixes this, as there <i>is</i> a schema after all... my code certainly has an assumption about how the data is stoted. It just means I either a) can't change the schema at all, b) can change the schema, but have to do so by doing the table rewrite manually, or c) can manually implement the metadata behavior (but then why not just add this to the database server). Given how the patterns one uses to solve these problems don't really rely on the data being stored, it simply makes sense to standardize them in the database server.",1356031546

4949424,comment,4947970,4949078,4,0,gregsq,,,"There's so many aspects to that question, but I'll have a go.<p>The first thing to point out from the materials aspect is that there are compliances everywhere with vinyl records. They are essentially lubricated with plasticisers which are needed to give some reasonable playing life given the accelerations involved. They also depend upon shrinkage in the pressing stage, the metal stamps engineered to allow for material relaxation. There is a slight shrinkage in cooling, and this helps shrink errors as well.<p>However, these processes lower fidelity. The original masters, or even direct to disk recordings, use chiselled stylii driven by a high precision lathe and electromechanics to carve the track in the material. Corrected phasing, given that a difference in track lengths is present between left to right, is also performed.<p>So materials that could do with some annealing after deposition could help, at least until higher resolutions become available. Following a correct RIAA curve of course matters and using a steep low pass filter rather than down sampling an already phase damaged mp3 would help.<p>At the moment all this is hobby stuff though. Allowing material reflow would probably be the best way to preserve the life of the stylus and reduce noise. It's first playing will be carving off the printer resolution deposition errors.",1356031465

But there's another aspect of it that I think is worth mentioning. Right now RethinkDB has a very limited number of types that it can return, it's limited to JSON types so basically just object, array, strings and numbers. There are several other types that could be encode as these but you're going to wind up needing to do conversions when you insert and extract this values from the database. For example you might wind encoding and RGB value as an array of 3 numbers and your code will wind up looking like:<p><pre><code>    table.insert({""color"" : colorToArray(c)}).run()
    arrayToColor(table.get(...).run()[""color""])
</code></pre>
This obviously is cumbersome. This is the type of problem that an ORM seeks to solve. However ORMs have the big flaw of being limited to a single language and needing to be kept in sync with the database. If you did this in the database layer by having the driver convert the color object to a tagged array then it would know to return it as a color object rather than an array. Other languages could do it too using the same database since they would see the tag and could convert it to a color type in their language.",1356031118

Hypermedia is like dynamic typing: it all happens late bound, it's flexible, and open to change.<p>> the code to actually do something with it is, and that's where my spidey sense starts tingling<p>Here's one of the simplest examples I can show you: the 'hypermedia proxy pattern':<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/3172911"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/3172911</a><p>Here's the core of the code: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/3172911#file-client-rb-L27-L37"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/3172911#file-client-rb-L27-L37</a><p>This says ""parse the links out and save them. When I try to load a name, if it doesn't exist, go fetch it from the link pointed to by 'self.'<p>This allows you to change the client behavior by modifying the server: by compressing or expanding responses, the client makes more or less requests without changing its code.

OP might want to edit it to remove any ambiguity.<p>I read an AMA on Reddit at one point from a guy who worked as a server engineer on some large porn website/network. The questions were mostly about engineering, but the answers were fascinating - when you think about it, porn networks have to face the same scaling issues as many startups, and they have some unique challenges (and also advantages) that other markets don't.<p>I was secretly hoping this post would be something along those lines.

I loved the course, myself, and would jump at a chance to take the next one in the sequence.  Given the web format, I think shorter, easier to master units of learning are probably the way to go, and this course's high completion rate supports that.<p>But when comparing it to other course's completion rates, you need to keep in mind that there simply wasn't that much to complete.",1356030199

Both approaches come with their pros and cons and their impact varies from project to project.

For the time being I think people that use non-relational databases and requiring type checking are implementing it in the database access layer. But there's no good reason why it couldn't or shouldn't be supported by the database itself.<p>1. schema vs no-schema: IMO these two represent the two ends of a spectrum where what I think would actually make sense is support for optional schema definitions--in a way this could be similar to the way Protocol Buffers/Thrift/Avro define their protocol.<p>alex @ rethinkdb",1356030129

But are you honestly arguing that just because 28 ppl die due to guns every day while 6755 ppl die due to heart disease, cancer etc, we should stop talking about the 28 ppl ? Say that 1 more time? It is not about the numbers. It is about <i>how</i> those 28 ppl are dying vs. the 6755 ppl. Cancer: enough research/actions are being taken and going on. Heart disease: plenty. Ppl have a choice there with lifestyle etc to an extent. What choice do I have if someone comes at me with a semi-automatic gun ? Is that my fault ?<p>""Let's ban cars instead of guns""<p>Even if you say this 1000 times, it does not change the fact that you are comparing apples and oranges. Yes ppl die to due to car accidents but until ppl start using cars to mass murder 26 ppl like sandy hook, stop using this analogy. Try running over 26 ppl at once with a car in a matter of minutes and see how far u get. Try the same with an semi-automatic gun.",1356030003

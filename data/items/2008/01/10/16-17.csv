We are committed to creating the best Customer experience possible. One of the first ways we can demonstrate our commitment to this goal is to quickly and efficiently address your recent request.<p>We want to make sure that our customers do not lose the domain name to disreputable individuals (or entities) that snatch up domains after a domain search has been made.  Network Solutions, along with many other registrars have received numerous customer complaints of domain names being registered by someone else, typically outside of the United States, just minutes or hours after someone else has conducted a domain name search at a registrar site, performed a WHOIS query, or typed a domain in the browser to see if there is an active Web site.  The industry calls this practice domain name ""Front Running.""<p>To thwart the efforts of these sneaky individuals, Network Solutions reserves unregistered domains for up to four days from the date they are searched on our Web site. This customer protection feature provides our customers the opportunity to register names at a later date without fear that the name will be registered by the ""Front Runners.""  If the domain you searched is available and one that you really want, we suggest that you register it immediately to ensure that you will not lose the name.<p>Please do not respond to this E-mail. If you have any additional questions, you can reach us via e-mail by completing our online form at <a href=""http://www.networksolutions.com/en_US/help/service-request.jhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.networksolutions.com/en_US/help/service-request.j...</a> or by phone at 1-888-642-9675 and provide Service Request # 1-321287601.<p>Thank you for choosing Network Solutions.<p>Sincerely,<p>Arlan001\nNetwork Solutions Technical Support Specialist<p>(c) Copyright 2008 Network Solutions, LLC.

I'm currently kind of in the same situation, except I just started Business School and I have been full-time developer and occasianally a entrepenuer over 4 years.<p>What happened to me was that I got tired of hacking little things. I never kind of had the time or motivation to learn any advanced cs or math(since I suck even in basic math).<p>I didn't choose CS school since I got quite a variety of intrests(like business, economy, arts, cs...) and I'm not sure that I have such a burning desire to be a hacker, or work as one, but I still want to learn more.",1220784706

297429,comment,297200,297200,0,0,pmjordan,,,"The problem with long-running tests, however, is that they don't reflect real-world, in-browser use of JavaScript. If your browser doesn't respond for half a second because your JavaScript is doing some computations, then your users aren't going to be happy. DOM performance must not be forgotten either, along with rendering speed of said DOM changes. That's not so easy to benchmark, of course.",1220783985
297428,comment,297101,297320,0,0,froo,,,"But the difference is that these sites are more or less niche sites. People will use them regardless of design, as that's what tech people are like.<p>However, Some of the sites linked are poor - it would be prudent to look at the sites linked in more detail (ie more than just a glance at the home page) before deciding to attack Scoble.<p>For example, the Plastic Logic (sorry if anyone here works for them, but I'm just trying to show something) is very poorly designed. I'm actually surprised that a company that is ""technology related"" would launch a new site that is circa 1995 web design.<p>Clicking through to the product page shows an image that is roughly 200x300 that takes an incredibly long time to load. Upon further inspection, it turns out to be 10 times larger (a 2.25mb file) that these guys uploaded and resized with html instead of resizing in a graphics utility.<p>I honestly don't know anyone who would do something like that anymore.<p>I think the way Robert handled his post could have been more professional, especially since there may be a conflict of interest with him judging at TC50, but he did have a point - some of the site designs were not in line with some of the markets they are trying to attract.",1220783631

297424,comment,297049,297349,0,0,timr,,,"Because it allows you to maintain clean abstractions, which is essential for big projects.  The ultra-permissive model of programming (the current fad) is great when the entire codebase can fit in your head, but it fails completely when you're working with anything larger.<p>For example, every substantial Rails project I've seen has had views that have degenerated into messes of bizarre spaghetti logic (which, in turn, interact with the bizarre spaghetti logic in the controllers, in bizarre, noodly ways).  This is mainly due to the fact that there's virtually no enforcement of abstraction boundaries in Rails -- views can directly manipulate the models (whose methods and data are essentially world-writable), which are obtained via instance variables on the controller, which are always implicitly available to the view.  Mix in things like shared partials, locals and layouts, and Rails code quickly becomes a maintainability nightmare.",1220783207

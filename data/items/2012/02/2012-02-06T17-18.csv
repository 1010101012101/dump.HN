3558415,comment,3557705,3557705,9,0,startupfounder,,,"The lesson of Moneyball is to 1) do what you love/what you are good at and 2) purchase undervalued assets.<p>This is the same strategy that Warren Buffet has been using for decades.<p>The perception is high risk because you are going against the status quo, but in reality you are in a low risk senario because you are doing what you love and you see an undervalued asset.<p>In the startup world it is the same thing. If you are doing what you truly love/what you are good at and you can identify undervalued assets then you will win in the long term.<p>For employees this is finding a company that you can calculate that it will succeed, then getting stock in that company by ""taking the risk"" and it all works because it is something you deeply care about.<p>For founders this is finding an area that is ripe for disruption with a problem that you face in your life. Starting a company is a way to realize that value that other's are not capturing.<p>Really successful companies, founders, employees and investors do what they love, love the ones around them, pay respect to everyone and can brutally identify undervalued assets.",1328551192

3558408,comment,3556819,3556819,0,0,DaveGalt,,,"Reading in word-groups has always been the key to reading faster. BUT, you have to concentrate on MEANINGFUL GROUPS. The secret is learning to see the ideas VISUALLY. If you concentrate on visualizing the ideas in meaningful groups of words at a time, the reading becomes more meaningful, more like WATCHING a movie than LISTENING to a story. And verbalization will fade away on its own.
I could describe this better, but I'm typing this on my little Kindle screen.

The application domain matters, but just as in other professions; you can't pretend that ""electronic engineer"" means nothing, you can't prented that ""neutronic engineer"" means nothing, even if you don't know if the first one is currently designing electronic boards for missiles or set-top-box, and if the second one is currently designing nuclear weapons or civilian reactor, or doing some radioprotection work.<p>In that sense saying ""programmer"" means nothing because there are lot of different programmers with various background and levels is an implicit depreciation of professional highly competent programmers capable of working on <i>anything</i> related to computer programming (and even in a lot of cases, beyond computer programming).<p>Having learned mathematics at school does not makes me a mathematician, even when I am using that math knowledge in a project, and not more than commentating about a book with friend makes me a literary critic.

However, me downloading movie doesn't represent lost revenue for Hollywood - if I were forced to pay for a movie, I would simply do something else.<p>This is what I think goes over the head of Hollywood execs.

I use it because as the OP mentions, it's better than pirating. Instant, convenient, and the cost is a non issue. Why doesn't Hollywood embrace this rather than oppose it?

Which is particularly interesting as it's hard to see on the surface where their margins come from on a device most could consider as novel and expensive.<p>Though there are potentially gains to be had from a smarter thermostat, the headline figures in their white papers will most likely never be realised in the real world. Most reviews and bloggers seem to get caught up in focusing on the simple heating and cooling experience.<p>The company on makes sense once you look at it in the context of the larger market. The silent but important features are zigbee integration (current unused), and excessive processing power. We are just on the cusp of huge smart-grid rollouts in many western countries.  British gas in the UK has decided on the zigbee standard and are starting to roll out over 1000 new meters a day; with government backing for an 11bn rollout to 27 million households by 2019.<p>In light of these rollouts, the energy companies will be looking to capitalize on their investment (which will be mostly funded by the consumer, via higher bills). The hardest part is figuring out what the consumer face of the smart grid should look like. Expensive 'home hubs' and touch screens are a red herring - the future is distributed (every household members phone etc), yet you still need a link between the rather 'dumb but integrated' meters, and devices in the house.<p>In my opinion nest's game plan is to become that link. Your thermostat controls around 50% of the energy usage in your house. Eventually it has the potential to control 100%. With smart GPS integration into your phones it becomes realistic to have houses that react silently to it's various inhabitants patterns and blend those needs with the energy grids demand levels; now this is a valuable proposition.

You've just killed performance, your page is probably going to have laggy response and all kinds of event listener issues crop up as you keep working, leading to you using .die, .stopeventpropegation, .stopeventbubbeling, and return false all over the place in a futile attempt to manage your events.<p>jQuery does a great job of letting you write less code, it also does a good job of abstracting away tasks and making things look like ""magic"", but it also <i>really</i> makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot, with a tommy gun.<p>jQuery creates a lot of undesirable effects, as far as I'm concerned:<p>- People don't understand what their code does.<p>- jQuery API is a mess, and version upgrades are hard<p>- Best practices for a given task are not focused on, rather, ""every practice"" is accepted, and whatever blog post the JS novice read at the time becomes the method they write their code with (as a result, we almost never see .delegate() in use)<p>- The library is huge. Yes, they brag about it being only 31kb minified, but that's huge!<p>- jQuery code is <i>slow</i>.<p>- Nobody understands how the DOM API works any more, and because sizzle makes it easy to select complex things the authors don't even bother writing semantic HTML, so we start to see <td id=""Row2Cell2""> kind of things.<p>- We have landed in a mess where ambitious people tightly couple their projects with an unstable API and practices that create sluggish pages.<p>Sure, you can use jQuery correctly, but I'd rather use a micro-framework that complements JavaScript rather than attempt to replace it with tightly-coupled abstraction layers and memory hogging through event listeners and timers all over the place. The culture around it makes me really sad.",1328548196

The first was when I learned linear algebra and variable replacement and I thought to myself, that if it is all designed this is how the unknown becomes known. The other was the more profound and was when I first learned to code. I remember when it (programming logic) really hit me, I was in the bathroom watching the running water in the faucet. When I realized that with the natural laws of hydraulics and my own universe (the compiler and run time) I could build the same thing in another world. I then started to analyze everything in that form of logical pattern. I recall it vividly because it was an extreme moment of clarity in my life. It was also the point at which I questioned the realness of reality more. The more I questioned and read about the extreme edges of science like quantum physics, the more I questioned the realness of reality.<p>A while later, I read an article in which some individuals took computational theories that where belied to be the constructs of the human mind and not part of the natural universe, at least not part of them external to the computer they where designed on, they took these theories and went looking for them in nature to their surprise they found them, in many not only did they find them but many times there natural implementation was superior in efficiency and elegance to the one conceived of in the human mind.<p>Many times science discounts this kind of seeming connectedness of the universe by saying that it is unproven or coincidence which would be fine if they did not in the same breath say that philosophy is dead and that science has killed it. These mysteries in life are what keep me interested and I am glad that we have science, philosophy and theology as they all help shape the wonder-lust that is life.",1328548052

Historically it was used in much the same way as your Presidential pardons are (i.e. to get friends of the ruling elite out of prison or spare them the gallows).<p>In modern times we've pardoned people who we consider to be wrongly executed (including all soldiers executed for cowardice in the First World War) and people who have been wrongly executed for other crimes.<p>However, there is still a general principle that a pardon doesn't remove the original conviction but instead removes the punishment that was applied. So in the case of a miscarriage of justice there is a tendency to allow the conviction to be quashed by an appeal court rather than pardon someone (unless time is of the essence e.g. they are close to death and the appeal would take too long).",1328548052

I largely avoid taking notes on a tablet for this reason (this is behavior I could voluntarily change if I was more flexible on how I take notes), but why would I need pen input on a phone? I've never personally ran into an issue on a phone where I said ""this would be easier with a pen"". What are the use-cases for this and why would it appeal to people?<p>For me, the ad worked on the level that I'm now curious about why this pen is worth highlighting in a 3.5MM spot.<p>Regarding the insults to Apple users, this is something that is really divisive. I remember when there was a ""leaked"" BlackBerry commercial a few years ago that showed a black berry being shot through an iPhone. The spot turned out to be fake, or it got canned and never aired, or something like that. I remember there being a lot of people in the online tech community being upset over this. They wanted to see Apple bleed.<p>But that was never a good marketing strategy for RIM. I'm trying to think of the strategy behind this ad. Certainly, anyone devoted enough to Apple to stand in line for their products thinks enough of Apple to a) not switch and b) not to switch to a company who makes fun of them. Additionally, these people likely buy into's Apples stance on styli being antiquated.<p>So the other strategy may be to position itself away from the Apple ""fanboys"". Lots of people dislike Apple, and maybe making fun of those who do hit enough of a confirmation bias button to make them seriously think of buying this phone.<p>So overall, it doesn't seem like a great ad to get huge market share, but it does seem to be positioning itself firmly on a segment, and hoping it can draw in other segment share.<p>Personally, I don't get it.",1328547864

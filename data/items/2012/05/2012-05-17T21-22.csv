In this case if you go the CTR route, then you could still possibly use it for branding purposes but still have the click through try to funnel a person into a sale... makes me wonder if there is click fraud going on. Anyways if people don't click on ads, then you might be able to game the CTR route.",1337291992

3989344,comment,3988251,3988251,0,0,rprasad,,,"Lol. I just realized why people aren't understanding my other comments about why this debate matters.  Here's an explanation:<p>Capital gains on the sale of capital assets (i.e., stock) by foreign persons are not taxable by the U.S.  Only certain types of capital investment (i.e., real property or income that is connected to a U.S. business activity) is taxable by the US.  See generally Section 871 and its accompanying regulations.<p>Capital gains by foreign persons are generally taxed by the foreign person's country of residence unless the foreign person has a tax nexus to the U.S. Generally, the tax nexus is provided by citizenship, actual residence, or deemed residence.  Id.<p>Eduardo is not an actual or deemed resident of the U.S., thus his only tax nexus was via his citizenship.  By renouncing his citizenship, he severs that last bit of tax nexus.<p>Consequently, the sale of the Facebook stock is now taxable only by the foreign jursidiction in which he is a citizen/resident.  In this case, Singapore does not impose a capital gains tax, so he would effectively not be subject to any tax at all on the sale of his Facebook stock.<p>This matters because Singapore is one of the few non-tax haven jurisdictions that provides for no capital gain taxation.  It's also unusual that he did so around the same time that Facebook began <i>publicly</i> indicating it would move toward an IPO, despite Eduardo having been eligible for Singaporean citizenship for some time before he actually renounced his U.S. citzenship.  Note also that Eduardo ""resides"" in Singapore but spends significant amounts of time outside of the country.<p><i>This is why so many people (including myself) think Eduardo renounced his citizenship to avoid paying taxes.</i>  It's the circumstances surrounding his renunciation which are suspicious.  If he'd chosen to move to Europe, or China, or Hong Kong, or some other place, it wouldn't be an issue.  But based on the totality of the circumstances, it looks like tax avoidance was his primary motive.<p>Hope this helps.",1337291976

3989338,comment,3987424,3988108,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Yeah, it's very overpriced. This is a common problem with tools like this because it's a niche market; specialty gear tends to be much, more expensive than the mass-market equivalent, to the point of limiting sales. It needs to a) be $99, at which price it will fly out the door, or b) have MIDI, because keyboard nerds are much more used to this sort of technology and likely to make up the bulk of initial sales, or c) have a much, much larger library of pre-programmed DSP modules.<p>I used to work in this field, and though I don't want to run down the excellent achievement of this project, it's an untried brand and technology in an area with multiple mature competitors.

Congrats we now know who is scrapping you with a simple google search.<p>Now comes the fun part.  Instead of supplying the same fake data to all, we need to supply unique fake data to every ip address that comes to the site.  Keep track of what ip, and what data you gave them.<p>Build your own scrapper's specifically for the sites that are stealing your content and scrape them looking for your unique fake data.<p>Once you find the unique fake data, tie it back to the ip address we stored earlier and you have your scrapper.<p>This can be all automated at this point to auto ban the crawler that keeps stealing your data.

Did Eduardo renounce his citizenship to avoid paying U.S. federal income taxes on the sale of his Facebook stock?
If the answer is yes, there is a good probability that the IRS will pursue him for taxes arising from the IPO.  (Note: in most situations, the primary intent must be to avoid taxes, but in some situations, any intent to avoid taxes is enough.)<p>Furthermore, he could be barred from this country (""excludable"") under U.S. immigration laws.<p>The Senator has indicated that he believes the answer is yes.  It's not a matter of spite; it's a mater of timing.

Never assume you know how taxes work, almost no one does.<p>I <i>invested</i> in a company, as in, <i>paid cash</i> for preferred shares. That company was later acquired, in a stock+cash deal, mostly stock. The way the tax code works, I realized the gain on the day the deal went through. assume 5x short term gain in NY or CA: That's ~50% tax on the gain, or 2x in taxes ON THE DAY OF THE DEAL. but .. there's rule 144; I didn't pay for the acquiring company's stock - I was given them in exchange for the acquired company stock. So I have to wait 6 months to sell them.<p>During these 6 months, the acquiring company tanks 60%. My 5x (for which I already paid 1x) is now worth 2x, which I already paid in taxes -- I've lost all of my gains, and my initial investment. Again: I paid 1x originally + 2x in taxes, and now hold something worth 2x in my hands, for a net of -1x, on a successful investment!<p>Here's where the magic of dates come into play: if the deal goes through in jan-june, 6 month lockup ends within the same calendar year, and you can net the profit and loss. Which happened, luckily for me. If it is in jul-dec, you can't.<p>The acquiring company was 100 times larger than the company I invested in, and I was a minority investor there. Other than making the initial investment, I had absolutely no say about any deal -- the first time I could do anything was 6 months after the deal date, at which point I had already suffered all the consequences.<p>edit: corrected the math.<p>clarification: the numbers are not factual from my case. I actually ended with a modest 0.3x post-tax profit, everything taken into account (on a 5x acquisition!).

I think the problem people are having is the impedence mismatch of treating pull based engagement to traditional push marketing.<p>Traditional advertising is about pushing people to buy a product like a car or soda. Pull based engagement is more about people seeking you out and your business interacting with them at a time and place of their choosing.<p>Facebook is a <i>social</i> network, not a shopping mall or yellow pages. Google is more of a yellow pages for most people. I bet GM would be more successful if their $10 million spend went to push local dealerships and created customer to dealer relationships via coupons or creating local car clubs for various brands/models.<p>Local businesses would be more successful on FB if they treated as a lead gen system to build up their own mailing lists to offer ongoing coupons, sales, information, etc. You know, creating a relationship with them.<p>The point is, all of this goes against traditional advertising and marketing ideas where you just had to blast out a bunch of ads to TV, Radio, Newspapers, or more recently Google.

It was data-driven and multi-dimensional.  At the same time, you're learning about the content -- global poverty through the eyes of a top UN advisor -- you're watching world-class data visualization.<p>Since their inception, TED has done a tremendous job staying on message.  Most talks are given by people who are up to their elbows in the subject matter that they're talking about.  This entrepreneur works in the business community, so there's relevance there, but that's pretty abstract. I would much rather this point be made by a union organizer.<p>The core message of the non-TED talk is a good one.  That is the problem.  The entrepreneur and the internet grassroots that have followed him are over the moon for it and are happy with the implementation that have here. If they were a bit less resistant to the criticism they've received, they could probably find a better way to get their message out.<p>For instance, how much more credible would it be if there were an enterprising union leader who could talk about his or her chapter's strategies, and who has measured the boost that their union members' employment has brought to their local community? In this age when many employers can't afford to invest in training employees who will leave their firms in 5 years, a union that provided job security to its members through training partnerships with local community colleges, and provided quality assurance to employers through licenses, and certifications in order to close the skills gap would be an inspiring organization. If they were providing each other with unemployment insurance and allowing the federal government to spend less money, that's a bi-partisan win!<p>An approach like that works at TED.  One that can't be cobbled together in a weekend. These talks are almost always personal, representing years of on-the-ground activity.  If they aren't given by <i>the</i> leader in the field they're given by someone with a unique perspective, like Jill Bolte Taylor, the stroke victim/neuroscientist who talked about the stroke she had.<p>This entrepreneur has a compelling message, one that I agree with, but his standpoint isn't special and his content hasn't progressed further than a well fleshed-out idea.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_on_poverty.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_o...</a>",1337289837

       has indeed shaped much of the economic landscape.""
</code></pre>
The first line of his talk is a bit fluffy, but I don't see anything else here that isn't objectively true. Supply-side economics and increased benefits for the rich are a major part of the Republican platform, and because this idea has been accepted as true by society at large, it is not being directly challenged by the Democrats. (Who, arguably, want just as much to protect the interests of the rich & powerful as the Republicans do.)<p><pre><code>    2. ""But sometimes the ideas that we are certain are
       true, are dead wrong. Consider that for thousands of
       years, humans believed that the Earth was the center
       of the universe. It's not, and an astronomer who
       still believed that it was, would do some pretty
       terrible astronomy. Likewise, a policymaker who
       believes that the rich are job creators and therefore 
       should not be taxed, will do equally terrible
       policy.""
</code></pre>
This is just bad rhetoric and bad logic, IMO. I get the point he's trying to make, but he's not making it well -- and this is where I begin to really understand TED's decision not to highlight his video on their front page.<p><pre><code>    3. ""I have started or helped start dozens of companies,
       and initially hired lots of people, but if there was
       no one around who could afford to buy what we had to
       sell, all those companies, and all those jobs, would
       have evaporated.""
</code></pre>
I can't agree more with this. I think this should be obvious to anybody that thinks about economics at all, and I think this is the absolutely massive achilles' heel for supply-side economics, the elephant in the room that people don't want to talk about.<p><pre><code>    4. ""That's why I can say with confidence that rich
       people don't create jobs, nor do businesses large or
       small. Jobs are a consequence of a circle-of-life-
       like feedback loop between customers and businesses.
       And only consumers can set in motion this virtuous
       cycle of increasing demand and hiring. In this sense, 
       an ordinary consumer is more of a job creator than a
       capitalist like me. That's why when business people
       take credit for creating jobs, it's a little bit like 
       squirrels taking credit for evolution. (audience
       chuckles) It's actually the other way around. Anyone
       who's ever run a business knows that hiring more
       people is a course of last resort for capitalists.
       It's what we do if and only if rising consumer demand 
       requires it. And in this sense, calling ourselves job 
       creators isn't just inaccurate, it's disingenuous.""
</code></pre>
Again, the delivery here is terrible, IMO, but I think his overall point is largely correct. But, there are exceptions. It would be hard to argue that PG, for example, isn't a ""job creator"" -- or at least a wealth creator. He, and others like him, are lowering the barriers to opportunity for many people and businesses. However, there still needs to be demand for the products and services those businesses offer -- as PG himself would tell you.<p>Would you, for example, deploy 100 times more servers than you thought you actually needed to meet demand for your SAAS or PAAS? No? Then why would somebody running a large corporation hire more people than they thought would be needed to meet consumer demand?<p><pre><code>    5. ""That's why our existing policies are so upside-down. 
       When the biggest tax exemptions, and lowest tax
       rates, benefit the richest, all in the name of job
       creation, all that happens is that the rich get
       richer. Since 1980, the share of income for the top
       1% of Americans has more than tripled while our
       effective tax rates have gone down by 50%. If it was
       true that lower taxes for the rich and more wealth
       for the wealthy led to job creation, today we would
       be drowning in jobs. (audience laughter and applause) 
       and yet unemployment and underemployment is at record 
       highs.""
</code></pre>
Again he kills an overall good point with a terrible statement -- unemployment and underemployment are high, yes, but nowhere near record highs.<p><pre><code>    6. ""Another reason that this idea is so wrong-headed is
       that there can never be enough super-rich people to
       power a great economy. Somebody like me makes
       hundreds or thousands of times as much as the median
       American, but I don't buy hundreds or thousands of
       times as much stuff. My family owns 3 cars, not 
       3,000. I buy a few pairs of pants and shirts a year
       like most American men, occasionally we go out to eat 
       with friends. I can't buy enough of anything to make
       up for the fact that millions of unemployed and
       underemployed Americans can't buy any new cars, any
       clothes, or enjoy any meals out. Nor can I make up
       for the falling consumption of the vast majority of
       middle-class families that are barely squeaking by,
       buried by spiraling costs, and trapped by stagnant or 
       declining wages.""

    7. ""Here's an incredible fact: that if the typical
       American family still retained the same share of
       income that they did in 1970, they'd earn like
       $45,000 more a year. Imagine what our economy would
       be like if that were the case.""

    8. ""Significant privileges have come to people like me,
       capitalists, for being perceived as job creators at
       the center of the economic universe, and the language 
       and metaphors we use to defend the current economic
       and social arrangements is telling. It's a small jump 
       from 'job creator' to 'The Creator'. (audience
       laughter) This language wasn't chosen by accident,
       and it's only honest to admit that when somebody like 
       me calls themselves a job creator, we're not just
       describing how the economy works, but more
       particularly we're making a claim on status and
       privileges that we deserve.""
</code></pre>
While perhaps true, I think that this part really detracts from his talk.<p><pre><code>    9. ""Speaking of special privileges, the extraordinary
       differential between the 15% tax rate that
       capitalists pay on carried interest, dividends, and
       capital gains, and the 35% top marginal rate on work
       that ordinary Americans pay, is kind of hard to
       justify without a touch of deification.""
</code></pre>
Man, this is just so bad right here. He really ruins his talk with this. Stick to the points, stick to the points, stick to the points.<p><pre><code>    10. ""We've had it backwards for the last 30 years. Rich
        people like me don't create jobs. Jobs are a
        consequence of an eco-systemic feedback loop between 
        customers and businesses. And, when the middle-class 
        thrives, businesses grow and hire, and owners
        profit. That's why taxing the rich to pay for
        investments that benefit all is such a fantastic
        deal for the middle class and the rich. So, ladies
        and gentlemen, here's an idea worth spreading: in a
        capitalist economy, the true job creators are
        middle-class consumers, and taxing the rich to make
        investments to make the middle class grow and thrive 
        is the single shrewdest thing we can do for the
        middle class, for the poor, and for the rich. Thank
        you.""
</code></pre>
I really think his conclusion here is a little bit overwrought. Again, I agree with what he's saying, but the delivery, especially the references to TED's ""ideas worth spreading"", is just unnecessary and superfluous.<p>As for TED's response, they justified their decision not to post the video with several points: that it was unnecessarily partisan, that it was unconvincing, and that it was mediocre.<p>I do not see that it was unnecessarily partisan at all. He mentions political parties exactly once, at the beginning of his talk, and I don't think he said anything there that wasn't true.<p>But, I could agree that his talk was unconvincing to anyone who steadfastly believes in supply-side economics. He didn't present facts well enough, and his talk was salted and peppered with too much opinion, hyperbole, and fluff.<p>And, I agree wholeheartedly that it was mediocre. Compared to the talks featured on TED's home page, it just doesn't have the substance, the impact, the original research, or the delivery that those talks have. It's just not good enough of a talk. He's got good points. He clearly has something to say, and I would love nothing more than to hear more discussion like this in our national politics, instead of continuing to take a cargo-cult approach towards heaping benefits on the wealthiest class. However, he's a terrible speaker, and his talk in general needs a lot of work.<p>(39 comments on this thread when I started writing this, and none actually discussing the content of the video -- tsk.)<p>(edit: formatting.)",1337289618

I think that'd make it much, much easier. Another idea would be a small edit button when you hover over a circle when switching between them?

My impression from following the ad scene is that it's as much about not being able to measure results than the ads being 'completely ineffective'. Big advertisers like GM are used to having robust analytics behind their buys, and Facebook doesn't (currently) let people tie their purchases in to the same technology (read as: tracking) ecosystem as most other display buys everywhere else on the web. Everyone not selling something on a click-and-buy-me basis is still feeling out the effectiveness. Maybe it's good, maybe it's not. But watch that 10M canceled buy become a 100M buy if the tables are turned and Facebook can figure out how to sell folks on the same advertising tracking their exposed to everywhere else.",1337288932

I want to get things done. I want to achieve things. I cannot stand the idea of being given orders. I have no respect for authority, only for competence. I want to realise my potential. The tedious and endless game of corporate politics bullshit is just a problem to be solved, as I see it. And one valid solution for it is to get out. This game just isn't worth the candle. What do you get for learning the ropes of the politics game? More politics. It's self-defeating. ""The only way to win is not to play"".<p>The corporate world also has a well earned reputation for being bland and boring. All the dishonesty and obsequiousness that comes out of needing to maintain a ""normal"" image makes it conforming like a mass of grey goo. Embrace weirdness and difference. Accept the idea that exceptional people are not normal. Then maybe it'll be less bland.<p>I haven't looked back since I quit. Life is so much more varied and interesting. I only ever do things that I think are worth doing. I work at my own pace (which is 10x faster than anything I ever observed in the corporate world). I work exclusively with brilliant people, doing something which I think is worthwhile.<p>Even if there wasn't more money in the long term, this is an infinitely preferable lifestyle.<p>What about you, yourself, who asked this question? Why do you stick around in this corporate world? If you're wondering why all these people are leaving, maybe you should go and find out for yourself. Believe me, it's worth it.",1221233011

302457,comment,302039,302060,0,0,yan,,,"I believe what the article referred to is unlinking of files.<p>The way most operating systems delete files is by removing just the inode entry for that file, and leave all data on the device to be overwritten at some later time. This way, forensics tools recover files that still reside in bits and pieces in blocks on file systems that aren't currently assigned to any file. Same technique applies to recovering these buffer images that the article talks about.<p>Same story is with deallocating memory. A process will no longer claim a certain block of memory once it's not needed, but not actually overwrite the area with zeroes. Operating systems generally take the approach to not doing anything they don't have to for the sake of efficiency.<p>There are tools however that will wipe the actual data multiple times before removing the inode (reference to that data) such that it makes it much more difficult to recover it. They do so multiple times due to magnetic traces on the actual drives that data leaves even when it's over written. RAM does not need to be overwritten multiple times, as far as I'm aware since it is a lot more transient.<p>Also, if same files remained on your hard drive for a long time (years), overwriting it many times might simply not be enough as the data literally seeps deeper and deeper into the platter and might be recoverable with a precision shaving of platter material. I heard this evidence anecdotally, so take it at face value.",1221232638

If you think that glorified data entry doesn't improve healthcare, you're optimizing for sexy but not really optimizing for impact.<p>A similarly unsexy problem is making sure people actually come to the doctor's office by telephoning them to remind them to come to the doctor's office.  (The folks who most urgently need to be at the doctor's office are least capable of successfully making that happen without outside assistance.)  This is approximately 2% a technical problem, 3% a compliance problem, and 95% a sales problem.<p>You're welcome to your own guesstimate of whether one can hit 500,000 patients served without taking VC funding.

Another interesting datapoint would be (and this is something that only PG or other YC founders can answer) to see what is the scope of the original vision (eg - change/revolutionarize industry XYZ) of the founders and where they end up (provided they stay in the same space). The original vision is of course going to change, but if a large number of founders are scaling down their original idea, that is an interesting data point. It may be possible that 3 months of iteration may not be sufficient time for certain types of startups. (Again, without any actual YC experience, I am simply speculating).",1332396890

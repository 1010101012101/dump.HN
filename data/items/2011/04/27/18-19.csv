Today I get an email, because I'm so ""awesome"", offering to hook me up with some great companies that are hiring.<p>I know this isn't news, as it first appeared here (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2259392), and I don't begrudge RescueTime getting some referral revenue from mining their data, but I'm far from ""awesome"" judging by my RescueTime data. It makes me wonder if everyone who uses RescueTime Solo is ""awesome"" and will eventually get one of these emails. It just feels a little weird. I hope it's working for them but it just feels like there was a better approach. Maybe they're working on it.<p>Am I alone? Who else is ""awesome""? Has anyone actually followed up and tried to get a job this way?",1303930792

Likely we'll ship 2.4 that is an improved version of 2.2. Then Redis 3.0 that is 2.4 + cluster and other things. Later <i>if</i> even diskstore will be good enough, we'll ship it, but it is possible that we'll mark diskstore as ""off topic"".<p>About Redis Cluster, it is no longer into a private branch. It is into unstable, and you can even play with it, check the latest antirez.com blog posts for instructions. Currently I'm designing the second layer, that is the resharding and how master-slave nodes interact. It does not need much coding, but requires to get the details right now that we have a base.<p>You'll see something about Redis Cluster soon.<p>About scripting, don't think that every blog post I do means I'll spend a lot of time on it. What will happen is that in the following weeks at some time I'll send something like one or two mornings of work to get an alpha version with scripting and put it into a topic branch, post a message on the mailing list and a blog post. Everything else will wait for the later times.<p>I've the attitude of talking a lot, at the point the development of Redis is almost completely a public process.\nI also change ideas often, that I think is a good idea, as to go forward without reconsidering what you are doing is not good. But this does not means that the development of Redis is a complex path that goes forward and backward, we actually are trying since Redis 2.2 to provide continuously updates not about features but about the quality of the implementation.<p>A more precise view of the actual development path can be seen looking at the 2.4 and unstable branches commit log messages.",1303929439

They are also training you to be an academic. Teaching undergrads the fundamentals of your field is very useful towards that end. Graduate school is not something to be undertaken on a whim--it is a huge commitment in time and resources. Ultimately, graduate school is not something to pursue if you're trying to make more cash.<p>I left a lucrative and successful career in IT  5 years ago to pursue my PhD because I wanted to research and teach in academia. I have met many other students who left lucrative positions to come back to school. Universally all these students understand that this career choice is not about the money, it is about lifestyle. The academic tenure-track job market is fiercely competitive and can be brutal. The tenure process is tough for young faculty members. Ultimately, a doctorate is for those who are passionate about pursuing high-quality, highly technical or theoretical research (either in academia, the government, or private industry) or for those who have a passion to teach at the university level.<p>I'm fortunate to have secured a tenure-track position at a research institution starting this autumn. The salary I'll be making will be considerably less than what I would have been making, not to mention the 5 years of not making a decent salary. The ability to continue pursuing my research agenda, collaborate with incredibly bright colleagues of my choosing, work more flexible hours than in my previous jobs, create and develop courses for undergrad and grad students which may have an enormous impact in their careers, and spend more time with my wife and kids makes me very happy with the ""value"" I'll be getting out of the time and effort it took to pursue a PhD.",1303928754

Memory is so unbelievably cheap, so device manufacturers all up and down the ISO stack are putting too much memory in their transceiver buffers.<p>Why is this bad? Because it screws with TCP window adjustments.  Remember that your OS will send packets until it starts to see drops, then back off of the transmit rate. You can adjust the parameters (startup rate, backoff rate), but that's the basic principle. However, when there is an overly large buffer somewhere in the middle of the network, this delays drops. This has the effect of making it nearly impossible for your TCP stack to determine the true bandwidth.<p>For some reason, most mobile device manufacturers are the worst offenders when it comes to bufferbloat.<p>Anyways, this was a brief summary.

They organize developer conferences and bring in really good people to lecture.  They hire really solid distributed systems people like Pat Helland and give them reign to work with engineering teams to improve their designs.<p>On the other hand, when you're in the trenches of a product team at Amazon, good engineering takes a back seat to features, deadlines, and keeping everything running.  There was an incredible amount of pressure from the top to maintain high levels of service, but not a lot of support for taking the time to refactor or rework those systems to address the underlying causes of service disruption.  Everything was always an emergency, but we always had to make the shallow fixes.<p>Overall, I'm much happier at Google where there is a lot of support for good engineering at all levels of the organization, not just as a means to an end, but as an end in itself.",1303927696

This is the same reason why machinists don't wear long sleeved shirts. I haven't heard of any glove type being exempt from this rule. Hair and beards are definitely discouraged as well. When I was in the air force wedding bands were discouraged during ground battle exercises given the ease of getting caught on something and losing a finger.<p>I think this is a good example of why the safety guidelines are strict and mostly require rote learning. Gloves protect against heat, but everything you have been plasma cutting or welding needs to be handled with tongs because even if the metal doesn't glow it's probably still pretty hot.

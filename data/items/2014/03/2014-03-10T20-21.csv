7375651,comment,7372574,7375167,2,0,nostrademons,,,"I don&#x27;t think open allocation works either once you get past Dunbar&#x27;s Number.  Instead of making politics go away, it makes it worse.  All the political considerations that are out in the open when you&#x27;re managing a formal org structure become hidden in the backroom deals of who wants to work with who else and how they want to go about doing it.<p>Here&#x27;s another observation for you: there is a system where there is no org chart and nobody telling anybody else what to work on.  That system is the startup ecosystem.  And the end result of that system is what you term &quot;VC-istan&quot;: some players become more powerful than others, and they freely choose who they want to associate with based on reputation, or how well their personalities mesh, or pattern-matching on previous successes, or who they went to college with.<p>The only &quot;solution&quot; I could come up with is that <i>there is no solution</i>.  If you give people agency and freedom of association, you will eventually run into situations where their freedom to act impinges on someone else&#x27;s freedom to act, and it is impossible to let both of them work on what they wish without forcing one or the other to make tradeoffs.  Or, alternatively, they could both choose to work alone, in which case it is impossible to build anything larger than what one person can do by himself.  Once you see that tradeoff, it&#x27;s possible to make choices that stake out various parts of that space, eg. another thread currently on HN [1] describes how your options are management, niche development, or consulting as you get older.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7373301"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7373301</a>",1394485099
7375650,comment,7372574,7375538,2,0,shas3,,,"> In a non-protectionist world there would be free movement of labor and so there would be nothing stopping say a US or European developer moving overseas to follow the work if that it what they desired. Sadly this is not the case so off-shoring is equally as protectionist which is where a lot of the criticism comes from.<p>Would like to disagree. An American passport allows you to work from, pretty much most other OECD countries in the world. So, if Singapore has a better job market for techies than the US, nothing prevents one from relocating. But in my experience, American citizens are, on average, more reluctant to relocate even between US states, than immigrants. Indians or Chinese leave their families and relocate 10000 miles to live and work in the US. But most Americans I&#x27;ve met aren&#x27;t as eager to relocate to say, Singapore (or even jump from one coast to the other or to the mid-west), even if prospects for jobs are better.",1394485094

It&#x27;s by far the best place I&#x27;ve worked, just in terms of general autonomy and not worrying about stupid stuff. We&#x27;ve also released a number of hit games, which helps people to stay relaxed, I&#x27;m sure.<p>I&#x27;m the eldest of 5 developers, but I think the youngest is 29-30. We&#x27;re essentially all generalists, although we have individual specialties. A couple of guys have really deep knowledge of iOS strangeness or shaders. I&#x27;ve got some specialization in game AI and physics, as well as game design skills. Any task can go to any dev and come back with reasonable results. There&#x27;s no hand-holding.<p>We&#x27;re an iOS shop, so my day-to-day coding is in Objective-C, although I do a lot of tools programming in Python 2.x.<p>Generally, I get to do what I want, with some exceptions. There&#x27;s  a strong culture of just doing something that helps the company, without necessarily being tasked to do it. Taking a day off to do a research project is also tolerated when we&#x27;re not on a really tight deadline.<p>Unlimited vacation and sick-days, within reason.<p>I don&#x27;t see working for anyone else in the future -- I&#x27;d have to start my own gig.<p>There&#x27;s some temptation to work for a Google, but at this point in my career it&#x27;s getting a bit undignified to work for other people as an employee.

Any other similar pattern would also work:<p><pre><code>  right + down + right + up\n  up + right + up + left\n  left + down + left + up\n</code></pre>\nI will also sometimes break the pattern to consolidate some of the larger numbers when opportunities present themselves. But other than that, I usually stick to the pattern.<p>Of course, it will only get you so far, because you will eventually run out of space to keep the pattern working. But it will get you past the first few thousand points (512 or higher).",1394484586

If your users belong to different clusters and similar clusters don&#x27;t meet, there is little value and the network doesn&#x27;t become more valuable for anyone. By focusing on the same corner scenario you help similar clusters find each-other consistently and thus amplify value to each-other. I took over one corner and keep stacking on to it with blocks of increasing value, essentially never moving out of it. If you move out of your corder, a different cluster takes hold in it and then everyone in that corner will hesitate to buy into you, even if the other cluster is small - it becomes a thorn in your butt.

(Advice not totally unsolicited -- I&#x27;ve been homebrewing for about 17 years.)<p>- Brewing a good batch of beer - better than most of the what&#x27;s sold in stores - is easy. Almost anyone can do it with their first batch.<p>- This tricks people into thinking that brewing is easy. But...<p>- Consistency is hard. That recipe that turned out so well the first time? It might be good the second time, or it might spoil, or it might be too hoppy, or it might be cloudy, or taste of yeast, and so on. At any rate, it&#x27;s unlikely that it will taste exactly the same as it did the first time.<p>- Brewing large batches is hard. Even transitioning from 5 gallon to 10 gallon batches requires different equipment. Recipes don&#x27;t scale in a simple way. And when you get into backwatering high gravity beers everything becomes even more complex.<p>- Making wine and cider is hard compared to brewing beer. The former two have fewer ingredients, which, being fruit instead of grain, tend to be less consistent. Conditioning takes MUCH longer which means feedback and learning take much longer.<p>- And yet, I bet actually making a consistent, high-quality beverage is the easy part compared to running a profitable brewing business.<p>- Brewing is expensive. Startup costs are high. Even an enthusiastic homebrewer can easily spend thousands. Think $10,000 for a bare-minimum commercial brewing setup built around e.g. a SABCO Brew Magic.<p>- The legal stuff is hard. Licenses, bonds, a legal location -- all that stuff takes time and money.<p>- The food industry is brutal. Combining a brewery and a restaurant seems like it must tremendously increase the probability of failure.<p>Anyway, brewing is a fun hobby. But one of those that sort of lulls people into making hasty business decisions.",1394483886

7375498,comment,7369999,7375230,2,0,hamburglar,,,"PHP&#x27;s public image problem is mostly due to the direction from which you can approach it.  You can be the maintainer of a static HTML page who knows nothing at all about programming, and someone can help you dip your toe into PHP by showing you some simple tricks, and suddenly you have the ability to start adding code here and there, copy/paste style, to your content.  The results are predictable.  And for better or for worse, the language has been given some ill-advised features in order to cater to this type of user.<p>And you can approach it in the opposite direction, as well: as a programmer who knows what he&#x27;s doing, you need to choose a language and a platform to run your app on, and PHP is ubiquitous and perfectly capable, and you know which ill-advised language features to avoid, so it&#x27;s a reasonable choice.<p>The difference between PHP and most other languages for building web sites is that with most other languages, you simply can&#x27;t follow the first path.  Web servers that let you just drop snippets of ruby into HTML are not everywhere (I assume that exists in some ill-advised apache module, but I haven&#x27;t personally seen it).  You need to know a significant amount up front to get your code running, so the &quot;never even considered programming before&quot; portion of the population is naturally suppressed.  It doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t exist or that somehow making a language more difficult to use automatically makes its users better, it just means that a certain type of amateur user is naturally suppressed, so there is proportionally fewer of them.<p>Note the similarities:  ActionScript/Flash is actually a pretty cool piece of technology [let&#x27;s ignore their poor track record with regard to security holes in the runtime, since that&#x27;s an orthogonal issue].  And yet it&#x27;s terrible to program in for a seasoned developer because the community is so chock full of artists and amateurs who just dipped their toe in to add some minimal interactivity to their drawings that you often have a hard time finding docs that are written above the copy/paster level.  And well-written ActionScript code is a relative rarity as a result.  I&#x27;m sure that on at least some level, any seasoned dev who primarily uses PHP can relate.",1394483394

The issue is that there wasn&#x27;t just one quark! There&#x27;s a whole intense thermal mass of quarks and other particles, and the energies are high enough (and times short enough) that more of them are being pulled from the vacuum and annihilating back into it all the time (this is largely a field-theory statement, I&#x27;m afraid). <i>That</i> mass of quarks is what&#x27;s being pulled apart by inflation.

It generalizes a pretty wide range of concepts, which makes it hard to talk about accurately without resorting to jargon.<p>Iterators and generators are solutions to the same sort of problem but aren&#x27;t quite as general. They do a good job of abstracting over streams and data structures, but I don&#x27;t think they are as useful for dealing with single pieces of data with something special about them such as computations that could fail. It would be interesting to hack __iter__ to cover that case, but it&#x27;s not idiomatic python. I think the &quot;special types of data&quot; idea works better in a statically-typed language so it would be non-pythonic on a couple of levels.<p>I use generators extensively in my python code, but I find they tend to infect programs. Once generators are used in one place, everything that interacts with that code works better as a generator. In Haskell, it is easier to use lifting for part of an expression without affecting the style of the rest of the program.<p>In addition, Haskell&#x27;s type system and type inference make it possible to use these techniques in ways that would be very strange and difficult to do in Python which I didn&#x27;t get in to in my original post because I wanted to stay in somewhat familiar territory.  For example, functions are Functors and there are some interesting patterns that can be abstracted over by taking advantage of that. That said, if you thought of lifting like this as a strongly-typed slightly more general __iter__, you could be quite productive with it in Haskell. This is also useful for other languages because it makes it clear how much more general the __iter__ interface is and how it can be applied to things that are not data structures or streams.",1394482962

This was usually solved by &quot;zoning&quot; and local coordinate systems, hence it was easier to deal with a smaller set of ground &quot;tiles&quot; and haze out the distant ones. Having said all that, nowadays you can use vertex shaders to simulate 64-bit (or rather 56-bit) precision and get around 1cm resolution at any distance<p>- the need to have various LODs that include curvature of the Earth with significantly increased error tolerances, which in turn increases memory consumption.

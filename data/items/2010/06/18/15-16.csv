Even though outbound links are nofollowed, the search engines still follow them and count them as links into a site (they just don't pass pagerank).  So the theory is that if I post a spam link on Hacker News, if it stays up for an hour before being flagged, that should be enough time for search bots to crawl their way back to my site.",1276876738

If people (and therefore groups of them as corporations) were left free to innovate and produce, there wouldn't be any practical problem regarding antibiotic resistance that you would likely have become aware of in the first place.<p>More fundamentally, capitalism needs more than just an economic defense (plenty of people and organizations do that today, and while their arguments are essentially true, they are not going to win that way). Capitalism is the only moral social system because it is by definition the only one that is compatible with individual rights. Individual rights are required because only reason allows mankind to maintain the conditions required for his survival. Any other system or ""tweak"" necessarily requires the <i>initiation</i> or threat of non-retalliatory force upon innocent men, which necessarily stops their minds in a manner proportional to the degree and scope of the threat.<p>The next step is pretty simple - what is the good? The altruistic idea of the good is not logically sound; if the good is defined as helping others, how is the good defined for the recipients of that help? To tack on another rule to solve the conundrum isn't sensible - to morally bifurcate humanity a priori (in this case, without looking at the specific actions of a particular person that arise from free will) should give you pause. Rand's answer is that every human being exists for their own sake, and that the good is what is in their own long-term rational self-interest. This is a precondition for proper and healthy human relationships; to the extent that people pursue this, they improve their lot and lives.<p>So to reiterate: from a scientific perspective, this is not a practical problem that doctors would face under true captialism, and morally speaking (which, in Rand's view, is exactly equivalent to the practical), there is nothing that can exist that is better than capitalism.",1276876662

In reality, there's a balance to be made between the cost of maintaining the status quo (in the event that the status quo sucks) and the cost of making changes.<p>One thing that really frustrated me when I started my career is that the cost of making changes turns out to be non-trivial.

1442580,comment,1442016,1442016,0,0,andrewbadera,,,"I am currently 31, living in upstate NY.<p>I started college fulltime at 18. I started in physics, switched to IT. This was 1997.<p>I was working in the field for the likes of IBM and Xerox by the time I was 19. School quickly became deprioritized. This was 1999.<p>9/11 hits. This is the same year, or year before, I would have graduated on-schedule. A month later, I get laid off of an extended contract I'd been working for a year. For the better part of the next eight months, I can't get an interview aside from one job in Montana. MONTANA! I scrape by on freelance work. I land a job paying 50% of my last salary. After six months I switch over to a job paying 70% of my last salary -- still very disappointing, but livable, barely.<p>End of 2005, I quit that job and go back to Xerox for a second contract. Almost returned to my pre-9/11 salary. I happen to wrap up my associate's (AAS) degree in IT at this time. Six months later, I relocated to be closer to family. That job, in 2006, finally put me substantially over my pre-9/11 salary, at about 80th-85th percentile for my role nationally, and about 95th percentile for my role locally.<p>My independent consulting work starts growing significantly around this time.<p>In late 2008, I finally crossed the six figure mark in fulltime salary. I also made a healthy five figures in indie consulting in 2008 and 2009.<p>It would have helped me, I think, to have a degree PLUS my experience after 9/11. I don't think a degree alone would have done much for me -- all my four-and-out classmates were out of work and/or getting paid less than I was myself.<p>Does my AAS help me now? Doubtful.<p>Would a bachelor's help? Not salary-wise ... but it would be a nice step on the way to that Master of Science or MBA that I've always wanted ...",1276876497

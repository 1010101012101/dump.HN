Kids should understand multiple algorithms for addition/subtraction/multiplication/division for the same reason that we teach CS undergrads multiple sorting algorithms.<p>The point isn&#x27;t to be able to pound out a sorting algorithm on the spot, but that learning about sorting algorithms provides a good &quot;prototype&quot; of thinking about algorithms more generally. Ditto for mathematical operators.<p>The problem is that parents never really had a deep understanding of even basic arithmetic.

8027229,comment,8026420,8026420,7,0,MyDogHasFleas,,,"The real question is, what is the interface you are virtualizing, and how do the characteristics of that interface  influence the design of the OS you are building?<p>Hypervisors virtualize the hardware interface: the user-mode and privileged-mode instruction sets, the I/O ports and channels, the memory model. This is good because that interface is stable and well-understood, allows for a high degree of isolation between processes, and has a large number of applications (operating systems) already written to the interface ready to run on the hypervisor. This is bad because the interface is more low-level than one would like as an API for programmers, requiring another layer (the OS or at least kernel) to make it usable.<p>Microkernels, or kernels in general, provide a system-call interface that is made up by the OS designer. This is good and bad in a mirror image sort of way vs. the hypervisor. It is good because the interface is more suited to programmers, providing OS level services rather than presenting as bare metal. It is bad because the interface is less stable (evolving in software time rather than hardware time), less provably or practically isolating between processes, and has a smaller ecosystem of applications already written to that interface (perhaps zero if it&#x27;s brand new).<p>It is useful to view kernels, microkernels, and hypervisors as points on a spectrum of virtualized interfaces. One can see hypervisors moving towards kernels with virtual additions to the hardware interface, such as paravirtualized I/O devices, special trap instructions to communicate with the hypervisor, and optimizations such as page sharing, snapshotting, and live motion.<p>Microkernels can also be viewed as moving to a smaller, cleaner system call interface on the spectrum, with greater stability and isolation between processes than a &quot;big&quot; kernel. But the issue of lack of applications written to the interface remains.<p>The ascent of Linux containers hits a sweet spot on this spectrum IMO. Linux containers virtualize the Linux system call interface, which has become relatively stable, certainly has a large body of applications written to it, and provides a &quot;good enough&quot; degree of isolation among its containers (which keeps improving).<p>IMO the ascent of Linux containers is on a hockey stick curve right now (due to Docker having simplified and standardized its interface and container format/management) and will overrun any debate like this between hypervisors and microkernels, for those of us not doing academic OS research. Virtual machines will not go away, but will be used more for their original purpose, to allow running completely different OSes on the same hardware, and to provide completely isolated OS instances, rather than as general purpose compute capabilities a la IaaS.",1405255508

8027224,comment,8026690,8026969,1,0,emn13,,,"The amount of liquid in a coffee cup is, however, limited.  Furthermore, steam is a <i>lot</i> more dangerous due to the heat freed in condensation.  Furthermore, there&#x27;s a pretty large difference between 134 °C and 90.  Finally, I don&#x27;t think the mechanics of destroying infectious agents is really a great analogy for the mechanics of skin burns: the speed of reactions indeed increases non-linearly, yet the energy increases linearly.  The energy in a coffee cup isn&#x27;t nearly enough to damage the entire body; therefore the amount of damage is likely linked to the amount of energy released.  Not that I&#x27;m volunteering for an experiment, admittedly.<p>You mention the amount of time needed for serious burns to occur, yet that amount of time is huge compared to the time needed for water (or coffee) will flow away off or for people will to react.  For her to remain exposed to the full load of coffee for around 12-15 seconds requires a pretty odd set of circumstances. For those burns to be large enough to be life-threatening normally requires a large surface area to be burnt, and that requires a large amount of coffee for a long time.  (The 12-15 number is from wikipedia which says her lawyers produced evidence that this is the duration t 82 degrees celsius that &quot;may produce third-degree burns&quot;).<p>Of course, there&#x27;s the complicating factor here that she was quite old; at 79 she would not have been as resilient as younger person.  And while that&#x27;s a terrible shame, it&#x27;s unreasonable to blame macdonalds for aging.  Reading, she weighed just 47kg before her injury, which is low.  I don&#x27;t believe that a healthy person would have sustained her injuries.<p>It sounds implausible that she could have managed to sustain those kind of injuries given the circumstances - unless some other factors played a role (such as frailty due to aging). It&#x27;s terrible she suffered as she did, but I still don&#x27;t see how that could have been reasonably foreseen by macdonalds (and therefore the verdict seems unreasonable).<p>The point of the lawsuit isn&#x27;t (just) about what happened to her, but critically also about the degree to which MacDonalds&#x27; was taking unreasonable risks.  And as wikipedia points out, there have been many, many similar lawsuits, that apparently were not successful.  (And note that coffee is still served at that temperature).",1405255395

From one student, you get back a 400 line monstrosity that somehow, miraculously, does the right thing. Do you shrug it off and say &quot;as long as it works&quot;, or do you grow very concerned that the student is somehow missing the forest for the trees, even though they arrived at an apparently correct answer?<p>In my experience teaching, it&#x27;s far more likely that the student doesn&#x27;t understand some basic, necessary underlying concepts than that the student is very bright and was trying to come up with a super optimized sorting algorithm.

Because they don&#x27;t know the difference between a specification and an implementation, teaching multiple implementations seems silly.

My surprise about the reaction to that case was that I assumed that the vast majority of the US had had a cup of coffee from McDonald&#x27;s. I&#x27;d been burned by their coffee before; it was just one of the many risks of my morning commute.<p>I just think that we rationalized the risks to our safety because a company as large as McDonald&#x27;s must have done a lot of studies on their coffee and figured out a temperature that was the perfect compromise between preventing disease and putting meltdown hot liquids in the hands of people driving cars. I thought that their goal in making the coffee that hot was to lower their net liability (and hence, the public&#x27;s net danger) rather than what it really was - a way to serve coffee that got very old.<p>It was a business decision that had a money value for the company. They undertook it in order to make money. Paying for the externalities in court is a good place for McDonald&#x27;s to learn how to recalibrate how much injury is worth, and see if their price calculation for raising the temperature of their coffee still makes sense.<p>At the time, the reactionary corporate rhetoric parodied the position of consumer advocates as requiring businesses to cover coffee cups with long elaborate disclaimers about how coffee could possibly be hot.

Every time a farmer applies anything to a field, he will have to put on safety gear, measure out an amount, mix it with water, load it into the sprayer, drive the tractor around, and then clean up afterwards.  When you are working with enough of a chemical to kill a hundred people, every single one of these steps carries the risk of an acute exposure.  Dead is dead, regardless of how it happens.  Don&#x27;t dismiss it.<p>edit: From source [1]:<p>> Chronic toxicity: Vineyard sprayers experienced liver disease after 3 to 15 years of exposure to copper sulfate solution in Bordeaux mixture [8].

Whether it reduces down to &quot;hooks&quot; or reduces even further down to assembly language &quot;mov, add, jmp&quot; instructions is not that interesting to me.<p>We have text editors that are 1-dimensional and linear.  The programming code is not in &quot;layers&quot; like layers in Photoshop or AutoCAD drawings, and yet we&#x27;re trying overlay N-dimensions of concerns throughout the code.  We have some crude attempts such as text editors outlining collapse/expand of code regions (code folding).  We have syntax coloring of programming language keywords but not of the higher-level concerns.  Can the tools make this better?!  Maybe.  We (the computer scientists and programmers out in the real world) are trying to figure out how to interweave all this in a sane way.   A focus on this issue of coding all the N-dimensional cross-cutting concerns will naturally lead to a umbrella concept that&#x27;s researched in isolation.[1]<p>I don&#x27;t believe in AOP as the The Next Big Thing.

But whereas TeX is now frozen (Knuth no longer has either the time or the inclination to extend it), NTS is intended to remain flexible and extensible. Indeed, its very raison d&#x27;être is to provide a portable platform on which experiments and extensions can be easily layered.&quot;</i><p>And how could anyone find fault in their reasoning? It <i>felt</i> right after all: in the dawn of the 21st century, with modern programming paradigms and all that computing power, why get stuck with Pascal and outdated space concerns? And so they did [2]:<p><i>&quot;NTS is written in Java; the group debated for some time which language was the ideal language for a complete re-implementation, and although the original desiderata stressed that it should be a modern, rapid-prototyping language, further introspection suggested that a modern, object-oriented, truly portable language was even more important. On that basis, Sun&#x27;s Java was chosen, and experience during the first year has suggested that that decision was justified. Even though Java lacks something in terms of type declarations and static polymorphism, its genuinely portable nature (&quot;compile once, run anywhere&quot; is Sun&#x27;s justifiable claim for this language), combined with its network-awareness and widespread availability, make it an ideal language for the task.&quot;</i><p>Suffice to say their efforts didn&#x27;t pan out as they hoped. It turns out, efficiency <i>is a thing</i> --even with modern hardware [5,6]-- and, as it happens, high extensibility/modularity <i>and</i> efficiency are very, very hard to achieve in the general case.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8026671"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8026671</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nts.tug.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nts.tug.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Typesetting_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Typesetting_System</a><p>[4] Or their immediate successors, the ExTeX project - <a href=""http://www.extex.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extex.org/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand</a>",1405253107

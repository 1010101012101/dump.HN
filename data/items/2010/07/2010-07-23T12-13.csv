b) Linux distros have package managers which make the task of setting up development libraries a breeze. On windows youre still stuck installing each library by hand. 
c) If what youre doing is very well defined and all the technical pieces have windows installers then theres not much of an advantage moving to linux.
d) If youre using the windows .net stack then again youre probably better off sticking with windows.",1279889924

So you could, for example, on a website order a barcode that encodes ""This ticket valid between 10:00-18:00, on route section X, and belongs to Mr. John Doe"". Obviously someone could copy and re-use that very barcode but you have the same problem with RFID tokens, unless there's some sort of centralized validation going on. Which is, btw, actually much easier to implement than you make it out to be, considering you'll have a hard time finding a train-station without GSM coverage nowadays.<p>I do agree with your concerns that not <i>everyone</i> has a phone capable of displaying these codes, yet, but it's a matter of years until that will be the case. During then you'll need the old paper tickets as a fallback - but that's the case with any new technology, it's not like you could flip the switch with RFID over night either.<p>Likewise Bluetooth may indeed be the wrong tool for the job, personally I'd favor the barcodes that seem to work out well enough on airports.<p>And finally, the development effort for making the software work all phone platforms is negligible. Again, the Airlines have demonstrated it can be done, and when you compare it to the effort required to rollout an RFID solution including the hardware then I'd bet the barcode approach is actually easier to do.<p>So. This, for once, <i>is</i> a problem that would be fairly straightforward to solve with technology. I can't help but assume this massive gravity towards more expensive and inferior solutions is mostly a result of lobbying. Obviously there's much more money to be made by handing out physical tokens and then enjoying the benefits of a ridiculously expensive support contract as you pile bandaid over bandaid...",1279889078

Even though the Japanese spend a fortune on English education, both in the public and private sector, very few people can actually communicate.<p>This is because nearly all of the language education focuses on rote memorization, and oftentimes students who go 'outside the box' and learn to speak properly are punished.<p>My fiancee, a Japanese national, was bullied in high school for her 'weird' English... because she was the only student in the entire school who took advantage of the American teacher provided through the JET program.<p>Friendships are the second problem.  Japan is a country where your friends are dictated by and large through group affiliation, although that's slowly changing.

1540961,comment,1539783,1540860,0,0,mseebach,,,"> I wonder why people rolling out such systems never seem to see the obvious(?) writing on the wall:<p>The writing isn't at all obvious, otherwise they wouldn't have come up with it. I guess they've come to the conclusion that forging Oyster cash is similar to forging paper ticket or real cash. I don't know exactly how the Oyster card is implemented, but if it has some level of transaction log trail (however asynchronous), it's possible to detect forgeries (if you've only ever deposited Â£20, but since spend Â£100, you're cheating).<p>> Moreover I don't understand why they don't simply leverage the device that everyone already has in their pocket - the cellphone.<p>Scanning a barcode on a cellphone screen has three problems:<p>1: There are still loads and loads of cellphones not reliably capable of displaying a scannable barcode.<p>2: Barcodes are 100% copyable and include 0 cryptography - they have the same security as a barcode printed on a piece of paper, which, incidentally, is what they replace in airports.<p>3: A barcodes is read-only and requires online access to verify and record the transaction which is not feasible on the scale required for TfL.<p>Bluetooth has similar problems:<p>1: While most phones might be BT equipped, developing and supporting software for enough different phonemodels is <i>very</i> complex.<p>2: BT is designed for communication between specific devices, not a ""class"" of trusted devices. You can't trust all TfL checkpoints under one, so you'd have to navigate some sort of interaction every time you check in and out of a station/bus. Also, this interaction is different for each phone type = support hell.<p>3: BT is long range, compared to an RFID card. Sure, an RFID card might be skimmed from a difference, but it's easy for a reader to tell the card directly on the reader from every other card in the room. No so much for BT.<p>The solution including cellphones we need is NFC, which is basically RFID that can leverage the processing power of the cellphone. It just doesn't exist on very many phones yet.",1279887714

I thought you were smarter than that.<p>While I'll certainly admit that anti-trust rules have some gray areas where we could argue the relative utility of actions against monopolies or near-monopolies, this is not one of them.  I doubt if even the most die-hard laissez faire types would argue against going after Intel here - if cheating like this is not forcefully dealt with the whole idea of a free market eats itself by its own asshole.<p>Did they seriously think they'd get away with this, or did they just figure the ultimate cost (cash spent + whatever penalties they are subject to once caught) would be worth it?",1279887439

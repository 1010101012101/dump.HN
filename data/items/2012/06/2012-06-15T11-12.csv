Without solving the overall page layout issue, this is a nice drawing tool like others have mentioned, and kudos to the technical and design effort, but in the end if you're not using the DOM, you're making pictures of web sites...<p>Therefore, it's my responsibility to let you all know about Edit Room, my project as an independent developer, <a href=""http://www.edit-room.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edit-room.com/</a><p>Edit Room is also a 'web design in the browser' app, but it uses the real DOM, not a canvas, so whatever you can build with Edit Room is what is truly able to be built with HTML and CSS. It's only a slight limitation due to the unique way I've handled absolute/relative layouts. Edit Room still gives you incredible design and layout freedom, without floats.<p>Edit Room doesn't do fixed widths at all.  Documents created with Edit Room flex naturally. Everything you layout and design with my app is based on a flexible grid, and it has a built-in width preview, so you can design at any screen width.<p>Edit Room exports the full HTML and CSS for your entire layout, or you can copy individual elements' CSS, it's adaptable to your workflow.<p>Edit Room also supports linking Typekit and Fontdeck accounts, so you can use Web Fonts in your exported designs.<p>You can try out the demo here: <a href=""http://www.edit-room.com/screens/13/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edit-room.com/screens/13/edit</a><p>Oh, and one more thing: You can animate your layers with visual keyframes and Edit Room generates CSS3 Animations.",1339760256

4115900,comment,4108400,4109521,1,0,Joeri,,,"Twitter is a web site, not a web app. First-page load performance is critical for them. I wouldn't have chosen a client-side rendering architecture.<p>My perspective is that of web apps. By using client-side rendering I can prefetch more data than the user needs at almost no extra cost, and render it when they click without hitting the server. Not having to contact the server at all beats any server-side rendering architecture. Even web apps that supposedly do server-side rendering will end up with some prefetching for performance (e.g. tooltips and detail panes are already embedded in the page but hidden).<p>The reality is that the big bottleneck in any web app is not the fetching of data but the fetching of the front-end. The more front-end code (images, js, css) that you can fetch from browser cache or CDN the faster your app. The ""ideal"" case is not having to fetch anything except the data from the server. You can do that today with client-side rendering combined with far-future expiration or HTML5 appcache. The caveat here is that the performance benefits only start compounding for client-side rendering if you can prefetch data. Twitter couldn't do that, so there was no benefit.<p>Like any complex technical issue, there is no right answer in general, only a right answer in context. People should just be careful about what they're measuring. The important benchmark is time to load the page, not time to process the page on the server (a huge difference), and measurements should be globally distributed (you should be measuring transcontinental page visits).",1339758085

Also, more marriages have probably failed due to the husband being a wimpy ""I love you every day no matter what""-kind of guy than due to adultery. Adultery is the consequence of a failing marriage, not the cause.

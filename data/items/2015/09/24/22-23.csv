These are what defines what the inventor claims to have a right to exclude others from doing.<p>If a patent claim covers X, Y, or Z and it turns out that yes, X was known in the art, then yes, the patent will be invalid.<p>In plain English: Suppose someone claims to have invented doing a thing once, twice, or three times. That patent would give them the right to exclude anyone from doing that thing once, twice, or three times. But if people have been doing that thing once for years, the patent owner is attempting to exclude people from doing things that people already do. That&#x27;s invalid. The court will not rewrite the claim to save it to being only 2 or 3 times--there may be other ways to do it, but the court is not that way.",1443135586

He worked in a different department. He had no authority over me. There were plenty of people at the company who were married to each other. There was absolutely nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with him asking me for a date. But he was also the only individual I met in over 5 years at the company who knew what GIS was before I explained it. I have a certificate in GIS. I wanted to get into the IT department. It was clear to me that a senior programmer asking me for a date was not <i>bad behavior</i> per se on his part, but it nonetheless was not only not going to open doors for me, it was going to help close them. His interest in dating me was going to make it harder, not easier, to try to get an IT job. I never did get an IT job. I ultimately left the company. (Edit: IT jobs paid about 2-4 times what I was making. Had I gotten an IT job, I likely would have stayed at the company.)<p>Another man, also high ranking and also with no actual power me, kept looking for excuses to touch me in a &quot;punch you in the shoulder&quot; sort of expression of affection. It was clear to me it was an expression of sexual interest. He was a married man. I left the company not long after this began. Because I did not work directly with him and only knew him socially as someone I talked with in the cafeteria, I saw no reason to report it. Had it continued or escalated or had circumstances changed such that I did need to actually work with him, I was clear this was something I might eventually have to raise as a concern.<p>Women almost never initiate touching with men. It is well established this is a sex based &quot;male privilege.&quot; Men tend to take it for granted that no woman is allowed to touch them without permission. I am clear that a man touching me without permission -- a married man, doing nothing to in any way benefit me and intentionally avoiding being helpful so as to not be seen as being sweet on me -- was violating my boundaries.<p>Another man -- well, it is a long story. I knew him socially through chit chat in the cafeteria. Purely by chance, he called me &quot;doll&quot; and &quot;babe&quot; the week before I learned he was slated to become my new boss. At the time, he did not know my name and I did not know he was married. The first incident occurred away from work and I was clear he called me &quot;doll&quot; in part because he did not know my name. It wasn&#x27;t really offensive or bad behavior, but I discussed the matter with my current boss and got myself quietly moved to another team. I then walked on egg shells around him for 24 months until he was finally fired. One rumor was that he had been fired for sexual harassment. Another was that he had been fired for an illicit affair with a lower ranking employee. I made sure to side step trouble with him. I did so successfully, so there was no smoking gun. His actions were nothing to report to HR but I was clear I did not want him in charge of me. After he was fired, a former team mate who did stay on the team -- a very attractive woman -- confided in me that he piled work on her, made inappropriate remarks and gave her so-so reviews, probably as punishment for not be interested in his attentions. She had asked me earlier why I got moved and I had not divulged the real reason. I felt bad when I learned what he had been doing to her, none of which was blatant enough for her to go to HR. Like me, she was relieved when he was fired.<p>Those are the most obvious things I can think of off the top of my head and I have a deadline to meet today, so that shall have to do for now.",1443132516

The contract would require the user to, when viewing the website, to not use ad-blocking software on the website. To proceed to the pages in question, the user would have to submit in a form the entire contents of the contract. The website would check that the contract the user sent matched the one they were provided, and provide the user with a cookie (unique to the user), to present to the webpage in the future, in order to see the actual pages. This way, only users who had agreed to not block the ads would be shown the webpages.<p>I don&#x27;t think the sending the contract would necessarily be legally considered to be any more binding than checking an &quot;I agree&quot; box, but I think it would make it less ambiguous to me whether to consider the person to have agreed. They sent a message which contained the message, and stating that they agreed to it, after seeing the entire message, and (presumably) understanding that they would send a message saying that they agreed to it if they pressed the button that they pressed to send it.

The people who run free software have saved far more money through Microsoft-driven economies of scale than they would ever have paid for Windows.<p>Third, Microsoft is a major contributor to open source, including the Linux kernel, and it has a large number of projects on both Github and Codeplex. Sure, it&#x27;s self-interested, but it&#x27;s no more self-interested than IBM, Google, Red Hat, and dozens of other companies that make money from software.<p>Why do you think Microsoft is the enemy?

The new regs don&#x27;t rule out new SoC architectures which would implement the enforced separation in silicon somehow. Although you&#x27;re still stuck not having access to modular transmitter rules but that was the case already.<p><i>> To make sure I understand, this would be an incentive for mobile phone manufacturers (for example) to continue to have separate radio firmware, even if they move to cheaper SoC designs, correct?</i><p>Indeed, although I have oversimplified somewhat - some basebands do run on the same CPU as the OS, but something resembling a secure hypervisor (with secured boot, among other things) is used to enforce isolation between the baseband and OS (see OKL4).",1443132388

That is a purely functional thing, no &quot;biological programming&quot; necessary. I am not making any claims about biological programming.<p>Are you saying plausibly women could be seized by the government and distributed to men to create children? I think this actually happens in some societies/cults, or it even was the norm in the past (and in the third world, where arranged marriages are the norm). But we are talking about western society here.<p>Still, it might not be that easy to distribute wombs - women can perhaps secretly abort pregnancies or use contraceptives, or make themselves infertile.<p>Again, if you have witnessed your wife giving birth, I think the idea to take the children away from her becomes quite absurd. There is a reason it is usually not randomly determined who gets to stay home to look after the offspring. (Historically presumably other factors, too, such as pregnant women and women after birth not being able to do hard manual work which was necessary for survival - so the division of work was a no-brainer).",1443132373

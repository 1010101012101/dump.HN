8797024,comment,8796454,8796917,0,0,scrollaway,,,"[Disclaimer: I am indirectly affiliated with Mozilla - I&#x27;m also an UX dev in addition to a programmer]<p>I don&#x27;t just remember Android 2.0: I have an HTC Desire phone running it (it can&#x27;t upgrade any further due to its limited hard drive space).<p>First impressions are awful: The Flame feels slow and extremely unpolished (the stretching is ridiculous, no progress bars in the system updates and other places, hard-to-find text-only buttons, missing fade-out effects...). The screenshot gesture/keybind that triggers almost every time I unlock the phone. Confusing wording all over the place. Performance issues everywhere, even on the lock screen and camera, etc etc.<p>These are just some the ones I gathered in the first couple of hours. I stopped writing them down... and I stopped using the phone altogether after two days. I wanted, I really wanted to contribute to it but the amount of basic UX issues made me feel like there is little QA/UX being done at all.<p>My FOSS time is limited. I have a job in FOSS, and I do LXQt work in my off time (in addition to personal project). Being put in front of Firefox OS made me feel like what you guys needed were more full-time UX devs on it, not an assorted basket of contributions. This is why it felt very hopeless to me.<p>This was a couple of months ago. I have to admit I did not update since, the phone just went unused. Upgrading it is on my TODO some time in the next few months, unless you tell me things radically improved since.",1419537494
8797023,comment,8796182,8796795,0,0,lucaspiller,,,"As I understand, it&#x27;s more of a cultural thing. I live in a Middle East country where a lot of low to mid-level workers are from India. If you want to get anything done it&#x27;s full of bureaucracy, things are done to the minimum standard of working (a socket in my apartment came off the wall, the handyman came to fix it and used a bit of brown tape - job done!), and people are always looking for ways to one-up themselves.<p>A company I&#x27;m working for is currently trying to build up a team in India (for lower costs), and all the problems we are facing are those described in the article. Given my experience with how they are in my country, combined with the company most likely paying the minimum, I&#x27;m not really surprised.<p>On the other hand I have a friend in the UK who has a couple of on-site developers from India working for him and he says they are great. Of course, I&#x27;m sure not all Indians work the way I have described, but I wonder whether for these guys they have picked up the Western way of working from living there.<p>(Apologies if I come off as harsh or offensive, I&#x27;m not saying the Western way is better than the Indian / Asian way it&#x27;s just different - which is where these outsourcing issues come from, as people expect outsourced developers to work the same as a local developer)",1419537463

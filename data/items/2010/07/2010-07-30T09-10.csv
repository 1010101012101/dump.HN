See <a href=""http://elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/</a> for an OSCON tutorial that I did on the topic a couple of years ago, which includes all the gory statistical detail you could want.<p>Furthermore I note with interest that 2 of the 3 statistical techniques he named (Student's t test and ANOVA) only apply to cases where the observed variables are themselves normally distributed.  Which is <i>not</i> a good description of binary yes/no outcomes.  As for the remaining test, it is appropriate to use a chi-square, but statisticians tell us that the g-test is preferable.",1280483537

For example, they appear to strongly respect intellectual property and corporate profits, as you might expect from a Microsoft founder. (This may take the form of ensuring that companies like Monsanto benefit from aid.)<p>There was an informed article in The Nation which touched upon the undemocratic vision the Gates Foundation allegedly has; people affected by poverty do struggle to fix their own problems in a self-governing way. Elite benefactors like Gates or Soros may conceivably help to strengthen the systems which make it hard to self-govern, along with whatever benefits they accomplish.<p><a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/gates-foundation-and-africas-hunger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thenation.com/article/gates-foundation-and-africa...</a><p>(Incidentally, I don't see why Gates is considered a particularly predatory businessman.

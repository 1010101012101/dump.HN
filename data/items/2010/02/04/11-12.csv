I bet they could build SPARC servers at Dell prices, if they wanted to have Dell quality.<p>""* they had a great start with Java applets but they weren't a company of creatives, like Macromedia/Adobe, and so they missed this opportunity""<p>To be fair, Macromedia bought a small startup FutureWave. Adobe bought Macromedia. Microsoft embedded Flash in every copy of Windows and rode it's monopoly to it's own.<p>""* Eclipse and the whole open-source community around Java practically took away their ability to sell any Java related tools""<p>Still, their C++ IDE is top-notch.<p>Open-sourcing Solaris may help fragment the Unix market and help drive it towards standards (as opposed to Linux being the de-facto standard)<p>JavaFX is free because nobody would buy it anyway. Network effects make Flash's stronghold nearly unassailable. Even Microsoft is having trouble with it.<p>""They also had the resources to pull something like Amazon's EC2 or Google's App Engine ... based on Solaris, Java and MySql. I wouldn've liked that, but they didn't""<p>Like the Sun Cloud Compute Utility?<p>And buying MySQL was downright stupid. In more civilized societies a CEO who pulls a stunt like this would be in prison.",1265284761

1100316,comment,1099229,1099551,0,0,maurycy,,,"I'm used to the command line interfaces. It is not that I need a GUI tool. I do not. It's just that, after a year, I'm still not 100% sure that I understand what every git command does. There's still something under the hoods going on that I do not trust. I do not want to use a GUI interface, which I trust even less.<p>Of course, you can either ask specific questions what causes me problems and answer them, or just reply me that powerful tool has a steep learning curve.<p>I reject this notion, though. Perforce, Darcs and Bazaar are similarly powerful tools, with their own trade-offs. None gave me so much headache initially, and relatively quickly I've got some level of comfort with them.<p>As for lack of ""git library"", I think you nailed it, if it's still true. +1. Lack of proper encapsulation is one of the biggest issues in the Linux tools' world. Most of the tools is ""as is"", and the only way to interact with them is the command line.<p>I know that this is a part of the Unix philosophy. It frequently, though, generates similar problems. The idea is excellent, yet the interface is horrible. It shouldn't be the case. Why give up excellent, already written, code and idea, because of something so trivial as interface?<p>It's especially visible in the world of package management software. Nearly all come as a package: their own format, their own repos, their own scripts, and the command-line interface. I still don't understand why there's neither single packages' format, nor scripts cannot be reused, and everyone reinvents the wheel on daily basis.<p>By the way, thanks for not downvoting me. I expected a different outcome.",1265284645

1100300,comment,1100034,1100034,0,0,patio11,,,"You have far, far more intestinal fortitude than I do to go into that business.  (It involves marginal work and low margins.  Yikes -- software sounds so much better.)<p>I'd say ""both"".  My reasoning is that you can use the B2C customers as the kindling to light the B2B fire -- they're cheap, easy to service, and numerous.  Get them to do your marketing for you.  (You can use your existing technology to quickly roll out linkbait mini-projects: web form + visual design + PDFification + a letter physically delivered to grandma = instant remarkable content.  You can launch one of these a week: Send A Solider A Valentine, for example.  That is probably a little late but you get the general tenor of the sort of emotional buttons I'd suggest you push.)<p>This gives you something to do while waiting for the phone to ring on the B2B deals, and will help you with SEO.  Why focus on B2B over the long term?  Well, it allows you to have much more predictable revenue, and having a lifetime customer value which could buy a pizza is very helpful once you start think of incremental-cost marketing options like, say, AdWords.<p>Mind if I give you the same advice I gave cperciva?  Thirty minutes on that home page will double your sales.  Heck, if you're in a hurry, you can do it in two: put a BIG OBVIOUS BUTTON on it.  I don't know, 10 kilopixels of big.  Maybe bigger.<p>If you have graphical talent, something I lack, I'd collapse the entire sales pitch into an illustrated:<p>1)  Put in address\n2)  Type letter (We take PDFs, too!)\n3)  Pay money and it gets mailed<p>I'd put the API & login links in the top corner and the bottom of your textual description, or somewhere similarly discrete.

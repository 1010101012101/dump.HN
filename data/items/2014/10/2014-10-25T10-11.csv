8507791,comment,8507632,8507782,0,0,tracker1,,,"Angular was started 5 years ago.. Node was barely a proof of concept, and the JavaScript tooling at the time was centered around jQuery.. version 2 looks to be 1-2 years away, and the changes they make are really nice.  I&#x27;ve chosen React + Flux for my current development, but in 2-3 years may well be looking to Angular 2.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to by critical about Angular... least of which is that it&#x27;s own dependency system doesn&#x27;t play well with others.  The reliance of jquery is pretty heavy (since most wind up including the full version, and the light version is loaded).  There&#x27;s a lot of extra boilerplate that the new design will tear down.<p>With node&#x27;s tooling in current JS development, package management and modularization have become really easy to do.  Testing has also gotten easier with this.  Yes, browserify and traceur add some overhead to the mix, but it&#x27;s still lighter than using the mega tooling stuff like jQuery.  And don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like jQuery a lot, and it&#x27;s a really nice toolkit... but sometimes you only need a screwdriver, and an adjustable wrench for a job, not the whole huge craftsman toolbox.<p>Another issue is simply that the current angular would be unlikely to have a story around server-side rendering, and I think that&#x27;s especially important for any next generation tools.",1414233345

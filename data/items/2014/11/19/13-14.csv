The number of large frameworks (in terms of popularity and usage) is not really found elsewhere.  The number of smaller plugins are vast.<p>It helps that companies like Google and Facebook have invested a significant amount of research power into designing frameworks and tooling around it.  Just from there two companies alone, we have tools like React, Angular, Karma, JSX, Jest, and now Flow.  Tooling that involves the browser more include Polymer and Traceur (ES6 to ES5 transpiler).<p>To contrast this, I have been doing development with Cordova the past week & writing Cordova plugins to fill in missing functionality - the plugin ecosystem with Cordova is horrid, and the documentation is often awful.  To compound it, Android developers don&#x27;t seem to believe in documenting their libraries well.<p>I will take the JS ecosystem any day when confronted with a choice like that.",1416405598

In Europe, we&#x27;ve plenty of good schools and universities, but capital is so much more readily available across the pond that entrepreneurs who need it readily flock to the SV or NYC in order to get it.<p>It also helps a great deal to have a consumer society that is on a constant lookout for the latest or greatest gadget, product or service.

8629994,comment,8624160,8629530,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"I may be dense but it seems to me that your registrar is still the trusted entity no matter what:<p>- they sell you the domain name. Doesn&#x27;t matter how you try to authenticate yourself to clients (cert pinning aside), the registrar can seize the domain at any point.<p>- they control what your authoritative name servers are. They could easily change these on you.<p>- they populate the whois database, which is used when you purchase your TLS certs. This means that a registrar can list joe@fbi.gov as you the contact, and have Joe get a completely valid cert.<p>- one important issue that the article does not mention is that you are forever locked into trusting the site operator. This means that you as a user already must trust another entity.<p>This, what I am proposing is that out of the current trust list: [site owner, registrar. CA] we cut out the CA. Once again, the registrar always trumps the CA in their ability to seize your domain. At the same time, the CA provides zero protection against the registrar misbehaving. This article talks about shifting trust from the CA to the registrar and how that&#x27;s bad. I posit that you already trust the registrar, forever (or as long as you are willing to use their TLD) so you would be strictly reducing the amount of entities you need to trust, never adding new ones.",1416405529

8629978,comment,8625222,8625729,0,0,lmm,,,"There&#x27;s certainly a hierarchy; if you don&#x27;t have typed data then you won&#x27;t benefit from generics. If you don&#x27;t have typed containers then forget about monads. If you don&#x27;t have simple monads then no point worrying about how to compose them.<p>And yet, as someone who&#x27;s been working in Scala for nearly 5 years now, more and more of these abstractions are starting to seem &quot;worth it&quot;. My first Scala code was quite imperative, mixing random effects left and right. But eventually I started handling async calls explicitly - or perhaps I should say, I became fluent enough in the language that I could make an explicit distinction between sync and async calls without in being too cumbersome - and then I reaped the rewards, with more reliable, more performant, more maintainable code. And then I did the same thing with error handling, replacing surprise exceptions with an explicit Either (stacking this inside the Futures), and again I found my code became clearer, easier to reason about.<p>I&#x27;ve just finished factoring out database access into a Free monad based construct, and for the first time in my life I can test database access in a smarter way than just creating a (possibly in-memory) testing database and hoping it does the same things a real database would do. The monad tools are good enough to make it easy - as easy as &quot;magic&quot; Spring AOP, but explicit and ordinary. I&#x27;ve written a library for dealing with monad stacks that I&#x27;m sure would have horrified myself of three years ago (<a href=""https://github.com/m50d/scalaz-transfigure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/m50d/scalaz-transfigure</a>), but I&#x27;ve come here through small incremental steps that have made sense at every stage (it helps that I&#x27;m a big believer in Agile). If I&#x27;d been dropped in it with a language like Haskell where everything has to be monadic from day 1, I think I&#x27;d&#x27;ve given up. I still wouldn&#x27;t use monads for I/O (at least, not yet) - the advantages don&#x27;t seem worth the overhead. But I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m working in a language where these things are possible, and where I can gradually adopt them in my own time.",1416405275

8629939,comment,8628843,8629710,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"A lot of the result depends upon how much energy your wife has to devote to homeschooling, after childcare and housekeeping. Unless she is above median/average, the answer is usually &quot;not much energy&quot;. From the way you wrote, it sounds like you leave the house to work. Even if that is not the case, our field is competitive enough that even an easy &quot;lifestyle business&quot; will see you devote half a day every three days at a minimum to your work, making it challenging for both parents to be heavily involved. If you work at home, like most around here (including myself) you probably work a full 40-50 hours per week if not much more. The erratic nature of much at-home working also wreaks havoc upon the routine many young children crave to establish the level of trust they require; there is some clinical evidence that the successful children in the Stanford marshmallow experiment were successful because they trusted parents, which translated into trusting adults, and hence trusted the adult who told them they would get an additional treat in the future). So really homeschooling on a practical, continuing basis comes down on the shoulders of one of the stay-at-home parents (or <i>the</i> one stay-at-home parent).<p>I can tell you what worked for me, and leave it up to you to collect sufficient data samples to judge your own situation. We bring in a nanny 12 hours a week, on three separate days (8 of those hours are with a nanny who speaks a second language for an immersive experience for the children). My SO taught at home from pre-verbal stage to 4; we turned what most houses would be the &quot;living room&quot; into the school/playroom for the children.<p>Our local homeschool groups don&#x27;t meet frequently enough to offset some of the lagging social development cues we suspected that were not aligning with our 4-yo&#x27;s advanced verbal skills (assessed to at least a year ahead of peers), so we placed (for 15 hours per week) our 4-yo into a pre-school that specializes in Precision Learning and Direct Instruction methods (these terms are sometimes associated with developmentally delayed children, but they work even better with developmentally appropriate children). The rest of the time we continue with our homeschooling. Results: within six months, our 4-yo leapt from average to a year ahead in math and reading, and (our suspicions were correct) went from being uncomfortable in groups to being the class clown (never knew the child had that in them).<p>I will tell you straight up front: this is expensive. There is no way around that. Since you mention a state, I assume you are in the US. Using private resources means you will likely pay property taxes partly for a public school system you will not use. One decision we took to mitigate that was to hunt for a house that was only assessed county property taxes, and still as close-in to the metro area as we could manage. We gave up the amenities of urban living, but our city is not densifying and is growing rather dysfunctionally IMHO so I consider moving away a net positive for our particular situation.<p>Between the nannies, part-time pre-school, and third-party activities we signed up for that we don&#x27;t have the equipment to teach (swimming and gymnastics), it is a significant chunk of change. However, I consider my children my most important investment, ever, and my capital allocation reflects that. As the children grow older, we do anticipate not having to spend quite so much on the nannies / housekeepers, so the situation does improve, but there are no easy answers here.",1416404892

Certainly, the worrisome trend of using containers as &#x27;lightweight VMs&#x27; (with nearly all the same attack surfaces as regular VMs) suggests the current container-craze is kind of unlikely to change things: your analysis is correct... there&#x27;s useless fat there on many layers. The question is how do we get rid of it?<p>You discuss changing the entire design process and electing to use compilers or languages that are capable of shaving off disused codepaths automatically. The problem with this idea is that declaring what is disused is difficult in a conventionally hacked-together-from-components unix-style system. The option to hack stuff together is precisely what makes it a lovely platform for getting things done, and it&#x27;s hard to retrain most developers/admins on to a greenfield platform (for an example of this approach see, eg. the Erlang or Clojure communities).<p>I have taken a different yet similar approach in my thinking[1] where one assumption is that behavioural profiling of a codebase from a very high (eg. OS, network) level should be generally applicable to any codebase, allow sidestepping the need to retrain developers, and yet still be able to whittle away much of this fat (though far from all of it). Things like grsec implement learning modes which allow this to be done at the system call level, network profiling is easy as is filesystem monitoring, etc.<p>When you step back and think about this junk, the sad fact is that the NSA was publicly releasing the kernel-level implementation for this stuff nearly 20 years ago ... and have likely been doing this for even longer. The academic community tries to provide mechanisms for provable correctness but the world&#x27;s time-sapped developers just chug along the same old tired path.<p>What we <i>really</i> need, I feel, is automated help that doesn&#x27;t require a difficult to achieve cognitive paradigm shift for current generation programmers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stani.sh/walter/pfcts/original/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stani.sh/walter/pfcts/original/</a>",1416404706

But don&#x27;t forget there was CVE-2013-5750 with Django&#x27;s PBKDF2 implementation<p>CVE-2013-5750 is a Symfony vulnerability, the Django one is CVE-2013-1443.<p>And of course it was fixed by limiting passwords to 4096 bytes, not 18.<p>An easy alternative (which has to be applied if you&#x27;re using bcrypt since it&#x27;s limited ~50 bytes of input) is applying length reduction through a regular cryptographic hash before applying the KDF[0]. Of course the cryptographic hash might still be DOS&#x27;d, but they tend to have a throughput of 100~300MB/s on commodity hardware so that&#x27;s less likely.<p>[0] HMAC actually does that internally: if the key (password) is bigger than BLOCKSIZE — 64B for hmac-md5 and hmac-sha1, it will pass it through the hash function once then pad it to BLOCKSIZE before doing its thing.<p>The pkbdf2 DOS is because PBKDF2-HMAC calls HMAC once per round, so (on passwords longer than BLOCKSIZE) it performs length reduction once per round, and the total input data for length reduction alone is thus rounds * pw_length.<p>Given pbkdf2 tends to have round counts in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands these days, the amount of data going through the hash function literally increases by several orders of magnitude… and for nothing since it&#x27;s the exact same operation each round.<p>Thus running e.g. SHA-384 on a password before handing it off to a KDF is probably a good idea in any case",1416404579

The process of agreeing to terms and conditions has become subconscious. Although I agree that the contract between Apple and the buyer is essentially worthless, it has only become worthless because of how consumer habits have evolved therefore essentially making our clicks non-consensual.<p>I can only state the problem as it&#x27;s not my place or area or expertise to state the solution but here&#x27;s my opinion; buyer/seller contracts aren&#x27;t standardised and therefore when people sign a contract they are not reading through it either because of:<p>1. Laziness\n2. Evolution/Habit<p>Therefore we need to somehow make it so there isn&#x27;t asymmetric information between the buyer/seller. This has to accomodate for the habits that have evolved through our evolution and somehow be more explicit to our newly formed habits. A shit suggestion would be: Standardise contracts for certain procedures e.g. getting a hotel room should have a standardised contract but then should have very short appendices that indicate any customisations that the hotel has made. As I said, it&#x27;s a bad suggestion but i&#x27;m sure someone else can and should solve the problem.<p>Although one question we should ask ourselves... should we re-invent the wheel for outlying situations like this one?

8629854,comment,8629162,8629162,0,0,tokenadult,,,"On the whole, freedom of contract (a characteristic feature of Anglo-American law since that body of law was located only in England) is a feature rather than a bug. Most of what we do each day in Britain, in the United States, and these days around much of the developed world is regulated by private agreements--that is, contracts--rather than by legislation or administrative regulations. That&#x27;s a good thing. Parties to contracts can dicker until they reach a mutually agreeable deal, or each party can avoid making the deal at all by doing business with someone else.<p>Contracts have effect in influencing human behavior partly because once in a while a court will enforce a contract against a party trying to weasel out of the contract. But when courts get involved, general constitutional, statutory, and administrative law is brought to bear on the terms of the contract. A court may be very reluctant to enforce a term of a contract that doesn&#x27;t allow a customer to complain about a company&#x27;s service. That could be regarded as &quot;against public policy,&quot; and public policy can be a judicial ground for NOT enforcing a contract. Moreover, a contract binds its parties, but doesn&#x27;t bind outsiders who didn&#x27;t enter into a contract, so a news organization like the BBC can report, &quot;Slimy company attempts to sue its customer for letting consumers know that the company gives bad service,&quot; and the contract will not stop that. Parties to form contracts often ask the moon, but the party that drafted the contract language will usually have the terms construed in favor of the OTHER party if the contract is litigated. So I don&#x27;t worry about this. I look over form contracts as I sign them (as, for example, when I buy an airline ticket or check into a hotel or rent a car) but I also stay aware of actual business practice as experienced by consumers as I buy products and services as a consumer. My most powerful recourse, always, is not to give a slimy company any repeat business, and to tell all my friends through every channel I have that I did (or did not) like a particular company&#x27;s product or service. Anyone can do the same.<p>AFTER EDIT: By the way, this is an international news story that I heard on the radio while I was just on a morning drive here in Minnesota, and the latest update is that the hotel has agreed to refund the &quot;fine.&quot; I&#x27;m trying to find a news story on the Web that verifies that.<p><a href=""http://www.itv.com/news/border/story/2014-11-19/hotel-fines-guests-to-be-refunded-for-bad-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itv.com/news/border/story/2014-11-19/hotel-fines-...</a>",1416403682

Dynamically discerning the underlying code, and allowing optional type annotation works _with_ javascript, as opposed to attempting to turn js into a completely different (and weakened) language.<p>Typescript (from MS) sounds a lot like what you describe - it doesn&#x27;t change Javascript, it just adds types to it (and makes some ES6 features available), and it puts a lot of work into playing nice with the wider JS ecosystem (e.g. via the definitelytyped project, which integrates type definitions for most popular &quot;third-party&quot; javascript libraries).<p>> That said, I am curious what solutions this solves that isn&#x27;t already solved by enforcing good code coverage. Full disclaimer, the largest js projects I&#x27;ve worked on were in the tens of thousands of lines, not hundreds of thousands, but type checking just seemed completely unnecessary provided a good coding guide and test coverage were maintained and enforced.<p>Perfect testing can do everything a type system can. But a type system can do it with less programmer effort, much lower maintenance overhead, and in a standard form that makes it easier to maintain. So you can do the same thing but cheaper - or, more realistically for how software is developed in most companies, you can get better reliability for the same engineering budget.",1416403479

I&#x27;m married to a teacher and wince almost every time I read something about what&#x27;s wrong with education because most of the problems I hear about are caused by social problems (usually symptoms of poverty). The public education system gets blamed for the effects but has very little funding or ability to fix the causes.<p>There are two main drivers: the most obvious one is that teachers are one of the largest unionized groups so there&#x27;s going to be a certain level of attack just from that particular culture war.<p>The less appreciated one, however, is the number of companies and investors who benefit from changes. A major policy change means billions of dollars in new textbooks, curriculum materials, etc. — and almost inevitably follows this cycle where test scores drop (boosters: &quot;see how bad it was&quot;; teachers: &quot;these kids have had the new approach for one year&quot;), improve as everyone has time to get used to the new system and then plateau at roughly where they&#x27;d been under the previous system. Each time you repeat, textbooks companies make billions.<p>The rise of charter schools gives an even greater benefit to attacks. Each student who switches is $10+K/year and there&#x27;s a lot less oversight on where that money is spent so you have room for modern CEO salaries, dividends to investors, etc. so there are plenty of people trying to jump in.<p>Attacking public schools also turns out to be a good strategy for a charter school to show results: the marketing appeals to the more motivated, generally higher-income parents, whose children were already likely to perform above average anyway. That helps the charter school and, if this happens enough like it does here in DC where this is about 40% of the students, lowers the public school ratings at the same time.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that there aren&#x27;t real problems in public education but rather that there are both no simple fixes and many people who stand to profit from ignoring the root causes.",1416403367

And you really still want to paint yourself as a victim; as a slave from birth. The problem with libertarians reappropriating words like this is that they water them down and stop real discussion from happening.<p><i>only because I happened to be born in a state which has them</i><p>Such a victim! My guess is that like most libertarians (and your handle plus being on HN), you&#x27;re white, male, skilled, and with a good income (for the record, I am). You may not be, but the chances are that you are. If so, you&#x27;re in one of the best-off demographics that has existed in the history of the world, and still you want to claim systematic victimhood. And yet, you&#x27;re trying to identify with slaves, basking in the reflected anti-glory of the word.<p>Here&#x27;s the rub: <i>you have a choice</i>. Particularly if you&#x27;re in the US. You can go off the grid easily. You can live on public lands, moving around. You can support yourself hunting. Or bartering. You can just not engage in things that connect you to the government. Plenty of people do - witness the huge amount of illegal aliens the US has. Hell, you can even emigrate, no-one&#x27;s stopping you. Millions of people voluntarily migrate every year, including out of developed nations into developing ones. Move to Vanuatu. Good weather. Happy people. Tiny government. No income tax (unless you&#x27;re a landlord). You can live the libertarian dream of few government services, choosing to hire your own garbage collectors and whatnot. Other places like that exist all over the world.<p>But no, you want the lifestyle that taxes provide, but without having to pay taxes. So you join a political movement that has no hope of ever gaining real traction with its ideals, all so you can paint yourself as a victim to make yourself feel better. If you want to live without taxes, <i>you can</i>. Bam, your &#x27;slavery&#x27; is over.<p>Libertarianism has great rhetorics and its members are skilled rhetoricians, but it has no answers for people who don&#x27;t have plenty of privilege - which is most people, and which is why it&#x27;ll never gain traction. Take the simple case of someone born with a congenital disease or subject to an accident that wasn&#x27;t their fault. Most other philosophies would say &quot;hey everyone, chip into the pot and that person can be helped&quot;, at least as an ideal. Libertarianism takes the &quot;only child&quot; approach of &quot;sucks to be you. making me share is <i>violent</i>, and therefore immoral!&quot;. For all its rhetoric, libertarianism is very short on practical answers.<p>So no, modern taxation is not slavery or anything like it, and you weaken the impact of the word by saying it is. And you can escape the slavery you see yourself in - you are tacitly choosing to remain within it. However oppressed you think you were as an infant (somehow by the tax you weren&#x27;t paying), you are now an adult, and you are choosing to remain within the system you despise yet can so easily remove yourself from.",1416402910

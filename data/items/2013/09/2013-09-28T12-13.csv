With motion sickness I common cause (or at least in me) is from reading in the car. In that scenario you are focused on something stationary while your senses all feel as though you are being propelled down the road. In this case you are focused on what honestly looks to me like a standard animation of a wormhole, while everything else is telling you that you are stationary.<p>The problem with this thought (thought of it while typing but too late to turn back) is that if focusing on something like a half second wormhole animation while sitting still makes you sick for the reason I suggested, then you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to do other basic things like watch television.<p>I&#x27;m not bashing Apple at all. Never said anything negative about them before, but I can say this. I&#x27;ve had an iPhone, an iPhone 3GS, an iPhone 4, and an iPhone 5. I&#x27;ve used iOS, 2.X.X, 3.X.X, 4X.X, 5.X.X, and 6.1.

Unlike C, people believe that that their skillset is the one required to build a complex server side application combined with a web ui.<p>If you realize the mismatch and account for it, you can build great php websites.  The problem arises when people assume they are getting a &#x27;faster/cheaper&#x27; .Net/Java stack and start to hire programmers into that structure.<p>The net result is a clash between people that are using PHP as intended, and people that have been subjected to the misuse of the php.<p>1. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5647598/cannot-import-use-a-namespaced-function-in-php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5647598/cannot-import-use...</a>",1380373016

6461669,comment,6461581,6461581,8,0,danso,,,"TDD is often praised for its documentation effect, vital for teams working on big projects with heavy moving pieces. But I&#x27;ve found TDD to be essential in projects in which I&#x27;m the main or sole coder. OftenI can&#x27;t finish every piece of a project in a single day, so I&#x27;m switching context and code bases quite frequently. TDD has been the only way I can keep on task, knowing exactly where I left off by running the suite. It also not only forces me to write more modular code, but it abets the reuse of code because if a module works in one project, I can extract it and put it in the others and can use TDD to immediately see if that raises issues.<p>Even for side projects, TDD has been essential...it&#x27;s so easy to let side projects die especially if you&#x27;ve forgotten where you left off. With some TDD, I can discipline myself to at least write a few tests today if I can&#x27;t muster the energy to do real code for the project...and often that little push ends up with lots of code being written....just as you can go on a five mile run as soon as you motivate yourself to get off the couch",1380372062

(o_O)<p>In general, if you&#x27;re wondering what causes high suicide rates, it&#x27;s a lot more useful to look at societal motivators than race.  As everywhere, there&#x27;s a strong correlation between depression and suicide, and it&#x27;s not hard to find the main causes.  In Japan&#x27;s particular case, the largest group committing suicide are the elderly, who have devoted their lives to their company and feel they have nothing left when they retire.  The second-largest group is the unemployed, particularly those who have fallen into debt traps that very often ensnare family and friends as guarantors, with life insurance providing an &quot;easy&quot; way out.  And the final group is students, who commit suicide to escape bullying or the immense pressure of their final exams.",1380370571

Why do people expect one device to match the functionality of all of the above inputs. They&#x27;re vastly different experiences, it&#x27;s simply not going to happen. Controllers work great for action games, platformers, and overall, they&#x27;re the best well rounded device. They&#x27;re not designed to compete with the above controllers, they&#x27;re a general input device, so they&#x27;re not going to be as efficient as something built for a specific task.<p>If you&#x27;re a hardcore FPS gamer, bring your mouse and keyboard into the living room, or play at your desk. This is no different than someone buying a wheel if they&#x27;re into racing simulators.<p>I think Valve is achieving an even more well rounded device. By the sounds of things, it&#x27;ll improve the FPS and RTS experience on a controller. It&#x27;ll most likely make sacrifices to achieve that goal. For example, fighting games might work better on a more traditional controller. However, the Steam library has a much higher number of FPS and RTS games, so that trade off makes sense.",1380370458

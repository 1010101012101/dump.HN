That would really be annoying for those people to have all that break in a way they would need to change all that baroque code instead of just adding an option, something like system(&quot;exec /bin/bash --foobarbaz ... &quot;) now.<p>Plus there are other programs like sudo that already know how to deal with the &#x27;() {&#x27; style env vars and clear them-out by default, people would have to update all those (plus what ever ancient suid C launcher programs they already had doing this kind of env var clean-up in their own broken ways from before the time sudo became the way to do this stuff) now too.",1411750640

8373530,comment,8372015,8372172,2,0,gioele,,,"> I will note the author appears to have aesthetic reasons to reject creating a PDF/e-book/etc version of the book, despite people literally offering him money to do so<p>I am one of those that offered money to buy the ePub version of his book.<p>I think the root issue here can be found in this sentence: «If you can show me an e-book for\u00ADmat that gives me the same con\u00ADtrol over ty\u00ADpog\u00ADra\u00ADphy and lay\u00ADout that I can get in a web browser, I’ll con\u00ADsider it. As far as I know, it doesn’t exist.»<p>So the author thinks that the typography of the book is important in itself. I see his point, but nevertheless I find _the content_ more important than the presentation.<p>Also, the author uses the expression &quot;con\u00ADtrol over ty\u00ADpog\u00ADra\u00ADphy and lay\u00ADout that I can get in a web browser&quot;. _A_ web browser? There are hundreds of possible web browser/OS combinations out there. For example, for the Windows users, the version of OS will drastically influence the way fonts are shown. In the ebook world, once you have tested with Kindle, iBooks and Kobo you have covered a huge share of users.<p>You can also see that the author is more interested in typography than HTML. He uses `<root><topic>bar</topic><root>` instead of `<h1>` and `<div class=&quot;subhead&quot;>foo</div>` instead of `<h2>`. So being able to perfectly control typography is paramount but publishing completely valid and meaningful HTML is not that important?",1411750185

Hopefully someone runs this with a noticeable payload (but not necessarily that malicious) to help wake people up.<p>OTOH, every single SIP stack I&#x27;ve tested is vulnerable to IP spoofing (due to the inane rules of SIP which make this attack very easy), yet IP auth is used extensively as <i>the</i> authentication system for wholesale VoIP traffic.<p>In addition, every VoIP system I&#x27;ve looked at as-a-whole has had all sorts of other vulnerabilities.

8373455,comment,8370199,8372044,2,0,graycat,,,"My main point is:<p>Just why is an information technology startup with\nexplosive growth potential, early on with just a few\nemployees, as described so vividly in Altman&#x27;s\nlecture, usually so different, say, in level of\n<i>desperation,</i> from most of millions of US small\nbusinesses?  That is, I&#x27;m not getting the solid\nreason for so much <i>desperation</i>.<p>On your 1) and a startup being a small business:<p>As a side point, for 1) your $100 K per employee per\nyear might even be too small.  I&#x27;d guess that in SV\nGoogle spends $300+ K per year per employee.<p>In your 1), you are assuming a lot of <i>burn rate</i>.\nYes, I know; I know:  Twitter long ran with rapid\ngrowth in usage, i.e., <i>traction</i>, with low or no\nrevenue but recently, from some VC Fred Wilson\ncomments, worked on revenue and is doing well with\nit.  Maybe SnapChat and Instagram burned a lot of\ncash with low or no revenue.  And maybe Square,\nUber, and some others have high burn rates.  And\nrecently VCs Bill Gurley and Fred Wilson, and, now,\nA16Z, are complaining about high burn rates.  I\nknow.  Still, from nearly all I&#x27;ve seen, coast to\ncoast, &quot;pre-revenue&quot; usually means $0.00 equity\nfunding.<p>So, connecting with my point above, maybe the\noffices of Square and Uber have some high level of\n<i>desperation</i> as described in Altman&#x27;s lecture, but\nfrom all I can see for information technology\nstartups with explosive growth potential and\njust a few employees, that such a high level of\n<i>desperation,</i> so different from nearly all of\nmillions of US small businesses, is necessary or\nusual seems difficult to believe.  Instead, with\njust a few employees, in nearly all respects the\nlevel of desperation should be just ordinary for\nsmall businesses.<p>Then there is the issue of <i>burn rate</i> and, thus,\nusually, VC funding:<p>from what I&#x27;ve seen, for a startup writing software\nand pre-revenue, about the best they can get from a\nVC is either &quot;it appears that you are still in heavy\ndevelopment&quot; (i.e., not a candidate for equity\nfunding) or &quot;when you go live with your service we&#x27;d\nlike to &#x27;play with it&#x27;&quot; meaning that nothing prior\nto that is worth equity funding.<p>That is, VCs want to see at least a product ready\nfor usage.  That is, they don&#x27;t want to pay for\nsoftware development.  That is, we get reminded of\nthe Mother Goose story of <i>The Little Red Hen</i> who\ngot no help or interest from anyone until she had\nhot, fragrant loaves of bread fresh from the oven\nand lines of eager customers out front.<p>So, what is a founder of an information technology\nstartup to do about equity funding?  A big point\nhere, at times also mentioned by VCs, is that now\nthe expenses, at least the capital expenses, for an\ninformation technology startup can be so low that\nreally, by the time VCs are interested, the startup\nshould be within just some weeks of getting users,\nads, revenue, earnings, and enough in earnings to\nhave a nicely successful small business with plenty\nof cash for organic growth and low to no need for\nequity funding.  So, from all I can see, usually by\nthe time VCs are willing to meet, there&#x27;s a\nprofitable small business or nearly so.<p>E.g., Menlo Ventures told me that they want to see\nat least 100,000 <i>uniques</i> per month.  Okay, for my\nWeb site that would be, say, for each <i>unique</i>\nvisitor, an average of, say, 8 visits a month with\nan average of 8 Web pages seen per visit, with an\naverage of 5 ads per page.  So, if take the Mary\nMeeker KPCB estimate of $2 revenue for each 1000 ads\ndisplayed, then get monthly revenue of<p>100,000 * 8 * 8 * 5 * 2 / ( 1000 ) = 64,000<p>dollars for my solo startup.  Moreover they want\nthat <i>traction</i> growing quickly.  At that time I&#x27;m\nlooking for equity funding?  I doubt it!  Even if\nthe $64,000 is too high by a factor of 10, still I&#x27;m\nnot looking for equity funding; instead I&#x27;m\nprofitable with plenty of cash for organic growth.<p>So, for equity funding, here is my<p>Point:  For information technology startups of just\na few people, nearly always, by the time the VCs are\nready to write a first check, the company doesn&#x27;t\nmuch need it.  Then what&#x27;s left for VC funding is\n<i>expansion stage</i> or, maybe, some funding in pursuit\nof the company being acquired.  Or, again, I&#x27;m not\nseeing as very common Altman&#x27;s description of VC\nfunded startups with desperation.<p>For your<p>> Can you think of a software company that reached\n$1.5 mil in year two?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what Microsoft, Plenty of Fish, etc.\ndid already in year two.  Still I&#x27;m lost on your\npoint here:  You seem to have an implicit assumption\nthat an information technology startup with\nexplosive growth potential must go at least two\nyears burning a lot of cash instead of making at\nleast a little in earnings, and I&#x27;m not seeing a\nvery good argument for that.<p>For 2), maybe the company is not in Silicon Valley?\nEven if the company has only a few employees and\nlevel of desperation like most small businesses, it\nmight still have explosive growth potential and a\ncorresponding &quot;vision&quot;.<p>You seem to be suggesting that there is high\ncompetition for good employees, say, in developing\nsoftware.  I very much do not see that at all:  From\nall I can see, the US is just awash in highly\nmotivated, highly talented, Bachelor&#x27;s degree and\nhigher graduates in STEM fields with some to a lot\nof software development experience who can send 1000\nresume copies and get back only silence or at best\nsome absurd questions about how many golf balls will\nfit in a school bus, a question &quot;What is your\nfavorite programming language?&quot; with, apparently,\nonly one acceptable answer, C++, or a requirement\nthat the candidate have several years of experience\nwith just the combination of software tools and\ninfrastructure the company is using that day.\nNonsense.

In a more just world real users would decide what succeeds and what does not.<p>My defense of the current site from a content perspective is simple: just go to it (www.rackforms.com).<p>I feel very strongly the look (clean professional), layout (easy to navigate), and technical details (fast, fully responsive, etc) are not causing it to be penalized from a content perspective.<p>My reasoning for why it should rank is also simple: it used to rank high, and none of that was an accident. I&#x27;ve always followed common sense methodology when creating it, such as creating content for humans, not search bots.<p>Never the less, since the penalty I&#x27;ve happily made dozens of changes, most of which were suggestions from kind and well meaning SEO folks -- none of them made a difference. Not a single one.<p>Conclusion -- my issue isn&#x27;t nor has it ever been content, it&#x27;s links.<p>Of course the irony is the vast majority of changes I made were to please search engine bots, not humans. Google has always said this is the opposite of what we should be doing.<p>For example, one guy suggested I used to word &#x27;form&#x27; too much on my home page, and Google may consider this keyword stuffing. And so I pruned it from 23 to 12. Trouble is I sell web form software, and let&#x27;s just say changes I made were, in many cases, a stretch -- many sounded decisively nonhuman. Who and what am I helping at that point? Google bot is clearly smarter than that. The kicker: the current page 1 site used the word &#x27;form&#x27; 43 times. It&#x27;s just silly voo-doo at this point, and no one except Google knows what the hell they&#x27;re talking about.<p>Here&#x27;s why this is all a bit scary: as link-penalized webmasters poke around the edges and make such changes, we&#x27;re getting further away from a site that used to be looked upon favorably by Google from a content perspective.<p>The reason I cite &quot;it used to be good enough&quot; is common sense. Yes we can always improve our site and we should be: but a link penalty, mine especially, is so thorough and so unrecoverable so far, that making loads of other changes will very likely hurt more than help.<p>But again, just visit my site, visit the page 1 and 2&#x27;s, and then consider I&#x27;m page 15 or lower.

This is fairly efficient and can be extended to a lot of different cases, though I&#x27;m sure there are more efficient specialized data structures for some specific types of queries.",1411748710

In short, we wouldn&#x27;t know what to do with those people if we had them.<p>To be clear, we still have plenty of money to get stuff done. We still can pay for all the tools we need, pay ourselves enough to not have to stress about cash, and can hire top talent. We just don&#x27;t have more money than we know what to do with.<p>We have three people working full-time on product right now, and that will grow to five in the next few months. If we had raised a $3 Million seed round (if you can still call that a &quot;seed&quot;), we would have felt compelled to go hire a dozen people. I can think of stuff we&#x27;d <i>like</i> to do, but it would probably be an absolute mess if we were building it all in parallel.<p>There may be some companies for whom building a huge war chest makes sense, but the notion of raising money for the sake of raising money (because you <i>can</i>) seems odd and dangerous to me.",1411748359

Founders also often don&#x27;t retain an ownership stake forever, since many businesses change ownership during their lifetimes, and others shut down.<p>So, in my example above, what if the person only retains a minority ownership stake in the restaurant, sold the two software companies, the property management company failed, and they are now working on a new company of any kind? Does &quot;business owner&quot; really accurately describe what they do?<p>Note that if you think this kind of example is unusual, in my experience it&#x27;s relatively common for people who build companies to do so in different domains, either simultaneously or at different stages in their careers.",1411747975

I feel like USPS is a temporary or secondary measure until Amazon ramps up their own delivery service in big cities. Part of the appeal of DIY delivery is same day/next day and Sunday service, and USPS can&#x27;t necessarily offer that.<p>In SF, Amazon already does some of the last mile deliveries, and I haven&#x27;t been impressed so far. A blender chucked over a ~8 foot gate so it busted the box inside despite a ton of packaging. A package that was left _outside_ the gate - when I live right on Market Street (if you don&#x27;t know local geography, it&#x27;s one of the biggest streets in SF)... that was stolen before I even realized it was delivered. Bonus points because it was a birthday gift but Amazon wouldn&#x27;t rush the replacement package showing up a day late. One package carefully put in front of the basement door, almost missed. Another wedged through the gaps in the gate and damaged. One time a person rang the doorbell and just dropped the box in front of the gate when they heard the buzz. Did I mention I&#x27;ve been home for all these packages and have no idea why people can&#x27;t just ring the doorbell and wait 10 more seconds? Lastly, I have an order going to a commercial address and I&#x27;m worried they might try Sunday evening delivery instead of a saner time like 9am on Monday for all other carriers.<p>USPS works because the same people tend to work the same routes and end up knowing a lot about when and where to leave things - I also know the UPS guy for my address and when he&#x27;s doing deliveries, it works flawlessly too.

Maybe there&#x27;s a different model you can consider where you&#x27;d have fewer customers, but those customers would be at a much higher price point.&quot;<p>Another model to consider would be to have different private label companies (that you control) serving up essentially the same product, priced differently, and offered through a different company name.<p>For example you have basecamp where you can manage unlimited projects at $3000 per year.<p>But it&#x27;s possible that Boeing might pay $50,000 per year if they got even a higher level of service and a personal account manager. [1]<p>Now you could do this by adding a tier to basecamp but you could also be your own competition with basecamp just for the bespoke offering.<p>Figures arbitrary to make a point.<p>[1] Sold by a professional sales force or some other higher cost method than adwords.<p>For example I&#x27;m helping to investigate, as a favor, solutions for Physician scheduling. I&#x27;m amazed at how cheap the service is. I know that the group that wants this would easily pay much more to solve the problem in a turnkey fashion. But the current offerings are being sold on price only as a way to get attention. (And not doing a good job at it for that matter.)",1374785982

The legality issue matters a bit, insofar as a potential competitor has notice that such business risks may occur, and can plan for them economically before entering the market, whereas people don&#x27;t reasonably expect to be rounded up and sent off to concentration camps fitted with gas chambers as a matter of course.

We don&#x27;t know that for a fact, but their behavior seems to imply that. I&#x27;ll admit, I find that a bit surprising, since I&#x27;ve never worked hard on a public-facing project without hoping people would use it and find it useful.<p>However from a global welfare perspective it clearly matters a great deal. The over-simplified but not-too-far-off math on the social benefit of a project is that global_welfare_added == (value_added_per_user) * n_users, so a positive multiplier on n_users is a positive multiplier on value so long as the value added is positive.<p>In this case, making the website look like an actual website isn&#x27;t about &quot;creaing a need&quot;, it&#x27;s about informing people who have that need (designers who need to edit vector graphics) that the product might fill that need. Currently the site doesn&#x27;t communicate that at all. Furthermore, that their demonstrated indifference to communicating the nature of their product to potential users makes me loathe to donate dev time or money to fund development of a product that will be little used by those who might value it.<p>> But I wouldn&#x27;t really want to divert resources towards marketing it and away from making it more usable and functional.<p>The tiny user base undoubtedly restricts the project&#x27;s access to resources in terms of donations of both time and money. Again, it&#x27;s easy to imagine why the authors would be indifferent to this, and my only point is that&#x27;s a shame for anybody who values a more widely-used project.",1374785787

6104785,comment,6103429,6103429,23,0,danneu,,,"Everyone interested in web dev should own a VPS.<p>After a year working at a Rails shop that deploys to Heroku, I decided it&#x27;s time to learn some sysadmin basics. Here are some things I&#x27;ve done the past couple months that might give other noobs some ideas.<p>- Make aliases for most Linux commands. Abstract Linux into a simple interface of aliases that you can browse in your .zshrc/.bashrc/fish.config. Linux becomes much more enjoyable when you can type `untar <file>` instead of remembering the magical incantation `sudo tar -xzvf <file>`. Make aliases for everything. nginx-reload. nginx-restart. alias z=&quot;vim ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc&quot;. I even abstract apt-get commands into ag-install, ag-update, ag-remote, etc.<p>- Use dropbox cli, a shared folder with dotfiles, and symlinks to keep dotfiles synced between your server(s) and laptop(s).<p>- Install tmux on it so that you can `$ tmux attach` to a persistent shell so that things still run when you close your remote connection and they&#x27;re still there when you log back in.<p>- Run weechat (terminal irc client) in tmux so that you never have to log out of irc again.<p>- Learn how to rsync up and down files from your server.<p>- rsync your Sinatra app (or whatever) onto your server and run it on port 5000, immediately see it live.<p>- Install nginx and have your VPS serve multiple domain names, each domain name pointing to a Sinatra app running on port 5000, 5001, and 5002.<p>- Run each website in its own tmux tab. At the beginning it&#x27;s easier to reason about a foreground process than some daemonized process.<p>- Install postgres or whatever database you use to your VPS. Get your db-driven app to connect to it. Connect to your remote db using your favorite db gui.<p>- Take notes of all the commands you use to set up each component so that you can refer to them later, see how you might have messed up.<p>- Learn enough bash/zsh/fish to automate all of those commands. Polish it enough so that you can curl your script from a Github gist on a fresh VPS and it will set up your entire environment.<p>- Install `htop` as a nice overview of your server&#x27;s stats and the processes that are running. Run it in another tmux tab. My tmux right now has a tab for weechat (irc), tabs for my Clojure apps, and an htop tab. On Friday nights I pretend I&#x27;m NASA mission control.<p>- Learn how to use the `ssh` command to reverse tunnel a connection from your VPS to an app you&#x27;re running on your local machine for a fast development feedback loop.<p>- Learn how to use your VPS to encrypt your connection when you&#x27;re working at coffee shops.<p>I&#x27;m still a noob but I leveled up considerably from this quest arc. I highly recommend.<p>I still don&#x27;t have a raging clue about most of Linux, even stuff like what all the folders are supposed to be for: /var/opt /etc/www /usr/local /usr/shared/local ... etc. and why files go the places they go, but it&#x27;s all an iterative process.<p>Email me (profile) if you need help with any of the bullet points. I am trying to shape it into a more helpful blog post to share with other noobs.",1374784380

Which I then did from day one, with effectively zero additional training.  Oh, and while holding down my old job -- and at times, repeatedly, also portions of the job I&#x27;d left before <i>that</i>, which they continued to underhire for and so continued to fail to fill successfully.<p>&quot;Management&quot;.

6104758,comment,6103716,6104420,1,0,berberous,,,"Yes, you are correct; part of what you are describing is also known as a control premium. Control premiums obviously exist, but they are likely to correlate to the market cap. For example, a buyer may be forced to pay a control premium of, let&#x27;s say 20%, to get a public company&#x27;s shareholders to agree to sell. So if the company has a $500 mm market cap, the buyer might end up paying $600 mm. But if the company later tanks and has a market cap of $250mm, a similar 20% premium, or $300mm offer, would likely still result in a sale, unless a majority of the shareholders believed that the shares were currently and unusually severely undervalued.<p>So I doubt that the price to buy the company would fluctuate much more slowly. And since market cap is an objective measurement, it&#x27;s often easiest to just think of the market cap, and keep in mind that you will have to pay a control premium if you actually wished to acquire the company.",1374784136

Perhaps I&#x27;m suffering from a sort of perverted Stockholm syndrome, but they work well for me.

It&#x27;s ironic because I was an early-adopter of Firebug back when it was first introduced, and it set the early standard of just how awesome in-browser debugging tools could be, but now I avoid it.

It is the OP article that your are not understanding.<p>You ask &quot;so how can the NSA decrypt such a message?&quot; That&#x27;s what the article is telling you: Either by 1) getting the private key from the corporation you are communicating with, or by 2) cracking the cryptography.<p>Most people don&#x27;t encrypt every email, they just use https to their email server. You say you&#x27;re not sure about https, but that is the big vulnerability. So NSA just needs to ask your emailserver corp for their private key (to decrypt the packets, and then everyone can deny that the NSA obtained <i>your</i> email from the corp). This is case 1) above.<p>For people who encrypt the message end to end (as in your example &quot;encrypt a message to someone I need to use that person&#x27;s public key&quot;), this is case 2). It is controversial whether the NSA can crack the best ciphers, which are postulated to be near-impossible to crack. But the NSA has resources we cannot imagine and/or secret resources we cannot even know about. When the first encryption schemes came out, they were strong in the day but were later brute forced by more power computers. So there are some who think the NSA can or will be able to crack the current crypto (that&#x27;s what the OP is referring to when he says &quot;the means to subvert widely used mechanisms&quot;). As others have said, in targetted cases like this, it may be easier for the NSA just to plant a bug on the receiving computer, to read contents after it has been decrypted.<p>Now certs, which you have half wrong. Yes, certs give confidence that you have the correct public key. But certs are mostly used by companies (case 1 above) not individuals (case 2).<p>In case 2, peer-to-peer encryption, individuals rarely go to the expense of getting trusted certificates. You say &quot;let&#x27;s take this private&quot;, and you send him your public key, or he sends you his--no cert involved.  Instead you both rely on publishing your public keys everywhere and all the time (at the bottom of every email, on their website, etc.). That provides some history for you to trust the key he sends you--and vice-versa. In other words, public keys MUST be displayed publicly before you want to use it to gain credibility.<p>Certificates are a way for companies to publish their public key with a credible certificate authority (CA). A certificate is essentially another public-private key pair that lets you determine that the CA really endorses the public key you are interested in. The credibility of the CA is determined by their record in the marketplace as to whether they endorse credible companies and whether they keep their master keys secure.<p>The original article really doens&#x27;t address certs, except to say that if master keys can be deciphered, we cannot trust certs anymore. That&#x27;s because a malicious party could create a cert that looked real but wasn&#x27;t (this happened recently when somebody stole one of the master keys used by a CA--they were able to make fake certs).<p>My question to you is: if you misunderstood the article, why are you taking such strong positions in your other comments?",1374783656

6104698,comment,6103716,6104517,2,0,jcnnghm,,,"Actually, the premium is usually a multiple of the present value <i>added</i> by the combination of the two companies.  Imagine two airlines with many different routes, but a bit of overlap.  If they merged, some of those redundant routes could be eliminated, which would reduce the costs and probably increase utilization on the remaining routes, they may also be able to sell the redundant planes and terminal slots.  This could potentially represent billions of dollars of value above the sum of the values of the two companies separately.<p>Think about how you would divide this premium between the target and the acquirer.  It&#x27;s actually pretty simple, imagine the next best possibility for the target.  If there are many acquirers, the target should appropriate most of that value, hence, a high premium.  If the next best alternative isn&#x27;t as good, the acquirer should capture value.  It follows logically that the optimal rational bid for a company is slightly more than the value added in their second best alternative (as an aside, this is really close to how IPO pricing works).  Companies aren&#x27;t necessarily rational though, so in competitive acquisitions companies frequently pay more than the actual value added.  Empirically, acquirers in single-bidder acquisitions typically see price-appreciation of about 2% in event studies, whereas acquirers in multi-bidder acquisitions typically see price drops of about 1.33% in event studies.  This indicates that acquirers in single-bidder acquisitions typically appropriate some of the added value, whereas in multi-bidder acquisitions, the target company captures all of the value added (plus some) by the acquisition.<p>A really interesting example of this was RJR Nabisco in the 80s.  The idea was to separate RJ Reynolds, the tobacco company, and Nabisco, the food company.  RJR was a cash machine, but they had a huge uncertain liability from tobacco lawsuits that was depressing the value of the entire company; the separated company was worth a lot more than the company was together.  It was trading for about $55/share, then KKR structured a LBO to buy it and break it up, and paid $109/share (management initially bid $75/share for a takeover).  In that case, there were many bidders, so the vast majority of the value was appropriated by the shareholders (in fact, KKR didn&#x27;t generate a good return). [1]<p>In general, the market cap is the best indicator of the true value of a company in it&#x27;s <i>current configuration</i>.  That does not mean there is not some other configuration or combination where the company could be worth a lot more.  It&#x27;s worth mentioning that whenever the market price is incorrect, there is an arbitrage opportunity available to move the price to its true value.  HFT is basically designed to capture these opportunities almost instantly, which is exactly what you would expect if markets are efficient.<p>1: I highly recommend the 1993 HBO movie <i>Barbarians at the Gate</i>, about this LBO.",1374783547

6104684,comment,6103453,6103453,15,0,aliguori,,,"This analysis of steal time is not entirely correct.<p>Steal time exists to fix a problem.  When a hypervisor needs to pre-empt a <i>running</i> guest, without steal time, when the hypervisor eventually resumes that guest, as far as the guest can tell, the process that was running when the whole guest was pre-empted had run the entire time.<p>This means that if a guest is pre-empted, then CPU usage reporting in the guest becomes horribly wrong with some processes having much higher reported usage than they actually got.  This affects fairness and can cause lots of bad things.<p>Steal time is simply a way to tell a guest that it was pre-empted.  The guest OS can then use that information to correct its usage information and preserve fairness.<p>However, it is not a general indication of overcommit.  When a guest idles a VCPU, that VCPU will be put on the scheduler queue.  It may receive an event that would normally cause it to awaken the VCPU however if the system is overcommitted, it may take much longer for the VCPU to be woken up.<p>Most clouds are designed to allow multiple VCPUs per physical CPU too and there certainly is capping in place.  You can still see steal time even though you are getting your full share.<p>Let me give an example:<p>1) You are capped at 50%.  You run for your full 50%, go idle, the hypervisor realizes you&#x27;ve exhausted your slice, and doesn&#x27;t schedule you until the next slice.  No steal time is reported.<p>2) You are capped at 50%.  You have a neighbor attempting to use his full time slice.  Instead of getting to run for the first half of your slice with the neighbor running for the second half, the hypervisor carves up the slice into 10 slots and schedules you both in alternative slots.  Both guests see 50% steal time.<p>You will get the same performance in both scenarios even though the steal time is reported differently.",1374783410

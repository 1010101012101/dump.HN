I had an idea, one co-founder said ""I think it could be done."" The other guy, we asked to join when we saw him walking back from class because we were talking about getting someone who was a good hacker.",1194479968

We'd be ready to anticipate and answer questions before they come up. We also would have probably learned about preparing our data so that anything not flattering isn't included.",1194479799

77210,comment,76630,77148,0,0,jsnx,,,"For mnemonicsloth to make a strawman argument, he'd first have said something like ""some people say <poor argument for $x>"" and then go on ""however, <picks apart argument>, so we know $x is false"". Therein lies the fallacy -- a disproof of a proof of $x is not a disproof of $x.<p>In other words, it's not about presenting a person as a poor defender, it's about presenting a poor defense. Cutting straight to a person's worth as a commentator -- as mnemonicsloth did -- is argument ""ad hominem"" (""to the person"").

Just run a VMWare or Xen instance of Windows XP inside Linux and you can switch back and forth on the fly for that type of stuff. It works great for development.<p>The problem is paravirtualization still isnt supported in the x64 kernel. So its still too slow to do heavy tasks in.

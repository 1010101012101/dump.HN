There is no team social dynamic in a white-board interview. There is one person in a position of power who is judging you with a critical eye. The other person is being judged and either really wants this job or, worse, <i>needs</i> the job.<p>That is the social dynamic in the room.<p>That doesn&#x27;t go away by saying &quot;Let&#x27;s play pretend like we are working on a project as equals&quot;.<p>Interviewers will often discuss their rationale as if the candidates know what it is, or that they should be able to know it.<p>For instance, &quot;I want to see if they can take suggestions and run with it&quot;.<p>Great, how does the candidate know that&#x27;s what you want? Maybe the last interview they were in wanted to see if they could take bad advice and quickly explain why that strategy wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>Those both look the same from a candidate&#x27;s point of view. They need to toss the dice and assume they interpret your intentions clearly.<p>> <i>Being willing to jump through hoops means you&#x27;re willing to cooperate and go the extra mile</i><p>I don&#x27;t know if I fully agree, but working at a big company <i>does</i> involve a lot of hoop jumping in your day-to-day, so I guess it <i>is</i> something good to test for.",1441299463

10166036,comment,10163914,10163914,0,0,jcfrei,,,"I feel like land is such a good example of the destructive powers of a good with a heavily deflationary value (deflationary due to policies and not by nature). It just leads to hoarding and benefits the early buyers, while at the same time hindering innovation because people who can make better use of the land cannot afford it. Land use regulations are probably one of the biggest blunders in modern capitalist economies. And the worst of it: The problem is not even visible to a lot of people: Very restrictive building codes in European city centers are rarely ever questioned - this wouldn&#x27;t be of much concern if we talked about single digits km^2, but usually they affect huge districts. Incidentally land ownership was for many historically despised &quot;capitalists&quot; the goto way of acquiring wealth: If you have an emerging company which requires lots of labour, the best investment you can make is building company housing for your employees, that way a part of the salary you pay ends up right back in your pocket. All you have to do then is lobby for restrictive building regulations and your family&#x27;s wealth and estate is secured for centuries to come.",1441299420

Review your commits together.<p>Every other reviewing scheme I&#x27;ve seen quickly becomes an unacceptable bureaucratic drag on forward movement.<p>At best you wind up with an average of around 2-3 days lag, giving plenty of time for the original engineer(s) to lose context and for the master branch to be well out in front.<p>At worst you have patches sprinkled around multiple branches of multiple repos, everyone is blocked on everyone else and continuous integration is thought of as a joke about mathematicians.<p>The original literature on code reviews is based on a very particular and extremely rigid manner of developing software.

But you can now go on YouTube and watch only new videos of cops behaving badly every waking moment of your life.  They shoot dogs.  They beat up handcuffed suspects.  They arrest protesters for trespassing on public property.  They use pepper spray from 30 cm away against nonviolent protesters.  They make racist and sexist remarks.  They shoot people in the back and drop a weapon next to the body.  They literally murder people, on camera, and are not required to take any personal responsibility for it.<p>You should give a cop no more deference than you would ordinarily give to any other person who could murder you on the spot and get a paid vacation as his only &quot;punishment&quot;.  Be respectful, and they <i>probably</i> won&#x27;t kill you, or do a roadside body cavity search, or arrest you for resisting arrest, or drag you to multiple hospitals until they find a doctor willing to comply with their ethically dubious and medically unnecessary requests, or shoot your dog, or simply trash your car while performing a &quot;search&quot;.<p>Be respectful, and they won&#x27;t punish you for &quot;contempt of cop&quot;.

I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen a system better than .NET&#x27;s. Because of the way it is built, you can still write type safe code. That&#x27;s impossible to do in JS.<p>I think people forget that, in JS, the types still exist. Just because it&#x27;s not statically typed doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t have to think about types and what types are appropriate for given scenarios.<p>With JS, it&#x27;s impossible to tell just from inspecting a reference to a function what it expects from you and what you can expect to give back. You have the length property to tell you the number of arguments and that&#x27;s it. Of course, that&#x27;s assuming it&#x27;s not using a variadric arguments pattern, in which case the length value only tells you the minimum number of parameters expected, but not that more are possible.<p>Even if you can make reasonable assumption about the number of parameters, you won&#x27;t be able to tell at all what types the function expects for those parameters. Want to list all the functions in a class that take two numbers and return a different number? Can&#x27;t do it.<p>But still, if you could make reasonable assumptions about the type of things that go in and out of the function, you won&#x27;t know how to even call the function. Does the function expect to be called as a method of a class? Does it expect to be called as a static function? The best you can hope for is to toString the function and check if the source includes the word &quot;this&quot;. Here&#x27;s hoping it&#x27;s one written in JS itself and not one that is implemented internally in the browser.<p>Now before anyone says &quot;why would you ever need anything like that?&quot;, it&#x27;s an absolute necessity for building any sort of user-driven or data-driven reporting system. You need to be able to tell when your data set matches the functions you want to apply to them, at run-time, because the data isn&#x27;t available at design-time. It&#x27;s the classic reflection use case.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, safety-guaranteed reflection is impossible in JS, unless you throw away JS functions almost completely and create your own Functor class with all the extra type information that you would need.",1441298984

Would they be able to work together with you? Can they understand you? Can you uderstand them?<p>Those are all vital components to success, and you can&#x27;t see those answers from a test. But white boarding is excellent for answering all those questions.<p>A quick word about hoop jumping. Being willing to jump through hoops means you&#x27;re willing to cooperate and go the extra mile, and that you want to work at the company in question.  This is a useful filter for the employer.

dime, and, with it, started up the coffeepot. Sniffing the - to
him - very unusual smell, he again consulted his watch, saw
that fifteen minutes had passed; he therefore vigorously
strode to the apt door, turned the knob and pulled on the
release bolt.<p>The door refused to open. It said, “Five cents, please.”
 He searched his pockets. No more coins; nothing. “I’ll
pay you tomorrow,” he told the door. Again he tried the
knob. Again it remained locked tight. “What I pay you,” he
informed it, “is in the nature of a gratuity; I don’t have to
pay you.”<p>“I think otherwise,” the door said. “Look in the purchase
contract you signed when you bought this conapt.”<p>In his desk drawer he found the contract; since signing it
he had found it necessary to refer to the document many
times. Sure enough; payment to his door for opening and
shutting constituted a mandatory fee. Not a tip.<p>“You discover I’m right,” the door said. It sounded smug. 
 From the drawer beside the sink Joe Chip got a stainless
steel knife; with it he began systematically to unscrew the
bolt assembly of his apt’s money-gulping door.<p>“I’ll sue you,” the door said as the first screw fell out.
 Joe Chip said, “I’ve never been sued by a door. But I
guess I can live through it.”<p>A knock sounded on the door. “Hey, Joe, baby, it’s me,
G. G. Ashwood. And I’ve got her right here with me. Open
up.”
 “Put a nickel in the slot for me,” Joe said. “The
mechanism seems to be jammed on my side.”<p>A coin rattled down into the works of the door; it swung
open and there stood G. G. Ashwood with a brilliant look on
his face. It pulsed with sly intensity, an erratic, gleaming
triumph as he propelled the girl forward and into the apt.",1441297082

The in-person discussion could involve throwing new requirements and hypotheticals at the problem to see how the candidate thinks on their feet, but it would still be relevant to the work they did at hand rather than some arbitrary puzzle pulled from Cracking the Coding Interview.<p>I would be interested to know how the hoop-jumping-to-whiteboard process came to be standard.

Is there any other options? I&#x27;ve tried the few obvious ones that come up when Googling but none of them are as seamless and simple as I&#x27;d like. Does anyone else do this?

It has many theoretical virtues. Most taxes dampen, distort or displace economic activity by changing incentives on the margins. But a land tax cannot reduce the supply of land, and it would stimulate economic activity by penalising those whose land is unproductive. And your tax base is always right there—a city lot cannot be whisked off to Luxembourg.<p>The mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, hopes that taxing vacant lots by value will help deal with urban blight in the Bronx and elsewhere. But there are practical problems with a land tax—perhaps the largest of which is that by its very nature it hits the well-connected rich hardest. Even fiscally purist Estonia, which adopted a land tax in 1993, has complicated it with multiple bands, including an exemption for homeowners.&quot;<p>As criticism goes, that is so weaksauce it&#x27;s a 0 on the Scoville scale.",1441296223

I think you&#x27;re then supposed to look at the supply and demand of skills, and try to gain a skillset that will be in high demand but with a limited supply. For example, building CRUD forms has probably reached peaked demand, and the influx of programmers in low wage markets is going to put downward pressure on wages for decades to come, so no matter how well you keep up with tools, you don&#x27;t want to be in that market for the next few decades.

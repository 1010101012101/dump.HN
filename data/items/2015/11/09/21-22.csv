10536083,comment,10525582,10535655,0,0,mikeash,,,"The difference is that in C and derived languages, nullability is completely tied to pointer types. All pointer types are nullable, and no non-pointer types are nullable. Having nullability/optionality be a separate concept makes everything nicely composable and solves some big problems.<p>If you have an interface which returns a pointer that&#x27;s never NULL, you still have to return a nullable pointer. The non-nullability of the value can only be encoded in documentation or naming conventions. Because of this, the language has to make it easy to use pointers without first checking for NULL, otherwise all these interfaces would become a giant pain in the ass to use. And that means that when you&#x27;re working with an interface which <i>can</i> return NULL, you have nothing that forces you to check for that. You just have to remember. It&#x27;s similar for function parameters.<p>Optional types also work for non-pointer types, which C&#x27;s NULL simply cannot do. That&#x27;s a major plus, beyond the problem of all pointers being nullable.<p>You&#x27;re right that an optional type is actually two types. But it&#x27;s designed such that you can&#x27;t get at the underlying runtime type without first checking to see what it is. That&#x27;s a huge difference.",1447105942

It wasn&#x27;t so much that I didn&#x27;t want to pay for anything.  We subscribe to digital cable with HBO, Netflix, and Amazon Prime.  My girlfriend watches cable a lot on the living room TV but I usually watch everything via HBO Go, Comcast On Demand, Amazon streaming, or Netflix.  It&#x27;s typically just easier than futzing around with the terrible DVR and I tend to pick up a show and watch it in chunks/seasons.<p>The thing that really struck me about Popcorn Time wasn&#x27;t the fact that it was &quot;OMG piracy!&quot; or anything groundbreaking (torrents aren&#x27;t new and some clients feature watching while you download).  It was the fact that I could skim through every show, bookmark favorites, and see which episodes I already watched.  You could search by genre or popularity or year like on Netflix.  And there were no issues of trying to figure out which service has the show I want to watch, which one has the site that only works properly in that one browser, etc.<p>My takeaway, as someone who constantly flirts with cord-cutting, is that I&#x27;d totally pay someone (even Comcast) for a legal service like that.  Hell, I&#x27;d even pay $50/mo or whatever cable costs on top of my internet service.  In fact, I might even pay more because I could skip some of the other subscriptions.  In fact, if cable is feeling the crunch from Netflix, then maybe they ought to out-Netflix Netflix.<p>I already treat Netflix like a low-cost equivalent to basic cable where you can&#x27;t just go in expecting to find a certain new movie or show but you can usually flip around and find something you&#x27;d like to watch.  I understand why it would be tough for some companies to negotiate the contracts for all that content but if anything, cable companies have loads of experience and existing partnerships for this sort of thing.<p>TL;DR:  I&#x27;d gladly pay $50/mo for a legal Popcorn Time that delivers current and previous seasons of lots of shows in an easily searchable and bookmark-able interface via on-demand streaming.  Streaming shows/series isn&#x27;t new anymore but the missing piece is consistency and a single interface.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d screw it up in reality but if I&#x27;m fantasizing about the &quot;perfect TV&quot; that I&#x27;d gladly pay for, that would be it.",1447105895

I could believe that certain kinds of programming fall into that bucket.<p>How about heart surgery? If you or a family member needed to have a risky or complex medical operation done, would you prefer to use a specialist in that field who has done that surgery for 15 years, or would you prefer to be operated on by a surgical resident who is qualified to do the surgery but has limited experience? Which doctor has better average patient outcomes?<p>Programming alone is not the only discipline that businesses need. They also require skills like leadership, business sense, product and design sense, etc. There are many kinds of aptitude that one develops by <i>having done something before</i>. Imagine that your programming task requires designing a new Linux kernel API. Two programmers have equal experience, but one built Ruby web applications, and the other was a kernel developer who designed cgroups. Who will have the advantage in designing the new API?<p>Relevant experience in any area that&#x27;s broad like business or medicine will tend to make someone better. I believe that you can craft a set of &quot;programming challenges&quot; that will show that people with limited experience can perform as well as those with much experience - I don&#x27;t think that programming challenges benefit from the kind of judgment and insight and leadership that experience brings. Experience benefits some tasks, but not all of them. Furthermore, knowledge in some areas might be relatively shallow. The Peopleware study purports to be about &quot;knowledge of a platform&quot; according to a blog:<p>> Once they had six months under their belt, the platform knowledge was no longer the bottleneck in their abilities.<p>Six months might be enough to reach 99% diminishing returns for knowledge about the platform. I can believe that. I don&#x27;t think this establishes a general point about the effect of experience on performance. Experience benefits some tasks more than others. I doubt that six months is the point of diminishing returns for heart surgery, for example, and for many types of engineering.<p>Broadly, I don&#x27;t understand the alternative belief: are we saying that people do not become more effective with experience <i>at all</i>, for any task? Not even a little?<p>I certainly study diligently and apply myself every day toward getting better, and I certainly seem to be getting more effective in a variety of ways. But I cannot believe that we are fixed as humans the day we turn 18, and can become no more competent than we were then. It violates common sense. The fact that experience might have diminishing marginal returns after a certain point does not mean that experience is worthless, though it may mean that <i>for that task</i> you don&#x27;t benefit from hiring someone with any more experience than that. But, to hire in such a specific way as that, you need to know what the cutoff is across every type of expertise that matters. If we conceptualize performance as skill across a range of dimensions, then probably many of them improve with experience, though not all will.<p>I believe that larger-scope tasks are likely to be the ones that benefit the most from experience, such as: leading a business, or designing a large system, or high-leverage pieces of engineering such as kernel APIs. Programming challenges and other tasks &quot;in the small&quot; likely benefit less after the cutoff. For example, in medicine, I could believe that once you have a certain amount of experience drawing blood, that more experience does not make you much better at finding a vein and getting the needle in properly. A doctor with 15 years of experience will probably not perform much better at that task than a nurse with more limited experience. That&#x27;s a task with (I&#x27;m just assuming) a low skill ceiling. Other tasks, like leading a heart surgery, or leading the design of a large system, have a far higher skill ceiling.",1447105470

I&#x27;m not trolling, I&#x27;m making a general plea for more cool headed reasonable human interaction.<p>That is like politely asking people to not park in handicap spaces instead of handing out tickets in the hundreds of dollars.  The reason the tickets are justified is because it wasn&#x27;t an accident (I&#x27;m sure a small number of cases are and it might be possible to get it tossed if the space is improperly marked).  They purposefully, and dare I say selfishly, made the choice to do something they knew they shouldn&#x27;t have which can cause problems for others.<p>Yes, you could respond politely, but at a certain point politeness doesn&#x27;t really cut it.  Which is why we have tickets.<p>>You&#x27;re doing far more harm to them than they did to you. That kind of enforcement just makes the world a much more unfriendly place, and does not serve the common good.<p>A couple hundred dollar ticket can really mess up a lower income family, and they were only using the space for a couple of minutes while they ran in to buy some milk/drop off a letter/what have you.

Typically, the hiring manager thinks about what he needs and reduces the hiring question to: &quot;For this role, we need a person with these skills or better, and we&#x27;re willing to pay this amount or less.&quot;<p>Then you evaluate candidates to determine their effectiveness.<p>Many factors impact someone&#x27;s relative effectiveness: if they take time off work for any reason, then they are less effective than someone who is equal in other ways but works full time. You simply get more weeks of effort out of them for the same pay - it&#x27;s really simple. It has nothing to do with being &quot;unacceptable&quot; so much as a &quot;bad deal for the employer&quot;.<p>Imagine that you&#x27;re considering two candidates, one who you believe will work full time, and another who you think has 25% chance of working half-time (while being paid for full time) over some period. The two employees are equal otherwise. The expected value of the first worker is 100%<i>1.0 = 1.0, and the expected value of the second worker is (25%)(0.5) + (75%</i>1.0) = 0.875. Thus by going with the first worker, your expected outcome is 14% better.<p>Imagine that the second worker is 10% better than the first. Then his expected value is (25%)(1.10/2) + (75%*1.10) = 0.96, or still worse than the regular worker. The worker who is 25% likely to work half-time must be 15% better in order for their expected value to equal a normal worker.<p>The results change rapidly if they are more than 25% likely to take time off, and if they work less than half-time. If they are 25% likely to stop working completely, then they have to be 33% more competent in order for the expected value to equal a regular worker.<p>All of this ignores the practical complexity of employees who take time off work unpredictably. The problem is that for the company to function, the job still needs to get done, which means burdening other employees, or hiring more employees - but if you hire another employee, then they won&#x27;t be needed when the first employee comes back, and they are by law entitled to their same job.<p>A simple rational analysis shows that workers who work full time have a better expected value for an employer, and are a lot simpler to deal with because they&#x27;re predictable and you can plan around their schedule.",1447104726

But here I am thinking about moving backward again after having crossed that rubicon.<p>Three&#x27;s problem is that even if 95% of stuff is on it, basically 100% of stuff is on 2.7, <i>including brand new stuff</i>. Let&#x27;s say you use 10 libraries on average and 95% of libraries have been ported. The odds of having one library missing are still 40%! (1-0.95^10) This ratio goes up the more specialised your work, or the greater your investment in legacy, which is why most 3.x people are generalists/web where they cannot understand the 2.x position. For me this Tensorflow library transports me right back into exactly that 40% problem. That problem does not exist the other way around unless you at all costs need to use Asyncio instead of something that&#x27;s already been there for years.<p>In my case I&#x27;m going to persevere and put 2.7 back into a virtualenv or something but it&#x27;s really not ideal and my point is still that if 3.x gave science/engineering people something properly compelling (@ operator is not enough in my view) then the above problem would not be happening.<p>For example a difficult-but-possible megawin would be to put GPU computing natively into Python. GPU is more than 50% of the compute silicon in most computers nowadays (Iris 6200 uses up 50% of die size in recent Intel core i7). If you include multicore and discrete GPU then standard Python is only targeting about 10% of the available compute silicon in a modern PC!

For someone who loves to learn, college can be a lot of fun, even if it&#x27;s not &quot;applicable&quot; or perfect.<p>> <i>college is not a place for smart people</i><p>I&#x27;ve never met a smart person who didn&#x27;t go to college. Also, all the smartest people I know went to college. I&#x27;m positive there are exceptions to this. I think I&#x27;ve seen them on HN. The problem is that they&#x27;re very, very rare.<p>None of those smart people think college made them smart, nor do they think the college system is amazing. But they knew that their degree would prove that they could do... something. What is that something? It depends on who looks at that degree. I agree with you that it doesn&#x27;t mean as much as people think, but to most people, it means <i>something</i>.<p>In a country where most people go to college (and almost all smart people go to college), I don&#x27;t need to hire people without degrees because I have alternatives. I&#x27;m never that desperate for employees. Colleges are nonprofits, and they can take a chance on you. I don&#x27;t want to be the first one to take a chance on you.<p>College may not be a place you liked, and it may not be right for you, but it tells employers that [insert college here] thinks you&#x27;re smart and capable. It&#x27;s social proof that you&#x27;re able to play the game.<p>From your post, it seems like you have yet to learn that, if you want to succeed in society (get a job, have an interesting career, etc.) you have to do things you don&#x27;t want to do or don&#x27;t find valuable. That&#x27;s life. You don&#x27;t have to do absolutely everything that other people do, but there&#x27;s a balance.<p>Hopefully someday you&#x27;ll be an employer who doesn&#x27;t care too much about college. You can help change the system.<p>(As a side note, your writing and language skills are very poor. I hope that your cover letters, resumes, and emails don&#x27;t look like this.

Then, when we&#x27;re all back at the hotel, thoroughly miserable, someone asks, &quot;Why are we even here?&quot;  <i>And no-one knows.</i>  Clearly, <i>someone</i> thought that it would be fun this time, <i>but it never actually turns out that way</i>.  Nobody even remembers planning the trip.  We all thought we were going to a beach up on the Florida panhandle.  But when we arrive, it&#x27;s actually Clearwater, near Orlando.  Every road we take, trying to get back to the beach, twists around like a Moebius strip, and ends up right back in the Disney World parking lot, under the monorails.<p>So we say to ourselves, &quot;Ok, we&#x27;ll just get one pineapple whip, and then we&#x27;ll leave, and try to get to the vacation we actually wanted.&quot;  Then we trudge up Main Street USA and hang a left, then another left, and another left, spending 20 minutes to go from the park entrance to the nearest place in the park that sells the cursed treats, when I know damned well that the employee utility corridors underneath us, on the first floor, are straight and efficient.  So we think, &quot;As long as we&#x27;re here, we might as well go on one of the rides, right?&quot;  And we get into line.  We get through that line, which leads to another queue.  And that takes us into a vestibule, where we see a short video with a group of other guests.  After it finishes, the doors open into another queuing labyrinth.  When we wait long enough to get through it, there&#x27;s just one more line, and after that, we&#x27;re on the actual ride.  We get into the ride vehicle, and sit through five minutes of something that may have been considered to be good, clean fun in the 60s, but is now disappointingly dated, racist, and sexist.  Afterward, we are deposited in the gift shop, which stands between us and the exit.  After escaping, now we need to pee, so that&#x27;s another unnecessarily long journey across the park and possibly more queuing.  By now, it would be too late to get to the beach before dark, so we just decide to finish out the day there.<p>Again, how the heck did we even get there in the first place?  Was it a Groupon?  Maybe a neighbor couldn&#x27;t use their vacation club passes this year?  We won the trip in a sweepstakes?  Booked by Satan&#x27;s own travel agency?  Nobody knows.  We just end up there, being milked of our hard earned cash, like cows with udders overfilled with silver nitrate solution.<p>Nobody actually wants to be there.

Nothing in the value chain is especially difficult to do or requires proprietary technology outside of the vehicular platform. The maps all pull data from open source databases like OSV, and logistics networks have been operating successfully for decades.<p>Regulation is going to be the thing holding everything back. I&#x27;m not talking about the disparate and protectionist taxi regulations that Uber just ignored until they were successful; I&#x27;m talking about real safety issues like air traffic control when everyone and their mother is flying things over populated areas. The regulatory environment around how all these drones will communicate needs to be developed and standardized -- that alone will take at least a decade because adequate bureaucracies need to be built up to develop, steward and enforce the regulations. Self-driving cars are even further off because they&#x27;re going to be carrying human passengers.<p>We&#x27;re at a point where the technology has overrun our ability to regulate it, and there really are things that need to be regulated -- Who is liable if two drones crash over your house and damage your roof? Do you force drone operators to carry insurance to cover damages in the event of mechanical failure? How do drones report their position to each other to avoid collisions? What data formats, units and auditing is required when communicating with other drones? There are thousands of questions, and none of them have even made it into the sphere of political discourse, much less legislative action. Current politicians don&#x27;t even understand this stuff, so we have to wait for people who do to become old enough to get elected.<p>I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re at least 15 years off from this future, if not 30. We&#x27;ll probably see it happen elsewhere in the world much sooner than it will in the US and Europe. So any business starting up today will not be able to rely on self-driving cars or autonomous delivery to prop up their business model: it has to work with human delivery or it won&#x27;t survive long enough to make it to the drone era.

It's the  percentage of users that contribute something that's interesting and there are a lot of ways to contribute.<p>Hitwise is also a third party without full access to the actual data for these sites. Their reports are definitely inaccurate, the question is just how inaccurate. Someone already pointed out they upload data with a downloadable client that would likely not be counted.

43542,comment,43449,43449,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I had a similar WTF moment when I read how Buffett was picking the new manager of Berkshire Hathaway.  It seems to go against everything he's taught in 30 years of letters from the chairman.  He's written <i>specifically</i> about how short-term incentives like this lead to poor performance over time.<p>It makes me wonder if there's something else at work.  Maybe Buffett plans to <i>watch</i> what the managers do with the money over 2 years, ignore the results, and pick the one whose actions best fit Buffett's investing style.  The ""contest"" aspect is to see how managers react to temptation - after all, they will face incentives like this every time they need to write Berkshire's annual reports.  Buffett wants something who will do the right thing even when the incentives are not aligned with it.  This way, he can weed out the ones that will prioritize short term gain over long term health when people ask for short term gain, and select only the ones that actually know what they're doing.",1187373349

No one wants to share their online backup account, but they might share or even sell their Anywhere.fm account. The legit use for the service is probably legally safe, but things can get gray quickly.<p>They should definitely requite all new uploads and store entirely separate copies of everyone's music. Doing optimization based on a file's checksum, like you'd do for a straight backup service, would be harder to explain to a judge.<p>They should very quickly implement a mechanism for locking accounts that get too many logins from different IP ranges in a short period of time. It shouldn't be too difficult to make it annoying for naughty users without impacting legit users. Staying on top of abuse and not letting their site get overrun like Veoh is key.",1187371098

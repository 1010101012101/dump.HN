The ability to choose your online sources of political information (e.g., Drudge Report vs. Huffington Post, etc.) would presumably trigger the same mechanism of action for polarization.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that, even if it&#x27;s true that deregulation originally contributed  to polarization, that&#x27;s not necessarily a strong argument for re-regulating these industries. Access to specialized content is an inevitable, technologically driven market trend, because people prefer experiences that are tailored to their tastes.<p>In a sense, the polarization we see may have been lurking within us all along, masked by the limited choices available for expressing political or cultural preferences when choosing which media content to intellectually consume.

If you look at some of the modern desktop applications they have feature creep. They include every bell, knob and whistle you can imagine and finding your way around is impossible. So I decided that the shell had reached its limits within the design constraints that it originally had. I said ‘you know there’s not a whole lot to more I can do and still maintain some consistency and simplicity’. The things that people did to it after that were make it POSIX compliant and no doubt there were other things that have been added over time.

At this extreme the land speed record seems rather arbitrary, because it&#x27;s (huge blundering oversimplification) a cart with wheels driving across a desert plain powered by a rocket - that doesn&#x27;t really relate to anything I can imagine being useful in cars in the real world.<p>When it comes down to it, I don&#x27;t really care whether the wheels are on the ground or not when the top speed is reached, because the fact that they are doesn&#x27;t seem to be meaningful in terms of what that means for improvements we&#x27;ll see in everyday car tech.<p>I&#x27;m probably wrong, knowing nothing about the engineering behind this, and there&#x27;s probably a ton of spin-off tech advancements for cars that are pushed forward by projects like this, aerodynamics for one.<p>Or maybe it&#x27;s just one of those &#x27;why did you climb the mountain? <i>because it&#x27;s there</i>&#x27; type projects where the end is the most important thing and some people will be excited by accomplishing the challenge, and others not so interested.",1443328177

The original definition seems still to have currency mostly among economists.<p>But the definition I gave is indeed the original one, and it is not a generalization. A tax may be progressive in your sense but not in the original sense: a luxury tax on yachts, for instance, is progressive in your sense, but not in the original sense if it is assessed at a fixed rate [0].<p>The OED&#x27;s first noted usage is way off, by the way; it is easy to verify that the term <i>progressive</i> in the context of taxation pre-dates the Progressive Era by at least a century. For instance, Thomas Paine proposed progressive taxes on estates (using the term numerous times) in his <i>Rights of Man</i> (1791). (He even drew up tables of suggested taxes, the rates of which rose with the value of the estate.) There are more commonplace examples from the first half of the nineteenth century that you can find on Google Books, including several that disambiguate the two senses in favor of the original definition I provided [1].<p>A great many of the early mentions of progressive taxes, including of those before the Progressive Era, do come in the course of discussing how to make taxation fairer (in the author&#x27;s view) or how to disperse inherited wealth. Since the rich own more wealth, buy more goods, and have greater incomes than the poor, progressive rates of taxation—in the original sense—tend to result in progressive taxes—in the other sense. I suppose the shift in meaning was to be expected.<p>0. Unless perhaps <i>yacht</i> is defined as an expensive boat. But the point stands: so long as there exist goods that the rich spend a higher proportion of their income on than do the poor, then a tax assessed at a fixed rate on those goods is progressive in your sense but not in the other.<p>1. There are also some examples, mostly in tables of import duties, where the terms <i>progressive</i> and <i>not progressive</i> are used in a sense that appears to distinguish duties that are assessed ad valorem versus those that are assessed as a flat fee; so it seems that <i>progressive</i> sometimes also meant merely that the <i>amount</i> of tax collected increased with the value subject to taxation, which is further distinct from our debate over progressive <i>rates</i>.",1443326510

Most of the newer software seemed to be written in .NET.<p>They have some really awesome tech, especially from an electronics point of view. Some of their newer MWD (measurement while drilling) tools have state of the art sensors for every physical phenomenon known to man. The drilling operator can therefore &quot;see&quot; everything. The electronics systems that go downhole can withstand insane temperatures (125C), shocks, and RPM.",1443326456

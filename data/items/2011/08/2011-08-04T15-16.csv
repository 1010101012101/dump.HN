If research was done that found that people would ignorantly use these tests in lieu of condoms, that would worsen the HIV epidemic considerably, and the FDA would likely not approve them for off the counter usage.<p>I'm libertarian minded, so my feelings about this are more complicated from that.

I spent a fair amount of time with Haskell and it certainly took a bit of time to get used to working with the type system (type inference is awesome, but it can also make for some mind-boggling errors).  In particular, I wondered if your Haskell programs Just Worked after you were able to get them to compile?<p>The payback for grappling with the type system is usually confidence that your program will run without silly errors (though you can still make silly errors (hello, cut-and-paste)).  I'm now spending a fair bit of time in Javascript/NodeJS and Python lands and I need lots of testing to make sure that my program won't experience some silly error sometime in the future (<- perhaps this means I'm not a good dev).",1312473483

The ""window period"" is the span of time between contracting the virus and the presence of detectable antibodies, which can be up to 6 months in some cases (though it's usually shorter). During this period, a person will test negative for HIV even though he or she is infected with the virus (and, worse, is contagious).<p>Newer tests have been developed that test for presence of the virus's RNA, shortening the window period to about 21 days (if I recall correctly), but they are more expensive and much, much less widespread.",1312471897

Those periods when I'm off schedule precipitate bursts of intense productivity (maybe I'm more rested; maybe I'm more motivated).<p><i>> I'm asking because I'm a morning person, but I doubt I would enjoy 'getting to it' at 5am everyday.</i><p>You nailed it with 'personal time' and a disinclination to work after work hours.

Any time I spend coding after work hours is time I can't spend with my wife and friends. That time is necessary for me as a human being, and for my work: socializing is good for my brain (promotion of neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis), and breaks are important (recharging and subconscious synthesis + assimilation).<p><i>> Do you all consider it part of your job to listen to what's happening in the tech world, learn about personal productivity, etc?

I do believe Google strongly believes in their ""Do not evil"" mantra but this particular one is all business. This is NOT the linux-ms battle again. Linux/GNU was more like a movement without a business/monetary aspirations behind it. Redhat and others sprung around the ecosystem as service providers later on. Android is started/released by a business to make money. So MS is dealing with a different beast here. Google cannot think it would get away by giving their software for free. Nothing is free.

I've been involved in HIV education as part of the gay community, and this sort of kit worries me greatly. If the test is an antibody based test, then it could do far more harm than good by giving uneducated users a false sense of security: a negative result does <i>not</i> mean that you don't have HIV.<p>While I'm sure that everyone on HN understands the seroconversion window period, this is simply not the case in the larger community. Ignorance about HIV is widespread. I cannot even begin to count the number of people who believe that pulling out before ejaculating affords some sort of magical protection from the virus. These are the same people who upon seeing a negative result would assume that they're safe without condoms.<p>The CDC states that the window period for detectable HIV antibody formation is three months; however, this figure is based on first generation HIV tests and is considered somewhat conservative. Public health experts like H. Hunter Handsfield state that detectable antibodies usually form in four to six weeks.<p>Whatever figure you choose to believe, it's a pretty significant time period. And it's a <i>deadly</i> one. It's during the window period that an HIV infected person is most infectious. Their viral loads are off the chart and they can unknowingly infect multiple people in a short period of time.<p>The ""cure"" for HIV is the same as it has always been: education and safer sex practices. HIV is largely a preventable disease. I would be okay with personal test kits if they were bundled with extremely clear educational packets printed in multiple languages. But this particular kit is advertised too much like a silver bullet to assure me that the manufacturers are anywhere near that responsible.",1312471130

I mean what I say.<p>> Are you a techie? Do you understand the web? Who would you want writing legislation to govern the web? Lawyers who are clueless about the web and think that the internet is a series of tubes, or people that are VERY web savvy - like Tim Berners-Lee, et. al? The same thing applies to finance, banking and everything else. Makes no sense to have people writing legislation or creating systems that don't understand what they are doing.<p>The tech equivalent of the Fed would be if the techies designed an internet where 1) all information goes through some central servers that they control, 2) they sell that information and profit, 3) everyone is legally required to use their internet and not a competing internet for sending information over long distances. This would be a corrupt, Fed-like version of the internet where some particular group of people have all the power and use it for their own benefit. This analogy isn't perfect, but it captures the basic point, that the Fed was designed in a corrupt way. It doesn't matter that the corrupt people were experts or not. If anything, being experts and using expert-jargon just allowed them to mislead everyone about the true purpose of their design - socialism for the rich.<p>For more of this type of information on the Fed, read ""End the Fed"" by Ron Paul and ""The Case Against the Fed"" by Murray Rothbard.<p>> If that's the case, why has inflation been so low in the US in the last two years, when the Fed undertook the largest expansion of it's balance sheet in modern history? i.e. it has printed more money recently, than at any other time in it's mandate - but inflation AND inflation expectations are still low.<p>The Fed publishes misleading inflation numbers. Anyone who spends a lot of their income on things like food and energy recognizes that prices are rising pretty quickly. For me one price that stands out is that a cup of coffee used to cost less than $2 a few years ago, but now costs something like $2.30. It stands out because paying $2 and receiving a nickle as change is a lot more convenient than paying $3 and receiving $0.70 as change.<p>However, I agree that inflation is not as high as I would expect given just how much money the Fed has printed. I'm not exactly sure where the new money has gone, but it is probably just sitting around in some bank accounts somewhere, not circulating in the economy, and that's why we haven't felt it more than we have. I suppose it is probably being used by banks to patch up their balance sheets after the crisis and that's why it is just sitting there. My bet would be that in the coming years, that money will get used, and that's when we will really start to feel the inflation. When coffee reaches $5 per cup, we will know QE1 and QE2, etc., have trickled down.",1312470912

According to TFA, Javascript blocks the UI thread in IE9.<p>Their own guidelines that they link to [1] says ""Do not: call into any 'unknown' code from your UI thread"".  I don't see why a browser is special and can't keep to that rule - especially a modern browser like IE9.<p>[1] <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744765(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744765(v=vs.85).as...</a>",1312470328

However, you yourself become infectious from a couple of days after infection, and in fact there's often a really high viral load in these early few weeks/months before antibodies start being produced.<p>Long story short, for the 2-6 months after you first become infected the test would return negative, but you'd still be highly infectious.",1312470277

What we really need to know is what their customer churn is - what percentage of merchants use the service again? What percentage of consumers use the service again?<p>If their churn is very low, the adjusted CSOI numbers are interesting to look at (once acquired, customers stick around for awhile and have a positive lifetime value). If their churn is very high, welcome back to the 2001 bubble. The fundamental question about a business at this scale isn't so much whether they are making or losing money, but whether anyone actually wants what they're selling (at a price higher than what it costs to deliver). It really isn't rocket surgery.<p>Or their business model is to sell irrational exuberance and cash out before anyone notices. That's also a viable business model.",1312470189

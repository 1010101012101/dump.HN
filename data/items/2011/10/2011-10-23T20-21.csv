The rotating deegr explanation banners at the top mention something about ""refine your search after rating a few movies"", and shows an icon for that, but I don't see that icon anywhere in the interface.

Classics may be interesting and even entertaining, but people always find they are not like books used for diversion, which give up all of their content at once - the classics seem to grow wiser as we grow wiser, more useful the more we use them."" - Thomas Cleary",1319400687

The fact that I can start rating right off the front page is equally good.<p>* I don't grok how the right side ""Recommendation Summary"" widget works. I rate stuff and they... disappear? Wait, aren't these supposed to be recommendations in the first place? So where are the ratings (starts)? Also, what's the relation between this widget and the content to the left (my ""circle"")?<p>* To the left, I'm seeing some dude's ratings. Maybe you should change the graphics for dude's ratings and my ratings? Because both are in blue.<p>* As I mention I already use several recommendation engines. I would really love to submit my Criticker profile page and have the ratings imported. Because you know I have spent hours rating stuff over the course of several years.<p>* I don't see the purpose of ""You both rated : (20)"" In the left content pane. Also, it takes up a lot of visual space.<p>* This is pretty fun to use.<p>* Some of the UI - sub-items of the Movies tab; the hover for the Register link - are still in French.<p>* I've seen most of the recs I'm getting.

However, we have to recognize that the concept of experimenting with an MVP is completely foreign to many entrepreneurs, and even among those who know about and pay lip service to it, they very frequently can't commit to it in practice. I've seen this issue come up time and time with both new and seasoned, successful entrepreneurs. They think they know what customers want and cling to unproven notions irrationally. They get hyper focused on unnecessary features. They delay launches over fear of launching with an ""imperfect"" product, and also don't recognize that their vision of perfection is unproven and frequently flawed.<p>In fact, as a developer, this issues have come up in <i>every</i> project in which I've paired with a less-than-technical stakeholder. As someone who has been very active in startup communities, my observation has been that the tendencies the book intends to fight are rampant among non-technical founders.<p>I'm happy this book exists, because it's finally an easily digestible introduction to some baseline concepts that many entrepreneurs have a difficult time understanding and putting into practice.",1319400322

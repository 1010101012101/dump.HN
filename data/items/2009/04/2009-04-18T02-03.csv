You can look in their faces, they’re longshoremen, and they have this confidence about them...I’ve seen a lot of guys with millions and they don’t have any confidence,” he says. “So they’re not wealthy.”",1240023226

My estimation of self-worth comes instead from my research, my projects, and my work. It's an arbitrary preference, much as it's arbitrary for some people to feel completed by a union with someone else.<p>I'm smart, I'm driven, and I'm incredibly picky when it comes to the people I socialize with. Life is short, and just like everyone else does I make personal value judgments as to how best spend what little time I have.

I tried to source it as much as possible, but at the end of the day, we'll simply have to agree to disagree.<p>If you Google how the civil war started, you get everything from Dred Scott to John C. Calhoun. Last year we visited the Lincoln museum in Springfield, IL. I bought a book there -- something like ""50 things that could have prevented the Civil War"" It was an interesting read, speculative at best (as all of these types of conversations go)<p>I would argue that all of the presidents in my list are ""pretty good"" In fact, they're great presidents. But that doesn't mean that they don't fall short at the bar of history. Most of them made excellent tactical decisions that had long-term consequences. You can't blame presidents for being human, and humans do the best they can.<p>It's a complicated subject -- hence the post. Thanks for giving it a read.",1240020611

567946,comment,565528,567089,0,0,codeodor,,,"It's a good question, but I'd have to say: only if you equate ""nonstandard"" with ""considered harmful.""<p>Needless to say, I don't.<p>For one, there is a large difference between the spaghetti code that can result from liberal and 
injudicious goto usage vs. whatever you might encounter by using ""for"" instead of "".each""<p>In the goto case - we use it all the time under different names with special circumstances: method calls, loops, breaks, nexts, etc.<p>In the case of for vs. each - it depends. In some cases you may indeed be iterating over the contents of some object in particular. But what if you are iterating over the contents of two disparate objects? Should we use "".each"" on one and keep a separate counter for the other?<p>And then, there are those times when you actually want the variables in the loop to be available outside the scope of the loop, as I mentioned in the previous comment. It might not be standard, but it does happen. One instance is where you are letting doing evals on variables introduced by the objects in the loop. That just can't happen with the .each call, and you need the ""for"" loop to do it.<p>And I would add, even if it were possible to keep track of that in a block we pass to #each, I would rather not do so because of the psychological implications of doing so. If I want to iterate over two disparate objects, I need a way of expressing that, and the ""for"" loop is it.",1240020222

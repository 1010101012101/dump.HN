2936951,comment,2936096,2936096,7,0,pilif,,,"When I started with PHP3 development in 1998, PostgreSQL was still called Postgres95 and it had some severe limitations which were directly adverse to the features needed for web development:<p>1) performance was very slow<p>2) There was an effective row size limit of 8K over the whole row which worked against people who wrote forum software (big posts) or were (ugh) storing binaries in the database.<p>3) Even today, PostgreSQL requires a bit more maintenance and configuration until it works right, whereas MySQL ran out of the box. Back then, VACUUM wasn't at all optional and still required an exclusive lock over the tables it was working on.<p>4) There was a misconception that each Postgres user needed to be a Unix system user (this might or might not be true. Probably isn't, but I and others were certainly thinking that), so it was working against the usual cheap virtual hosting.<p>5) The MySQL extension for PHP was much more advanced than the postgres one, leading to people preferring MySQL which in the end lead to the virtual hosts only installing MySQL at which point Postgres' fate was sealed.<p>6) MySQL was coined as a spiritual successor to mSQL (just look at the names), which was very popular at the time as it was the first SQL-database for ""normal people"". You either did flat-files or mSQL.<p>7) MySQL had Windows support from the beginning. Postgres95 was still using cygwin (if you could get it to work). Back then, many people were using Windows as their development environment and being able to run the whole stack on your development machine does have some advantages.<p>By now, aside of the maintenance thing, Postgres has lost all these drawbacks, but now it's too late as people are using what they know is working for them, so they are just going with MySQL (or SQLite if they need more simplicity, which is interesting in itself as MySQL for <i>ages</i> provided an embedded linkable and serverless variant which also never took on).",1314622258

But the alien doesn't understand the direction. So Feynman says:<p>""Listen, build yourself a magnet, and put the coils in, and put the\ncurrent on, and then take some cobalt and lower the temperature.\nArrange the experiment so the electrons go from the foot to the\nhead, then the direction in which the current goes through the coils\nis the direction that goes in on what we call the right and comes\nout on the left.""<p>For anyone who doesn't get the wrong hand joke, the physical reason to watch out is: ""matter to the right is symmetrical with antimatter to the left.""",1314622091

2936937,comment,2935944,2936168,9,0,redthrowaway,,,"As you allude to, the problem with direct democracy is that people are stupid.  Not all people about all things, but most people about most things.  The realm of human knowledge is simply too vast for anyone to have a broad command of, so we specialize.  This means that, for any given issue, the vast majority of people are ignorant about its specifics.  Thus we cannot expect the masses to make wise decisions about most issues.  The obvious counter-argument to this is education, that educating the public on the issues at hand would lead to better decisions.  However, that would fall victim to the same demagoguery and corruption that we see infecting politics today.<p>By way of illustration, think of an issue that you care deeply about and are well-informed on.  Now ask yourself if you would trust the public at large to make policy on it.  For every pg, grellas, or Schneier, you'll have far more popular Becks, Palins, and Bachmanns.

While infinite games have no winners, have no end, and the goals are often framed around ensuring that the game never ends.<p>It's easy to think of finite games in our lives, they are everywhere in our society, and the OP does a good job of pointing out some of the less obvious cases.

It is about the transition from revolution to institution. Centralisation limits the disruptive potential of the Internet and in the long term will transform it from an enabling technology into another obstacle that needs to be overcome.<p>This is just another step in a long series of advancements that have transformed human existence: organised Agriculture, Centralised Government, The Written Word, The Legal System, Mathematics, Science, Democracy, Free Markets, Finance, The Industrial Revolution, Publishing, Education, Modern Medicine, Personal Automobiles, and the Mass Media. In the idealistic minds of the pioneers, the potential was evident and intentions often subversive. Today these have invariably matured into terribly inefficient monstrous empires that are fiercely resistant to innovation or new ideas. With the resources to move the world, why should they move for anyone?<p>Personal Computing and the Internet are new and exciting, the gatekeepers remain engineers because they are the only ones that seem to be able to get it to do anything. Despite the convenience argument, building a centralised infrastructure will lead to the inevitable takeover by the same maniacs that run everything else. Of course, it may take a few generations before Google's superbly engineered infrastructure is operated by a Manufacturing/Pharmaceutical/Petroleum/Media/Retail/Finance/Defense conglomerate whose alumni occupy every significant position in Government. Why should we bother?<p>""After this, let's build the biggest, most bad-ass super robot weapon ever because it's cool and fun, we'll use a master password because it's more convenient and surely that bully that eats all our lunches might be watching intently, but he's too stupid to understand advanced control theory.""<p>That being said, I would like to work at Google, the smart kids building the biggest, most bad-ass super robot weapon ever.",1314621194

The answer is refactoring: taking the principles and patterns that work, streamlining them, ditching the cruft that works for a few edge cases but mostly gets in the way, simplifying the underlying metaphor of the system, and re-asssembling.<p>The only way to do this with much larger systems, such as systems of governance, is revolution or exploring new lands. Personally I'm a bit concerned about revolution -- the assumption with refactoring is that the people refactoring understand what the ""good"" parts are and what the ""bad"" parts are. They also need to be able to generalize and simplify in order to keep the system cognitively approachable. In my experience, it's very easy to be angry-tear-down-the-system guy, very difficult to actually refactor. As the author points out, it's not that these systems are entirely useless. The hell of the thing is that the reasons for creating these systems are still very valid.<p>I remain convinced that programmers (hackers) have a lot to add to the discussion when talking about complex, brittle systems.

In part because it lets me kill a parent tab along with all children, but without affecting anything else, with a few clicks. It also lets me drag a whole thread of tabs to a new window or bookmark it etc. etc. Finally, having a vertical tab list makes efficient use of wide-screen displays and you can still read useful amounts of the page title even with 25+ tabs.<p>Oh and here's another one that might be even more useful to you, with your emphasis on the browser history: <i>Tab History Redux</i>[2].

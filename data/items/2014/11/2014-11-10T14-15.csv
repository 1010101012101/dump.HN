In the vast majority of cases, money leads to less misery.  Then you just lead your life without the obsessive material thoughts so many struggle with.<p>I do agree with your last point, though, that once you reach a certain level of stability, you should focus on either reducing other people&#x27;s misery if you have the power to do so or creating things (either yourself or by proxy) that wouldn&#x27;t exist in the world without your help.",1415631527

8583780,comment,8580025,8580467,0,0,rbehrends,,,"The summary is misleading. The person in question is Andrej Holm; the word matching algorithm did not directly lead to the search of his home and his arrest. It led to an investigation (in conjunction with his known extremist leanings); the warrants for the search and the arrest were based on his meetings and mail exchanges with the suspect in an arson case [1] (that suspect was later convicted of attempted arson and membership in a criminal organization).<p>That said, while there was plenty of probable cause to justify a search warrant [2] (as far as I can tell), the arrest warrant was all kinds of questionable, even considering the additional incriminating evidence that was found as the result of the search [3]. As the Federal Court of Justice noted when they vacated the arrest warrant [1], all the prosecution could prove was him having connections with the extreme left, but no evidence that he was involved in terrorist activities. And having extreme left sympathies and writing extreme left articles may be criminally stupid, but it&#x27;s not a crime.<p>With regard to &quot;bursting into their Berlin home&quot;, the article also does not mention that Holm had been a member of the &quot;Wachregiment Feliks Dzierzynski&quot; [4], an elite paramilitary regiment under the command of the Stasi. Together with Holm&#x27;s undoubted connections with the extreme left, law enforcement could be excused for assuming that he may be dangerous.<p>The real concern is that the prosecution kept pushing even when it became increasingly clear that they caught the wrong guy (along with the actual perpetrators); thankfully, the courts would have none of it (this time).<p>[1] <a href=""http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&nr=41487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/doc...</a> (judgement vacating the arrest warrant against Andrej Holm, in German)<p>[2] Strictly speaking, German criminal procedure law has different requirements for searches compared to US law, but there&#x27;s a &quot;probable cause&quot;-like element, and from the looks of it, the prosecution would have had probable cause under the US standard, too.<p>[3] The standard for an arrest warrant is &quot;dringender Tatverdacht&quot;, meaning that the suspect is very likely to be the perpetrator, based upon available evidence; it&#x27;s a higher standard than what is necessary to prosecute, which requires only that a conviction is likely, not very likely. An additional requirement for an arrest warrant is that the suspect is either (1) likely to flee or to (2) engage in obstruction of justice or (3) has been previously convicted of serious crimes and there is substantive evidence that he or she may commit other serious crimes.<p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Dzerzhinsky_Guards_Regiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Dzerzhinsky_Guards_Regime...</a>",1415631250

8583747,comment,8583257,8583257,0,0,callahad,,,"Hi! Just a heads up that folks from the dev tools team will be monitoring this thread and are on-hand to answer questions. We&#x27;ll try not to thread sit too much. :) In brief, the Developer Edition is a new release channel for Firefox, replacing Aurora (our pre-Beta channel). Everything else about the release cadence is the same.<p>There are four major new features here:<p>1. The Firefox Tools Adapter (&quot;Valence&quot;), which lets you use the Firefox dev tools to inspect and debug pages in Chrome for Android and Safari for iOS. The goal: one set of tools to debug any browser.<p>2. Side-by-side profiles. The Developer Edition defaults to a profile named `dev-edition-default`, which makes it easier to run Developer Edition at the same time as a normal release version of Firefox. You don&#x27;t have to deal with the profile switcher each time.<p>3. Developer-friendly defaults. Developer Edition ships with things like remote debugging and browser-chrome debugging enabled by default.<p>4. And, for all of you who hated Australis, a compact theme with square tabs.<p>But those are just consequences of the single biggest change:<p>5. We have a new channel, which new rules. And we want to use it to build the best possible browser for web developers. We can ship new tools that aren&#x27;t yet ready for the Beta channel, and we can change the browser&#x27;s appearance and defaults specifically for web developers.<p>We&#x27;ll be watching this thread during launch, but you can always submit feature requests on UserVoice.

For all lifes clothing decisions, better to be over, than under dressed
2 Ask a recruiter whats appropriate, if you are dealing with one.
3 Whatever you wear, make sure it looks nice (no stains, ironed, fits well,etc)<p>How someone is dressed is a very small part of hiring (in the tech world, less so for other professions), but it does speak to attention to detail, and how they see themselves.

The following is the easy, non-iterative process:<p>(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)

His work has been cited in congressional testimony, the study in question -- the one he just admitted suppressing data on -- a major tool used against claims of those who for years have publicly stated their children developed autism after vaccination.<p>Given what the Snopes article <i>does</i> admit however, their conclusion seems odd.  One must wonder what proposition their &quot;FALSE&quot; rating attains to, because it clearly isn&#x27;t:<p>Thompson&#x27;s own statement qualifies him as a whistle-blower who admits to suppressing significant data on the vacine-autism link.<p>Snopes does, however, appears to <i>agree</i> with these 2 points:<p>a) A phone call was recorded without Thompson&#x27;s knowledge, after which he lawyered up.<p>b) Shortly after that, Thompson issued a press release with the following admission: &quot;I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.&quot;<p>What do you think &quot;statistically significant&quot; means?  It seems obvious that if Thopmson could have stated something like &quot;the data my team deleted would not have changed the outcome or validity of this research&quot;... that he <i>definitely</i> would have... wouldn&#x27;t he act in his own best interest to control the damage?  That he did not make such a claim in his confession, and that it implicates the whole team, is palpable.  One would be naive not to suspect that the suppressed data set must be discoverable at this point.<p>So... Snopes reprints what is fact a <i>direct confession</i> of precisely what the vaccine skeptics have been saying.  That is an objective fact.  By definition Thompson is a CDC whistle-blower who has admitted grievous scientific fraud on key research -- unless you think he is a delusional nut, which would raise other interesting questions about CDC.<p>If he were just being misquoted by a vaccine nut, as implied by Snopes, wouldn&#x27;t CDC<p>i) back him up, and<p>ii) provide any legal protection needed for him on their own dime?<p>iii) coordinate any media response.<p>Because that&#x27;s <i>not</i> what has happened.  At all.  Instead, after the recording was exposed Thompson issued a press release making his personal role in scientific misconduct even more clear, and he got <i>his own</i> lawyers.  Are you naive jonnathanson, or what can you say to explain this?  If a nut twisted your own work, would you then schedule a press release admitting fraud in clear terms, making it clear you weren&#x27;t along while you were at it?  Obviously his hand was forced on this, and he now sees a conflict between his own interests and CDC&#x27;s.<p>CNN could easily verify everything I just said... e.g. the statement is posted on Thompson&#x27;s lawyer&#x27;s website.  That would be why they reposted it, obviously... if the press release with Thompson&#x27;s stunning admission hadn&#x27;t been real, they would not have done so.  Surely you don&#x27;t equate some disclaimers about ultimate science -- which should not be decided on this story alone -- with the idea that Thompson&#x27;s revelation is unimportant?  This should be more widely covered... and I&#x27;d have to bet we&#x27;ll see more on it.<p>Summary: Snopes doesn&#x27;t deny <i>at all</i> that a high-level whistle-blower just admitted tainting one of the key studies used to &quot;debunk&quot; the vaccine-autism link.  The site confirms that, then goes on to reiterate the PC position that the vaccine-autism link doesn&#x27;t exist.  Well, if you look at Snopes as a whole they clearly have a position on the science, but none of what has been said here is sufficient reason to ignore the very real Thompson incident.<p>Snopes also does <i>not</i> use the word &quot;hoax&quot; -- jonnathanson does.  So, jonnathanson, beyond an apparent need to soothe yourself/others by quickly Googling something that says &quot;FALSE&quot; in big letters, can you respond to the <i>specific</i> points above?  Particularly why you think Thompson felt the need to double down on his confession and get his own legal team after the recording surfaced?  Surely he isn&#x27;t part of the &quot;hoax&quot; (conspiracy?) you envision on the anti-vaccine side?",1415628170

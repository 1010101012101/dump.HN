It&#x27;s possible that early  scientific staff (part of the huge turnover commented elsewhere) weren&#x27;t happy with that tolerance.<p>Now they are in the process of getting FDA approved. At the same time Theranos is also following a Silicon Valley strategy, building an audience with a loss leading product. In this case it&#x27;s doing blood tests at a price well below cost, using normal lab equipment, and covering the difference with VC money.<p>They dont want to admit this for two reasons<p>1) It exposes them to the competition, who know they are losing money on every transaction and it also would make doctors and patients wary of dealing with them<p>2) As discussed in the WSJ article taking less blood and using normal machines just means a less accurate blood test, which makes the benefit of not getting a needle much smaller and messes with their core marketing message<p>I think this also explains the directive discussed in WSJ to only submit sample results from normal lab equipment, as at the moment they are simply operating as a normal lab.<p>I think this is a clash between staff who think Theranos was all about creating a reliable way of doing blood tests with less blood, and the current direction they are taking building scale with traditional equipment.",1445079269

Part of the problem is the clientele: data scraping jobs are the shadiest, worst-paid jobs you can take on as a programmer. Also, offering the client to pay what they think is fair is a monumentally bad idea.<p>The bigger problem is the perception of value. I regularly get requests for doing insane amounts of work (usually it involves cloning a multi-million dollar site or app) for less than I charge for a single day. There are &quot;idea people&quot; out there, who think the goal to success is paying someone 300 bucks to implement a clone of the Android app store. It&#x27;s a real example by the way. I mainly get my work through the <i>Who Is Hiring</i> thread on HN, and although the overall client quality has been high, it&#x27;s unavoidable that over half of all requests are absolute bogus.<p>I suspect I&#x27;m not the only one having this experience. Now, these inquiries can be effortlessly ignored (I usually do answer them back with or without a short statement why I&#x27;m not taking the job) - however, if <i>you&#x27;re just scraping by</i>, these &quot;gigs&quot; can totally demoralize you.<p>To an average person, programming is not a valuable thing, and they do not view it as skilled labour. This has been the case for as long as I can remember. After high school, twenty years ago, a friend and I got into freelancing. A lot of inquiries were pretty much the same as they are now. My friend used to say we should rebrand ourselves as the Web Sherpas, named after the local people who often get hired for grating or dangerous work on behalf of tourists yet receive little compensation for it.<p>To the freelancer just starting out I say: don&#x27;t get suckered into these kinds of debates, be friendly but firm in rejecting malicious &quot;job offers&quot;. Holding out until the right client comes along can be tough, and you&#x27;re going to need a financial buffer to do this. But it&#x27;s definitely the only way to go. People taking $15/hour data scraping jobs are part of the problem because they help distort the value perception of our profession (plus they help making the internet a worse place).

People work either: (1) they want money, and/or (2) they want something to do during their waking hours.<p>Even if I had enough money that I never had to work the rest of my life, I still would definitely work, because I enjoy work, and want to do something meaningful (from my perspective) with my life. I would most likely be a pro bono computer science researcher, and might maybe join a PhD program -- if I get to pick what I research on, which might be possible since I don&#x27;t need grant money, and would cost the school zilch.<p>But basically, my point is that what motivates me (and most people) to work is either: (1) the love of work, or (2) the need for money.<p>Absolutely not greed and fear, as you say.<p>Now with regard to communist societies, I think the biggest problem is the utter lack of freedom. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but I have a strong feeling that the epic failure of communist economies like the Soviet Union or pre-1990 India could be directly attributable to heavy regulation of businesses. They made it hard to start and run a business.<p>Now I&#x27;m sure over 90% people will never start register a company in their lives (maybe that percentage is reducing now), but making it hard for 10% that do start & run businesses could be the direct cause for the failure of these large economies. For example, India, until 1990 followed Soviet Union-inspired policies, and one of the biggest consequences of this was insane red tape know as &quot;License Raj&quot;[1] wherein you couldn&#x27;t start a business without approval from a dozen corrupt government agencies, and even if you did succeed in starting one, you were subject to an overwhelming number of regulations that made it insanely hard for you to run your business.<p>Why do I think making it hard for 10% to run business is the cause of their economic failure? Because it prevented any sort of free market capitalistic competition. Everything was run by a bunch of non-business-minded bureaucrats who predictably did a bad job at it. Restricting private businesses and especially competition prevented an increase in production efficiency, and made the economy as a whole less efficient. A lot of these factors and other factors rolled in to one, led to the hour long lines for milk and butter.<p>More fundamentally, regulations erodes away <i>your</i> freedom. If you want to do something -- and starting a business or selling something is doing something -- if the government steps in and says &quot;no you can&#x27;t do that without my approval&quot; that is an insane Mafia-protection-racket-esque interference in <i>your personal freedom</i>. You&#x27;re just trying to make something and sell it! Nothing wrong with that! People have been doing this for millennia! Why do I need to listen to you, follow your little rules, or pay you a fee, to exercise my personal freedom?<p>Regulations take away freedom. And enough of it destroys economies.

10403944,comment,10398549,10398549,0,0,veddox,,,"We have to distinguish between Internet access for people in the cities and people in rural areas.<p>The benefits for people in the cities are definitely there: better communication, higher flow of information, more possibilities.<p>The benefits for people in the bush are, as far as I can see, virtually zero. Giving &quot;free Internet to all those poor people in some African village&quot; may sound great to a Western audience, but to me it signifies an utter misunderstanding of rural Africa.<p>In the West, the Internet has brought on a social and economic revolution, with much changing for the better. But to think that simply giving African villagers free Internet would bring them the same benefits is utterly misguided (at least as things stand at the moment). Here&#x27;s why:<p>1) Electricity: smart phones need a lot of electricity. How do you get that into places that aren&#x27;t hooked up to the grid? First you would need a program to distribute solar cells or something of the sort to provide the necessary power. (Note that I think this in itself would be a much more laudable goal than free Internet - you can do a lot more with electricity than you can with access to the Internet.)<p>2) Hardware: You need to get those smart phones into the village in the first place, and once they are there, keep them in working order. (Despite extreme heat, dust everywhere, and a host of other technophobe conditions.) Note however that many villagers do in fact own a cell phone by now, although they tend to be good old-fashioned, cheap and durable Nokias.<p>3) Education: many, if not most villagers are illiterate. The Internet is a text-based medium. If you really want them to benefit from the Internet, fix the education systems in their countries first.<p>4) Language: most villagers do not speak English/French/Portuguese fluently. The percentage of sites in a language they understand (if they can read) is infinitesimally small. Therefore, the actual benefit they have from Internet access is much reduced.<p>5) Oral tradition: Almost all of Africa has an oral tradition, not a written one like the West. This means that there simply is no culture of writing things. Very few books are being written in Africa, the number of magazines appearing in any given native language range from zero to perhaps five. This partly has to do with the aforementioned lack of education, but a lot of it is really a cultural artefact. Again, the Internet is a text-based medium that includes very few sites in local languages. And if (almost) no one is going to write new sites, that is going to stay that way for the foreseeable future.<p>6) Programming?: Some people suggest that given free Internet, the villagers could teach themselves programming to earn a living. This is ludicrous. Even for those who can read and write, many have never even seen a computer, let alone have the funds to buy one. And how are they going to get paid if they (as is usually the case) don&#x27;t have a bank account, and the nearest bank is 200km away?<p>7) National service providers: the last point is an economic one. Despite what people in Europe and America may think, there is actually Internet available in large parts of Africa. Local service providers are expensive, unreliable and often incredibly slow (we used to be glad to get a 5kb/s connection). But they are local. If some big company from the West pushes in with an offer of free Internet for all, the national economy is going to suffer for it. (It&#x27;s happened before with the clothing industry in Tanzania, that was all but destroyed by western &quot;charity clothes&quot;.)<p>I have lived most of my life in Africa, I love the continent and its people. Of course I want them to develop their countries further. But seriously, giving free Internet to villagers is just about the dumbest thing you could do right now. Yes, eventually they should get good Internet, absolutely. But that is problem #241 on the list, and we&#x27;re still working on problems #25 through to #43. Let&#x27;s fix the education and health systems first; help them develop good agricultural techniques and fight corruption; build up solid infrastructures for transport and electricity, or any other of the myriad of things that they need, URGENTLY.",1445076509

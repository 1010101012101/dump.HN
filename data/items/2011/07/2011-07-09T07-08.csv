I have an extremely noisy neighbour that I presume is from India or Pakistan. He shouts at his wife nearly all day - everyday and stops me coding because it's so god-dam annoying. His big booming voice is waking me up early too after coding until 3am. Do I confront him or drop an anonymous letter through his door? I don't want to create a war with my neighbour as it could lead to years of misery, although I have to say I'm pretty tired and miserable now. I need a quiet environment to work and this is killing me - perhaps my fellow hackers can help out.",1310198353

However, most people are very unlikely to kill anybody, ever, and would rather die than kill somebody in self-defense. (See <i>On Killing</i>.) By the numbers, Torontonians are substantially less likely to be cold-blooded killers than the average person.<p>Now, we had a mafioso living in the apartment downstairs from us for several months, with a couple of warrants out for his arrest.  Good buddy with the police who patrol our street.  Real friendly guy.  Name was Teddy (yes, I know that's not a Spanish name).  Stole all the landlord's furniture from the apartment, even the refrigerator.  I don't remember what the warrants were for, but there's a substantial chance that he <i>was</i> a cold-blooded killer.  But if he'd been on the other side of that table, I still don't think he'd be very likely to try to maintain possession of the stolen laptop by killing you.  I'm sure he'd do his best to intimidate the living fuck out of you, maybe threaten to call the police himself, but I don't think he takes violence so lightly that he would stab you with a Starbucks knife in order to keep the laptop.",1310195144

The Shuttle is so incredibly ill-suited for that task that I'd wager the ISS would make a better escape vehicle from the Shuttle than the other way around.<p>Soyuz crafts on the other hand are bloody brilliant at the job.

In all discussions on this subject, the comparison to physical keys comes up and the trivial conclusion is that passwords are not protected under the 5th amendment. If combinations to wall safes <i>are</i> protected by the 5th, I'd say the situation is clear cut: a password is <i>exactly like</i> the combination to a safe. You'd have to give up physical tokens required to login/boot a device, but not the subsequent password.<p>This interpretation is strengthened vastly by the fact that the EFF is arguing this case.

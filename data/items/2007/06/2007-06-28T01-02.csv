He has a big idea for a web application, $50,000, and the application designed in adobe illustrator.  He does not have a technical background or a co-founder[s].  WHAT SHOULD HE DO? ",1182995879

Slashdot is 10 years old so you can create a business from <i>'(tech) news aggregation'</i>.  <p><i>""...

Could the solution to this be trying to stay to the <i>low-amplitude</i> end of the long tail ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail</a> ) of possible submissions (<i>finding, encouraging posts from obscure original articles, posts</i>) and trying to avoid the popular aggregated posts or <i>high-amplitude</i> (<i>mainstream media searches for stories, add a bit of commentary + add</i>) you see in the mainstream?<p>The real value for readers (<i>in my opinion</i>) is in the access to <i>variety</i> of information. Low amplitude is equals greater diversity of information. ",1182995720

And there's no documentation to the point of seeming intentional ...""</i><p>Python documentation is on my continuous reading list & is one of the pluses for python usage. But lack of it hasn't stopped Rails adoption. Why? Is it that Rails is that simple to use (for experienced developers)? ",1182994645

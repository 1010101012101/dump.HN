To me, the real value (or potential value) of this site lays in the discussions centering around the links, rather than the links themselves, so I'll probably be using this as the default view from now on.<p>Might be an idea to make this view contribute 25% to the ranking of the main view as well? Quite a few decent discussions with few votes have popped up, so it might be a good idea. ",1174467543

5335,comment,5307,5307,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Well, maybe you could let your users answer that one for you by putting an SDK page up with 'coming soon - email us for a beta test' and tracking hits/emails. You'll probably change so much after launch that you don't want to be stuck trying to support API 1.0 so unless you get a lot of requests for it , it's probably a bad idea.",1174467359
5334,comment,5251,5327,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Well Google can always put unproven sites on the backburner, sending them very little traffic. 10,000 clicks to sell a Merc is a good point, though, it would take forever. Maybe they could do a backburner system but you can pay to jump the queue? Almost defeats the purpose.",1174466909

5331,comment,5251,5292,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Actually, it can work on the same principle as PPC, except the $/click takes time to work out (you have to send traffic to the site to determine how much revenue it gets you). Analagous to your example is Amazon biding $0.00001 per click - they would simply be outbid by sites willing to pay more for the keywords. The only difference is that with PPC there's a minimum - I think it's 5 cents, though it might have increased to 10 - but you can define an action as an extremely infrequent event. But that difference only comes into play when you've got no competition, and if you've got no competition for a keyword, it's extremely unlikely that it's going to be a lucrative one.<p>The key point is that Google figures out how much it makes by sending people to a site, and ranks the sites based on that metric. So just like Adwords, there's no getting around the fact that paying Google more (by bidding higher, or on more frequent events) will get you better placement, and therefore more traffic.",1174466593
5330,comment,5314,5314,0,0,danielha,,,"It is unsurprisingly compelling. But the live chat and interactivity really made it for me. It's great to just idle in the room all day, pop back on the computer after some time and ask ""So what'd I miss?""<p>The potential of justin.tv is just phenomenal right now. The platform that they've built is really going to change how entertainment is done.",1174466471
5329,comment,5328,5328,0,0,rms,,,"No one does Y Combinator style funding for biotech because startup costs are so much higher than for Web 2.0. My biotech company is more like a Web 2.0 startup because I could take a company to profitability on $25,000.<p>I've applied to the local biotech incubator. Anyone have any other ideas for getting funding and mentoring? Do small business loans to buy capital hold the individual accountable for repayment?",1174465072

5327,comment,5251,5251,0,0,zaidf,,,"This is going to be a tough nut to crack.<p>What I can see working out is google setting some kind of conversion:cost metric. ie. if you average 1 action per 1,000 displays pay $10/action; if you average 1 action per 100,000 displays pay $500. It will be a challenge determining the initial conversion ratio. But by common logic - it might take 10,000 clicks for someone to buy a Merc online and Merc won't mind paying Goog $500 for it. Problem arises when a $40 product takes 2000 displays to get a sale. <p>Lots of setting standards, way I see it.\n",1174464618

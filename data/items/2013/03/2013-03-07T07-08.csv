THEN I'll refactor as needed, write tests, and since I anticipated my needs, making those tests good and the code testable will be relatively straightforward. That's not TDD, though.

5336625,comment,5335288,5335951,2,0,onedev,,,"Dave, I am an early adopter. I love technology, I love trying out new technology, new apps, and love when sites launch redesigns.<p>However, I was unable to use Path for any considerable length of time. I would open it up every day and say ""Wow that's beautiful"", play with the UI a bit, and that was it. I never really truly ""engaged"" with the app. It seemed the only reason I opened it up was to admire its beauty.<p>True, I don't have many friends on there (I think I had 4 or 5, of which only 1 used it regularly). But that hadn't stopped me from engaging with 4square for a while, or any of the other apps out there. What I'm saying is, although I don't use 4sq anymore, when I did use it, I really got into it for a certain period of time.<p>Now if Path can't attract someone like me (who should be the easiest demographic to attract) how do you plan to grow the service? Now, while it's true that you shouldn't optimize for users, but rather, optimize for the experience, how does this particular experience offer me something more that I can't already get from Facebook or Twitter or Instagram? What is it that I'm getting that would make me say ""Hey I am going to spend x amount of my limited time in a day to use this app"" (keeping in mind that I'm an early adopter and that I'm more inclined to spend more of my finite time per day on things like this)?<p>Now let's assume Path did offer me more value for something FB or Twitter or Instagram couldn't do as well. Sometimes ""good-enough"" trumps ""the best"", and this holds especially when all my friends are on the ""good-enough"" service, which actually makes it the best service for my needs (bear with me on the logic). Now again, although network effects are strong and you shouldn't be scared to fight them, this brings us back to the question of value-add. You mentioned elsewhere that 'families' and other close groups was a popular use-case, but this puts the burden of recruitment on the user doesn't it? Wouldn't the user have to see enough of a value add to justify the time and effort it would take to get their close groups on a service (and how does this type of behavior scale to a more casual or mainstream audience?).<p>I'm just unable to see the short term vision, and I'm certainly unable to see the long term vision. While this usually means you're doing something right, in this instance, you're competing in a completely saturated market dominated by network effects never seen before in the history of the world. All of this is even before we ask perhaps the most important questions of all; ""How do we make money?"". Which, I'm fully prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt for now, because I think the other ones are more pressing for the actual service (excluding the business part of it).<p>How do you plan to address these kinds of tough tough questions moving forward? I'm sure these are the things you think about each and every day, and I'm sure your team is working incredibly hard to answer them with every blood sweat and tear that they exude, but I'd like to know how you personally plan to address these questions and realities.<p>Now with full disclosure, I'm just a kid, still in school studying Computer Science, and have no where near the amount of experience you do with building services and companies around those services. I'm curious how someone with your experiences approaches these kinds of questions.",1362642149

5336602,comment,5336055,5336055,1,0,pitchups,,,"The history of science is filled with ideas and theories that were heretical or even nonsensical at the time they were first proposed - only to be accepted later as part of mainstream science. That is how science progresses. Just a century ago, wave-particle duality was a heretical idea, as was the notion that gravity bends space-time, or black holes exist, or even that the universe is expanding, and so on.   Even Einstein could not accept the ""spooky action-at-a-distance"" implications of quantum mechanics - a theory he helped formulate early on. In fact, every major shift in our worldview has come from such paradigm shifts that start with fringe ideas that challenge conventional wisdom or dogma - starting with Galileo challenging the Church's dogma about a geocentric universe. Every age has its own sets of dogmas and beliefs that preclude other ways of viewing the world. The current scientific dogma is that the universe consists  of stuff and phenomena that are   entirely explainable by a materialistic, mechanistic worldview.  It is dogma because it is an unshakable belief that automatically excludes any other ways of looking at the world. And even more revealing, in every age, it is just a handful of scientists  - never the majority - who challenge our most sacred assumptions, and overturn the old paradigm to usher in a new way of looking at the world. That said - does not mean or imply that every heretical idea should be embraced.

Use immutable values:<p>Models used in client server communication need to follow Java Bean spec which is like the exact antagonistic concept to immutability. Service methods that implement business logic are stateless. As objects are not shared  across threads, nobody feels the need for immutability. The most popular frameworks Spring and Hibernate dictate this architecture.<p>2. Do no work in the constructor<p>Are constructors still used? All services are wired using dependency injection. Models are either DTOs or Hibernate POJOs - both dumb and anyways don't do any work.<p>3. Program to small interfaces:<p>Interfaces are dictated by functionality they provide and not size. They can have hundreds  of methods. This is how it looks:  DocumentService - put every document related method in here,  FinancialInstrumentService  - put every instrument related method in here<p>4. Represent computation, not the world<p>Almost everybody begins OOP with this misconception - objects in real world directly map to OOP objects. Its maybe a good place to start but how many grow up from the initial simplistic rule - map nouns in requirements to classes. So, you end up with objects that don't really mean anything and don't do much. Naive use of UML diagrams also leads to this. Discovering abstractions is tricky. One needs to really live with requirements inside out before they present themselves. Who has so much time? Believe me in a quarterly release- developers get around only 3 weeks  rest is divided into BA, QA, UAT, freeze, deployment time.<p>PS: Please dont get me wrong OP makes good points. It's sweet but the reality is different. May be Google does this (and they do in Guava which is just an example one after another of good stuff in Effective Java).

So assuming no disemployment effects, it basically transfers wealth from everyone who buys the products of low-wage labor (disproportionately from the poor) to people who work minimum wage jobs, some of whom are also poor. It also kills some low-wage workers' jobs.<p>By contrast, EITC is a transfer from people who pay income tax (disproportionately the rich) to people with low incomes. So unlike the minimum wage increase, it is unambiguously beneficial to the poor.<p>In my personal opinion, one of the big reasons the minimum wage is so popular (and it really is, even across party lines) is that the costs are hidden, so people can pretend it's being paid for by big bad corporations even though the costs are ultimately borne by disproportionately poor consumers.",1362641053

One of the main reasons for creating the Constitution was that the Articles of Confederation made it too difficult for the government to use military force against US citizens on US soil, e.g. Shays's Rebellion. The Constitution allows Congress to raise and use an army -- such as through an Authorization for the Use of Military Force -- and to destroy ""Insurrections"", i.e. US citizens on US soil. And when the President swears to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies, foreign and domestic"", what did you think ""and domestic"" means?<p>And no, you don't have a Fifth Amendment to not be shot at when you join the enemy during a war; and no, being a citizen does not give you rights, and the Constitution does not grant you rights.

I thought that in Los Angeles, a city with latino population measured in the several millions, I'd be able to find some kind of book shop catering to Spanish speakers.  But I never did.  The most promising place -- Libreria Mexico de Echo Park -- appeared to be out of business when I went by one afternoon.  I asked a few native speakers near the shuttered bookshop where else I might be able to find books and nobody had any suggestions.  But maybe they just didn't want to talk to a crazy gringo.<p>If anybody knows a good place to browse and buy spanish language books in the LA area, I'd love to know about it.",1362640010

5336518,comment,5336228,5336228,12,0,skrebbel,,,"Nice article. It does, however, trigger a thought:<p>> <i>By making values mutable, this magical-changing-at-a-distance is always a possibility.</i><p>I agree, very much so. However, I could also simply promise that none of my code, nowhere, will modify that DateTime. On top of that, I'll ask all my colleagues to not mistreat it either.<p>Now, that's what many of us are doing now, and the entire point if the OP's first section is that that's just asking for trouble. But how is that fundamentally different from promising to never call toRubles() on a DateTime object? That's what you do with dynamic typing. Yo, here's an object. Please only call methods that it has, and I won't tell you which those are so you'll have to guess the types it may have and then browse to the API docs first (unless it has a <i>method_missing</i>, which you'll have too look at the API docs for as well - but what if it's duck typing and only one of the ducks quacks <i>method_missing</i>?)<p>Sure, I'm exaggerating. I like dynamic typing. I just have the idea that immutability is for nouns what static typing is for verbs. Just like Java has it half-assed, I feel a bit that Clojure has it half-assed the other way around.<p>In terms of Steve Yegge's conservative vs liberal discussion[0], it feels like Clojure went all liberal on one end, just to get super-conservative on the other.<p>[0] <a href=""https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4v...</a>",1362639814

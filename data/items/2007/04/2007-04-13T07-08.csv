He's an amazing hacker and a reluctantly-badass entrepreneur.<p>I'm sure Twitter will use memcached, like Facebook/Digg both do. Dealing with 11k rps doesn't really tell us much though -- how many are dynamic and how many are cachable/static?<p>From the ""5 questions"" interview their developer does not seem to be amazingly qualified to do what he's doing -- definitely no Fitzpatrick.",1176450811

12489,comment,12282,12479,0,0,elialfordj,,,"Do all VC funded startups have traffic? Do all VC funded Startups have a reputation among VCs? I was obviously not making a statement about ""all"" VC funded companies. If we're talking about what is important to venture capitalists when evaluating startups seeking early stage financing, I think revenue should have been a good candidate for that short list of qualities. If you can show in a small test market that your model is capable of generating revenue, and your model is scalable, this is going to look pretty appealing to your prospective financier. Not every startup involves some abstract technical concept, it is possible to build a company with revenues from the start. ",1176449999

12486,comment,12441,12441,0,0,felipe,,,"I totally agree with the concept that speed does not really matter because hardware is cheaper than programmers. And I never understood the criticism towards Ruby being slow... If it improves my productivity, who cares?<p>However, the REAL problem I see here is that apparently the very features that make Rails productive must be thrown away for the application to scale. If that's the case, then that's a <i>huge</i> issue and even a show-stopper if you ask me.<p>I think the problem lies on how clustering is usually implemented in Rails. I'm not an expert, but my understanding is that Mongrel distributes the load across multiple web servers, right? If that's the case, then the bottleneck becomes the database, and that's the key issue IMHO (and the hardest one to solve).<p>In Java (more specifically JBoss), clustering is implemented at the application logic level: The app server manages the state of the application and then it caches and replicates the state whenever necessary.<p>I really don't see how Rails will solve this problem unless with some kind of application-level communication across the servers... And that's a tough one. Suffice to say that the Java community took like 10 years to come up with something effective!<p>Note: Please don't take me wrong: I'm not trying to start a Rails vs. Java war here! I'm just sharing my experience on how Java solved this issue...",1176449589

I can't help think that if some of these tools intelligently applied with twitter (or MySpace) they might be doing better than '11,000 s' ~ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=12441"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=12441</a><p>The reason I added this was I was looking for topics on scaling. Google (lots of reads), Livejournal (lots of writes & reads) must be doing something right in scaling to have a look at.  One point Paul Buchheit [0] made in Startup School 2007 was the difference b/w types of data. Big data & small data. The later you should use DRAM for. Wonder if Twitter uses 'memcached'?<p>

12483,comment,12441,12481,0,0,brett,,,"Yeah. It's a give and take to be sure. I'd take Twitter's current position any day. But you're right they're still in a position to stay ahead of competition and net productivity of development and scaling has to be considered. <p>Worth noting Twitter's audience is using it a lot differently than Techcrunch's is, so relative audience size is not totally meaningful.

12482,comment,12168,12272,0,0,felipe,,,"IMHO the article in the PDF is highly biased, like for example when it takes the ""Sixteen Decisions"" completely out of context. The article also makes a number of claims without mentioning any sources at all. The only piece of reference provided is the infamous 2001 WSJ article, which was already extensively debunked way before the Nobel Prize.<p>There is no feminist agenda. Grameen lands mostly to women based on their own experience showing that: 1) Women are more likely to pay the loan back; and 2) Women tend to invest the loan in long-term basis (ex: buying a cow to sell milk). The fact is that women are highly marginalized in developing countries, and men magically starts to listen to them when they somehow are able to make decisions without the men's approval. Women have a vested interest in the loan, and therefore they tend to be better payers.<p>Don't believe on such ""experts"" -- If their theories were right, developing countries would be prosper by now :)

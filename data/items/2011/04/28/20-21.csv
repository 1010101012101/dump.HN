2495047,comment,2491908,2494926,3,0,SwellJoe,,,"Taubes argues from the perspective of percentage of total intake. I suppose someone arguing with him could do the same. I tend to prefer the idea of discussing absolute consumption, as you've done, and when we look at it that way, Americans are eating more of everything, across the board: More fat, more sugar, more carbs, more white flour, more pasta, more sodas, more fruit, more meat, etc.<p>The simplest explanation is that we eat too much. Taubes often argues that's not true, and comes up with elaborate theories about insulin response and such to indicate that we eat too much not because we're gluttonous and too rich for our own good, but because we are victims of some hyper-fattening food (carbs). Taubes theory is a hunch, based on incomplete science. This was the point of my comment way up there at the start of all this. His theory <i>might</i> have some validity. But, you can't simply wave away the fact that we have vast data indicating that a high carb, low fat diet, can be extremely healthy and not lead to weight gain. In fact, the best evidence we have today from large populations indicates that a low-fat, low-sugar, high fiber diet, like that eaten by the Japanese until very recently or in some Mediterranean regions, is probably the best we can do for health and longevity.<p>It will take a <i>lot</i> of science to convince me that flipping that on its end and making saturated fats and animal proteins a core part of your diet is healthier (or even healthy, at all, though it does appear to be dramatically less dangerous than the American scientific establishment would have us believe).<p>Anyway, I don't know if Taubes is right or wrong about his insulin and carbs conspiracy theory. I <i>do</i> know, however, that our food production industry has figured out how to cram a lot of calories into foods with little to no nutrition. So, skip the processed/packaged foods. Eat more whole foods. More fresh/frozen produce. Stop buying things that are unrecognizably separated from their original form. i.e. if it started out as a pile of corn and some other ingredients and is now a can of Coke, a snack cake, a donut, a breakfast bar, a ""chicken"" nugget, or a ""whole grain"" breakfast cereal; skip it; it's probably not really food and is probably a net negative for your health.",1304024090

2495044,comment,2491908,2494594,1,0,beagle3,,,"> I imagine you have a more nuanced point, but the statement you quoted is clearly true taken for what it actually is saying.<p>You are right, of course. Without quantifying (how low is ""low calorie""?) these statements are useless.<p>There was an experiment in Mass General some 15 years ago, in which they were able to get people with similar lifestyle/activity on 1500 cal/day diet. About one third lost weight, one third stayed the same weight, and one third gained weight, depending on how exactly the diet was composed.<p>Yes, you will lose weight, regardless of diet composition, on less than 800 kcal/day. Is that ""low calorie""? ""too low calorie""? ""moderate""?.<p>No, you will not necessarily lose weight on more than 800 kcal/day. You probably will if your diet was not specially crafted to make you keep your weight on 800 kcal. When you get up to the 1200-1500 range, there is a non-negligible probability of ""accidentally"" gaining weight (or at least not lose it) by randomly stumbling on a bad diet composition.<p>One of Cabanac's (If I'm not mistaken) experiment was able to make rats gain weight for 3 weeks on a diet of water+chalk (caloric value 0) for a while, by feeding them water+sugar+chalk for a while, and then dropping the sugar. Sure, it was water gain - but the calories in - calories out theory fails so miserably in this case (and countless others) that it cannot be taken seriously. (For only 3 weeks for a rat; it might not hold for a human for a few months in similar conditions).<p>The calorie accounting is an approximation at best, which possibly takes several months to a year to average out reasonably, whereas a lot of the research focuses on results over 3 months or less.",1304024020

BTW, this can't be forced but can be facilitated by creating the right conditions and I think that's what Joel's post is about.\nOne more thing: having lunch with people only loosely connected to your day-to-day activities is also very interesting and can lead to serendipitous insights about things totally in your area of expertise.",1304023859

You could rewrite everything and make it better for yourself, but it's hubris to think that any upgrade is going to be perfect and you could easily miss some small features or add bugs that make things worse for all those users.

For starters, I wouldn't really trust a service from someone who advertises themselves as a student entrepreneur as it sound unprofessional as if I should excuse bugs because you're a student. Also, I think this only used to be impressive... like in the 90s or even early 2000 but now it just seems like you're trying to hard to pitch yourself as a student.

Where are that country's immigration rules posted on the World Wide Web? Would you rather live there than in the United States?<p>2) What countries offer easy and convenient immigration to an arbitrary person from an arbitrary country, say an African person who would like to start a new life by founding a business in some developed country? Where could that person immigrate readily and legally?<p>3) What countries allow Americans readily to settle with permanent residence status that could turn into citizenship after an application on the same terms that Vivek Wadhwa advocates that the United States offer to citizens of other countries? What countries are currently visible examples of the results of the kind of policy he proposes? Would you rather live in one of those countries than in the United States?<p>4) Is there any country on earth that has a NET inflow of immigrants from the United States, compared to the number of its own citizens who emigrate to the United States? What country is that? What are its immigration rules?

Without that vetting process, we invite a state of perpetual lies, because very few people in power will tell the truth when there is no consequence for telling a lie.<p>I don't think that taking the president and numerous government officials (who have little to gain by lying) at their word that Obama is a citizen is that much of a stretch of logic. If you think being called a racist for insisting that Obama is a foreign national is unwarranted, I'd ask when the last time you even considered such a thing about <i>any</i> president much less voiced it.<p>In the end, though, I firmly believe that Obama released this document for those in the center and center-right of the political spectrum, not for the hard-right who demanded to see it lest they initiate some kind of armchair revolution. Producing this document will not silence the far right, but the fact that it won't will push them further into the fringes in the view of mainstream Americans.

2494996,comment,2494647,2494647,14,0,abalashov,,,"Perspective from a highly educated, legal immigrant family:<p>I came here with my parents, who emigrated from the former USSR via the student visa route in 1992.  This is one of the hardest paths to permanent residency in the US because a great deal of student visas either explicitly foresee a return of the student to their native country for some period of time (owing to various reciprocal treaties to that effect), or are implicitly structured to discourage permanent immigration per se.<p>Somehow, my parents defied the odds, frequently hopping between various F, J and H-class visas, begging for employer sponsorship through these processes in an already grossly unfavourable job market (humanities academia).  In at least one case, I remember that making changes to visa status before the existing visa expired required short-circuiting the INS bureaucracy and going to the US consulate in a Mexican border town to get the job done--ironically, much faster.<p>It wasn't even until 2002--a decade later--that we had a greencard.  Up until that point, if my dad had been dismissed by any of his employers or lost his student for any reason, we would have had to return to our country immediately, from where trying to seek new opportunities along these lines--especially in the 1990s--would have been impractically difficult.  Worse yet, a petition for a greencard from many classes of visa means that if for some reason the petition is denied, you forfeit your existing visa and also must leave.  And of course, employer sponsorship was required.<p>We finally became naturalised US citizens in 2008, 16 years later, well after I had spent close to 3/4ths of my life here.  And many commentators who work with people in our situation have remarked that this was brisk and efficient.<p>While I am definitely speaking from the vantage point of a particular visa classification and method of entry, I don't gather that our situation is that uncommon.  The number one problem that I see with American immigration from an economic perspective is that it's <i>simply too hard to immigrate here</i> (legally)[1], and most especially as a highly educated or highly skilled person.  Marrying an American or obtaining a refugee status of some description is a much more efficient path to permanent residency, for example.  Meanwhile, a person with an existing PhD like my dad had to essentially get another PhD to become employable here[2], while persuading employers all throughout to argue that there no equally suitable American candidate was found for his job, etc, etc.  I have not seen janitors face such hurdles.<p>I will freely grant that it's not nearly as hard to immigrate to the US legally as it is to say, Western Europe, but it's also not as easy as Canada or some other Western countries whose immigration systems admit an explicit preference for high qualifications.  And as the author points out, with domestic economies becoming more and more attractive, it just isn't worth the effort to fight with this immigration system like it used to be.<p>EDIT: To relate this back to Vivek Wadhwa's article:  We come from Moscow.  In the early 1990s, following the dissolution of the USSR, Moscow was a pretty miserable place to live.  Coupled with the enthusiasm to leave the Soviet context in general, the appeal of America was pretty clear.  Nowadays, Moscow is not a particularly miserable place (although the reasons for that, and the question of whether they are good, sustainable reasons, are a separate discussion entirely), and few people in Moscow, whether part of the noveau elite or otherwise, are deluded with the idea that they can find a better life in America--they already live in a gold-plated bubble rapidly coming to rival Manhattan sensibilities.  So for whom does the US remain an attractive destination in Russia?  Mostly provincial, less-educated people from poorer, simpler places.  I read Wadhwa's article to be saying that--extrapolating from this more generally--this does not set up the incentives we really want.<p>[1]  I found this chart from Reason Magazine to be a pretty accurate illustration of the problem: <a href=""http://reason.org/files/a87d1550853898a9b306ef458f116079.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.org/files/a87d1550853898a9b306ef458f116079.pdf</a><p>[2]  Yes, that's technically a separate issue from immigration policy and is rather tied up in the specificity of his profession, but if you want to talk about the amount of mountain-moving required to move to the US permanently, as a whole, it deserves consideration.",1304023287

They're able to do so because they have very sophisticated software systems that can handle an awful lot of things automatically. But run into something that requires a human to do something and stuff breaks down. They're just not staffed for it.<p>And it's not clear they realistically could be staffed to handle it well. Though Amazon seems to do a better job than the others. So arguably you can provide better service if you're willing to invest in it. But for Facebook and Google, beyond some VERY base level, better customer service is a cost that probably wouldn't drive much in the way of revenue.",1304022597

I had been eating with the mathematicians and I found out that I already knew a fair amount of mathematics; in fact, I wasn't learning much. The physics table was, as he said, an exciting place, but I think he exaggerated on how much I contributed. It was very interesting to listen to Shockley, Brattain, Bardeen, J. B. Johnson, Ken McKay and other people, and I was learning a lot. But unfortunately a Nobel Prize came, and a promotion came, and what was left was the dregs. Nobody wanted what was left. Well, there was no use eating with them!<p>Over on the other side of the dining hall was a chemistry table. I had worked with one of the fellows, Dave McCall; furthermore he was courting our secretary at the time. I went over and said, ""Do you mind if I join you?"" They can't say no, so I started eating with them for a while. And I started asking, ""What are the important problems of your field?"" And after a week or so, ""What important problems are you working on?"" And after some more time I came in one day and said, ""If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?"" I wasn't welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with! That was in the spring.<p>In the fall, Dave McCall stopped me in the hall and said, ""Hamming, that remark of yours got underneath my skin. I thought about it all summer, i.e. what were the important problems in my field. I haven't changed my research,"" he says, ""but I think it was well worthwhile."" And I said, ""Thank you Dave,"" and went on. I noticed a couple of months later he was made the head of the department. I noticed the other day he was a Member of the National Academy of Engineering. I noticed he has succeeded. I have never heard the names of any of the other fellows at that table mentioned in science and scientific circles. They were unable to ask themselves, ""What are the important problems in my field?""</i>",1304022287

New frameworks (Snap, Yesod) have sprung up, and the library and toolchain support have improved immeasurably.<p>To answer some of your questions a little more directly (I hope someone like dons with a more encyclopaedic knowledge can pitch in here):<p>* As a <i>language</i>, Haskell is both very stable and very cutting-edge. This is because GHC (the only Haskell compiler people use seriously for production, at least as far as I'm aware) supports both the Haskell '98 standard, and the more recent Haskell 2010 standardbut it also supports a large number of language extensions [1] such as type families, existential types, GADTs etc. So<p>* In terms of scalability, some of the recent benchmarks for Haskell-based web servers have been very impressive. Whether or not this translates into real-world performance is something we'll see as more people start using them in production. Recent improvements to the GHC I/O manager make the case for Haskell more compelling in this regard than it used to be.<p>* It's pretty easy in Haskell to write wrappers around C libraries, such as OpenSSL. There are also moves to implement more of these core parts of any web stack in pure Haskell, although getting them to feature-completion is a process that will take time.<p>A couple of recent reads spring to mind: a Stack Overflow discussion [1] where Alex Payne asked about Haskell tools to make programs production-ready, and Johan Tibell's article [2] on which Haskell libraries one should use.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.0.3/html/users_guide/ghc-language-features.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.0.3/html/users_guide/ghc-l...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5808825/what-are-the-best-haskell-libraries-to-operationalize-a-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5808825/what-are-the-best...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blog.johantibell.com/2011/04/haskell-libraries-you-should-use.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.johantibell.com/2011/04/haskell-libraries-you-sh...</a>",1304020889

4640168,comment,4636857,4636857,2,0,willyt,,,"Some super quick comments.<p>What is the mechanical engineering behind this? Did you do all the calcs? Simulate it in CAD or something? Gas struts need to be tuned to the weight you are counter balancing; are you selling or recommending a particular mattress with this? How much resistance do the gas struts provide at the top of the stroke, what happens if you drop it at 3/4 raised? Do you need to fix this back to the wall or floor; i.e. could the whole thing topple over on top of you if it jammed while you were lowering it? Can you see all the parts where childrens fingers might get caught from the raising lowering position? The desk pantograph mechanism has quite slender struts, they look like they could be quite easily damaged.<p>Most double beds have a central beam under the slats and a lot more slats than this. Why is yours different?<p>In general, it's one thing to use your own prototype where you have an intuitive understanding of its weaknesses, but when other people use it they will break things you wouldn't expect. Will it fail safe?<p>It looks terrible, some bits of structure look too big and some too small. There are parts of the design where the same problem has been solved with a different solution, why isn't it symmetrical?<p>$650 Including all labour? Seems too cheap. Are you expecting people to build this out of construction grade timber like the prototype?",1349949591

4640166,comment,4639085,4639935,1,0,manmal,,,"If you find a tutorial which solves this very problem you are facing, then you are surely good to go. I doubt however that you will find a tutorial on ""how to increase traffic to a specific website by 10%"". But that's what people actually pay for. They don't pay big bucks for you to implement that simple app or to fix that NullPointerException in their Java web app. I've been there. Yes, they might pay you $100/h for that, but not $10000 for the whole task.<p>You do need sharp wits and problem solving ability to deliver this kind of value, you need your methods in place (e.g. testing and validating everything) and you need to know where to look for unknowns. A good pitch is not the whole story as much as problem solving abilities are not the whole story.",1349949517

4640161,comment,4639085,4639085,7,0,Silhouette,,,"Just as a minor PSA: I get that certain consultant types around these parts are always saying ""raise your rates"", and I get that a lot of people who work freelance do undercharge and often significantly, but the advice has very limited value unless it has some sort of quantifiable element attached to it. Otherwise, with due respect to those consultant types, it sounds a lot like ""We're obviously smarter than you, because we charge enough and we're sure you don't"" without any real data to back up such a claim.<p>Obviously rates vary dramatically according to many factors other than the desire of the freelancer/consultant/whatever who wants to charge them: location, industry, level of experience/credibility/relevant specialist skills, and so on. But without even a general indication of how much the poster child consultants of HN have succeeded in putting their own rates up before dispensing this advice endlessly to everyone else, it's hard to take seriously the idea that an average freelancer who isn't Internet famous is going to jump from their normal rate to something on a different kind of level, at least not without fundamentally changing the way they're working in a lot more ways than just the cost per unit time on invoices.<p>Let me ask a very simple question, which hopefully those consultants might be able to answer without giving away anything sensitive about the specific rates they are personally charging right now: if the going rate for freelance software development work in your area is typically in the range $x-$y, and you have moved via successive rate increases and repositioning what you offer to $z, approximately what are the ratios between x, y and z? For extra marks, since in the podcast a comparison was drawn with the way lawyers charge, how would z compare to a typical range for lawyers working in the same area and with the same kinds of clients?",1349949414

Business situations are different from academic settings where an alpha of 5% is more or less the rule.\nWe do not look for publications in scientific journals, nor do we engage for instance in medical research  and even there -, we are in a business situation trying to optimize decision making.<p>Up to us to decide for an alpha of 10% or 20%, as long as we are fully aware of the consequences of such choices. I am not advocating going easy on statistical significance, I am in favour of weighing consequences and such can only be properly done if one masters the dynamics of reliabilty and power of a test. That could also mean you wanted a reliability of 99% and a power of 99%, it all depends on the risks you want take with your specific research questions.",1349949314

He'd create one-page microsites (similar to what Launchrock offers nowadays), buy up proper domains, and then test his product idea by purchasing search engine ads.<p>Not only could he iterate on product idea by tweaking the search ads and reacting to CTR changes, but visitors to the sites were advised to leave their email, so by the time the product was ready to launch, he'd have a great opt-in list.",1349946525

4640083,comment,4638120,4639978,6,0,rrreese,,,"The thing to understand is that Microsoft's main customers are larger business and government, who have large installations. These organisations tend to be very conservative. They don't like to just deploy software/updates, rather they usually put them on test systems and check that the updates don't affect other software.<p>I.E is also a lot more integrated into windows then the other browsers. So chrome largely just needs to test that their browser works, Microsft needs to test that that the browser works one each version of windows (Vista/7/8) but also all versions (Pro, Home Basic, home Premium etc), but also for all supported languages (Dutch Windows Pro, Dutch Home Basic etc). In addition they need to test that an I.E update doesn't break other software like installers, Office, popular non Microsoft software that makes use of I.E.<p>Given that their customers will probably take their time updating it makes sense for Microsoft to very carefully test any updates as a hot patch released 10 hours after a bug is found probably won't be widely deployed any faster then one released 10 days later. And 10 hours probably isn't long enough to test all the software that relies on I.E in some manner.",1349946461

The network effect is extremely hard to master and takes a lot of money/time to do so. Hence why the fees are as high as they are.<p>Network Effect as in they use their sizable userbase to prevent any other competition in the space. For online auctions to work you need a large buyer base so it can attract a large seller base.<p>I never said it was easy or difficult, not even sure you need to ""master"" it, but who cares? That wasn't even an important point of that sentence, which was that it's difficult to sell anywhere BUT eBay because of the Network Effect<p>Fees are high because eBay has no idea how to keep earning money except to gouge people. They certainly can't make buyers pay anything so the sellers essentially get dumped with more and more ""fees"". I am still confused how that relates to the discussion about the Network Effect. They worked hard initially and now they deserve to gouge people who are using their site?<p>> Care to elaborate? I wasn't under the impression ebay was doing either.[1]<p>I cannot prove either but how does showing a stock price disprove what I said? They can still lose marketshare and still have a positive stock price. And they continue to make profits because they continue to bleed their sellers dry.<p>Ask anyone (or I guess, just sellers would be more accurate) if they would use eBay if they had to. They would say, ""Fuck No"", so why do they use it? Because, Network Effect.",1349946072

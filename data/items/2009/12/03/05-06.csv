Of course within minutes I signed up because I wanted to save my playlist. UI was extremely clean, fast, and intuitive and worked excellently in my outdated Firefox browser on linux.<p>Just now I went to mog.com... ""discover music through people and people through music""... and ""where music listens to you""... and ""Better Than Rhapsody, Pandora and iTunes... Combined."". Lame first impression.<p>I click ""Try it free""... but I have to enter my email, screenname, password twice, TOC checkbox, and a captcha. screw it! Then I'll have to pay later?<p>Of course, will Grooveshark the Audiogalaxy (but better) of 2009 survive as it is today?<p>And as far as long-tail catalog depth... I'll need some more man-hours to see how deep it goes, I'm assuming Mog will be deeper and have better discovery features.

(given it's 7 am and I am barely awake)<p>When presenting a method or a program to students, I try to start from as scratch as reasonable. I recently prepared an experiment for a student of ours, and essentially wrote the program in front of him, running it at intermediate stages so he could see it evolve. He felt comfortable changing the functionality afterwards, so I expect the information transfer worked. I've done the same before with small student groups, creating something minimal, but perfectly understood.<p>For negotiation situations, I prefer doing them in person or at the very least over the phone, but preferably so that I have all the data in front of me. At that point, I want the other person's attention focused on me, not on the projection screen.<p>When showing a thing, like a program or a concept, I like to show the thing rather than showing something that shows the thing. I'd explain it and demonstrate it rather than showing slides about it. I might show photos of it being used in situations I can't directly reproduce.<p>In all of these situations, slideware would not have noticeably improved things.

If I join your club I should expect to abide by the rules set by the members according to the process that existed when I joined, just because I think the walls of the clubhouse should be painted blue doesn't mean that I can decide on a whim paint a small part of the wall.

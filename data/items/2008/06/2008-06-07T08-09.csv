211471,comment,211236,211450,0,0,mdakin,,,"Really I think it's just applied poetry.  The rational argument associated with the point is boring.  Parsing out ""envelope of serendipity"" might take epsilon more time/effort but it's that epsilon which causes you to feel a small spark of discovery WHILE parsing the sentence.  That feeling of discovery convolves with the conceptual meaning of the sentence and immediately you mentally associate with the similar spark-like feeling of serendipity, and probably also remember a couple of times things like this HAVE happened at parties too.  It seems pretty elegant to me.  Perhaps it is a rhetorical trick but it's also good people-hacking.",1212828772

However, if she were truly guessing randomly, you'd only expect her to be right (.5(.8) + .5(.2)) * 100 = 50% of the time.<p>All you can conclude is that whatever strategy she's using, it's about as good as the best <i>non-random</i> strategy you could devise given prior knowledge of the situation.",1212828366

At least some (more likely, most) of your customers will stay, and you'll be able to afford working on just one or two interesting software projects at a time.<p>There are other downsides to a lack of diversification though, like being less able to drop one of your customers if necessary.",1212828056

Short answer for those interested:<p>Internet access is... acceptable. I brought an Airport Express and upon arriving at the scuba resort here I just asked them if I could plug it in. They'd been hoping to setup wireless for a while but hadn't had a router, so they were fine with it. Voila, wireless. Problem being, it's usually 5-20kb/s, with my co-founder getting up to 200kb/s. I think it's because he has Wireless N to my Wireless B/G. Should have upgraded to a newer laptop before leaving, but live and learn.<p>Sure, hanging out and talking with friends at one of the beachside bars, going driving around the island and exploring, or reading/writing. I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to having fun, just give me a great conversation in a cool locale, whether that be a SF coffee shop, a BA tango club, or a Koh Tao beach, and I'm good to go.<p>Haven't been around, as of yet. Upon getting into Bangkok's airport I booked a domestic flight on over to Koh Samui and got there three hours after arriving in Bangkok. Koh Samui was a lot more touristy than Koh Tao, and in general just seemed to be developed too quickly. When I first got there I was amazed (beach! warm weather! jungle!), but in retrospect I prefer Koh Tao by leaps and bounds.<p>If anyone else has any questions, I'm not great about checking Hacker News comments, so feel free to hit me up by email as well, it's in my profile.",1212826516

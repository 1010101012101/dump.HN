8387557,comment,8384807,8384807,0,0,cel1ne,,,"Drugs are a fascinating topic in my opinion, because they have affected humankind and it&#x27;s decisions since ever and more than anyone wants to admit. It&#x27;s a topic that is everywhere, and that simultaneously nobody has a clue about (a bit like climate change or high finance). People don&#x27;t know which drugs there are, how they work, how dangerous they are, how much they are used etc.<p>I talked to many people who are affected by the topic: teachers, psychologists, doctors, concerned relatives. I keep telling them: Even in this rich city Vienna, drugs aren&#x27;t something that pops up in dark alleys behind trainstations, drugs are everywhere and used by functioning people you had no idea about. And they use massive amounts.<p>There are doctors who say that they tell their clients, that it&#x27;s ok to smoke one or two cannabis-joints a week. What they don&#x27;t realize is that a regular smoker (which might be a 13-year-old) doesn&#x27;t smoke one per week, but more like 5 joints a day. 
This is a point which get&#x27;s more important now that states around the world are legalizing cannabis. It really isn&#x27;t very hazarous, in the sense that it kills you or makes you unable to function, so people can get used to smoking excessive amounts. But: every psychoactive substance you take constantly will, by definition, change you. When usage-patterns get to the &quot;all the time&quot;-category most points doctors and legalization advocates make become invalid, because now it&#x27;s not about side-effects of a drug you take now and then, but about the effects of a permanently altered state-of-mind you &quot;cultivate&quot;.<p>I regulary ask sellers at highway petrol stations which cigarettes and smoking-utilities they sell the most. There was not only one time where their answer was: long rolling-papers and the lightest tobacco = ingredients for a joint.<p>LSD isn&#x27;t just something out of a Beatles song, some people told be they had tried it with 15, because they could get it at their (noble high-society)-school. There were hooligans at a big local football/&quot;soccer&quot;-stadion charged with possession of it.<p>The issue/problem of cocaine is interesting, because (like cannabis) it is one of the few drugs that permeates all of society from blue-collar-workers to high-society.
I once helped a completely confused guy in a smoking to get a taxi home, who stuttered that he lost his purse while getting high on cocaine on some actor&#x27;s party. He is a painter and a director at one of the famous theatres here, and gifted me a painting he had with him for the taxi-fare I paid.<p>I once saw two truck-drivers delivering goods to the local supermarket around the corner, snorting something of a magazine at 6.30 a.m.<p>It&#x27;s a bit hard to get data about mass of cocaine consumption in the US, but estimations are about 200 tons (400k pounds, please adopt the metric system!) per year. They regularly find unmanned submarines who can transport tons of cocaine. Some of them are sophisticated enough that they might be able to cross the atlantic. Think of the R&D involved there, that cartels have the money to buy.<p>One of the problems in the vietnam-war was that Vietnam was and is a big platform in international drug-trafficking and many US-soldiers got addicted to heroin while trying to &quot;get away&quot; from the war. Estimations are that more than 40.000 soldiers were addicted. Many of them probably still are, no matter what some people say, it&#x27;s close to impossible to get away from heroin/opiates. The only easy way to deal with the poor addicts is provide them with their stuff until the end of their lives.<p>Afghanistan was (still is?) the largest Opium and Cannabis-exporter in the world. Since they don&#x27;t have many other goods than that, in the 90ies the US more or less allowed or tolerated the drug-business there, so the warlords (&quot;afghan resistance&quot;) could buy weapons to hold back Soviet Russia.
So, in the war since 2001 US-money flows to both sides of the conflict. US-soldiers are paid to fight against warlords who get their money from selling their heroin in the US (and in the rest of the world). Isn&#x27;t that ridiculous?<p>[..insert many more anecdotes and hair-raising numbers..]<p>To sum it up:<p>* Drug use is way more excessive than society is comfortable with.<p>* Drugs aren&#x27;t mostly used while sitting on the sofa, they are used while working, while riding vehicles, while doing anything really.<p>* Almost everything people know about drugs (from names to numbers) is incorrect (if they know anything at all).<p>Disclaimer:<p>* Numbers above might be inaccurate, because I don&#x27;t have time for proper references, but the magnitudes should be correct.<p>* This is not an opinion about how to work with the situation (i wouldn&#x27;t call it problem, since drug-use has been always there, it&#x27;s a property/corner-stone of human existence), I have opinions about that, but it&#x27;s a very complicated matter. There&#x27;s also a difference in advising addicted individuals and their relatives, which is (depending on the drug) relatively easy, and finding rules/laws for society at large.",1412074746

8387554,comment,8384641,8384641,0,0,powatom,,,"Yes - despite the bleating about unions from people who I can only assume have never had to fight exploitation and unfair practices, unions are one of the only ways that you as an employee can adequately defend yourself from bad employers AND bad employees.<p>Yes, software developers are generally paid well and if you can earn the respect of your peers, you&#x27;re usually treated pretty well too. However, the industry is rife with horror stories about sexism, over-working, burnout, family disruption, harassment and abuse - not to mention the ridiculous burdens placed on developers who are also expected to be on call 24/7, manage the company&#x27;s IT infrastructure, and generally do whatever the hell their superior demands at a moment&#x27;s notice.<p>For a privileged segment of the industry, there is no problem - but that is by no means representative of the whole. Software mills churn out shitty software and treat their employees with the same respect they give to quality and professionalism.<p>Being part of a union gives you the numbers required to do meaningful damage to a company which doesn&#x27;t treat you right. As always, a balance must be struck between the strength of the employer and the strength of the union(s), but for many in this industry, it&#x27;s currently a losing battle. More and more demands every year, but fuck you if you want to be treated better.<p>Don&#x27;t delude yourselves into thinking that being part of a union is only about money. If you ever have to work ridiculous hours, not see your kids or your partner, suffer from lack of sleep, do things outside of your job spec, and generally just feel like you&#x27;re being taken advantage of, then the reason for this is that YOU ARE INTERCHANGEABLE. You&#x27;re not a special little snowflake just because you&#x27;re pretty darn up to date with the latest technical shizzle-wizzle you read about on HN. You may be technically very proficient, but then so are a lot of your peers, and there&#x27;s no shortage of developers out there.<p>This may be a highly skilled industry, but it&#x27;s also one with a very low barrier to entry and a shit-load of people producing OK work at a fraction of the cost of your salary. You&#x27;re not immune to abuse just because you&#x27;re good at what you do.",1412074695

8387552,comment,8385448,8386125,6,0,morsch,,,"The next step would be exchanging messages via NFC.<p>E.g. say for a p2p-twitter app, users A and B go into the exchange with their own versions of the global p2p-twitter feed, and exit the exchange with a merged version.<p>You could do federated, store-and-forward direct messaging, too. We already have a protocol for a very similar use-case: SMTP. :) Of course, with a sometimes-offline P2P mesh you usually don&#x27;t know if any given hop decreases the distance to the destination.<p>You&#x27;d probably end up just merging all existing messages, so that everyone has everyone elses &quot;email&quot;, and filter out the messages belonging to you via asymmetric encryption. So it&#x27;s just an application of the above p2p-twitter thing. Public messages could be unencrypted.<p>I think some blockchain-based messaging systems work in a similar way, since there everybody has everybody elses messages per definition. Maybe a blockchain-based protocol is a good fit anyway, probably not though since I&#x27;m not sure how it would do the merge(A,B) function.",1412074645

My previous understanding of diffraction was that obstacles cause waves to propagate in different ways.  But the thinning of the atmosphere isn&#x27;t really an &quot;obstacle.&quot;  The molecules that soundwaves use to propagate are simply further apart from each other, meaning waves are more likely to disperse and lose energy than to keep traveling or bounce.  That would imply the boom from the volcano should disperse into space and go silent rather than travel around the Earth.  But since that doesn&#x27;t happen, it seems like the waves follow wherever the atmosphere is thick.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble understanding how diffraction would cause that end result of &quot;waves go where the atmosphere is.&quot;  If waves could bounce off of the thin atmosphere near space, that would make total sense.

People will never agree on using json vs python vs Makefile vs ruby vs shell vs whatever else - they&#x27;ll always want their most familiar language for their package manager, which in domain-specific packaging means the domain-specific language.<p>So don&#x27;t try to standardize those. Standardize the rest. Give us the protocol that can power all of this and increase interoperability. Separate the repository layer, the package format (deb, rpm), the packagefile format (setup.py, Makefile, PKGBUILD) and the package manager (interface: yum, apt-get, aptitude, pip, npm) from the rest of the protocol.<p>Make this potentially usable for things such as browser extension repositories, android package management, vim bundles and what not.<p>Someone please work on this. I&#x27;d do it but it just occured to me I have to clean my oven.",1412071312

The most detailed information I can find online is the executive summary[1], which has to handwave that it found Italy with a strongly <i>negative</i> correlation between parents&#x27; and children&#x27;s economic outcomes! That suggests to me that their methodology is not particularly robust.<p>I&#x27;ve found similar attempts to establish parent/child economic correlation equally suspicious when, for example, they measure income correlation with percentiles rather than in adjusted dollars (it&#x27;s much easier to be &quot;mobile&quot; if there&#x27;s only $10K in income separating the 40th and 60th percentiles!)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2011/CRITAFINAL1pdf.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_as...</a>",1412071238

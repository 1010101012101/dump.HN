5119794,comment,5109424,5109424,1,0,Someone,,,"You write <i>""I want to learn a new programming language, or continue learning one I started in school, something that will compensate for the lack of algorithms in my work""</i><p>If that is all you want, almost any language will do. Maybe, you want to take on a new one every month or so for a while to get a broader view on what's out there. Your experience, it seems, is only with Algol :-), so I would pick something different like lisp, Haskell or Forth.<p>Having said that, I think you should first think more about whether there is a deeper reason why you want to program. It might not even be the programming itself, but the learning itself. If so, reading about programming languages (or maybe even on computing history, physics, linguistics, history,...) can be a better idea. On the other hand, if, in the back of your head, you have this idea to write something to solve problem X, that could direct you in your choice of language.<p>In other words: what is your itch?",1359190697

Not mine, or anyone's, but laws that only seem to get harder, truer and stronger the more I test them and try to break them.<p>Nothing exists but right now.  The past is done, the future doesn't exist. The past is a perception. The future is a hallucination. What is possible tomorrow only depends on what you do now.<p>It's not about the destination, or the journey, but cultivating always, your mindset for any journey.  The destinations are just postcards along the way.<p>Regret/Bitterness is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.<p>Worrying is like praying for what you don't want to happen.<p>Do not feed the monsters of negativity, they don't do anything.<p>What you regret is standing still.  So move.  The world isn't passing you by, you just aren't moving.<p>Inaction and analysis paralysis is only defeated by action.  Thinking doesn't solve many problems worth solving. Doing and figuring it out as you go does.  No one figures out their life before they start, are you sure you aren't doing that?<p>Having a victim's mentality dis-empowers.<p>Building a mindset of responsibility empowers.<p>Empowerment is to learn that leadership isn't about leading others, or following someone, but learning to lead yourself, one thing at a time, and those things coming together over the long run.<p>You're not alone.  You're not the first to think of fell what you do.  You're not the last.  As soon as you can understand this, you can get over your barriers, and over yourself to get on to something better. There is no higher action than right action in the present.<p>You first have to start by learning to be a friend to yourself and developing and maintaining some healthy and positive inner dialogue.  Through that one is able to face and get through most things based on the fact that ""I can stumble my way through this if I let myself figure it out"".<p>Instead of worshiping doubts and the insurmountably of them, dare to live and live in possibility.  Innovation, creation, and change for the better exists in cultivating a mindset of possibility.<p>Thinking isn't doing.  Feeling isn't doing.  Acting is doing.  The only people who are busy looking at others are the ones who aren't busy doing and learning positively from it.<p>If the above doesn't reveal to you that you aren't alone, and there isn't a way to get through it, I'll leave you with this:  Nothing is unique. Not you, or any problems.  There is little issue or perspective that hasn't been thought or explored or agonized over before.<p>Instead of spiraling downward in a self-loathing cycle of reflection, get some new input to reflect on.  Input and reflection go hand in hand to get the epiphanies that help you see things for the better.<p>For me, the sentences above aren't lines.  They're all anchors and keywords tied to lessons learnt alone, without a soul to talk to sometimes, and great support in others.  They are my statement of progress and what I still have to look forward to.  It's taught me the only real thing I know for sure about life is to learn the most I can about myself to be the best I can.<p>I am the startup, and how well I develop myself will determine how well anything I work on develops.<p>Feel free to keep in touch. These are the kinds of conversations I live for, we don't spend enough time working on our insides, and do nothing but distract ourselves from it until we can't bear to anymore.<p>Most importantly, get moving, keep moving.

5119763,comment,5119213,5119213,3,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"""I never saw [them] as more hardworking or intelligent than I""<p>Maybe that's your problem. You're so confident in yourself that you just expect things to happen for you. (That's what my problem was)<p>1) <i>""I would be in competition with others who've been practicing their trade for many years.""</i><p>Common dude that's just BULLSHIT. What do you think college students go through?! They enter a market without any experience, competing with people who are well established and experienced. That's what people do, that's what companies do. The Google guys starting working on a search engine in an era when Microsoft, Yahoo, Lycos, & Alta Vista were established competitors. Same with Facebook > Myspace, same with Walmart > K-Mart > Sears Roebuck, with MS Word > Word Perfect, and the list goes on and on. A bunch of inexperienced no-bodies little by little outrun an experienced established player. Statistically & Historically speaking, you have a chance. So get that ""I can't compete"" argument out of your head. THAT is what's holding you back.<p>2) There's ""problems"" and then there's ""issues"". Problems can be solved. Issues can never be solved, they must be adjusted to. A flat tire is a problem, a hatred of men because of experiences with your father is an issue. And just like losing your legs, not having a childhood, and jealousy due to insecurity, your ""deep seeded regret"" is an issue. You cannot fix it. You can only normalize to it, understand it, and move on from it.<p>3) Cognitive behavioral therapy, as others have mentioned is REALLY amazing and works very well for issues. I got over body dismorphic disorder using CBT. You can't change the world to make yourself feel better, you can only change yourself, your point of view and way of thinking and that's basically what CBT is. CBT can be done with a therapist to talk you through learning to recognize and later stopping the thoughts that lead to your regret. Or you can learn about CBT methods and do it yourself like I did. (I talk to myself 6-12 hours a day which is why I went the self-mediate route. Therapists took too long and were too expensive.)<p>4) Learn that there is a dark side to dreaming, wishing, fantasizing, and desiring. A very dark side that leads to nothing but disappointments and regrets of not having reached the dream, wish, fantasy, or desire. We've been conditioned our whole lives to dream big and keep trying but when you don't reach those dreams you've set yourself up for decades of regret and heartache. You need to stop comparing what you have to what you wish you had, and instead compare what you have with what others do not. You're lucky, realize that.",1359189740

The evidence was clear: despite a start as a brilliant child prodigy, I had history of depression and self-isolation. I didn't got to a great university, just a glorified community college. In the doldrums of 2003-4 I was applying for work slinging PHP at local used car websites and not even getting those jobs.<p>I was sick of trying. So I decided to just... give up, and see what happened.<p>I had this feeling that regular society wasn't for me - that all I could do was to be a homeless drifter. So I gave up looking for work, and just waited for my rent and other expenses to deplete the last few hundred dollars.<p>So then I had nothing to do. No obligations. No jobs to apply for. No need to compete with my ex-colleagues.<p>With nothing better to do I decided to hack on a few things that amused me. We're talking tiny little scripts here, in weird, obscure areas. And then I posted them online. And then, they got some attention, for being weird and different. And then my phone was ringing with calls from recruiters. And a few months after my plan to become a homeless person was set in motion, I was filling out my orientation forms at a campus in Silicon Valley.<p>You may be discounting my story as a fluke. And I got super lucky. But you can also see how flawed my thinking was. And maybe your thinking is similarly flawed.<p>I thought I had nothing to offer, and yet I was a reasonably well-educated person, with a great deal of knowledge, and a certain measure of creativity and even passion for certain topics.  And I bet you're the same way. If you're on Hacker News you probably know something about <i>something</i>. Are you sure you aren't blocking yourself?<p>The reason we get blocked is that we compare ourselves to others. Google ""growth mindset"" versus ""fixed mindset"". Too many of us are taught ""fixed mindset"" - you are smarter, therefore you are better. If you are sucking at something, it's because you are inferior. This is such a painful conclusion, you start to numb down your emotions to deal  with it. Which is why your brain probably feels fogged, and why it's doubly hard to climb out of this state.<p>Your post is <i>dripping</i> with fixed-mindset thinking. According to you, learning new skills is impossible, or will take too long, or isn't worth it. Why? You aren't saying that you can't learn this stuff. You aren't saying you can't have a good career. You're saying it's not worth it <i>because others will be further along.</i> Think about this. It is not rational. You will have <i>nothing</i> if you don't learn new skills (or at least change what you're doing).<p>Furthermore, in today's market, it is not a matter of being the best in one thing. It's about finding your unique niche. By utter luck, I stumbled into doing that for myself. I'm not the best in X or Y or Z but I am among the best, or at least employable, in people who do X+Y+Z.<p>My motivation was despair, which freed me from having to compete, and let my natural inclinations take over. But on the whole, rather than despair, I recommend joy. ;) Looking for what's <i>fun</i> will put you on a better path. You'll home right in on what you're supposed to be doing. I guarantee it.<p>It will be hard to get to that space. You are depressed and have accumulated bad habits from a lifetime of fixed-mindset thinking. And this is fucking with your rationality, no matter what it seems. One way to fix your thinking is cognitive-behavioral therapy. See if you can find a professional in your area.",1359188831

I am not a lawyer, but I am a songwriter and have researched this a lot in the past.  It's complicated enough that it's easy to forget the particulars, but the general upshot is that if you do a cover, no matter how creative your cover is, you basically have no rights except for the sound recording.<p>Your book example is a different question entirely.<p>Look at it this way.  You can also take a song <i>with</i> a melody, and completely alter the melody into something entirely different, but it doesn't mean that you get a songwriter credit on the new version.  If it did, people would be doing this all the time.  And the original version of the song isn't ""half a song"", as in everything but a melody - not legally speaking.  If that were true, we'd have thirty years now of people trying to write melodies for already-released rap tunes, in an effort to get their financial cut.<p>So legally speaking, putting a melody on a rap tune still only yields a derivative work.  Coulton has no rights as a songwriter in this case.<p>Again though, if Fox took the audio to his backing track... that's a different matter entirely.<p>One big asterisk, though.  It might be too late for this, but Coulton arguably could have gathered more leverage had he called his version a parody.  But that's a really high bar, because for it to be a parody, it would have to implicitly comment on the previous work, thereby transforming it.  As opposed to a simple satire, which ""builds on top"" of an existing work.  A parody is protected by fair use, and it is possible to copyright the original parts of the parody.  So if he had been able to argue that his song was a parody, he could have copyrighted the melody.  And given that Coulton's artistic choice was limited to putting a nice melody on top of a rap tune, I doubt that would hold up in court, because it would set a hell of a precedent to all the other rap tunes out there.",1359187656

Examples!<p>> I can see this is really really hard to grok if you're basing everything on the idea of a DAG, and so many tools are that it's very natural to think you couldn't do it any other way.<p><i>There is no other way</i>. BPipe is based on the idea of a DAG. You just don't see it.<p>> In Bpipe the user declares the pipeline order explicitly.<p>And this is a <i>big mistake</i>. The reason is simple - explicit order is very hard to manage once you have multiple inputs and outputs, and as a consequence, complicated (instead of linear) dependency relationships.<p>What you don't seem to realize, is that by ""declaring the pipeline order explicitly"" <i>you create a dependency graph</i>. It's a part of your workflow definition. Your workflow contains the full definition of the dependency graph. Even if it didn't, you would still use it. There is no other way.<p>This is what I meant when I said - you create your dependency graph in ""run"". And this is a bad idea.<p>> dependencies arise as actual commands are executed.<p>What does it mean exactly? That the first command will somehow tell Bpipe what to run next? If not, then I don't understand this statement at all.<p>> How is that if it doesn't know about the dependency graph?! Well, it does it ""just in time"".<p><i>It does not matter</i> if you calculate the dependency graph before you run the first command, or as you run the commands. It makes absolutely no difference. The only difference is whether it is <i>computable</i> or not. If you say it's not computable until run-time, please elaborate on that.<p>> So in this way Bpipe handles dependencies for you.<p>So far I see that this is very standard and doesn't differ in any way from what Drake or any other tool does. The only thing that differs, and I am repeating myself, is how you define your dependency graph - through input and outputs, or in ""run"". So far it seems that ""run"" is quite unfortunate. But please give me examples.<p>> So in this way Bpipe handles dependencies for you. What it does not do is figure out which order to execute things in. It does them in exactly the order you tell it.<p>This is a meaningless statement. Drake also executes steps in the order you tell it. The only difference is <i>how</i> you tell it. In Drake, you tell it through specifying a list of steps each step depends on individually (once again, it doesn't matter that filenames are used for that - Drake also supports tags, or it could be some other identifiers). In Bpipe, you tell it in ""run"", collectively and sequentially. Drake's way supports the whole variety of graphs, while Bpipe's way - only a very limited subset. And for this limited subset, Drake can give you (I think) a syntax just as good if not better than Bpipe's. If you don't quite understand what I'm talking about, give me an example, and I will demonstrate.<p>> I actually want to control the order of things sometimes.<p>This is fine, the only question is <i>how</i>. You say Bpipe's way is <i>convenient</i>. I say give me an example and I'll show you that Drake's way is not any less convenient. I'm sorry to keep repeating myself, I thought I stressed the importance of examples quite a bit in my previous email and I want to stress it again. Examples, please!<p>> I want to be able to tell it ""do this first, then that, then the next thing"" regardless of dependencies.<p>This statement is self-contradictory. You don't seem to realize that by telling it ""do this first, then that"" you are <i>defining</i> dependencies. It's fine, and it's OK, and it can be convenient, but you can't say <i>regardless</i> of them.<p>Again - give me examples! Our conversation is becoming useless without examples.<p>You did not, but I'll just grab whatever you threw my way:<p><pre><code>    fix_names = {\n      exec ""sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $input > $output""\n    }\n\n    extract_evergreen = ...\n\n    run { fix_names + extract_evergreen }\n\n    $ bpipe run pipeline.groovy input.csv\n</code></pre>\nDrake can support this perfectly:<p><pre><code>    _ <- $[in]\n      exec ""sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $INPUT > $OUTPUT""\n\n    $[out] < _\n      ........\n\n    $ drake -v out=pipeline.groovy,in=input.csv\n</code></pre>\nIsn't that much nicer? What disadvantages you can see?<p>Tell me what is it that you would like to do with this script, and I'll tell you a better way to do it in Drake. Is it multiple versions of run that you want to have? Easy. Are you concerned about inserting a step in the middle? Trivial. Tell me why Drake's code is worse, and I'll listen. So far it seems like it's better because it's shorter and more flexible at the same time.<p>> Having the tool think this stuff up by itself can save you a bit of time but it can lose you a lot because you don't have the ability to really control what's going on.<p>What <i>exactly</i> are you losing?<p>I am sorry if I sound irritated. I am. I've just been begging for examples, and you keep talking in abstract, and it would be fine, but you're making a lot of mistakes. So, instead of looking at concrete things that would make my point apparent to you (or the opposite, prove that I'm wrong), I keep pointing to flaws in your reasoning, which frankly, is <i>irrelevant</i>.

At least, it works for me.",1359187446

Like working on a cool hobby project, having fun with friends, thinking that my work is fun.<p>Maybe your life is really boring right now, so you have reason to be frustrated.  This is good, isn't it?  This probably means you need to change something.  Obviously what you do, but maybe also your attitude.  You should rather look forward and think what you <i>can</i> do and not what you <i>could</i> have done.<p>Not sure what you are interested in, maybe you want to go rafting, learn climbing, learn Vietnamese, learn to cook food that others can eat, create a funny website, go to another country, go to the Military, run like Forest Gump through the US, or maybe walk through the US...  So much stuff to do.<p>Also stop whining, maybe you need to watch some more Clint Eastwood movies.  And in addition some documentaries about refugees in Africa or child soldiers.  Afterwards you feel more sorry for them than for you.  What also helps, talking a cold shower in the morning (or hot-cold ;)), making some push-ups, eating breakfast.  You'll feel much more vital afterwards.  (Speaking from experience.)<p>Anyway: stop comparing yourself with others and don't forget that they paid a price for being so disciplined.",1359187394
5119685,comment,5119213,5119213,3,0,svdad,,,"> Do any of you have any experience with this?<p>Um, YEAH. And just started seeing a counsellor about it. I don't think there's anything wrong with me (or you) but I want someone to talk to about it.<p>I disagree with ""Efforts taken at this point to turn things around would be futile."" I'm living proof. I bounced from job to job for 10 years, then lost a job in finance in 2007 at 33, went back to school, got out in 2010 at 35 and now have a job as a software engineer. Yeah, I'm competing with young turks 10-15 years younger than me. Yeah, sometimes they're better... but a lot of the time they aren't. It turns out I actually did learn a few things bouncing from one job to another, and people do see that.<p>Is it the best job I could have at this point in my life, am I as rich as I could be, as if I had done everything ""right""? NO. I threw away a bunch of fucking brilliant opportunities earlier in my career. But is it a good job that will give me a platform to build a satisfying career in the next 20 years? Absolutely.<p>The really hard thing for me at this point is figuring out where I really do want to go. In my case, a lot of the bad decisions were to do with ""grass is greener"" feelings -- I'd see one job that looked cooler than my current job, go out and get it, then decide it wasn't that cool and bounce to another one. So now that I've finally recognized that, where the fuck DO I want to go now, and how do I figure that out?<p>I think that's really important. Calling it ""finding your passion"" is bullshit, though, because it's not really about passion -- it's about making a sensible decision, taking everything into account including financial situation, family responsibilities, and the realities of various careers, as well as, yes, what you like to do. I'd love to be an astronaut, always wanted to, but -- life sucks -- it ain't gonna happen now. Not that it is 100% impossible, but I'm not willing to make the sacrifices it would entail. But there are great, exciting, satisfying things I can still do.<p>Another thing that's hard is making sense of the past while still keeping my focus on looking ahead to the future. That's what I'm trying to do now. I don't want to keep repeating broken patterns, so I feel like I need to think about what I've done in the past and understand it, to some extent, so I can see what I did wrong and how I can make sure not to do the same thing again. I think I've identified some of those things, but that's the main reason I'm seeing the counsellor -- I want to talk out my analyses of my past decisions and try to understand them and use my ""lessons learned"" for the future. I don't think completely ignoring everything that has gone before is right -- I did that for a long time and ended up making just the same mistakes 10 years later. But obsessing about the past is (obviously) not helpful either. It's a hard balance to strike.<p>So, you aren't alone. Very much not alone, I think. Hope you're able to make some sense of things. You can ALWAYS turn things around.",1359187355

1460109,comment,1459956,1459992,0,0,thorax,,,"When I saw the title of the blog I misread and was so excited-- thinking they finally came to their senses and were building in something like Tree-Style Tabs. It makes me so much more productive and able to coordinate so many different tabs.<p>I have 47 tabs open in Firefox currently, with trees of different research. That may seem like a lot, but it's really quite natural to manage that many with that extension. With tabs at the top, when you start getting to 15 tabs , you can't read titles and it becomes so much messier. You close stuff down just to make the current tasks simpler.<p>That extension is the primary reason I don't use Chrome for anything but a few Google services. It's so much more natural to coordinate them in FF until some other browser catches on and adds support.",1277445242

1460106,comment,1459956,1459992,0,0,po,,,"Another reason for choosing sidebar like functionality is that the number of tabs is effectively unlimited. I never understand why developers chose to use tabs for grouping lists of things that can grow unbounded. Eventually you get to a point where you are forced to:<p><pre><code>    - shrink the tabs ever smaller
    - implement scrolling of tabs(!)
    - limit creation of new tabs
    - auto close them
</code></pre>
Sidebars have none of these problems. Tabs should only be used when the number of items you have is known, limited, and ideally a small number.",1277445169

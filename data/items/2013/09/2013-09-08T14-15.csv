Therefore, that is the reason for a DE incorporation and my thoughts on using an S Corp (which I can at some point check the box and change back to a C Corp).  The &quot;credibility&quot; issue I spoke of also applies not just to investors, but bankers have also been more hesitant to loan to an LLC.  I saw this with a previous LLC entity I was a partner in.<p>Also, benefits paid to employees through an LLC are fully taxable income to them, whereas with a Corp (either S or C) they are tax deductible (for employees owning less than 2% of the company).<p>Furthermore, the stock ownership (&quot;units&quot;) situation with LLCs is awkward at best, like you said, so forget about incentive stock options and the like.

6348826,comment,6348504,6348686,15,0,s_q_b,,,"There are similar concepts in American law.<p>Some crimes, (it used to be almost all crimes, now it&#x27;s very few) require a particular state of mind, or mens rea. Mens rea, or &quot;guilty mind&quot;, is a classic precept that goes all the way back to Roman law, and would have been considered an ordinary requirement for all criminal laws at the time the Constitution was written.<p>Unfortunately, the Constitution was silent on the issue of mens rea, and the Supreme Court refused to create a universal mens rea requirement for all criminal cases under the due process clause. As a result, there are now a great deal  of &quot;strict liability&quot; crimes, which don&#x27;t require any ill intent on the part of the accused at all. For example, a car accident in some states, even absent negligence, can be grounds for felony charges.<p>Prosecutors moved for this shift during the 70s-90s, since state of mind is so difficult to prove in court. In doing so, they overturned a precedent that goes back literally two millennia. What nobody realized was that mens rea was there for a reason, that it was difficult to prove by design. As a result we see lots of prosecutions for strict liability crimes that leave the defendant at a distinct disadvantage.<p>The second defense that comes up in this context is vagueness. Since penal laws must be strictly construed in favor of the defendant, i.e. any ambiguity in interpretation open in the statute must be resolved in favor of the defendant, vague laws can be and are struck down as being void for vagueness.<p>The theory here is not that the defendant did not bother to learn the law, it is that even if he <i>had</i>, the text of the law was insufficiently clear to give adequate notice to the defendant that his actions were illegal.<p>The real problem here, however, has nothing to do with the mens rea requirement. The real problem is that we have de facto dispensed with the presumption of innocence. In today&#x27;s justice system, it is not a conviction that ruins a person&#x27;s life, it is the decision to merely to bring a charge.<p>At the moment a felony charge is filed, before any determination of guilt has been made, the defendant may be incarcerated, for as long as nine years in some jurisdictions without violating the speedy trial requirement. All of his assets may be seized, before they have been proved to be involved in a crime of any kind. He will almost certainly be expelled from educational programs, usually with little or no due process, and lose his employment.<p>All of this happens before any proof has been shown, any arguments have been heard, any witnesses have been questioned, any evidence has been challenged, and before the defendant has had the chance to utter any words other than &quot;not guilty.&quot; The fact is, in today&#x27;s American justice system, your life is effectively over at the mere pointing of a finger.<p>The checks that were supposed to be the last line of defense, probable cause hearings before neutral magistrates and Grand Juries, similarly failed. Local magistrates often work hand-in-glove with the police, often in the same building, and since the probable cause standard is so low there is little obstacle to charging anyone for anything.<p>In states that use Grand Juries, jurors often meet repeatedly with the same prosecutors, month after month. The prosecutor is the only one that can call witnesses, present evidence, make argument, and even testify. He can refuse to present exculpatory evidence and witnesses, and the defendant is not even present to respond. From this fact comes the common saying among prosecutors, &quot;I could indict a ham sandwich for the murder of a pig.&quot;<p>Most citizens are comforted by the notion, that no matter the unfairness in the initial process, eventually they will be able to present their case to a jury of their peers. However, even juries are no longer a right in most trials. Since the  federal constitution&#x27;s jury trial requirement was never incorporated against the states, most local magistrates are given the power to sentence defendants for up to six months in jail <i>per count</i>. Because most defendants face multiple charges stemming from the same conduct, there are countless American citizens spending years in jail, never having had their case heard by a jury.<p>We&#x27;ve given prosecutors the unbridled power to destroy anyone by signing a piece of paper.<p>Our justice system is just barely hanging on. Our rights still exist, but it&#x27;s becoming impossible for an average citizen to effectively assert them. It&#x27;s an interesting case to me. The decline of the legal system will be slow, and it&#x27;s still far preferable to virtually any other system I&#x27;ve studied in detail, but it&#x27;s scary to see it starting to happen.<p>The system still functions well, in some areas, especially for the rich. But the new unchecked system, (advocates would call it &quot;streamlined&quot;), pioneered upon inner city black and hispanic minorities is gradually moving up-market. Remember when you think about policies that seem to only apply to others, like loosening criminal law requirements, sovereign immunity, rampant disregard for the warrant requirement in poor neighborhoods, vehicle checkpoints, and stop-and-frisk: once the precedents are set, there is nothing to keep the government from applying them to you.",1378651378

By that you mean that there are no downsides? a hasNext()/next() often means that calling next() when there is no next element (hasNext() == false) will result in a nullpointer exception. That&#x27;s fine if you always do a hasNext() check before calling next(), but people <i>do</i> make mistakes like that. You might say that something like a loop with a hasNext() conditional is simple enough, but on the other hand I&#x27;m not too fond of even using indexing loops in Java (for (int = i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {} ) if you only need to traverse the array one item at a time; you don&#x27;t need the expressive power of indexing the array rather than simply iterating over it, and this increased power makes you more likely to introduce bugs (wrong initial value of index variable; wrong loop conditional; wrong increment operation: mixing up the indexing variables in a nested loops (the two similar-looking characters &#x27;i&#x27; and &#x27;j&#x27; are often used in that case). Even ignoring this argument, you might have to make a more complicated loop where the hasNext() or next() is a bit scattered due to some conditionals. (EDIT: since you are talking specifically about for loops this point may not be very relevant.)<p>I would say that a construct that doesn&#x27;t encapsulate enough so that you might get a runtime error is in a way worse than a construct that encapsulates enough to guarantee that that mistake can not happen at runtime. It might not be overall worse, but it <i>does</i> have a downside, IMO.",1378651194

Some parts of Soviet central planning were initially lifted almost directly from Western success stories of massively integrated industrial conglomerates, which had a data-driven central-planning ideology. Some of the late 19th-century / early 20th century American industrialists explicitly thought that the era of markets was over, because the messy, imperfect information transmission of the medieval bazaar would be finally replaced with scientific and statistical optimization of production, management, supply chains, etc., and the more centralized, the more scientific and efficient this process could be. This was a major argument against anti-trust legislation, that by breaking up the large trusts, America was only going to be sending itself backwards into an era of decentralized, uncoordinated, inefficient industrial production.<p>The Soviets pretty much agreed with the large trust owners on all these points, disagreeing only on some minor details, like ownership. There was even a vision among a certain kind of early 20th century communist (nowadays called &quot;orthodox Marxists&quot;, somewhat derisively) that capitalism was a necessary phase whose virtue lay in developing and centralizing industrial production. The communist could just wait until the capitalists have succeeded in unifying the entire industrial sector into one large conglomerate, and then the only thing left to do for a communist revolution is knock off this one remaining capitalist, who at this point owns a giant company controlling all industrial production. Then you install the party at the top of this company, and <i>voila</i>, a socialist, central-planned, scientific industrial sector!<p>Then from the 1930s American management started looking at Soviet management techniques to see if they could borrow anything back in the other direction. There were even some Soviet experiments in what today we would call &quot;gamification&quot;, which were very interesting to Western observers, and copied in various ways [1]. One way of reconciling things was to consider a model of companies being Soviet-style internally but capitalist externally: use hierarchies, internal non-monetary rewards, central optimization, etc., up to the boundaries of the company (which would ideally be very expansive boundaries), then compete past that. And I suppose now we&#x27;re at the point where using data to optimize society, another old Soviet idea, is seeming intriguing to the West...<p>[1] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2115483"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2115483</a>",1378649405

It is also because we literally do not connect our own actions with the problems or solutions, and we have a broken politics which makes many of us feel largely powerless.<p>To this mix, you add countervailing interests, who know that they need only use media and various other tactics to sow the slightest bit of confusion over an issue to freeze any meaningful mass action.<p>But, with all of this, there still seems to come a time for some things, wherein a critical mass or tipping point is reached. People mobilize and a new zeitgeist takes hold. Then it becomes comfortable, convenient, and important to be part of the solution.  I think having enough people personally affected by an issue is one impetus, and another is what forces or other voices can be galvanized to participate (even if their own motives for doing so are selfish).

AES-256 is not much slower, is it? I think I read it&#x27;s only 30 percent slower than 128-bit encryption. Either way PFS should become the default for all encrypted communications.<p>Companies need to start setting their own minimums <i>years</i> ahead of what NIST is recommending. NIST recommended the use of RSA 1024-bit until 2010, so that probably means companies should&#x27;ve moved away from RSA 1024-bit at least 3-5 years <i>earlier</i>. Yet here we are, with most companies today still using RSA 1024-bit 3 years <i>after</i> what even NIST recommended. Time to put security over profits first.<p>Also, as Ptacek is saying, it&#x27;s time to implement TACK for certificate pinning:<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/375742847485358081"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/375742847485358081</a>",1378648881

The problem you are describing is well known and in your hospital&#x27;s IT queue, just so low on the list to be invisible.<p>As others have rightly pointed out, the technical issues are perhaps 10% of the problem. On top of that, because each EHR is configured so differently, your solution will be a consulting effort not a product (read: expensive)<p>My suggestion - thoroughly evaluate how difficult this would be to get approval for at your hospital. If you get past this stage, talk to other hospitals. Learn what the implementation process will be at each hospital. This will likely dissuade you but, if not, you&#x27;ve found a niche.<p>The reality is that this is not an IT problem but a process flow problem. Somebody with a lower pay grade should be entering this data, say an MA or a 1st year resident, until the IT team can prioritize this known issue.",1378648800

10929417,comment,10928020,10928773,0,0,cmarschner,,,"A kid&#x27;s emotions are actually tightly linked to cost (or rather: fitness) functions: it gets fascinated by things it just barely cannot do. Somehow it &quot;knows&quot; that it could learn it and gets drawn to it. It gets bored by things it can do already, and frustrated by matters that are too hard. I think there&#x27;s a pattern - emotions are a device for steering the system as a whole in a certain direction that increases its (or rather: its genes&#x27;) chance of survival - finding a mate, finding food, adapting to the environment. They are one of the devices used for increasing our chance to create offspring, even in places where we don&#x27;t expect them. For example there is this study where people around the world were asked in detail what kind of art they would find most beautiful (there&#x27;s a TED talk about it): basically, across the globe, from Greenland to Sahara, it was a landscape with lush greens and a waterhole: a place where food would ve abundant. \nThis system is highly adaptive - e.g. if you look at how beauty ideals have changed over the centuries: the 16th century &quot;Rubens type&quot; signalled fitness in a way that we would call &quot;overweight&quot; today. A skinny model from today wouldn&#x27;t have drawn the attention of Rubens&#x27; contemporaries. So perhaps we have an innate mechanism to recognize fitness within the local context, and we are drawn to it.\nI think one problem of computer scientists working on the problem might be that they are often not self aware about their own emotions. Perhaps we should have more painters and fashion designers amongst us to understand the topic.",1453193099

I wonder if it is sensible to limit the number of refreshes permitted (by placing a counter in the JWT that gets decreased on every refresh). That way you could have the JWT be valid for, say, 30 minutes, and allow up to seven refreshes; after four hours you would have to re-authenticate.<p>As for invalidating tokens; if tokens expire after a sensible interval (as they should), than you would only have to maintain a short list of recently issued and invalidated tokens. Older tokens can be removed from that list, because they cannot be used in any case after expiring. You could use a cache with a TTL set to a bit over the configured expiration interval.",1453193044

On OS X you have to use the function thread_policy_set and on Windows SetThreadAffinityMask, all with different logics.<p>The other problem is once you play with affinity you have to take care of <i>all</i> the threads of your application because if you leave one thread roaming on all cores your affinity approach is ruined.<p>Making sure that different steps of the same operation are processed in the same logical thread makes a bigger performance difference than playing with thread affinity.<p>Last but not least, the code in this article is incorrect.

What is not normal, is that countries like France will persecute the 99 other ones, and even put them in prison, because they are unable to keep paying taxes and contributions now that their project has failed. Since none of the 100 starters knew if they would be the lucky one, they feel it is too risky to try. They are right, and the risk that they are trying to avoid, is created by the government.<p>There is a reason why governments prefer large companies, don&#x27;t like small companies, and discourage starting one. If a large company employs 1000 persons, they only need to speak to 1 person to collect taxes on all 1000. It would be a problem, if they had to collect them from each individual person one by one, from all 1000. Large companies make life easier to them. So, they discourage people from being self-employed or create small companies. One way to do that, is to punish them harshly if they fail.<p>The biggest problem that the government has, is that their policy is actually working. Nobody wants to start a new company. With old companies gradually becoming outdated and disappearing, that is not such a good thing.

It&#x27;s only the last-resort you need to go to so if it&#x27;s a huge blob of encrypted data that shouldn&#x27;t matter too much -- you only need to access that in case of a total disaster where you lost all your own backup endpoints first.<p>> And I don&#x27;t pay the overhead of an add-on service.<p>The reason I&#x27;m asking is because I was under the impression that backup services are much <i>cheaper</i> than pure storage, while still offering some conveniences such as versioning/backup apps. Glacier charges $0.007 per GB per month, that&#x27;s $7/month just for a single 1TB machine, just for a single version (If my math is correct, it&#x27;s early)! If you have dozens of versions it quickly adds up.<p>I do 10 machines at around 1TB on average, unlimited storage in unlimited versions, at $1.25 per machine per month (flat rate, regardless of storage volume). I have tried building my own machines, tried looking at storage providers etc., but can&#x27;t get near.<p>Even if I did only 1-2 machines, the cost in Glacier would break the backup service cost already at a couple of TB total storage.",1453190611

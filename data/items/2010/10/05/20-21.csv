Unfortunately, you might actually be fighting a war that looks more like the downfall of the Roman empire than the liberation you seem to think you'll achieve. This isn't really a winnable strategy, even if you win the actual conflict.<p><i>For the vast majority of history winning wars didn't rely on winning the hearts and minds of anyone, it relied on the complete destruction and subjugation of the other faction.</i><p>History shows that wars without a clear decisive outcome tend to drag on for generations. ""Most wars"" did exactly that. The fact that WWII did have such an clear outcome does not make it the norm, even with the idea of ""total domination"".<p>Wars of ideas(opposed to those over resources and/or land) don't end until one of the ideas goes out of fashion. The cold war is a perfect example of this. That stalemate ended because the <i>communists</i> didn't think their ideas would work. It had little to do with how many nukes the west could muster.<p>In the same light, radical Islam - I could argue Islam/religion itself - can only be ""defeated"" when the Islamics themselves decide that the particular path that they are on isn't worth the struggle. People turn to religion - any religion - when their needs are not being met. This is true even in the West - the Catholic church was the supreme authority during the dark ages, when Europe was suffering, and the Muslim world was enjoying a much less religious but more established existence a few miles away.<p>Fulfill the needs of the person to a basic level and religion offers nothing. You cannot win a war of ideas until you kill the idea, not the person.",1286312182

This is similar to <i>Surface</i>, which is (I believe) another variation on Windows Presentation Layer (everywhere).<p>Don't get me wrong, silverlight is compelling to any .net developer because it's pretty easy to pick up and get results fast. I just wish MS would make the web less muddy by NOT adding to the confusing with something that is more or less already handled by Flash. There just isn't any need for it in that space (the web versus win phone 7, surface, etc).<p>In the long run I'm sure you are right, it's not like Silverlight is going to be 'canceled', I just wish they would come to there senses about its use as a web plug-in.",1286312179

There would hypothetically be no terrorists left, and everyone would work very hard not to be grouped in with those countires, otherwise they're going to get nuked too.<p>It sounds crazy (and I certainly don't condone that strategy), but realize that is one of the other options. For the vast majority of history winning wars didn't rely on winning the hearts and minds of <i>anyone</i>, it relied on the complete destruction and subjugation of the other faction.<p>You could say ""this war is different"", but it really is not. It is different than the West on West wars of the last 3 centuries, but it is no different than a lot of guerilla wars in the past. The Native Americans tried really hard to stop Americans from expanding into their land - and the US won that guerilla war by just excersizing extreme cruelty.<p>Trying to win hearts and minds is a losing strategy against an opponent who doesn't care about that at all. The terrorists are not trying to win our hearts and minds, they are trying to kill as many Americans as possible. That makes their goals a lot easier to achieve.<p>Can we really invade every single country that holds some people that want us dead and ""meet them face to face"". Hell no, that would require conquering the whole world, which is impossible even for the US. The other option is making an example of a country and dissuading every other country from allowing terrorists to exist inside their borders, lest they end up like country X or Y that was conquered by the US.<p>Unfortunately by bungling in Iraq and forgetting about Afghanistan, the US ends up just looking weak. The reality is that the biggest obstacle to total victory is the lack of support for the level of violence required to win a war like this. The American people just won't stomach anywhere near the level of damage inflicted on the opponent in World War 1 or 2.<p>Thus with ""total domination"" off of the play book, we have ""ignore borders and start dropping hellfire missiles on people no matter where they are"" as a the current method for dealing with people.

It's called cache invalidation and it's a hard problem to solve in a general way.<p>SSDs are just a midpoint in the performance trade-off game.<p>The OS is the worst at this, DBs are somewhat better, but realistically if you want serious performance out of your application you need to make those choices for yourself, and use all strategies where appropriate RAM for records you need instantly (memcache,redis,mongodb) SSDs for the stuff you can't afford to keep on an SSD And hard drives for stuff you can't afford to keep on an SSD.<p>What you need to think about is the value of your data in dollars per IO/sec per DB ($/(IO/sec/GB), if the amortized value of that data exceeds the amortized cost of the retrieval system then buy it. Focus on increasing the value of your data, not reducing the costs of it's retrieval as that will drop by 1/2 every 18 months anyway. Alternatively, change your business model so you are going short on IO/sec/GB, (eg. pre-sell storage so that when you need to buy it you can do so cheaply)<p>What I'm trying to say is that the value of a picture is worth more to Flickr than it is to Facebook, thus Flickr will have an easier time building it's retrieval systems than Facebook because of the costs involved. That's why Facebook had to write their own filesystem for retrieving pictures.<p>I'd bet that any commercial DB will blow rings around redis/mongo/etc if you had your persistent store as a RAM disk and used hard drives for the transaction log.

To assume that powerful, rapidly growing companies will be less likely to emerge is silly. Ego, or boldness, or vision, or some other human emotion will continue to instill a drive and eagerness within founders to grow and expand. They may have 2-3 or more small company sales before they do it, but that intrinsic drive to build will still remain.

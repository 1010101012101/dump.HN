It's not possible to visualize. Nobody knows what they ""look"" like, because there is no known algorithm to construct the five pieces. There is merely a proof that they exist, and that they are infinitely complicated little pieces. If you get everything before that, and you get everything after that, you actually get everything. The Axiom of Choice is basically the official mathematician version of ""And magic happens here..."". (I'm being glib, it's better characterized than that, but there's a large kernel of truth there.)<p>(I'm not ""against"" the Axiom of Choice, but I think it should always be clear when it is necessary, as I think the division between ""proofs that might mean something in the real world"" and ""not"" is a division worth keeping track of, even if mathematicians aren't supposed to care about such mundane matters.)",1255228532

But, if I'm Zappos, Amazon, or any other online retailer, I don't want Plurchase -- or any other service -- hijacking my website via their own proxy, for any reason, and/or redefining my customer's experiences in any way.<p>And when the Plurchase team approaches online retailers and gives them ten reasons why allowing Plurchase to do this will ultimately help the retailer make more money, they are going to be met with a wall of skepticism, and rightly so.<p>It's always easy to rationalize how your ideas (that primarily benefit you) will benefit others too, but actually getting other people to agree with your passion and sign on with your business model is an entirely different story.<p>My 2 cents!",1255227803

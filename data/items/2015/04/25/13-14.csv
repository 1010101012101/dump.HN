These satisfy the unambiguous distributive axiom, real * (el_1 + el_2) = real * el_1 + real * el_2. Since addition only applies to elements, real * el_1 and real * el_2 <i>must</i> be computed into elements first before the sum. While this doesn&#x27;t strictly, logically imply the same for real * real + real * real, it&#x27;s at least suggestive (hence the e.g.) and you can turn to the Peano Arithmetic axioms and definitions of addition and multiplication and do the same thing for natural numbers. Or you can just say the ordering implied by assuming PEMDAS, but just saying that alone is boring and doesn&#x27;t really expose the elegance in notation/algebraic transformation gained from such a convention.<p>(For those who don&#x27;t get the reference, every so often some variant of &quot;a + b * 0 + c = ?&quot; will show up in the public&#x27;s attention and receive very emotional arguments about how it must be 0, or must be a+c, or must be c, or it must be ambiguous and therefore undefined.

I said:<p>> JavaScript was made in like a weekend and copied Java badly<p>The original author knocked out JavaScript&#x27;s overall design in a weekend, then they tried to shoehorn in Java-like features badly. That&#x27;s why we have artifacts like the Date() having month at 0 (like Java). They took a whole bunch of Java concepts and tried to clone them into JS after the naming.<p>My post would have made more sense if you understood a little more about JavaScript&#x27;s history (both before and after naming). There was definitely a sense of making it more Java-y after it was named that.<p>> It&#x27;s an extremely functional language<p>No, it just isn&#x27;t. JavaScript has state all over the darn place. I mean heck it has a global scope with no namespaces at all, that alone is a death nail on calling anything a &quot;functional language.&quot; I have no way of writing a function in JavaScript which makes a guarantee that it has no internal state, so the optimiser cannot make assumptions about that function either (e.g. inlining it).

RAID and bootloaders raised a few issues for example. We got everything working eventually, but the amount of wasted time even with very experienced sysadmins looking after some of those machines was silly.<p>Debian is generally very good with stability for things like security updates and we certainly plan to continue using it. However, our plans for updating this time are more along the lines of &quot;set up completely new machine with Debian 8 from the start, install our own choice of packages and applications, and then systematically migrate data/connectivity from the old systems to the new ones&quot;. We expect the time and money costs of having the transition period to be less than the potential downtime if direct upgrades take as much effort as they did from 6 to 7.<p>Your mileage may vary, Linux has infinite possibilities and ours may just have been unlucky, the plural of anecdote is not data, etc.",1429969649

McBride wants to share with you his new toy demonstrating how many neat ideas can fit together nicely. Bauer and Pretnar are also trying to talk about the general idea of &quot;algebraic effect handlers&quot;.<p>Anyway, the big differences between Frank and Eff is that Frank (a) invents its own syntax while Eff just more or less steals ML&#x27;s and (b) Frank also includes a very interesting &quot;evaluation order&quot; called Call-by-Push-Value.<p>CBPV is kind of comparable to things like Call by Name and Call by Value, &quot;non-strict&quot; and &quot;strict&quot; evaluation orders. Really, however, it&#x27;s not comparable. When you have a lambda calculus you have a little bit of ambiguity between evaluation orders---there&#x27;s a question, should you use CBV or CBN? CBPV is an elaboration of the lambda calculus where that choice no longer remains as it has been made explicitly in the syntax and you can switch between them as you like. Another way of seeing it is that you can translate (Lambda Calculus + CBN) or (Lambda Calculus + CBV) into CBPV but you cannot directly translate (Lambda Calculus) alone due to the ambiguity I mentioned---CBPV won&#x27;t tolerate that.<p>So what Frank is showing is that CBPV is a neat way of building a language and that it works very nicely with algebraic effects, in fact, since a side effect of CBPV is to make segments of code where &quot;computation&quot; occurs very distinct from places where &quot;values are described&quot;. Side effects, as it turns out, only show up during computation so you can recognize larger segments of you code which you just don&#x27;t have to worry about side effecting at all.",1429968943

9438245,comment,9437880,9437880,0,0,jhwhite,,,"I&#x27;ve gone through something similar.<p>Back in 2012 this happened:<p>>I interviewed for a job in Austin. I had 2 phone interviews, a 7 hour in person interview with at least 10 different people including the CIO, VP&#x27;s, directors, and team members, then a follow-up interview with a senior person. Then I hear NOTHING again. I call for a follow-up and leave a message and they don&#x27;t return my call. So I just assume they hired someone else. I just get a call from a head hunter trying to fill the position that I interviewed for. Obviously the company is still looking and glad to have some closure (I apparently wasn&#x27;t what they were looking for) but kinda disappointed that they didn&#x27;t call me to tell me themselves.<p>A friend of mine got a little fired up about it and replied to my Facebook post:<p>>I think that is ridiculous! Sometimes I wonder who raised these people because it is NOT hard to send a couple-sentence email saying &quot;Thanks for applying. We have chosen another candidate. We&#x27;ll keep you in mind in the future.&quot; Heck - I&#x27;d rather get an email saying &quot;F-U&quot; than NOTHING. I know &quot;they&quot; think there are sooooo many applicants that they don&#x27;t have to show people common decency, but it&#x27;s JUST PLAIN RUDE. The reality is you may be looking for a job from them right now, but one day they may be wanting your business or looking for a job themselves when they get laid off or fed up; their company may be bought by one you own or even just work for; they may be on the &quot;needy&quot; side of the equation one day, and you won&#x27;t forget how poorly they behaved. What if you weren&#x27;t right for this opening, but they want you for something else in the future? Or what if they thought you weren&#x27;t perfect, but they just never find perfect and decide they DO want you? Do they just think because you need a job you will completely forget about all of that? Even if they never need anything from you in their lives, I don&#x27;t know how people sleep at night knowing that people like you are out there, just wondering what happened, at their mercy. {O.K. Apparently, I got a little fired up.} I don&#x27;t know...fine if they don&#x27;t want to hire you; fine if they don&#x27;t have time to spend hours telling you what would have made their decision different; NOT fine to not respond at all. Period. Silver lining: Just be glad you DIDN&#x27;T get hired because you would have found out what they were really like when it was too late!!!",1429968292

It&#x27;s a vital part of risk management and a healthy market. Some markets do have minimum quote lives, but they typically fail as market makers cannot manage risk there, so trading moves elsewhere. The only time I&#x27;ve seen a market place survive adding MQL&#x27;s is when they were on the order of milliseconds, not minutes.<p>There are certainly strategies that are manipulative. For example, having a hidden order on the ask and posting an inflated bid then pulling it once your ask gets filled. Since you posted it with no intention to get filled and with the intention of manipulating the price, that&#x27;s spoofing, and illegal.<p>But the fact that someone placed an order and then canceled it when the price got close means exactly nothing -- everyone does it as a part of normal business.",1429968186

You&#x27;re adding surface area, yes, but not that much, and you can easily compensate by being more careful with windows and avoiding wasteful features like bumpouts &c.<p>On a 35*50 (1750 sq. ft) single level house, you&#x27;re adding 170 ft of exterior wall to an envelope that had 1360 sq. ft of walls and 1750 sq. ft of ceiling giving directly on outdoors, or 5.4%. Given a &quot;code&quot; insulation level of R-20, it would mean adding less than an inch of insulation to compensate.<p>I suspect the builders from warmer climates simply didn&#x27;t build correctly for the climate: not enough insulation, problematic details. You get issues whenever builders move from one climate to another, because many of them just don&#x27;t care enough to learn about how to adapt houses to their new climate.

For the latter point, there is now a LTS project, which provides +2 year after offical support ends, but they only support squeeze for now (since wheezy is on offical support and jessie is not released) and AFAIK it&#x27;s not decided yet if jessie will be supported by LTS or not. So it may extend to 2020.<p>If you want certainty on this regard Ubuntu LTS is also a pretty good choice.<p>On CentOS, I don&#x27;t use it so I can&#x27;t comment on it in depth, but beware that number of offically supported packages are much smaller compared to Debian, so make sure the packages you want to use are supported. (There are semi-offical/unoffical repositories, but they may not be maintained as well as offical packages.)

9438207,comment,9436553,9436553,0,0,design-of-homes,,,"I live in the UK, and the tiny house movement appears to be a uniquely American phenomenon. The US is lucky to have so much open space which lets people build their own homes. The reason these tiny homes don&#x27;t feel cramped is because they&#x27;re surrounded by nature, with beautiful long uninterrupted views out of the windows. No noisy neighbours or traffic nearby either.<p>But take away the countryside location of these homes and could the tiny house work in an urban environment? I&#x27;m doubtful. The future for housing for most people on the planet (including the US) is in cities and urban environments. Can you live in a tiny home where you don&#x27;t have long, uninterrupted views out of your windows? Or where you only have windows along one side of your dwelling (e.g. single-aspect apartments). Do you feel you have enough privacy when your apartment or house is joined with your neighbours&#x27; home?<p>Millions of people already live in homes like this and have to contend with these issues. The challenge for homebuilders and architects is to design housing to address these issues: homes that give us light, space, privacy, quiet and comfort in a noisy urban setting. Sadly, if I look at the new build housing going up in the UK I&#x27;d say architects and house builders are doing a pretty poor job of it. Are things better in the US in this regard?<p>Also, space can be &#x27;modest&#x27; in size rather than micro or miniature and still be sustainable or amenable to high density. For example, London has it&#x27;s own housing design guide that recommends new one bedroom apartments for <i>two people</i> to be a minimum of 50 square metres (538 square feet). That&#x27;s still less than space standards in continental Europe but it&#x27;s enough space to live comfortably even if it doesn&#x27;t count as tiny by Western standards.",1429967090

4462894,comment,4462864,4462864,11,0,lutusp,,,"This issue is much easier to resolve than by way of the thousands of words the article's author used.<p>What a layman calls ""skepticism"", a scientist called the ""null hypothesis."" The null hypothesis says that an idea with no supporting evidence is assumed to be false. So in science, and to a skeptic, until there's evidence, there's no justification for taking an idea seriously.<p>To someone not trained in science (the ""sheep""), an idea is true until there's contrary evidence. To a scientist (the ""goat"") by contrast, an idea is false util there's supporting evidence.<p>A sheep believes in Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, and UFO visitations only because these ideas haven't been disproven, but <i>they cannot be disproven</i> -- that would require proof of a negative, an impossible evidentiary burden. This explains most of the really weird things people believe.<p>The remedy is skepticism, a healthy intellectual posture that awaits evidence. That's why I'm still a skeptic.",1346482740

All the failures of desktop GNU/Linux have been solved, or are not relevant, in mobile GNU/Linux.<p>Well, mobile is not for productivity, or even for typing a long email. How many people you know that haven't got a laptop or desktop, except grandmas? What kind of programs do typical people use on millions of Android phones?<p>>Regarding the tablet segment of mobile, one could argue that GNU/Linux will seize the low end and gradually gain market share at the expense of iPad, leaving no room for Microsoft.<p>What? Android tablets are not selling very well and are getting crushed by the iPad. Meanwhile, Surface seems to be the only device ready to take on the iPad by the horns, the rest are cheap imitations of the iPad but really cheap since Apple has a tight supply chain. Not to mention that a 7"" iPad will take away some of the low end market you're talking about. So that's a rather silly argument to make.<p>>The only reason I care about desktop OS at all is to develop for mobile or back-end server.<p>What about laptops? Are they ""mobile""?

Even if Yoshikazu makes the same level of sushi it will still be seen as inferior. If Yoshikazu makes sushi that's twice as good as Jiro's, only then will they be seen as equal.""

4462846,comment,4462656,4462656,3,0,atpaino,,,"The only way I can really see a big-box chain like Best Buy surviving alongside Amazon and the other online retailers is if they were to focus heavily on training their employees to be knowledgeable on all the products they are selling, similar to Apple's ""Geniuses"". I think the original problem stores like Best Buy were created to solve no longer exists - namely, a _physical_ one-stop shop for all your electronic needs. Amazon is clearly better for this.<p>Where I see opportunity for Best Buy to differentiate is in customer experience. When the typical consumer decides they want to buy a new laptop, and don't want a mac, they basically have a couple of options. They can either research laptops on their own (through Amazon, Engadget, et al) or they can just drive to a Best Buy store and buy whatever the employee tells them. The thing is, the Best Buy option really isn't much better currently because their average employee isn't very knowledgeable on the laptops they carry.<p>For this to work, Best Buy would have to both pay employees more and spend more time/money training them.

Other competing scripting might be good (like lua) but I haven't used them. I do know however Ruby and Python are better.<p>see\n<a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/ancient-languages-perl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/ancient-languages-...</a><p>90% still holds true. This guy knows more than 99% of the Perl advocates on this thread (he's also smarter than me). Do another search on other famous programmers (like Rob Pike) and almost always you'll find negative comments about Perl. There a reason companies like google use Python and universities (like MIT) teach in Python.<p>For crying out loud Perl has pointers in it. Perl doesn't do basic parameter checking in functions. Perl doesn't come with a decent repl. The Perl repl doesn't work with readlines. Perl doesn't do sane type checking. print ""abc"" + 1; prints 1. It isn't a syntax error (like in Ruby or Python). Do some basic google searching. wantarray is one of most horrible things I've seen a programming language thats unique to Perl. You how know generally side effects are bad in functions? Well, I don't want to get into it... but just google it.<p>Perl has a weird cult culture to it. There are a few smart people who are really into it but it isn't because of the languages merits. This is well described by one of perl most famous developers:\n<a href=""http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/12/advocacy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/12/advocacy.html</a>\nNo one with a OPEN mind who isn't lazy wouldn't move onto Python or Ruby.<p>Remember too at the end of the day it is how good or bad code theoretically is. Is what you see out in the wild. What you work with. The chances are you won't be looking at chromatic's code. Perl code is about the ugliest, most unreadable code you'll find on average. I recently saw something Brain D Foy (a Perl expert) acknowledging this. The average code is what counts.<p>Anyhow those are my 2 cents. I have to go to sleep.",1346480245

You don't <i>know</i> what an animal is feeling, in the sense that you don't <i>know</i> other minds exist, but I think when animal behavior makes emotional sense, it's appropriate to interpret it that way.<p>Nor do I think it's that farfetched that birds should feel grief.  A lot of animals display emotions that I identify with.  I've seen pride and humiliation and saving face in cats.  And dogs obviously feel joy and worry and mourning.<p>I understand the need to distinguish between what's likely and what's proven, but I also don't see a reason for the explanation to be complex.  It looks like grief.  I think it's more likely to be that than some alien phenomenon that happens to look like it.",1346480050

Please don't call that giving him options.<p><i>the originating inventor should also always be in a position to negotiate fees for their patent from parties that licence it, including their own employer</i><p>There are usually multiple inventors. If 3 people invent it, do each of them get a 1/3 vote on it?  Do all 3 need to agree on a license? Do each of them get 1/3 of the claims?  Can any of the 3 license it individually (which means that the price will naturally fall to $0 since you can always take your business to one of the other two)?<p>You are creating a brand new problem that was solved long ago. The solution is for those 3 inventors to assign or sell their invention to a company that they form. The company owns and licenses the patent, and those 3 inventors can sell or trade their shares in the company as they wish.<p>This desire to interfere in trade is very odd. If I have something worth $100 to me, but $500 to my neighbor, the ability to trade creates wealth.

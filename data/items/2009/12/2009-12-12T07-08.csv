So I have a lot of experience with Border Patrol (at least on the Rainbow Bridge -- I avoided the other ones since I figured they would be nicer at the one most tourists would use).<p>Canadian Border Patrol:<p>* Very professional<p>* Demeanor ranges from 'stone cold' to 'polite and pleasant' (in some cases 'warm' too)<p>* <i>Once</i> had an asshole of a Canadian Border Patrol guy that said my story was 'confusing' and that 'it takes a lot' to confuse him. (In a total, ""I'm talking down at you because I'm a law enforcement officer that needs always project authority"" sort of way)<p>* I once was in front of some people that got turned back from the Canadian border (one of them wasn't a US citizen and was trying to use a Driver's License as ID to cross the border) and at no point did I feel that the border people were acting like assholes to the couple trying to cross.<p>US Border Patrol:<p>* ""military police with a chip on their shoulder""<p>* One time I had a border patrol guy get pissed at me because he accidentally set off the car alarm (he asked me to hand him my key fob, and he pressed the f-cking red button on it).<p>* One time I had a US Border Patrol officer try to crack a joke with me about a recent local suicide (it happened at the casino I worked at). It was in total bad taste... and I'm someone that finds humor in crap on 4chan /b/. I just kinda nodded to get through the border (and because the casino didn't want us talking about it at all either).<p>* One time I was almost pulled out of my car because they confused ""I work at the casino"" with ""I won at the casino."" The guy asked me how much money I had on me, and got pissed off when I told him, ""I dunno, maybe $5 in change."" (The odd thing about this was that he and his 'partner' were wandering around through the mess of cars backed up over the bridge <i>going into Canada</i> . They were US Border Patrol Officers, why are they patrolling the people going into Canada?)<p>Overall, I've only ever had my car searched 2 or 3 times (all by US Border Patrol as a US citizen). (One of those times I kinda agreed with the search even though they told me it was a 'random' search. I had gone across the border to deliver a present because it would be faster than shipping it. When asked how long my stay in Canada was I replied, ""about 20 minutes."" The reply I got was, ""You've been randomly selected for a search. Pull around to the spot over there and take this slip with you.""... At least they could be honest and say that I was suspicious...)",1260604735

He spent the next three years on a fishing boat catching mackerel, sardines and squid, an experience he described as ""an anthropological field study.""<p>After publishing a book about life in the fishing village, Mr. Irish landed a job writing a column, in Japanese, for a local Kagoshima newspaper.

He said maybe you shouldn't do it <i>and</i> you might get caught.

991285,comment,991012,991246,0,0,pyre,,,"The best explanation is this:<p>Law enforcement of any kind (police up to military) are trained to be 'in control' of their situation. When you start asking questions (or getting out of your car or whatever) you are being proactive for yourself. You're trying to take control of a situation so that you understand what's going on and that you don't have to accept everything at face value. But this contradicts all of their training that they need to control the situation. Even though you might be unarmed and they are armed (meaning that no matter how verbal you might get they still have control... they can f-cking kill you) they react to gain complete and utter control over the situation.<p>I'm not saying I like this. To be truthful, I absolutely hate this. But it is the way it is. Their training is f-cked. (or at least there are a majority of people that take the training past the point of (un)common sense).",1260602143

Time is different now. What I have learned from my second and successful startup is that entrepreneurs need to defy Silicon Valley VC myths. Instead of innovating, we need to ""nanovate"". Instead of vision, we need to have peripheral vision. Instead of thinking outside of the box, we need to think inside the box. Instead of supersizing our business with VC money, we need to sacrifice growth by making sure that our early-adopter customers are extremely happy. VC's always want us to aim high, but for bootstrapping entrepreneurs, it is best to shot low. Focus on our current customer base and make sure everyone is happy. The cost of acquiring a new customer is extremely high in a down market. A perfect defense is our only offense. We must ignore our competitors and focus exclusively on our existing customers. Don't look for the knee of the hockey stick. Instead, wait for the pivot that would get us onto a different game. No sailboat ever won a contest by staying in the dry dock.

991281,comment,990920,991020,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"The only thing that (finally) got them to accelerate the roll out of DSL in Illinois was Comcast and the other cable companies beginning to eat their lunch.<p>After 6 years in a community of several hundred residences less than two miles from a town that does have DSL service, they still couldn't be bothered to drop in a local junction (I'm forgetting my terminology; whatever box it is that can take the place of a local switching center these days in providing DSL service) so that I and my neighbors would be within what they consider an acceptable range for service.  This was a couple of years ago; I haven't bothered to check since.<p>A few towns further downstate finally got so frustrated that they made plans to roll their own connectivity.  AT&T took them to court and lobbied the state legislature to prevent them from proceeding.<p>Back before my last move, I had DSL from SBC (maybe at that time still Ameritech/SBC; and which has since purchased the AT&T name).  Phoning up to place the order, the call was answered within a few seconds.  Installation itself took three scheduled visits, each requiring a half-day window of my availability (so, off from work), before someone actually showed up to fill the order.  Then, they did an absolute crap job, leaving a bare wire-to-wire connection hanging on the ouside of the building.  My downstairs neighbor had a friend stop by who was an actual line technician for the telephony part of SBC.  That fellow was kind enough to go up and clean up and tape over that connection, as a favor to his friend.  Turns out the DSL installers they were sending out were subcontractors.<p>After that, connectivity would go down frequently.  When it was up, traceroute would show a <i>blank</i>-awful lot of bouncing around SBC servers (sometimes close to 10, perhaps more) before a request escaped to the internet.  One time when I called for service, I reached a nice support tech who was at the point of boiling over (at the situation, not me).  She described how they were subcontractors who filed tickets that were then serviced by other subcontractors (IIRC).  When people called up, there was literally nothing more she could do than file a ticket, and she could get no further feedback on the status of that ticket.<p>I ended up spending about thirty minutes talking to her as she calmed down.  It didn't matter with respect to her keeping her job; she'd decided to leave her position the following week.  I feel a little guilty that this tied her up, but she just needed someone to vent to after banging her head against the proverbial wall of SBC tech support for too long.<p>SBC, now AT&T, is one of the few companies I have an immediate aversion to giving any business whatsoever.  I know some individual employees who are just fine.  But management, particularly senior management and the policies they promulgate, are simply evil.<p>I hesitate a bit to post this.  HN generally isn't a place I consider griping appropriate.  But this company's behavior serves such an exemplary role of how <i>not</i> to do business (unless you are a de facto regional monopoly (as they were at that time) and part of a national oligarchy), that it is perhaps instructional.<p>Oh, and it's been a while, but IIRC SBC was given many millions of dollars in concessions and dismissal of legal charges, in return for their agreement, among other things, to accelerate and thoroughly roll out statewide high speed Internet (DSL).  The above description is an example of how they failed to honor this commitment.  Instead, they spent their time lobbying the state legislature to have the terms of the agreement altered to exempt them from having to honor it.  One example of another lesson demonstrated repeatedly in the state and region: Such concessions, tax breaks, etc. rarely pay off for the states and communities that make them.<p>I have no great love for any of the major telcos, nor the major cable companies (shudder), but the Death Star is in a class unto itself.",1260601657

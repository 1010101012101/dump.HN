Or change it to &quot;where a character is a Unicode codepoint&quot;.<p>This is basically saying Python uses a fixed-length encoding (UTF-32) where each codepoint takes constant storage, as opposed to UTF-8 where the storage of a character depends on where it is in the Unicode plane. A useful analog, if you know C, is that Python always uses wchar_t[] where each element is a character, while rust uses char[] and then the elements are not characters but UTF-8 bytes.<p>There are obvious up- and downsides to both approaches.<p>EDIT: As suggested by two children, with Python 3.3+, the fixed-length encoding Python uses depends on the highest codepoint in the string and is often not UTF-32. With earlier versions there are &quot;narrow&quot; and &quot;wide&quot; builds which use UTF-16 and UTF-32 respectively.",1432723638

But things are always simple and nice in the beginning, when you are focusing on just a small part of the complete picture.<p>The problem with &#x27;simple&#x27; is that unless it abstracts away all complexity you&#x27;ll ever need to deal with, you&#x27;ll need to do a lot of work yourself: it&#x27;s the typical RISC/CISC argument from yesteryear: do you want a small instruction set which is simple but results in a longer program, or a complex large instruction set which results in a smaller program?<p>So, to be able to deal with all possible complexity in all possible scenarios, either the language has to be vast in its expressiveness (go isn&#x27;t) or it has to come with a vast standard library which offers additional expressiveness through classes / methods / functions / subsystems or whatever the language is lacking, OR you have to write it all yourself.<p>In the end, the net-result is the same: the system as the end result of your work is the combined complexity of the code written by the developer(s) and the complexity of the libraries used. Go doesn&#x27;t change that, it just moves the divider between &#x27;own code&#x27; and &#x27;libraries&#x27; more towards &#x27;own code&#x27;, even if that&#x27;s simpler to write because the language lacks things which some people might consider &#x27;oh god this is complex, I&#x27;ll never understand this&#x27;.",1432723462

What you actually did was first make the claim you are now repeating, and then, when I pointed out that doing so completely contradicted your original position, you changed your mind and decided that Eslaught&#x27;s explanation was irrelevant (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9433742"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9433742</a>). Now that I have asked on what grounds you consider it to be irrelevant, you have circled back around to your original position, creating a lose-lose situation in which you have contradicted yourself regardless of what your actual opinion is.<p>You have reached the point of creating epicycles of contradictions within contradictions, as all this is going on within your larger contradiction of first claiming inordinate complexity of any alternative to your approach and then trying to rewrite that as being merely a claim that there is necessarily some slight increment in complexity in avoiding C++. Let&#x27;s look again at what you actually wrote:<p>&quot;Sure you could do it that way.

Now that Rust is post-1.0, we will see.<p>> the constant encoding and decoding you have to deal with in Python just to support O(1) string indexing.<p>Strictly speaking, Python also doesn&#x27;t support a complete character indexing, because it works on code point basis. O(1) string indexing is largely a myth.[1] But I&#x27;m sure that the author definitely knows about this, considering his previous rants on Python&#x27;s Unicode handling. ;)<p>Regarding Unicode handling, I think Swift&#x27;s `String` type is arguably more complete than Rust or Python. Its internal representation is UTF-16, possibly due to the interoperability concerns with `NSString`, so it can&#x27;t compete with Rust on the performance aspect. However, it indexes a string by grapheme cluster (so Swift&#x27;s `Character` type is actually a slice, not an integer) and compares the characters by their normalized forms, which eliminates many mistakes that can be made by careless programmers, including me. Of course the same thing can be done in other languages using external libraries, but the official support residing in the built-in string type is very nice to have.<p>[1] <a href=""https://hamstergene.github.io/post/wchar-is-useless/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hamstergene.github.io/post/wchar-is-useless/</a>",1432721878

The Bank for International Settlements estimates that the volume of collateral supporting the OTC market is about $1.8 trillion, thus roughly only half of exposures. Assuming a collateral reuse rate between 2.5-3.0, the dedicated collateral is some $600 - $700 billion. Some counterparties (e.g., sovereigns, quasi-sovereigns, large pension funds and insurers, and AAA corporations) are often not required to post collateral.

Let&#x27;s assume that the Supreme Court decides not to take the appeal, so the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that APIs are copyrightable stands.<p>What courts is this precedent for?<p>Generally, the way precedent works is that if appeals from court X go to court Y, then the decisions of court Y are precedent for court X. If court Z is not on the appeals path from X, then the decisions of court Z are not binding precedent for X.<p>For copyright cases, appeals normally do NOT go to the CAFC. They go the Courts of Appeal for the circuit in which the court appealed from resides. E.g., copyright cases from district courts in the 2nd Circuit go to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.<p>In general, that is the appeals path from the Federal district court. Copyright cases aren&#x27;t specifically singled out.<p>Oracle vs. Google was tried in the 9th Circuit. If it had just been a copyright case, the appeal would have went to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. However, it was also a patent case, and patent cases are singled out. They are explicitly diverted from the normal appeals path and go to the CAFC. If the case is also some other kind of case, such as a copyright case or an antitrust case, the CAFC is allowed to hear those aspects too.<p>So does this mean that if P sues D in the 9th circuit over copyright, with no patent issues or any other issues that would bring the appeal to the CAFC, then the district court would only use the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for precedent (which I believe disagrees with CAFC), and ignore CAFC&#x27;s Google vs. Oracle copyright ruling?<p>Even more confusing, suppose P sues D over copyright and patents in the 9th Circuit. The district court figures that the case, if appealed, will go to the CAFC, and so follows CAFC precedent for the copyright aspects. Now suppose after the court rules, neither party appeals the court&#x27;s decisions on any of the patent issues. The only appeal copyright issues. Does the case still go to CAFC? Or does it go the 9th Circuit? If it goes to the 9th Circuit, do they apply their own copyright precedent or CAFC precedent?",1432721229

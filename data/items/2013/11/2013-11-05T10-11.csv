6674380,comment,6673884,6673884,7,0,nkurz,,,"Stroustrup says:<p><pre><code>  The real novelty here is the return statement: Note that
  I return a potentially huge vector by value. In C++98,
  that would typically cause the copy of all elements of
  res, potentially many thousands of elements. That would
  be a serious performance bug. In C++11, vector has a
  move constructor, so that rather than copying elements,
  the representation of res (merely three pointers) is
  stolen for use in the caller and an empty vector is left
  behind. After all, we are just about to return from 
  find_all() and wont be able to use res again. Thus,
  returning a vector by value costs at most six word
  assignments independently of the number of elements.

  Move constructors is a simple facility available to every
  programmer and used by all standard-library containers
  implemented as handles. This allows us to return large
  objects from a function without messing around with
  memory management (explicitly) using pointers and
  free store.  
</code></pre>
Are most C++ programmers excited by this?   Is the idea that people should start writing code depending on this behind the scenes behaviour, or that we now have a way to speed up poorly written code?  It feels like an awful lot of effort to avoid returning a pointer.  And if I were actually worried about the performance, I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable just hoping it happened.    Is there any confirmation by the compiler that it handled this in the way the programmer wanted?",1383648385

We take pictures all the time!! If you could provide the context to where the pictures were taken, the store it was taken in, and how there is a discount going on in that store, it would be amazing! Use the context of the photos, for instance, as &#x27;subscriptions&#x27; to these contexts.<p>To elaborate, think of this scenario. I took a photo at H&M on Regent Street in London and then at Next further along the road. Since I took at photo at H&M, you can &#x27;subscribe&#x27; me into H&M offers, etc. And same goes for Next.

Idea is decent but not amazingly novel. I feel like I&#x27;ve met both this guy and this idea 100 times before.<p>Solo founder without an amazingly impressive background. The t-shirt website is really cool - but sadly these days it&#x27;s not that novel an achievement. &quot;the t-shirt that I was selling didn&#x27;t even exist until weeks later&quot; - come on, everybody here&#x27;s read the Lean Startup/4HWW. Again for the &quot;AirBnB&#x27; feat - he wasn&#x27;t the first person to do something like this.<p>Again, this isn&#x27;t a reason to say &#x27;no&#x27; - he&#x27;s clearly smarter and more entrepreneurial than 95% of the population - but as a solo founder he needs more than that, he needs a strong reason to say &quot;yes&quot;.<p>Onto the idea itself. His early traction is pretty impressive - I wasn&#x27;t sure if writers would be interested in a tool like this. My main questions are a) how do you balance power and usability for users who might find version control hard to understand and b) is there a significant reachable market of people who would pay for this? Lots of little competitors suggests that this is an idea many people have had but not necessarily with a significant market.<p>For YC it makes sense to reject, for loren, the most interesting card in your hand right now is the feedback from publishers who face this problem and don&#x27;t have a good solution - worth focusing on them and building an MVP for their needs (if you&#x27;re not already). It might help to partner up with a biz dev guy who has experience in that industry who could help hack around the slow procurement processes that are likely common in that industry. See if you can get some smallish publishing house on board as a demo user.<p>I note that an existing YC startup &quot;Kivo&quot; is also doing &quot;Git for the masses&quot; though they&#x27;re in a more lucrative space (Powerpoint).",1383646199

5954668,comment,5951589,5952583,1,0,andrewla,,,"You&#x27;re saying that you&#x27;re not arguing about semantics, but that&#x27;s the entire content of your argument.  The talk of &quot;practitioners of civil disobedience&quot; taints any arguments that follow.  I could just as easily say &quot;other practitioners of yoga feel that actions needed to be guided by energy to be considered justified&quot;, and say that Snowden&#x27;s actions are unjusitifed for that reason (hearty apologies to any yogis out there).<p>So strip the labels entirely before applying them ruthlessly.<p>That said, let me talk to the heart of your argument, which is more about whether his actions are justified, rather than what they are called.  I would say that Snowden&#x27;s goals are twofold, in my mind.  One goal is to expose a secretive and possibly illegal operation perpetrated by a government that is supposed to represent the will of its people, that was being kept secret despite the fact that publicly acknowledging it arguably does not compromise it as a means of stopping the organizations that it is purportedly targeting, and thus the secrecy was not essential to the operation, but rather was to keep people ignorant of the violation of their privacy.<p>The second goals is to encourage other people to come forward with information that they feel satisfies these criteria.<p>The third goal, which is really, in my mind, a non-goal, is to expose the government&#x27;s harsh treatment of people who reveal government secrets.<p>Facing trial and potentially being incarcerated furthers only the third of these goals, which is not really even a goal.  It hurts the second goal significantly.  And it is largely irrelevant to the first goal, which is accomplished whether or not he is penalized.  Successfully fleeing prosecution advances the second goal significantly, and only hurts the third goal.  I don&#x27;t see how the fleeing prosecution affects the first goal in either direction, which is the most important one.<p>So are his actions justified?  I think, as do many others on this site, that the first two goals here are very important ones, and the third is not important, so in my opinion, yes, justified.  I hope his conscience is clear.  The other question, whether they are effective, is separate, and remains to be seen.  I am not optimistic; violations of privacy cause no real substantial harm until they do, and at that point it is too late to protest.  I haven&#x27;t even switched away from google, and my parents don&#x27;t even know who Edward Snowden is.",1372366764

Whether it&#x27;s an actual &quot;ID card&quot; or a passport, birth certificate, driver&#x27;s license, social security number, whatever doesn&#x27;t really matter IMO.<p>As for having to reveal/prove my identity to the police: I could do without that, but I consider it mostly a non-issue. In practice it happens rarely, and if it does the police officers tend to be pretty friendly and reasonable. Case in point, one of the two or three times this has happend to me in my life, my ID was invalid as it had expired several months before. They were basically like &quot;Well you better get a new one soon, m&#x27;kay?&quot; and then sent me on my way. YMMV of course.<p>The big difference though between the ID card thing and privacy violations by spying is that the spying happens behind people&#x27;s backs, and they may never know how broadly their rights are violated until one day the gathered information is used against them. There can be no effective oversight and that&#x27;s why it must not be allowed to happen in the first place.<p>If on the other hand the police started abusing their authority – acting like dicks, grabbing people en masse to check their IDs on every street corner, it would be immediately obvious to everyone and could presumably be corrected (by vote, protest, civil disobedience, etc).",1372365892

I started out making websites in IE3 and NS3, and you were glad just to get some sort of basic navigation going across browsers. It wasn&#x27;t really web &quot;design&quot; back in those days. Then we had the IE4 / NS4 period, where you could actually do design in the browser, provided you built it twice, once for IE and once for NS. I wrote my first web app for NS4. It was a horrible browser, but it was good for its day. Then IE 6 happened, and it was the best browser by far and set a new baseline. It&#x27;s funny to think back how at the time of its release IE 6 was an amazing browser, with fantastic standards support and stellar performance. The mozilla guys were playing catch-up churning out iterations of seamonkey, until firefox rose from seamonkey&#x27;s morass, while all that time netscape users kept suffering on with NS 4. And inexorably IE 6 got old, and people like you were writing articles about how to bend back your code to support it. IE 8 was the first MS browser where I felt they really got their standards support right, and where you could build for it without major hackery. I was of course sorely mistaken, and now IE 8 is the old stuff that doesn&#x27;t support the new hotness. It keeps shifting.<p>One good thing that happened were auto-updating browsers. You don&#x27;t see these articles anymore about supporting old versions of firefox. Microsoft has to get onto the auto-update bandwagon, and we can finally stop bending code backwards.",1372364205

Bug is a very broad term covering everything from a bona fide clear cut bug to 99.3% of some feature has been implemented but there is that missing .7%.  Also Github doesn&#x27;t support a &#x27;priority&#x27; field for issues making them useless with more than a trivial number of issues.<p>The other problem is that Github doesn&#x27;t allow multiple repositories per project (Google Code does).  That means each project has its own bug tracker and wiki (we also gave up on them) and has exactly one source repo.  If your final product experience is an aggregate of multiple different projects (eg an android client, a web server, a data backend) then bugs can easily be reported against a project when the fix is in a different one.  Having to copy/move/reference issues across projects is far too much busy work.<p>The final issue was that I talked to Zapier folk and bidirectional syncing wasn&#x27;t supported (and doesn&#x27;t appear to be today).  For example if it supported bidirectional sync between a Trello card and a Github issue then it might be manageable.

Given that the metadata (a.k.a. &quot;CDR&quot; or Call Data Record) is getting hoovered up in all this, about the only thing such a mass of data can be used for is guilt by association.  The telco&#x27;s don&#x27;t match up CDR with a captured audio stream, so that&#x27;s done by the NSA (or whoever). They&#x27;re not going to be able to do that matching, or the semantic analysis of what&#x27;s said, very often. Therefore, the ONLY thing the metadata can do is determine guilt by association.",1372363553

Proving someone wrong?<p>If the NY Times wrote an article claiming that Sergey Brin dumped raw sewage from his yacht, the responses would be based upon the <i>assumption of accuracy</i> of that story. If the story <i>isn&#x27;t</i> accurate, it will quickly be corrected (and legal avenues should be exercised, such as libel lawsuits), which has to some degree happened in this case.<p>But what are people really supposed to do? For every story everyone must stay quiet? Let claims bake for a period? Put a disclaimer &quot;If this story is accurate...&quot; before every statement? That should be presumed.<p>In the end, though, while I had no comment on the original story (it seemed like a classic &quot;they&#x27;re rich...get &#x27;em!&quot; kind of story), I certainly don&#x27;t find Parker a more reasonable chap after this 10,000 word outing. His argument is essentially-<p>a) Steelhead trout are stupid anyways. I&#x27;m humorously paraphrasing, but they <i>are</i> an endangered/threatened species, and you can&#x27;t simply lump them in with Rainbow trout and pretend it&#x27;s all good regardless.<p>b) Ignorance of the law is no defense. Saying that a group was formed before you were born makes one sound a bit like a jackass (maybe that&#x27;s what the NSA is claiming? The various rights were written before they were born, so...)<p>c) He&#x27;s good because he leveraged someone <i>else&#x27;s</i> significant mismanagement of the forest, therefore he has no culpability. This is a bit of a tragedy of the commons thing, but his argument seems to be that all of this development happened in a vacuum and he just happened to be a sad passerby who might as well make use of it.<p>I don&#x27;t think he needs to apologize to anyone, and it sounds like the land was horrendously mismanaged by the company that owns it, however this doesn&#x27;t get sympathy.",1372363431

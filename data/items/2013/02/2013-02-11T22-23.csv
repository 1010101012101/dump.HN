5203955,comment,5203036,5203756,12,0,chime,,,"I have had over a dozen positive articles about me written in newspapers, blogs, and TV segments over the years. Every single one of them misrepresented key facts, exaggerated my accomplishments, and oversimplified the invention/process. Initially I was shocked at the inaccuracies but over time I realized that despite the journalists' best intentions, they have to look at my story from different points of views and pick the angle that best fits the column's theme/focus - prodigious kid invents technology even Microsoft can't (David vs. Goliath), smart techies whip up app on weekend (HP/Apple garage-style startup), friendly-neighborhood IT guy takes a stab at unrelated field (everyone's a hidden genius).<p>One could argue that news must be devoid of any such slants, angles, or specific POVs but then we get caught in a debate about boring news that won't sell vs. sensationalized news that is meant solely to increase sales. Just like for programmers it is a constant balance between quality, deadlines, and cost, for journalists it is between truth, importance, and sales. '12 more people dead in blast in Tel Aviv' is truth and important but not sensational enough to sell. 'No-name D-list celeb gets caught speeding' is truth and sensational but not important.<p>In articles like this, they're trying to make it sound important and sensational while skirting around the limits of truth. In personal articles we've been involved in, they play the angles to show importance and make it sensational while not caring much about the factual accuracies.",1360623486

5203936,comment,5198425,5201731,1,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> Sometimes you have to cut your losses ;-) Another reason why I dislike the term ""live programming"" is because it confuses two separate concepts: continuous feedback and rich feedback.<p>Again if we go back to Hancock's thesis, it's all there! It's not just about continuous feedback, it's about feedback with respect to a steady frame, it's about feedback that is relevant to your programming taks, it's about feedback that is comprehensible. Hancock got it right the first time, there is no classical live programming (though there were other forms of liveness before). Actually, this is something I didn't get myself in my 2007 paper.<p>I don't think I need to abondon my word, especially since the standard bearer are Bret's demos; people want ""that"", not some sort of vaguely defined Smalltalk hot swapping experience. The community I'm fighting for the word is small and insignificant vs. the Bret fans :).<p>As for the rest of your post, explicit state migration is a big deal for deployment hot swapping (Erlang?) but ultimately a nuance during a debugging session. A ""best"" effort with reset as a back up is more usable.<p>But maybe take a look at our UIST dj Vu paper [1]: here the input is defined as a recorded video that undergoes Kinect processing, and we are primarily interested in the intermediate output frames, not just the last one. So the primary problems are one of visualization, while we ignore the hard problem of memoization and just replay the whole program. We even have the possibility to manage multiple input streams and switch between them.<p>Kinect programs are good examples of extremely stateful programs with well defined inputs. One of the next problems I'm trying to solve is how to memoize between the frames of such programs to make the feedback more lively.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=179367"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=1793...</a>",1360623237

Having said that I think this is an interesting tack to take. Firstly, this is the New York Times. I'm sure they take their integrity pretty seriously. Secondly, Musk has sued before so that would make them <i>particularly sensitive</i> to ensuring that they got their facts and figures correct if they're going to post a negative article. Thirdly, I'm not sure how much of an argument Musk is really mounting here. There are still a bunch of charges left unaddressed. That the charge dissipated much faster than it was telling the driver. That cutting things like heating and speed were solutions? That it didn't have a sufficient charge to unlock a handbrake etc.<p>Why does this matter? Well, we all know Tesla is a cutting edge technology. Those who buy that car understand that they're going to take on additional hardships and risks vs a gasoline vehicle. Culturally, what message is Musk sending by attacking the author and avoiding many of the issues raised?

5203910,comment,5203510,5203510,19,0,grellas,,,"<i>The best entrepreneurs are ones who work in their field first, gaining valuable real-world knowledge and experience for a decade or more.</i><p>I don't think one can meaningfully say that the ""best"" entrepreneurs come in one type or another. Certainly the YC juggernaut tends to confirm that young entrepreneurs can be extremely able and can lead ventures to spectacular forms of success.<p>But the statement above emphasizes for me what has always seemed obvious and yet has often been brushed aside in, let us say, the impetuousness of youth: that is, that experience can and often does make a huge difference for entrepreneurs and it is a mistake to ignore its value in assessing startup prospects.<p><i>Someone, somewhere, somehow</i> needs to have ""been there before"" for a startup to work in a big, complex, and disruptive field such as those targeted by the most promising startups. If it is not the founders themselves, it is those with whom the founders surround themselves. If those persons are not there, it has been my experience (having represented countless founders) that the founders will tend to stumble around to their detriment. I believe the main value of the YC network, for example, is that it gives young entrepreneurs precisely the sort of connections and guidance by which they can connect up with and be guided or even mentored by those with solid experience in their respective domains. Without that, their chances of flubbing it are magnified  by a lot. A VC with deep domain experience can add similar value, with or without YC, but of course its connections with key VCs is one of the ways that YC links its entrepreneurs with seasoned hands in a given field.<p>It follows <i>ipso facto</i> that entrepreneurs who are older and can bring direct experience to a venture will also often have it over younger, inexperienced ones. The opposite may be true as well and that the value of such experience in any given case may be limited or worthless. My point is that having key experience, when it is authentic and coupled with the right level of talent, is extremely valuable and should be eagerly welcomed when brought to the venture by older entrepreneurs.<p>We learn from our mistakes. That is a recurring theme on this forum. Those lessons don't simply take the form of ""fail fast, fail often"" because the virtue is not in the failing as such but in the lessons learned from the process - and that same virtue attaches to any quality experience by talented people who have tilled the soil in their areas of expertise for lengthy periods. That group may or may not be the ""best"" entrepreneurs but there will certainly be large numbers of them who will wind up being among the best by virtue of the depth and expertise that only quality experience can bring.",1360623018

SEO is a niche side of web programming that fixes that specific problem. The skills of an SEO sometimes don't even cross the mind of a ""good"" web programmer because of the unknown unknowns factor.

GUIs are after all containers and components which map nicely to nodes in a tree.<p>CSS is great for presentation (colors, font styles etc). One of its strengths is its simplicity and its cascading nature.<p>What we need is a sane constraints-based layout model. This is standard fare for native apps (eg: iOS autolayout).<p>Imagine being able to specify:<p><pre><code>  Block_A sits at the top of the window.
  Block_B is anchored to the bottom edge of Block_A.
  Block_C is inside of Block_B and is anchored to the left edge.

In duck typing, if all you're interested in is walk_like_a_duck, anything with walk_like_a_duck is acceptable, even something that doesn't talk_like_a_duck, because in reality,  you never defined the ""duck"" type to begin with; the actual ""duck"" type doesn't even exist.  In structural typing, ""duck"" would be a concrete type.  ""duck typing"" is a pretty shitty name for it, to be honest, because of that saying ""if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's a duck"", but the reality is it's more like ""if I need something that walks_like_a_duck and this walks_like_a_duck then it's good enough for me"".<p>let's put it in another perspective:  if you have a function that takes disparate types, then the thing that's passed in that function may be of arbitrary type.  It's unknown at compile time how much memory will be allocated for the instantiation of that function in order to accept the parameter, because the type that's being passed it is unknown.  In structural typing, like in Go, you know at compile time the type of the thing being passed in, and therefore, the amount of resources that will be required upon calling.<p>Or in another sense, an array of an interface value in Go has a well-defined memory layout, whereas an array of disparate types in a dynamic language does not have a well-defined memory layout at compile time.<p>internally, an interface value in Go is a two-tuple; it's an actual <i>additional</i> structure; it <i>boxes</i> the structure we're interested in.

Him: I think some real world uses of python are 90% C libraries and 10% python Me: I feel the cases you are referring to are the unusual ones I spoke of.<p>Except dnu never said that ""some"" real world uses of Python are ""90%"" C libraries. He said, and I quote:<p>> for real projects, a Python programmer might use several libraries which are written in C.<p>That is, <i>most</i> real world uses of Python use <i>some</i> C libraries. He never suggested a ridiculous number like 90%. Your comment came across as a mockery of his argument, saying that Python could never achieve reasonable speed unless it was 90% C anyway. If this isn't what you intended, I apologize for insinuating that it was.<p>It came across that way because almost no real-world Python application uses 90% C, unless you want to count the entire kernel and OS it runs on.<p>---<p>>> Your Django argument falls flat if you look at it more closely. Sure, Django might introduce some slowness, but the vast majority of web performance is in the networking and database layers, not the application layer<p>> That is completely, and entirely false. Scripting language web frameworks like django, rails, zend, etc are dozens to hundreds of times slower than similar frameworks in compiled languages.<p>I think you misunderstand me. My point was that the parts of a web application that have the biggest impact on performance are the networking and database layers, not the application layer, and that language choice only affects the database and application layers. I was not arguing that Django, Rails, Zend, or other dynamic language based frameworks are as fast as compiled language based frameworks.<p>It may not seem like the database is that influential to performance at first - but imagine a database driver written in Python. It would be by far the slowest performing part of the application, because the database requires such enormous amounts of computation and is used so much. Thus, database drivers are written in C, so they perform quickly. But that 20% or less of the code, written in C for performance reasons, cuts down an 80% or greater slowdown which would occur if the database drivers were written in Python.<p>Also, as an aside, Django is hardly representative of Python as a whole. I haven't used it - I've done all my Python web development in Flask, so far, so my opinions on it aren't authoritative, and aren't intended to be so, but it seems to be an overly bloated framework whose performance is much slower than Python in general.<p>---<p>Again, I don't intend to be insulting and demeaning, and it is clear that the disagreement is due at least in part to some misunderstandings earlier in the conversation. I am happy to engage in technical discussion, even if it becomes somewhat heated, but I don't want to degrade the forum or make enemies by engaging in personal diatribe.

Basically back in the mid 2000's there were 2 things that spurred the all-js apps: Google docs and the mobile phone biz. Google showed everyone what a full-on js framework could do in a browser, but there was no available API for people use to build their own tools. Then when phone apps became all the rage, people started developing js/app APIs starting with sproutcore way back when (now called ember.js). Then there's sencha touch, etc.  Backbone, etc is sort of an evolution on these themes of having a front end API but for the web.<p>In terms of going backward, I think that there are some advantages and drawbacks. There clearly a polling/ajax problem when alot of people need to be pinging the server for tiny updates. If all of this can be pushed onto the client (especially requests for html blobs) you reduce server traffic and make things more snappy (no more preloaders). The downside is having all your code on the client. I wonder if there are unsolved security implications to having so much logic on the client. All-in-all for a standard web app, theres nothing wrong with the old school 'keep it on the server' approach. But if you need alot of dynamic ""app""-like behavior, then having a front end API will benefit you more in the end.",1360621648

It would allow a person to develop a deep understanding of core concepts such as different data structures and algorithms without being bogged down in the minutiae. Once I think there is a solid foundation in the general concepts I think it would be much easier to transition from language to language since they already understand the semantics of what they are trying to do and simply have to focus on the sytax to accomplish it.<p>Now this has the potential to lead to disintrest since they wouldn't have the ability to create something and receive the instant feedback of their hard work.

Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max & took a long detour""<p>If you read the NYT, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/automobiles/stalled-on-the-ev-highway.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/automobiles/stalled-on-the...</a><p>The reporter doesn't claim he had charged the battery fully in all occasions. He states how long he charged the car for and what the milage indicator provided.<p>I can argue Musk is trying to get ahead of the story and create doubt among potential buyers about the veracity of the story. That's all he needs to do.<p>Basically, Tesla will probably come out with data that shows the battery was not fully charged and hence why lower milage. However, the reporter says he only charged the car for the distance he thought he needed. Therefore, Tesla will be a head of the story and the headlines his PR will create is that the car was not fully charged. And most people, including readers of this site, will not do further investigation. Rest assure those who are still considering buying a Tesla will buy it not knowing if the battery might have a temperature range issue.",1360620542

Moving the wire thru the field generates electricity, the faster the wire moves the higher the voltage is. But the more current is moving thru the wire (more load, more things using the electricity), the more it pushes back against the magnetic field (because that current in the wire generates its own field) and so the harder it is to make it move.",1360620539

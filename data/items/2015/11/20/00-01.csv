The model of a doctor as a paternal guardian who knows better than you so you should just do as he says is a very bad model. They&#x27;re as flawed human beings as anyone else and the only person qualified to fight for your best interests is you. Doctors get complacent, lazy and fail to keep up with the latest information unless you press them to do so. You HAVE to stay informed and aware to get the best treatment. Ads can serve an important function of informing patients of new treatment options and if doctors could truely be entrusted with your health without question then there wouldn&#x27;t be a need to regulate these ads at all since doctors would only be perscribing the best treatments anyway.

It&#x27;s actually very nicely done.<p>When the modem can&#x27;t access the cable infrastructure, it turns itself into a DHCP server and hands out IP addresses in the range 192.168.100.xx. This is useful for people at home whose configurations are such that their home networks won&#x27;t work properly without some sort of DHCP server provided by the ISP.<p>Once the modem can talk to the ISP, it turns itself into a bridge. The IP addresses the modem previously issued were valid for 30 seconds, so there will shortly be a new DHCPREQUEST which the modem bridges out to the ISP. From then on, the modem is transparent to IP traffic (but see below).<p><i>My definition of cable modem doesn&#x27;t include an IP address.</i><p>This is highly useful. Once the modem has switched to being a bridge, it still responds to 192.168.100.1. There&#x27;s all sorts of useful information there. E.g. DOCSIS status, Channel IDs, received Signal to Noise ratio, transmit Power Level, etc. There&#x27;s even a nice (but short) log of the modem&#x27;s interaction with the cable infrastructure.<p>The modem is outside my firewall, so I don&#x27;t really worry about it much.

It&#x27;s been a serious problem there (probably since the GV dictatorship) and has been a growing problem in the US as service men return from war zones and police the same way at home that they did when at war.<p>I don&#x27;t have statistics here, but my impression from the news is that cops excessively single out POC in routine police work (traffic stops, stopping pedestrians, etc.) and that the excessive militarization of police actions affects everyone, not just POC. This story seems to be more an issue of the problem with militarization of police action more than a POC issue up until the misunderstanding was cleared up. Once the misunderstanding was identified it seems like a story that is about both how POC are treated unfairly and how cops always protect their own even when they are wrong.<p>What&#x27;s very frustrating is how everyone (cops and neighbor) acted after it was clear that there was misunderstanding, that degree of force was unnecessary and that the cops failed to take corrective action and protected themselves and were generally uncooperative.<p>+1 for the comment about how body cameras are needed.",1447978009

The OEM SNES D-pad and Playstation Dual Shock D-pads get this right; the standard XBox/360 gamepad completely miffed this, making playing throwback/retro 2D games that used the D-pad for control a total drag.",1447977649

The fact I can pick up any Dual Shock or Xbox 360 controller and it feel just like every other one is pretty mind blowing. Sure over time they develop their own little habits but out of the box they are almost clones (with the exception of ones that should have failed QA but somehow shipped).",1447977643

This dragged urban health and life expectancy to a nadir around 1900 — a date that consequently provides a highly misleading baseline. (The trend was even reflected in people’s height. The minimum height for infantry was lowered from 5ft 6in to 5ft 3in, then later to 5ft, in just two decades.)&quot;<p>High salt and high sugar led to a shrinking height. Could this be applied to how the average height is rising in the US?",1447977626

(OK, except that built in function names have no pattern to the naming.)<p>I think people hate it precisely because it's so easy to get started with. Have you ever met people who, the more obscure something is, the more they like it?<p>Linux is now too mainstream for them, so they use hurd. You see it with health food too - regular health food is too mainstream, so now you must eat local. Soy used to be eaten only by health nuts, now that it's mainstream, they say not to eat it.<p>These are people who hate all the regular languages and love the obscure ones (I won't name them for fear of flame wars). You can like an obscure language, but if you also hate the regular ones, you just want to be different and that's all.",1223301091

The index and middle fingers are strongest, so the keys under them are the most valuable.  I'm typically chording on the modifier keys and spacebar, so ""v"" and neighboring keys are quite valuable to me.<p>I agree that the default tool shortcuts in that area are somewhat wasted; Photoshop seems to have chosen shortcuts more for mnemonic value and got lucky with the Marquee tool forcing Move to the ""v"" key.  Crop (""c"") isn't needed with the same frequency as the drawing tools, and Zoom (""z"") -- while useful for beginners -- is effectively unnecessary with the ctrl-space and ctrl-alt-space key chords.  ""x"" (exchange foreground and background), however, is extremely useful e.g. for quickly switching between drawing and erasing on black-and-white drawings.",1223300061

PHP is a DSL for web programming and Perl is (arguably) a DSL for Unix system administration, so it is probably worth including those in the core language.

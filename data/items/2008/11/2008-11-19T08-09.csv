It helps immensely with all aspects of my life - not just code. I can put ideas to paper (or screen, as it were) very, very quickly. This drives a lot of iterations and allows me to hone and fine-tune my work even further.<p>I'm also able to write up large amounts of text - blog posts, forum posts, etc etc, and all have over the years helped me become a better communicator. I <i>enjoy</i> discussing things with people and writing about my work, and I can't imagine doing the volume that I do as a slower typist at, say, 30wpm.<p>Like others here have mentioned, being a fast and accurate typist is like having a direct mind connection to the computer - your words come out almost as quickly as you can think of them.",1227084852

If you know what you are doing (which would be a must, anyway).<p>ps: Steven's book is full of spin, so I guess some of them would also make it to his website and vice-versa: this is called marketing and propaganda...",1227083947

I am trying in my own blog to present my work in both a form accessible to the literate public and helpful for researchers (though I have neither published most of my work yet, nor attracted an audience the size of the New Yorker so you will just have to be patient!)<p>Arguably, Flynn did his best with ""What is intelligence?"" but people probably ran for the hills at the first formula. Such is life. But there are at least a few scientists who write for the public audience, Dawkins, Dyson, Hawking and Pinker perhaps most relevantly today, that do attract a wide readership. I honestly think Gladwell does a better job presenting things straight than Hawking.<p>The rice field argument, while apparently silly, doesn't strike me as particularly wrong. I'm merely unconvinced.<p>Does Gladwell in this book, more than his others, draw theories from <i>selected</i> scattered 'outliers,' more often than reasonable? I do not know how far he goes.",1227083037

369313,comment,368985,368987,0,0,aristus,,,"Children don't lose net weight unless they are severely undernourished. Kids are essentially weight gaining machines except for plateaus at 5, 12 and 18. They may, however, stop growing as fast as other kids.<p>The problem is it's fairly easy to not notice or to ignore mild malnutrition. There is a huge dropoff in health and mental development if your kids don't eat right or eat enough, even if they are not obviously starving.",1227082612

It has no influence in the real world.  I think most people, regardless of their political orientation, would rather have some control over an imperfect process than none at all.<p>By asking to talk to members of the Libertarian Party, you're refusing to talk to the subset of libertarians who can make compromises, and deal with the moral ambiguities that exist in the real world.  There are some well-meaning people in the Libertarian Party, but mostly you're asking for compound-dwelling wackos.",1227082567

All they're doing is creating a way to track illegal activity.<p>I wonder what the laws are on selling the track and then deleting it though. Is that as legal as selling a cd, or do you get sign some sort of legal agreement when you purchase the track? I've never purchased a single track online so I don't know much about that.",1227082512

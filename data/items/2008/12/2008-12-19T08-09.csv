unequivocal ""yes"".<p>Yes, the act of programming itself makes me happy.
I've always loved building things, and programming is yet another outlet
for that energy.  Additionally, I love the thrill of bending a computer
to my will, teaching it to do what I want to produce the output I need.
Shortly after finishing an extended programming project, often times I
feel a sense of loss, and a drive to seek out the next interesting thing
I'll get to tackle.<p>Are you asking because you feel like you should be enjoying it more than
you do?  Did you used to get more enjoyment from it than you currently
do, or have you always felt this way?  If you're second guessing yourself, I think mechanical_fish's suggestion
of giving it a break for a while is a great one.",1229677084

403172,comment,403147,403147,0,0,skynomad,,,"I think this might be the wrong place to be looking for such answers. Anyway, you might like to do some research on Emergence and Chaos theory. The fundamental aspect of emergence is that individual agents (ie neurons) follow simple rules, and through interaction with other agents also following these simple rules, a system emerges which is greater than the sum of its parts, with its own goals and intelligence which is not known to any of its individual agents. There is a brilliant book on this entitled ""Emergence: The connected lives of ants, brains, cities and software"" by Steven Johnson.<p>Another interesting author to read is Brian Fay. He argues that the conscious 'self' does not exist as a concrete thing, but rather, it is dynamically created through interaction. He gives a very interesting analogy of an eye traveling through space, and can only become aware of itself by seeing its reflection. He then explains that we see our reflection in others, and eventually that becomes internalised.<p>The reality is that the brain is the most complex structure we have yet encountered, and it will be a very long time before we fully understand how it works and how the mind is thus constructed within it.",1229676708

403154,comment,402908,403090,0,0,iigs,,,"It sounds like you and netcan are both going the same direction, so I'll address both at the same time.<p>Personally I'm pretty libertarian. I know this is a volatile viewpoint to hold on reddit (less so but still somewhat here). I try to be pragmatic about it, so my viewpoint isn't 100% soundbite-consistent; things need to be evaluated on a case by case basis.<p>Welfare: probably not. I think welfare is probably best executed at the state level, much as it is in the US now. The subsidization of some states via others is not addressed by this, and I suspect is largely your point. Certainly within the first world even the meager income of the poor states would be enough to care for their own, perhaps at considerable expense in other aspects. If the issue is ""trade embargos or extreme poverty"" I'd definitely flex to the (extreme) point that Cuba has, in that they've basically rebuilt their agricultural system from first principles -- it doesn't sound like a walk in the park, but it sounds like they've done well for themselves given their situation.<p>Unions: abstain. My life experiences are not sufficient to force my opinions about unions on others. My grandfather fed my father from their farmstead in Iowa. As a child food was put on my plate by my father who was either self employed or worked at companies where he could name every employee. I've only ever worked at companies that have healthy meritocracy ecosystems, including my current one where I'm a shareholder. I've never been a shareholder at a unionized company, nor have I ever felt like I've been had by the balls, so to speak, so I can't say how I'd want to be treated in that case.<p>Ecology/environment: nation trading associations may be useful. Whether the issue at hand is Mediterranean bluefin tuna or hydrocarbon emissions, states/countries financial motivation often collide with worldwide ecological impact. In these cases applying financial pressure looks like the simplest and most direct way to rebalance things. I'm not up on MTBE, but it sounds like a non-financial issue: CA wanted a waiver to go non-oxygenated when ethanol supplies were disrupted. I haven't seen the numbers, but in the absence of numbers I side with California on it: use of non-oxygenated fuel would be seemingly uncommon with the benefit constant and permanent (no MTBE tanks leaking). ""Disruption of ethanol supplies"" could be considered a financial issue in that they might be under-engineered. Perhaps an association of nations could put financial pressure on a nation that was under-engineering their supplies to ensure that their use of non-oxygenated fuels was minimized.<p>In summary: I think I may have overstepped the line when I used the word ""any"" (as is usually the case with that damn word) -- there are certainly valid cases for tempering financial interaction with other entities, particularly when their actions harm you (world eco/enviro being an example). That said, it's important for the health of a capitalist entity that people be able to take the action that best serves them (in the absence of undue harm to others). Furthermore, it's a two-way street, or, a rising tide floats all boats -- China can buy Buicks because Americans can buy T-shirts. To the point of the article, my life is better because of the products I've been able to buy from wherever I choose to, and this holds true regardless of the current state of the economy.",1229675400

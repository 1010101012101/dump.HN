Throughout history, when the free peasants (small farmers who could actually fend for themselves on land they lived on) became actual serfs (more or less slaves to the lords), their empires crumbled.<p>Until England worked this all out by creating the age of imperial commerce where the peasants became wage laborers who got paid <i>before</i> the harvest was taken. This is the creation story of the British Empire. The U.S. adopted it after Shays Rebellion.<p>The last unanswered question here: if all you have to participate in a market is to sell your body (brains and all), are you really free?",1441940375

10201771,comment,10201724,10201724,0,0,nadams,,,"I wrote this in about a day and for a couple of reasons.<p>Google Code is shutting down - going into an archive only mode. But I feel like it&#x27;s still useful to have your own offline copy for research and/or offline archival purposes (or archive to another service).<p>FlossMole [1] did write some tools to scrape Google Code and other services - but the instructions were lacking on exactly what you needed to do to run it. I wanted a no-non sense tool that pretty much anyone could use.<p>One important point about this library is that it does scrape wiki and issues - but for downloads and repo locations it merely presents the URLs to you and you need to decide what you want to do wit that (not really hard - either curl the releases or svn co/hg clone/git clone the repo). I did this to minimize the crawling load.<p>Yes there is also an export to github - but again I am off the mindset that it is important to archive data rather than just copy it to another service (I think the archive team agrees with that as well [2]).<p>If you still aren&#x27;t convinced this could be useful - I think it would be pretty awesome if someone grabbed all the code repos and created a public OpenGork [3] instance to be able to do an advanced search through all the code (it even support regex searching). I think that would be pretty amazing to offer as an online and offline tool.<p>I expanded it to support srchub - which I run. Feel free to use it against it (all you have to do is replace the URL to the production instance). If there is interest I would be open to expanding it to support gitlab, github, and bitbucket.<p>This tool isn&#x27;t perfect as I made it quickly but I think it does the job. I am open to issues or problems with it. And if you think it sucks - as the subversion authors once said &quot;patches welcome&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/flossmole/source/browse/#svn%2FFLOSSmoleGoogleCode%2Fsrc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/flossmole/source/browse/#svn%2FFLO...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Google_Code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Google_Code</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://opengrok.github.io/OpenGrok/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opengrok.github.io/OpenGrok/</a>",1441940249

10201741,comment,10201611,10201706,0,0,mikerichards,,,"I think one of Rich Hickey&#x27;s quotes expands on your point:<p><i>It has always been an unfortunate characteristic of using classes for application domain information that it resulted in information being hidden behind class-specific micro-languages, e.g. even the seemingly harmless employee.getName() is a custom interface to data. Putting information in such classes is a problem, much like having every book being written in a different language would be a problem. You can no longer take a generic approach to information processing. This results in an explosion of needless specificity, and a dearth of reuse.<p>This is why Clojure has always encouraged putting such information in maps, and that advice doesn&#x27;t change with datatypes. By using defrecord you get generically manipulable information, plus the added benefits of type-driven polymorphism, and the structural efficiencies of fields. OTOH, it makes no sense for a datatype that defines a collection like vector to have a default implementation of map, thus deftype is suitable for defining such programming constructs.</i>",1441939734

In my city every lane of every intersection has a separate inductive loop to measure traffic congestion, speed and amount. Also every few hundred meters between intersections. Perfect data, and you only collect as much as necessary.<p>In comparison, Google&#x27;s system: Track the location of everyone, and then check if people are moving slowly on a road in a car.<p>One of these stores an Orwellian amount of information, the other stores just as much as necessary.<p>Anyway, as a German, I hate this type of data collection.

We worked on the road travelling to different job sites. Our employer would put us up in a hotel and we would drive to the job site. Some big jobs had &#x27;man camps&#x27; on site so you didn&#x27;t have to worry about this, but often we would be an hour or more from the job site and commute everyday. We didn&#x27;t get to decide where we lived. 
In one instance my hotel was in one country and my work site in another. We spent an hour just dealing with border control each way, every day.<p>Now I am US citizen so this doesn&#x27;t help me any but this is a global job and the same circumstances exist in Europe as they do here for working field service jobs. 
I gave just one small example, but think about all the plumbers, HVAC, electricians, construction workers, highway crews, that all have to travel to the job site. Their employer bids on jobs that are often very far from their homes and the shop.<p>It really sucks having to bust ass for 12 hours a day and have an hour or more commute back home, or back to the shop everyday after work. It sucks even more that it&#x27;s unpaid, but until now people just had to accept as being a norm.<p>I&#x27;m certain there will need to be adjustments in labor rate/job bids to accommodate this, but the hopeful in me is that it&#x27;s worth it.<p>edit: sorry I saw your edit after I posted.",1441937472

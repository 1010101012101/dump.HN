None. Because (I submit) what it means for something to exist is completely different for each thing.<p>Discussions about God constantly founder on this point - at the outset, when discussing the mere existence of God, it seems almost inevitable that every single characteristic is removed from the table until there is nothing to say about him.<p>But if his existence seems to be proven, then a massive conjunction of claims about him (indeed, a great number of claims specific to a religion) tends to spring up out of nowhere, as if these did not need to be specifically shown.<p>This shouldn't be surprising, since many specialists in apologetics have admitted openly that their purpose is not to zero in on the truth through reasoning and discussion but to try to use reason as a weapon against itself to clear the way for adherence to some specific religion.<p>""I'm trying to figure it out"" isn't a religion, unfortunately.",1335934768

3917695,comment,3917104,3917566,25,0,snprbob86,,,"> I'm not so sure I agree that simple hashes are the best choice for internal data representations<p>I've been contributing to the Clojure community lately. My experience working with hash-maps as the primary data structure has been entirely liberating.<p>At my startup, we've got an app with Sinatra services, a Rails API, a Node.js web frontend, and Backbone client code. JSON gets passed between them. Being forced to encode keys as strings is a mild annoyance that Clojure's reader syntax avoids, but the real issue is that I've got raw JSON, Javascript domain objects (Backbone.Model), Ruby models (ActiveRecord), and Ruby hashes (hashie/mash/similar). Each has their own idiosyncrasies and interfaces. Of all of them, the raw JSON is most pleasurable to work with. CoffeeScript & Underscore.js roughly approximate 10% of the awesomeness that is Clojure's core data structures, including maps, sets, vectors, and lazy-seqs.<p>ActiveRecord, for example, makes it super easy to tangle a bunch of objects up. If we had a big bag of functions, they could operate on in-memory hashes, or they could operate on database rows, or they could operate on the result of an API call. It would be so much simpler to reuse code between our main Rails API and our Sinatra service. And we could one-for-one translate functions for non-Ruby services. Instead of requiring a crazy tangled ness of polymorphism and mutable state.<p>> Every non-trivial program is going to have to define abstract datatypes<p>Absolutely true. However, Clojure has taught me that you really aught to only define a very small number of those. It's been said that it's much better to have 100 functions which operate on 1 data structures, than to have 10 functions that operate on 10. Clojure's get-in function for example: (get-in some-hash [:some :key :path]) is glorious compared to Ruby's some_hash[:some][:key][:path] because you don't need to go monkey patch in a get_path method. And even if you did monkey patch that in, it won't work for the some_object.some.key.path case, unless you got fancy with object.send and yet another monkey patch.<p>Look at some of the substantial pieces of Clojure code out there. They may only define a small handful of data structures, but most of those are even defined with defrecord, which produces a hash-like object, which all those 100s of functions work on. The rest are tiny primitives that compose in powerful an interesting ways.<p>> I'm not sure how embedding and dispatching on a type tag in a hash is any better than using the more explicit support for dynamic dispatch you find in typical OO languages<p>Because you may want differing dispatch & single-dispatch inheritance doesn't let you change your mind as easily. Those dynamic dispatches in Ruby/Python whatever are simply hash lookups anyway. You'll get the same performance either way. Look at the output of the ClojureScript compiler for example. Most code paths dispatch on :op, but you could just as easily dispatch on some bit of metadata, maybe the [:meta :dynamic] key path to have a function that runs differently on static vars than dynamic ones. People are also working on advanced predicate dispatch systems.<p>> The real problem with most OO is that it mashes a lot of interdependent, mutable state together.<p>That's <i>a</i> real problem. But it's not <i>the</i> real one :-)",1335934545

And in that case the supernatural existence of God is totally pointless if it is even an issue. And it wouldn't work to disjunctively define 'caused by God' as meaning 'no natural cause' because some or all natural causes would be from God.<p>I suspect that the insistence on words like 'supernatural' is an insistence on an honorific, and on a social attempt to suspend the use of reason and evidence as they pertain to specific topics. Theists who don't insist on this kind of artificial isolation between talk about God and (say) talk about numbers or ethics or physics necessarily become more heavily engaged in the messy details. For similar reasons, dismissing the supernatural is quick and satisfying for skeptics in a way which extended theological arguments are not",1335934116

It is the exact same thing people would do with cassette taps 2 decades ago, when the RIAA decried mix tapes would kill music.  2 decades later, that industry is bigger than ever.<p>The difference is that one cassette is much more expensive than 15 megabytes of magnetic storage, and the gas to go from a friends house to let you copy their tape is much more expensive than the electricity and internet bills to transfer the data.<p>But it is such a common misconception that it is stealing - it is duplicating bits of data on magnetic storage that, by nature of the physical properties of the device, are extremely easy to replicate.<p>Yes, it is ""hard"" to understand the concept that once released, the content is no longer under the control of the creator.  But defying the physics of physical storage only causes what we have now - big corporate lobbies are pushing to destroy all personal privacy to make sure no one uses the inherent properties of the technology developed in ways they don't desire.<p>And that will destroy the internet and society at large if left unchecked.

Big, lumbering, dead-trees news org, right?  Check out WaPo Labs sometime - they play around with projects that you might not expect from BigCo.  I worked in a division of a big online company for a time, and we had a great culture as a division, and also within the smaller team I was on, a real drive to move the needle in new ways for the business.  I've also worked in a 4-person company that couldn't get itself organized enough to get meaningful work done.  Long story short, culture of the team and company are probably going to be more important than size at the end of the day.  Oh, and industry will probably make a difference as well.

If I wasn't working in 3D I would have went with (or switched to) Moai. It looks like a great mix of productivity boosting features and a no-BS, close to the metal way to create cross platform code. I also like their focus on the networking, advertising, analytics, etc features in their SDK.<p>I'm currently using Unity. Their core product is decent but their team (at least the CEO and the sales guys, I haven't interacted with any tech guys) are obnoxious. I met with their sales rep in Asia (where I'm based) and he told me in no uncertain terms that they don't care about small teams. And that they were horrible at communicating because they don't see themselves as having any real competition. I think it's the fist time I've been heavily invested in a technology and at the same time wanted to see it become obsolete.<p>One of the best parts of Moai is Lua. I had started with Unity working in C# (seemed like it would be less performance bound) but didn't really like the toolkit until I switched over to the relatively obscure Boo (it has a Python-like syntax). Even with the almost total lack of documentation it's just way more productive than the other language choices. Switching to really terse scripting language has had a big impact on productivity for me.",1335933005

3917610,comment,3916367,3917571,7,0,malkia,,,"Firefox was written in C++, and WebKit too (coming from KDE). It could be that C++ is better fit for frameworks, while C for libraries.<p>V8 is also C++, but lots of other successfull VM's are written in ""C""<p>I like ""C"" because it's more limiting, hence I won't see templates overused, or latest trick used (SFINAE). It's also easier for me to read.<p>Also at binary level things are simpler - here is your function, and it's name, it takes this and this as parameter, and returns this and that, also follows this convetion (stdcall, pascal, fortran, etc.)<p>With C++ my biggest pain has been name mangling. I'm not sure why this was not standartized. It's actually much better that the name of the function automatically contains what types it can take, which would've been much easier for dynamic binding, but then you have GNU, MSVC and others totally differs on how they mangle the name (and from version to version it changes a lot). Also exception handling (mingw/cygwin/msvc - there is big confusion there, and on binary compability level it's hard to combine one with another).<p>My last show-stopper for C++ was - on this platform you can' t use this feature. For example on certain game consoles exceptions are not allowed. So you go with longjmp/setjmp, but then this would not unwind the stack and call destructors.<p>Most of all, I got bitten by a heavily templated math library - it was much faster with optimizations than the one before, but without (debug) it was several times slower than same one before it. Why? Because it was relying on inlining everything, and back then gcc for playstation2 was not really inlining everything, even if it was forced.<p>So every overloaded operation (matrix by matrix, or matrix by vector) was actually function call.<p>There is another gotcha - sometimes overloaded C++ operators lose their ability to short-cut. For example overloading && and || would not longer short-cut, and many other gotchas.<p>Most of all, I can't stand boost - it's just too huge.<p>But I'm totally fine with C++ the simple way (whatever this is) - best example for me is ZeroMQ lib - it's C++ internally, they limit themselves to not use exceptions, and provide ""C"" interface by default.

(A) insist on generating their own packages for modules (and typically, taking forever to update them). (B) not providing any kind of isolation. (C) building on top of these non-isolated modules.<p>What I do these days is leave the system Python 100% for the use of the distro (at most, dependencies for minor command line scripts which don't have import relationships with code I'm working on). Development occurs inside virtualenvs, production apps run inside virtualenvs. I use pip to install, remove, pin versions.<p>Dependency versions are really part of the app; the right versions should be pip installable inside a virtualenv, and this is just something which should be done automatically on a deploy. I don't mean you need to include the whole code for your dependencies in your project, but pinning versions is important to not having to put out fires.<p>You really don't want any versions to advance automatically until you have had a chance at least to run unit tests - if things are working then pin the new version. Of course, if you are using a library which never suffers regressions or API changes then you don't need to do this.<p>In short, the dependency list and versions should be included with the project and managed by the developers so that deploys are really a matter of creating a virtualenv (with --no-site-packages) and running pip -r requirements.txt to install the right stuff.",1335932386

I am away from my girlfriend for the next five months or so and up to now we are only using Facebook messages, and I have growing concerns over privacy (Not that a move to Pair will solve them).

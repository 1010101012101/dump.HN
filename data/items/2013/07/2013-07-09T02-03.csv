There&#x27;s zero performance cost for many strings because the rune count is known at compile time. For the rest, most strings are too short for Big-O analysis to be relevant and I would guess (enlighten me if I&#x27;m wrong) that the cost of computing the bounds of each character is negligible on a modern processor. Multi-byte chars in a string are going to be adjacent in memory, adjacent in cache, and therefore trivial for today&#x27;s not-at-all-instruction-bound CPUs.

6010831,comment,6010789,6010789,1,0,rtpg,,,"In a previous news post about Afghanistan in the 60s, I mentioned British colonial rule as a major player in the deindustrialization of India. This was something I heard in my economics class a while ago, so I looked more into it and found this paper.<p>Section 2 of the paper gives a nice narrative of the events. In summary the paper proposes two events played a role in destroying the textile industry of India in the 18th century. Firstly, the political turmoil at the time of the dissolution of the Mughal empire, which reduced agricultural productivity, among other things. This raised prices of food, thus of manufactured goods such as textiles.Secondly, East India Company rule led to pro-British policies, namely reducing import tariffs and destroying the industry because it couldn&#x27;t compete to the more advanced productivity of the British goods.<p>This second point is something we see often now through the mess of the Washington consensus: We get rid of trade barriers in countries whose industries couldn&#x27;t possibly compete because they&#x27;ve not yet developed properly. This destroys any possibility of a local market being created properly. Infant industry protection is necessary to allow growth in beginning stages of developement, and destroying trade barriers is the worst thing we can do on that front.",1373338568

Uniformity is one of the consequences rather than the requirement itself. The core requirement is unpredictability. If the output is non-uniform, it means the output isn&#x27;t fully unpredictable (which may or may not lead to practical attacks depending on the degree of the problem and how the PRNG is actually being used).<p>Meanwhile, you can also create a uniform PRNG that isn&#x27;t secure at all (e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister</a> ).",1373338555

I&#x27;m a New Yorker, so harsh for me is telling me if my brother were still alive my app would give him cancer all over again. In California, I&#x27;ve been told I&#x27;m being overly critical and harsh for saying I think using node.js wouldn&#x27;t work for the application and we should try nginx. Some managers I&#x27;ve had even thought I was mad at them because I didn&#x27;t smile at them enough during the day. For better or worse, people on the west coast are more sensitive to negativity than people from the northeast. Maybe it has something to do with the winters (or lack thereof). :)<p>The point being, the dividing line between destructive and constructive criticism can vary greatly depending on the person and the culture they&#x27;re from. I guess that&#x27;s where the voting from pending to live comes into play. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see where that dividing line lands for the community as a whole.",1373338334

6010813,comment,6008248,6009084,2,0,mhomde,,,"The problem with home ownership is that people don&#x27;t know how to properly value risk the way financial institutions do.<p>One of the more eye-opening assignments I&#x27;ve had was working with portfolio theory for a bank. Portfolio is pretty much hoppycock used to explain for the customer why they bank lost money on your investment. Giving you nice charts for how much risk was taken and how they performed compared to some index. While portfolio theory in itself is BS it demonstrates well how risk is something that has a value, and protecting against that risk costs money (hedging)<p>Texas Hold&#x27;em is the same, what is the risk (odds of winning) and how much can I win determines how much I can bet (invest) in a hand (home).<p>With homes people have no proper sense of the risks they&#x27;re taking. Cognitive dissonance together with a surprisingly short view of history and survivor bias makes investing a home seem like a no brainer.<p>Its often futile to even have a discussions of potential risks with a homeowner because they don&#x27;t want to hear it. Sure the risk might greater or it mighty be less in the same way that you can play russian roulette with one bullet or five, but there&#x27;s always <i>some</i> risk and often greater than you would think in these times.<p>Homeowners however vehemently will deny <i>any</i> risk and keep spouting about how homes have gone up in the last 5, 10, 20 or whatever years and some neighbour who made it rich. In any case they say if the price goes down I&#x27;ll stay put until it goes up again since I have no plans of moving, like the bank won&#x27;t take your home if it goes down enough that you can&#x27;t cover your mortage.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you absolutely shouldn&#x27;t by a home but at least one should be <i>aware</i> of the risks :)",1373338217

I imagine that the mentioned professor thought &quot;Ok guys we need to do something new, meditation is now getting popular lets take a hit on it ASAP.&quot; There are two things that really irritates me about this:<p>1) The fact that they based the outcome on giving up seat for someone. They could as well give them a gun and see who is willing to shoot someone. it has NOTHING to do with meditation.

In fact, the only thing they&#x27;re empowered to do is authorizing FISA certifications.<p>The FISA court has limited subject matter jurisdiction but I disagree that limited subject matter jurisdiction is impossible for an article III court. 
Article III says explicitly:&quot;The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity..&quot; not that every article III court must be empowered to hear an case whatsoever. I contend that this refers to the maximal subject matter that any article III court may consider, not that every article III court must be constitutionally empowered to consider any case that falls under Article III sec 2 requirements.<p>If this was the case temporary judicial courts convened for a specific purpose would be plainly unconstitutional. I am no aware of no one who considers the Court of International Trade to be an article I court because of its limited jurisdiction. It only hears customs cases by law(28 USC 255). This is exactly analogous to the FISA Court/FISCR in their limited jurisdiction.<p>EDIT:
See Kevork 634 F.Supp. 1002
&quot;The defendants also contend that FISA violates Article III of the Constitution because the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court <i>is not a proper Article III court</i> and because the Act delegates judicial power to the Executive Branch. In addition, the defendants argue that the structure of the FISA court denies its judges their judicial independence, making the Court a rubber stamp. These arguments were raised and rejected in... <i>I also reject these contentions</i>.&quot;<p>The court rejected the argument that the FISA court was not an article III court.",1373337723

Under this implementation, len(s) is O(1) and RuneCountInString(s) is O(n). It makes sense to have the default case also be the fast one, particularly since people appreciate Go for its performance.<p>Alternatively, you could store the rune-count in the 2-word struct to reverse the above runtimes. However, this is detrimental for the common operation of converting between []byte/string as well as writing a string to a buffer. Both of those operations are a simple memcpy with the actual Go implementation, but would be O(n) using this alternate implementation.<p>Perhaps you could make it a 3-word struct that contains both byte-length and rune-length; Then all strings take up additional memory as well as requiring more overhead when used as function arguments.",1373336189

I also tried writing it out by hand a few times, and it really is easy and readable.<p>I particularly liked how they included a blurred picture. Sure, you can&#x27;t quite make out the = part of the design, but the general shape (well, it&#x27;s a K) is enough.<p>The one thing I didn&#x27;t quite like was the variation with a serif. It just looks a little off. Perhaps the proportions don&#x27;t quite line up--the parallel lines are too thin and close together. Beyond that, I&#x27;m not sure how to reconcile a serif with the two lines really close together. This is not to say it&#x27;s <i>bad</i>, but I think it could be improved.<p>It would be really cool to see this actually get adopted. Admittedly, I&#x27;m not <i>too</i> hopeful--concept art side projects like this tend to stay side projects--but you never know.",1373335373

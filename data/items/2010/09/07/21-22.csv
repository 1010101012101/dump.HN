I hack on (and around) ruby, rails, js, and sql all day (and node.js by night.)  Epocrates (my employer) is hiring, and this is my “one developer to another” explanation for why you should consider applying.<p>About me / the project / the company:<p>I came to Epocrates because I wanted to have a job that made me proud.  After jobs in email delivery, online video and social gaming, I was ready for a project and a company that does good in the world.  The project we’re working on is an Electronic Health Record system (industry term.)  This includes electronic prescriptions, note-taking, billing, and everything else that makes a Doctor’s office run.  Working in healthcare is complicated, but the nature of the work is rewarding.<p>The company’s existing products are already used by over 40% of US physicians.  If you have family or friends that practice medicine, ask them if they know about Epocrates.  The company is about 10 years old and doing well.  The comp package includes competitive pay, excellent health benefits and everything that you’d expect.  While the company is stable and mature, our project is still new.  You’ll be working on new features and helping the rest of the team build out a v1 product.<p>About the positions:<p>The first is someone with a strong background with an RoR stack (our flavor: 2.3.8, shoulda, haml, sass, jQuery, formtastic.)  You should be comfortable with each part of the stack from SQL to ActiveRecord to JavaScript.  Our UI team handles cutting up photoshop and cross-browser stuff, but we make the views functional.  A normal task will involve writing tests, generating some models, writing some business logic, and cranking out the js to make the product managers happy. If the pageload is slow, add in debugging performance and making it fast.  It’s a plus if you have worked on large/complex systems or a degree in CS.<p>The second position is for someone who might be familiar with RoR but more importantly has management experience.  You should have experience managing teams that have successfully produced working software.<p>Other parts of the company are hiring people with experience in Java, QA, mobile of all sorts and more: http://www.epocrates.com/company/jobs/job_list.html<p>Please send your comments / questions / resumes & cover-letters to my work email ( ablohowiak@epocrates.com )  Please do not reply to the list.  It’s tough to find good people to work with, and also hard to find good opportunities.  If you know someone who might be a good fit, please fwd this.<p>Thanks,\nAaron<p>Epocrates is an equal opportunity employer.

1670237,comment,1669822,1670183,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Business owners control wages only in the event that labor supply outstrips demand.  After the 70s, due to globalization and technology, the demand (in the US) for modestly educated bodies dropped, while the demand for (a comparatively smaller number of) highly educated workers increased.<p>When you can buy steel from China or run a car factory with robots, what do the 20,000 workers that used to work there do?  Google has ~20K employees worldwide and it's worth $175B, the old USX steel plant on the South Side of Chicago has 20,000 workers <i>within 2 square miles</i>.  Tech companies create jobs, but nowhere near the number that manufacturing used to.<p>I never mentioned whether this was a good thing or not.  I think that every person that doesn't get autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward (worth reading the book Outliers just for that 3-item list), society will be poorer overall.  So I think that unemployment and underemployment are huge drags on the economy, not to mention how devastating they are to the people involved.<p>""I personally believe that additional productivity of a worker should benefit the worker not just the employer"" - this happens when the worker creates unique or hard-to-replace value.  I too wish everyone could do this, and it's one of the main reasons to do a startup.<p>""i also believe that there should be institutions in place to promote and foster lower income inequality."" - you can argue that YC is doing this, by teaching founders how to become richer than they would have otherwise been.  The question is if this method (teach people to create more value vs capture value from those that create it) will scale to a whole society.  I personally doubt that, so the question is how much to take from the top, and where to set the floor.",1283896735

I didn't see features, I don't see any screenshots, etc. It would help if the features are more up and center rather than a sign up form.<p>* Related to above... there is no demo or screenshots or anything. I'm not sure if this site is supposed to be dead simple image sharing (like imgur.com or something) or something more. But I'm not willing to sign up to find out. More visual assistance, please.<p>* For a photo sharing site, the design -- while sleek -- is pretty drab. Its a fairly depressing set of colors that didn't evoke any sort of excitement from me. For example, when I visit flickr.com, I see a bright, vibrant image of people swimming. Beautiful. It gets me excited to share/see other images.<p>I'm no professional, just a regular consumer, and those are my two cents.",1283896438

Some of you said that there are Agile consultants that would blame a failure because ""you don't follow it by the book"".<p>First, follow what by the book?<p>Second, what book?<p>Third, don't confuse Process with Principles.<p>Organization failed implementing Agile because the people behind it are still stubborn and still clinging to the old ways of doing things. Yes... this is the reality in our field. We often say things like ""IT, Computer, Internet change the way we do things"", please allow me to finish that sentence: ""... but just don't tell us to change how we build software"".<p>Agile never talks about making software faster. They talk about delivering business value and high-quality software. Even then, quality is defined by the Client, not by the developers/engineers. Some clients were okay with small UI glitches.<p>Scrum is a Project Management technique that uses a set of Agile techniques behind it. In Scrum, after each Sprint, you should have a potential shippable product. How can you have such situation without a good test-automation? Manual test would work fine early on when the list of features are minimum, but it doesn't scale. Remember, a Sprint is usually either a week or two. How can you re-test the whole product every 2 weeks? Hire more QAs?<p>Developers these days pay lip-service when it comes to writing test-automation. They'll dodge any tasks related to test. This happens because of our university/education doesn't teach us that test is important. Testing is usually a footnote in ""Software Development"" courses.<p>The reason why TDD is important is simple: people lie all the time. People are lazy. That's a matter of fact. They would say ""sure, my code is testable, we don't have to write unit-tests now"". By the time someone tried to write a unit-test, you'll hear tons of excuses. Can't do.<p>Now, let's get to everybody's favorite part: Superstar Developer. Yes, they do exist. No, they're not perfect, they'll make mistakes, they'll get sloppy, their estimate went south, etc. Superstar developers write unit-tests. I don't care if they do TDD or not, but at the end of the day, their code should be testable from all angles.<p>Please understand that we are trying to get better in this industry. Developer testing their own stuff is something quite relatively new. There are _plenty_ developers out there that allergic to testing.",1283895412

Instead, they work their way up somebody's butt and sit there pulling checks, wielding unaccountable power that is inappropriate for their place in the reporting structure.<p>It goes like this:<p>1.  People do what the consultants say because hey, you're supposed to be learning from them.  It makes sense.<p>2.  Some recalcitrant people refuse to go along with any changes, and upper management puts out the word:  ""We're paying good money for these consultants.  On my authority, do what they say.""  This still makes sense.<p>3.  The consultants start meddling in things outside their original brief, just because they think they're smart and want to prove it.  People have to live with it, so the consultants are gradually accepted as a generic part of the power landscape.  This is the beginning of the pathology.<p>4.  The consultants continue wielding power in a disruptive way as long as they can, because if the organization doesn't need their constant correction, somebody might realize it's time to get rid of them.

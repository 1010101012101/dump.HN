This is USA in the future. 800 bilion bail-out - printed, over 1 trillion budget deficit - printed, another 800 billion bail out - printed. Only 5% of all the US dollars ever created is in circulation in the US. Rest of them are deposited in banks of the rest of the world as I.O.U.s... treasuries (us gov debt) that was bought by foreigners. The very moment foreigners realize that Treasuries have negative R.O.I. - as it will become true once treasuries bubble bursts and Fed starts printing to pay them off... well, this is how the whole Communistic Block collapsed in matter of months - hyperinflation due to inability of repaying debts. The exactly same thing will happen with the USA. Nation with no production, no savings and the biggest debt in the history of the man-kind... this country is going bankrupt. Kaput!",1231642545

Most people have this idea of what a poly is thanks to TV and movies.<p>All I'm going to say is that polys are not fun for people who are insecure, have emotional/anxiety issues, or go in with the mindset that they have to ""beat the test"" or ""outsmart the examiner"".  It's not a measure of psychological fortitude at all, and anyone who views the test as such will be extremely stressed out by it all.<p>The only legitimate reasons polys are stressful is because they waste half your day, coop you up in a room and tell you to stay as still as possible for most of the 4 hours.

That's because traditional notation is designed to be convenient rather than explicit. They are right, but this does <i>not</i> mean that physics lacks rigour. More explicit notations were always available and physicists, being more intelligent than computers, were capable of resolving the ambiguities to reveal the fully rigorous structure underneath.<p>There's a difference between using a convenient notation and lacking rigour. If you are always capable of discerning the true formal equations behind a convenient notation then everything is OK. If you can't, or people can't agree on what the formal meaning should be, then there is indeed a problem. The fact that the authors could derive a computational notation that no physicist would disagree with is <i>proof</i> that a lack of rigour never existed in the first place.",1231640595

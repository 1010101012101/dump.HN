Which is a good thing, it can be a great place to explore differing opinions and think through your own beliefs, but you have to get people fired up... and Red Sox vs. Yankees is not going to do it. People disagree over which one is better, but there is nothing to talk about. Politics, religion, race, philosophy, Ruby vs. Python, basically everything that ought to make you uncomfortable as a webmaster... and it should, because if you're successful the debates will get ugly in a hurry.

Poll Daddy may be your largest, least obvious competition. Data Portability is another... a lot of those types of conversations are happening in Friendfeed and Disqus now, and that trend will only gain momentum.<p>Routes to success... you have a built in attention base with bloggers - controversy is a major eyeball driver to their sites, and the ""blog 2.0"" trend - the concept that the blogger doesn't ""own"" the debate, they just contribute to it, could be leveraged - they will still be inclined to move the discussion over to wordpress, but less snarky about it.

However, this doesn't mean it's good for you.  Many drugs have those effects as well as significant negative ones.  Alcohol, for example, has quite strong anti-anxiety properties, and no one (that I know of) is claiming getting tanked is good for your brain.  Likewise cigarettes and marijuana (I suppose some folks are claiming that marijuana is good for the brain, as it is attributed with all sorts of miraculous properties by folks who really want their recreational drug of choice to also be a cure for everything).<p>I'm not saying incense <i>isn't</i> good for the brain, just that this article does not say that it is.<p>One could also take away, based on the circumstantial evidence of its frequent involvement in various churches over the past few thousand years, that frankincense makes you gullible, easily parted from your money, and more likely to believe in ghosts and magic.  These are not desirable traits, though all could result, I suppose, from a bit too much anti-anxiety medication.<p>I think I'll refrain from dosing on frankincense for the time being, along with every other drug that I'm being told is good for my brain.",1211386139

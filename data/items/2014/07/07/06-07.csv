7997461,comment,7996980,7997297,5,0,lmm,,,"I&#x27;ve never seen a &quot;bolt-on&quot; type system work, and I&#x27;ve used a few (e.g. JSR308). So I think it&#x27;s something that needs to be built into the language itself.<p>Having used a system with higher-level type constructs I find myself thinking in them. So many complex sequences of operations shake out as something much simpler once you realise the right monad, or arrow, or so on. And it becomes painful to manually expand it out; it would be like working in a language without generics. So I couldn&#x27;t stand to work in a language that can&#x27;t express these concepts; I need either higher-kinded types or something equivalent to them.<p>And for a type system that powerful, I&#x27;d want some assurance it was correct. Theoretical underpinnings are not the only way to do that - if it had been in use a while, and had enough tests and experience to give me a decent level of confidence, that would be enough. But for a new language I think the only way I could be confident enough to use it would be if it had this kind of theoretical backing.",1404716314

When we raise an Integer to a positive Integer (2^2), the result will always be a positive Integer. You would expect the type of such a function to be: Integer -> Integer -> Integer<p>Except, that&#x27;s wrong. When we raise an Integer to a negative Integer (2^-2), the result will be some fractional value. If we want to retain full numeric precision, it&#x27;ll have to be something like a Rational. So now your function&#x27;s type signature is: Integer -> Integer -> Rational.<p>But that&#x27;s also wrong. So what are we to do? Maybe positive and negative integers should be separate types? PositiveInt and NegativeInt, let&#x27;s say. But then what about subtraction? Should it&#x27;s type signature be: PositiveInt -> PositiveInt -> PositiveInt? What about 2 - 3? Whoops!<p>So, there&#x27;s no way, with types alone, to simply and accurately encode all basic math operations. All you can do is throw a Domain Error when someone violates certain boundary conditions, and tell them to check their arguments before deciding which function to call.<p>...meanwhile, dynamic languages will happily return whatever type is most appropriate for the arguments given.",1404715542

7997422,comment,7996210,7997064,6,0,vlasev,,,"I both agree and disagree.<p>On one hand I disagree because mathematics is abstraction built on top of abstraction many times over. It can be incredibly dense with information. An example comes to mind - Stokes&#x27; theorem. It&#x27;s an amazingly elegant piece of math. It can be stated very neatly with 6 symbols - the integral symbol, omega, d omega, Omega, del Omega and an equal sign. If you were to unravel what each of the symbols meant using the closest terms related to them and then did the same for those terms and you continued some more, you&#x27;ll have a small book.<p>This kind of thing is paralled in programming where you rarely want to just push bits around. I imagine you as a person who specializes in assembly complaining about the lack of rigor in more abstract languages.<p>However I agree with you because the above stuff is sometimes just an excuse for writing terribly. Firstly, there are practical considerations about the sheer length of text. Then you have problems of explaining. A professor writing a textbook can be far detached from that past when they first learned the stuff. My own teachers always told me to never write &quot;obviously&quot; unless I also explain why it is obvious (It can be very useful to explain to the student what needs to be obvious and why).<p>The best solution I can think of is writing with the online world in mind. A mathematical paper does not need to be short and concise. I envision two versions - the long online version and the shorted published version. There are after all practical and physical considerations in the latter while the former shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal. In this way whoever is interested in more than the overview can access the longer online version and learn from it.<p>The biggest problem I see in this scheme is that of laziness - not everyone will want to write long texts.",1404715399

7997410,comment,7996798,7996798,71,0,legutierr,,,"I used to work in the money transfer industry.  Years ago, my team and I built many of the systems that Banorte uses to link the organizations mentioned in the article to paying locations in Mexico (and other regions).<p>I left the industry shortly after we sold our company to Banorte in 2007.  I left the industry for the same reason that we sold the company: a nearly intollerable level of regulatory risk.  It got to the point in 2006 where a number of our profitable and otherwise-healthy competitors went out of business just because they couldn&#x27;t keep their bank accounts open.  Their bank would get a visit from an OCC examiner, or would ask the FDIC to approve a merger, and instructions would be issued to close all of the money transmitter accounts.<p>In other words, much of what this article talks about is not new.  Here&#x27;s a very similar article from nearly a decade ago (some of the same people being quoted):<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/16/nyregion/16remittance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/16/nyregion/16remittance.html</a><p>What is new here--what&#x27;s interesting--is the fact that the banks themselves seem to be shutting down their own remittance services.  I had always attributed previous &quot;crackdowns&quot; to regulatory capture: certain banks saw a wealthy, highly-fractured niche, and used their connections in DC to turn up the heat on the non-bank players in order to weaken them and take market share.  One of the most infuriating things about what we saw happening in 2005-2007 was that while banks were closing the accounts of non-bank service providers, the banks themselves began offering the same services to their own customers, often through the same networks that the non-bank financial institutions were using.  Bank of America was the most prominent actor in this regard; but now, even they have stopped offering money transfer service.  Go figure.<p>It&#x27;s really unfortunate that such a cool area of tech (international remittances) draws such negative attention from regulators.  If it weren&#x27;t for that regulatory risk--existential in nature, really--I would still be working in the space.  Ironically, this is also why I don&#x27;t think that Bitcoin is a solution for international remittances.<p>See, the problem here is cash.  No one is complaining about the lack of availability of SWIFT-based wire transfers between bank accounts.  The transactions being discussed here transit through a secondary banking network that sits atop SWIFT; it is faster (seconds vs. hours), cheaper ($5-$10 per wire vs. $30-$50) and more available (24x7 vs bank hours) than SWIFT, but most significantly, because most of its payouts are made using cash, its participants don&#x27;t need bank accounts.<p>Cash payouts are made out of necessity.  The majority of international remittance recipiants don&#x27;t have bank accounts, and the cash they receive from their emmigrant relatives goes to immediate consumtion needs (as mentioned in the article).  Unless those recipients, many of whom live in rual areas, were able to cash out their bitcoins on the spot, a bitcoin transfer would be worthless to them.  And the bitcoin ecosystem faces the same challenges with regards to bank access as the remittance industry does.<p>If you want an explanation as to what is driving this &quot;crackdown&quot;, I would attribute it to some desire to significantly curtail the use of cash in these kinds of transactions.  The low-income people who depend on remittances are collateral damage in service of that objective.",1404715072

It identifies a very real problem, in that many court decisions seem to indirectly rely on arguments made by non-peer reviewed &quot;law review&quot; articles published in venues with poor to no quality control. Some of these studies are funded by companies that have an interest in the results being in their favor, and thus present a vector for industry to subtly influence courts. It also highlights that courts are very aware of such influences, though they are imperfect in avoiding them.<p>But as far as the data goes, the study takes &quot;punitive damages&quot; as an example topic and finds, out of a sample set of thousands, <i>only 14</i> potential culpable studies that were industry-funded. The author attempts to make a case that these studies were more influential than their numbers suggest, but the fact remains that they represent only about a couple of percent of the sample size.<p>At least as far as that study is concerned, it does highlight a real concern, but I could find no indication of &quot;systematic&quot; or &quot;extensive&quot;, or indeed any real &quot;corruption&quot; in it.<p>2. Despite all the whitewashing folks try to do with respect to the Swartz, MIT, Harvard and access to JSTOR, it does not change the fact that he <i>hid his face from the camera</i> when <i>sneaking into the closet</i> where he hid his machine, and he <i>ran from the authorities</i> when they approached him.

The article does discuss SF, true, but SF has only perhaps 10% of the area&#x27;s population, and a negligible part of the area.<p>Housing prices on the SF peninsula once were in line with the rest of the country. Then came anti-development fervor, pushed in large part by existing homeowners who benefited from a rise in demand coupled by fixed supply.<p>That&#x27;s one reason why, even though I have enough land to build a small guest cottage that I could then rent out on the SF peninsula, my local government makes it cost-prohibitive or impossible to do (can&#x27;t cut down trees, can&#x27;t disturb natural habitat, can&#x27;t build within 40&#x27; of a stream, etc.). That&#x27;s also why Facebook&#x27;s massive new campus logically should be surrounded by high-density housing instead of ranch homes on quarter-acre lots, and isn&#x27;t, and why no housing can be built within walking distance of the Googleplex in MV.<p>Thomas Sowell, an economist at Stanford&#x27;s Hoover Institution, wrote about this back in April:<p><a href=""http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20140423-open-spaces-and-housing--the-high-cost-of-liberalism.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20140423-op...</a>\n&quot;There are people who claim that astronomical housing prices in places like Palo Alto and San Francisco are due to a scarcity of land. But there is enough vacant land (open space) on the other side of the Interstate 280 freeway that goes past Palo Alto to build another Palo Alto or two — except for laws and policies that make it impossible. As in San Francisco and other parts of the country where housing prices skyrocketed after building homes was prohibited or severely restricted, this began in Palo Alto in the 1970s. Housing prices in Palo Alto nearly quadrupled during that decade. This was not from expensive houses being built, because not a single new house was built in Palo Alto in the 1970s. The same old houses simply shot up in price. That is part of the unacknowledged cost of open space and just part of the high cost of liberalism.&quot;",1404712800

The reality is that healthcare is anything but a free market, and costs aren&#x27;t going to come down until it becomes one.<p>Every other OECD country except Mexico has similar or better outcomes than the US, at lower cost (per capita and per GDP) than the US, so its pretty ridiculous to claim that the only possible way for the US to reduce prices is to convert the healthcare market into an unregulated free market, which is far from what any of the countries that achieve equal or better results at lower than the US have.<p>The US pays more in healthcare in its public healthcare systems -- as a share of GDP or in $/capita -- than many countries do in their public systems that provide virtually everything through those public systems, and then pays about the same amount again in <i>nonpublic</i> healthcare expenditures. From all evidence, the biggest problem with healthcare costs in the US is the high degree of privatization, not the lack of a free market.",1373835500

If Zimmerman was tried in New York the case would&#x27;ve most likely had a different outcome. Florida has stand your ground laws which allowed Zimmerman to protect himself using deadly force, whereas New York doesn&#x27;t.<p>The cases aren&#x27;t even that similar. The reason Zimmerman was found not guilty was because there was evidence that he was physically assaulted and that his life was in danger when he shot Martin. In the New York case, there was no evidence to suggest the shooter was physically assaulted.<p>All this is is a poor attempt at playing the race card. You can&#x27;t compare two different cases tried in two places with different sets of laws. It just doesn&#x27;t work like that.",1373835498

GDP growth can come from three sources: employing more people; using more capital per worker; or an increase in the productivity of labour and capital due to new technology, say. Since 1970 women have filled two new jobs for every one taken by a man. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the employment of extra women has not only added more to GDP than new jobs for men but has also chipped in more than either capital investment or increased productivity. Carve up the world&#x27;s economic growth a different way and another surprising conclusion emerges: over the past decade or so, the increased employment of women in developed economies has contributed much more to global growth than China has.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/6802551"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/6802551</a>",1373834954

6042168,comment,6040777,6041806,3,0,vlasev,,,"This is a very interesting study, thanks for sharing it. With risk to go against what I said earlier, I have to admit that I&#x27;ve seen the same thing in my own learning and that of some of my peers in my math program. The first two years of math courses were great and we did well and the more advanced ones were, of course, harder but we just couldn&#x27;t do as well on them as we wanted. However, I&#x27;ll argue strongly that it&#x27;s not because our first few teachers were so good, from perspective of evaluation but because the later professors were not up to par.<p>You see, Calculus courses are taught so much that the material has been developed and optimized to an extent that when I took my Calculus courses, I fell in love with math. Even somewhat more advanced courses like Linear Algebra and Complex Analysis are quite optimized for learning. Go in a little deeper into things like Real Analysis, Group Theory, Abstract Algebra and Galois Theory, and all of a sudden, everybody teaches these courses differently. Of course, these courses are taught less and they are not as optimized. THIS, I will argue is the reason for the decreased performance in the &quot;deeper subjects&quot;.<p>Let me use an analogy. Let&#x27;s say your first big relationship is with a really easy-going happy person and you have great times but eventually you have to part ways for some arbitrary reasons. Some time later you get into a second big relationship and this time the other person is difficult. They are battling through a lot of childhood issues and have problems with self-esteem. All of a sudden, you find yourself unable to deal well with this person, eventually you break it off.<p>Now, was your lack of &quot;performance&quot; in the second relationship due to the first one being so good or due to the second one being so crap?<p>Now, from the paper&#x27;s conclusion:<p>> A final, more cynical, explanation could\nalso relate to student effort. Students of low-value-added professors in the introductory course may increase effort in follow-on courses to help erase their lower than expected grade in the introductory course.<p>I have seen and experienced this all too often.

I&#x27;m working something like this for myself using Ghostscript, but someone with more skill really needs to tackle this problem.<p>2. Ever tried to read/skim 100&#x27;s of PDF&#x27;s in rapid succession?  (A common task if you are doing academic research.)  It&#x27;s near impossible.  By comparison to reading text documents or viewing images, reading lots of PDF&#x27;s is SLOW.  Need a viewer that can view PDF&#x27;s as fast as we can view text documents in pagers like less or images in viewers like feh.  My suggestion: a viewer that extracts each page as an image and then views the PDF&#x27;s as a series of images.  (Essentially making reading them the job of an image viewer.)  The trick is getting the sizing and resolution right, and dealing with hundreds if not thousands of extracted images.<p>PDF is great for printing.  It also looks great on a screen (e.g. for casual, occasional reading, or presentations to an audience).  But for reading lots of academic papers or any sort of document in bulk, PDF is absolutely terrible.<p>Postscript development is really an underappreciated area, I think.  How does Apple achieve such lovely text on their displays?  I could be wrong but I have always had a hunch their expertise in Postscript plays a role.

I agree, but you can say exactly the same thing about arithmetic and English, and we have the schools teach that stuff.

6042040,comment,6041267,6041405,5,0,Yoric,,,"I believe that there are two things being discussed here. One is performance. The other is reactivity.<p>Performance (aka throughput) measures the total duration of operations, e.g. how long does it take to display a page once it is loaded, how fast a script will be executed, etc. When Chrome was introduced, its performance was much greater than Firefox, largely due to v8. Some other factors involved were add-ons (it used to be really easy to write Firefox add-ons that kill performance, and it used to be impossible in Chrome), or old bloated profiles (which of course didn&#x27;t exist in Chrome). Now, after lots of hard work, the Mozilla community has managed to make Firefox faster than Chrome. That&#x27;s what is measured by benchmarks, and that&#x27;s one point for Firefox. Simultaneously (and this doesn&#x27;t appear in benchmarks) the Chrome add-on and profile situation have started to show the same weaknesses as Firefox&#x27;.<p>Reactivity (aka snappiness) measures how fast an application <i>appears to be</i>, i.e. the total duration of user-visible pauses, e.g. how long does it take to switch between tabs, or how much one tab eating all CPU affects other tabs. When Chrome was introduced, its reactivity was also much greater than Firefox, largely due to the multi-process architecture. Some other factors involved were add-ons, once again, or old bloated profile, or simply the fact that the Mozilla culture initially didn&#x27;t take into account this factor. It took some time for the Mozilla community to realize that reactivity was just as important as speed. After lots of hard work, the Mozilla community has managed to make Firefox... well, much better than it used to be. Improvements include off main thread rendering, off main thread disk I/O, asynchronous add-ons, etc. Unfortunately, desktop Firefox does not have multi-process architecture yet. This gives a considerable advantage to Chrome in this domain.<p>Work is ongoing to bring this multi-process architecture to Firefox desktop. The task is long and difficult and might, unfortunately, kill a number add-ons, but I am confident that the Mozilla community will achieve it.<p>Incidentally, FirefoxOS has a multi-process architecture already.<p>Caveat: I&#x27;m a Mozillian, and I&#x27;m involved in Reactivity work in Firefox.",1373832334

Thanks to Colin for sharing the link.<p>Some instructors here ask how to set expectations so that students will be ready to take responsibility for their learning and work hard before giving up.

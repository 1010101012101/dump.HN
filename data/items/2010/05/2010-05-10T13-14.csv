The current publishing world is organized so that the publisher, which has much deeper pockets than the author, commits money up front (not just the author’s advance but the salary of the editor and other personnel); if the book turns out to be a hit, the publisher takes on a better-than-50% share of the profit.  This risk structure, as far as I can tell, is independent of the medium in which books are published.<p>Also, when a publisher associates a certain imprint with a book, it advertises something about the book’s contents.  (What image does “an O’Reilly book” or “a Baen book” evoke in your mind?)  That kind of endorsement is extremely valuable to an author who hasn’t already become a celebrity, and an author-editor team working independently couldn’t duplicate that effect unless the <i>editor</i> was a celebrity.  And by the time an author or editor becomes a celebrity, he or she has already built up a mutually profitable relationship with a publisher.  (You don’t see Stephen King or J.K.

Some good images were lost that might not have been legally required to be removed.<p>So what?<p>The Wikimedia Foundation can't be expected to toe the line, deciding for itself exactly what pornography will result in criminal prosecution and just keeping their fingers crossed that the State of Florida will agree with them. The laws on obscenity are complex and inconsistent. American citizens have been convicted of criminal obscenity for possessing <i>drawings</i> of children engaging in sex acts, whose production did not involve any actual child. Perfect discrimination between legal and illegal images is not possible, and they've decided that an error of unnecessarily deleting ""good"" pornography is preferable to an error of distributing illegal images of minors.<p>I've been a Wikipedia editor since 2004, and I can say from experience that child pornography is not some mythical boogieman. It does exist on WP, and it can go undetected for a surprisingly long time.<p>The most recent example I can think of is an article on a medical condition that involves as a symptom the swelling of the breasts in pre-pubescent girls. A photograph was added showing a <i>very</i> young girl standing topless with her eyes edited from the photo, showing the camera her prematurely large breasts. The image caption was a brief description saying that the girl was 13 years old, had the relevant medical condition, and that the uploader, whose username began with ""Dr"", took the photo himself in Brazil. Uploading this image was the user's only contribution, and he hasn't been seen since.<p>It was literally months before any editor looked closely enough at the situation to realize that this might not be fully kosher. This isn't because editors are lazy or naive. Wikipedia is a big place, and catching these things happens almost entirely by happenstance. Once the issue was raised on Media for Deletion, consensus was quick that it had to go. But while the image is gone from WP, it's more popular than ever elsewhere. A Google image search for the title of the article will reveal the image re-hosted across dozens of web sites, which is why I'm being so scarce on the details here.<p>The Foundation has to make a decision on whether preventing incidents like this is worth the downside of forbidding some pornography, the only redeeming feature of which is often that it isn't illegal, should be hosted on Wikimedia servers, exposing the Wales and the Board to the possibility of severe criminal penalties.

<a href=""http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/</a><p>Teaching at KS1 and KS2 is completely micro-managed, with statutory requirements set through the National Strategies on a day-by-day basis. Under the guise of ""disseminating best practice"", the system forces teachers into lock-step. If a child needs a little more time to grasp a concept, forget it. You've got to move on to the next unit, and the next one, or you won't be able to complete your Teacher Assessments. If they are lucky, the child will busk it and nobody will notice that they never learned appropriate use of the apostrophe; If they are unlucky, they will receive the mark of Cain - the Statement of Special Educational Needs. It is a near-certainty that they will never recover from this, and will be treated as a dunce for the rest of their school career.<p>At Secondary level, matters are worse still. Almost all secondary schools are surfing wave after wave of exam-driven panic. The abolition of the KS3 SAT has helped matters, but continuous assessment has kept the pressure on to a great extent. KS4 more closely resembles a death march than anything else; The whole school becomes a machine for getting those all-important marginal students those essential 5 A*-C grades. Any student too far ahead or behind the pace is completely ignored. All other school functions become a tool for pushing up that magical number. Student engagement matters only as much as it affects those marginal students.<p>The primary function of school is not to teach, and anyone naive enough to believe otherwise will quickly be corrected. A school is a bureaucratic machine and the role of a teacher is to follow the Approved Procedure. Your success or failure as a teacher will be measured entirely in terms of how closely you imitate the State Approved way of doing things.<p>If your partner has an ounce of intelligence and decency, I'd advise her to quit right now and do something else with her life. There's a lot wrong with FE, but at least you've got some freedom to teach. In the private sector, you won't be teaching anyone who actually needs your help, but at least you won't come home crying. There are some real opportunities to actually engage with young people in the voluntary sector. The pay is awful and funding erratic, but at least you get a chance to actually do some good.<p><a href=""http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/prologue2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/prologue2.htm</a>",1273497277

In the first three cases I went back to a top or bottom panel because the side panel was ugly and unusable. With 10.04, a right-side panel is actually decent for the first time. It's not <i>great</i> - e.g. the shutdown applet is still too wide and doesn't flip vertically - but it's decent.",1273496946

In the American case they already pay for them through (local property) taxes anyway so they probably have good reason to pay a second time for the private version.<p>4. Would you support the abolition of the Amish's special privileges under which children are withdrawn from formal education at ~14, in contrast to the normal school leaving age? Why are they even allowed to have their own schools? After all they're weird religious fanatics with a self-perpetuating sub-culture, shouldn't we break that up and force them to assimilate by making their children go to schools with normal children?

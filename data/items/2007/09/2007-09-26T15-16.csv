59838,comment,59794,59819,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don't understand the resistance to using multiple languages in one project.  Every time you use an API, you're effectively using a new language.  The syntax may be familiar, but the vocabulary is completely different.  That's the <i>point</i> - through libraries and DSLs, we extend the capabilities of the base language so it's more suitable to the problem domain.  <p>Take a look at the following SQLAlchemy code:<p><pre><code>  select([users.c.first_name + ' ' + users.c.last_name,
          users.c.email, games.c.title], 
       from_obj=[users.join(games, 
                 users.c.user_id == games.c.creator_id],
       and_(games.c.creation_date == datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(3),
            or_(users.c.email.like('%@aol.com'),
                users.c.email.like('%@hotmail.com'))))
</code></pre>
Can you really say that's easier to read than this?<p><pre><code>  SELECT users.first_name + ' ' + users.last_name,
         users.email, games.title
  FROM users
  INNER JOIN games ON (users.user_id = games.game_id)
  WHERE games.creation_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
  AND (users.email LIKE '%@aol.com' OR users.email LIKE '%@hotmail.com')
</code></pre>
SQLAlchemy is a really cool library - it basically lets you write all your SQL queries in 100% Pure Python.  But I doubt I'd use it on my own projects, because I've learned to be suspicious of libraries whose only purpose is to make some other tool look like a language I already know.  Invariably there are reasons why the original language looked the way it did, and the reimplementation as a library becomes incredibly clunky as things get more complicated.  I find I'm better off learning the original language instead.",1190821928

59836,comment,59794,59819,0,0,olavk,,,"Databases are not arrays, although they may be implemented as arrays. The whole point of the relational model is that the logical model is abstracted from the implementation. So if e.g. the DBA decides that it would be more efficient to store a table as an array of columns rather than an array of rows, he can do that without changing the logical model.",1190821801

I couldn't believe the hoops people jumped through just because of their dislike (or ignorance) of relational databases.<p>This data base model is perfect for many applications, and can easily be mixed with other data storage technologies (if you know what you're doing.)<p>Don't like the capabilities of your RDMBS?  Then add what you need to you app.  Indexing, transactions, stored procedures, audit, security, whatever.  The code doesn't care where it's at.  It still runs.<p>Not pretty enough for you?  Then become a mathematician or fashion designer.  Otherwise, shut up and code.

59830,comment,59794,59819,0,0,jimm,,,"I agree with some of your points, but you need to study data structures a bit more. Just because a simple table structure could be implemented as an array doesn't mean that database tables are equivalent to arrays. A primary key is not the same as array index: it can be a type other than integer, and it can be non-consecutive. Indexing columns (including but not limited to the primary key) provides searches that happen in less than linear time. You can't do that with a plain array.<p>Another thing database give you is ACID storage. Sure, you could reproduce some of that using thread-level locking or some other locking mechanism, but then what you have isn't a simple array any more.",1190819833

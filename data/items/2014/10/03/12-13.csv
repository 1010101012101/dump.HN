SRV is irrelevant to this problem, except that using “happy-eyeballs” and requiring A <i>and</i> AAAA has problems.<p>What William Chan (陈智昌) was talking about was where a query for SRV records fail, causing a long timeout.  But this is not the normal case; normally you get an answer (perhaps an empty one) immediately.  And since this has nothing to do with IPv6 and buggy resolvers, I don’t know why this situation should be considered common enough to optimize for.

You want them to understand the basis for the derivations and to have a mental model that will spot if the calculations are way out, for sure, but really you want them to be able to take an overview: know which factors are important, use the engineering tools they have. A practical engineer is going to be using computers to perform calculations (be that chemical processes or electronics or civil structures or whatever).<p>In a way I think we&#x27;re on the cusp of a change in how we need to approach job focused learning. We&#x27;re getting to the point where we&#x27;ve stood on the shoulders of so many giants that if you want to operate at the top you can&#x27;t see the floor any more. By which I mean that maybe the human mind can&#x27;t cope with the full vertical stack in some fields, that we need to have people either focus at the bottom - understanding the basis on which particular knowledge is built. Or understand the top - be able to work with the tools for implementation.<p>Maybe.",1412340864

Ordinarily, a jury uses their own judgment to decide if someone was negligent measured against ordinary standards of care. But in a medical malpractice case, they decide instead whether someone failed to adhere to accepted medical practice. That gives the medical community a lot of power, because they get to set the standard of practice, and testimony about a specific doctor&#x27;s actions is always filtered through a medical expert witness.<p>To date, engineers have not been given similar consideration, probably because they&#x27;re not independent and their employers would force them to abuse the privilege.

We have developed OpenWebRTC over last few years and are using it to build various applications. This will continue, with the difference that we will maintain the OpenWebRTC framework in the open.<p>That being said, we are a relatively small team. For OpenWebRTC to remain competitive as the WebRTC standard continues to evolve and people find new uses for the technology, we hope to get as many external developers involved as possible. OpenWebRTC builds on GStreamer which is a well-maintained project with a active community. Improvements in GStreamer will therefore almost automatically be reflected in OpenWebRTC.<p>To be completely transparent Bowser is not our top priority, OpenWebRTC is. Bowser primarily serves as a demo application for OpenWebRTC and is a good way for people to try out the technology before committing to it. Some people will find Bowser very useful, especially while WebRTC support is missing on other iOS browsers, and we are happy for any value it creates.",1412339829

At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how to respond, but I&#x27;ve settled on saying &quot;you&#x27;re welcome&quot;, even though it sounds arrogant to me. Then you have individuals and corporations who profit on this whole notion that we should donate to &quot;support the troops&quot; at every opportunity we get. Many of us don&#x27;t deserve support. Some of us may make sacrifices at times, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we deserve everyone&#x27;s affection or undue favoritism. We have the same issues as any one else.

Homebrew works against these two principles in multiple ways. Compiling software takes massive amounts of time; if I need to install something I want it now, dammit. In principle, there are some binary packages too, but when I tried homebrew there were not for anything that I needed.<p>Apart from time, compiling software consumes energy, decreasing the autonomy of my laptop.<p>But those are not the main reasons I dislike homebrew so much. My main gripe is that the packages are of extremely poor quality. When I needed something, it was not compiled with the options I needed. E.g. packages were missing DTrace integration, QEMU was missing the one target I cared about etc.<p>I am a Go developer; you have no idea how many problems people have had with the homebrew package. It is garbage. And Go is quite trivial to package compared to other stuff. I simply gave up on helping anyone reporting a problem if he is using homebrew. I ask them to recompile Go from official source first.<p>And then there&#x27;s the whole curl into bash things, gah I&#x27;ll just stop now.<p>The biggest advantage of pkgsrc (apart from quality binary packages) is that I can use the same package versions, compiled exactly the same (to the extent possible) on OS X, Linux, and Solaris; <i>and</i> these are production-ready <i>releases</i> used in production by Joyent (and others) vetted by actual release engineers.<p>And with pkgsrc it is trivial to install from source when you need to modify a package locally (unlike, say, with apt).",1412338648

8405124,comment,8403388,8403388,1,0,nickpersico,,,"TS Austin 2014<p>Techstars Austin was an invaluable experience for our team. It seems like the founders did not factor the opportunity for personal growth when they made their decision. Some may argue that the company&#x27;s growth comes first, but sometimes that can only happen when the founders are growing too.<p>We were the youngest company in our class. We actually used the Techstars investment as a means to incorporate and set everything up. Another factor is that all of us were first time founders. Come to think of it, I&#x27;m pretty sure all 11 companies in our class had first time founders.<p>The Austin program was broken into three phases:<p>Month 1 - Mentor Meetings: For the first four weeks we had dozens of meetings with the program&#x27;s mentors. The mentors were a healthy mix of past Techstars founders, angels, VCs, and biz dev partners. It was exhausting at the time  (5-6/day, 4 days/week), but definitely worth it. We used the meetings as pitch practice, and iterated how we described our business along the way. I also learned a lot about my co-founders in those meetings. Seeing them describe our business to other people was very revealing about how they felt about things. Super valuable.<p>Month 2 - Development: The second month was all about taking the first month of endless feedback and getting to work on advancing our business. We used the second month to build our MVP, speak with potential customers, and build partnerships. The Techstars staff was hands off, but were a big help whenever we asked for it. We accomplished a lot in our second month.<p>Month 3 - Fundraising/Demo Day: The Techstars staff started to get more hands on in the last month to help us with our Demo Day pitch and fundraising plans. There was more structure, but we had the absolute freedom to do what we wanted. It was a bit distracting from our business the last few weeks, but the experience of Demo Day was amazing and completely worth it.<p>I highly recommend Techstars for any company with first time founders. We were able to go from polished idea to MVP within three months, and achieve a high level of personal growth at the same time. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that I now have 50+ amazing new friends that went through the same experience I did.",1412337867

But I don&#x27;t see this as definitive proof of the FBI&#x27;s assertion being a flat out lie. The IP could easily have been exposed in the packet body.<p>What happens if you visited the captcha URL with a HTTP/1.0 request without Host header? If the resulting URL generated any self-referential links, what did they use as the hostname? If the Host header is available the norm is to use this, but if not then the script may use the server&#x27;s FQDN or IP address. If it sent a 301/302 redirect in the HTTP response headers, then that _must_ contain a hostname according to the RFC (it shouldn&#x27;t be relative), so what was used there? There&#x27;s nothing in the nginx config that rewrote such response headers.<p>What happens if you make malformed requests to the captcha URL? Do you get an error page with the IP address embedded, or something that references an object hosted on the IP?<p>These are just two possibilities, and yes, neither would lead to the IP being exposed in the &#x27;packet headers&#x27;. But it&#x27;s very feasible for it to be exposed in the packet body, so it seems silly to hang the entire argument on the basis that one word is correct, without considering the alternatives.",1412337701

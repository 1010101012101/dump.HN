We'd just switch our auto search to Bing/Duck Duck Go/Blekko and never look back. But most ""non-technical"" people are dependent on Google, and if they wanted to use Bing, they would have to either search ""Bing"" on Google and click the link in the results or find a nerd to set it up for them.<p>Real World Example: Some relative of my girlfriend set up her mom's computer to use Yahoo. But she has since been convinced that Google is better and she should use that. So what does she do? Every time she starts up her web browser, she types ""google"" into the Yahoo search box, clicks the link to go to the Google homepage, then does her search there.",1351803556

Knowledge so secret, and so powerful that it's worth hundreds or thousands of dollars.<p>If you really made a 15x return from reading a couple pages, why are you here? Why don't you do it again and again? When are you buying your private jet?<p>Now, it's possible you did make $3,000. It's not hard to make $3,000 off of Adsense, or even as an Amazon affiliate. But you probably put in hundreds of hours of time for that 15x return. Because if you could really make $3,000 in a few hours from following some easy steps in a PDF, you'd do it over and over again.<p>I see plenty of people trying to participate in this stuff and fail to realize that even when they do actually turn a profit, they are making minimum wage when they factor in their own labor costs. Usually they choose not to, because it's just depressing. It's pretty easy to lie to others, but the easiest person to lie to is yourself.",1351803523

Just as there is a critical temperature, Tc, at which superconductors stop superconducting, there is a critical current density, Ic, at which they stop superconducting.  That places a limit on the amount of energy you can store in a superconducting loop.  Then there is also the consideration that Ic scales as approximately 1/Tc, so high-temperature superconductors have a lower critical current density than low-temperature ones.",1351803427

These are individual decisions - not givens, something the author clearly stated (""if having a family is part of your life's goals"").<p>Fortunately for men, there is no age limit (and if we keep our rate of technological progress in stem cells and differentiation into germinal lines, there is no reason why it couldn't be also possible for women)<p>Currently, at least for 50% of the readers, age should not be factored in - opening the door for more iteration of the explore/exploit loop, with the always present opportunity to have kids.<p>I guess I don't understand or I'm missing something, maybe like the preference of dating someone of a similar age (which might then impose its own preference on optimal child bearing age)",1351803403

Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux, Windows, and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. We expect developers to be generalising specialists, ready at the drop of a hat to refine an algorithm, write a tricky integration test, tune a SQL query, or discuss feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles including front- and back-end devs.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.

When a symbol or meme takes hold and gets repeated, it's often because it captures something real  not usually accurate or logical, but resonant  about the thing. It's almost the default case for the details to be all wrong and discredited, yet the image hovers in the truth field of the thing it's about, often closer to the core than any accurate detail. ""Igon value"" is an example. Maybe Gladwell never typed i-g-o-n, and you're probably right to say so what if he did, yet there it sits in exactly the space of glibness approaching charlatanry that (a lot of people argue) he inhabits. It's almost as if there is a force of cultural justice that speaks in symbols, not facts, yet finds its mark anyway. I've noticed this over and over. Some of the best examples are political so I won't mention them here. But I'd like to see an example of the phenomenon where the repetition of the meme really is unjust.<p>As for Gladwell, he's a good storyteller, and part of what makes him interesting is that he glides so smoothly between things that we expect to be made up and things we trust to be factual.

Like laptop batteries, they could have their own embedded controllers that would keep track of each individual unit's charge state and condition.

Since the API itself is fed by the framework, the opportunity for bugs is limited.<p>4. I can think of some people / businesses that would pay for this service.<p>Cons<p>1. I cant quite get why a service like this would limit its requests / month [1]. My take on it was that you are selling the transformation of the data into a service - as a service. I guess the calls / month is to also benefit from the value that your service adds to the data ? Number of calls made might not directly translate to value.<p>2. You are limited to relational models.<p>3. There are tricky conditional requests / data munging / orchestration etc that REST services are expected to take care of sometimes. It can quickly become messy if a client wants this. Is there a translation / conversion layer that can be inserted between the API and its caller ?<p>Some feedback...<p>1. Is there some way a developer can try this out before pitching it to a product manager or a higher-up ? There seems to be no direct way to do that. All plans under pricing are tied to money so some folks might be averse to signing up. Most devs just want to download and hack something out to show someone what a product is capable of. The dev can be your marketer within a company.<p>2. The layout of your site is neat. The call to actions are very specific and targeted.<p>3. I think your product has the potential to be awesome.

Jay Leno on his Jay Leno's Garage series recently remarked on how little his nearly hundred year old electric car needs.

1018439,comment,1017708,1018297,0,0,gaius,,,"I very strongly recommend the book <i>Meditations on Violence</i> by Rory Miller. One thing he mentions is that his police department tried BJJ and found things like, in BJJ you want to pin your opponent on his back because it looks good for the MMA crowd, but in police work you want to pin your opponent on his front so you can then handcuff him.<p>But the really interesting bit of the book is in the description of the mindsets of different fighters. Cheating has no meaning in the mind of the true predator. Martial arts, even BJJ, designed for the ring, can't be transferred to ""real world"" scenarios (the author has worked in SWAT and as a prison guard) not just because the techniques aren't suitable, but because the mindset is wrong.",1261997610

1018432,comment,1018050,1018050,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I'm pretty sure this is related in Peopleware (if you haven't read it, you should), but I'm not sure.  My copy is in the office.<p>A group of programmers were asked whether they preferred music or not as they were programming.  They were then separated into two groups, each group having roughly equal numbers of those who did prefer music while programming, and those who didn't.<p>Group A was then played acceptable music as they solved a programming problem, and gropup B was left in silence.<p>As I recall, the only programmers that performed badly were those who preferred silence, but were played music.  That's pretty reasonable.  If you prefer music but get silence, apparently it doesn't matter too much.  If you prefer silence but get given music, apparently it damages your productivity.<p>But there was a twist.  The programming task given was a series of transformations to a set of data, and was designed so that the net effect was to return the data to its original form.<p>The only programmers who noticed this were in the group without music.<p>OK, so the conclusions are clear.  Based on this story, half-remembered from a book, without references, and without detailed data about the experiment, we can conclude that if you're happy with music then it won't hurt your productivity, but ...<p>The suggestion is that there is some part of your creativity that is inhibited by having music on, whether you prefer music or not.<p>This doesn't, of course, address the issue of using music to mask background noise and distractions, and there are many, many points to make, but it's interesting.<p>Some references on the net:<p>Slides 16 and 17 from <a href=""http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~tyson/classes/630.s07/11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~tyson/classes/630.s07/11.pdf</a><p>Search for the reference to Peopleware on:<p><a href=""http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware1/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=12313&ixReplies=29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware1/default.asp?cmd=...</a><p><a href=""http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.593799.37"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.593799.3...</a>",1261996799

1018429,comment,1017708,1018419,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"For what it's worth, I do believe that Krav Maga and similar styles are potentially the most useful of any martial arts not used in MMA, for the reason that they fulfill a different niche (fighting in non-fair situations), as you state. It is very hard to compare such styles objectively, since you aren't able to practice crippling/disabling blows or fighting with weapons at full speeds unless you are willing to rapidly lose training partners. Thus we are left with endorsements, but that is the nature of the beast. Perhaps some military or police force could teach different groups different methods and measure who performs the best, but even then there would be too many variables to isolate.<p>However, for arts that claim to teach one-on-one unarmed combat, including all the ninja/master/sensei arts, there remains an effective proving ground and their absence from it is telling.",1261996579

1018427,comment,1018343,1018343,0,0,blahedo,,,"It's important to remember that basically nothing has a zero probability and anything that's happened once has some likelihood of happening again---you can decrease the probability but you can't eliminate the possibility.  At that point, it's a cost-benefit analysis problem (and a resource management problem).  However, whether you're talking about air terrorism or health care or child education or anything else, it's often hard to convince a general population of this... and it often ends up seeming like you're trying to throw someone under the bus if you even try.  <i>sigh</i>",1261996464

1018421,comment,1017708,1018209,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"You can get the value of simplicity quite young. 2 years ago, with almost no ""real world"" programming experience, at 25, I already got it.  I am no master, mind you.  I just had the incredible luck of being taught several styles of programming.  My insight about simplicity was then inevitable.<p>Everyone knows that other things being equal, a simpler program is better.  What is less known is that, almost every time, simpler means shorter and the other things <i>are</i> equal (at least from a technical perspective). I still face disbelief when I say this.",1261996055
1018420,comment,1017726,1018417,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I'm going to call fake on it. I've shot a lot of cameras, point and shoots included, and if anything point and shoot flashes are the <i>easiest</i> to spot:<p>- Extreme brightness and blown highlights.<p>- Very flat image due to the fact that the flash is in-line with axis of lens, very few shadows, and what shadows you see is very hard.<p>That picture is very, very much an ambient light picture - there would be the tell-tale ""zombie"" skin tone from a point and shoot at that range, and the people would be lit up like lanterns, washing the relatively dark background into unrecognizability.<p>It would take a skilled photographer with an off-camera flash to pull off that shot without destroying the background, no way that was done with an ordinary point and shoot.",1261996050
1018419,comment,1017708,1018319,0,0,btilly,,,"I agree that quality is an issue in martial arts, and some are undoubtably ineffective.  (Aikido anyone?)  Also many that are not totally ineffective were not exactly designed for maximum effectiveness.  For instance Capoeira.  It is designed for a combination of fighting and dancing in friendly competition to music.  Is it a surprise that it isn't the most effective way of hurting people?<p>Anyways the design goals of Krav Maga seem to me to be to make something that is easy to teach quickly to groups of people that is reasonably effective in nasty situations those groups are likely to encounter.  Groups like military and police.  The goal isn't to make great fighters.  It is to help a police recruit with only 120 hours of training survive the guy who pulls a knife while resisting arrest.  As long as it does that, it has succeeded.  And right now most police departments and multiple military forces are convinced that it is good for that.<p>In terms of teaching MMA central ideas, I'm not sure how it could possibly do so.  Since Krag Maga is derivative of virtually everything else, it doesn't really <i>have</i> many original ideas.  Its focus on dirty strikes is not allowed in MMA.  And professional fighters don't particularly need their lessons carefully broken down for ease of learning.<p>On your related note, I'm not sure why you thought it relevant.  To make my point I talked about the MMA style that I thought would be <i>least</i> useful in the hypothetical bar fight.  That doesn't mean that all MMA styles are going to be ineffective against multiple opponents.  For instance kickboxing offers a lot of ways to take someone out of a fight fast without leaving a big opening for his friend to attack you.  Therefore it is unsurprising that a pair of top kickboxers took out a much larger number of opponents in a fight.",1261995806

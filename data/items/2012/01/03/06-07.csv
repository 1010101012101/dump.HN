This was all in C targeting the PowerPC and included effective double buffering for graphics as well as all the game logic.<p>We then spent another 2 weeks getting interrupt driven sound to work.  This was also in C, but was valuable because in order to understand the nature of the generated interrupts we had to understand the underlying bus architecture.<p>We had 3 weeks to do a basic hardware module (a slave on the peripheral bus that powered some 7-segment displays and generated interrupts when switches were pressed) and then to do the creative portion (which was another slave).<p>Finally, we built the Audio DMA controller, which took 4 weeks.  The Audio DMA controller was by far the most challenging because the rebuild cycle was 20 minutes (terrible EDK) and debugging was difficult.<p>So I'd say about 50-50.<p>It was a pretty cool course.

To prevent accidental global variable leakage, script.runInNewContext is quite useful, but safely running untrusted code requires a separate process.""<p>So IMHO, it's a good start but is not quite there yet, I'm not an expert in security but I don't think just because you are using V8 and a separate process model doesn't mean you will achieve the same level of sandboxing that Chromium provides. In fact, Chromium relies a lot in several security mechanism of the OS:<p>Windows: <a href=""http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox</a><p>Linux: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSandboxing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSandboxing</a><p>OSX: <a href=""http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox/osx-sandboxing-design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox/...</a><p>So if you just want to keep your globals clean, running the code in a separate V8 Context is more than enough, I did it once for a javascript library that was corrupting one of my global types(<a href=""https://github.com/firebaseco/safe_datejs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/firebaseco/safe_datejs</a>).<p>We are in a Cloud era, if you really need to run untrusted code on the server side you should be using Virtual Machines instead of a processes, or even better, create a web hook for your web app. I like the initiative but I'm having a hard time trying to find a use case for this.",1325572550

That is seldom true. If you can't attract talent to the team before funding, getting funding won't change much other than being able to access a bigger pool. And as many here can probably attest, attracting talent is incredibly difficult as it is for many. Attracting specific talent if it requires specialize in-depth knowledge in a particular area is even harder. Don't rely on VC funding as if its the magic that makes your engine tick.<p>That said, I'm also extremely concerned by the fact that you refer to fund raising as VC's taking the bait. They are an extension of your team and they often play a much bigger role than just writing you guys a check. You should reconsider this if that was the way you viewed VCs (angels too).",1325572495

The mix could use some help – the EQing of the vocals pulls the low mids out and makes them sound hollow and the reverb is overbearing (and low quality).  This may seem like minutia, but the quality of your father's voice is such that a rawer, more organic sound would, I believe, make it genuinely come across as more authentic.

Never."" on PG's website, and I thought I might ask the HN community for advice.<p>I am a first-year assistant professor of mathematics in a second-tier state university. I have been a very effective teacher in the past, even in lower level classes, and I eagerly volunteered to teach freshman calculus my first semester here.<p>It is common for more than half of students to get C's and below here, so I decided to be fairly strict about homework, and to assign a lot of it. This proved extremely unpopular with my students. Worse, it didn't even result in improved exam performance, my students didn't do any better than others taking the same class with other profs, despite the fact that I made them work harder.<p>I spent a little time muttering to myself that my students are stupid and lazy, but... ""the audience is never wrong."" it is my responsibility to teach the students that I have, and I want to do it as well as possible. I measure it by a combination of: student happiness with the course, amount and quality of work I get the students to do (within reason), and performance on exams.<p>I am seeking plenty of advice from colleagues (some of which is at least a little bit jaded and cynical). However, I feel HN may well be an interesting and very different place to ask for advice -- most HN'ers have an active interest in math and science, and if you want to make money you have to somehow figure out what customers want.<p>I should mention that I solicited feedback from students, but didn't get much useful other than ""assign less homework"" and ""go slower"".

This NYT, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-about-better-parents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/opinion/sunday/friedman-ho...</a> , article has a link to PISA conclusions about parental involvement from a 2009 study and shows that children with involved parents tend to do better academically.<p>While we're dealing with complex cultural systems with thousands of moving parts, reforming the education system to improve parental involvement might yield significant gains. As it stands now, the system offers little to no incentive for parents to actively get involved with their kid's education. You place the kid(s) on the bus at 7 in the morning and don't see 'em again until 3-4pm or later if they do after school activities. No incentive to get involved at the school during the day or afterwards. As a personal anecdote, I've met several people who view public education as nothing more than day care, kids in at 7, free time until 4pm or later with no involvement outside of ""mandatory"" meetings.",1325570966

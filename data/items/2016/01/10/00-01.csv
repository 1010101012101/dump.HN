I don&#x27;t blame them, games are a lot of work even for relatively simple things, and to get anything done at a reasonable pace you just need to be able to churn out lots of code that compiles on the first try, and when it doesn&#x27;t the mistakes should be easy to fix and minimize the time you&#x27;re spending fighting with the type system (C++ templates come to mind as they&#x27;re often avoided in games no small reason being the cryptic error messages they can produce).

E.g. government becomes increasingly staffed by people who themselves have passed these official tests, gained the Official Seal of Competence, and therefore only empathize with other people who&#x27;ve passed these tests, leaving the rest to their fate.<p>So, you get a government full of people who are brilliant test-takers.<p>The first Men-in-Black movie when Will Smith&#x27;s character is being tested for induction was kind of a commentary on this, in that Smith was the outsider candidate, non-conformist, street-wise but perhaps not big on theory, and his competition were all hyper-competent well-educated civil servant types; and Smith&#x27;s unique perspective was key to passing that battery of tests!

These patterns arise from this fundamental prior.<p>The same way the lack of knowledge of some phenomenons can be described as a flat probability distribution making every point as likely as the other, some other phenomenons are better described as log(x) being flat.<p>For the first case of flat x, it means that adding or subtracting a constant to the variable doesn&#x27;t affect the probability.<p>For the flat log(x), it means multiplying or dividing by a constant always has the same effect. For example, something twice as big is always twice as unlikely, half as big twice as likely no matter your starting point.<p>For &quot;scale&quot; parameters that can&#x27;t go into the negatives (you can&#x27;t have a negative size) the flat log(x) probability distribution is very natural to represent lack of knowledge. I think it is the maximum entropy distribution under reasonable assumptions. For &quot;location&quot; parameters that go from -∞ to ∞, a flat x &quot;Uniform distribution&quot; is more natural.

Generally 32 bit on native or 64 bit platforms was pretty much the same. Emulated 64 bit (where the compiler had to generate extra code to do the math operations) was about .1% slower. (yes one tenth of one percent). In investigating it the dominant factor in program execution was not instructions per second but fetch time from DRAM into the cache. All of the math operations fit in the cache and so executed at full clock rate. As the typical CPU at the time was 1Ghz with an execution efficency of 1.2 to 1.5 IPC, during the 110ns where the CPU was waiting for the next bit of data from the RAM to get into the cache it could execute 60-80 instructions. So generally the &quot;extra&quot; instructions were essentially free for the most part. So Java got 64 bit integers regardless of the underlying processor architecture.<p>Footnote: I have mis-remembered the system performance numbers, the SS10 was a 50Mhz machine. The R4000 (native 64 bit machine was only 100Mhz. That said, the CPU being &#x27;starved&#x27; while it waited for the cache to fill was the proximate analysis of why the performance differed very little.",1452385571

10873525,comment,10873059,10873383,0,0,derefr,,,"Oddly enough, this used to be a feature—in the system architectures of 30-40 years ago.<p>A lot of consoles had no concept of the CPU being the final arbiter of the system being running or halted—things like the PPU and SPU and so forth would just continue to merrily loop on even if the CPU halted, or was executing a CPU-reboot instruction.<p>You can see this in many NES and SNES games, where the game will &quot;soft-lock&quot;: the CPU crashes, but the music (being a program running on the SPU) keeps playing, and the animations on the screen (being programs running on a PPU, or dedicated mappers feeding it) keep animating.<p>But this isolation can also be used deliberately, especially where the framebuffer is concerned. Since systems up until the 1990s-or-so had extremely small address-spaces (&quot;8-bit&quot; and &quot;16-bit&quot; are scary terms when you&#x27;re trying to write a complex program), and since console games were effectively monolithic unikernels (even the ones &quot;running on&quot; OSes like DOS: DOS would basically kexec() the game), frequently a game&#x27;s ROM or size-on-disk would exceed the capacity of the address space to represent it.<p>The solution to this was frequently to actually have several switchable ROM banks or several on-disk binaries, and to effectively <i>transparently restart the system to switch between them</i>. This isn&#x27;t equivalent to anything as &quot;soft&quot; as kexec(); you <i>wanted</i> the CPU&#x27;s state reset and main memory cleared, so your newly-loaded module could immediately begin to use it. Any state you wanted to preserve between these restarts would be stored on disk, or in battery-backed-RAM on a cartridge.<p>This is how C64 games managed to fit a rich-looking splash screen into their game: the splash screen was one program, and the game was another, and the splash screen would <i>stay on the framebuffer</i> while the C64 was rebooting into the game.<p>This is also the architecture of games like Final Fantasy 6 and 7: when the credits list developers&#x27; roles as something like &quot;menu program&quot;, &quot;battle program&quot;, or &quot;overworld program&quot;, those aren&#x27;t mistranslations of &quot;programming&quot;—those were literally <i>separate programs</i> that the console rebooted between, hopefully finishing in the time it took for the console to finish executing a fade-out on the PPU. When a battle starts in a Final Fantasy game, the CPU has been reset and main memory has been entirely cleared; everything the game knows about to run the battle is coming from SRAM. (And the reason the Chrono Trigger PSX port feels so laggy is that CT has this architecture too, but reading a binary from a CD takes a lot longer than switching a ROM bank. Games <i>designed</i> in the PSX era took that into consideration, but ports generally didn&#x27;t.)<p>I&#x27;ve always thought it&#x27;d be cool to re-introduce this idea to game development, through a kind of abstract machine in the same sense as Löve or Haxe. You&#x27;d have a thin &quot;graphical terminal emulator&quot; that would contain PPU and SPU units and the SRAM, and would be controlled through an exposed pipe/socket (sort of like a richer kind of X server); and then you&#x27;d write a series of small programs that interact with that socket, none of them keeping any persistent state (only what they can read out of the viewer&#x27;s SRAM), all of them passing control using exec().<p>(There&#x27;s another thing you&#x27;d get from that, too: the ability to write strictly-single-threaded, &quot;blocking&quot; programs that nevertheless seemed not to block anything important like frame-rendering or music playing. You know how &quot;Pause&quot; screens worked in most games? They just threw up an overlay onto the PPU and then stuck the CPU into a busy-wait loop looking for an &#x27;unpause&#x27; input. The game&#x27;s <i>logic</i> wouldn&#x27;t continue, but the game would still &quot;be there&quot;, which was just perfect. This also allowed for &quot;synchronous&quot; animations—like Kirby&#x27;s transformations in Kirby Super Star, or summoning spells in the FF games, or finishers in fighting games—to just run as a bit of blocking code on top of whatever was currently on the screen, without worrying that something would change state out from under them.)",1452385348

Today a number of police departments have red light cameras the give no tickets. So you might wonder why they are still there. As it turns out they do an excellent job of watching your license plate go through an intersection and recording that on a server. Add that to police cars with their own license plate readers and GPS and you end up with a cloud of data points, with time and GPS information for places in a city where a license plate has appeared.<p>That provides a very valuable database for law enforcement, if you know a car was used during a robbery, poof you know where that car as been, so you are one up on the robbers. Even if the license plate was stolen or the car stolen, you have it from the point the plate was stolen to the present. The ALCU has been trying to get statements about how long this data is kept and how it is accessed.<p>Today you can recognize faces with machines better than you can with humans. A camera can take pictures and store the face data with no other personally identifiable information, and yet when you suspect someone of something you plug in their face data and &quot;poof&quot; you get all the cameras that have seen them and when. Recent laws about trying to protect this sort of abuse not withstanding. [3]<p>IMSI catchers and simply Wifi MAC address catchers for the purposes of advertising (or surveillance)[4] can provide GPS + Time + identifiable number logs.<p>Storage is cheap, 32 bit CPU chips are free, HD cameras are cheap, and software radios can build white-space mesh networks on demand. When you lay a grid of these passive technologies around town, it will become the most powerful tool humans have ever invented for keeping track of, or locating, other humans of interest.<p>The fun part is that private citzens can play too, anyone can put together a fleet of cameras recognizing faces and license plates with a Raspberry Pi 2. And if you have a HackRF One you can pick up GSM bands and WiFi bands to note the phones, tablets, laptops nearby. Call it $400/unit, $40,000 for 100 units (two at every intersection would cover an area of 7 square blocks.

But there are problems with extending this to general non-equilibrium case. I think a mix of oil with water is rather awkward to describe thermodynamically, because it is unstable and it is hard to introduce thermodynamic description for a fluid consisting of many drops of oil of different sizes scattered in water.\nSecond law of thermodynamics can be phrased in terms of entropy, but it does not really involve time at all. All it says is after process involving no heat transfer is finished, entropy of final equilibrium state is not lower than entropy of initial equilibrium state.",1452384300

And the codegen bugs are very annoying, just like black magic.<p>Also I don&#x27;t like the Python-style with no end-marker. I&#x27;ll be glad if Araq does plan to provide another syntax for Nim. But I fear the style war in the community.<p>Things I like about Nim:\n1. Unified function syntax call, which makes my code more OO-like.\n2. Many customizable operators and easy to grasp operator precedence.\n3. The pegs library is small but very nice. I began Nim programming with it, wrote handy grammar validators with it, and finally got parser trees in pure Nim for the ASTs. Really fun.\nNot much, because I hope Nim could be simpler and get the most practical features done right. I am dizzy with its syntax and STL now.",1452384266

Have the VMs communicate with each other for control plane operations (&quot;hey, this directory contains the complete results of stage <x>, one of you stage <y> workers can pick it up&quot; or &quot;I have completed processing the stage <x> outputs for job <5>; they can be removed or archived to GCS.&quot;). This strategy also allows independent scaling of the workers responsible for each stage based on the computational requirements of that stage, since a given PD can be shared read-only with many VMs (with limited performance impact in the many-reader case, especially if the readers are not hammering the same parts of the volume).<p>Another option for truly pipeline oriented processing (assuming the underlying workers can generate data suitable for it) is to leverage something like Cloud Dataflow -- then they&#x27;ll handle the work balancing for you.<p>(note: I work on GCE)",1452384085

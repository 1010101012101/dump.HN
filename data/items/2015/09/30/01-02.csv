10301264,comment,10295658,10297811,0,0,ekianjo,,,"> It&#x27;s also important to note what kinds of jobs are being created nowadays. A lot of them are &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; - make-believe work or elements of zero-sum-games like (big part of) advertising industry. Work has been disconnected from benefit it brings, we&#x27;re literally (although usually indirectly) inventing nonsense tasks because we need to have something for people to do and not starve.<p>You think bullshit jobs are something new ? Of course not, they have always existed. Even some coders have bullshit jobs - there is probably only a fraction of jobs that actually directly bring value, among a massive amount of noise from other jobs that support the other or have indirect value to the said business.<p>But on the whole, there are way more &quot;non-bullshit&quot; jobs that there were ever before, that&#x27;s why I claim you are missing the big picture. There were no scientist jobs before. There were no engineer jobs 150 years ago. There were few doctors (very few) in the same time range as well.<p>> that those hipsters gave brains to the machines.<p>and<p>> now they&#x27;re replacing human cognitive capabilities.<p>No, computers are still very much stupid, there is no autonomous AI in sight - we have just been able to make them do some specific tasks very very well and much faster than humans (deep learning and the like), but in terms of flexibility and learning abilities the most advanced computer program and hardware is far behind any life form on Earth. Are you not a member of the Singularity Church ?<p>> because we need to have something for people to do and not starve.<p>People don&#x27;t work anymore to bring food on the table. Food has never been cheaper. Even homeless folks have smartphones these days - the amount of excess cash that people get out of work far exceeds the money needed to get food.",1443578256

However, I learned a lot just by being exposed to my very smart classmates.  Eventually, in my senior year I matured and started to work harder and got good grades.  Had I stayed at my original high school I would have skated through at the top of my classes without much adversity.

I&#x27;m extremely pessimistic about everyone else getting on board with these studies, though. People are quite proud of driving and their cars.

The site pulls down a lot of JS - jQuery with a gazillion plugins, Bootstrap, DataTables, Select2, d3.js, and Moment.js.<p>- The icons are in SVG, which is good, but some of them are really badly optimized - this icon (<a href=""http://beta.data.gov.sg/uploads/group/2015-06-12-061106.977358icon-environment.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beta.data.gov.sg/uploads/group/2015-06-12-061106.9773...</a>) for the environment category is 128KB (!) which is an absolutely monster for a SVG.

It&#x27;s 2015 - I&#x27;d expect government sites to be accessible over HTTPS.<p>- The favicon is not the icon, for some reason.

Are we really that shortsighted that we can&#x27;t wait a few decades or even centuries for the ultimate energy cure-all? We continue to enthusiastically support a space program, even though we know the practical payoff is a long way away. Why can&#x27;t we have the same attitude about fusion? Traditional nuclear and associated advanced concepts can carry us in the medium term, albeit with some proliferation risk.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that the smaller projects got cut from government funding, and I&#x27;m glad venture capitalists are stepping in and contributing. But it seems that they are outright dismissing of mainstream academic scientists, and believe that nothing useful can be learned from the scientific community. This seems hubristic, and will just lead to wasted resources and good will.<p>Plasma physicists have tried many things over the decades and have gotten good at pointing out failure modes.

Not everyone in this country can be a CEO.  The WALL-E premise of everyone living the fat life (pun intended) while the robots do the work is not viable.  The truth is that this country is made up of people with a broad spectrum of capabilities and talents.  Furthermore, these people are not fungible resources that can easily relocate to whatever third world country that has now usurped their former job functions.  We have already seen large parts of this country&#x27;s population essentially permanently displaced with the mass outsourcing of manufacturing.  These were good paying, stable blue-collar jobs that people who were not born to be CEOs could rely on, live a good life, and raise families.  Now look at the former manufacturing cities.  They did not all magically retrain to be knowledge workers.  Instead, entire communities were laid to waste.  Now extend what happened to manufacturing to skilled labor under your &quot;every job to the cheapest bidder&quot; philosophy.  What happens?  Maybe plastic crap at Toys-R-Us is 3 cents cheaper.  But eventually a large enough percentage of this country is displaced to where society itself becomes unstable.  When this destabilization eats away at enough of foundations of our society, even the wealthy will be affected.<p>Government&#x27;s job is (supposed to be) to take the longview on what is good for a healthy American society, not to facilitate multi-national corporations in their quest to cut every cost they can.",1443575413

I&#x27;ve always thought the problem was that it&#x27;s actually difficult to even come up with a definition of what fair is.  For instance, do you want each district to be as representative of the population as possible?  Or do you want the house of representatives to be as representative of the population as possible?  I suspect that you can&#x27;t have both.  For instance, if you have a state that is 60/40, then do you want each district to be 60/40?  Or if it has ten representatives/districts, do you want 6 reps of one party and 4 of the other?  What is districting even supposed to aim for?  I don&#x27;t think there is one reasonable answer to this question, which is why I think any attempt to answer this question for all states is doomed to fail.<p>The only way I can think of to get both is to increase the number of representatives.  The House of Representatives was originally supposed to scale with the size of the population, and they eventually put a stop to that.  If they had continued, then we&#x27;d have a house with a makeup that matches national polling much more closely than it does now, and gerrymandering wouldn&#x27;t be as much of a problem.

Right now I'm paying a dev to build my MVP in Rails but have taught myself HTML, CSS, and am learning Javascript.  I'd be curious to hear which resources you used to get proficient in Rails--I've checked out a little bit of Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby, Hackety Hack, and a few random tutorials but haven't immersed myself completely into learning the language just yet.  Do you have any suggestions for steps to take to get to the level you're currently at?  Also, about how many hours did it take?  I'm still working my day job but learning/coding nights and on the weekends.<p>Also some suggestions:<p>-Include a truncated list of the latest submissions on the home page and put the input field on top, so users can see what else is being posted without having to click through (although I do appreciate the simplicity and I'm sure you debated that).<p>-When you get some time, put a basic logo together.  Doesn't have to be too complicated, just some typeface/color tweaking a la TFLN.<p>-Include option to tweet out individual submissions (even if you're not the poster), maybe include custom hastag like #kickass or something.<p>Cheers and good luck!",1306994379

I think the design and interaction is great (and more importantly some nicely original thinking).<p>One of the things that really impressed me with the demo video was the access to the file system from touch apps (and the use of open app resources as an extension of it). One of the things that I feel has been pretty detrimental to iOS is the removal of any direct access to the file system, meaning that apps can't share access to a file but have to have their own copies.<p>I wasn't too thrilled to see traditional Windows apps sitting next door though. Yes it's taken Apple some time to get rid of some of their legacy support, but this looks like MS is unwilling to really try and move forward.

The video reassures us that ""of course [the new apps] work great with mouse and keyboard as well, if that's what you have"", but the trade-offs and requirements are completely different.  Just based on the video:<p>- For a touchscreen, buttons must be large and spread out, but the result with a mouse would be a lot of unnecessary movement-- jumping all over the screen.<p>- This also means you can't pack a lot of buttons into a small space (or have a menu bar), which, when done in moderation, is a good way to add flexibility to a mouse UI.  A touch UI would seem unnecessarily simplified.<p>- Scrolling things around is really natural on a touchscreen, but  most mice don't even have horizontal scroll wheels.

2610856,comment,2610530,2610530,37,0,leif,,,"I was an intern on the windows user experience team last summer, so I saw a lot of this new ui.  While I will never personally enjoy it (emacs is my ui), I'm proud of them for it and I think it will do well.<p>The first thing to remember is that you have seen very little of the os as a whole.  You saw a ""desktop"" and some sample apps.  There is a lot to come, and a big part of the experience will be determined by third-party developers, so try not to judge too harshly just yet.<p>Also, it is absolutely <i>gorgeous</i>.  iOS looks like rocks after this.  Big sharp clunky rocks.  Sure, you can pinch and zoom and rotate with some fingers, but that's all at the app level in iOS.  In windows 8 (from the video at least, I didn't play with it in such a mature form during my stint), <i>everything</i> is fluid and responsive, transitioning smoothly between actions, rather than closing one before opening the other.  Where iOS enforces conformity between apps' ui and puts clear separation between them, windows 8 seems to let each app define itself, yet still be somewhat symbiotic with the os itself, and with other apps.<p>Why all the complaints about excel?  Microsoft can't alienate enterprise, and I think we all know how much enterprise hates even UI changes.  You aren't going to do real excel work on a tablet anyway (the most you'll do is scroll around and look at the figures someone emailed you), so why do you care if the ui sucks for tablet?<p>Most importantly, though, I'd like to examine one of Gruber's points:<p><i>The iPad succeeds because it has eliminated complexity, not because it has covered up the complexity of the Mac with a touch-based shell.</i><p>The iPad does eliminate complexity: this gives it an opportunity to break current notions of computing, and this helps users recontextualize the tablet and reintroduce themselves to it.  In a way, it's a My First Post-PC Computer, designed to re-teach us about computers, as infants, to clear the way for better things to come.<p>Windows 8 might be that better thing, or at least the first real instantiation.  I find that it seems extremely futuristic, in the sci-fi movie sense.  It seems like the type of interface we've seen in movies about future societies where computers are embedded in everything, and they all interoperate seamlessly.<p>Notice the emphasis on home networking, and imagine your desktop, with all your pictures and movies, serving them through your house to your TV, your tablets, your kids' tablets, your picture frames.  Your kitchen table runs the same browser as your desktop, and can access everything on your desktop, so you can pull up recipes that you bookmarked earlier that day.  It also lets you know when you have to finish dinner so you can make the movie you scheduled.  Your fridge knows what's stocked (and what's expired), and can send a message to your spouse's car asking them to pick up the ingredients you're missing for dinner tonight.  Of course, when they get to the store, the cart recognizes them and loads up the list too.<p>Of course I've gone a little bit crazy there, but I'm sure you can see what I'm doing.  Right now, we have (or, in about a year I guess we will have) two devices that interact in a way something like this.  The only thing left to do then, is to scale up from 2 to 100.  That's easy, the step from 1 to 2 is the hard part.<p>The point is that windows 8 looks to me like the first real step toward this goal, and the progress is happening exactly in the fact that it does <i>not</i> eliminate complexity, it does <i>not</i> segregate the tablet and the pc.<p>Why do you need to plug your iPad in to your Mac in order to do stuff with it (if this is not the case, sorry, I don't own one and my memory of being told this may be fabricated)?  Because iOS doesn't have all the stuff in OS X that it needs to do things on its own.  Your windows 8 tablet will have all that, so it can function on its own, but it also speaks exactly the same language as your windows 8 pc, so communication and cooperation between devices is trivial, even natural.<p>Of course, I still don't like microsoft, but I have to give them this one.

Managing the expectations of what people should be doing on the different form factors is going to be important.<p><i>If all you need to do is update one small item on the iPad, it's doable. I certainly wouldn't want to use a version of Excel that was designed for a PC on a tablet. It would be a horrible user experience. The only way to make it workable is to write something from scratch. Sure, it could read and write .xlsx files, but under the hood, it would need to be very different.</i><p>Again, you're making the assumption that it was designed for a PC. I think they'll think through both use cases and expose the right functionality at the right times. (Yes, this is an assumption that gives MS the benefit of the doubt but given how important Office is to their profitability, I'm comfortable with this assumption.) Also, it wouldn't need to be very different under the hood. It would just need to be different UI. Yes, bigger buttons isn't going to cut it but UI is so much more than just 'bigger buttons'.<p><i>One of Microsoft's problems with Tablet PCs in the early 2000s was that they were PCs. Because of this, they needed to have all of the horsepower to run Windows and still be portable enough to use as a tablet. This meant that they were always expensive. iPads on the other hand don't need to run a full copy of OSX, so they can be much lighter, smaller, and cheaper (than a Mac).</i><p>You've definitely got a point there. They'll need to address this head-on.<p><i>The best line in the Gruber piece is this: You cant make something conceptually lightweight if its carrying 25 years of Windows baggage</i><p>Agreed, though not completely. Making selective cuts would allow them to maintain the same code base for tablets and desktops. It might actually result in a better desktop experience.<p><i>Microsoft may be primarily selling to corporate clients and OEMs, but they will still be competing with iOS and Android tablets in terms of mindshare and expectations.</i><p>Agreed, which is why I'm excited to see the new UI.

Several people seem to be taking this from the perspective of an iPad attack which is a very narrow minded view of the possibilities here.<p>What MS is doing here (and very wisely I think...  IF they can pull it off) is to produce one OS that works cross hardware environment.   Win 8 it seems to me CAN run like classic Win 7 (and earlier) supporting the plethora of existing Windows apps.  This is a MUST for MS.  But originally MS tried to make the old Windows UI touch friendly, which is a very bad approach.  The existing Windows UI grew up around a mouse and keyboard and MS has finally realized it. You can't make it work for touch effectively, and so they are wisely separating the two.<p>To solve the problem they are wrapping Windows in an OPTIONAL alternate touch designed UI for systems where that is the preferred interaction method.  They have developed a new class of touch apps and a new way to manage the overall UI.  But most importantly they have blended the two forms of personal computer interaction.  This is BRILLIANT to me.  You can now have one device, let's say a tablet, that you can use like a touch device.  But you can ALSO sit it in a dock, with a keyboard and mouse and use it to replace your desktop PC including all those legacy apps and Office programs that are the standard.  When done you undock and flip back to the touch UI to take it with you, but you still have access to all your documents.  Microsoft has for the first time realized that the ultimate device will function in BOTH modes and to be efficient the OS on that device also needs two distinct methods of interaction.  And this I think is what is brilliant.<p>You'll never see an iPad as the primary device on an office desk in its current form and UI. Your accountant or DB admin or whatever will always be more productive with a keyboard and mouse when it comes to heavy ""business"" style applications.  This is what the existing touch UI's can't provide.  But a device that can run no compromise Office style apps, business apps, the millions of existing Windows apps in general... and then pick up and go with a nice touchscreen keyboard, touch UI, web browsing, etc... I know I've used the word a couple times but it's brilliant.  I just hope their execution is up to their vision.<p>Edit...  my mind is running with the further possibilities... they will definitely cross up development between Win Phone and Win 8... so now Windows developers can target the mobile market and the largest desktop market with one app.  I still don't see the future of Win Phone turning around but who knows, this could be a very smart move on MS's part to leverage their Windows developer base and established market.",1306991012

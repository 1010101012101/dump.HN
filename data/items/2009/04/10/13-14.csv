This is a hadoop scale problem.  What's the best way to do this?<p>Of course, finding <i>all</i> the singular values/vectors is out of the question, but I just need the top hundred or so.<p>Does anyone here have any suggestions for how to do this?  The obvious strategy is just to construct a rank-100 approximation and optimize the singular values and vectors so that they get as close as possible to the real matrix. I guess gradient descent or something like that would work.  Are there existing packages that do this with hadoop?",1239371891

The problem is that it requires a rethinking of what programming is and how it's supposed to work.<p>It's difficult to test or examine concurrency interactively. Interactive development and unit testing allow you to answer the question, ""does it get the job done, and well?"" Before multicore, answering that question was enough. With multicore, the question is, ""does it get the job done well, with efficient use of low-level resources, and regardless of the unpredictable interleaving of concurrent instructions?""<p>This is where functional programming comes in, because it makes the leap from answering the first question to the second trivial.",1239371875

A game like iShoot can be put together by a single developer using commodity hardware in less than 100 hours.  This application, once released incurs no maintenance cost in order to generate revenue (see note below).  A developer can therefore turn out additional applications of this class with little support overhead required.<p>I haven't written a Facebook app yet, and perhaps a successful Facebook application can be created using the meager developer resources described above.  However in addition to initial development costs, as I understand it, the developer must provide the infrastructure to run the application (web hosting, bandwidth, etc.).  On an application which receives the volume of users you describe, this can add up to a significant ongoing expense.<p>You clearly know more and have more experience with the Facebook platform than I do, if I am incorrect in my statements please enlighten me.<p>*of course you can continue to spend money on promotion and advertising, but since this applies at least equally between both platforms, I consider it implicit.",1239371871

These things verge on what used to be called AI, and require a different level of complexity from things like operating systems and web browsers, even though the codebase might be smaller.  I think there's a complexity problem that hasn't been solved (though procedural, OO, and functional programming were all supposed to solve this, to one degree or another) in any mainstream programming methodology.  It's possible that it's solved in academia, but most academic solutions for things in computer science take many years or even decades to reach mainstream programming, for whatever reason.",1239371370

556011,comment,555666,555918,0,0,anamax,,,"> I haven't actually used GAE and assume BigTable is another database platform.<p>Background: GAE doesn't provide access to BigTable.  It provides access to GAE Datastore which is built on top of BigTable.  Both are key-value stores.  I don't know how much indexing that bigtable provides, but datastore has a fair amount (under user control).<p>There are no joins or aggregations in the GAE query API and queries can only return one type of object.  (The provided subclass/roll-up model seems a little odd.)  These constraints seem baked-in.<p>The transaction model is basically ""all objects under a given root name can be updated/created/deleted as an atomic operation.""  (Within said atomic operation, a given object can only be written once and I forget whether reads see writes.)  This makes it hard to do certain sorts of real-world transactions.  (Imagine transferring money between two accounts.)<p>The datastore also has certain size and ""number of object"" limits.

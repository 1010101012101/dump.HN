Hopefully, with the advent of more sophisticated automation, many of our more tedious jobs won&#x27;t need humans to do them.</i><p>Well, yes, but with society norms as they are now (ie. where money dominates all) those humans wont be needed anymore either. The will be homeless, living in slums, getting by on whatever they manage to find, etc.<p>(And no, new, less tedious, etc jobs are not automatically and as if by magic made available, and when they are, they don&#x27;t take as many people as the manual jobs before. In fact, even the services industry -- the traditional way to create non-essential jobs to employ people when the core industry jobs didn&#x27;t need them anymore -- has been getting automated).<p>For automation to have a positive impact we will also have to rethink how people get employed and paid.",1400965161

The take-away is to stay curious and keep learning even if, most likely, you will never find excitement in your life of corporate monotony, which is of course how many people view paths like CS. From the article, &quot;Most people will have to choose between &#x27;doing what they love,&#x27; and pursuing the more mundane promise of a stable paycheck and a promising career path.&quot; I think this is a false dichotomy common to a lot of college aged students.<p>I was like this for a while, working in restaurants and the sort before going back to school, and in these jobs you find a lot of people who are afraid to place a bet on a career so they can focus on some wholly non-unique set of &quot;interests&quot;. I noticed that few of these people actually pursue these supposed passions to any real extent, and most of these interests were strictly of the creative, non-pragmatic category.<p>I figured that such jobs offered flexibility from the rigid 9-5, and would allow one to pursue these &quot;interests&quot; more freely. This is not the case. Working a developer job you have mental stimulation from learning new things and getting things done. This is normalized of course, and so it&#x27;s important to remind that working odd jobs while you &quot;write your novel&quot; is entirely devoid of such stimulation, and I believe, actually and actively kills brain cells. And this is the path the author suggests many of our &quot;undecided&quot; college graduates will go? Say it ain&#x27;t so! If you want to write a novel or learn to paint, and if these are genuine passions, you will make time after work and on the weekends.<p>It&#x27;s less about &quot;finding your passion&quot; than it is developing a discipline to work on big projects that is completely absent from high school and non-STEM college education. Take your average &quot;undecided&quot; and finance them for a year to follow their passion. A few will make something of their time. Harper Lee did, writing To Kill a Mockingbird uninterrupted for a year thanks to donations from friends. But most will not for the same reason many of us developers (mundane corporate drones) struggle with our own interests and side projects--- because we all lack the discipline. Bukowski summarizes this &quot;myth of creativity&quot; well: <a href=""http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/10/04/charles-bukowski-air-and-light-and-time-and-space/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/10/04/charles-bu...</a><p>It feels good to solve hard problems and challenge yourself. Doing so at work acts as a momentum towards your other goals and interests, and with persistence, lead to a discipline of continued creativity.<p>In case you have not read PG&#x27;s high school graduation  talk, I highly recommend it.

It was missing too many features like a real keyboard, copy/paste, and GPS.  But those commenters were so busy being Right On The Internet that they missed the larger point: it wasn&#x27;t a smartphone, but it wasn&#x27;t a conventional phone or feature phone, either.  It was something else, a product category unto itself.  Just like the peanut gallery on Slashdot, most of the industry heavyweights didn&#x27;t understand that fact until it was way too late.

Cisco has a fundamental need to write high-security code because what they are selling is highly-secure infrastructure. That same need doesn&#x27;t exist for other entities, and it <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> exist, because that security comes at financial and usability costs, at the least. That isn&#x27;t to say that software developers shouldn&#x27;t employ best practices and strive for secure code, but security is not a boolean, and it seems somewhat naive to equate &quot;many people write imperfectly secure code&quot; with &quot;nobody cares about security&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a middle ground between security being a &quot;debacle&quot; and it always being a persistent threat. Bugs exist - and will always exist. You can spend lots and lots of money making sure that fewer bugs exist in your code, and you can spend lots and lots of money writing in-house code or auditing external code, but unless there is economic incentive to do so (&quot;a security breach in our difficult-to-update firmware will leave our company devastated&quot;), spending those resources makes very little sense. Additionally, all it takes is <i>one</i> bug to bring your massively expensive hyper-engineered software to its knees, as we saw in the Cisco case.<p>Security is always not about writing perfectly-engineered, hyper-secure code. It&#x27;s about tradeoffs between financial resources and usability, and it&#x27;s about mitigation of potential damage. If you write code predicated on &quot;this is so well written that it can never be broken&quot;, you&#x27;re in for a bad time.",1400962714

Unlike the Chinese writing system that it bears superficial resemblance to, Hangul is an alphabet, and it&#x27;s more purely and consistently phonographic than most writing systems in widespread use. Many of the letter shapes are actually based on things like tongue position and mouth shape when making a particular sound - and there&#x27;s only roughly as many of them as there are Latin letters. It was specifically designed to be fast and easy to learn, to promote mass literacy. (Both the scientific rigor and the noble motivation that went into it, and the resulting elegance, give it a lot of geeky appeal really.)<p>So it&#x27;s actually quite easy to pick up and be able to read it fluently (you can have your first successes within 15 minutes, and have it pretty much down within days).

Or if not that, then the same sort of thinking and methodology could lead to new truths about what makes a good Hangul typeface.<p>I think what might actually be keeping designers from it though is the awareness that Hangul design is embedded into a very different typographic lineage, i.e. Chinese calligraphy and such. Their own Latin designs frequently pay homage to the past - reviving Caslon is a good example - and it must be a stark naked feeling to lack the same sort of historical and cultural awareness when trying to navigate Hangul typography. It definitely takes a lot of ego for someone from the West to show up and say they can just make a better Hangul font, I suppose - but I still wish more would be that ballsy.<p>After all, eyeballs and computer screens work the same everywhere.",1400961852

And third, as Mr Piketty notes in his response, Chapter 10 is not the only analysis of wealth inequality out there, and forthcoming work by other economists (some conclusions of which can be seen here) suggests that Mr Piketty&#x27;s figures actually understate the true extent of growth in the concentration of wealth.",1400961767

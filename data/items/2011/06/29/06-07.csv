One such feature was ""Twitter integration"" on a locked down, behind-the-firewall corporate product, another was ""GPS support"" for a desktop application.<p>Whenever a team member got tired of all this and left, he would go through a routine of badmouthing them, claiming he had fired them because they were harming the company. Despite a fairly potent team behind him, the company regularly fell out with customers due to not being able to deliver on the nonsensical promises he had made.<p>After a while, despite his excellent bullshitting skills, the company had earned a reputation for not delivering on promises and the remaining staff had little to do other than hand over projects to whoever the enraged customer had appointed to take over.

The right way to approach this is to offer a detailed explanation, not to only say that electric cars burn coal. Its a true statement, but it leads to misconceptions.<p>I will say what I always say at this point: electric cars are about enabling large scale infrastructure change. A gas powered car will burn gas now and in twenty years. An electric car burns (mostly) coal now but it doesnt have to in twenty years. Thats what electric cars are all about.<p>Now, an electric car you buy now likely wont survive until a large portion of our energy comes from carbon neutral sources. We dont even know whether we will be able to pull that off at all. Why then buy electric cars? Why sell them? Why subsidize them? The reason for this is that changing every gas powered car to an electric car takes time and requires a lot of infrastructure and testing. We really shouldnt start building electric cars only in forty years, we should start right now.<p><p> Whether we should work towards being carbon neutral, whether thats possible at all and makes sense is certainly controversial. For the purpose of this article I just assumed that we should.<p>There are other possible benefits of switching to electric cars. For one it makes us less dependent on oil.

We're looking for folks who aren't scared of being hands on with everything. Willing to compile a grsecurity Linux kernel? Troubleshoot network packet loss? Scale databases? If youre able to take on a wide range of responsibility, this position is for you.<p>Your job will be to create an environment where 4 million users and over 1.5 million workspaces can flourish and change the way people work. You'll get the freedom to do the job right, and a fantastic engineering team to back you up. What are you waiting for? Mail your resume and a short paragraph of why you'd like to join to jobs-ops@pbworks.com.<p>What You'll Be Doing:<p>- Physical server management: Managing a cluster of about 70 physical servers in San Francisco. Plus 3 servers in Sacramento. Plus a handful in our office in San Mateo.<p>- Engineering: Developing ops infrastructure tools in PHP, Perl, Ruby, or shell scripts.<p>- Automation: automating deployment with puppet.<p>- Monitoring: using Ganglia and monit to understand what's going on with the systems.<p>- Networking: Running the network infrastructure, including routers, switches, and site-to-site VPNs between the three locations above.<p>- Databases: Managing a handful of MySQL databases: advising developers on schema changes, keeping the databases reliable, and optimizing performance.<p>- Security: Analyzing the systems' security, keeping up with new threats, and recommending and implementing new security technologies and policies.<p>- Email: Ensuring the best possible outgoing email deliverability, and that we don't lose any incoming email.<p>- Office IT: running the office network; operating the employee VPN; occasionally fixing a printer or troubleshooting someone's laptop.<p>- Planning: Monitoring resource utilization trends; budgeting; planning for growth.<p>The Operations Engineer role is extraordinarily wide. If you've got software development experience, there are a variety of customer-facing infrastructure projects that may interest you. If you like NoSQL, there are definitely ways we can add NoSQL databases to optimize performance and developer productivity. We're looking for someone with a wide range of experience and interests, but if you haven't already worked in all these roles, we're here to help you learn.<p>Requirements: 3+ years experience running a production cluster. Debian and SaaS experience strongly preferred.<p>Bonus: Knowledge of PHP, puppet, git, quality programming abilities, computer science chops, and an understanding of SaaS business.<p>Technology: You'll get to solve real business problems with a wide range of technology.

You'll sit in on every team engineering meeting and have input to decisions at all levels. As part of your job, you'll continue to architect our system to handle failures so you won't get paged when a hard drive fries. We're committed to providing the resources so that these failures don't become emergencies. We value automation and addressing the root cause of issues so they don't happen again.<p>To apply, email jobs-ops+hn@pbworks.com.",1312221504

Whenever a big company wanted to do something, it could create a new, small, special-purpose company--which just happens to have employees that used to work for the big company, who are paid exactly the same as they were before, and which shares an office with and gets funded by the big company, and so on--to develop the new product.  It'd license all of its existing patents to the small company, too [actually, that'd be unnecessary, if the small company has opted out of the patent system].  And maybe the small company would refrain from applying for a patent on anything, but it'd allow the big company (exclusively) to learn what it does, and the big company would apply for (and get) the patents.  Only the patents wouldn't do much good, because other companies that followed this strategy would probably be invulnerable to patent lawsuits.",1312221471

Sure it's easy for an intern to get up on his soapbox and proclaim, ""We should stop supporting IE6 because that browser came out while I was still in elementary school.""  But when you look at the how many people still continue to use it, deprecating support is on a case-by-case basis, and it is irresponsible as web developers to just ignore that it even exists.<p>I would actually argue that Google Search is still supporting IE6, just as a degraded experience.  Dropping support all-together means they just ignore it exists, which is far from the truth and likely won't happen for 5+ years.",1312220127

Google for the title and you can read the full version from Google's cache.<p>If the article is to be believed, Barack Obama's role in the planning is quite impressive.  He choose the riskiest of the options offered to him; the military consensus was leaning toward heavy bombing that would have guaranteed civilian casualties, but would minimize exposure to U.S. personnel.  Apparently, Somalia still looms large in the memories of military leadership.<p>Obama took the bombing option off the table completely, and told them to do it the Hard Way -- sending commandos 128 miles into Pakistan's interior.  But the best part is that Obama explicitly equipped the SEALs to blast their way out if the raid went bad and Pakistanis showed up shooting.  That as opposed to throwing up their hands and surrendering, and then letting the diplomats try to arrange their release in the ensuing months (or maybe years; it took us months to get back one single CIA contractor arrested earlier this year).  From the article:<p>""Mr. Obama directed Adm. McRaven to develop a stronger U.S. escape plan. The team would be equipped to fight its way out and would have two helicopters on stand-by in case of an emergency.""<p>Now that, my friends, is risky.  The ways in which this thing could have gone bad are almost too ugly to contemplate.

As a counter-example, Map-Reduce has exploded since Yegge's post, as a way to get practical parallel speedups for certain kinds of tasks, without even having to think about race conditions, deadlocks, etc.  Now Map-Reduce isn't useful for all the same problems as multi-threading, so one isn't going to replace the other, but it's just an example of an area where the multi-threading paradigm fails.",1312219992

That was my point about how taxes work.<p>Regarding your point about regions,<p>A)  The tax is on the consumers, not on amazon.com (or equivalent, proper noun provided to eliminate pronoun confusion).<p>B)  Whether or not amazon.com 'exists' in that region, they're certainly doing business in it, no?  Otherwise there'd be no taxes to collect.  Brave new world, used to be it was impossible to do business somewhere you didn't have a shop, mail order was nothing close to the web.  That's why tax codes and enforcement methods need to be updated for the 21st century.  It's less competitive and less capitalist to have different tax codes for the same goods (or even different goods, IMO, with rare exceptions).",1312219320

If you're testing N different pieces of your site, trying Ni changes for each, and some of the variables are dependent on each other (which is almost certainly the case), then doing local improvements to each part is as likely to make the result worse as it is to make it better.

Which essentially means that you should avoid making a living doing something which does harm to other living things. One of the listed livelihoods to avoid is being in the business of making weapons.  This really struck home when I was working for a company doing a lot of DARPA work. I had previously worked in Universities and in a small community organization.  I have to say going home at the end of the day at the previous positions made me feel good about myself in a way that cannot be replaced with increased income. It was disheartening to know that if I worked my hardest at the DARPA company, all I did was essentially help the US military kill people better. I eventually left that position to go work for a state university.<p>So I do strongly think that no matter how interesting the problems, and no matter how good the pay one should avoid working in areas that do cause harm to others.<p>Unfortunately the world we live in is a bit more complicated that than one the Buddha lived in, so answering the question ""Does what I do cause harm to others?"" is a bit trickier to answer. I personally don't know if selling ads meets that qualification, I certainly don't think that merely making a profit does, and I don't know enough about the field to know about HFT and the like.

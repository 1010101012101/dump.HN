300146,comment,299451,299451,0,0,thwarted,,,"I once had a boss who refused to buy the programmers Pentium machines and made us use 486s instead.  He said it wasn't because he was cheap, but it was so that if we wrote code that ran really fast on a 486, just think how fast it will run on a Pentium.  Nevermind that none of the new Pentium features, like SIMD, could be taken advantage of.<p>That company is no longer in business.",1221025847

Its necessary but not sufficient. However I should have been better in giving him respect because he'd probably agree with me about luck.<p>I just react badly to anything that includes ""Kevin Rose"" in the same class with a billionaire.",1221024969

In theory, I'd like to know whether I'm at a risk of various diseases so that I can take measures to reduce my risk. The list of diseases seems substantial and has grown since the last time I checked it out:<p><a href=""https://www.23andme.com/health/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.23andme.com/health/all/</a><p>However, I'm not sure how useful this information is in reality. I remember reading an interview with a physician who said that knowing one's family history of various diseases is probably more reliable than this test. Also, I have no way of knowing where my personal genetic information would end up if I used this service.",1221023739

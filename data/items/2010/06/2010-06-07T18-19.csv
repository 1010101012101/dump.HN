The other Java web development tools I'd seen all primarily featured a suffocating bureaucracy, but this one pulled a number of tricks to appear almost as concise as Ruby.  My take-away was that Java didn't have to be as repetitive as I'd thought, just that most of the Java libraries were written to encourage that.  Maybe that's easier to make Java more productive than Ruby more efficient.",1275937181

How are you going to get an infinite amount of computation in finite time with a cellular automaton or a computer made out of discrete components?  The only chance of realistic technobabble is quantum effects.  That way, you can pull all sorts of mumbo jumbo like ""doing infinitely many things in parallel"" or ""teleporting the results of computation across space without violating causality"" or ""expressing the future of a simulation in the binary expansion of real number.""  And the story simply wouldn't work without a deterministic universe.<p>P.S. I'm not the author.",1275937138

Other features are making me strongly consider switching to an Android phone. I know the mantra here is ""design is everything, feature count is unimportant"", but I think that is an oversimplification.

I'm very pleased that HN isn't as one-dimensional as some other sites; it's what keeps me coming back.<p>But it is weird, what becomes popular and what doesn't. For example, I submitted this particular story, which I was a bit unsure about (like you say, more suited to Reddit), but still people vote it up.<p>Other times, I can submit content that I think is genuinely interesting/fascinating, that is much more technical and comprehensive than this rather silly BBC/URL story, and it doesn't get a single vote. Maybe it's the time of day / day of the week.<p>On that note, does anyone know of any data repositories for Hacker News front page items? An API or raw-data download that can be analyzed?

I will certainly grant that Economists and Business people need to have these ideas battered into their thick crania, however it's irritating to have the speaker present ideas as if they were novel which are not only <i>not</i> novel, but actually <i>thousands</i> of years old.<p>If you pay people well enough to decouple their concerns about economic survival from their work, it shouldn't be surprising that there isn't a relationship between increased reward leading to increased performance.  That's a pretty fundamental part of the humanist movement which predates the French and American Revolutions (Liberté, égalité, fraternité! or Americans might prefer Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness).  Even then, Humanism was merely the popularization and egalitarian movement to provide for everyone the model which the wealthy and elite have been following since at least the time of Aristotle!<p>Put succinctly, this guy isn't describing the Open Source movement, he's describing at least 2500 years of Academia.  You pay people a tenured salary, because they, free of concerns regarding economic security, will produce works for the benefit of all.<p>And this is telling for two reasons.  First, Academia is not free from woe and misery.  Second, and i would hope that Economists would realize this, just because you have (partially) removed monetary incentives, does not mean that there is no currency or economics in Academia.

Only 1/2 of that gets taken out of their paychecks.  The other 1/2 is paid by the employer (social security wage base is $106,800 and unlimited for medicare).  Also, in most states employees do not have to pay into unemployment.  The employer pays into that for them.  They also usually get vacation/sick pay and health insurance benefits.  A one owner S Corporation has to pay in the full 15.3% on their wages plus $434 into FUTA that he/she cannot use.  In addition they have to pay for their own health insurance and obviously no vacation/sick pay.  Please do not compare employees to business owners.  Employees have NO idea.  This HR 4213 bill is another attack on the small businesses probably because the politicians cannot control us since most of us are free thinkers and usually not tied to one party.  The S Corporation has been around for 50 plus years and has been a blessing to us small one-owner firms.  I pay myself a reasonable wage (what I would expect if I work for someone else in my line of work) and then I usually leave a good chunk of money in the company savings account and take a small amount in shareholder distribution.  With this new bill even amounts I don't take out will be subject to SECA.  I usually save about $3,000 per year in SECA because of the S Corporation.  This might not seem like alot to most people but an extra $3000 to my family seems harsh.  Why am I being penalized when bigger firms won't be?

For these groups having a strong resume of real-world problem solving, and being able to discuss this in detail will be most valuable.<p>So, IMO, it depends somewhat on what career path you want.

I just don't hold the opinion that taking the other extreme is productive.<p>There's the obvious prime example: drugs manufacture.  The cost to research drugs and then test them is astronomical, while the cost of producing them is often very low.  Much of the cost of the drug then, pays for the original research.  It takes quite some time for the drugs to pay back the research cost.<p>What, then, is the solution to making money in this sector without intellectual monopolies?

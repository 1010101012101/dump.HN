Quoting from the text describing the table:<p><i>For example, an overnight PDCF loan of $10 billion that was renewed daily at the same level for 30 business days would result in an aggregate amount borrowed of $300 billion although the institution, in effect, borrowed only $10 billion over 30 days. In contrast, a TAF loan of $10 billion extended over a 1-month period would appear as $10 billion. As a result, the total transaction amounts shown in table 8 for PDCF are not directly comparable to the total transaction amounts shown for TAF and other programs that made loans for periods longer than overnight.</i><p>Your <i>fully unreturned</i> is incorrect, many of the loans used to create those totals were payed back the very next day after they were made.<p>A more interesting analysis would show a plot of the outstanding loan balance each institution maintained over time.",1419170220

Your system encourages this, and so almost nobody will graduate your system in 8 years; anyone who faces such overwhelming blockades will naturally drop out rather than overcome them. I contend that your idea is worse than the existing system.<p>One of the best ways to get a student to understand content they are completely stuck with is to introduce and apply it as part of a more advanced topic or more practical context, i.e. just move them on from the part they are stuck with and let them continue, coming back to earlier topics where relevant (and as a necessary reminder to the others).

8779732,comment,8779274,8779720,0,0,atoponce,,,"No. You missed it. The OP stops filesystem checks happening fairly regularly. The great thing about computers, is identifying when you are repeating a behavior, to either have the computer automate your behavior for you, or to change your behavior entirely.<p>I am fully aware that the OP wants to cancel the fsck(8) in progress, and I am aware of both of the Debian and Systemd bugs in place to address the issue. Arguing on the Internet about whether or not he can or should Ctrl-C an active check, certainly when bugs already exist for both projects, is pointless.<p>Instead, to prevent additional filesystem checks, there are tools to make this possible. Unless he likes getting frustrated that he cannot press Ctrl-C during a check on boot, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. His system is booted now, so he has some options available to him:<p>* Do nothing, so the OP cannot press Ctrl-C on the next check.<p>* Disable filesystem checks from future boots.<p>* Switch from Systemd back to SysV Init.<p>The concept of &quot;going back in time&quot; during an active check, to change a kernel parameter, so it doesn&#x27;t start to begin with is a strange one.

Apart from some normal stuff they spend it on luxury goods – iphones, bentleys, jets, yachts, depending on the level. Showing off your status like that is exceedingly popular in Russia.<p>At the same time, Russia produces very few such goods and thus much of this money simply flows out of the country. Besides, rich people spend a much lower percent of their income than the average Ivan does, so they park their savings offshore – in foreign bank accounts, real estate, etc. The reason they do it is because anything they have in Russia can be taken away in a matter of hours if they ever find themselves on the wrong side of the power field.<p>So yes, as you see corruption leads to capital outflow which is a real problem in Russia. In fact, we had some new laws passed to address that, not sure about the extent or effectiveness.<p>You&#x27;re right though, Russia is beginning to see resource exhaustion – easily accessible forests, oil fields, etc. are gradually drying up.

Do founders who passionately believe in something convince you?<p>I feel very sympathetic to the argument of your essay, for many reasons, and have grown to use the same meta-belief of believing in change; however, instead of sidestepping the problem, I tackle it heads on, by incorporating Doubt and Relativism in my decision making. \nI feel, and strongly believe ;), that Relativism is the cure to many cognitive biases; if you doubt yourself you can&#x27;t be affected by the Dunning-Kruger effect; I think everybody should train themselves in managing the unavoidable cognitive dissonances of day to day life, it would make the world a better place. Relativism is also an important tool for creativity: the moment you doubt your frame of reference, you start seeing the picture outside of the box, new possibilities open up.<p>Of course Relativism has it&#x27;s shortcomings, and beliefs, which are rooted in emotions, command our behaviours more powerfully that the logical reasonings of Relativism. \nHowever, I believe, there are ways for us to be both &quot;passionately convinced&quot; and relativistic at the same time; \nI try to be like Cezanne, who would ask himself: &quot;is this what I see?&quot;",1419168151

8779679,comment,8778253,8778884,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Currently there is a lot of concern about &quot;child rearing&quot; but very, very little about raising a child to adulthood. So much so that for most people it tends not to occur until the mid to late 20s these days, and then only sort of by accident/osmosis.<p>Today we decry &quot;child labor&quot; but there is a lot that the traditional apprenticeship model had going for it. For one it gave young adults important job skills and introduced them to the job market, which not only jump starts one&#x27;s career and financial self-sufficiency but also inculcates responsibility, belonging, and self-esteem (because teens see that they are capable of doing valuable work, capable of learning in a way that produces tangible results, etc.) But there&#x27;s a subtle aspect to the apprenticeship system which also helps teens transition to adulthood, and that&#x27;s the interaction of adults and &quot;children&quot; on a peer level.<p>At the moment you have an almost pathological system, anyone that a teenager interacts with who is over 18 is basically in a different world. And most of the time those people are authority figures. For the most part teens look to their peers for cues on how to behave, with predictable results. With an apprenticeship model you don&#x27;t have that same arbitrary age-based segregation; apprentices, workers, and &quot;masters&quot; all work together, spend time together, and so on. They often become friendly, and often the younger apprentices would pick up cues on how to behave from those who are older and more mature, because in that context they are their peers.<p>This is hugely important because it jump-starts the process of gaining responsibility and maturity for teens as they transition to adulthood, and provides an extended network of people beyond just one&#x27;s immediate family who can be consulted for advice on various questions that tend to present themselves when one is growing up.<p>When I was a teen I was considerably more mature than the average of folks around me and for the longest time I didn&#x27;t realize exactly why. I&#x27;m sure some of that is just my own personality, but recently I figured out that part of it had to do with the fact that I ended up spending a lot more time interacting with and working with adults than is normal for most teens and children. To me, it didn&#x27;t feel weird to be hanging out with adults or working alongside adults as a peer when I was 10 or 14 or what-have-you, and that made the transition to adulthood fairly non-eventful. Sure, I struggled with plenty of the normal problems that everyone faces in their 20s (what to do with your life, how to build a career, etc.). But I didn&#x27;t struggle with the same issues a lot of newly minted 18 year olds struggle with for years, such as how to be a responsible person, how to do work or learn of your own volition instead of being forced into it, and so on.<p>Unfortunately, that sort of thing is if anything almost actively discouraged today due to an excessive fear of child predators. And while we&#x27;ve perhaps incrementally affected the prevalence of sexual abuse of minors, if we even have, we&#x27;ve definitely stunted the development and maturation of millions upon millions of people over several generations, which unimaginably enormous negative consequences.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is to these problems but I do know that the current system is broken to an almost pathological extent, it should be one of our highest priorities to fix it.",1419167972

The latter has a variant: Zubrin proposed that we can make rocket fuel on Mars and use that for the ascent and/or return.<p>Of these, I don&#x27;t see why a flyby does anything other than say we did it. Our automated probes are now much more capable than we had in the 1960s/1970s. Though if a human were useful, the Venus is definitely quicker to get to than Mars.<p>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s about the same amount of delta-v to get to Mars as Venus, so orbiting either is possible, except the longer flight time for Mars and back means a lot more extra supplies (something like 5kg/day * 14 months?) and more risk of something going wrong. Venus comes out ahead.<p>But what does a human orbiting either planet add that a robotic probe does not?<p>The most often given example is fast response time for a rover, since it&#x27;s at least a 4 minute lag for Venus and 6 minutes for Mars. I would rather have a dozen slow rovers on the ground controlled from Earth, or a dozen long-term probes orbiting the gas giants than a single one by a human above Venus. In any case, we know we can put capable rovers on Mars. On Venus they tend to melt.<p>This one to descend into the atmosphere of Venus means a return vehicle almost as powerful as what&#x27;s needed to get someone off Earth. That&#x27;s going to be tough to solve. Our biggest balloon launched rockets are, I believe, from amateur organizations. OTOH, robots don&#x27;t need to come back to Earth.<p>Landing on a moon of Mars would combine Mars observations and visual exploration of (what&#x27;s believed to be) an asteroid. Though it would be easier if we go to a near Earth asteroid instead.<p>In the balance of things, I think Mars is still more enticing. Though I&#x27;m definitely in the robot probe camp.<p>And I would much rather have people on the Moon again, since my hopeful belief is that trained geologists on the ground for a full lunar day would be more capable than the equivalent cost in robots at understanding lunar geology.

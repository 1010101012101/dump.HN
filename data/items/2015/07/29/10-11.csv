9967732,comment,9927771,9929388,0,0,lpsmith,,,"There is a good chance that your proposed algorithm to enforce a uniqueness constraint in the application won&#x27;t work.    As in,  you&#x27;ve left out enough details that would be critical for getting it right,  and in my experience,  a lot of programmers would only get this right by accident if they get it right at all.<p>First problem is that the SQL standard provides no way to make this work portably on any standards-compliant database.   So right there you are going to have to code to the database to one degree or another.<p>So,  let&#x27;s say you want to make this work in Postgres.  Now,  you&#x27;ll need to be using Postgres 9.0 at least;  otherwise your uniqueness constraint won&#x27;t be a uniqueness constraint.<p>Try this,  in any version of Postgres.   Open up two psql sessions.  In one,  run a `create table unique (x text);`.  Then run `begin isolation level repeatable read;  select * from unique where x = &#x27;foo&#x27;;` in one of the sessions.   Repeat those two commands in the other sessions.<p>Neither session sees &#x27;foo&#x27;.   So now both can go ahead and run `insert into unique values (&#x27;foo&#x27;); commit;`.   Both transactions will succeed,  and you can confirm that there are now two instances of &#x27;foo&#x27; in the table.<p>In fact,  `begin isolation level serializable` in PostgreSQL 9.0 or later is the minimum isolation level to make this work.   And, you will need retry logic around the transaction in case of a serialization failure.  (Perhaps your DB access layer or language would hide this latter detail from you,  or perhaps not.)<p>In PostgreSQL 8.4 and before,  serializable and repeatable read were equivalent,  and both were still SQL standards compliant.   In PostgreSQL 9.0,  the repeatable read isolation level stayed the same,  while the serializable isolation level was strengthened.<p>Unless you can accept a certain level of degraded accuracy by using a probabilistic construct such as a Bloom filter,  by far the biggest cost of maintaining uniqueness is the index.   And you&#x27;ll need that index whether you use the database or the application to enforce uniqueness.<p>And, judiciously pushing computation onto a database can actually be cheaper for the database as well as its clients.   This scenario is likely to be one of those situations.",1438167431

Your steps should be in a cycle: short, long, long. Long in this case means a double step. Thus, you will cover five stairs in one short-long-long cycle. In addition, you should always start the first cycle on the same foot. Suppose you start on the left foot, then after two cycles you are back on the left foot, having covered ten stairs. While you are walking the stairs in this way, it is clear where you are in the cycle. By the end of the staircase, you will know the number of stairs modulo ten. Usually there are not a lot of stairs in a staircase, so you can easily estimate the total if you know the last digit of that number.",1438167392

I don&#x27;t have much experience with the USPTO themselves, but knowing people working in european patent offices:<p>1. they are judged pretty much solely on the number of patents examined and their responsiveness<p>2. patent offices are funded through maintenance fees (fees paid to renew the patents and keep them enforceable) creating a fucked up incentive to accept patents by default at the cost of the already very loose and subjective patentability criteria (&quot;novelty&quot; and &quot;inventive step or non-obviousness&quot;)<p>3. especially given patent offices are generally underfunded and short-staffed, especially in high-flying specialists able to actually evaluate patents which are either complex or in novel fields (being a patent examiner is few people&#x27;s idea of a great career, even less so once you&#x27;ve built experience and respectability in your field, and that&#x27;s assuming the patent office could even hire and pay you), even more so compared to the high-powered business they face<p>4. this is compounded by states routinely &quot;diverting&quot; (plundering) patent offices&#x27;s funding, in the US Congress diverts about 10% of the USPTO&#x27;s collected fees to the general treasury<p>5. it is also compounded by the opening of whole new and novel patent fields (&quot;business method&quot; patents) which generate even faster growth than the historical patent fields and are the source of much of the bullshit patents<p>that&#x27;s not even considering that the existing patent system simply isn&#x27;t a good fit for software, more generally the whole field of business method patents seems incredibly fucked up and created specifically to be abused (good thing europe has declined to implement it)<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlog_of_unexamined_patent_applications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlog_of_unexamined_patent_a...</a>",1438166610

Ad-blockers are run by a <i>minority</i> of users, and the vast majority simply use whatever browser camne with their PC, or maybe download Chrome. But installing ad-blockers, GreaseMonkey scripts, Firefox extensions and the like basically <i>never</i> crosses the mind of your average web content viewing public. [1]<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d count the adverts I see as &#x27;abusive&#x27; either. Many times I have found ads useful, interesting, curious or (on YouTube videos) worth watching without skipping. Just as with TV and newspapers, yes, there is much crass, unsubtle, and badly created advertising. However, it&#x27;s all ignorable, and even if a site pops up an inter-stitial advert, I&#x27;ve yet to come across one that I cannot close and move on to the content. Of course, pop-ups that tell me I have read all the free content I am allowed are different, and in those cases I make a choice - do I want to read the article enough to pay for it?<p>As for wanting GBP 10 per month, I would spend much more than that on physical newspapers (at 50p per issue, the &#x27;i&#x27; is one of the cheapest, so that&#x27;s about GBP 15 per month) so it seems pretty reasonable. And I don&#x27;t expect my copy of the Guardian to have no adverts because I paid for it, as opposed to reading it in the library. In fact, again, I find the adverts can often be useful and informative, even in such a widely targeted medium as a single newspaper.<p>[1] full disclosure - I have never used or installed an ad-blocker, nor wanted to in my 20+ years of web usage",1438165521

9967535,comment,9966118,9966365,0,0,Perseids,,,">  1. This isn&#x27;t censorship of the type that is illegal or not allowed. It is a private company deciding a word was inappropriate.<p>It is a private company, alright, but it is also becoming a critical company for the internet as a whole. Which points to an important question our society will have to face more and more often with increasing centralization and globalization: When does a company become essential infrastructure and be judged (morally, by law, by the executive) different to any other private entity.<p>During the financial crisis we have seen that large parts of the banking sector were deemed &quot;to big to fail&quot; and kept on life support by the government. Facebook has grown large enough than any changes in their TOS and privacy policy are closely watched and often criticized by a multitude of public parties and the press (at least in Germany).<p>I&#x27;ve only recently realized how far we have come in terms of better development standards when I tried find the official repository for ncurses (which is a GNU project, by the way). There is none. The current development code is hosted via ftp as a set of tarball snapshots [1]. As far as I can tell, no development history beside the change notes of each snapshot before May 2015 is publicly accessible. Issue tracking seems to be handled over the mailing list [2]. And I asked myself, why can&#x27;t this project be hosted on GitHub?<p>The answer depends on how reliable GitHub turns out - or continues - to be. If we can&#x27;t hold GitHub to a higher standard than just &quot;they are a private company, they may do whatever they want&quot;, then ncurses should host its own issue tracker and git repository. But if we judge GitHub as an infrastructure, then sure, host this core GNU project via a private company.<p>> 2. It seems like most in this comment thread agree that this action, as a singular act, is a good thing. The word was offensive. Github asked the repo to change it. They did. The end.<p>Note that how to deal with swear words or offensive words in general is very culture specific. In the society I live in I seldom encounter cussing or &quot;inappropriate behaviour&quot;, but when I do, they are next to never beeped over or blurred out. Rather, when in bad faith, they serve to disqualify the speaker. (And when they are used in good faith they benefit artistic freedom.)<p>This is not to say &quot;our&quot; way of dealing with questionable or offensive behaviour is the &quot;right&quot; one. Rather, if we hold GitHub to <i>internet infrastructure standards</i>, then they have to find some middle ground between corporate America puritanism and the diverse culture that surrounds it. It&#x27;s not an easy task, see for example Facebook&#x27;s debate on nudity vs. breast feeding, but otherwise every entry on GitHub will be as boring as Oracle documentation - no more &quot;Hurr durr I&#x27;ma sheep&quot; releases for you.<p>[1] ftp://invisible-island.net/ncurses/current/\n[2] The issue at question being that no ncurses release compiles with the current GCC: <a href=""https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-ncurses/2015-06/msg00024.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-ncurses/2015-06/msg00...</a>",1438164507

This doesn&#x27;t just reduces the likelihood of a security issue but also reduces the impact of such issues for example SQL injection on a shared hosting will yield pretty much nothing, yes they&#x27;ll be able to dump the application tables but that&#x27;s it, forget about code/command execution that DB is locked down harder than one would think it&#x27;s possible same thing go for other issues, local file inclusion? well GL, directory traversal, breaking out of the chroot, try agin...<p>Now this ofc doesn&#x27;t mean that some one can&#x27;t configure their own box to be just as secure for but for all effective purposes if you are running a small operation like a personal site or a site for you own small business the chances of you being able to effectively managing security at the same level of a solid hosting provider is quite slim.",1438164283

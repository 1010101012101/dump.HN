You do get an idea when you start at her bibliography; not many scientists have their papers subdivided into epochs [1].<p>To begin with, Einstein didn't describe Emmy Noether (in his obituary of her, sent to the New York Times) as ""the most 'significant and 'creative' female mathematician of all time"". The exact quote is instead: ""In the judgment of the most competent living mathematicians, Frulein Noether was the most significant creative mathematical genius thus far produced since the higher education of women began."" [2]<p>In essence, he is describing her as the greatest mathematician of the past decades, male or female. That may have been a slight exaggeration (she was a friend of his and visited frequently at Princeton during her time at Bryn Mawr), but not much: she was definitely one of the most influential mathematicians of the 1920s and early 1930s. Many mathematicians and physicists visited Gttingen specifically to interact with her.<p>What made her so important were not just her contributions to abstract algebra (groundbreaking as they were, essentially redefining the field), but probably most of all her axiomatic ""method of abstraction"", pioneered in several papers starting with 1921's ""Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen"". For non-mathematicians, it is roughly the same concept as abstract data types; instead of proving theorems about very specific mathematical constructs (such as integers and polynomials), you prove them for more general constructs, abstractly defined through operations over them and axioms connecting those operations. It is one of those things that seem blindingly obvious in retrospect, but the approach was actually hotly debated in the 1920s; these days, it's foundational for much of mathematics.<p>A good example of this is the so-called Lasker-Noether theorem, which was initially proven by Emanuel Lasker for a couple of specific rings, a result that Emmy Noether later generalized for a wide class of rings (rings that we now call, for other reasons, Noetherian rings).<p>Another reason why she is little known these days even among mathematicians is probably that she didn't care much about getting credit for her ideas (even though she was painstakingly careful about giving others credit in her own papers). Her own publications, numerous as they were [1], are probably only the tip of the iceberg; it is known, for example, that volume 2 of van der Waerden's ""Modern Algebra"" (the standard textbook for abstract algebra for decades) was essentially her work (van der Waerden never made a secret of it). A lot of her other work was likewise published under the name of her students and colleagues. (Unlike what the article states, she never published under a man's name.)<p>This is the final way in which she influenced mathematics -- as a teacher. She never was a very good teacher when it came to actual lecturing (being too much of an absent-minded professor), but she was generous with sharing her ideas and an inspiring influence for her students on colleagues (her first Ph.D. student, Grete Hermann, went on to lay the foundations for Computer Algebra, for example).<p>As van der Waerden wrote, ""Each of her lecture series was a paper. And nobody was happier than herself when such a paper was completed by her students. Completely unegotistical and free of vanity, she never claimed anything for herself, but promoted the works of her students above all.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether_bibliography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether_bibliography</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Obits2/Noether_Emmy_Einstein.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Obits2/Noether_Emmy_...</a>",1332853196

The rest of the business is about figuring out how to lower shipping costs so that we make more money per item shipped. Or how to deliver food more efficiently. Or accounts receivable software.<p>And none of those problems are, well, are particularly hard or complex, at least not enough in my mind to justify ego as you've portrayed it.<p>There are plenty of professions where people work just as hard (harder, even, including people in the knowledge-working industry) and do not complain nearly as much as developers.<p>There is a lawyer in our office who works very hard to ensure that we are selling wine in a compliant way across multiple states with different regulations. That person's job is at least as difficult, if not more, than my job writing python.

3761210,comment,3758047,3760423,1,0,kls,,,"I think the actual feasibility of man made annihilation is  smaller than what it is made out to be by the media and entertainment industry. The two most popular ways that are highlighted are nuclear war or bio-engineered pathogen. As far as the first one goes, nuclear war will only eliminate the population centers and irradiate everything, there would be survivors and they would adapt to the conditions.<p>The second, a pathogen, is just as unlikely to get every last one of us. A virus with a 100% kill rate is highly unlikely. Look at Ebola, while weaponized Ebola would get a great deal of us it's kill rate is somewhere in the 90%'tile, I don't know the exact number but I know it is high and I believe that it is the highest. 10% of the earth population is still allot of people. Even if it is less than that, somewhere their will be a group of people that for whatever reason are resistant to the pathogen.<p>The only thing that I think is a real threat to our existence today, is a big piece of something floating around out there, deciding to slam into us down here. I don't think we have the capability to do it to ourselves. I heard someone say that it is likely that we will keep resetting ourselves back to the stone-age at a certain mark in technological progress, which I think is a little more feasible, but I personally believe that mans desire to cull different people is self regulation for whatever reason.",1332853146

For instance, Sphinx to write documentation is free, but you need to have at least a desire to write in markup to create it, and I'm assuming that single-sourcing multiple user manuals with conditional text and variables is not exactly trivial. Plus, sharing the writing of such a user manual between more than one person requires the use of a third-party solution, a version control system, which also requires some training & expertise to use properly.<p>Where as, on the other hand, if you can convince your boss to dish out $200 a month <i>per user</i> for something like Author-It, you get an extremely powerful system that does everything an authoring tool is supposed to.

From their perspective, Java's popularity is a vindication of its value. So many languages and methodologies have been oversold for decades and managers don't know which of these are real (e.g. functional programming, which provides a long-term 2-4x improvement in programmer productivity) and which are bullshit hawked by overpriced consultants.<p>What I've learned is that it's better to use the best tools anyway, deliver software using them, and use existing accomplishments to make your case. Results talk. It's better to ask forgiveness than permission. If you deliver something awesome that helps the company, people are going to overlook what language you used.",1332850829

Companies such a Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook run on C++. In addition, it has vendor support on all the major operating systems. In contrast, not even Mozilla, has bet the company on Rust (Servo is experimental and Mozilla has made no promises of actually integrating it into Firefox.) Also, Rust is not vendor supported on any platform.<p>So if you are a CTO or someone who has the responsibility of deciding what language to use for your performance critical software, you already have a large bias toward C++. You may be swayed toward Rust by the fact that Rust is memory safe. However, when someone comes and tells you that with this open source tool for C++ backed by the big names in C++, and developed and supported by Microsoft, and just by using the GSL types you can get most of the benefit of Rust, you will decide that the delta of improvement of Rust over C++ is not worth it.<p>TLDR: In programming language use pragmatic considerations trump purity. Multibillion dollar companies run on C++. With GSL and static analysis, C++ is &quot;good enough&quot;.",1446386182

Capitalism is really about the pre-eminence of capital (it&#x27;s right there in the name).<p>Capital is what distinguishes capitalism from other, similar economic forms. Choice is what undergirds capitalism and all these other types of economy.<p>Also, capital == choices. Not having choices == not having capital.<p>> That&#x27;s how we get QE, austerity, TTIP, bank bailouts, extra strong patents and a bunch of other gifts from government to billionaires.<p>What makes capitalism successful is that it is pursued by people. You seem to believe that abstract legal principles, such that might keep things like QE and austerity from happening, are stronger than people&#x27;s desires to route around those principles. They&#x27;re not. Despite this, our system manages to evolve anyway.<p>Also, if you think corporate socialism in the US is bad, you should check out Russia.<p>> Uber drivers&#x27; lack of success at it says no more about the merits of unionization than the failure of 95% of entrepreneurs does about entrepreneurship.<p>Why are you saying, &quot;lack of success&quot; at unionizing?

What can they do?<p>Uber drivers have access to the entire city they serve and are capable of moving around this city at will. They could find a better job.<p>> The major failure any economic model designed to &quot;prove&quot; that we&#x27;re living in a fair society demonstrates is an underlying assumption that is completely, utterly and stupidly wrong.<p>You&#x27;re going to have to rephrase this because I have no idea what you&#x27;re trying to say.<p>> Try living on a minimum wage for three months and then start lecturing us about how easy it is. With dependents.<p>Try doing it in the outskirts of a Colombian city with no minimum wage. Have you seen how those people live? Homelessness in America is a cakewalk. Food is everywhere. Government services abound. It&#x27;s hard compared to being middle class or even working class, but relatively speaking compared to everywhere else in the world that it&#x27;s possible to be poor in, it&#x27;s easy.<p>> You know that your ideas are half witted when they demand that you believe that people choose to be poorer.<p>It sounds like you believe poor people can make no meaningful choices at all.

If you ever tried to profile a locking performance issue with a statistical profiler triggered by CPU time, you&#x27;ve met this problem. If you measure time/work unit for each work unit (and the input generation process has some form of back off/balking mechanism built-in) a naive report will give more weight to regions of time when work units complete quickly.<p>For example, if I have a system that alternates between 100 requests/second for 1 second and 5 request/second for 1 second, reporting distribution per request would yield numbers like:<p>Average latency: 2000 ms / 105 ~ 19 ms;<p>90th percentile: 10 ms.<p>These metrics aren&#x27;t wrong… but they&#x27;re not very useful if you&#x27;re interested in latency rather than throughput. From a latency standpoint, I&#x27;d rather know the distribution of latency based on something like: if I choose to kick off a request at a random point in the next minute/hour, what latency can I expect on average? what&#x27;s the 90th percentile <i>in terms of random request time</i>? I&#x27;d find something like:<p>Average latency: .5 * 10 ms + .5 * 200 ms = 105 ms;<p>90th percentile: 200 ms.<p>The difference with percentiles is key, in my view. With event-based sampling, you can significantly improve percentiles by focusing on the cases that are already good (and that&#x27;s exactly what we try to avoid with percentiles): a system with 200 rps for 1 sec, then 5 rps for 1 sec now has a 90th percentile latency of... 1000 / 200 = 5 ms! Even worse, we can also improve the 99th percentile simply by processing fewer events in the slow region.<p>In the extreme case, the system is so completely useless during its &quot;slow&quot; phase that it processes 0 events… and the information we gather now represents only the fast phase, even when the system is in slow mode 99% of the time.<p>TL;DR: Pay attention to the X axis in distribution data! Is it actually what you want to sample from to characterise your system?",1446386034

Ex-Cell-O Corporation.<p>The variations Arganov proposed in his counter-offer were pretty extreme: he made significant changes to the material terms. He also didn&#x27;t appear to do anything to bring Tinkov&#x27;s attention to these variations and made the counter-offer look very similar to the initial offer (i.e: it looked almost identical). I don&#x27;t see any mention that he highlighted the variations, or included a note bringing Tinkov&#x27;s attention to them, or asked Tinkov to initial beside them. At this point, I would say that Tinkov didn&#x27;t consent to the variation and had assumed that Arganov had accepted their original offer.<p>BUT, since they apparently gave him the unlimited line of credit he had included in his counter-offer, it seems pretty conclusive that by their conduct they had in fact accepted Arganov&#x27;s counter-offer.<p>[<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Machine_Tool_Co_Ltd_v_Ex-Cell-O_Corp_(England)_Ltd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Machine_Tool_Co_Ltd_v_E...</a>]",1446385794

However, as a user, I would certainly want the following to be considered:<p>* Install base. Judging by this [1] and some very rough back-of-the-envelope calculations, 10.6 has ~7% of the OSX share, and 10.9 has ~13%. To exclude at least 20% of your market seems unreasonable, to me. It certainly seems unwise if you&#x27;re in the business of selling a product. Although that&#x27;s obviously not the whole story; that 20% almost certainly represents less-than-average potential value.<p>* Nature of the product. Of course, an app that absolutely must use a feature of El Capitan will have to set the requirement there. What on earth is there about a file finder that requires Yosemite, though? This is where your expertise as an app developer can add some value to my opinion: can you guess what APIs we&#x27;re talking about here, and isn&#x27;t it possible to program in a backwards-compatible way to avoid them if they&#x27;re not available? In fact, if we were talking about the web, it would be bordering on unforgivable to fix on a specific release of a specific browser because it supports a specific feature. The Right Way (TM) to do it would be to feature-sniff and act accordingly, not reject use of the application altogether. Isn&#x27;t that possible in the world of OSX development?<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0&qpsp=201&qpnp=2&qptimeframe=M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share...</a>",1446384046

I think the intellectual mistake the author made is in thinking that one&#x27;s political dogma (and therefore party affiliation) should not change over time because the party does not change over time. That is, the idea that a political party is the manifestation of an unchanging view.<p>The fun revelation is that business dresses itself up as conservative, then pursues its own ends of profit. That&#x27;s the entire definition of bourgeois. It is worth highlighting as in many ways, the free software movement is a very conservative one, from the point of view of the way code was shared in the beginning of its history: That is, you asked the programmer who wrote the code you were interested in for a copy and usually got it gratis as the money was made in selling the equipment. The change of label to liberal-radical came later when business started to realize that software, itself, was a sell-able product.<p>The point I&#x27;m making is that choosing a side in any two party system is always artificial. Any party affiliation should be viewed as one of convenience. This explains why Bernie Sanders caucuses with the Democratic Party and why both Paul politicians aligned with the GOP.<p>From my standpoint, the only winning play for the individual is to decide what is important to yourself, acknowledge that it will change over time,  and remember not to get caught up in the game being played. Your &quot;side&quot;, or party affiliation, in fact, should change as your interests change.<p>In other words, don&#x27;t be proud of your party, and don&#x27;t overly-identify with said party.",1446383557

The (too quick of a) tentative jump from well automated targeted tasks to generic task automation is the culprit here.<p>In my few years of practice of deep neural networks in industry, I can say they are very nice to work with as they fit a large number of tasks and yield excellent results for many of them.",1446383484

The model is know as Flexicurity[1].<p>The problem is that that model keeps a lot of people outside the working market because their skills simply aren&#x27;t worth the salaries they would have to get because of this model.

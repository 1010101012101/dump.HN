365324,comment,365293,365293,0,0,robg,,,"The advice I've gotten: Write a book proposal. In it, lay out chapters with one or two paragraph summaries. The process forces you to think a lot about organization. It also provides a blueprint/outline for you going forward. You'll see how the ideas fit together to recognize missing gaps in your thesis. Keep in mind that it's an evolving document and as you write more you'll be better able to incorporate new material and scrap old forks. Starting with the summary provides clear signposts along the way.<p>Good luck!<p>Edit: Of course, I forgot the reason why many folks also write a proposal: To shop it around, get an agent, and an advance. Problem is, that usually requires some connections in the industry, special expertise, compelling story, and/or all of the above. You don't need to shop it around to get the benefits, though it's nice to have if you happen to run into someone who could help.",1226758827

365322,comment,364747,365299,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I'd venture that it refers to bad decisions that lead to low quality of code, the problems of which are inherited by all code built on it. And so on. With every layer you pay for your past mistakes, and you quickly spend more time working around the problems than you would have spent fixing them in the first place. (or fixing the stuff below before layering even more code on)<p>For example, the amount of hoops I had to jump through to be <i>allowed</i> to fix some old code at my last job was astounding, even though the bugs had literally caused man-years of lost work, and eventually took me about 2 weeks to sort out.",1226758745
365321,comment,365293,365293,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I always like to start with a mindmap (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map</a>) of the key points. Once I have those, I flesh out the individual nodes underneath. I then organize into Chapters/sections and start writing.<p>I've read where some people create a PowerPoint presentation and work backwards from that as well. The key thing for me is that I don't want to get tied down to Chapter 1, Chapter 2, etc too early - I want the flexibility to move things around without hindering my thinking process. That's the sort of thing that is perfect for mind mapping tools like FreeMind (<a href=""http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a>).",1226758582

And then, there are only 1-3 winners at any contest. For every person that adds to the competition, his/her probability of winning reduces the moment they pay $40... will this encourage people to participate in any manner?",1226758400

I've been using TextEdit on the mac a lot lately for my writing, but anything's good.<p>If you're writing for a publisher, then they're going to give you a template that's probably for Word, and you don't have to worry about complicated document struturing stuff -- they'll help with the referencing, etc.<p>If you're doing it all yourself, then a document description system such as LaTeX might be the way to go.  If I was writing a technical book that i knew had little chance of being published, I'd probably use that.",1226758272

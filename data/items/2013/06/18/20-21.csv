5902022,comment,5893442,5901721,3,0,chrisdone,,,"I dunno about Yhc. Jhc, at least, is slower than GHC. It depends on the settings and the project in my experience.<p>If you&#x27;re on a project like a Yesod app, then you have to conservatively rebuild a lot more than you would normally because TH doesn&#x27;t lend itself well to incremental compilation and the compiling itself is slower too. Depending on the size of the project you&#x27;re facing 5-15-30 seconds of waiting. That is actually monstrous and I hate it as much as you do, I cannot stand waiting for my app to rebuild, I turn to reddit, or YouTube. The more time waiting for feedback the less interactive and less enjoyable a programming experience is for me. So I think we&#x27;re on the same page on that.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re just using normal Haskell code with reasonably modularized file structure, GHC will be able to rebuild incrementally and link just that module quickly. E.g. if it&#x27;s a web app, you can have MyProject.View.Person and just change something in a blaze-html template and hit F12 in your editor (as I do) and it&#x27;ll rebuild and restart in a second. I mean, to rebuild hpaste entirely from scratch takes 5 seconds:<p><pre><code>    $ time cabal build --ghc-options=&#x27;-fforce-recomp -O0&#x27;\n    Compiling [snip]\n    Linking dist/build/hpaste/hpaste ...\n\n    real 0m5.116s\n    user 0m3.936s\n    sys 0m0.680s\n</code></pre>\nWhich is great. hpaste is only 4kloc, but your average codebase is between 3 and 15. In a normal development cycle you&#x27;re changing just one or two modules at once, so with incremental compilation the refresh cycle is very fast. If you just want to type-check there is the -fno-code flag which brings it down to 1.2s to typecheck the whole project.<p>Another approach I&#x27;ve taken with an IRC server (hulk) is running it inside GHCi. That works surprisingly well. Especially if you have your run function return the state as a mutable reference, then you can take a look at it while it&#x27;s running and update it. Here&#x27;s hpaste running in GHCi:<p><pre><code>    λ> :set args &quot;hpaste.conf&quot;\n    λ> tid <- forkIO main\n    Listening on http://0.0.0.0:1234/\n    PASS ******\n    USER hpaste * * *\n    NICK hpaste\n    λ> :t tid\n    tid :: ThreadId\n    λ> killThread tid\n    Shutting down...\n    λ> tid <- forkIO main\n    Listening on http://0.0.0.0:1234/\n    PASS ******\n    USER hpaste * * *\n    NICK hpaste\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s currently running on <a href=""http://chrisdone.com:1234/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrisdone.com:1234/</a> (I&#x27;ll take it down later). Doesn&#x27;t seem slow! Updating the code takes some milliseconds with :r and restarting is a case of killThread tid and fork again, some other milliseconds.<p>So yeah, I feel you on dev time. I&#x27;m more inclined to the approaches that lead to more immediate development cycles, can&#x27;t stand waiting. I&#x27;m Emacser/ex Common Lisper. GHC could be faster, but there are definitely circumstances which exacerbate its performance, I reckon, and ways to combat it (as above).<p>I know that&#x27;s not a very good answer, more of a workaround than a reason. I don&#x27;t know why GHC is particularly slow if it&#x27;s a lot slower than Yhc was. Other than all its separate build steps, I get the impression from what people say that it&#x27;s just mounted up and become quite hairy. And memory usage has never been much of a concern for the compiler. That&#x27;s a pity and I&#x27;m all for work being done on improving its performance.",1371589081

5902010,comment,5897458,5898980,2,0,cheald,,,"Sorry, I wasn&#x27;t trying to springboard. I was saying (poorly) that games like God of War, even with their difficulty slider cranked, aren&#x27;t &quot;hard&quot; in the way that older games were. The difficulty slider is basically just an HP-and-damage dial; the fundamentals that make modern games &quot;easy&quot; are still there. My point is that in many modern games, the cost of failure is minimal.<p>Games that are unfair just to be frustrating are just horribly designed, no doubt. But, modern games are frequently guilty of reducing the cost of failure in order to keep from frustrating players, sometimes at the cost of one of the biggest rushes in gaming - overcoming something that is genuinely hard-but-surmountable, which requires awareness and timing and cunning and careful use of resources.<p>I like easy games; I really enjoy the experience of traipsing through a story without too much impediment. But I also really enjoy the experience of getting my butt handed to me over and over because I got impatient or sloppy, and the feeling of accomplishment when I overcome that. Dark Souls is among the best modern examples of that sort of game - it&#x27;s brutally uncompromising, but you&#x27;re given all the tools you need. The combat design is extremely precise, but in return it asks for a lot of precision from the player, and it harshly punishes failure; in this way, it&#x27;s very reminiscent of older games, rather than belonging to the new breed of games where falling off a ledge respawns you on that ledge, or fighting a boss has four different phases, with a checkpoint at each phase.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating for the game being a jerk to the player just to frustrate them. That&#x27;s never fun. All I&#x27;m saying is that the difficulty difference between old games and new games is in how they punish failure, rather than where the HP and damage sliders are set.",1371588945

This must result in minimization of efficient internal communications mechanisms (an increase in cognitive &quot;secrecy tax&quot;) and consequent system-wide cognitive decline resulting in decreased ability to hold onto power as the environment demands adaption.</i><p><i>Hence in a world where leaking is easy, secretive or unjust systems are nonlinearly hit relative to open, just systems. Since unjust systems, by their nature induce opponents, and in many places barely have the upper hand, mass leaking leaves them exquisitely vulnerable to those who seek to replace them with more open forms of governance.</i><p>In other words, in an increasingly digital world, its gets easier and easier for large scale leaks to happen, and although you can take measures to try and stop that, overall those measures will damage your effectiveness even more. Some leaks are &#x27;good&#x27; and some are &#x27;bad&#x27;, but over time, in a leaky world, the overall long term effect should be positive - a move towards more openness.<p>* its pretty obvious who, but I don&#x27;t want to derail.",1371588004

To me, the ability to act is the only thing that exists, and &quot;rights&quot; are just people in a community agreeing to use collective force to enforce whatever they decide to call &quot;rights.&quot; The idea that the community as a whole can be bound to limit its ability to act with respect to people outside that compact is to me not a sensible thing.<p>And I think that while most Americans wouldn&#x27;t phrase it precisely in that way, their thinking is along similar lines. We&#x27;re a country that strenuously reserves the right to do whatever the hell we want, bound only by our own collective conscience. We want to do right by people, but we get to be the final arbiters of what&#x27;s right and what is justified.",1371585708

As mentioned, OpenVZ and Linux VServer existed in the 90&#x27;s, but they never made it into the mainline.  So really this is the second try for Linux.<p>Basically I think it is a consequence of containers/sandboxing being a very &quot;commercial&quot; technology, even though they are open source.  The main users are hosting providers, and there&#x27;s a significant amount of money in that business.<p>In the 90&#x27;s there was a hosting &quot;land rush&quot; with all of these companies like 1and1 and dreamhost selling shared hosting on Linux.  They were the ones that developed Linux VServer and OpenVZ apparently, and I think the pace was too great to get it into the mainline.  Interested in any first-hand knowledge people have.<p>And in the 2010&#x27;s there is a PaaS &quot;land rush&quot;, with all of these companies building on AWS and other IaaS, while needing containerization like LXC.  The OP&#x27;s article is calling for increased support in distros -- I think the same lack of time for cooperation is happening.  Heroku, Cloud Foundry, dot Cloud, ActiveState, etc. are all using the same thing essentially, but there&#x27;s a big land grab, so they are all maintaining proprietary and complex user space configuration.<p>The kernel features like the various namespaces are just about finished trickling in I think; that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re secure though.",1371585647

Just as I'm working writing a book, I've started to see a number of opinions related to the issue: Newspapers are dead! E-books are great! But people will still want a paperback for that long flight! Media cartels are evil! Except the ones that protect authors who barely make enough to get by! Until they prevent Amazon from having a computer read your books to you! AArrrggghhhh!<p>Ok, so here's the question: How should I go about approaching the publishing question? It's still early to be asking this question (manuscript is still easily a month away from the editor, let alone the publisher), but I need a distraction from writing...<p>Anyway, here's how I see my choices:<p>- I could go the traditional route of editor, agent, publisher... profit! The problem is, I went down that road once. A year later, the agent never got me anywhere, and I stopped caring (the book honestly wasn't that great, so that might have something to do with it).<p>- I'm still finishing graduate school, and I could approach my university's press about publishing. The book is rather technical in nature. My biggest concern here is that I highly doubt they would care as much as a larger publishing house about things like advertising or promotion. I'm also worried they might attempt to retain copyright.<p>- I might try this new-fangled inter-whatsit distribution scheme. I've seen a few sites I actually rather like (Lulu looks rather nice). My concern here is that I really don't know that I would have the time to handle self-promotion. I'm not looking to become rich from my writing, but I would like to make something. That said, I do have another job.<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!",1237795171

As for TV, it's consistently as annoying as it has always been. (except for the in-show layering on the bottom of the screen) There was a Family Guy episode that made fun of that.

528202,comment,527972,527972,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"Aaron describes the problem of governments being controlled by special interests (in this case, a group of local businessmen). That is indeed a serious problem - a problem with how politics works at the moment. I'd like to see some proposed solutions. Libertarians would suggest that reducing the scope and power of the government would help, because a shadowy cabal won't be interested in capturing government power if there's little power to capture. But that seems to be a uniquely libertarian point of view. Recently, Aaron proposed that activists become politicians and attempt to win elections. Is that a practical, sustainable, and/or complete solution?",1237793707

528200,comment,527706,528188,0,0,derefr,,,"You missed the symmetry of the equality. If you have ""better culling algorithms"", each branch gets culled away faster, so, on an EEG or a similar device, you appear to be thinking faster.<p>The reason I didn't mention the possible variation in working memory capacity was a single word that I left out, leaving it, like I said, to the Computer Scientist: ""exponential."" Every time your have an additional binary choice to make, your possible solution-space doubles. It doesn't matter how large your working memory is; as long as it's a fixed, finite size, an exponential growth in memory consumption will consume it with relative ease. The culling algorithm needs to be of a certain minimum efficiency to keep you from ""blowing your stack"" and losing your place repeatedly, and this is what is perceived as ""speed.""<p>I think you misinterpreted, though, that I meant that intelligence is the speed <i>at which you solve macro-level problems</i>. It certainly isn't. Intelligence is the speed at which you prune decisions; external to the mind, this affects the <i>confidence</i> you can take in your assertions, not the speed at which you reach them.<p>The more confident you are in lemma 1, the more quickly you can <i>consciously decide to</i> move onto lemma 2, and so on, but this requires some internal message passing that's much slower than the complete decision-branch path-finding ""system call"" in your mind. Your macro ""problem-solving speed"" is much more affected by the speed of the IRQ handler (the neocortex, I think), but if the system calls keep returning a low confidence interval, you have to keep consciously pulling apart intuitions into graphs of semantic knowledge, and passing each node to the path-finder in turn, until you feel sure enough of your decision to become aware of it. If your culling algorithm is more efficient (as directly measured by your score, not your time, on an IQ test) then you will become aware of things that others never will, because their minds are caught in loops that return false-negative confidences.<p>Sleep, then, gives your culling algorithm a larger fixed-bound on its runtime before it must return a confidence; this is why sleeping on something will let you make decisions that you felt involved too much complexity the day before. (Of course, sleeping does other things as well, like transferring things between short- and long- term memory (where they're stored--if they are stored--with a much lower path cost), and shutting off the neocortex so the mind doesn't constantly have to context-switch to ring 3 while it's trying to process things.)",1237793552

I fell victim to one accidentally: I was trying to happily accept a job but the acceptance deadline detailed on my offer actually expired the day after I received it in the mail. At the time I thought it odd that the company was in such a rush to get a response from me that they couldn't give me a week or so to think about it. Then I got there and found out very quickly why they were pushing me into taking their offer. Three weeks later I had quit. I'll never take an exploding offer seriously again and commend YC for being gracious and flexible in their process.",1237792305
528188,comment,527706,528116,0,0,dejb,,,"> Anyway, there are certain problems that require a ""minimum mental speed"" to accomplish; Mensa test questions are basically designed so that your working memory capacity will be exhausted by extraneous branches unless your mind can cull them as quickly as it can think of them.<p>What about people who have a larger or longer-lasting working memory capacity? Or those who have better culling algorithms? They may be able to solve classes of problems that 'faster' thinkers could never solve. They might do well at the Mensa test but on a simpler speed-based test they could do poorly.<p>Intelligence is not speed.",1237791987

It's their job to rigorously defend it without giving an inch.  The same goes for RMS, it's not his job to convince developers to join up with FOSS.  Leave the convincing to people who are better at it.  Google's summer of code is a great example.<p>Based on the growing size and productivity of the FOSS community, I really don't think RMS needs to change what he is doing.  Programmers have already produced billions of dollars of free software and will continue to do so.  It's an amazing display of our (the hacker) culture.",1237791749

I was actually at the airport to join another program when I followed my gut and took a chance with my Y Combinator application instead. I was subsequently interviewed and accepted, so it worked quite well for me. I would, however, encourage everyone to weigh their options before following their guts as in the end you may get no offers by taking a risk like I did.<p>Probably part of what prompted my decision was how much integrity this other program didn't have relative to Y Combinator (offering perks and having integrity are sometimes inversely proportional).",1237791745

That's my first one :). Now for the constructive ones.<p>The documentation may be fantastic, but it's relatively unapproachable for me; not because of the content, but because of the format. Before I download a project like this (that is likely to consume a bunch of my time), I want to flip through the API documentation and get a good feel for what I'm getting into. Github will automagically format Markdown documents; browsing through that is a lot simpler than trying to install texinfo on my Mac, especially if I'm not yet convinced that I want to sink time into your project.<p>As far as the code goes, this looks very similar to my own personal C style, which means I approve :). Not much to comment on here, it seems reasonably modular and straightforward to follow. I wouldn't call myself either a ZMQ or a Lua master (although I have dabbled in both), and I find this pretty easy to understand.<p>A final thought relates again to the ""barrier to entry"" I mentioned regarding the documentation. Looking at the source, it runs the source from boot.lua after starting up. This file, though, is completely empty. It might be worth it to spend a few hours making a few examples; this can significantly lower the amount of effort required to get started with the project.<p>While making it <i>easier</i> to get started with it, you get an additional benefit (and responsibility) from having example code; the style and the patterns you use in your example code will set the ""standard"" for code that others will write. I've had to explain this time and again to friends and co-workers: example code is documentation, and often it's the only documentation anyone will ever read.<p>Anyway, hope that's helpful :) This looks like a really neat project, and I wish I had time to actually noodle around with it more.",1330797580

3660621,story,,,1,2,whichdan,"Ask HN: Best solution for abstracting billing in a SaaS app?",,"Hi all,<p>I'm currently buidling a SaaS app and looking for software to abstract away their API. I hate writing billing code, and small changes like Stripe's new webhooks[1] can end up being a pain in the arse, not to mention the tons of Stripe-specific code.<p>My main concern is keeping a copy of all transaction data locally, so even if Stripe went down temporarily, I wouldn't be reliant on their API. It's also important for deactivating accounts and other tasks.<p>It seems like Recurly[2] and Chargify[3] only support Braintree, but if I switched to Braintree from Stripe, I'd be looking at nearly $200/mo extra in overhead. OpenGateway[4] is certainly an option, but I have mixed feelings on uses non-open-source software locally.<p>Before this turns into a huge stream-of-consciousness post - has anyone had experience with this particular problem (not wanting to write/maintain billing API code), and are there any other well-developed solutions out there?<p>[1] https://stripe.com/blog/webhooks<p>[2] http://recurly.com/features/payment-gateway-support<p>[3] http://chargify.com/payment-gateways/<p>[4] http://www.opengateway.net/partners",1330797539

Even if you have a new language design, implementing all of the ""basic"" optimizations to bring your compiler from hopeless to merely embarrasing requires person-years of heroic effort, none of which results in publications or other recognition required to keep your NSF funding coming (they're ""basic"").<p>For example, it has taken us since 2007 to get Manticore (<a href=""http://manticore.cs.uchicago.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manticore.cs.uchicago.edu/</a> ) to a point where our sequential performance is within a factor of 2-4 of C (depending on the benchmark), and closing that last bit is probably going to take another couple of years unless we have some magical windfall of stunning undergraduate and graduate student candidates.

In order to cache items effectively, you inevitably have to duplicate ""child"" data inside of ""parent"" entries. Then, when a child is changed, you have to invalidate the child and its parents, and its parents' parents, and so on.<p>To try to help this, I hacked together a simple Node.js library called Stash, which models the cached values as a graph. When you invalidate an item, Stash will walk the graph and invalidate any items that depend on the item that was marked as invalid.<p>The code is available here:<p>https://github.com/nkohari/stash<p>I'm not suggesting that this is by any means a revolutionary idea; it just started as a mental exercise and now I'm wondering if there's any value to continuing to improve it as a library.<p>I'm also interested in what you find to be the most difficult part about caching, and how Stash could be improved to help.<p>Any feedback is appreciated, but bear in mind this is just a few hours worth of work and it has quite a few rough edges. Thanks!",1330796620

I don't expect that to work for still pictures either.<p>2) That argument is null and void as a reason to continue using pinterest.<p>3) As long as they have sufficient funds to wage a war against <i>me</i>, that's all that matters. I don't have many funds, and none to get into a copyright battle over my scrapbook. And if they're an agency, who knows their resource level?<p>4) This is your best bet; the principle is similar to the search engine vs. photographer case mentioned in the article. However, the low-res version is <i>still</i> copyrighted by the photographer/agency. If pinterest created a lower-res version for pinterest, then this defence may work.<p>5) Why do some websites have 'terms and conditions' that forbid linking to them? Why do some people launch a bunch of crazy lawsuits seemingly as a hobby? All it takes is one self-absorbed or mistaken nutcase and your life becomes difficult. Sadly, 9 out of 10 nutcases are either self-absorbed or mistaken. The ratio gets even worse if, for example, the comments listed above say things like ""OMG, what a talentless noob! This photograph is shit and the person that took it is a fucked-up idi0t!"" And, by Gabe's Greater Internet Theory, this will happen somewhere.<p>I like pinterest and I love using the internet to discover new and exciting pictures. I've been following interesting picture soups, tumblrs and even Live Journals forever and I don't want pinterest to die. I don't see why this lawyer is so scared though; the DMCA should force the holder to contact pinterest at their abuse address and they should be able to remove the offending image directly, no?

You save in three big ways with PlanGrid - we are cheaper than printing, faster than dealing with paper for sharing and note taking, and eliminate building from outdated drawings.<p>Our current set of users love having it in the field.

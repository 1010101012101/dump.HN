530383,comment,530189,530334,0,0,briansmith,,,"I understand how process-per-tab protects against cross-domain attacks. In protecting against cross-domain attacks, Chrome's architecture is safer than IE's since IE will often put multiple tabs in the same process.  But, I don't think the number of tabs per process has an effect in the ability to prevent exploits of the local system.<p>The feature of Chrome and IE Protected Mode that protects against local expoits is basically the same. There is a ""main"" process that has access to the local system (files, registry, other processes). And, there are some ""sandboxed"" processes that do not have access to the local system except for a communication channel to the main process. Any time these browsers interpret some input from the internet, they do so only in the sandboxed processes. The only way a sandboxed process can access local resources is by asking the main process to give it the local resource through the communication channel. The main process asks the user to approve the request before accessing the local resource on behalf of the sandboxed process. As long as the main process implements its side of this communication channel correctly, there is no way for malicious web content to break out of the sandbox. That is the case whether there is one tab per process or more than one tab per process.",1237913920

530381,comment,530311,530311,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"People are complaining that this was a destabilizing bill. And yet, the current crisis is largely due to stabilizers: Fannie and Freddie manipulated mortgage prices to make them trade like treasuries, leading to artificial stability; AIG sold CDSs as part of a regulatory arbitrage, leading to a collapse later on; depositors didn't have any reason to care whether their bank was lending to someone who put 50% down on a first home or 0% down on a no-doc third home -- whatever happened, the FDIC would take care of it!<p>It is impossible to imagine an alternative history in which a lack of ostensibly stabilizing regulations led to a larger crisis. These rules will tend to reduce the chance of a small disaster, and amplify the effects of a massive one. Thanks to Fannie and Freddie, housing prices couldn't drop 5% in a year -- they could rise 10%, or they could drop by 20%.",1237913793

''Glass-Steagall was intended to protect our financial system by insulating commercial banking from other forms of risk. It was one of several stabilizers designed to keep a similar tragedy from recurring. Now Congress is about to repeal that economic stabilizer without putting any comparable safeguard in its place.''<p>Supporters of the legislation rejected those arguments. They responded that historians and economists have concluded that the Glass-Steagall Act was not the correct response to the banking crisis because it was the failure of the Federal Reserve in carrying out monetary policy, not speculation in the stock market, that caused the collapse of 11,000 banks. If anything, the supporters said, the new law will give financial companies the ability to diversify and therefore reduce their risks.

Depending on the client, it may mean ""FTP encrypted with SSL"" or ""FTP with encryption extensions of one of a couple of types invented independently by FTP server authors over the years"" or ""SSH File Transfer Protocol"" (which is actually the real meaning of the abbreviation, and was in use for several years before secure FTP began to be common).<p>Historically, people tried to convince folks to call it FTPS (for FTP over SSL, which is the most popular form of secured FTP), but that seems to have never taken off.  Unfortunate, since SFTP means too many incompatible things.<p>It's stabilized somewhat in recent years, and usually clients will do the right thing--and the most common meaning of SFTP has come to be ""FTP encrypted with SSL"" (which is actually one of the weaker forms of security for FTP--but it's got some semblance of ""standardization"", and works in lots of clients and servers, so that makes it superior).  And, of course, there is no RFC defining secure FTP, so it's a de facto ""standard"" which can lead to buggy implementations and a lot of finger pointing--server says client is wrong, client says server is wrong, user says ""I give up"" and uses FTP, instead.",1216063642

But product customers are an entirely different breed. They do have some idea what they want, so it's certainly still correct to go back to your customers to get feedback about your product, but it's misleading to equate these to service customers. With product customers, they won't tell you what they want until you spend much energy eliciting that feedback. It's not ""simply a matter of translating business needs into technical jargon"".",1216062117

245944,comment,245671,245852,0,0,benreesman,,,"Java is an excellent language for writing the kinds of programs that were traditionally written in C but where the performance of Java is adequate (and as the performance of well-written Java programs seems to be asymptotically approaching the performance of well-written C programs this set is larger all the time). In fact, treating Java as a garbage-collected C is often a very reasonable thing to do.<p>People who bitch about how 'Java is dead' are referring (whether they know it or not) to the practice of attempting to write change-prone business logic and other glue in it. This practice was always a bad idea, something that even Sun now seems willing to admit. If the Rails/Django discussion is at the center of someone's programming universe then it is likely that to him or her that this is the only kind of code in the world, and thus Java is of no consequence to those sorts of people.<p>However, if your project is ambitious enough you'll find that you will need both glue and infrastructure, in which case having a language like Java underneath your dynamic language (people who use JRuby for example, or like me, Rhino) will be a godsend when you need performance or the occasional static-typing guarantee.<p>If you'll allow me to make the obligatory pg/Viaweb reference then I'll point out that Viaweb contained non-trivial amounts of both C and Perl, in spite of the obvious advantages of using Common Lisp for the store editor proper.",1216062047

In your Henry Ford example, they know that they want to get from point A to point B faster.<p>Customers don't know the right way of implementing it. That's why they hired you to implement it for them. They don't know that there are better alternatives to ""a faster horse"" out there, or better alternatives to an access-based exchange-and-IIS-powered monster out there.<p>In the end, you have to find the right questions to ask to find out what the customer wants -- this takes skill, and it takes digging, and extracting the essence of their responses. It's part of your job to find out when a customer is telling you what they want, and when they tell you what they think they want, but are really describing the way they think something should be implemented.<p>Figuring out the difference is the hard part.",1216062021

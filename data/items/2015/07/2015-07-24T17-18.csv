So some of these vulns could be baked in, in a way that have expensive work arounds because the car manufacturers have been so feature driven rather than security conscious. It&#x27;s the car equivalent of bloat/crap ware on phones. Features that drive up selling the customer. The cars that have OTA firmware updates (BMW was one example) are able to push out fixes faster, and with more complete coverage than recalls so it seems sane to me to make it mandatory such &quot;smart cars&quot; can be OTA updated.",1437760734

They sometimes accomplish astonishing feats with Excel. They&#x27;re skilled and knowledgeable problem-solvers but they&#x27;re not very likely to  touch a programming environment other than Excel.<p>The reason for this presumably is that spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel in particular have hit a sweet spot of an IDE that sort of covers many common business use cases while still being easy enough to use and getting started with for an intelligent person who knows nothing about programming at first. Spreadsheets are also a very visual environment compared to a text-based programming language.<p>So, yes there&#x27;s lots to improved about handling spreadsheets, making them more testable and scalable but the core - the spreadsheet development environment if you will - isn&#x27;t going anywhere.

9943894,story,,,2,8,seige,"Ask HN: The Case for the “Front End Engineer” Role",,"I&#x27;ve spent 5yrs now doing FE Engineering. In our industry, thats grand total of 0 proof that I know programming. I accept that. What I still don&#x27;t get is the interviewing cycle though. The interviews for the role continue to surprise, borderline shock me.I think I&#x27;ve been lucky to stumble across a few challenging jobs so far. In all of them, the fundamentally challenge was designing curation heavy environments(think photoshop) with lots of JS. This is eventually a systems design challenge rather than algorithm design.<p>This has made be believe that FE roles are primarily system design problems not algorithm design. My belief goes all the way back to the language itself. JS started as scripting language. Not a heavyweight like Java. As AJAX grew as a pattern over the last decade, we wrote lots of tiny scripts. We needed a way to manage  1000s of such snippets. It was driving us crazy. This is where it became a systems design problem. Case in point: rampant growth of JS MVC frameworks.<p>What makes FE Eng. different is that we care for the pixel till the end. Most people don’t internalize that. Just imagine working with illustrator for a day and instead of having a mouse to move objects, now you have to do it with numbers. Most folks with a heavy interest in algorithm design will cry at that task. Thats almost too blue collar for them. Maybe thats true… but that is work! Someone has to do it.<p>I have given interviews at several places now for FE Engineering role. A lot of times interviewers are engineers who think of it as a blue collar job. Hence, it quickly devolves into a self-boasting and a narcissist activity to prove that whose more white collar. The whole experience has an undertone that you are either a failed CS graduate or don’t have a degree and hence you are no match for me.<p>So what am i missing? Are we interviewing the right way or are their gaps in my understanding? Help me understand how i should re-think about it.",1437760688

9943888,comment,9941086,9941086,0,0,dragonbonheur,,,"A programming language that is as easy to write as Excel formulas exists already: It&#x27;s called BASIC. Lots of people fell in love with it since the late 70&#x27;s. Sure it&#x27;s often ridiculed, mostly by people who somehow manage to slide an ill-fitting and unwarranted Djikstra quote in their argument, but the language has evolved with the times and once enabled millions of programmers to earn a respectable and honest living. Dialects like FreeBASIC, QB64, DARKBASIC, XOJO, FNX Basic, AutoIT and GAMBAS may seem very different to one another, but they remain BASIC and easy enough to learn within a week. Communities still flourish and are very tightly knit. Source code, Modules and Libraries are abundant, as are very capable IDEs, together with complete documentation.<p>Go forth(cough) and give FreeBASIC a try for a start. It already runs faster than Python ever will on Linux, DOS32 and Windows. QB64 is cross-platfrom too. If you&#x27;re on the move give RFO BASIC a try, when you get back to your regular PC you can make APKs of the programs you&#x27;ve designed on your tablet. B4J enables you to run your programs on  the Java VM. And if they are still not enough, you can still write your own dialect of BASIC... in BASIC!!!",1437760609

In many societies (but of course not all), women are a protected class of people.  This comes with an assorted set of advantages (less strenuous work, better expected health outcomes, etc.)  The argument is not that these advantages outweigh the disadvantages, or even that they <i>necessarily</i> even them out, but that to ignore them entirely in advancing an argument, and then to immediately attempt to draw (tenuous, at best) parallels to slavery is a disservice to serious discussion.<p>Also, apparently the Godwin&#x27;s law corollary with regard to discrimination is slavery. :/",1437760593

I care about the work on the default theme as I can&#x27;t really be bothered to install custom themes. For me, the same is true for Qt or whatever other toolkit: either they give me appropriate defaults or I will probably tend to ignore them.<p>That said, it seems that GTK+ developers agree with you more than you seem to expect: in the past few cycles they worked <i>a lot</i> on the theming engine, simplifying it to the point that the whole theme is defined only by CSS.<p>Instead of writing clunky, complex loadable modules in C, they can just mash together some CSS and customize every part of the UI. This is a <i>massive improvement</i> over GTK+2.<p>Of course, since the CSS can poke at the deep internals of the toolkit, complete stability cannot be provided: think of it as a user-level CSS that cannot cleanly cope when the target website changes.",1437760509

It&#x27;s a personal tax election that you make by mailing a filing in to the IRS and you can do it without the company&#x27;s involvement or permision.<p>The problem is that 83(b) elections just aren&#x27;t applicable unless (i) you own stock, not options, and (ii) that stock is subject to vesting.<p>Longer explanation:  When you buy something, if you are paying less than the fair market value for that thing, then the spread is taxable income to you.  Typically this spread is calculated at the time of the sale, so if you&#x27;re buying shares at $0.0001 per share and they are currently worth $0.0001 per share, you&#x27;d think there would be no problem.  But the IRS says that if shares are subject to vesting then the spread is actually calculated at the time that the shares vest.  So a common case would be that you buy shares now for $0.0001/share, next year you hit your cliff and a bunch of shares vest, and at that point the price has gone up to say $0.001/share, and you would then owe taxes on the difference between $0.0001 and $0.001 per share.  The 83(b) election gets you out of this trouble by letting you say at the very beginning that you want to be taxed on all shares up front, so the spread is calculated on day one, and is 0, and there&#x27;s no tax liability.<p>So if you own shares and they are subject to vesting, either by a purchase of restricted stock or an option exercise, then yeah, make an 83(b) election and you can do that with or without the company&#x27;s permission.  But if you just own an option that you haven&#x27;t yet exercised then an 83(b) election just doesn&#x27;t apply and it&#x27;s not something the company chooses to allow or not allow.",1437760341

At the end of the day there was a open bar and a sort of sit and hack type event. Nothing particularly structured. Just a &quot;hey I am working on this thing, come and pair with me if you would like.&quot; Matz was working on MRuby at the time and came in. Of course, being relatively well known in the community everyone wanted to pair with him. A lot of people noticed he did not have an alcoholic drink by him while he was hacking away and continually offered or brought him one trying to get him to join in.<p>Matz, on top of being a well known coder, is also a relatively well known Mormon, meaning he doesn&#x27;t drink. He would just politely decline. But the people in the room were getting more and more insistent and later rude. Matz finally excused himself to go back to his hotel room. After he left the room filled with discussion around how Matz was judgemental, or how Matz was loosing touch with the Ruby culture. It was sad and disheartening. A lot of us lost a great opportunity to code with a brilliant person because he wouldn&#x27;t bend to social pressures.<p>I don&#x27;t drink but I have been in many environments where drinking is acceptable, encouraged, or even required. It&#x27;s unfortunate. For me, the evidence shows that drinking copious amounts of alcohol is unhealthy, dangerous, and has very little practical value. Additionally, it can separate us as a community. I hope one day the drinking culture of the tech community will exit.",1437759712

But not airplanes. You even try touching one of them and you will be in for quite a ride through the joys of bureaucracy.<p>It&#x27;s the basis of QA, your customers will use your product in ways you never intended. It could go on to say that through your customers misuse of the product you will be able to make your product better.<p>But with planes, the intended use gets so much more critical and the number of people who test it gets incredibly low. If these systems aren&#x27;t tested, errors wont be found. And one day someone is going to hook up to a plane and try to bring it down. And it is because of this lack of use outside of intention that an attacker will be successful.<p>Obviously, I never want to be on a plane next to a security researcher plugged into the aircraft, but I think the secrecy around aircraft is their biggest vulnerability. A solution that would work somewhat counter intuitively would be parking a plane at LAS this summer for all the Black Hat and DEF CON attendees to play with. The resulting publications would without a doubt revolutionize aircraft security.<p>EDIT:Just fixing some grammar here and there.",1437759517

I&#x27;m not really sure this applies in the unicorn case, though, since the amount of money that they&#x27;re raising in the &quot;private IPOs&quot; they do dwarfs the reporting costs of being a public company.<p>The biggest factor, in my opinion of course, is that some large private investors realized that they could capture most of the upside in an IPO before the IPO actually happened. The first real example of this is DST and Facebook. This has obvious advantages for the private investor -- they get access to a source of high quality risk for their portfolio. It also has obvious advantages for the company -- they get access to capital without having to manage to Wall St&#x27;s expectations (and that&#x27;s no minor thing).<p>Facebook was sort of the proto-unicorn, and it spawned imitators. Those imitators were not just startups, it also spawned imitators on the investment side. Suddenly a source of relatively easy money -- the initial IPO allocation in &quot;sure thing&quot; companies -- weren&#x27;t available to the usual suspects, and those funds have naturally followed the leaders into the D, E, and F rounds of the new breed of unicorns. These deals are even accessible to relative small fry now -- private bankers will routinely shop around access to these funding rounds to people with assets &quot;only&quot; in the 10&#x27;s of millions. Sometimes they&#x27;re shopping a theoretical deal that they want to present to the company in question, and sometimes they&#x27;re shopping AirBnB.<p>At any rate, many of the gains you used to be able to get in companies like Amazon or Google are now going to people able to get access to these pre-IPO deals.

I don&#x27;t really need to point out a study that men are far more likely to end up in prison.<p>>This just makes you sound like someone suffering from confirmation bias.<p>And this sounds like rationalization of why an opinion should be dismissed.<p>>I had to Google this, I assume you mean &#x27;benevolent sexism&#x27;<p>Yes, I did mistype that one and I&#x27;ll go correct it.<p>>I now understand to be the assumption that (for example) women need to be protected by men.<p>That would be an attempt to give an example, though this could also be stated such as the assumption that a man should put a woman&#x27;s safety before his own (not stated in the cost of not doing such, which is often that of not being a &#x27;real man&#x27;).<p>>Again, you jump straight to the conclusion without stopping to reason, which is the same symptom of confirmation bias as above.<p>And yet this is the behavior of many posts taking the opposite view point without their being called out on it.  I find it interesting that the reactions to similar behavior differ.<p>Finally two points.  First, if you want to get people to reconsider their position, logos and ethos will do little alone while relying only on pathos will get you much further.  Evidence and logical arguments are second to emotional appeal.<p>Second, my original point of the post was not to actually say which group had it worse.  Only to explicitly call out that there is not an agreement as to one group having it worse (no need to say which side in such a disagreement is right) so that the parent&#x27;s implied response to both grand parents and great great grandparents point cannot be implied as was done.  An actual discussion trying to determine which gender has it worse would get neither side anywhere unless hours were spent in a Socratic discussion of what worse actually means followed by even more time spent doing data comparisons to what ever agreed upon definition was decided upon.",1437759175

While those are good solid lengths for passwords (in both cases due to the larger character set of Unicode), without knowing exactly how they were calculated it is completely arbitrary.<p>For example for a sentence-based password, 100 bits is insecure. But for a password generated using the secure random number generator, it is absolute unbreakable e.g.<p>&quot;goodnight moon&quot;: Insecure but 120 bits (16 chars) of &#x27;entropy&#x27;<p>&quot;5%ML#_rjMe&quot;: Secure but &quot;only&quot; 80 bits (10 chars) of &#x27;entropy&#x27;<p>Now you could argue, that the word &#x27;entropy&#x27; would discount any sentence based passwords by definition, but that&#x27;s not how I&#x27;ve seen people [mis]use it.

9943612,comment,9942638,9942638,0,0,tokenadult,,,"The write-up about Tao when he was ten years old [1] by Miraca Gross mentions Tao&#x27;s connection to Julian Stanley, the founder of the Center for Talented Youth (CTY) at Johns Hopkins University. I had opportunity to correspond with Stanley before he died, and the evolution of his views about the education of mathematically precocious young people is quite interesting. A 2006 retrospective by Stanley and co-author Michelle Muratori[2] examines the education of Tao and of Lenhard Ng, another very precocious mathematics learner. A key paragraph from the earlier article quotes Tao&#x27;s father: &quot;There is no need for him to rush ahead now. If he were to enter full-time [university] now, just for the sake of being the youngest child to graduate, or indeed for the sake of doing anything &#x27;first,&#x27; that would simply be a stunt. Much more important is the opportunity to consolidate his education, to build a broader base.&quot; I wish every parent of a precocious child had that kind of healthy perspective on the child&#x27;s overall development.<p>Tao&#x27;s father&#x27;s attitude reminds me of the advice on mathematical education given by Fields medalist William Thurston.[3] &quot;Another problem is that precocious students get the idea that the reward is in being &#x27;ahead&#x27; of others in the same age group, rather than in the quality of learning and thinking. With a lifetime to learn, this is a shortsighted attitude. By the time they are 25 or 30, they are judged not by precociousness but on the quality of work. It is often a big letdown to precocious students when others who are talented but not so precocious catch up, and they become one among many. The problem is compounded by parents in affluent school districts who often push their children to advance as quickly as possible through the curriculum, before they are really ready.&quot;<p>AFTER EDIT: Tao&#x27;s write-up of his experience taking the Princeton University general examination for his Ph.D. program in mathematics is quite interesting, and certainly makes him look very normal indeed.[4]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Articles_id_10116.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Articles_id_10116.aspx</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://gcq.sagepub.com/content/50/4/307.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcq.sagepub.com/content/50/4/307.abstract</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0503/0503081v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0503/0503081v1.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://web.math.princeton.edu/generals/tao_terence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.math.princeton.edu/generals/tao_terence</a>",1437758771

I&#x27;ve only worked at one place (out of over a dozen or more) in SV/SF that didn&#x27;t have alcohol on hand and didn&#x27;t drink in the office. I don&#x27;t care if people drink, but when you&#x27;re pushing it onto your employees and former employees, it&#x27;s a huge problem, and most companies in SV/SF are borderline in the pushy area. Simply offering a drink in a situation where the employer has exceptional power over an employee or potential employee (at work or in an interview for example) makes the employee feel like they need to drink to fit in and not get penalized by the company or the bosses.<p>I think most companies and employers don&#x27;t think like that because they simply assume everyone likes to drink which is incredibly closed minded. I&#x27;ve known other people, other than myself, who do not drink or cannot drink (because of unrelated health reasons) feel pressured to drink at work. I&#x27;m sure someone will say that one can refuse. That is true. One can indeed refuse, but not without negative consequences. One cannot refuse and still keep one&#x27;s status and place.

Even for a common library like jQuery: the number of versions of jQuery that are in use is likely above 50, and the number of popular CDNs that host jQuery is surely above 10. So we are hoping that the user will have a cached copy of that exact jQuery version from that exact CDN.<p>This is somewhat similar to the situation we have with operating systems: we created shared libraries to save disk space and memory. These days using them is pretty much pointless and incurs a performance penalty, yet everybody still uses them.<p>For JavaScript, a much better approach is to a) make code Google Closure-compatible, b) compile everything using advanced mode into a single JavaScript file.

9943495,comment,9935590,9936364,0,0,ctx,,,"I&#x27;m by no means an expert, but I&#x27;d say Belgium currently handles privacy in a reasonable manner that&#x27;s definitely more privacy-friendly than the US.<p>Like many countries we have a commission for the protection of privacy to ensure personal data is handled with care. One of its responsibilities is to uphold the proportionality principle. The law mandates that personal data should only be collected in so far it is reasonable to do so and the collection needs to be intended for a specific purpose. The commission usually offers guidance and recommendations in such matters, but they do more than that. A few weeks ago they took Facebook to court because of, in their words, a flagrant breach of privacy legislation. Tracking people without an account and without providing them a way to opt-out was deemed unacceptable.<p>Companies are not the only possible invasion of privacy. The intelligence services are another example. They are monitored by a permanent and independent committee: Standing Committee I. The members are appointed by the Senate and have security clearance. This only started in the early nineties and precisely because there were problems. Now, if there&#x27;s a complaint from a citizen who feels like he or she has been treated unfairly (I&#x27;m guessing this excludes foreigners, not sure), the committee will investigate. Their annual report looks quite interesting, and is way more specific than I expected, but unlike the site it&#x27;s only available in French or Dutch.<p>A citizen can request the files any part of government has on him or her, this includes the intelligence services and state security. Access can be denied in some cases, but the refusal has to be accompanied by a proper explanation.<p>What if the privacy laws aren&#x27;t respected by the government or the police? Entire court cases have been scrapped because the initial phone tap was deemed illegal, thus tainting all subsequently obtained evidence. There needs to be a properly motivated reason to start tapping phones and it&#x27;s only allowed for specific types of crime. Drug dealers and arms merchants have been set free because of (clerical) errors regarding search warrants. The law and the various procedures will probably evolve to fix such issues. I haven&#x27;t quite figured out if this does anything to disrupt parallel construction, but that&#x27;s another matter.<p>Upholding existing laws is only part of the puzzle. Any government can try to pass overbearing and privacy-invading legislation. That doesn&#x27;t have to be malicious in intent. Not everyone agrees on what is an acceptable intrusion on privacy and what is not. Belgium is no exception. A decent example is the recent data retention law, inspired by the EU directive. Law enforcement supported the retention, others did not. A human rights organization (Liga voor Mensenrechten) went to court and the Constitutional Court of Belgium struck down the law.<p>On a different note, large-scale surveillance by the Belgian government seems unlikely. Maybe the government would try if they could, I don&#x27;t know. It probably helps that Belgium is tiny and many of its government agencies, intelligence services included, are not particularly well-funded. Then there&#x27;s the complicated government structure and the wide variety of political parties that have to form coalition governments. Keeping secrets is hard in such an environment. Wild speculation: maybe this is why Belgacom (now Proximus) was hacked instead of formally requesting an exchange of intelligence information?<p>I think (hope?) a more balanced approach like in Belgium can work in bigger countries, further bolstering cooperation between allies. Sensitive personal information can be shared more freely between nations if they offer the same level of privacy protection.",1437757925

They&#x27;re really not the same thing, because they are handling very different risk models. Vehicle safety is about &quot;how will this system perform under typical conditions when something goes wrong?&quot;. Computer security is about &quot;how will this system perform if a smart asshole tries to abuse it?&quot;. Vehicle safety <i>generally</i> doesn&#x27;t concern itself with deliberate sabotage. You won&#x27;t see a product recall for a car because &quot;under some circumstances, a criminal might cut the brake cables&quot;. What Chrysler are doing here is, though, effectively that, and <i>why</i> they have to do that for a computer security issue is interesting.<p>We&#x27;re all used to the idea that if you put a computer on the internet, it will come under attack. People will try to snoop on the data it handles, or subvert it to use it for their own purposes. So why do we then move on to assume that, if such a system is attached to something safety critical, that those same people who will attack the computer to get at its data or processing power will now move on to attacking the brakes, or the engine, and try to kill people?<p>Most vehicular crime isn&#x27;t homicide, it&#x27;s acquisitive - people will attack vehicle security systems to steal the car, or get access to valuable contents. Sabotaging the vehicle to kill the driver is way down the list.<p>As a society we tend to assume that physical security is not the only thing that stops random strangers from trying to kill us. We do not all drive around in armored cars in case someone decides to shoot at us from an overpass. We don&#x27;t all sweep under our car with a mirror for bombs before we get in and start the engine.<p>And it&#x27;s certainly not a failing of Chrysler&#x27;s engineers to adequately consider customer safety that they sell Jeeps which are not bulletproof and which have exposed frameworks on the underside where bombs can be attached.<p>So why is it that we&#x27;re so quick to assume that because a safety-critical computer system is exposed to the internet, that this is the <i>worst thing ever</i>?<p>Is it that as far as physical security of your Jeep goes you only have to trust the people in your neighborhood, but for internet security we have to trust the whole world?",1437757790

You can imagine needing to pay millions of dollars to acquire your options when you don’t have it.<p>Huh? The exercise price for options is established when employees are granted stock options, which almost always occurs at the beginning of employment. Employees can calculate the total cost of exercise based on the information contained in the Notice of Stock Option Grant. You can and should ask for this information before you join a company.<p>If you are granted 100,000 options with an exercise price of $0.20, you know that the total cost of exercise (assuming full vesting) will be $20,000. The company&#x27;s valuation could increase fifty-fold and it wouldn&#x27;t affect the cost of exercise.<p>Companies with skyrocketing valuations can be <i>precarious</i> for employees who join late, but here too employees can calculate everything up front and they should take into concern liquidity risk when evaluating what their options are really worth.",1437757534

Unfortunately &quot;positive discrimination&quot; (an oxymoron I see as often as &quot;reverse sexism&quot; and &quot;reverse racism&quot;) says otherwise.<p>>> Men should not have any reproductive rights.<p>> A woman&#x27;s body is hers to do with as she should wish. Nobody should have operations forced upon them.<p>I never said anything about forcing or denying abortions, only that a woman has the right to cede responsibility for reproduction whereas a man has none.  If a woman chooses to abort or put a child up for adoption, she is well within her rights to do so.  If a man suggests the same thing, he is a &quot;deadbeat&quot;.<p>>> Men should continue paying for a woman&#x27;s lifestyle after a divorce.<p>> Due to the fact that often a carer role is taken by a woman in a patriarchal society, this means that her earning potential and career is sacrificed.<p>Again, &quot;patriarchy&quot; as a concept is farcical, and you&#x27;re completely ignoring a woman&#x27;s own personal responsibilities.  You can either argue that women should be treated as equals, or that they should be treated like children in need of constant care, not both.<p>Also, men are not your personal ATM machines.  If you see a man as only existing to please your handbag appetite, you are objectifying them.<p>>> Men should recognize their &quot;privilege&quot; and be constantly reminded of it, even though being told you should be ashamed of your gender is at the very heart of sexism.<p>> There are advantages that men get because of their sex/gender, and these should be recognised.<p>You&#x27;ve basically repeated what I said, except you seem to think sexism a good thing as long as it targets someone you perceive as &quot;advantaged&quot;.<p>>> Men should not be allowed into women&#x27;s &quot;safe spaces&quot;, implying they are dangerous and intimidating by default. Similarly, men should not be allowed to have their own &quot;safe spaces&quot;, because that&#x27;s sexist and exclusionary.<p>> Due to many women having suffered terrible experiences at the hands of men, and the tendency for men to dominate discussions, there needs to be a place away from that where people can talk without fear and interruption.<p>Men also can and do suffer terrible experiences as the hands of women, and can be dominated by them.

But Barbie is responsible for decades of female self-image issues.<p>> Not sure about that one, I think the argument drastically varies, but men are more often portrayed in a powerful, dominant role.<p>So as long as an exaggerated body image is accompanied by power and dominance, it shouldn&#x27;t place unfair expectations on impressionable viewers?<p>>> If a female character chooses to dress provocatively, it is because a man chose to objectify her, not because a woman can take charge of their own sexuality.<p>> Characters are often designed by men, for men.<p>Bayonetta was developed by a woman.  Women are allowed to be sexual if they please, and even if the character is designed by a man, ignoring the potential for sexuality in a woman&#x27;s personality would result in one-dimensional and frankly unrelatable characters.<p>The idea of sexuality as being negative is also unhealthy, for both genders.<p>>> If a man is harassed online, it&#x27;s unfortunate (sometimes). If a woman is harassed online, it&#x27;s representative of a disturbing trend. Similarly, men cannot understand the plight of a woman&#x27;s harassment, even if said man also receives daily death threats and has had a gun fired through their living room window.<p>> Yes because receiving some flame or smack is the same as constant rape threats.<p>You must have missed the part where I mentioned men also get serious threats to their person, and that there are documented cases where those threats have been acted upon.<p>>> Men should receive much harsher punishments than women for committing the same crimes.<p>> This is bullshit, obviously.<p>Yes, obviously.<p><a href=""http://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_gender.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_gender...</a>",1437757489

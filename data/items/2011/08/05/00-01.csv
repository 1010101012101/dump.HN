2848512,story,,,1,1,EwanG,"Ask HN: iPad2 4.3.5 wifi issues, help find a solution?",,"Just received my new iPad 2 straight from Apple last night. Came with 4.3.5 preinstalled. Was tearing my hair out over connectivity issues until I found that turning off the WEP or WPA or WPA2 - i.e. turn off all security - ""fixes"" it.<p>So tonight I spent some time trying things with the iPad 2 and a monitor on the router.<p>If ANY type of security is turned on, then the router sees the iPad 2 connect, but shows it as having the IP of ""0.0.0.0"". If I try to enter a static IP, this makes no change at the router, and there is no obvious change at the iPad 2. If instead I try to use DHCP, then the iPad 2 initially shows nothing. If I renew lease I then show an IP of ""169.254.176.38"" and a subnet mask of ""255.255.255.0"", although the router still sees it as 0.0.0.0.<p>Once I turn off security, then DHCP works. HOWEVER, if I try to setup a Static IP it STILL does DHCP as evidenced by the fact that disconnecting and reconnecting the iPad gets an IP address that is NOT the one I have put in with the Static IP.<p>Since it works without dropping with security turned off, I doubt this is a hardware issue. I am wondering if ""fixing"" certificates in 4.3.5 broke something else?",1312505912

Maybe Apple uses machines from a particular segment of the market that has dried up supply, but it is rare that a company has too much demand for a product and isn't interested in building more.<p>EG: There's no evidence Apple has cornered the market on CNC machines, which can come from a wide variety of companies.<p>However, companies like Foxconn, do invest billions in buying large quantities of such tools and then dedicate them to manufacturing apple products, because Apple's specifications require them to do so. (This from an article I read interviewing Foxcon's founder.)  The Band on the iPhone 4 required 1,000 custom metal machines, for instance.

For one, Google doesn't have close to the monopoly that MS had. For another, it's really hard to draw the line between the products, and equally hard to say whether Google's use of its search engine to point to its own services is unfair, if it really believes its own products are better. I would characterize their position on this issue as still some distance from MS + IE on the 'fair' to 'unfair' spectrum, but still in 'fair' territory.

2848481,comment,2848239,2848239,8,0,pkulak,,,"In my experience Node.js is more difficult than synchronous code. But it's also, by far, the easiest way to get something running that's massively parallel.<p>I recently wrote a project that needs to do 100's or 1000's of possibly slow network requests per second. The first try was Ruby threads. That was a disaster (as I should have predicted). I had an entire 8-core server swamped and wasn't getting near the performance I needed.<p>The next try was node. I got it running and the performance was fantastic. A couple orders of magnitude faster than the Ruby solution and a tenth of the load on the box. But, all those callbacks just didn't sit right. Finding the source of an exception was a pain and control flow was tricky to get right. So, I started porting to other systems to try to find something better. I tried Java (Akka), EventMachine with/without fibers, and a couple others (not Erlang though).<p>I could never get anything else close to the performance of Node. They all had the same problems I have with Node (mainly that if something breaks, the entire app just hangs and you never know what happened), but they were way more complicated, _harder_ to debug, and slower.<p>I have a new appreciation for Node now. And now that I'm much more used to it, it's still difficult to do some of the more crazy async things, but I enjoy it a lot more. It's a bit of work, and you have to architect things carefully to avoid getting indented all the way to the 80-char margin on your editor, but you get a lot for that work.",1312505269

And, quite in opposition to your viewpoint, this kind of environment brings out all the racism, sexism, homophobia, mob rule, and other assholery you can imagine. Still, people participate in that kind of free for all, and they're free to do so.<p>Outside of 4chan, people are figuring out that online communities, just like communities in real life, work better when there's a social contract. You can get downvoted into oblivion, flagged to death, or hellbanned from Hacker News, but you accept these infringements on your freedom of expression because it keeps the trolls out. Social networks (which, if you've forgotten, are designed to enable communication between people who already know each other, largely in real life) enforce a social norm (or in some cases an actual policy) of using real names. This makes people you know in real life (presumably by their real names) easier to find, and makes your behavior accountable to your real-life reputation.<p>Now, maybe some of these social contracts are wiser than others. But unlike <i>the</i> social contract that governs a physical community[1], online communities are trivial to join, trivial to leave, and not that difficult to form in comparison. This is a freedom of association that's unprecedented in world history, and really gives us the best of both worlds.<p>Finally, if you're all that angry about ""privileged western jagoffs"" forming their own exclusionary communities, you'd be better served railing against e.g. the Freemasons, rather than Google+.<p>[1] It's worth pointing out that most countries have very strict laws mandating that people are known to the government, their employers, etc. not only by a ""real name"" that requires legal action to change, but by some sort of identification number.

You can _easily_ make sure you'll never be disturbed in that perfect world of 'valid' names.<p>I see no freedom issues here?<p>The _real_ issue is, that you want your personal believe, which in this case might align with what Google arbitrary enforces or not, forced upon everyone. To save you those 2 clicks. And maybe (I'm not trying to make this a personal attack, but this is more or less the only reason I can actually imagine as being 'pro real names' among users) you just don't want to end up in the dilemma that your mum is listed as KnittingGoddess and your girlfriend as PinkUnicorn, because that would mean that you'd either have to block them or - cope with other people's choice of a name.<p>Again, your argument is really, really backwards. I was suspended on G+ because of a name that didn't conform to the rule (intentionally, I set it to ""short-version-of-firstname ."", as a protest. It was my real name before) Now - did you see me somewhere? To help you out: I'd be ""Ben ."". Have you seen me in your circles? In your incoming stream? No? So... Why do you bother?<p>YOU are in charge of your personal network. Here, like in any other social network. Over at FB you'd just not befriend me. Here you'd just not put me in a circle. If I'd do that though you'd notice that a creepy person with no real name is in your incoming stream and you'd block me easily. Done.<p>You _have_ your environment. You still fail to understand the difference between rules about one's own profile (""I'd like to be darklajid"") and some weird filtering that is going to happen anyway, names or not (""I'd like to see nothing but realnames"").<p>Listen - you can choose what you see on the network. I want to choose what represents me. You have to use the controls I talked about (i.e. blocking users) _anyway_, because you'll encounter people that you don't care about/that annoy you.

It's an obstruction to funding and research, rather than to terraforming directly - just as news like this is an encouragement.<p>I do not think terraforming need be terribly expensive, incidentally. We already map a great number of asteroids and comets out of awareness that if a sufficiently large one were to hit the Earth its impact would be devastating. Our best understanding at present of how to deal with the possibility of such an impact is to give the item a slight nudge that will alter its trajectory during a non-terminal interaction with Earth's gravitational field. We have already matched speeds with and made very close observations of asteroids, and our observational abilities are constantly improving. So to begin the work of terraforming Mars, I would begin looking for asteroids with large quantities of ice (or ammonia or other appropriate compounds) that  are likely to intersect closely with Mars' orbit, and give them an encouraging nudge.<p>It annoys me that since the two rovers we've sent so far have worked so well, our response is to spend years developing a New and Better Rover at great expense, rather than launching launching a large number of rovers that use the existing design which is already known to work, and which can be done without any additional research whatsoever.",1312502611

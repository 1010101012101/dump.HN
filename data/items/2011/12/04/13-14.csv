3310672,comment,3309185,3309414,3,0,masklinn,,,"> I suspect there is at least one person who thought it over and genuinely thinks their font rendering is the better choice.<p>Basically, the OSX font rendering is as close as they can to print, where the Windows font rendering gives primacy to on-screen font clarity. This leads to a ""fuzzier"" OSX look, but a much better match to the actual typeface where windows's renderer ""breaks"" fonts to make them ""clearer"".<p>This, of course, comes in no small part from Jobs's background in loving the written/printed word. I'm sure it's also helped by the Mac background/history in design and print.",1323007138

3310659,comment,3309814,3310178,5,0,9999,,,"Lytro's light field is a bullshit product that very few photographers and even fewer consumers will actually give a shit about.  Nikon, Canon, etc. have made far more significant advances in the last five years than Lytro.  Here is a short list of reasons why Lytro's product is just a big ball of hype:<p>1) Horrible low light performance from the sensor, which they have deflected by talking up the relatively large aperture of their lens, which is not really even that impressive (f/0.95 would be impressive, maybe even an f/1.4, but f/2?  go buy a Panasonic LX5, it blows the Lytro out of the water).\n2) No one cares about adjusting focus after the fact, get it right the first time, or don't bother. Even when you can adjust the focus, 99.9% of the time, that feature is only useful for macro photography, which is generally tightly controlled and reproducible at the time of exposure\n3) The resolution sucks.\n4) The form factor is way too big for a supposedly revolutionary product\n5) There is no convenient way to share your photos directly from the device\n6) Slow frame rate (again, even the lowly and well aged LX5, which you can buy for around $270 on Amazon right now, blows it out of the water)\n7) The UI sucks.  They're going for Apple level quality there, but they're a bunch of third rate amateurs.\n8) Only hobbyists and pros want to fiddle with an image after it's taken, your average Joe just wants it to look great the second they take it.  What's better, red eye reduction in some software on your computer or red eye reduction in the camera?<p>You know who gives a shit about Lytro?  Gadget bloggers do, because it's something new.  That's it.  The technology is hardly revolutionary.  Due to the small sensor size in what they're offering, it's pretty hard to even tell you've shifted focus in anything other than a macro shot.  Go look at this example:<p><a href=""http://www.lytro.com/living-pictures/144"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lytro.com/living-pictures/144</a><p>This is one of the very few honest examples in their gallery.  You can barely detect the focus shift because the depth of field is pretty high already, which is commonly the case with the cameras average users have embraced (wide angle lenses and a small aperture mean that almost any cell phone will guarantee that everything is in focus in a daylight pic). Furthermore, for the vast majority of photography there are not multiple points that <i>should</i> be in focus.  99% of the time, you either want everything in focus or only one thing in focus.  Look at this example:<p><a href=""http://www.lytro.com/living-pictures/138"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lytro.com/living-pictures/138</a><p>Why would I want only one in focus??  So my gadget blogging buddies can fiddle fuck around with it using some proprietary widget on some website?  Jesus.<p>Lightfield's everything in focus tech comes at a cost that is far, far too high.  None of Kodak's expertise can correct for that, because it is basically a question of processing power and what the sensor is optimized for.  What do you want?  High resolution?  Great low light sensitivity?  Super high frame rates?  Selective focus in editing? Super long battery life? You can't have them all. Consumers won't care about it, pros don't care about it, and there will be a terrible, terrible bunch of reviews as soon as they get to market.  I wish they were public so I could short them.<p>Lenticular printing?? Seriously?  Hollywood and every TV manufacturer are slowly realizing (again, because they like to do this every 40 years or so) that almost no one cares about 3D TVs or programming. You want Kodak to go down that path in a format where it's not even as beneficial?<p>Printing 3D objects is something Kodak could go after, but do they have any expertise whatsoever in that field?  Creating a truly revolutionary digital camera (e.g. something that captures things people actually care about, like crazy fast action at a kid's soccer game from 30 yards away like the new Nikon V1 can, and can be shared instantly) is another thing they should go after.<p>Lightfield.

But with a few caveats:<p>- The customers doesn't communicate in ""requirements"". They communicate in ""I want to achieve X"". When they do seem to communicate in requirements, it's always because they want to achieve some X, and there might be a better way of doing that. Uncovering X and mapping it to something that's feasible and coherent with the direction the application is going is an essential part of the job.<p>- Ensuring consistent communication, including providing a single point of entry for the customers. Making sure that customers always receive <i>either</i> a firm commitment or a firm non-commitment. No ""I'll look into that"" which is interpreted as ""It's done"". No playing developers out against each other (""But your colleague <i>promised me</i>, I really need this tomorrow."").<p>- Responsibility for the big picture. If keeping the big picture is trivial, you probably don't need product guys. But after a certain degree of complexity, being able to tune out everything but the task you're working on is good for developer productivity.<p>- The buck stops here. A while ago our team wanted to remove a screen from the product because it carried some legacy dead weight. They went to the PMs and got the go ahead. Now, it turned out that PMs were wrong, and the screen had to be put back in after some loud calls from users (which went to client managers and PMs, not developers). Developers were held free of responsibility (and PMs did a root cause analysis). I imagine that if developers were held responsible for this error, it would increase friction as everybody would scramble to make sure they have their back covered whenever something changes.",1323006577

3310617,comment,3309108,3309278,2,0,willyt,,,"I have heard that the admissions procedure is similar for top UK universities, Oxford, Cambridge etc. Except that they have a policy to openly discriminate against privately educated pupils. You need better exam results to get through the first filters if you come from a private school than if you come from a state school. This is because private schools drive their students harder, have better facilities, lower staff/student ratios, less problems with disruptive behaviour etc. However, they also tend to produce lots of stereotypical 'public school boys' (A British cultural meme). Universities prefer diversity. So, if you are privately educated, to do well in the admissions procedure you need good grades and a distinctive resume / personality.<p>But this is quite different to discriminating on grounds of race, as patio11 describes. If it's really true that Asian pupils are discriminated against purely because of a tick box then this is clearly racist even if it's because of the supposed 'hothousing' effect of Asian attitudes towards studying. Is this kind of discrimination not illegal in the US? In Britain and probably most of Europe it is illegal to discriminate on grounds of race, sex, religion, sexual orientation and disability.",1323004939

A smart-phone application would make the data readable again (decryption). You would need to whisper a secret key personally into your friends ear, so he can enter the sequence into his smartphone app. All-in-all it was a concept to use png's like videos with ""cut-scenes"" a-like qr-code's that get multiplied and cross-checksummed afterwards.

Because RULES are stupid. Literally, they don't look at one's specific situation or view point, rules are blanketed over everyone. Despite them being dumb as fuck like ""speed limits"". Study after study shows that when speed limits are removed, accidents go down. (State revenue from tickets does too).<p>Did you know that in many cities you have to pay $25 and fill out a form to get a permit to have a fucking Yard Sale. No body even knows, or follows it, but it's a law.<p>These ridiculous rules have created imbalances in our society. People/businesses who HAVE money can easily apply for permits and licenses and continue making MORE money. PEOPLE who NEED money can't afford these things.<p>""Well that's spam"" some people say. And what the fuck is ADVERTISING (billboard, junk mail, posters)? State sponsored spam. So rich people can spam and make money but poor people can't?! Those with money can advertise on billboards on the side of highways that distract you from driving, they can advertise on TV commercials, they can advertise using Junk mail which cannot be stopped because there's no ""do not mail"" list. People with money are allowed to piss us all off. But when those who don't have money try to advertise using plastic signs on the side of public roads, that's ""illegal"" and they get taken down within 24 hours by the city. There's no place for people without money to get free advertising or a place for them to sell their products or services. Hell, we can't even start businesses in our own homes because of zoning laws.<p>And we're going to sit here and talk about rules... Fuck the rules.",1323004714

3310603,comment,3307748,3309328,1,0,mikk0j,,,"Thanks for the comment!<p><i>I have to wonder where you think the money will come from? What will be the motive to donate?</i><p>If this is a question about the crowfunding site itself, this is a non-issue. Any running costs will be covered. Donations are not required. If the service becomes meaningful to a lot of people, there will be motivated people to support it in different ways.<p><i>Do you have experience with the not for profit model?</i><p>Some, yes. I don't mean to brush aside your valid concerns for the long-term financial health of the project, but the initial costs will not be unsurmountable.<p><i>I have serious financial problems and could use the money. I wish I could find a way to crowd fund what I do. If I do, most likely that won't be called ""crowd funding"". It will be called ""sales to the public"", perhaps in the form of t-shirts, merchandising, etc.</i><p>So this is part of the reason why I want to do this. A lot of people creating content have to just throw the content out there and hope it sticks and is monetizable. The crowdfunding model however is a good ""sales to the public"" model, I think, especially when used as a pre-demand and pre-order model. The biggest projects on Kickstarter for example have been pre-demand projects, where someone has created a wriststrap for the iPod Nano or a tripod mount for a camera phone and sold pre-orders for these.<p>We know that digital content is distributed freely, and this will not go away. For a writer, for example, this can be a serious problem. Say you create a non-fiction how-to book on something very specific and niche. A couple of people buy the ebook, and finding value in it, want to share it with the people they know in the same niche. They (at least many think this way) get more social value out of just sharing a digital copy of your work, instead of pointing their friends to buy it. If you flip this model, and ask for money upfront for the upcoming content, the same person who has donated will now be more inclined to find others to donate too, so that the content will actually get created (this is why Kickstarter's pledge minimums work to motivate sharing). Of course, in addition to getting the content among the first, they can get other perks. By all means you can consider this pre-sales or pre-demand instead of crowdfunding.<p>But that's going into the CF model in general. If people benefit from a new platform like this and it creates more copyright-free content while supporting the creators of such content, as far as I'm concerned it's successful.",1323004582

If it was the actual red/white/black Nazi design, I'd definitely ask about it and he'd have to come up with a reasonable excuse as to why he is receiving these magazines--and then I'd believe him knowing that actual neo-Nazis never apologize or make excuses but will be frank and confronting about their beliefs and the ones that aren't also tend to make sure their neighbours don't see their propaganda mail.<p><i>However</i>, you can't compare that to a cartoon devil in sneakers. If that computer screen had displayed <i>Powered by <image of a pentagram with a goats head in a circle with occult symbols></i> then, yeah, I couldn't blame anyone for at least wondering if they might be Satan-worshippers :) And if fundie Christians want to get all offended and freak out at Satanists, I'm going to say, have at it. While actual Satanists are generally rather harmless, they are also generally enormous pricks. It might even give me short pause and wonder whether I'd reconsider staying at that hotel, but in the end the potential for hilarity would probably win out.<p>No, this is more like: Your neighbour receives a magazine with a swastika on it that doesn't actually have anything to do with Nazis, like maybe he is a Hindu. Just like the BSD logo doesn't have anything to do with the devil or satan, but is a play on the word ""daemon"". In that case, maybe you don't know it, you ask him, he tells you, and since the magazine says <i>Modern Hindu Magazine</i> (health & lifestyle for the modern Hindu!) and the swastika is yellow with orange, you figure that he's probably not a neo-Nazi.",1323004260

121688,comment,121508,121508,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"How about this one...<p><pre><code>    js> r = RegExp(""asdf"", ""g""); \n    /asdf/g \n    js> r.test(""asdf"") \n    true \n    js> r.test(""asdf"") \n    false \n    js> r.test(""asdf"") \n    true \n    js> r.test(""asdf"") \n    false\n</code></pre>\nSurprisingly this is not a bug, though I was certain it was at first. When using the global flag the RegExp object will keep track of the last matching character <i>position</i> and start the next comparison at that position (after the 4th character, in this case) which results in this seemingly incorrect alternation between ""asdf"" matching ""asdf"". Removing the global flag produces correct results.",1203723810
121687,comment,120857,121027,0,0,yagibear,,,"Thanks for the link; I've always been an Asimov fan.  The short story format is fine for entertainment, but takes a while to get to the point:<p><i>Tapes are actually bad. They teach too much; they’re too painless. A man who learns that way doesn’t know how to learn any other way. He’s frozen into whatever position he’s been taped. Now if a person weren't given tapes but were forced to learn by hand, so to speak, from the start; why, then he’d get the habit of learning, and continue to learn.</i><p>I've never questioned the goal of schools to develop learning and thinking skills, rather than just convey content.  However, the question is <i>with what content should those skills be developed?</i>  It is that choice that requires a delicate balance between fundamental and practical content.",1203723808
121686,comment,121508,121677,0,0,randrews,,,"== needs two arguments of the same type. If they're both strings, it's a string compare. If they're objects, it does whatever it does for objects (identity, I think). If they're numbers, then it's a numeric comparison.<p>If it's given two objects of different types, then it has to coerce one of them. In this case, I would expect it to coerce null to 0, then compare 0==0.<p>Your way would have it coerce 0 to false and null to false, so it's still equal, but it has to coerce two things.<p>I can sort of see the logic in this though, since a lot of other languages (SQL) have the rule that nothing is allowed to be equal to null.",1203723801

121683,comment,121398,121463,0,0,cawel,,,"That is interesting. The problem we're facing is fluff, so it seems fair to devise a strategy targeting fluff specifically. I have a hunch that fluff climbs up to the top because of a small group of happy-fluff-voting people (young accounts for some, as PG noted earlier in another thread). If this assumption is right, we could rely on the whole HN community for flagging fluff out effectively, as those happy-fluff-voting people are a minority.<p>I'd discard ideas like allowing downvotes on articles. I do think the decision (by design) not to have downvotes reduces immature voting and also makes it clearer to detect suspect behavior, just like the fluff problem we're facing at the moment (e.g. 20 downvotes added to 40 upvotes brings a total of 20 votes, and thus reduces the alarm signal).",1203723568

121679,comment,121508,121652,0,0,tolmasky,,,"This happens when putting a newline between return and any value.<p>This is actually a result of JavaScript's lax support of semi-colons.  Semi-colons are generally not enforced in JavaScript, but this leads to some ambiguous cases.  Your case may not seem ambiguous, but the following code snippet will show what is actually going on:<p>if (i==5)\n   return<p>i += 3;<p>As you can see, there are 2 possible meanings for this when there is no explicit semi-colon after the return.  It can either mean ""if i equals 5 return, else add 3 to i"" or it could mean, ""if i equals 5 return i plus 3"".  JavaScript does not try to discern which is ""more correct"" (since there are no return types on functions so this would be a very difficult task), but rather defaults to ""floating returns"" meaning ""return;"".",1203723228

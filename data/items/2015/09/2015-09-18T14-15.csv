And in the rare instances when I&#x27;ve offered this advice or help after one or more requests, it has been invariably met with an attitude either that I am wrong/stupid for coming to such a conclusion (e.g. not enough education, or no experience with something we want someone to have experience in) or a flat out request to give them another shot.",1442588362

That would have terrible cache implications.<p>The only thing that sorta works is something like WebKit&#x27;s PartitionAlloc, but that only mitigates some exploitation scenarios.

Absent any pre-existing business agreement (forbidden by the competition rules), the future disposition of that codebase requires unanimous assent of all 9 owners.  No single member can use any of it without permission from all the others.<p>If Billy already was 50/50 owner with another person on a completely unrelated LLC, it would have to license/purchase the code from the entire group of 9 to use it.  As the 0.4% deal was agreed to at the start, it is unlikely that licensing/purchase agreement would be accepted without including that provision.<p>Ideally, each member of the team (including Billy), gets a 1/9th split of the prize winnings.  Billy-the-LLC buys the code from Billy-the-team-member at a reasonable price, and each member gets 1/9th of that.  Additionally, Billy has to grant each other team member 0.4% ownership stake in his LLC, or they never agree to sell their code.<p>The team members, of course, surely realize that 0.4% is going nowhere if Billy is trying to run a tech-based business without respecting the nerds, so they might just sell it right back to him while he is still full of himself, and before he realizes that he is dead in the water when the first customer makes its first feature request.<p>The end result is that the 8 nerds get a nice paycheck for one weekend, and Billy gets a stale codebase that he can still monetize through excessive schmoozy salesmanship.

Basically, if Apple thinks something is a power user feature most users will not need then they have no qualms about not making it discoverable. They tend to even go a step further: they may outright hide it, making it impossible for users to ever be confused by it.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad design pattern (depending on context and circumstances, obviously, as always), you just have to make the right judgement calls about what&#x27;s important and has to be discoverable and what&#x27;s not.

This can cause agonizing pain and terrible anxiety, and people can resort to extreme behaviors to relieve their symptoms, often becoming violent.<p>This has been known for a while now. If you look at the references on the Wikipedia page for akathisia, you find one paper linking antidepressant-induced akathisia to violence from 2006:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1564177/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1564177/</a><p>Quoting from that paper on akathisia:<p>“Increased tenseness, restlessness, insomnia and a feeling of being very uncomfortable”.<p>“On the first day of treatment he reacted with marked anxiety and weepiness, on the second day felt so terrible with such marked panic at night that the medication was cancelled”.<p>“The first few doses frequently made them anxious and apprehensive. They reported increased feelings of strangeness, verbalised by statements such as ‘I don&#x27;t feel myself’ or ‘I&#x27;m afraid of some of the unusual impulses I have&#x27;’.<p>&quot;Events such as these in clinical trials of antidepressants have commonly been coded under headings such as agitation, emotional lability, and hyperkinesis (overactivity), and only rarely to akathisia.&quot;<p>The good thing is that you can treat akathisia with common medicines already used to treat anxiety, such as benzodiazepines. The bad thing is that since information on side effects has been suppressed, patients are not likely to know what is happening to them and how to treat it, won&#x27;t get the help they need, and run the risk of hurting themselves or others.",1442585850

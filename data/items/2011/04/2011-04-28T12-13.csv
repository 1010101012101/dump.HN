I did that because .doc is not a standardised format, does not make the promise to look right on any system, and doesn't support some of the nicer typesetting I have going on. In my opinion, forcing people to use a proprietary locked-down format is the kind of thing that should be fought. What really gets my goat is that most of these places still don't accept .docx, even though it is standardised, well-supported, and absolutely TRIVIAL to pull plaintext out of for indexing purposes.<p>However, because I took the initiative to teach myself an industry standard text markup language in order to make a CV that looks really nice and will always display and print properly (and is distributed in the most widely-agreed upon document format for that purpose), you want to exclude me? I'm not submitting in PDF to be difficult or to take a stance, it's a convenient, standardised and well supported format which I am using for its intended purpose.<p>Comparing smoke signals to PDF is completely disingenuous, as is bundling together ""people who happen to submit their CV to you as a PDF"" and ""people who would flat-out refuse to submit their CV as a .doc"".",1303995408

Low-carb diets are an effective way to do this, because they are generally restrictive (less variety means less overeating) and because protein is very satiating. But there are other ways, and yes, some of them involve eating a lot of carbohydrates. The best thing is to choose something you can stick with. In that sense, your advice is not good, since 50-60% protein would make a lot of people want to barf.<p>I would go so far as to say there is no such thing as a diet that is ""healthy"" absent particular health goals.

Lisa: Are you a developer or advertiser?<p>Me: developer<p>Lisa: Great
Lisa: Regarding your question, you can which users will receive your ad and that too how often
Lisa: adjust*<p>Me: How does a user know which app is sending the ads?<p>Lisa: It will be reflecting your developer's dashboard once you start listing your apps<p>Me: i.e. User X updates a dozen apps and suddenly starts getting notification ads. How do they know which app is creating them?
Me: I'm talking about end users here
Me: not developers or advertisers<p>Lisa: ok
Lisa: There is an API key through which you can control the user engagements
Lisa: by a push notofication ad<p>Me: I don't understand how that sentence relates to my question.<p>Lisa: in this case, the users will receive the ad any time an ad is pushed to a device, whether or not the user actually views the ad or not.<p>Me: I asked how a user knows which app triggered an ad.<p>Me: are ads labelled with the originating app name?<p>Lisa: He will be receiving it in a push notification tray<p>Me: are ads labelled with the originating app name?<p>Lisa: Just give me a moment. let me check<p>Me: To repeat an earlier example - User X updates a dozen apps and suddenly starts getting notification ads. How do they know which app is creating them?<p>Lisa: for each app they need to setup airpush sdk so they will get the report data in their airpush controlpanel<p>Me: That doesn't answer my question. Do you understand what I'm asking you?
Me: Imagine I am a user.
Me: I install several apps and one of them contains Airpush.
Me: I suddenly get notification ads and want to know which app is creating them. How can I tell?
Me: Are you still there?<p>Lisa: It depends on the app setting and cannot control that
Lisa: And the ads are not labelled with the originating app name?<p>Me: If a user dislikes the ads - is there any way for him to know which app caused it? I'm worried I'll get bad ratings.<p>Lisa: No 
Lisa: The user will not know<p>Me: Hopefully users won't know it's my app that's doing it so they won't uninstall my app.<p>Lisa: No don't worry about that. 
Lisa: Here you can also benefit through inactive users as you can configure your settings to deliver ads to users who haven't used an app for X days<p>Me: And they won't know it's me?<p>Lisa: No not at all.<p>Me: Cool.
Me: OK. You seem quite happy to support developers who knowingly spam their users. Do you mind if I publish a transcript of this conversation so other people can see how little regard you have for end-users?
Me: Hopefully it will hasten the speed at which your nasty company goes out of business<p>Lisa: Surely it will not.<p>Me: It's a very revealing conversation.<p>Me: Thank-you for being so candid.<p>Lisa: But I believe we maintain our privacy<p>Me: Who's privacy?<p>Lisa: And as long as we receive good responses, we will definitely look up to everyone's reputation<p>Me: Do you receive good responses from end-users?<p>Lisa: Yes definitely.<p>Me: Like all the users of APN Droid who have been leaving 1 star reviews and complaints on the Market?<p>Lisa: Anyways you can download our SDK and start listing your apps if you are happy with it.<p>----------------------

I said <i>the west</i> (that's not just the US, you know?).<p>>you are competing with programmers in Ireland, Australia, South Africa, Israel, Holland, Germany, New Zealand and so on.<p>I already am.  Every one of them that is willing to move where I live.  The only difference is that neither they, nor I would have to move if we moved to telecommuting.  This would depress the value of labor somewhat because commute hassles are figured into the current price, but I don't believe we would be looking at a long term 50% decrease.<p>>and in many cases require a living wage below that found in the US.<p>Irrelevant.  Market prices are set based on perceived value of the good or service.  Not what it costs to produce or anything like that.<p>> But are you still the best if we expand the pool to include a billion people?<p>No of course not, but we're not all competing for one job.  If all programming jobs became telecommuting jobs then I would be competing with everyone but for every job.",1303993632

Reading this thread only backs up my own thoughts and reasons why I dislike these articles.<p>First of all, everyone has their own idea of healthy.<p>Second, there are so many different diets, fads, foods, etc to eat or follow that's it ridiculous to even argue one way or another. Some eat lots of protein, some eat lots of fat, some eat low fat and high carbohydrates and everyone believes their method or means of eating is healthy. I'm sure no matter which way anyone argues there is a book, article, pubmed article to back up your ways. Making statements such as that can't be healthy, or you need to eat vegetables, fats, a certain amount of calories, and other similar statements is only someone else's opinion or belief and everyone is different.<p>Go with what makes you feel good. The best diet is the one you can follow. Listen to your body.<p>I would down vote this, but I can't down vote yet.<p>I'll probably get down voted for all this text, but I feel that strongly about this.<p>Frankly, what else bothers me is that almost any time someone expresses disagreement, they get down voted.

4008428,comment,4008107,4008230,6,0,moe,,,"Same here.<p>As much as I like vim - it remains software from the stone age and it seems absurd that our main work interface (editor and shell) still consists of an emulated 1980s text-mode terminal.<p>LightTable looks like a major step in the right direction. I think the best indicator for success will be when the vim/emacs-diehards start porting their respective shortcuts and functionality over.<p>I could very well see this fundamental approach (modular/dynamically expanding interface) become the new paradigm for editors and (hopefully) terminals if the author manages to make the prototype versatile and hacker-friendly enough.<p>We've really been entrapped inside ancient TTY-emulations and inadequate GUI-widget sets for way too long.",1337702358
4008427,comment,4007551,4008189,9,0,dagw,,,"<i>Where are all of these ""incredibly cheap"" handsets? ZTE? Huwei? The overwhelming bulk of Android handsets are priced similarly to the iPhone.</i><p>Not even close to true.  Having a look at my favorite purveyor of phones (www.katshing.se) I see that, by far, the most expensive phone they sell is the 64GB 4s and the only phones that are close to the price of a 16GB 4s is HTC One X, the Galaxy Note and the preorder for the Galaxy SIII.<p>In the half-the-price-of-the-4s category you have some pretty decent phones like the HTC OneV, Experia Arc S and Samsung Galaxy S plus.  Halving the price again (~$250) and you can get a Samsung Galaxy Ace, HTC Explorer or Wildfire S or Motorola Defy Mini.<p>The simple truth is that probably half the people I know with android phones have android phones because they where a lot cheaper than the iPhone.  The fact that you can buy a great smart phone from a brand name like Samsung for $200 unlocked and off contract is incredibly enticing to a large number of people, and Android helped make that happen.",1337702353

But its really wrong to say IDE's like Eclipse don't do one specific task well.<p>Eclipse really makes Java programming very easy. And I can tell you minus Eclipse programming in Java would be a very frustrating experience, given the verbosity, configuration mess and XML's all over the place. Eclipse these days is advanced enough to really blur the difference between and novice and a expert Java programmers. So by any measure I would say eclipse already does what light table aims to do. The only problem with eclipse is its too heavy, chews a lot of memory and becomes very heavy as things go on.<p>What we expect from light table is really what things like Emacs and Vim already are, plus what they miss. Which is modern GUI candy, easy configuration, availability of packages, stuff like refactoring, bench marking, auto complete and Intellisense easily available out of the box. Along with evolution with modern needs and demands.<p>So that is why what we really needed was an Emacs + all that I mentioned.<p>I think it will be nice if at some point requirements are frozen for Light table. Because things like this really slip into Second systems effect easily.<p>According to me Light Table must be Emacs for the Modern Generation. Anything else, and it won't be impressive. A thin editor, extensible by lisp. All lisp and other Emacs editor goodies but with all the modern demands.<p>We already have enough of other kind of IDE's.",1337702065

Facebook has been aggressively indifferent to this whole process, which involves a lot of complexity both in decision making and communication.  ""Don't make the analysts look bad"" is an important rule, but one that's easy to miss unless you spend some time thinking through your communications with the market.<p>If FB's initial analyst communications emphasized optimism over credibility and deliverability, or FB was impatient with questions casting doubt, the analysts may have had reason to start with high estimates.  The May 9 filing comes out and reveals those to be implausible, and they have to dial back to avoid looking silly or as if they're pumping the stock.<p>If FB management hadn't spent a lot of time thinking about the relationships between the analysts and the investors, they may have missed the point that those investors are the analysts' ultimate clients.  If they didn't spend much time with the analysts, they may have neglected building relationships where they could subtly signal issues without tripping regulatory problems.<p>Or the analysts were idiots and screwed up the biggest assignments of their lives.<p>Is all this shady company / banker / investor communication good?

4008380,comment,4007570,4008124,2,0,JackC,,,"The point is that it's difficult to create a competitive marketplace while also providing a government guarantee that every buyer will find a seller. For example, suppose the government guarantee is ""every high-school graduate with an SAT over X will be able to go to an acceptably good college without prohibitive debt."" That's a reasonable goal we could adopt. Now how does the government fulfill that guarantee?<p>Specifically, suppose we create a marketplace of for-profit education sellers as you suggest, and that marketplace creates good-enough-cheap-enough* slots for 80% of eligible students. What happens to the remaining 20% of students? In an ordinary marketplace, that demand would go unfilled, creating an incentive for more good-enough-cheap-enough slots to be created (up to some equilibrium, not necessarily enough for everyone). But we can't let ""demand"" go unfilled in this case (i.e., throw smart poor kids under the bus). So does the government fulfill its guarantee by favoring unacceptable sellers, either paying extra or lowering its standards -- giving sellers who charged less an incentive to raise their prices or provide a worse service? Or does it fulfill the guarantee by re-creating public universities, abandoning the goal of a for-profit marketplace?<p>These aren't rhetorical questions -- we're currently using both strategies, and more. It's not an unsolvable problem, but it's not a trivial one.<p>(Check out the Commonwealth Health Connector to see how Massachusetts is solving the same problem in health care, combining for-profit providers with a universal guarantee. They're not doing a bad job, but it sure ain't a conventional free market.)<p>* And then there's the question of what's good enough and cheap enough, when it's a democratic/lobbying process setting standards -- that's pretty different from an ordinary marketplace between lots of buyers and sellers.",1337701674

Lots of performance/watt to gain there, if there's no alternative.<p>Plus people making the hardware and software of phones and laptops need to sell units too, so they'll pick up some of the slack. Not every iPhone is a significant upgrade in terms of performance.<p>And lastly, a whole bunch of chips are being bought for reasons other than the old one is too slow; people are getting multiple computers, more gadgets, and in developing countries people are getting their first computers. Devices are becoming disposable. Laptops die and get replaced, even though even a Pentium M stacks up relatively well these days.<p>20+ years, though, you may have a point.

Yes, nearly all markets are massively manipulated by those with weight, with the Forex markets being one of the least manipulated because those who would like to manipulate them generally don't have the means to do so.<p>The important thing to realize is that markets, manipulated or not, are pain optimization machines. They move in ways that maximize psychological distress to to the greatest number of participants, and this happens for sound fundamental reasons based on human psychology, moment to moment supply and demand, and the way in which most people approach a trade-slash-investment.

One of the earliest reported incidents of air rage involved a passenger in first class, probably trying to take his mind, erm, off cigarettes, by drinking too much, and he was refused another drink, and so he decided to lodge his displeasure, and shat on top of the food trolley.\n""<p>While Patrick Smith may not be an air conditioning expert, as a pilot he's required to know how the AC systems work and how to operate them, and if there was a widespread modification to AC systems or pilot procedures after the smoking ban, I'd expect him to know about it and mention it in the article.",1337701317

The view would quickly become a huge list of functions and code blocks, most of which you probably don't need to see at any given time, and at this point it's no more useful than plain old user-curated tabs.<p>That's just one example. The same conceptual problems pop up for stuff like on-the-fly code execution (what if your code depends on user input or many SQL queries or files that may or may not exist at that point), benchmark mode (benchmarking a complex app is obviously a lot more complicated than just running two code blocks side by side), etc.<p>I know this is just a demo and it's all very early in the process, and I'm not saying that this should be a solved problem yet, but I just can't picture in my head a way that this could ever be a solved problem as long as LightTable remains somewhat similar to its current state.",1337699911

I think we all recognize that appropriate use of technology is a critical component of education now.  It takes money to use technology well; both to buy the hardware and software itself, and to hire people with the expertise to use technology appropriately in schools.<p>Anything that increases the funding gap between rich schools and poor schools contributes to a technology gap as well.  If you think school segregation is a thing of the past in the US, visit a poor urban school.  You  will see schools with 95%-99% minority students.  I know it's related to poverty more than education policy, but the net effect is the same - we have segregated schools.<p>I'm all for people supporting their children's schools directly.  But policies that divert taxpayer money away from public schools and into private schools is ugly policy.",1337699026

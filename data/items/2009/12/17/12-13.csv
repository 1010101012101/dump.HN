Our protagonist works for a ""Conflict Investment"" division, that essentially funds small wars  and revolutions around the world, and they win their contracts by killing the representatives of the competing corporations on the road.<p>Ironically, he's driving a SAAB, which due to market forces probably won't be around for much longer. :-)",1261054691

Compared to the value supposedly lost by the original artists by allowing their work to be remixed, how much does society gain from allowing their work to be remixed?<p>Did the Gray Album devalue the White Album more than it created value?<p>Did the video of the kid dancing to Dragostei Din Tei (aka Numa Numa) devalue the original song more than it created value?  Let us say that it did; what about if we include the additional sales of records that resulted from the popularity of the video?  Was value still lost?  Could we get into a situation where you claim value was lost, yet the original artists would insist that value was gained?",1261054597

This is where you have to create a complete narrative, starting from known and agreed statements and deriving a sequence of statements using agreed deductive principles.<p>The artistry is in finding the <i>why</i> of your theorem, in selecting your path through the infinitely large set of exponentially branching possibilities, and being guided some sense of ""rightness,"" or beauty.<p>I've always (for some definition of ""always"") felt that finding conjectures tends to be a science.  You gather data, you find patterns, you form hypotheses, you make predictions, you test your predictions, you gain confidence, and eventually you state your conjecture.  So far you've been doing science.<p>Then you have to proof your result.  Without an indefinable sense of a guiding ""truth"" you are then lost.  Mechanical manipulations are of little value, you need a sense of where you are going.<p>There is the art.<p>Finally, when you have your proof, you need to give directions, to take others through the steps and thus convince them.

It's too early yet to go after a co-founder since I am not even sure at this point which of my ideas has the biggest potential (if any does at all).<p>Where can I find like minded people that are willing to discuss & brainstorm?<p>PS: I know there are sites for finding a co-founder, but that's not really what I'm trying to do. My approach is to first meet people, brainstorm and eventually become their co-founder.<p>I know this isn't the right place, but in case anyone else is in my situation, you are welcome to add me on msn / email me: olalonde at gmail.com",1261051725

I was only citing the prestige factor as one of the contributing causes.<p>It's a mixture of regulatory corruption and price inelasticity. Prestige is just one of many Manhattan's demand drivers that, due to the inelastic nature of the price curve, drives it up.<p>Regarding school, I think it's both. The question is <i>why</i> these rich people don't want their kids going to school with such people. I think it still comes down to college (and possibly prep high school; nothing before HS matters from a connections perspective) admissions. If college admissions gave as much of an advantage to white, middle-class students of NYC public schools as they do to Andover and Dalton grads, these people would quickly change their strategy.",1357700211

5029832,comment,5028939,5028939,9,0,ojosilva,,,"Hi there. I'm the one you're talking about. I'm always late. You're right. It's a character flaw. But I swear to you, it's the toughest character flaw I've ever dealt with. For some reason, when I'm deeply immersed doing something, I'm incapable of wrapping up whatever it is that I'm tied up doing and fucking leave. It's stronger than willpower. It truly bewilders me. I feel that dealing with my lateness is 100 times worse than dealing with that other time management disorder, procrastination. At least with procrastination I can realize what's going on and help myself out of it. But let me assure you: I don't mean to be rude, and I'm not at all selfish as I consider myself pretty empathetic with your frustration.  And I'm not only late for appointments: I delay eating my meals, falling asleep, going to the bathroom... I guess it's some sort of time-autism: if I'm supposed to be somewhere at 8, only when the clock is about to turn 8 an alarm triggers a switch in my brain (all other alarms are useless) and I get going, with zero chance of making it on time. Like you said, 8 and 8ish\n become the same on a daily basis. At 8, when I snap out of it I'm really angry at myself for losing track of time. How did it happen, I ask myself one time after another. It's sickening how often it happens. It feels like waking up in pajamas in a bus stop and realize you just sleptwalk your way there. Consider it some sort of Tourette's. It's not pleasant to be around me, but I just can't help it, I swear.<p>From what I've been able to observe so far, procrastination precedes my lateness, in a way that one becomes a symptom for the other. Ie. It's morning and I have to do some really important task at work ASAP. Later, at 8pm, I have to meet you for dinner downtown. But I don't start getting work done until way after lunch, having procrastinated all morning surfing HN. So, around 3pm, when my mind finally comes to terms with responsibility, an overwhelming sense of duty takes over me, striking upon the task at hand with great vengeance and furious anger. Concentration is tops and speed is maximum. Code is thorough. Design is sharp. Text is brilliant. Suddenly it's 8 o'clock and, yup, I'm late.\n Time is not standing still anymore.  I feel awful.<p>My theory is that the strength I have to build up on a daily basis so that I can overcome procrastination, sleepiness, attention deficit and mild depression is also responsible for my recurring tardiness. To be able to reach such concentration nirvana, my mind has to shut down everything else on the planet earth. On the other hand, whenever I wake up focused and in a good mood, chances are I'm going to be the one ordering that bottle of Pinot.",1357699514

You have code that depends on resource A but doesn't use resource A on every request; how do you manage something like that manually in a huge project?<p>> Sure, you will have slightly longer interpreting time<p>If you have a large framework almost everything depends on everything else.  So you end up loading and interpreting 100% of your framework on every request.  Even worse, you load it all at the start of the request!  If you code only uses a small fraction, lets say 20%, of the framework and only loads and interprets it on demand that will make a difference.<p>> While I'm all for low-hanging performance fruit, this particular approach ('autoload') costs too much and delivers too little to be generally praiseworthy, whilst harming simplcity.<p>I don't much care about the performance considerations but I find autoloading <i>far</i> simpler than manually specifying every dependency.  In fact, most modern languages don't bother with that either -- going back to C/C++ from Java/C# gives the same sort of pain.

I have never* had to deal with health insurance as a consumer, though I paid insurance claims for five years. My father and ex husband were both career military and are both military retirees. I have been a military dependent my entire life. Given the length of my marriage, as long as I don't remarry, I am entitled to free medical coverage for life.<p>But: I nearly died twelve years ago. I am clear my excellent medical coverage, which helped me get good dental care, helped poison me. I have spent the last twelve years getting well instead of politely dying from my genetic disorder like the world would like me to do. I used to have an extremely good friend in Canada and I am abundantly familiar with the fact that Canadians who live along the border sometimes drive to the U.S. and pay out of pocket in order to get around the sometimes months long waiting lists common in Canada, and there is a complex relationship between the American system and the funding of drug research globally. As I understand it, in general terms, the U.S. takes the brunt of the costs of new drugs and pays crazy high brand name prices for a decade to cover the sunk cost of research and then after we have covered this essential cost, it becomes a generic and is marketed globally at much more reasonable prices. So it is possible that drug research could come to a virtual standstill if the American system changed.<p>Furthermore, military members, military retirees, and government employees operate under a very different system from general civilians. There isn't just one American system. And military service is, from what I gather, far more common in the U.S. than in many other countries.<p>So as I said initially: I am conflicted. I think it is far more complex than most people realize. But having worked for an insurance company, I am inclined to believe that if the world decided ""health insurance"" (edit: of the ""major medical"" variety) was the Darth Vader of our galaxy and should be hunted down and made extinct, most likely the world would be a better place. So I return to my original question: Anyone have any thoughts on <i>how</i> to accomplish that in the U.S.?<p>Thanks for replying and have an upvote.<p>* Except briefly when my husband was a recruiter and we were stationed somewhere without a base, but it was still different from what civilians live with.",1357696863

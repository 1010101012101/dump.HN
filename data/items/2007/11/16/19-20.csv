This sounds an awful lot like the story of NeXt, from making their own custom hardware, to the super advanced software development environment that they eventually tried to sell by itself for other platforms.  Too bad there was no struggling, mainstream company to buy them that they could have then taken over from the inside.<p>2. Half way through, I was thinking, it would be fun to contrast this with ITA as bad and good examples of how to start a Lisp company with a bunch of guys from MIT.  And then he says he works at ITA!  So, lesson is, if you're going to start a Lisp company, don't make Lisp the product, make it your secret weapon.",1195243040

Things that look risky are to be avoided, and a violation of a contract is a major risk.",1195242354

80777,comment,80621,80772,0,0,optimal,,,"What field isn't monotonous, though? IT work is boring, repetitive, and relegated to the back office, cut off from life, the outside world--even sunlight--and the only interesting and creative part of business: the start (though how exciting or fulfilling is it really to be hawking another useless widget or service to someone who most likely doesn't need it?).",1195241607
80776,comment,80461,80725,0,0,mynameishere,,,"If somebody <i>literally</i> believed in a multi-armed, elephant-headed monstrosity up in the clouds granting wishes[1], I would THINK TWICE about him. I reserve the right to THINK TWICE about people who are completely deluded. As an employer, might I still exploit this person's labor? Quite possibly. But you better believe that modern-day medievalists give reason for pause. Most people are only nominally religious, or behave so, which is expected. <p>Sorry for repeating myself, but when I say something that is 100 percent reasonable, I don't really like taking a lot of shit from people.<p><i>ignorant comments, perhaps you should read the Bhagavad-Gita</i><p>The day I read the Bhagavad-Gita or Rama-rama Ding Dong for that matter in order to <i>reduce</i> my ignorance is the day I die.<p><i>which implies suspending scientific, critical judgement</i><p>...which implies stupidity. I know, I know. That's the problem. I don't want people suspending scientific, critial judgement.<p>[1] Or whatever the hell it does--it's not relevant.<p>",1195241523

80774,comment,79982,80284,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, I like the simple approach to web development that web.py offers and the fact that you get to essentially lay out your own directory structure and pretty much create your own framework. But what really attracted me to Pylons is the interactive web based debugger. If you haven't seen it yet you need to give it a try. In ""development"" mode it will give you a page with the actual traceback and you can interactive inspect the stack, check the value of variables or just run arbitrary python, all over the web. Makes debugging a lot easier. ",1195240813
80773,comment,80428,80428,0,0,gscott,,,"I was able to solve one of my holdups using news.yc.  I needed a fair amount of money to buy new servers, get really good co-location service, pay for incorporating, and cover some other expenses.  By posting to news.yc my need and what I thought I could do (will do) I was able to find someone to buy-in a 5% stake of what I am doing.  The news.yc forum is a powerful medium.  In all I found a partner willing to to give me $20,000 (its in my bank now) so I could make things happen.  5% may seem like a lot but I figure I still own 95% and have no need to go out and look for more money.",1195240808
80772,comment,80621,80757,0,0,ibsulon,,,"While similar reasoning ultimately influenced me not to go to law school, tier 1 schools are not overly difficult to get into for someone who has already figured out the game. (A la Paul Graham's infamous essay.)<p>Frankly, the problems of which the post speaks are really all rooted in the same problem: there are too many people graduating from law school already. The competition allows the firms the luxury of such monotonous work.<p>Unfortunately, I wanted something else - I wanted to become an expert at some portion of law and exploit my ability to keep many pieces of a situation in my head. However, the opportunity cost, considering the competition, did not seem to match up with the expected reward.",1195240704
80771,comment,80621,80621,0,0,geebee,,,"This article does a good job explaining why I should stop saying ""how is 100K good for a programmer with an MS when an English major right out of law school earns blah blah blah.""<p>I actually attended a top 5 law school (for one semester) before getting out and going to grad school in engineering instead.  I agree with the statement that ""thinking like a lawyer"" is a bug, not a feature - it wasn't just that I didn't want to be a lawyer - I felt that getting wired like a lawyer would do actual damage to my brain and my character.  <p>I have friends (yes, they genuinely are still friends) who do often exhibit the lawyer tendencies identified in this post, far more often than my engineer and science friends do.  Yes, there's pettiness, bluffing, and intellectual dishonesty in all fields.  But these are traits that are encouraged by the culture of law, and discouraged by the culture of engineering.  \n",1195240599

No matter what you invest at what percent, this one has a lot of proven traction already and is more likely to be a winner than most deals (I think). I think what I'm getting at is the question of: what do you do if the VC model just isn't quite right? It seems everyone assumes there is no business growing with them.<p>Also:\n-theyoungceo isn't naive enough to believe that investors are scouring news.yc for deals, although he'd love to be proven wrong.\n-i didn't mention the company name because i know everyone knows everyone in SV and it might be unprofessional to be discussing this here from an investor's perspective (IMHO)\n",1195239863

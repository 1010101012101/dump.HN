10648788,comment,10642288,10646006,0,0,unfamiliar,,,"The &quot;fancy abstractions&quot; criticism is kind of orthogonal to the performance one.<p>Specific complaints about arrays are the design choice to not include dimensions in the type parameters. It means that simple errors only show up at runtime, sometimes hours into a simulation. The ability to specify not enough/too many indices is also a problem for the same reason.<p>It&#x27;s hard to provide specific examples because a lot of the time I don&#x27;t understand why something is happening. For example,<p><pre><code>    n = 10; [i for i=1:n]\n</code></pre>\ngives an Array{Any,1}, but when I try to figure out why in the interactive prompt,<p><pre><code>    [i for i=1:10]\n</code></pre>\ngives an Array{Int64,1}. In my experience the Any version is slower, and they crop up all over, deep my programs. So I have to manually use<p><pre><code>    n = 10; [i::Int64 for i=1:n]\n</code></pre>\nThe type system is generally quite nice and I like working with it a lot. But none of my colleagues know what it is and don&#x27;t care how it works, they just want to add doubles together. So the fact that things like<p><pre><code>    x = Array(1)\n</code></pre>\ngive error messages like<p><pre><code>    ERROR: MethodError: `convert` has no method matching convert(::Type{Array{T,N}}, ::Int64)\n    This may have arisen from a call to the constructor Array{T,N}(...),\n    since type constructors fall back to convert methods.\n    Closest candidates are:\n      call{T}(::Type{T}, ::Any)\n      convert(::Type{Array{T,N}}, ::SharedArray{T,N})\n      convert{T,N}(::Type{Array{T,N}}, ::AbstractArray{T,N})\n      ...\n     in call at essentials.jl:56\n</code></pre>\nscares the living bejesus out of anyone who wants to simply use arrays without knowledge of types, parametric types, constructors, and the call and convert functions (not to mention that SharedArray and AbstractArray). All of this is too much abstraction for a normal scientist or engineer to want to have to deal with. What the error message really should just say is<p><pre><code>    Missing type parameter in method: Array(<type>, <dimension>)\n</code></pre>\nArrays are implemented as abstract types and now constructors fall back to convert, which is all very clever and fits into the grand type system view, but the result is that the debug information is hugely complicated.<p>As for the performance, I&#x27;ve been trying to implement my own FixedSizeArrays type thing, where arrays have dimensions as type parameters. My code for 1D looks like this:<p><pre><code>    immutable Float1D{nx}\n        data :: Array{Float64,1}\n        Float1D() = new(Array(Float64,nx))\n        function Float1D(xs::Array{Float64,1})\n            size(xs) == (nx,) || error(&quot;Size of initialization array ($(size(xs))) does not match type parameter ($nx)&quot;)\n            new(xs)\n        end\n    end\n    size{nx}(xs::Float1D{nx}) = (nx,)\n    getindex(xs::Float1D, i::Int) = xs.data[i]\n    setindex!(xs::Float1D, v::Real, i::Int) = xs.data[i] = v\n</code></pre>\nAnd it&#x27;s performance is much worse than the native arrays. I don&#x27;t know why, since the methods seem simple enough to inline, but I&#x27;m sure there is a lot I&#x27;m missing. I think maybe it is partly because the Julia Array type and its methods seem to be implemented in C. Either way, having thought about this a lot and understand the compiler and type system reasonably well (for an end user) I still don&#x27;t know how to get it to go faster. I think that is unreasonably complex for people who just want code to work fast.",1448881134
10648787,comment,10644690,10647443,0,0,coldtea,,,"Because people complaining is not necessarily correlated to product quality. Some people will always complain (in general), others will lament the changing of favorite features (while others liking the new functionality more), and a number will always have legitimate issues.<p>Is there anything to show that those &quot;legitimate issues&quot; are of graver importance and more damaging than those complained about in the past? I&#x27;ve not seen anything to justify that. It&#x27;s mostly people not liking X or Y UI change -- meanwhile the platform has record sales, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to have lowered its reach and popularity.<p>When people really get into the changes, like in John Siracusa&#x27;s reviews, the story is different. While they might complain about this or that change, the overall verdict is positive for newer versions, especially including the non-UI layer changes (kernel behavior, new APIs, etc).",1448881072

10648776,comment,10648449,10648449,0,0,Dwolb,,,"I spent some time this summer learning about some of these issues if anyone would like a little context about the Philippines.<p>Remittances are a way for overseas foreign workers (OFWs, think jobs like maids in Saudi Arabia) to send money back home to their families.  This is typically (but not exclusively) the mother of the household who sends money back to the father and children for things like food and school tuition. It&#x27;s not uncommon for this money to be squandered by those back home (i.e. used on material possessions or vices instead of education)<p>Most remittance money flows through pawn shops who have come to act like small banks for the unbanked.  This works because low income people are typically high risk lendees. So, pawn shops take physical collateral against any cash loans. Naturally, these pawn shops got so good at making lending decisions and moving hard cash around the provinces (low income areas), they&#x27;ve effectively become the standard for low-income cash solutions.<p>Coins.ph effectively is throwing their hat in the ring to compete against pawn shops and payment providers, creating competition in the cash market which will (hopefully) increase distribution and lending transparency and decrease fees (Philipino payment settlement is very fragmented).<p>My own opinion is Coins.ph is a really good idea for small retail solutions, but not for P2P lending. The reason is crime is a huge issue in the Philippines and Coins.ph is essentially a map of people who would be able to be robbed if they carried substantial amounts of cash. Contrast this to small retail outlets who can now be enabled to lend cash to customers using already-established cash-handling processes.<p>I feel there would have to be substantial differences in norms put in place to allow for actual P2P lending. i.e. stringent identity controls and social features which de-risk the transaction for the lending party.",1448880788

In this study, we aimed to determine whether bilingualism also influences cognitive outcome after stroke.<p>Methods—We examined 608 patients with ischemic stroke from a large stroke registry and studied the role of bilingualism in predicting poststroke cognitive impairment in the absence of dementia.<p>Results—A larger proportion of bilinguals had normal cognition compared with monolinguals (40.5% versus 19.6%;\nP<0.0001), whereas the reverse was noted in patients with cognitive impairment, including vascular dementia and\nvascular mild cognitive impairment (monolinguals 77.7% versus bilinguals 49.0%; P<0.0009). There were no differences in the frequency of aphasia (monolinguals 11.8% versus bilinguals 10.5%; P=0.354). Bilingualism was found to be an independent predictor of poststroke cognitive impairment.<p>Conclusions—Our results suggest that bilingualism leads to a better cognitive outcome after stroke, possibly by enhancing cognitive reserve.

Lets see, if the number of recharging cycles will really be twice as large (2000 instead of 1000). That would eat into the revenue, unless the new batteries were sold for a higher price (which in turn would give them trouble to compete against Lithium).<p>The main revolution is not a technical one, it is the fact that a big market may move from Asia to Europe.<p>If a capacity increase or a weight decrease could be realised, I&#x27;d accept the term &#x27;revolution&#x27;.",1448878064

This alone makes Lithium more competitive by weight in the long run.<p>The ideal battery consists of two electrodes where one consists purely of the alkali metal in the charged state and the other one is weightless at the charged state but then collects the metal oxide when discharging. The oxygen is ideally taken from the air.<p>Currently we are far from that ideal since the electrodes contain additional matrix materials, between the electrodes an electrolyte is present, the oxidizing agent is stored inside the battery requiring yet other chemicals to keep it stable. Then the battery needs a casing which adds more weight.",1448877858

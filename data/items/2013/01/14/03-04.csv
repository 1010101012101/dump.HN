If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed by accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked, or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter -- we never need read of another. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all news, as it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea.""",1358135950

5053196,comment,5052022,5052022,15,0,mpyne,,,"Although I am deeply saddened by Aaron taking his life, I feel that part of the article is intellectually dishonest.<p>I.e., it recites synopses of the charges and then states that the charges are not true because:<p>- ""MIT runs an open network"" But this is irrelevant, if Aaron used my public Wifi it wouldn't be my job to police his actions even if I had the resources for that.<p>- ""MIT could have locked the network down, but didn't."" This is a poor excuse as well. ""I could have locked my car doors, but I didn't, so I guess it's my fault."" Or better yet, ""I could have worn my hijab, but I didn't, so I suppose it's my fault I was punished in a Sharia court"".<p>- ""MIT doesn't specifically tell its users not to do dickwad things to its network."" This is the same logic that gets those ""stupid warning labels"" put on everything!<p>- ""JSTOR didn't have technical facilities in place to stop people like Aaron."" But the only reason such technical facilities would be needed is if Aaron's behavior on the network were unacceptable in the first place.<p>- ""Aaron did not 'hack' the JSTOR website for all reasonable definitions of 'hack'"". But this is kind of a strawman, go back and read the article's own description of the charges if you don't believe me, they claim only generic things like ""unauthorized access"" or ""deceptively appearing as if he were from MIT"".<p>- ""He didn't try to hide his behavior"". Who CARES? If I steal something in broad daylight in the real world people would say I was an idiot, not that I was ""innocent"".<p>- ""Other people use fake identities too"". Which is the same argument every parent of a 5-year-old has heard and taken care of...<p>- ""If JSTOR had properly responded to the DoS/unauthorized access it wouldn't have been such a big deal"". See above about victim blaming.<p>- ""But he wasn't trespassing!"". And in the next sentence, ""the Federal government isn't charging him with such"". Uh, OK?<p>Now, did he deserve even the possibility of 35 years in prison? No. Is it right to prevent him (as Lessig claims) from forming a proper legal defense fund? Absolutely not.<p>In fact, <i>that</i> would be an area that needs to be properly ""witch hunted"" over because it's obvious from the outpouring of support now that Aaron's dead that he could have found help if he were able to ask... so why wasn't he able? What did the district court judge order that led Aaron to kill himself rather than risking the ire of a district judge?<p>I wonder also why Aaron was so worried about being termed a 'felon'. I've worked with a felon, it was a similarly stupid charge (let's just say he later married his ""victim""), and absolutely no one cared. Roman Polanski is still making movies; Aaron would have been just fine. But that was his choice to make. :(<p>But I worry about articles like this that have popped up in the aftermath, especially when they are so full of inaccuracies as this.",1358135263

In college I got to the point where 2 30-90 minute sessions daily was the norm.<p>I then tried to quit again. I went 5 days, and then 4 days, and then gave up on the idea, resigning myself to immense sexual activity. Every month or so, I'll go on a complete rampage with as many as 10 orgasms a day for 2-3 days, rarely coming out of my room. Sometimes it even interferes with food.<p>My sexual tastes have grown increasingly complex, sometimes illegal, sometimes not outwardly sexual at all (example, the thought of loneliness in a girl). It has changed how I look at nearly everything, but I'm not ready to conclude that it has been for the worse.<p>I had sex for the first time this week. I didn't climax. My parter had no issues but I was completely uninterested, which is interesting because I had been looking forward (greatly) to the encounter for more than a week. But when it finally happened... complete disinterest. I did my best to think of porn and at least play along, but part of me felt that was more rude than just failing to climax so I sat back and let my partner enjoy her share.  ED was no issue.<p>It's worth adding that I had never met the girl before, seen pics and talked via phone but never met in person. I had little (if any) emotional attraction to the girl, and for this reason specifically I'm not very worried. It just caught my attention because I would never have guessed that a 19yo boy would go through 40 minutes of sex with an attractive girl and not climax.<p>Since then I've been more motivated to quit, but I'm still not ready to conclude that porn has been a negative or bad experience. It has consistently given me a lot to think about, especially watching my interests and needs shift over the past few years.

Compassion isn't the same thing as knowledge, any more then thinking programming is cool is the same thing as understanding Hoffman coding.<p>This is a rare topic that my bachelor's degree in psychology can maybe help me answer on HN.  The sort of thing you are talking about is something that the practice of community psychology addresses.<p>Incidentally, when I say you hereafter, I mean people interested in working towards dealing with the issues you raise, including stakeholders.<p>There is nothing wrong with exploring the idea of helping depressed hackers. Let me get that out of the way.<p>But you don't necessarily know the best way to help.  And you don't want to dictate what is best, without understanding things from different perspectives. And you don't want to be treating the individuals if there are broader root causes or issues.<p>Community psychology would suggest you should consult multiple stakeholders, and build for the community in an iterative way, using empirical data to develop best practices.  Just like A/B testing for your website change, you want to know if you are helping things get better, and by how much, and how you can optimize even more.<p>So, multiple stakeholders...\nStakeholders include: \ndepressed hackers, \nfamilies of depressed hackers, \nfriends of depressed hackers,\npeople willing to offer support/money/time,\ntherapists and other mental health professionals,\ncompanies employing/funding hackers.<p>Possibly insurance companies and local hacker groups.<p>All the above can be involved, can help, or hinder, have resources, and desires.<p>You also need to step back and think hard about what you see the issue. The problem you think you want to solve needs to be touched on by those stakeholders, as well as seeing what resources can be offered.  To some extent the solution should fit the resources, but it's also important that the solution fit the problem.<p>You need to make sure you are solving the issue at the right level.  Are there systemic causes, or barriers to help, that go beyond a single individual? Who can help change those, if they exist.<p>You can try to help the individual deal with their environment, but that's just first order change.  It may be more helpful to change their environment.  Instead of addressing people when they are hurting the worst, can we prevent some of the harm they experience so they hurt less?<p>Like if there is a stigma associated with mental health issues, addressing that with education could help people get treatment.  If the pressure to produce code and work long hours makes increases anxiety and depression, that can be addressed as well.<p>There also may be regional differences.  I believe the UK has national mental health care coverage, right?  The U.S. doesn't sadly.<p>My point being, don't just think about helping a person cope with how things are.  Think about how we might change how things are so it's easier for such people to cope.<p>Anyway, I hope that's helpful in your process.  I want to encourage you.  Go ahead, try something. Maybe start a discussion site or mailing list on the topic. Start small and prepare to shift your understanding and focus more then one time.",1358133653

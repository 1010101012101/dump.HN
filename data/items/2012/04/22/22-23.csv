3876444,comment,3875729,3875729,52,0,michaelochurch,,,"OP's story is unfortunate, but this is tame compared to some of the things I've seen or heard of in the past five years. If this is TC-worthy, I've seen enough dirt to fertilize the Sahara.<p>This is a case of company and person who didn't work out, but it doesn't leave me feeling that Microsoft was unethical or mean-spirited about it (which is more than I can say of many, many companies). Badly run, sure, but not evil. Microsoft offered him a severance, and they gave him ample warning. Besides, if the company (or, at least, the part of it into which he landed) was that bad, why'd he stick around for so many years?<p><i>Why look for work elsewhere when I could coast from meeting to meeting, uttering and typing meaningless busywork. I could not relinquish that kind of comfort.</i><p>I may be unusual, but I get nervous and antsy in this kind of ""comfort"". It just makes me feel like no one is getting anything done and disaster is coming. Also, experience has led me to conclude that when the group is underperforming, the ""rebel"" rather than the cause of the underperformance is the one to get smited, utterly regardless of individual performance. So, environments where nothing is getting done scare me. Even if <i>I</i> am individually doing great, there's going to be blame to be allocated, and the fact that I'm individually an asset to the team is no shield.<p>In my mind, working itself is fun. Even when difficult and frustrating, actual <i>work</i> is not stressful, except in very rare moments of crisis. Those interminable sitting-down ""stand up"" (do people not know what the fucking words mean?) meetings that many companies have, on the other hand... fucking intolerable. I would not be ""comfortable"" if my calendar had 5 hours per day of status meetings and pointless chatter on it. I'd go insane.<p><i>My planned and promised promotion was cancelled.</i><p>That should have launched a thousand resumes. Or at least five or six. Why delay in getting ready? As OP has learned, they won't. Corporate ""loyalty"" is dead. Just don't ""job hop"" if you chance upon the one company in 20 that actually treats its employees decently and knows what it is doing... because, unless you know where you're going and trust the people you'll be working with, you probably won't find another. Job hopping is only stupid/dodgy when you leave a <i>good</i> company for a pay raise.<p><i>Official HR warnings were sent.</i><p>Anyone who is not looking for another job after the first ""official"" warning is sent is a fucking moron. It doesn't even have to come from HR. Negative <i>verbal</i> feedback from the boss might be genuine constructive criticism. He might be trying to groom you into a leader. Negative <i>written</i> feedback, such as an email? That is <i>not</i> ever to your advantage. If your boss is genuinely trying to improve you or groom you for something better, all such feedback will be verbal. Hostile email? Then get the fuck out. The case is being built.<p>For the record, PIPs (which is what the ""dubious case"" sounds like) are a kangaroo court and they can be emotionally draining. The trick is to recognize what they are and <i>not</i> get emotionally drained. (The reason to avoid emotional drain is <i>not</i> to save your current job; that's over. It's to do well in your transition and next job.) Don't get emotional. It's just a damn game, and the only way to win is to get out. Forget the shitty sweet talk. This manager doesn't want to ""improve"" you. He wants to get rid of you. Your job is to leave on your own terms before you get fired-- or, if that can't be done for some reason, engage in the legalistic fighting but realize that the best-case scenario is for the PIP to be ruled ""inconclusive"" and, unless you can transfer after that, have the manager PIP you again. Almost no one ever passes a PIP. Most people leave; the rest either get fired or the PIP is ruled ""inconclusive"".<p><i>I was offered 12-weeks pay for an amicable departure.</i><p>Take it. More than enough time to get another job.<p><i>Instead I decided to escalate the thoughts above to the highest echelons of Microsoft.</i><p>Terrible move. Like, Ned Stark in Game of Thrones. Managers and executives are fundamentally <i>tribal</i>. Most of them will protect their own, at any ethical or business cost except their own skin. If you go against one manager in front of another, your credibility is shark-shit at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.<p>Likewise, never threaten to leave a job over managerial misbehavior. You'll just get fired. You don't threaten to get another job (unless you've found one and are trying for severance). Just get another job.",1335135584

3876438,comment,3875729,3876306,10,0,ryanmolden,,,"Yeah, there is definitely a balance to strike between just venting your spleen and calling out real douchebaggery. I have always suspected the ""never talk about being screwed over/speak ill of a previous employer"" meme is strikingly similar to the kind of meme sociopaths would want to become ""the norm"". Absent anyone talking about their experiences (good or bad) there would really be much less downside for terrible behavior, since no one would ever mention it so the offenders could just continue on mistreating people with impunity, of course as I said, balance is called for and not all situations are really so one-sided.

Also average income I would imagine doesn't take into account healthcare costs which can run thousands.

3876434,comment,3874324,3875246,1,0,dirtyaura,,,"I agree that code with too small functions can be hard to understand, especially if the naming of functions is not top notch. And naming things is one of the hardest parts of programming. Ability to give good names requires thorough understanding of concepts involved, which often isn't true the first time (or even second time) you write the code.<p>There's also interesting discussion about ""optimal"" function length in Steve McConnell's Code Complete. If I recall correctly, there was no evidence that functions of even 100 LoCs for complex algorithms were significantly more error prone than similar code with shorter functions, and that very short functions actually lead to more bugs than code with functions with reasonable length. I think it is because of naming: it's hard to name hundreds of small things well.",1335135426

Tor is going fairly strongly, Retroshare has recently gotten a big uptake in publicity, and some other darknet projects have been floated.

You could add that sort of functionality to C, but it's not going to be as nice as just using C++.  A lot of the things which make Erlang ugly are safe guards that prevent the kinds of bugs that allow you to accidentally share state.  For instance, if I send a pointer between distributed systems, my program is hosed.  Any distributed C++ library is going to either be extremely limited in the kinds of objects it can send or, more likely, just declare via fiat that it's the programmers responsibility not to send anything with a pointer.  That's okay until the moment that you import a third party library and you have to go through every object to make sure that it doesn't use a pointer somewhere as a private variable.  Meanwhile, with Erlang, there aren't any pointers, so I never even have to think about this stuff.",1335134953

Now, Google seem ruthless in their hunt for your information and this alone should be enough to make a decision. But it's a bigger problem than just that: you are at their mercy for any change they introduce, and they are a critical component of the internet for many if not most of us. Namely this interface change, or the availability of that simple html option. One could argue that the same can be said for any ""cloud service"" but email is typically a bit too critical to many of us. It definitely is for me. And they would push their integration plans whatever your opinion is and whatever the consensus is. This <i>modus operandi</i> seems to be the new standard at Google.<p>The last straw was a recent incident I had with my Android phone. So apparently in one of the recent updates of Google Talk they realised they could just log me into their one-and-only Google Account with gmail, etc. included. I had very carefully avoided Gmail's app (which they won't let you delete). I had refused to ""sync"" anything or add my Google account. Now, Google wouldn't let me log-out or delete my account.<p>I don't have any particularly compromising information in my phone. I don't have any ""secret"" numbers and the labels make sense just to me. I have it set up so if I lost it, it wouldn't be a big problem. But now I had my email forcibly open in my phone for anyone to see. Now I had to lock the screen and be extra-careful. Google doesn't let you delete your account from the phone easily. They provide this ""option"" but if you click on it they will let you know that you can only delete your account from the phone by doing a factory reset. Goodbye installed apps, settings, highscores, everything. So I did, and proceeded to create an account just for the phone.<p>Now, searches are getting painfully slow and they're quite poor compared to Thunderbird. But I'd still prefer gmail for the convenience of having it always available and always synced from anywhere, if only they weren't so insisting in upping their stakes and in forcing people into an all-or-nothing situation. I bet it makes business sense for them, it just doesn't make it for me.<p>I lost my youtube account when they stopped allowing independent accounts (had it locked to someone else's Google account and couldn't get this person to release it). I cannot afford to risk losing my main email account, so I'm taking preventive action while they still allow a relatively easy migration back to the desktop.",1335134362

For instance, I am considering a service at the moment which would involve people uploading confidential information. The uploads will be fairly large, so a lot of bandwidth will be required (optimistically assuming it gets traction.) One architecture I am considering is a small dedicated HTTPS server which provides a self-contained webpage-plus-JS program to encrypt the upload and send it for storage on Amazon S3. Then I will pull the results off Amazon and decrypt them on a machine which is not even connected to the network. The advantage to this architecture is that it will scale arbitrarily but require me to secure only relatively modest dedicated resources, despite being used for transmission of confidential information. Because it uses a dedicated HTTPS server serving a self-contained page doing all the crypto, it avoids tptacek's objections to JS crypto in the browser (E.g., the server can provide the random seed in the JS itself, HTTPS prevents MITM attacks, etc.)<p>(Copied from <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3872007"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3872007</a>)",1335133950

Additionally, following entering the light we have no way of knowing what time-frame this occurred in; how do we know this occurred when she was recorded as having no brain activity.<p>I find myself flopping between the two camps in a Devil's advocate manner - the evidence really isn't strong on either side. There seems to be many questions raised by NDE's, but seeing as we don't even have a firm grasp on what consciousness is, or where it comes from, to suddenly say ""NDE's prove an afterlife, we can maintain consciousness when we're dead"" is a very tenuous claim.<p>Until we can say ""This is consciousness, this is where it comes from, this is what we believe to be the main contributors"" to make a leap of this magnitude concerning a topic we know little about is simply irresponsible.",1335132129

Michigan has had a Center for Entrepreneurship for I believe roughly 8 years now. They've just partnered with the business school to start a Masters in Entrepreneurship in addition to the certificate program they currently have. They also have many other services such as a mentor network for people working on or looking to start a startup as well as TechArb which provide student startups with office space. And all these services are of course free as a student. I'd definitive encourage you to check them out.",1335132092

For instance to send a message to another actor, whether they are on you machine or a remote machine you just need a PID (process identifier, an Erlang id concept similar to, but not the same as an OS level PID). In C++ you would either need to deal with local/remote differences in message transport (ignoring the non-trivial nature of serializing arbitrary types in C++) or create an abstraction that would do so on your behalf. Second, in Erlang all actors have their own heaps, so their local data is spatially close in memory by definition making actors NUMA/cache friendly (assuming the runtime is ""doing it right"") heap allocated data passed between actors in C++ wouldn't have that attribute by default (again, you could make it so with some effort, but it certainly isn't free). Third actors in Erlang don't use full OS level threads, so the overhead of spawning say 10k of them is not the overhead of spawning 10k C++ threads (also ignoring that C++ really only acknowledged the existence of threads in C++11). These are a few issues/benefits, but as I said you could do all of this in any language mostly, but in Erlang a lot of the gross/tricky details are already handled for you.",1335132053

We have some more specific ideas about specific features and advantages, but since we have almost no code yet I won't get into them. We should (since this is actually for school, we <i>have</i> to) have a working prototype several weeks from now, so I'll talk more about it then.<p>We're not really fixing ""version control"" <i>per se</i>; rather, we're building a tool that you could use in tandem with existing systems like Git. So we'll help with diffs, interactive merges (maybe even automatic conflict resolutions) and some other stuff but let the actual storage and versioning stay with Git (or any other VCS).<p>I can't make any promises, but if we get something interesting working I'll be sure to post it here. We actually tried to do something like this for a hackathon once, and it sort of worked, but was really a big hack throughout. Hopefully we'll get it right this time.",1335132011

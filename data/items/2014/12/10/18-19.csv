8730925,comment,8724727,8729594,0,0,kbenson,,,"You picked an extremely good built-in as an example.  It doesn&#x27;t function exactly as you&#x27;ve shown it, but there is very weird stuff going on.  On the plus side, this is the only time I&#x27;ve seen something quite like this in Perl, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s represents the state of using Perl as a whole very well.<p>glob appears to do something special, and unlike most other Perl functions where it&#x27;s just a matter of knowing the context and the API the function exposes.  In the versions I just tested (including 5.21.6), glob in fact doesn&#x27;t quite do what it&#x27;s documentation says, in the apparent effort to &quot;do what you mean&quot;.  It does not iterate through files in the result when used in scalar context, it iterates through files in the result when used in scalar context and in the exact same call-site in the program.<p>Here&#x27;s all the files we&#x27;ll test<p><pre><code>    # perl -E &#x27;my @files = glob(&quot;*&quot;); say for @files;\n    one.a\n    one.b\n    two.a\n    two.b\n</code></pre>\nGlob acts like an iterator when used in scalar context.  Here, each call returns another file.<p><pre><code>    # perl -E &#x27;while ( my $file = glob(&quot;*&quot;) ) { say $file; } &#x27;\n    one.a\n    one.b\n    two.a\n    two.b\n</code></pre>\nGlob gives the first file each time it&#x27;s called in scalar context if it&#x27;s not the same exact point in the source.  This doesn&#x27;t follow the docs, which says it will act like an iterator in scalar context.<p><pre><code>    # perl -E &#x27;my $file1 = glob(&quot;*&quot;); my $file2 = glob(&quot;*&quot;); say $file1; say $file2;&#x27;\n    one.a\n    one.a\n</code></pre>\nAgain, we see it&#x27;s not acting like an iterator.  Each call is generating it&#x27;s own list and returning the first file.<p><pre><code>    # perl -E &#x27;my $file1 = glob(&quot;*&quot;); my $file2 = glob(&quot;two*&quot;); say $file1; say $file2;&#x27;\n    one.a\n    two.a\n</code></pre>\nHere, we can see that since the same point in the code is getting hit, glob is acting like an iterator.<p><pre><code>    # perl -E &#x27;sub myglob { my $mask = shift; glob($mask); } my $file1 = myglob(&quot;*&quot;); my $file2 = myglob(&quot;*&quot;); say $file1; say $file2;&#x27;\n    one.a\n    one.b\n</code></pre>\nHere we see that since the same point in code is getting hit, glob is ignoring it&#x27;s input and just acting like an iterator on the first input, which seems to be what you were trying to show in your example.<p><pre><code>    # perl -E &#x27;sub myglob { my $mask = shift; glob($mask); } my $file1 = myglob(&quot;*&quot;); my $file2 = myglob(&quot;two*&quot;); say $file1; say $file2;&#x27;\n    one.a\n    one.b\n</code></pre>\nThat is very weird behavior.  I agree it&#x27;s not consistent with the rest of the language.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s indicative of the language as a whole though, as it appears to be due to weird historical implementation details that are kept for backwards compatibility.  The perldoc for glob says it&#x27;s implemented using the the standard File::Glob module.  The perldoc for File::Glob mentions that it implements the code glob in terms of bsd_glob (the FreeBSD glob(3) routine, a superset of POSIX glob), which is function that can also be exported.  In fact, the bsd_glob function, when used, acts as we would wish, without weird iterator behavior (without iterator behavior at all, in fact).<p><pre><code>    # perl -E &#x27;use File::Glob qw/:bsd_glob/; my $file1 = bsd_glob(&quot;*&quot;); my $file2 = bsd_glob(&quot;two*&quot;); say $file1; say $file2;&#x27;\n    two.b\n    two.b\n    # perl -E &#x27;use File::Glob qw/:bsd_glob/; sub myglob { my $mask = shift; bsd_glob($mask); } my $file1 = myglob(&quot;*&quot;); my $file2 = myglob(&quot;one*&quot;); say $file1; say $file2;&#x27;\n    two.b\n    one.b\n</code></pre>\nOf course, this means the documentation that says the core glob routine is implemented using bsd_glob has some glaring omissions.<p>So, congratulations, you picked an extremely good example and unearthed some crazy Perl arcana, and possibly a bug (there&#x27;s some open, longstanding tickets regarding glob bugs[1][2], which seem to boil down to &quot;we&#x27;re doing what we can to make it better, but we&#x27;re hampered by backwards compatibility and weird semantics&quot;).  I think the documentation is woefully inadequate to explain what&#x27;s going on in this case though.<p>Note: that bsd_glob seems to return the last item when used in scalar context, not the first.<p><pre><code>  [1]: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2707\n\n  [2]: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2713</code></pre>",1418237791

8730915,comment,8727947,8729605,0,0,e3xu,,,"I agree with you for the most part, but I want to comment on the last phrase you use: &quot;If they are bad laws, then we can work to change them. No amount of VC funding should make you immune to their reach.&quot; I need to direct you to what happened to Aereo, whose business was destroyed by a Supreme Court ruling [0]. The legal system is one area where innovation is slow, and progress is reliant on inefficient mechanics like politics, bureaucracy, precedent, prosecutorial discretion, judicial opinion, and others. This is by design. Compare for a moment a courtroom of the 1950s and 2014, versus a computer of the 1950s and 2014. Our ability to update our regulatory mechanisms has not kept pace with our ability to create new ideas that need regulation.<p>My biggest gripe is perhaps not even the inefficiency of the system, but its natural tendency towards systematic support of entrenched players, see the kind of regulatory capture performed by Comcast, or the article about the Chase Whistleblower from a few weeks back. You say that no amount of VC money should make an individual institution immune to the law, but this sort of immunity is conferred all the time by anyone with deep enough pockets, through mechanisms like lobbyists, regulatory capture and the various campaign finance loopholes exploited by Super-PACs. See any of Lawrence Lessig&#x27;s writings of the past few years for more discussion. I&#x27;m reminded of an article that showed up on Hacker News about the downsides of an economy with a lot of entrenched players (permit me to suggest the &quot;cartel&quot; nomenclature) taking advantage of their favorable position in overly-bureaucratic systems:\n<a href=""http://intellectual-detox.com/2013/04/14/rent-seeking-economy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intellectual-detox.com/2013/04/14/rent-seeking-econom...</a><p>I do agree that Uber&#x27;s shady business practices are not laudable, and there are certain important regulatory functions that can only be performed by unbiased parties interested in the public good, of which the legal system/government ought to be the exemplary case. But I think your suggestion that we can simply work to change bad laws is perhaps dependent on a system that currently cannot consistently keep up with the pace of change, not just because of inefficiency but because of perverse incentives (here is where I could begin to talk about the influence of corporate money in politics). I suspect we will have to wait at least another half-generation before a critical mass of individuals with both a true understanding of the exponential pace of progress and well-credentialed clout can begin to make serious reforms and updates in that area.<p>Until then, &quot;move fast and break things&quot; may, terrifyingly, be our best option.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7943976"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7943976</a>",1418237696

The example is the series of steps and physical mode changes to change f(foo) to f(bar).<p>To do this one must select the letters foo somehow and then cause bar to be typed in their place. This can be done a number of ways in a &quot;normal&quot; text editor. For example, the person might double-click foo with the mouse to select the word and then type in bar. This does four things: 1. places the cursor in the location of foo; 2. select foo; 3. remove foo; 4. insert bar. In this example, there is one or two physical input context changes: from keyboard to mouse and back or maybe just from mouse to keyboard.<p>In vim, the physical input context never changes. The keyboard remains your context throughout. The person would 1. Position the cursor somewhere by foo (i.e. by typing a search expression like /foo<enter>); 2. type ci(<enter> which selects everything in the parenthesis, deletes and changes the context to input; 3. type bar (and probably 4. press the <esc> key).<p>I suspect that some people aren&#x27;t bugged very much by the physical context switch and so the point of this is lost.

In 14 months of working there full time, I&#x27;ve managed to take 6 vacation days, and that&#x27;s more than what most of the dev team got.<p>Then again, that&#x27;s what you sign up for when you work for a startup with a culture that values time at work above pretty much everything else.  The only dev who got a real promotion in that time was the guy who pulls 10 or 11-hour days every day, to prove his &#x27;dedication&#x27; to the company.  And no, he hasn&#x27;t taken any vacation either.",1418236816

You&#x27;ve given a couple of good examples where the answer is government: banking is highly regulated, so breaking into the industry is tough, and the big U.S. auto companies actually would have gone out of business and been replaced without a bailout.<p>But if increasing vacation time makes your employees happier and you also get more productive work out of them, why don&#x27;t the companies that switch then get all of the best employees and eat the lunch of everyone else?

I&#x27;m not sure the existing tools are well suited to them (yet).&quot;</i><p>Certain writers do. It just depends on the domain. For book writers, there are tools like Scrivener. For screenwriters, there are tools like Final Draft. These tools help tremendously with auto-formatting and version control. They also keep track of things like characters and settings, presumably by assigning them to certain classes and IDs &quot;under the hood.&quot; (I&#x27;ve never looked under the hood, but I assume they are XML-based.) They are fantastic tools for the writers they&#x27;re made for. They&#x27;re also fairly WSIWYG, and do not require writers to know anything about markup languages. That&#x27;s pretty key, because many writers are not technically proficient. (Modest technical proficiency, at the very least with HTML and some CSS, is probably going to become a requirement in the future...but I digress.)<p>For journalism, however, Word is the default—and obviously, it has its strengths and its weaknesses. Wonky changelogs and substandard version control are two of the biggest. Some editors at some publications are moving over to Google docs, for the superior versioning and collaboration capabilities. But Google&#x27;s editor doesn&#x27;t offer the robustness and feature set of Word, and it&#x27;s unfamiliar, so a lot of editors and writers are reluctant to adopt it. Personally speaking, I much prefer Google to Word when it comes to working with my editors.

8730764,comment,8729225,8730220,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Not really (see below). The article confuses a number of things and assumes only the simplest or most naive implementations.<p>A graph database is essentially a relational implementation that supports <i>recursive joins</i>. While not part of the strictest, most minimalist relational implementation in theory, most mature SQL databases support this to some extent. Some databases that support recursive joins will limit you to directed acyclic graphs.<p>A document database is a relational database implemented around <i>materialized joins</i>. It saves you from doing common joins dynamically. This is more restricted than a graph because it is a directed acyclic graph only. Again, most mature SQL databases support this to some extent or another.<p>A relational database that supports both materialized and recursive joins has the same expressiveness as a document and/or graph database. However, it trades some query performance in those individual cases for flexibility and performance in other cases that both document and graph databases are relatively poor at. Document and graph databases have existed since databases were first invented. Most of the implementation optimizations for documents and graphs are optionally available in good SQL databasess.<p>Key-value databases are a different beast. Most people only consider primitive databases based on key equality relationships or ordered ranges, which are quite limited. You can also build them based on multidimensional spatial relationships (i.e. keys are hyper-rectangles that can be relatively addressed), which are equivalent in expressiveness to relational implementations. If you added recursive joins to implementations of the spatial variants, you&#x27;d again have something that could express all of the models mentioned.<p>In summary, these models are APIs, they are not fundamentally different things if the underlying database engine is adequate for the purpose. It is why, for example, PostgreSQL can be used quite effectively these days as a document database.",1418236109

To get a sense of this, try using gdb/lldb on code compiled at -O3 with -g turned on so that you still have debugging symbols. Things are weird. When debugging AOT compiled code, one avoids this confusing experience by recompiling the entire program in debug mode with optimizations off. In a JIT environment, what do you do?

I can&#x27;t even opt out of this.<p>This seems totally broken, especially since you are not technically supposed to take other breaks without signing out of work. As someone using the Pomodoro Technique I just don&#x27;t fit into the system.

Furthermore, you can prefix the term &quot;union type&quot; with stuff like &quot;closed/open&quot; and &quot;tagged/untagged&quot; to start making finer grained distinctions as need higher degrees of precision. In Elm it is always tagged and closed, so in discussions within the community, adding those prefixes is redundant. Finally, if you start with the term &quot;union type&quot; it becomes easier to think about what an &quot;anonymous union type&quot; might look like (like OCaml&#x27;s polymorphic variants or open variants) ;)<p>More broadly, if people do run into the term &quot;union type&quot; in other languages they will be building intuition in exactly the way I&#x27;d like: it&#x27;s a way to use different types in the same place. Things happen to have this extra tag thing in Elm, but it&#x27;s not so different than anything people do in JS or Clojure or Racket or TypeScript or C or whatever else. I think bringing that connection out is a major benefit of this naming choice. The goal is to feel really welcoming and friendly, and my personal preference is to build on people&#x27;s existing intuition as much as possible. If someone comes from JS and does not see all the subtleties of this discussion immediately on day one, they are actually having a better experience because they can learn the info as it becomes relevant to their daily usage. Hopefully a much nicer learning curve!<p>I realize I am making a somewhat controversial choice, but the idea is that statically typed FP people are building artificial barriers by being sticklers about this, rather than just prefixing for precision.

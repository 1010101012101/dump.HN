This simply turns the attack against itself: The police-state's strategy relies on: 1. announcing their next target; and 2. keeping that promise. The resistance exploits and completely negates that. To defeat that counter, the attack must disable itself.<p>The critical assumption behind the police-state's strategy is that the resistance is powerless, that they have no ability to respond. But there is enough evidence this would be foolish in the internet world.

Assumptions that can not be made here and there by individual app developers. For example, coalescing DOM updates and drawing events on the run loop. Combining timers together to minimize overhead.

And I'm definitely not red/green blind.<p>If you're thinking about colour impairments, please keep this in mind: just because some people have a colour impairment that doesn't mean they are all colour blind (most of them aren't). They can see just what you can see, but some parts of the spectrum may appear paler and thus the nuances may be hard to tell apart. They'll probably have little problem telling two colours apart when they touch, but can't reliably recognise them as distinct when they're not.<p>It's okay to use colour in your design. It's even okay to use colours that are often problematic for people with colour impairments. It's not okay to RELY on them, tho. Especially if you rely on telling roughly similar colours apart (say, bluish purple and blue, or even dark red and dark green).<p>If you have to use colour as a signal, use another one as a failsafe -- use different patterns, borders or underlines in addition to different-coloured fills, outlines and texts.<p>The idea is not to sacrifice, but to enhance -- this is true for every form of accessibility, actually.<p>If you can't use strongly contrasting colours (i.e. different hue and value at high saturation) due to design constraints, simply make sure colour is not the only contrast you provide -- if all else fails just use markup to ensure the unstyled page still retains a contrast.<p>Oh, and don't forget to set your background and text colours in pairs. Even if you want to keep the default for one of them (white background, black text). This is not for accessibility alone, this is also for people like me who use a dark desktop theme and curse every time they see a form with black text on a (desktop default) dark background or a white background with (desktop default) bright green text on it. Like this very form I'm writing in -- good thing the web developer toolbar comes with a ""ignore page colours"" option.",1258299446

942980,comment,942095,942896,0,0,wallflower,,,"> Have you ever seen the Dog Whisperer?<p>Cesar Milan's body language communicates to dogs and humans that he is the leader.<p>""When Cesar walked down the stairs of Patrice and Scott's home then, and crouched down in the back yard, JonBee looked at him, intently. And what he saw was someone who moved in a very particular way. Cesar is fluid. ""He's beautifully organized intra-physically,"" Karen Bradley, who heads the graduate dance program at the University of Maryland, said when she first saw tapes of Cesar in action. ""That lower-unit organization—I wonder whether he was a soccer player."" Movement experts like Bradley use something called Laban Movement Analysis to make sense of movement, describing, for instance, how people shift their weight, or how fluid and symmetrical they are when they move, or what kind of ""effort"" it involves. Is it direct or indirect—that is, what kind of attention does the movement convey? Is it quick or slow? Is it strong or light—that is, what is its intention? Is it bound or free—that is, how much precision is involved? If you want to emphasize a point, you might bring your hand down across your body in a single, smooth motion. But how you make that motion greatly affects how your point will be interpreted by your audience. Ideally, your hand would come down in an explosive, bound movement—that is, with accelerating force, ending abruptly and precisely—and your head and shoulders would descend simultaneously, so posture and gesture would be in harmony. Suppose, though, that your head and shoulders moved upward as your hand came down, or your hand came down in a free, implosive manner—that is, with a kind of a vague, decelerating force. Now your movement suggests that you are making a point on which we all agree, which is the opposite of your intention. Combinations of posture and gesture are called phrasing, and the great communicators are those who match their phrasing with their communicative intentions—who understand, for instance, that emphasis requires them to be bound and explosive. To Bradley, Cesar had beautiful phrasing.""<p>""What the Dog Saw"" by Malcolm Gladwell<p><a href=""http://www.gladwell.com/2006/2006_05_22_a_dog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gladwell.com/2006/2006_05_22_a_dog.html</a>",1258298697

942978,comment,942892,942892,0,0,chime,,,"> (you know, the one you really should be working on right now).<p>This is the problem really. Don't compel yourself to do anything you don't want to. Don't guilt yourself into thinking that you should be doing something else instead of what you really want to do. Stop doing this in the name of productivity, efficiency, ambition, or goals. Instead, focus your energy on making yourself realize why something must be done, if it needs to be done at all. If you can convince yourself that it needs to be done, then you will have no problem doing it and will in fact do it willingly. If you can't convince yourself why it needs to be done, then you should do something to make sure you don't have to do it.<p>E.g., writing a school paper for a class you don't much care for. That is something that happens to me because some of my required Masters classes are a bit too easy (in fact my undergrad courses in the same subjects were much more advanced). I tell myself that life is a learning experience and writing well is an art that I must continually practice to remain proficient, regardless of the subject matter or specific task at hand. Knowing that this one 10-page assignment is a small piece of the bigger jigsaw puzzle of my life as student makes me want to work on it. Not because I love the class but because I see how this particular assignment fits into the big plan I have previously made. I always try to stick with my big plans unless there is a true reason not to. Is a 10 page assignment a true reason not to stick with my Masters degree and my academic plans? No. Then it is something that will take me one step closer to my final goal. Who doesn't want to take one more step in the right direction?<p>I don't play tricks with my brain or try to excite myself by small goals or high-scores (try to get an A+ in a 10pg paper I wrote in 2hrs). I see a lot of advice in these motivational / GTD type posts that are mostly tricks and advice on lying to yourself. I don't set my clocks 10mins ahead. I try to understand why it must be so instead of fooling myself and hoping that a safety-net for my follies will somehow help me.<p>Why do I work on the really boring project at work that nobody else wants to help me on? Because I understand that this is something that helps with the bigger picture of my career. If it doesn't, then I will make sure I don't have to do it. I don't want to live a life avoiding things that must be done or playing tricks on myself just so I do things I don't want to do. If I sit back and truly don't want to do something, I make sure I don't have to do it.<p>This doesn't mean I look forward to doing the dishes. Wife and I both hate doing the dishes and we avoid using too many pots and pans while cooking. However, I do the dishes whenever I can because it makes the misses happy and that is my bigger goal. Doing the dishes gets me one step closer to marital bliss and who doesn't want that? Do I really want to claim ""honey I will do the dishes"" and do them reluctantly only because I claimed that publicly? Or do I do the dishes willingly because it makes my wife happy and thus me happy?",1258298525

It's also a serious issue because you're really talking about lost sales here, not just hypothetical sales.<p>Private copyright infringement (e.g. mom downloading some MP3s) is hard to spot and even harder to persecute. You can't talk about lost sales because the amount pirated is in no relation to the amount that could have been sold -- if you've got a 80/20 distribution between pirated and sold, it's absurd to claim 80% lost sales.<p>If you're talking about real profit losses for the actual producer (i.e. the artist, developer or whatever), private copyright infringement is negligible.<p>In fact, the low cost of private copyright infringement could be soothed even more if the producers would allow for easy ways of donation (PayPal, whatever): in many cases the ""lost sales"" were lost because the would-be-customer wouldn't have paid the amount asked or was simply not willing to take the risk of paying for something before knowing they like it.<p>Whether you like it or not, private copyright infringement is here to stay (and has been here ever since the invention of copyright law). You can't stop it. You only have the choice between accepting it as a fact of life and trying to work with it (viral marketing, commercial support for Free software, live concerts, etc etc), or ignoring the social costs of your actions and trying to punish all the ""evildoers"" one-by-one making examples of the students and grandmas you actually manage to draw into courtrooms.<p>Publishing companies are not going to die over this, but their role will deflate back into what it had been before the record industry / Hollywood boom: as a service provider to the real artists, offering to do the marketing for them, arrange concerts and publish their work in physical form.

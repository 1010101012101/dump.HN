However, to the best of my knowledge that transition usually involves moving to a mostly-custom setup dependent on the app&#x27;s specific needs.<p>It&#x27;s not clear exactly what functionality Polyglot provides beyond, say, raw RabbitMQ, but if it can find a way to encode best practices in a service-oriented architecture it could be a handy tool for developers going through this process for the first time.",1405349918
8031197,comment,8030413,8030869,3,0,moogleii,,,"To expound a bit more on faet&#x27;s reply, pick either the top or bottom row as your workspace. I&#x27;ll assume bottom.<p>Generally speaking the beginning doesn&#x27;t really matter all that much so just start building up numbers however you see fit (some people go left right left right multiple times before crunching downwards). But start building and pinning your largest number on either the left or right corner. So, for example, try to make a 32, and pin it in the bottom right. Then start working on a 16 to its left, and an 8 to the 16&#x27;s left, and a 4 to the 8&#x27;s left. Generally, I try to make sure the entire workspace row is locked as often as possible by making sure it&#x27;s always filled. This minimizes the chance that you&#x27;ll need to unpin the largest number from its corner.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got your workspace row locked, there are a few things you can do. I haven&#x27;t decided which I really prefer yet, but I basically just start creating another workspace row above the first workspace row. I&#x27;ll usually try to focus on creating row #2&#x27;s largest number on the opposite side of row #1&#x27;s pinned corner number so that I can start crunching downwards as numbers begin to vertically match.<p>That&#x27;s the very general gist of it. There are a few minor special case tactics you can use, but I&#x27;ll leave that for you. Oh, and as faet said, don&#x27;t swipe up (if your workspace is at the bottom). It&#x27;s a recoverable mistake, but can make things much more difficult if you get a 2 stuck below your workspace (but it does kind of add some more spark to the game trying to recover from it). Personally, once you start using this strategy, the biggest thing you need to look out for is to not create a scenario where the game will generate 3 locked rows, because that will force you to swipe up. You&#x27;ll see what I mean. Good luck.",1405349915
8031196,comment,8029162,8030973,6,0,logfromblammo,,,"I think probably the only way to do it correctly is to divide the participants into two groups.  In group A, they work 30 hour weeks for 3 months, then work 40 hour weeks for 3 months.  In group B, they start with 40 hour weeks, then go to 30 hour weeks.<p>You can&#x27;t actually hide control/experiment status from the test subjects, though.  You usually know if you are working more or fewer hours in a week.  There is some danger that people will intentionally slack off while doing 40s and bust their ass while doing 30s, just so the experimental results suggest shorter work weeks.  To counter that, you have a huge number of people following the protocol, and the researchers  and participants simply don&#x27;t know exactly whose data will be randomly selected for inclusion in the study.",1405349910

8031187,comment,8030777,8030777,11,0,Xorlev,,,"&quot;Messsage queue - a queue that receives the messages that represent the HTTP request. the acceptor accepts HTTP requests and converts the requests into messages that goes into the message queue. The messages then gets picked up by the next component, the responder. The implementation of the message queue is a RabbitMQ server.&quot;<p>Alrighty then. Someone has never scaled RabbitMQ vs. a basic HTTP service. If raw scalability is what you&#x27;re looking for w/ a polyglot backend, an edge service that accepts HTTP and turns those requests into Thrift structs (or similar) to RPC to various polyglot services might be better for you. This is the model most use.<p>However, I&#x27;m unsure how this&#x27;ll be more &#x27;performant&#x27; than picking the right technology from the start and architecting wisely. Generally, the more performant you want something to be the simpler you build it and only compromise where necessary. Thrift/RabbitMQ are definitely complexity compromises.<p>Complexity is the bane of scalability.<p>Additionally, if you needed pure scalability, you generally have purpose-built services for each &quot;responder&quot; which is load balanced over. Pretty similar to this, minus the message queue.<p>I imagine having a message queue in the middle of your HTTP response path could lead to some nasty latency spikes too. Much better to drop a request with a 503 than have the next N spin for minutes while workers chug through it. Especially if you&#x27;re taking in 10K req/s.<p>Last thought: The benchmarks are lacking detail, could use a more thorough job.",1405349696

(Many people in Finland have a summer cottage in the countryside, and rely on a car to get to it.)<p>I&#x27;ve never understood why people are so hung up about renting vehicles (not hourly rental; traditional, daily rental). Considering the cost of buying, maintaining, depreciating, and parking a car it is SO much cheaper (and easier) to simply rent from a traditional rental company for these long road trips. Need a 4x4? Rent it! Want a convertible for that coastal road trip? Rent it! Want to race on a track? Rent it! (this  last one is still prohibitively expensive though).<p>In fact, some companies (Enterprise) will even pick you up at your home, making the rental process that much easier. If you have a good credit card it often includes insurance, which reduces the cost considerably (making daily rental competitive with hourly-rental services over a few hours of use).<p>Combine daily-rental vehicles with this sort of Helsinki plan and I literally can&#x27;t see a reason why anyone would want a car.",1405348092

Second, the Legislature, pushed by the then Governor, set up statewide open enrollment<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.h...</a><p>and the opportunity for advanced learners to attend up to two years of college while still high school students on the state&#x27;s dime.<p><a href=""http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index...</a><p>And Minnesota also has the oldest charter school statute in the United States.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Chance-Passage-Pioneering-Charter/dp/1592984762/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Chance-Passage-Pioneering-Charter...</a><p>Parents in Minnesota now have more power to shop than parents in most states.

The game is also remarkably polished with legitimately excellent music and a ton of personality. It&#x27;s been a while since I checked up on the myriad of 2048 clones, so maybe something&#x27;s changed, but none of them that I tried seemed to have either the same degree of strategy or polish or charm that Threes has.<p>My introduction to this &quot;genre&quot; was through the first web-based 2048 clone posted here on HN, so if anything I should be biased towards that. But when I picked up Threes I was just flat-out impressed with the cohesiveness of the experience, which went above and beyond 2048 in basically all ways--strategy, art, etc.<p>At the end of the day, I imagine it comes down to a few simple things. First, Threes is not free. Second, difficulty calibration. Threes is probably just too difficult, which prevented it from hitting critical mass as fast as 2048 did (which is, IMHO, trivial in comparison). Third, sound.

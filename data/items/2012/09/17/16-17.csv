If you play the SEO game at all (and let's face it, most web companies do at least a little bit), then you have to pay attention to Google+ because it's showing up on search results.

I wish I had something like this in high school, because I did so much work outside of school with jobs and collaborations I did with other people, but schools weren't interested in this information, but employers were.<p>If there was an easy way for those people writing scholarships were able to filter through candidates based on their merits and their connections, it would be an easy way to show the students dedication to their field, and the fact that they have done so much to move forward their goals.<p>----<p>On another note, I really don't think it's necessary to highlight 'ful' in your logo.  I understand the site is trying to be similar to LinkedIn, but it almost makes it look like it's part of the LinkedIn family when it's really not.<p>Look at the favicon, or app icon for LinkedIn.  They only say 'in' distinctively, I believe that it's the focus is because you're 'in a network, in a circle, in with people'.  On your site, you're highlighting 'ful', but your favicon is the 'M' for Merit.  There is no branding in the 'M', it's very generic.<p>I suggest thinking of a simple avatar, or icon to use as a symbol and have that be highlighted.  Some sort of representation of what your site is.  That way, <i>that</i> can be highlighted, and <i>that</i> can be your favicon, app icon, etc.  <i>That</i> will distinctively be your branding.<p>Just so you know I'm not talking out of my ass, I work in the web development section for a huge clothing retailer.

4533499,comment,4516131,4516687,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Performance is a huge bullet point for me. A language such as Python or Ruby requires you to make considerations (writing performance-sensitive code by shelling out to a native C extension, for example) that don't crop up in a natively compiled language such as Go.<p>In fact, for performance-sensitive things the difference is often staggering, even for things that scripting languages were originally invented for, such as text processing. Performance-sensitive doesn't always mean ""DSP or graphics code"". If you want to process huge log files in Ruby, for example, you can start as many threads you like to attempt to parallelize it without getting anywhere because of the global interpreter lock, and will find yourself resorting to things like forking off child processes. Ruby would be a bad fit <i>because</i> it does not perform well. I often end up writing such processing code in Lua (using LuaJIT) because of the dramatic difference in performance.<p>One must always consider the domain, but performance <i>is</i> one important facet of Go: Go gives you high performance without sacrificing much of the expressiveness of dynamic languages such as Python and Ruby. (Conversely, C/C++ gives you high performance without the same expressiveness.) If Go had the same VM as Ruby I would probably never consider using it for anything, as I don't see any language-level benefits that outweigh the performance aspect.",1347900978

If you have a window of time over which you know your distributions are stationary, you should always use a logarithmic regret MAB algorithm because it is theoretically better.<p>I think the best way to frame this argument is that because the domain does not match the assumptions of MAB, A/B testing has been shown to be robust and easy to modify for non-stationary domains, while logarithmic regret algorithms are somewhat more fragile.",1347900665

In terms of avoiding computation, you can only limit queries by document key, which even if you're clever/lucky doesn't always encode the parameters you're querying on, or doesn't encode them in the right order, so you should be prepared to run queries over your entire dataset.  Hopefully the queries you run often are optimized (e.g., using indexes or clever use of key ranges), but in the general case, you have to be prepared to scan the whole shebang, and that's supposed to be okay because of horizontal scalability, right?",1347899850

A simple case-insensitive regex is not very bad performance-wise, but in general, case-insensitive searches should be avoided for search purposes (you can normalize to set everything to lower case or other equivalent trick)<p>- The proper way of doing an audit (and search later) is to make an independent collection with a reference to the other(s) document in a different collection. Then you can index by user, date, or any other field and leave the main collection alone. The described embedded access collection doesn't look very scalable.<p>- Making map-reduce queries is tricky (at least for me). I think the guys on 10gen realizes that and the new aggregation framework is a way of dealing with this. Anyway, the main advantage of SQL is this kind of things, the rich query capabilities. Even if MongoDB allows some compared with other NoSQL DBs, if there is a lot of work in defining new queries, probably a SQL DB is the best fit, as that is where SQL excel.<p>I don't truly believe in this ""you should research everything before starting"" (I mean, I believe in research, but too many times the ""you should do your homework"" argument is overused. Sometimes you make a decision based in some data that changes later, or is incomplete), as there are a lot of situations where you find problems as you go, not in the first steps. But, according to the description, looks like PostgreSQL is a better match and the transition hasn't been too painful, so we can classify this into ""bump in the road""/""success history"".\nAlso, probably right now the DB schema is way more known that in the beginning, which simplifies the use of a relational DB.",1347898712

In the case of HTTP, there are tons of things people want to be able to do: all of those headers he is complaining about <i>do something</i>, and as someone who uses HTTP quite often I am honestly not certain which ones I'd be willing to live without... you could always encode them differently, but that's again just a syntax problem: the semantics of a distributed document database that is flexible enough to support the notion that people speak different languages, that file formats go in and out of style, that you may want or need third-parties to proxy information for purposes of either filtering or improving performance and yet at the same time allows for state to be persisted and only sometimes shared on cached documents... this is a hard problem, and when ""lots of people have thought it would be [trivial]"" they are just being naive, and I'd go so far as to say ""disrespectful"" of the hard work put in by the people who came before them in the attempt to design these specifications.<p>To then respond to one of the specific points you made, the ""violations in layering"", this guy's proposal is itself a layering violation (something I had originally spent some time complaining about in my first post, but then removed as I realized there was no point defending implementation details from someone who doesn't feel people should read the spec): imagine what it would mean to have these kinds of requests coming through a proxy server... what does the proxy server do about the state? You either have the proxy treated as a pass-through, in which case the state is going to get highly muddled and require one-to-one connection mapping through the proxy, or you are going to have the proxy handle its own state, which will ruin the performance benefits of not having to do multiple round-trips (as the proxy will have to wait for the previous request to come back before sending the new one).<p>Even if he did have something actually better, the people who built these specifications that he's ranting about had the really hard problem of getting a bunch of people who had differing ideas about what they were willing or wanting to implementing and had varying amounts of resources and ability to alter existing systems; honestly, I think they've done a great job on the whole, and I have absolutely no faith that if this guy were somehow in their place that we would have ended up with something different, and certainly not something better. The idea that someone then just spends a bunch of time ranting about the work these people did (or even the real-world complexities that the people working on Apache httpd ran into that caused them to end up with some of the specific incompatibilities mentioned) without really painting a picture of the original context, finding out what the various challenges and goals were, and then pointing out specific ways the result could have worked out differently with the available information.

I appreciate more systems to post jobs and review candidates directly, but after LinkedIn and Craigslist, the value diminishes.  I've also worked with recruiters who are highly qualified and present good candidates.<p>A solution would be a system to help you find a better recruiter and create more transparency in that industry.<p>I can envision a system whereby you can rate your interactions with recruiters (ie., Yelp for recruiting).<p>""I used [recruiter] and they found me [x] candidates in [y] days.  The quality of the candidates was [z] and I [hired/didnt hire] someone that they presented.  I [would/wouldn't] work with them again.

You would rate them on these vectors, and then you could build a search tool that helps you find the right recruiter.  (""Find me a BioTech Recruiter in Seattle who works with Genentech on a flat fee"" etc)<p>This would also have a benefit keep recruiters more honest.  The good recruiters would rise to the top, and potentially get more leads.  You wouldn't have to waste as much time with poor recruiters since they would be outed pretty quickly.

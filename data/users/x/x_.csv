Xcelerate,,5344,4.02273,77,1011,"I am a PhD student at the University of Tennessee.  My research goals are twofold:<p>1) Develop a highly general method for generating on-the-fly molecular dynamics potentials that are both fast and accurate by applying data science techniques (machine learning, kernel methods, etc.) to the results of slower but more accurate simulations (e.g., DFT or QMC).<p>2) Develop methods to extract archetypal atomic neighborhoods from novel materials.  Experimental data describing these materials is obtained via atom probe tomography; however, the data is corrupted by a large amount of noise and missing information.  Recent research in rank recovery and matrix completion (e.g., the Netflix problem) provides a way to reveal the underlying low-dimensional patterns that exist in the data in an unbiased way.<p>In order to test the effectiveness of these methods, I am using them to study the localization of lithium ions in novel carbon composite anodes developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  These anodes are both crystalline and amorphous, and thus the Li-ions diffuse and localize in highly non-obvious ways.",1339127290,1452893667

Xenmen,,25,0.0,1,26,"Nintendo DS homebrew was the greatest experience of my life. I learned more doing that, in less time, than anything else I&#x27;ve ever worked on. That was my &#x27;Commodore/BASIC&#x27; experience.<p>Personal website: daniel.tadeuszow.com/<p>I&#x27;m a Canadian dev in Vancouver with an interest in automated agriculture as a municipal utility. I hope to prove the viability of automated resource production as a strong alternative to charity and a vicious labour market.<p>Bash and Python are my primary scripting tools. I enjoy C, though in my current circumstances I can&#x27;t justify getting more experience. I decided to prioritize learning javascript and HTML, since webdev is eating the lunch of young conventional programmers who work at a slow pace (like I do).<p>After much experimentation, and soul searching, I&#x27;ve settled on Nodejs as my server foundation. It runs on a machine with 128MB RAM, which I use as my main host, so my yearly hosting cost is $15 [ http://tinyvz.com/ ].<p>My bucket list consists of making remixes to old game music, and releasing them in tracker formats, such as .xm. Open Source music promotes remix culture!<p>The Soundtrack highest on my priority list is Perfect Dark. Presently I am using Ableton, as I hope to hone my skills in such a way that I can moonlight as a DJ with minimal setup time. Using my remixing dream as a way to drive my most relaxing passtime seemed a good compromise until I have the financial stability to recreate them in .xm.\nhttps://xenmen.bandcamp.com/album/alone-with-joanna-dark<p>Writing more NDS homebrew and SDL toys would be a nice passtime. I hear Rust is nice, but I&#x27;d rather learn how to wield Nodejs and such first. My ideal future is a mobile home with rain collector, solar power, and &#x27;soylent box&#x27;, a mythical device that refines materials in the wild into delicious soylent-comparable mush.\nThat&#x27;d be living the dream :]",1390788284,1450207814

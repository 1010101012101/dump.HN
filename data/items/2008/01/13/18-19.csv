For some people more than others, the conditions of a job (9-5 every day, don't choose your own work) just dont work.  I used to love my work but hated that it was a job, so I quit.<p>My advice is to find the most self motivated person you know, quit and do a startup with them.  Your desire to work hard along with their relentless persistence will be a great combo.  Also, working 14-15 hours a day is a breeze when its for yourself.<p>Until then use this to block the net at work\n<a href=""http://thingsilearned.wordpress.com/2007/05/04/combating-internet-addiction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thingsilearned.wordpress.com/2007/05/04/combating-int...</a><p>Try skipping out on meetings as much as possible and work long but less days (your personal schedule) as much as you can.

97923,comment,97709,97804,0,0,dcurtis,,,"True. The reason I so deeply disrespect the man, though, is because with that 10 million dollars he has done absolutely nothing to advance the experience of people on his site.<p>It's also possible that he could take his huge customer base and monetize it more effectively by introducing new features and making the experience better. But he's so lazy/apathetic that he wont even write a script to keep the pictures the right aspect ratio.<p>Sure he makes 10 million dollars a year, he provides a great service, etc, but in the end he's not really contributing anything to society but a well-baked cake with dog shit frosting.",1200250461
97922,comment,97829,97841,0,0,mrtron,,,"I think you are dead on; you need to find a job you enjoy.  When I was a student I was lucky enough to do 6 co-op terms (internships).  \nDuring this time I learned that your actual productivity is not being measured.  The majority of your performance is measured relative to other coworkers, and simply the perception on how smart and hard you work.  On one co-op term, I was highly regarded, but only doing what I considered 2 hours of work per day.  However, I was doing all they expected of me and continually asking for more work, so they thought I was fantastic.  I was able to do this by working smarter, not harder.  Another co-op term at a small company I was doing 6+ hours of work (again, from my perspective) and I did not get a good review at all.  This was because I was doing about half the work of the other programmers there, who were very senior and experienced developers.  Additionally, there were no opportunities to work smarter, I just had to churn out a lot of code in a very confined way.<p>So, I quickly learned that\na) your employer is judging your work on their perception of performance, not what you think\nb) in order to excel, you need to be in a position to work smarter<p>All of this brings me to the conclusion that in order to succeed you need to be set up for success.",1200249575

97915,comment,97902,97902,0,0,cperciva,,,"Single-image systems like Linux-VServer (or FreeBSD jails) are more efficient than fully virtualized systems like Xen (or VMWare); however, they're not as secure (the userland-kernel interface is far wider than a kernel-virtualizer interface, so there's far more potential for escape-from-jail bugs) and the fact that there are more shared resources increases the potential for a busy website to cause other sites on the same physical hardware to slow down.<p>Personally, I wouldn't hesitate about using a jailed system for testing purposes, but I'd want a fully virtualized instance (or real hardware) for a production site.",1200248934

They are very much risk-averse.  This is a strange comment but as an entrepreneur, I differentiate between taking risk and mitigating ambiguity.<p>I don't gamble and I don't play the lottery.  I think doing so would be taking undue risk because I have absolutely no control of the outcome.<p>On the other hand, doing startup is not risk to me because I believe I can control the outcome.  It is just that the outcome is somewhat ambiguous which I know how to mitigate.<p>I suppose if I take a step back, this is not unlike the difference between an amateur gambler and a professional gambler.  If I know how to count cards, I won't think that I am taking risk neither.<p>--Denny--",1200248767

97911,comment,97302,97440,0,0,sethjohn,,,"Come on, the laptops are not being given people for whom access to food, water, and protection from the elements is a problem. The point is to provide the educated working poor in 2nd/3rd world countries access to tools so that they can improve their lives.<p>And for these people, access to education and communication is very, very important. To take one example: farmers in rural India have a very hard time getting a fair price for their crops because they can't access price information before harvest, they basically have to just hop on a bus to the nearest big village and take whatever price is offered by the middleman that day. Poor communication leads to an inefficient economy.<p>If you don't think that laptops are the most efficient way to help these people out, what are you proposing instead?",1200248177

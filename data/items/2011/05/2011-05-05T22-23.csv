There are plenty of places that aren't Google or Facebook that are software technology companies: where managers are technical, where engineers are judged on their technical skills and application thereof. Of course, non-technical skills matter everywhere and generally the larger the company is, the more important self-promotion and politics become. Yet if you're good (not just great), you should be able to find a place where management is technical and your technical skills are an asset: if you haven't, keep studying the fundamentals (interviews heavily focus on Computer Science) and take an active role in your industry (open source, etc...): connections you make, that can vouch for quality of your code <i>will</i> be able to make references that actually get you in the door.",1304635675

But to turn this into an algorithm, you'd need a computable bound.  For a language like C, I think such a bound probably exists and is a reasonable function of the input size.  For a language like Coq, though, I doubt the bound would be computable.  Basically, I think that there are programs that work for reasons that are very difficult to prove.<p>Also, I think we're far enough from practical that appeals to the real world are somewhat silly.

And they were struggling to find better ways to do signage and wayfinding.<p>If we have e-ink panels that were easily integrated into structures and addressable (arduino wifi cards) we could really do some interesting things with signage.<p>Let the tablet market takes its course, while e-ink fills in areas that tablets are too much.",1304633188

Yes, intent-based advertising converts better. But that's irrelevent.<p>In Google's limited view of the world, life starts when the customer is looking for your product. As an advertiser on Facebook, I can raise awareness for my product first, then convert those people who are interested. So when you look at CPC or CPM on Facebook, keep in mind that you derive two values from your ads: awareness and intent. Google only does intent, so their CPC numbers look ""better"" but it's a misperception.",1304632900

There are also a lot of other tradeoffs that you need to think about: do unproved assertions get converted to runtime checks or to compile errors? Can you implement that efficiently? How will type inference work? Is it OK to design an unsound type system? etc etc.<p>I can give you some pointers if you want to look for something more specific.",1426888780

3. Irrelevant/FUD? No normal user &#x27;saves&#x27; web-pages, unless it&#x27;s something like a receipt, which any sane dev would make a separate html page and not part of the app.
4. is totally false as screen-readers support JavaScript.
5. is false/strawman as any half-sane SPA developer still authenticates using a regular back-end framework and I&#x27;ve no idea what &#x27;If you app loads content from a server that isn&#x27;t yours&#x27; has to do with single-page apps.",1426888778

Also, this could come across any number of ways if you&#x27;re coming from a different place (socioeconomic wise). For instance. Well off families tend to have less children and are in a position to provide for them. So, if I&#x27;m poor and can&#x27;t afford to take care of my kids properly, you&#x27;re proposing I just don&#x27;t have them?<p>I use that example only to emphasize what I think is already implicit in your comment, that this is a super complex issue. My reaction to the article was similar to yours, just from a different angle.

9240882,comment,9238086,9240746,0,0,archagon,,,"I think the WTC can be appreciated even if you don&#x27;t know the mechanics of counterpoint. I finally found the wonder in the WTC when I was doing an assignment that required us track the themes in one of the fugues. Mine was Book 1, Fugue 4. Having never listened to any of the pieces with the score in hand, it was enlightening to find not only the specific instances, but also the rhythms, the contours, and the sub-motifs from each theme seemingly in every nook and cranny of the piece. Nor were the themes constrained in any way: they morphed into one another, played against one another, and fundamentally changed the feel of the piece as they made their entrances. It felt like the musical material was <i>liquid</i>. The effect was emotional and profound, but it wasn&#x27;t something that could be put into words; this was music talking.<p>I took away a lifelong lesson from this 1 hour listening session, and all it required was the score and my attention. Counterpoint is a rhetorical tool, and I think it can be fundamentally understood and appreciated even without performing the full dissection.<p>I also recommend Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Etude-Tableau Op. 39 No. 4 in B Minor for counterpoint appreciation. That piece never fails to blow my mind. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLotW5AKjg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLotW5AKjg</a>",1426888220

The good part about single page apps is that they deliver a package of code, then are able to keep local state and communicate with the server over a stateless protocol. Oh, and the current breed runs on a platform (browsers) that is installed on every PC and mobile device.

Instead, I have to find a pattern in it and use the pattern to reconstruct it. For example, I could never remember random formulas for e.g. solving the quadratic equation or taking a derivative, but once I figured out how they worked, I could use them right away. This is why I decided to study physics in college: physics has very few pieces of info you have to just memorize.<p>The downside, besides having a horrible time remembering some chemical formula, or the year of the French revolution, is that I also cannot use a formula correctly unless I know how it is derived. I must walk every step of the proof before I can use any part of the formula, otherwise my brain simply refuses to see it correctly.<p>Interestingly enough, I am blessed with very good memory for situations and associations. I can tell you exactly how many olives were in the martini I ordered in July 2008 (3), or quote lines from my favorite shows at every occasion.

Know your body and your mind and your tics. If I don&#x27;t get 8 hours of sleep, for example, I get irritable and have trouble focusing. I&#x27;ve had arguments with managers and executives about this before, and frankly I&#x27;ll quit before I&#x27;ll commit to working at not my best. Having my ass in the chair at 9 sharp, tired and bleary and cranky, does nobody any good--especially if waiting a mere hour would result in like 4x the productivity. If your bosses can&#x27;t see this, and you can&#x27;t show them numerically that you are producing, you need to leave your job. Speaking of showing progress...<p><i>Make todo lists</i>. Whether in an issue tracker, post-its, notebook, or mad scrawlings on your cube wall, make notes of the next few things you need to get done. Annotate those things with the mid-to-low level deliverables or requirements. This is not just to keep track of where everything is, but also to help you get right back into context when you need to switch gears. Moreover, this also helps you audit what you&#x27;ve been <i>doing</i> the last few months.<p><i>Write sloppy solutions first</i>. Don&#x27;t lose steam fighting optimizations, unless that is the exact goal you&#x27;re trying to accomplish. Welders use tack welds (teeny welds that are fast) to shape up a workpiece before going to do everything--similarly, use the obvious solutions (preferably functional ones if the language, like JS, affords them) and then go back and clean things up in a subsequent pass.<p><i>Accept that you&#x27;ll waste time</i>. I know that some amount of random garbage (chats, twitter, HN, etc.) is useful for helping reset my brain. On bad days, it even gives me a place to vent while I&#x27;m waiting on solving problems and gives me a sense of community. Don&#x27;t begrudge yourself this, and instead focus on learning to recognize when you&#x27;ve gotten that recharge and can go back at things.<p><i>Do the medium-detail design work up front, and write it down</i>. Especially at hackathons or during stressful times or even when just spewing code because you&#x27;re not on the ball, it&#x27;s really easy to code yourself into corners. So, the design work is a guardrail to help nudge you onto the right path. This way you won&#x27;t get into a situation where you have to throw away a lot of work.<p>EDIT:<p>One more thing.<p>The measure of a good engineer isn&#x27;t how awesome they are when they&#x27;re at their best--it&#x27;s what and how consistently they can deliver when they&#x27;re not.",1426886932

My point is that engineers (early and otherwise) should not accept that their contribution is worth so much less than the 2-3 people on top.

MuseScore and Lilypond are both GNU GPL and so libre software. The fact that the project uses &quot;Open&quot; Well Tempered Clavier is indeed probably misleading but for most people they get it: The goods are released directly in the public domain and in formats that can be read by software with libre license, and than can be converted in many more formats for different usage.<p>Lilypond is an amazing piece of software. I still use it from time to time. It&#x27;s great, no dicussion about it. But...<p>1/ Where is the specification, parser implementation and source code for reading writing lilypond format? MuseScore had  once a Lilypond exporter and importer but nobody could maintain it any more because of the lack of such a spec. And this is perfectly understandable. Lilypond is powerful and need a powerful language and it&#x27;s extremely hard to document in a formal way. As far as I know, only Lilypond can read Lilypond files. MuseScore format is not documented either, except in the code source. For both software, Also it makes little sense to document the file format since a lot of details in the score are not in the file format. For example, the position of the accidentals in a chord is not encoded in MuseScore or Lilypond files. However, they can provide export filters in documented formats MIDI and MusicXML.<p>2/ Ever tried to render a Lilypond 2.18 file with Lilypond 2.10? it will fail the same way that MuseScore 1.3 (probably the version in the repositories) will fail at reading MuseScore 2.0 files. And it&#x27;s probably true for a lot software still in development. I guess that Blender or GIMP native file formats are not forward compatible either. Does that make this format not open? Maybe, so what? In any case it&#x27;s perfectly understandable, format needs to be upgraded to support new features.<p>3/ The standard &quot;documented&quot; format for music notation interchange is MusicXML. It&#x27;s proprietary but under a royalty free licence. There are ongoing discussions to make it a W3C standard. MuseScore import and export MusicXML files. Anyone can get the MusicXML file for the OpenWTC scores. This file can be imported in Lilypond. Unfortunately, Lilypond cannot export MusicXML though. It&#x27;s one of the oldest feature request in the Lilypond bug tracker...<p>In the end, there are two more works in the public domain in a variety of formats that can be used for many different use cases.

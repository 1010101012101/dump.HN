- Once you have more than 4 blue tags in the field, additional ones don't get added or aren't visible. It's probably best to add another line of height to see them all. Or to avoid the problem entirely, take the resolved 'tags' out of the input box and put them below. Perhaps by accepting a jQuery selector for where they should be dropped?
- It would be nice if the 'prompt' option also read from the html5 placeholder attribute
- tag items that are set should probably be settable via the option value not the display text, or maybe both?
- An option to remove the blue arrow: if you have thousands of items in the list you don't want to display them all.",1326473808

I don't really consider that an issue as it is common to have apps use different themes and styles for UI widgets. The important point is that within your own app, you can enforce a theme that hasn't been tinkered with by the app manufacturer, giving you a stable theme to work with or modify as you write your app.<p>As an example of this, recent versions of the Motorola theme have altered ListViews such that any empty space after the last list item in the view uses their custom off-white background and ignores what background you may have set on the ListView itself. For me, this is a very annoying, inconsistent change that clashes with the design of some apps, so I would target Theme.Holo to make sure that I am working with the standard ListView theme and my modifications work as I expect them.<p>This is the great power of this change for ICS, as now I can opt-out of carrier customizations and stop having specific work arounds and hacks for some devices to avoid their custom theme from the manufacturer.",1326472952

To claim that jumping was a valuable process is a bit far fetched. I could have gotten that same lesson by simply taking a course in aerodynamics, or better yet, watching those black and white videos from the history channel of people in the 1900s doing similar stunts before the Wright brothers came along. Having worked at startups for a bunch of years & having interviewed with several others & speaking with their founders in person, I see a very distinct divide. The vast majority are building things ""we don't need"", throwing stuff at the wall and hoping something will stick. Purely from a statistical perspective, something will indeed stick. otoh the very tiny minority that are building stuff we do need are handicapped by too many factors to even have a remote chance of success.",1326472302

3461183,comment,3459266,3460777,5,0,rdtsc,,,"> It's entirely possible that TSA screening prevented someone getting on a plane with a weapon of some sort<p>I disagree with that statement. ""It could"" is hard to measure. We spend 100s of billions of $ on something based on this unproven hypothesis.<p>Keep in mind, TSA was created to catch terrorists red-handed as they are just about to board a plane. As in ""Hey look a bomb in the x-ray machine, arrest this guy!"". That is their purpose. They have not yet done that, once, in 10 years!<p>Govt. intelligence work and regular citizens have prevented and stopped attempts. There is some track record there. TSA doesn't have one.<p>By your metric one could have just as well re-defined TSA's mission as ""Protect the citizens of the United States of America against Evil Pink Elephants from Neptune"". Chances are very high that TSA's track record with that task would have been exactly what it is with their current mission. AND you could have still made your argument ""See no Pink Elephants from Neptune have attacked us, so they must be doing their job.""<p>Or think about it another way: How many airliners were blown up in US airspace before 9/11? Was it a monthly occurrence? Yearly? Now if was a yearly thing, and then TSA came along and it suddenly stopped, you could have made a correlation based argument saying, that it is probably because of fear of TSA that we didn't have any more attacks.<p>Yet another way to look at it. As a terrorist you are trying to instill terror and kill as many people as possible. A large gathering of people would maximize your impact. I wonder what places and events consistently create large queues of people waiting in line? What about also a place that would cripple and disrupt the economy and travel?

How much impact do workers in a steel mill have? What about other simple but very common (and very necessary) jobs like the building maintenance and cleaning?<p>There are a lot of jobs out there that do not really directly advance society or change human lives on a large scale or have any other big impact but they still exist and people make a living off off them. And I would say most jobs are like that - (very) few people ever get the chance to actually do something truly great, meaningful and have real, direct impact on ""real people"".<p>And despite all that, what do I contribute to society although I am quite unimportant? I pay my taxes, my insurances and thereby contribute to not only my own well-being. And any software I might have written or I am maintaining is doing something useful somewhere in a very specific context and it helps people do their job which again has some impact on others and enables a company to exist and do something people are willing to spend money on and thereby that company offers jobs and etc...<p>Nothing wrong with being ""just"" a small wheel in the humongous machinery that is our world. If you ask me, it is actually (a much welcome and appreciated) luxury of modern life that we can allow space for all those ""weirdos"", all the diddling-around and all those strange new jobs that ""real people"" don't understand.<p>Also, it is pretty megalomaniac to assume everyone working ""in IT"" or reading HN is really such a rockstar and genius that they might find themselves in a position where they suddenly change the lives of thousands of people. Just because you know C or Javascript or Rails doesn't automatically make you a shining beacon of advancement of the human condition. Many people who are much, much smarter and better educated than you and me are living just as ""unimportant"" lives and will very likely never have a chance to become the next Einstein or Robert Koch. Learn to be more humble.<p>And countless scientists and artists who did change the way we think forever only did so long time after they were dead because during their lifetime, they were lucky not to get burned at the stake or starve to death in bitter poverty.",1326471933

Or it might not. That relationship is called the price elasticity curve; every product has a different shape and optimization point. Learning the shape, and picking the optimization point, is a huge part of selling something.<p>But the key point is that it is the right of seller to place themselves on that curve. LogMeIn Ignition is $30 in the iOS App Store. Obviously they would sell more copies if it was 99 cents, but they've chosen their pricing strategy. Does the mere existence of greater demand make it ok for people to pirate that software instead? I don't think it does.<p>It's obviously true that there is not a 1:1 relationship between piracy and lost sales. But it's also not a 0:1...some pirated copies are in fact lost sales. And, what's lost in talking about this equivalence (or lack thereof) is the damage to the pricing strategy of the seller--even the copies they do sell will necessarily be lower on the price elasticity curve because piracy increases the volume.",1326470971

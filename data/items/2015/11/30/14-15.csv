Typically, insiders cannot comprehend how little is being invested in a project that presents such immense technical obstacles and also such potential. A graph commonly passed around among the insiders—an enduring scrap of twentieth-century budgetary ephemera—depicts the 1976 federal plan to build a working thermonuclear reactor. The graph tracks various scenarios for attaining fusion energy. The “maximum” effort, the most expensive up front, with initial spending as high as nine billion dollars a year, was projected to yield a reactor by 1990. The “moderate” effort, with spending never exceeding four billion dollars in a year, would take fifteen more years. The fusion community might be easy to criticize for its many unmet milestones, but for decades the United States has never come close to even the moderate effort. In 1977, when the American fusion budget was at its peak, government investment in the research, adjusted for inflation, was seven hundred million dollars; by 1991, this had fallen by more than half. It is now half a billion, not appreciably more than the Korean budget.<p>The chart was produced by Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), which was later subsumed into the Department of Energy and presumably represented the expert wisdom at the time. (Please correct me if you have info that most experts were in fact more optimistic.) It can be found, in 1976 dollars, as figure 1 here:<p><a href=""http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/Articles_2010/Winter_2009/Who_Killed_Fusion.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/Articles_2010/Winter_2...</a><p>I am having a hard time getting over the importance of this. For all the discussion of global warming, energy prices, population crunches, etc., etc., fusion is always ignored as a solution for the simple reason that people think it&#x27;s unfeasibly costly. And they think that only because they think it&#x27;s had a history of being grossly more expensive than promised. But if we&#x27;ve really known how much it would cost to get commercial fusion power since 1976, then this reasoning is completely faulty. So then if we just haven&#x27;t spent the modest amount of money on it...isn&#x27;t this insane? Someone please tell me what I&#x27;m missing.",1448894972

Burning it and using the heat to drive an engine destroys the exergy.  That means that the more oil you extract, the less oil remains.<p>By contrast, when we use rare earths, generally what we do is to concentrate them and put them into standardized products like automotive catalytic converters, glass, petrochemical catalysts, neodymium magnets, Nd:YAG lasers, or CRT phosphor dots, in which they are even more concentrated than in the ores we mined them from.  That means that the more rare earths you extract, <i>the more easily accessible rare-earth resource remains</i>, exactly the opposite of the situation with oil.  It&#x27;s just in landfills.<p>(There is also a small amount of loss from things like cigarette-lighter flints, which end up as urban dust of mixed lanthanoid oxides, and waste incineration.  Refining the outputs of these processes back into rare earth minerals is probably going to be difficult.  But that&#x27;s not where most of current rare-earth refining ends up.)<p>I don&#x27;t buy the environmental argument.  Yes, mining is dangerous.

The DSL subscriber pays for an internet connection at n Mbit/s. Note: The DSL subscriber does not pay for a line to their local central office, the product telcos sell to end customers is internet access. Now, these customers who have bought internet access request some data transfer from some server at Hetzner (for example), and Hetzner essentially says &quot;here, we have a few gigabytes of data for your customer, where should we drop them off so you can deliver them?&quot; - and the telco&#x27;s answer is &quot;we won&#x27;t, unless you pay us!&quot;<p>This is not about moving the data to the telco&#x27;s network, but about the telco delivering the packets to their customers. Cost-neutral peering does not mean free peering, those &quot;content providers&quot; complaining about net neutrality violations do not complain because they have to pay for a line from their datacenter to some location where the DSL telco&#x27;s network is, so that they can interconnect (they generally are more than willing to pay for that, at least if it&#x27;s not some location where the respective telco is the only one who could provide the line and would bill unusually high rates for it) - what they are complaining about is that, essentially, even if they were to offer delivering their traffic directly to all the central offices of the telco using their own lines, so the telco only would have to connect them to the DSLs of their customer, those telcos would refuse unless they were paid for it.<p>And I am not exaggerating: There have been cases where CDNs offered to place cache servers in the telco&#x27;s network, to pay for the rack space and the power and their servers at normal hosting rates that other hosting customers would pay, so that the traffic originates as close to the subscriber as possible, thus reducing the network costs for wide-area transport by the telco as much as possible, and they refused.<p>They want to be paid for access to their customers - nobody would complain if they wanted to bill for wide-area transit at normal market rates, or even if they wanted to have the traffic delivered closer to their subscribers, as long as the content provider could choose their transit provider freely, thus buying the transit at market rates. But in practice, they want to be paid unless you installed your own DSL to their customer.<p>Also very interesting, though german only, unfortunately: <a href=""http://netzneutral.init7.net/de/situation-init7.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netzneutral.init7.net/de/situation-init7.php</a> - they report that they tried to get an offer from DTAG for direct peering, and what they got not only didn&#x27;t match what they requested, but also had progressive pricing: The more capacity they would have wanted to buy, the more they would have had to pay per unit. That is to say: a 10 Gbit interconnect would have been more than 10 times as expensive as a 1 Gbit interconnect.

But this way, any ISP that sees the same blob appearing frequently can chose to cache it automatically and quickly start saving bandwidth.<p>Also, for maximizing privacy, I think this tag should be applied by the client only (can be disabled if you want to reduce metadata leaks) when the server tells the client &quot;this particular data with identifier X can be auto-cached on the network level&quot;.

If you want to compete in the drinks market, you need to find a different vertical (sports, energy, fruit, health, etc.) and build up your own trusted brand.<p>The trust relationship with a brand is a direct and personal relationship, and people can change their idea of trust at little cost. People can choose to drink Pepsi without having to convince their friends/business associates/renters/drivers/etc to also drink Pepsi. The same is not true in a market which is built on a network of trust. If I want to rent out space in my car to people I go to the provider with the biggest trust network because that&#x27;s the biggest market. I can choose to join a new startup&#x27;s competitor network as well, but there&#x27;s little I (or the startup) can do to convince everyone else on the competitor&#x27;s network to join too. And, crucially, if the people I want to offer rides to aren&#x27;t on the competitor&#x27;s network, my participation in the network has less value.<p>> But do we really need to oversee/nationalize a social network/content aggregator such as Linkedin or Facebook?<p>It depends how comfortable we all are with the private monopolies that seem to be the outcome of the way the economics play out at the moment. If everyone is happy being a freelancer working for multiple multinational trust network monopolies, then maybe not. But if the relationship between the individual and the network are exploitative (some recent articles about the reality of driving for Uber take this line) then I can imagine people calling for some kind of regulation to break the monopoly and restore some kind of competition in the market. At least if there are multiple Uber&#x27;s operating on a shared trust network, drivers (and passengers) have some choice over where they take their business, for example.",1448892759

The rest of your life is more important than your job, IMO.  To be fair though, I&#x27;d have felt the pangs of greed that the Mojang employees felt, seeing all that money.

9649256,comment,9645948,9648253,0,0,EdSharkey,,,"I have seen this question a lot when Firebug vs. Developer Tools comes up ... for like years and years, since Developer Tools first dropped even.  Now you&#x27;ve got me curious.  Please reply with points I offer below that you HAVEN&#x27;T heard before.<p>1. Just make Find work right.  I need global find, that&#x27;s all I need.  On what corporate drone planet is it a smart idea to prepend an exclamation mark to search terms to request a global find?  Chrome makes the same mistake - The Search Company got Find wrong...  (Perhaps Chrome ain&#x27;t all that and a bag of chips!?)<p>MAKE CTRL-F DEFAULT TO GLOBAL FIND!  [Scream your favorite cuss word now if you&#x27;re with me on this!]  One strike and you&#x27;re out when you screw up something dead simple like Find!<p>I don&#x27;t need file-catalogged search results where I stoke my chin and ponder all the matches; just go to each match by jumping around directly in the source, let me hold down Enter while you cycle through the matches and source files, let me know when we wrap around the search result list with a little informative &quot;search results wrapped&quot; pop-under - how do I describe my frustration??  FIND IS VERY UNPRODUCTIVE AND OVER-ENGINEERED IN DEVELOPER TOOLS.  This is somebody&#x27;s baby, I&#x27;m sorry to whomever if he is reading this - I just think simple is the key and that&#x27;s what Firebug has going for it.  Just do me a favor and toss the whole Find as you got it into an Advanced Find dialog box and give me simple, Firebug-style, rip n&#x27; roll global find in Developer Tools, PLEASE.<p>2. I know Firebug is an opt-in extension, so they have the right to do this, but ... Firebug puts that handy bug icon on the location bar for popping open the firebug panel.  It&#x27;s nice, appeals to my lazy muscle memory!  I&#x27;m sure the Firefox Developer Edition does something similar (right??), and they wouldn&#x27;t force me to go rummage the hamburger menu for their link in that version of Firefox.  But, I&#x27;m too unmotivated to switch to that version of Firefox.  I&#x27;m far too unmotivated to customize my location bar (except to remove the new Pocket icon, gross.)  The firebug icon is beautiful, I want to click its button.<p>3. I like the tabs in firebug better than those in developer tools.  The CSS inspector is great in Firebug, always has been very productive.<p>4. Breakpoints are hinky in Firefox in general, both in Firebug and in Developer tools.  I&#x27;ve seen the JIT&#x27;er optimize away my line with a breakpoint in both environments, but in Firebug my breakpoints seem to &#x27;catch&#x27; a little better.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a lot more work done on breakpoints in the debugger in general and have breakpoints (potentially) survive refreshes (or Webpack autoreloads) where the sources or script filenames have have changed.  I suppose the debugger could achieve this linking my breakpoints to line numbers in sourcemaps rather than to the .js files themselves.  If it already works this way, then I must be doing something wrong, because I am constantly losing my breakpoints when actively developing code that I am also stepping through.<p>5. Could we just have the Firebug UI atop the Developer Tools?  Firebug has made Firefox unstable lately leading to stalls and shutdown timeouts.  I would love to see Firebug team re-skin the developer tools with their UI and throw away the firebug kernel.  The native integrations in developer tools are bound to do a much better job debugging than an extension like Firebug ever could.  I thought I heard that this was the plan for Firebug.next, and I am all for it.",1433281722

You need to open remote desktops and click windows to push the OS around. With unix you often have processes that start out being manual, and which gradually get sewn up into automation.<p>With deliberate effort, you can build automation to Windows platforms. But in unix, one guy with a clue can create vast value working with the defaults. Even on an ancient Solaris box with no compiler or extra tools installed. If you&#x27;re desperate you&#x27;ll be able to find a shell that can open a socket server or staple some awk together to get a result.<p>Windows powershell is a vision of what a shell can be that has grown up separate to the unix world. In a fair world it would be considered heavy-lifting-equipment, like bash or emacs lisp. It would be thriving. But it has lived in a straight-jacket because until now Microsoft has forced operators to to interact with it via the windows GUI.<p>MFC popups would undermine the benefits of SSH. If you&#x27;re worried about your shell hanging at a background window event, you&#x27;ll avoid using it in anger.<p>Same issue with editors. Existing editors require the GUI layer.

Our service is delivered primarily through a B2B web application targeting enterprise clients.<p>At cSubs you&#x27;ll work on large web applications for business, but help us bring a distinctly non-corporate user-focused sensibility to app design. We hold the occasionally contrary opinion that business people at work are still actual people, and we strive to make our web applications delight those people -- not just check the boxes on a corporate feature grid.<p>We care less about which specific languages you know than the fact that you have strong experience with more than one, and deep multi-year expertise with at least one. We&#x27;d love it if you have Python and CFML experience specifically, since we have a large CFML application running on the JVM using Railo/Lucee -- but we also use Python, and are planning to transition much of our architecture to Python and PostgreSQL. As an expert, you would help spearhead this effort, alongside day-to-day development.<p>Because more and more of our application logic is moving to the front end, it&#x27;s critical that you have strong JavaScript knowledge and experience. You understand the architectural case for distributing application logic among the client and server, and you&#x27;re comfortable using at least one JS framework. While we don&#x27;t need you to be an expert with SQL, our applications run primarily atop relational databases, so it&#x27;s important that you have at least intermediate knowledge of SQL. While it&#x27;s not required, it would be great if you have enterprise integration experience in areas like single sign-on and punchout.<p>You will have contact with clients and client stakeholders, so you&#x27;re comfortable joining and occasionally leading calls and meetings. You&#x27;re able to express yourself in clear and professional English, so writing effective email messages and reading, analyzing, and developing project requirements is second nature to you.<p>Interested? Contact me at developerjob@csubs.com, and please let me know in the subject line that you&#x27;re coming from the HN thread.",1433280261

Then again it largely keeps the current regime in place (which makes it a win for the NSA), and it misses out on a lot of potential improvements.  Some privacy and civil liberties organizations supported it; EFF and ACLU neither supported nor opposed it.<p>Unfortunately, more aggressive reforms -- like the Surveillance State Repeal Act -- weren&#x27;t on the table; and there was a lot of concern that the Senate would further weaken it.  So given the makeup of the House and Senate, passing the House version unmodified after a sunset was probably the best outcome.  ACLU&#x27;s Jameel Jaffer says &quot;This is the most important surveillance reform bill since 1978, and its passage is an indication that Americans are no longer willing to give the intelligence agencies a blank check.&quot;<p>While the sunset doesn&#x27;t actually have any long-term effect, IMHO it&#x27;s still symbolically important: it meant that the usual tactics of &quot;engineer a last-minute crisis&quot; didn&#x27;t work this time.  And because of Rand Paul, it&#x27;s actually going to be an issue in the GOP Presidential campaign -- which is huge.  [Sanders voted against it as well, saying it was too weak.]<p>So on the whole I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a win for reformers ... a small win, admittedly, and tinged with disappointment that even after Snowden we couldn&#x27;t do better.

We’re glad that you raised this concern, and we sincerely apologize for any confusion around our policies.<p>We are fully committed to our mission of providing universal access to the world&#x27;s best education. As such, we continue to offer free and open access to all courses. We also offer learners the option to earn Verified Certificates, which provide official recognition from Coursera and the partner institution offering the course and formally showcases their achievements. Our robust financial aid program offers full support to learners who can demonstrate that the registration fee for a Verified Certificate is beyond their financial means.<p>Coursera&#x27;s free certificates, also called Statements of Accomplishment, were designed before we made Verified Certificates available. Over time, we noticed confusion regarding the relative significance of the free certificate and the Verified Certificate. The latter is an official document, while the former is an unofficial, unverified memento of the course. We chose to phase out Statements of Accomplishment in order to better distinguish the official status of the Verified Certificate.<p>Last November, we published a blog post (<a href=""http://blog.coursera.org/post/102036391812/verified-certificates-ensure-academic-integrity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.coursera.org/post/102036391812/verified-certific...</a>) explaining the value of Verified Certificates and describing how most courses would no longer provide Statements of Accomplishment. Still, some older courses continue to offer Statements of Accomplishment, including the Child Psychology course you’ve referenced above. Understandably, that inconsistency has proven somewhat confusing.<p>We do our best to communicate changes clearly and will strive to be more transparent in our communication around such changes moving forward.

One would think that a final update could remove that &quot;coming soon&quot; box from their proprietary added-feature screen, but they haven&#x27;t even bothered to do that.<p>So I can watch NetFlix and YouTube on that device, but not Amazon instant video, or Crackle, or Crunchyroll, or Vimeo, or any of the dozens of selections available to better supported platforms.  Having learned my lesson, and aware of the increasingly stalkerish behavior of &quot;smart&quot; televisions, my next TV purchase was very specifically a dumb screen.

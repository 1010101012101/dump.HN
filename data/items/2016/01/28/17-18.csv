10989892,comment,10989413,10989719,0,0,JshWright,,,"Far more important than the parachutes is the atmosphere. Even without parachutes, the atmosphere is responsible for almost all of the deceleration the capsule experiences. The atmosphere takes it from orbital velocity (~30,000 m/s EDIT: ~8,000m/s (km/h->m/s conversion fail)) and slows it down to the terminal velocity of the capsule (~100 m/s). The capsule only has to take care of that last bit from terminal velocity down to 0 m/s.<p>On the moon, there is no atmosphere, so the capsule would have to handle all the deceleration from lunar orbital velocity (~2,000 m/s) to 0. So, in ballpark figures, you&#x27;re looking at 20 times more &#x27;delta V&#x27; (change in velocity) that the capsule would have to accomplish in order to land on the moon. It takes _way_ more fuel to manage that.",1454003961

Those who pay more in taxes than basic income gives and those who don&#x27;t.  You could effectively create a negative income tax that gives the exact same payouts as basic income.<p>x is income, b is basic income, F(x) is tax someone has to pay at x income under the basic income scheme, G(x) is the tax scheme someone has to pay out without basic income that includes some negative taxes.<p>If G(x) = F(x) - b, then x + b - F(x) = x - G(x).  Yes, they are coded up on law a bit differently, but the outcome on everyone&#x27;s pay would be the same.  All that is different is the talking points.

One of the things that makes Chicago distinctive is (unfortunately) the legacy of segregation and redlining from the 60s and 70s, which gutted whole large areas of the city. There aren&#x27;t large sections of Manhattan or Brooklyn with virtually no white residents (at least, no area as large as the Austin/Lawndale neighborhoods).

Yes, of course!” That’s all he had to tell me. It was a clue for which I got a lot of credit later, but it was his observation. A professor of theoretical physics always has to be told what to look for. He just uses his knowledge to explain the observations of the experimenters!</i><p><i>However</i>, Feynman admits at the end of his multi-chapter account of serving on the commission that Kutyna had coyly <i>played</i> Feynman:<p>> <i>Another thing I understand better now has to do with where the idea came from that cold affects the O-rings. It was General Kutyna who called me up and said, “I was working on my carburetor, and I was thinking: what is the effect of cold on the O-rings?” Well, it turns out that one of NASA’s own astronauts told him there was information, somewhere in the works of NASA, that the O-rings had no resilience whatever at low temperatures—and NASA wasn’t saying anything about it. But General Kutyna had the career of that astronaut to worry about, so the real question the General was thinking about while he was working on his carburetor was, “How can I get this information out without jeopardizing my astronaut friend?” His solution was to get the professor excited about it, and his plan worked perfectly.</i><p>If we take Feynman at his word, to me this is a great description of how science and bureaucracy and invention (and, sometimes, disaster) works: it&#x27;s not always just random eurekas, or study-real-hard-and-you&#x27;ll-figure-it-out...sometimes the information is already well-known, and obvious, but for various logistical/political/bureaucratic reasons, it isn&#x27;t immediately disseminated or explored.<p>via: Feynman, Richard P.

In 1986, the Challenger exploded for reasons traced to an O-ring losing flexibility at low temperature.  There were warning signs of a problem with the O-rings.  But preventing the Challenger disaster would have required, not attending to the problem with the O-rings, but attending to every warning sign which seemed as severe as the O-ring problem, without benefit of hindsight.  It could have been done, but it would have required a general policy much more expensive than just fixing the O-Rings.<p>>Shortly after September 11th 2001, I thought to myself, and now someone will turn up minor intelligence warnings of something-or-other, and then the hindsight will begin.  Yes, I&#x27;m sure they had some minor warnings of an al Qaeda plot, but they probably also had minor warnings of mafia activity, nuclear material for sale, and an invasion from Mars.<p>>Because we don&#x27;t see the cost of a general policy, we learn overly specific lessons.  After September 11th, the FAA prohibited box-cutters on airplanes—as if the problem had been the failure to take this particular &quot;obvious&quot; precaution.

This submission has a lead paragraph before the interview transcript that sets a lot of context: &quot;In an extraordinary move, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors last week issued a proposal to require researchers to share their clinical trial data as a condition for publication. And the researchers would also have to submit plans for how their data can be shared. The journal editors, who represent such periodicals as The New England Journal of Medicine and the Annals of Internal Medicine, believe data sharing &#x27;will help to fulfill our moral obligation to study participants, and we believe it will benefit patients, investigators, sponsors, and society.&#x27;&quot;<p>The key words there are &quot;condition for publication.&quot; If researchers can no longer publish in the major journals without an ironclad guarantee that they will share their data, the incentive to share data well improves a lot. Interestingly, the Retraction Watch group-edited blog about scientific research has a guest post today &quot;Sharing data is a good thing. But we need to consider the costs&quot;[1] by Liz Wager referring to the same proposal by medical journals, but suggesting that some other rules would be even more helpful for improving research.<p>&quot;I want to re-emphasize that I am not against data sharing. If I had a magic wand (aka unlimited funding for research and its dissemination) I would undoubtedly wave it over all research and create a system in which raw data were permanently linked to all types of report and all the report formats were linked (so that, for example, somebody reading a press release could easily check the journal article, and, if they wished, also the protocol, full study findings and raw data). But if the fairy gave me two wishes instead of a wand, I would wish for prospective trial registration and access to full trial reports for all trials before wishing for raw data.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://retractionwatch.com/2016/01/28/sharing-data-is-a-good-thing-but-we-need-to-consider-the-costs/#more-36359"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retractionwatch.com/2016/01/28/sharing-data-is-a-good...</a>",1454002689

The temperature on the X axis intermingles ambient and O-ring temperature, but they&#x27;re not the same (imagine ocean temperature vs air temperature). The vertical axis, O-ring damage, is semi-relevant, but the important question is whether the O-rings held a seal (degree of blow-by). O-ring damage probably correlates, but seems like a proxy that may be misleading.<p>* The data available in the chart was not available to the engineers at the time. There was only one previous failure (SRM 15) that led anyone to believe temperature itself was an issue. They had two valid temperature data points (SRM 15 and SRM 22), and correctly pointed out that another launch at 29 degrees was completely outside their tested range and would be inherently risky. It&#x27;s not clear to me that a scatterplot with two datapoints would be that effective.<p>Furthermore Boisjoly criticizes that Tufte presumed to judge the engineers, for the following reasons:<p>* The engineers previously recommended no launch should occur, months in advance (due to previous O-ring issues), but NASA overruled them.<p>* The engineers recommended, and their managers accepted, that the low launch temperature was outside their test database. NASA came back and requested proof that the temperature was dangerous, but the engineers could not comply, because the parameters were extreme enough that they had not tested them. They couldn&#x27;t prove a negative. The managers at Morton Thiokol and NASA then jointly overruled the engineers.<p>* The idea of putting together a chart was not something the engineers considered, because there were a variety of previous unrelated problems in O-rings (each resolved afterwards) that muddied that data, and muddies the data that Tufte presents.<p>* Tufte himself failed to research or note the pivotal information, and thus misrepresented the situation the engineers were in, and the data available, while imputing that the engineers should be held morally responsible for not presenting data they didn&#x27;t have (and then going on to present such data himself, compiled after the fact and at his own leisure, incorrectly).",1454002417

The reason? Schizophrenia isn&#x27;t a mental illness, it&#x27;s a physical illness with mental symptoms.<p>Dustin Hoffman nailed autism in &quot;Rain Man&quot;. If Mr. Hoffman appeared at a mental health clinic and performed his character, do you suppose he would be turned away by the psychiatrists as a fake?

More than that, though, it did occur to them to request the data, but they were stifled by Morton Thiokol Management (and NASA).<p>To start with, there were a variety of previous problems with the O-rings caused by variables that appear unrelated to temperature. These problems were resolved, but prevented anyone from seeing a pattern. It was only on the basis of the single data point in SRM 15 that Boisjoly requested temperature data in advance of the launch.<p>Obtaining such data was far from simple, because, as you mention, the temperature of the O-ring isn&#x27;t the same as the ambient air temperature. Thus, obtaining the data was relatively involved and required knowing many variables: time on the pad, the gradient of ambient temperature, the temperature at which testing was conducted, and so forth. For this reason, the engineers didn&#x27;t compile the data themselves (unclear what process they&#x27;d need to get the data).<p>The engineers thus requested the data in advance, but had not received it. They had precise data on only two data points (at 53 degrees and 75 degrees), so the rest of the data in the chart was compiled after the fact.<p>&quot;The data necessary for a calculation of O-ring temperatures was thus not collected all along during the shuttle history. And when Boisjoly asked for that data in September, along with much other data, any one of which might have been the crucial missing piece to explain the anomalous cause, it was not supplied. In fact, the engineers received none of the data they requested.&quot;",1454001810

I understand that the company is producing energy at X and selling it at Y where Y > X. If it is forced to buy and sell at Y, it&#x27;s losing money when compared to producing the energy themselves. The energy companies are basically being forced to subsidize the solar companies by eating away their profit margin so I understand where they&#x27;re coming from.<p>> First, NV Energy deployed its lobbyists to limit the total amount of energy homeowners and small businesses were allowed to generate to 3 percent of peak capacity for all utilities. Then it expertly argued its case before regulators, who rewrote the rules for net-metering customers. In December it scored a major win: Nevada’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) imposed rules that not only make it more expensive to go solar, but also make it uneconomical for those who’ve already signed up.<p>Instead, the solution appears to be lobbying from the energy producer to put arbitrary restrictions on the energy capacity that can be produced by solar.

These are the classes the students throw on top of an already full schedule for free credits because they know they are complete bullshit and will take zero time and effort. If I had a M.S. from Georgia Tech and actually did a degree program with other students in a class and spoke with a professor many times a week and dedicated 1-2 years of full-time study and then my alma mater started giving out MY degree for people who sit in their pajamas and copy paste answers off the Internet I&#x27;d be pretty annoyed since the thing I worked so hard for/paid for would be devalued. I think being VERY skeptical of any online degree is quite wise and students should be required to say whether their degree was in person or online when, say, applying for a job, etc.<p>Online education might be a real thing one day but it&#x27;s got miles and miles to go before anyone takes it seriously.

If you are dedicating enough resources to your job to not be fired, you are not taking your education seriously (unless your period of study far extends that of traditional students by many years). A serious degree program IS a full time job even if it&#x27;s only a few hours of week of physical in-class time.

In a recent editorial, they expressed reservations and set off a ruckus by saying that some researchers worry about ‘research parasites.’<p>>Krumholz: There are lot of people who feel the research they do is the best research. It comes across as self-serving and absurd. Science is about replicating and testing your work. We need scientists to test and investigate and provide new insights. … Remember, people may make errors and the only way to catch mistakes and make corrections is to see the data.To call people parasites who are taking advantage of existing data and using that to generate new knowledge is not parasitism. That’s synergy and building on work of others. … Anyone who holds that view is not seeing the big picture about how different people can work in different ways to help society advance.<p>There&#x27;s been a lot of anger at NEJM for this editorial, largely because it used the brazenly derogatory term &quot;research parasites,&quot; more than any other particular complaint. The same discussion happened last decade in the basic research community, as gene expression microarray studies started publishing lots of data, and no single initial publication could fully mine it.  Now that the clinical science community is encountering more of this, and information dense technologies are being used to gather data during clinical trials, the same discussion is getting rehashed.<p>Meanwhile, those whose primary research thrust is analysis of data rather than generation often have more offers to collaborate than they could ever meet.

For example, if you write a turing machine to output &quot;101&quot;, where did those numbers come from? From the way a connected series of &quot;rooms&quot; were configured in the program state space. It moves the &quot;body&quot; from room to room to remember what part of the output it&#x27;s in.<p>The tape can change, but the program state space itself never changes, only your location in the program. (If you enjoy self modifying code, you should check out John von Neumann&#x27;s 29 state cellular automata [2] and Universal Constructor [3]!)<p>I think of the rooms as being connected by magic one-way exit doors (not the helpful Sirius Cybernetics Corporation variety, which would bring too much complexity and indeterminism to this beautifully simple model). Each door is labeled with the symbols that could be on the tape, and lead to other rooms. (Or back to the same room!) When you walk through a specific door, it writes a certain symbol on the tape and moves the tape head in a certain direction. Each door has a symbol to match from the tape, a symbol to write to the tape, the direction to move the tape head, and a the next room to move into.<p>I don&#x27;t understand TECO, but I would guess that Marvin Minsky&#x27;s Universal Turing Machine TECO program used text buffers with cursors to represent the tape with the head position, the instruction table with the state register program counter.<p>By the terminology of Wikipedia&#x27;s informal description, the location of the &quot;body&quot; is the &quot;state register&quot; or program counter, pointing into the &quot;rooms&quot; or program graph represented by the &quot;finite table of instructions&quot;. [4]<p>>A state register that stores the state of the Turing machine, one of finitely many. Among these is the special start state with which the state register is initialized. These states, writes Turing, replace the &quot;state of mind&quot; a person performing computations would ordinarily be in.<p>>A finite table of instructions that, given the state(qi) the machine is currently in and the symbol(aj) it is reading on the tape (symbol currently under the head), tells the machine to do the following in sequence (for the 5-tuple models):<p>>Either erase or write a symbol (replacing aj with aj1), and then<p>>Move the head (which is described by dk and can have values: &#x27;L&#x27; for one step left or &#x27;R&#x27; for one step right or &#x27;N&#x27; for staying in the same place), and then<p>>Assume the same or a new state as prescribed (go to state qi1).<p>>In the 4-tuple models, erasing or writing a symbol (aj1) and moving the head left or right (dk) are specified as separate instructions. Specifically, the table tells the machine to (ia) erase or write a symbol or (ib) move the head left or right, and then (ii) assume the same or a new state as prescribed, but not both actions (ia) and (ib) in the same instruction. In some models, if there is no entry in the table for the current combination of symbol and state then the machine will halt; other models require all entries to be filled.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.worldofcomputing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/turingMachine.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldofcomputing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_cellular_automaton"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_cellular_automaton</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_universal_constructor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_universal_construc...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine#Informal_description"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine#Informal_descri...</a>",1454000520

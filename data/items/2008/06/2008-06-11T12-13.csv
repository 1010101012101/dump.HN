214808,comment,214783,214783,0,0,mark-t,,,"I wholly agree with the principle here, but I often find myself running up against firefox. For instance, there's this: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=341067"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=341067</a> . You'd think if that many people find a behavior unintuitive or undesirable, the developers might want to consider that there could be something to it. Of course, mom won't ever run into this because she'd have to change a preference to encounter it. It is possible to be <i>too</i> focused on casual users.",1213188717

I think the swing should get Founder status with the amount of time the little one spends swinging side to side cooing while I'm sitting next to him hacking.<p>And while I agree with many or Aaron's and James' points, the largest reason most folks don't start startups - guts.  They don't have the guts to come up with an idea, they don't have the guts to build it, they don't have the guts to follow through.  And at the core, they don't have the guts to forsake all others for their startup.  Not that a lack of these ""guts"" is any way a deficiency, as really, different strokes for different folks, but it really comes down to guts.",1213187316

Maybe you <i>do</i> know best. But I'd like to be able to switch it off (because I just don't like it) without resorting to installing an extension. Focussing on usability really should mean you let people decide for themselves what's ""awesome"" and what's just clutter.",1213186830

One of the best things about my phone was peeling it open at home, sitting with my mac, and getting it all setup.  Having to open the package and wait for someone to do it for me, is a HUGE step backwards.  I understand that this is how AT&T makes sure they're getting their cut, but still am disappointed by this step back.  But, on the bright side, used iPhones <i>may</i> hold a little value after all.  I can dream can't I?<p>BTW: Much of my surfing of HN is done on the iPhone.

A kid whose dad played quarterback in college has an easier time playing quarterback in youth football because the dad has ""been there:""  knows what it takes, how to approach it, etc.<p>For someone with parents doing shift-work or working in a bureaucracy, who grew up with no exposure to what it takes to run a business, there is a huge intellectual/emotional hurdle that is hard to see over, making it difficult to jump.",1213185889

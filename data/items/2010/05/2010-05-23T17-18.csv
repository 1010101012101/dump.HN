My first thought was to approach corporations that occupy the same space but do not have a community based following and offer them the opportunity to sponsor our project.

If you are not willing to compromise you are no different than people who support the other extreme of the ideology. We need to meet in the middle, where it helps everyone. IMO YMMV<p>Google is in a no-win situation.<p>If they had all software closed, we would have treated them the same way we think of MSFT. In their hybrid form, where some of their services/software is open-source, some of us accuse them of playing the field because at the end of the day it helps their business, which it does, both in terms of goodwill and adoption.<p>They will never make everyone happy, but I think they can do certain things to be more open. For instance, they can open-source their search engine, gmail, blogger, docs (and other closed) platforms which are a ""lite"" version of the current form. IE, they can release a google search version that is one year older than the current version google is using, than they can release a new version every-year which will be one year older than the current version.<p>They could also not release some critical aspect of the software, like pagerank algo, spam detection. Something like what reddit does now.<p>Obviously it will not make everyone (or even Stallman) happy, but it will be better than what it is now and if anyone can pull this off, Google can.",1274636652
1372642,comment,1371936,1371936,0,0,Ixiaus,,,"I can relate; I've been a lone wolf for quite sometime - I'm a bit of a social anomaly in that I don't ""fit"" into <i>any</i> one cultural category. I don't separate my life into ""personal"" and ""professional"" therefore I have (for the most part) just one persona most people see.<p>Note: I am about to give you a rather long preface with a lot of personal detail to give you an accurate picture of ""where I am"" so that my answer to your question can make more sense and (hopefully) be helpful!<p>I dance for a Salsa team, I sail, I've been on a number of survival trips, I'm an avid snowboarder, I lived and worked on a commune for six months (this was a life changing experience), I backpacked through India on a low budget for two months, I love Dubstep and the electronic music scene, and I consider myself a <i>rogue</i> intellectual.<p>Did I mention I grew up on a 6 thousand acre working ranch?<p>I dropped out of highschool in my senior year, got my GED, and tried ""college"" twice. I dropped out twice. Around that time I chose to move out and live on the commune I mentioned earlier. There were only three of us but we were active: building structures, digging trenches with a Backhoe, rebuilding the foundation of a 100 year old house, clearing forest, and building a 100% off-grid solution complete with solar panels and composting toilets.<p>The man that was the accepted foreman for the project was (still is) an amazing friend and teacher to me. He was first and foremost, a powerful intellect; he was also skilled in any number of blue-collar activities. He was the man that ironed into my head that college is not necessary, that one can instruct themselves on <i>anything</i>. He sparked my interest in programming, psychology, metaphysics, physics, mathematics, logic (as the topic), personal development, introspection, and a <i>long</i> list of other intellectual subject areas.<p>He taught me that there is never a crowd on the leading edge.<p>I've had a self-compiled curriculum for the last six years of my life since then. I am an autodidact in every sense; I've read Ovid's Metamorphoses and critically interpreted it using what I learned from Jungian Psychology (I don't read passively); I taught myself PHP, then Python, then Erlang, then Scheme, then Objective-C, and others. I've pursued Mathematics with a passionate heart (whereas in Highschool I loathed the subject), I read books on computer science, books on logic and formal reasoning, books on how to write eloquently (don't use this comment as an example though!), and outlier books that make modern day physics look like a jumbled mess.<p>Presently (since it is an American tradition) I make my money from independent contracting; but, I started out waiting tables. I then moved on to building my mom's website, to programming for an entertainment company (at $10.00 per hour), to developing for a large startup (bit of an oxymoron I know, but that's why they don't exist anymore), and a string other 9-to-5 jobs.<p><i>Note: this part may be of interest to you, as it pertains more to your question.</i><p>I got sick of 9-to-5 and decided to quit the working world so that I could focus more on my self-education and personal projects. This lead me to an eight month stint in which I did <i>only</i> that. I paid for things with passive income and lived a slim life style. Until I decided to take up contracting work and to work for myself (it's been great ever since). I also had been working on an open-source project for the last two years as well.<p>This super long comment has (more or less) lead me to the present day me. I've found solace in coworking spaces, my Salsa team, hacker meetups, and my online friends. I still have yet to find an actual cluster of intellectually deep and potent people (hackers, you could say).<p>My present idea has been what I call ""The Enclave"" as a sort of hackerspace for thinkers <i>and</i> builders to come together. A place where these people can interact without the disturbance of ""Normals"" (most fringe intellectuals have quirky personalities and strange interests), a place where they are not just ""accepted"" but ""allowed"" to be what they are, a place in which deep collaboration can occur on topics ranging from the technical to cooking and gardening to philosophy or pseudoscience.<p>This is how I get my juices flowing, not by just working on OSS or working (I do all of that), not just by starting my own little pet software project (I do that too), but by dreaming of how we might solidify the etheric space most individuated people interact in (the internet, online spaces, etc...). Hope that is at all interesting.",1274636607

Since the functionality is called ""flag"", rather than displayed as the complement to the upvoting action, it is explicitly only for objectable submissions and not because you simply disagree with something.<p>-Allows site to maintain status quo if moderators are busy/away. The site is self moderating.<p>-Allows better tools for moderators to solve problems quicker, for example they could filter submissions based on the ratio of flags to upvotes to see where their limited attention is needed.<p>-I don't think downvoting submissions with a karma prerequisite would be a major problem giving how well the comments system has worked. Set the karma requirement for flagging to same as comment downvoting could work.<p>-If you're still concerned about flag abuse of this new flag system, ""flag (#)"" would require the flagger to select a reason from a drop down-box of a limited lists of reasons that you decide are valid for flagging.

The state of the art in research is a lot more complex than the playing-it-safe state of the art in production chips.<p>That said, future HTM systems have a lot of potential, and I think we'll see them come into wider use eventually. The main problem with them seems to be that existing software ecosystems aren't written with HTM in mind, so you get pathological memory access patterns slowing things down. But with some minor enhancements to the HTM design (like a load instruction which immediately adds its destination address to the write set of a transaction) and compiler and runtime support, and a reasonable set of concurrent data structures, HTM can absolutely fly.",1274635294

The boot process is generally expected to be run off of USB flash drives because, similar to how VMware ESXi works, is typically expected to be run on systems where installation to a local disk is not only a waste of space but potentially dangerous (mounting your USB device with write wears it out faster than if it was read-only with RAMdisks mounted). I generally build my file servers so that each disk is part of the data pool and the boot device is a USB flash drive that either shipped with the computer by the OEM (HP, Dell, Cisco, etc.) or one I imaged myself and put onto the available USB port on the motherboard (not the rear or forward ports typically in server hardware for security reasons at least).<p>It comes with a lot of features in the web interface that any decent FreeBSD admin could install and manage, and many out of the box settings are optimized for situations that are common for SOHO file servers. This buys a bit of time and makes it easier for others to maintain that may not be FreeBSD gurus necessarily.<p>There are a few tunings (sysctl stuff) and customized options specific to ZFS servers that FreeNAS offers as well. For example, most ZFS users don&#x27;t have an encrypted scratch partition created on each drive in their ZFS vdevs, but FreeNAS creates them for you by default as a strong recommendation unless you explicitly turn it off with a slightly obscure setting in the web GUI.",1452869905

It&#x27;s a staple plotline in apocalyptic fiction but it seems legit for any natural disaster or major civil unrest as well.  Whether you&#x27;re stuck out in a remote location for safety or in the middle of the aftermath of a natural disaster, having a good first aid kit and a supply of medication could save the life of you or someone else in need.<p>The only bit that seems difficult (but again, this is from apocalyptic fiction so grain of salt) is that so many important medications like insulin, antibiotics, and strong painkillers can&#x27;t just be purchased at generic wholesale and kept for use or trade in major emergencies or times of real hardship.  In the stories it&#x27;s always the pharmacies that get looted first and there&#x27;s always some chapter or episode where a family member or friend is sick/injured and the characters desperately need to find antibiotics or insulin or the like.<p>I understand that this is a bit silly going from fiction but those stories are appealing because they get you to think about how you would deal with life-threatening challenges.  In a way it&#x27;s odd that we have all of these important and effective medicines but whether the emergency services and doctors are blown to smithereens, bitten by zombies, or just overwhelmed with patients after an epic earthquake/flood/eruption there&#x27;s really no way to access them without looting or black market.<p>I just know that in the event that &quot;shit hit the fan&quot; to use the prepper terminology, I&#x27;d prefer to be the guy with a case of antibiotics and painkillers stashed in the basement than the guy hoping I can get treatment at a hospital or local medic.",1452869831

10909584,comment,10907573,10909514,0,0,lmm,,,"> C++ has had to be backwards compatible for the billions of lines of code written in it. It has managed to introduce new features and safety quite well in view of this. Perhaps the rise of systems programming languages with static safety guarantees is C++ already? You don&#x27;t have to write it with &quot;old school&quot; methodology just because you can write it with old-school dangerous approaches.<p>The very definition of static safety guarantees is that the compiler enforces them, and that&#x27;s what makes them useful. C++ has great safety guarantees if written correctly - but if you can reliably write code correctly, you don&#x27;t need safety guarantees in the first place!<p>> EDIT: And I will add that C++ does have the benefit of having loads of libraries available to it, including GUI libraries and bindings which makes development a breeze.<p>There are many libraries, but the important ones have mature bindings from other languages, or at least tools for generating them (e.g. Swig). That said, using them exposes you to the safety risks of C++, so you&#x27;re often better off rewriting them (e.g. I worked on a Java project that initially used ffmpeg to handle some transcoding tasks - but as a result had to deal with bugs in ffmpeg that took down the whole JVM for particular inputs).",1452869325

SHA256 mining is extremely GPU unfriendly by design, whereas most other cryptocurrencies use scrypt which is much more applicable to the GPU model. As a result, ASIC hardware to do SHA hashes to compute blocks in bitcoin became by far the most efficient hardware to mine bitcoin, but because it is custom it requires a ton of money to fabricate. So you see hundred million dollar mining operations emerge because only they can afford the fab run on a custom PCB to do SHA256 hashes.<p>In theory, Litecoin would not have the same pandemic ASIC runaway market control problem. GPUs would still moderately competitive, and act as a counterbalance that normal users have available to them to mine. There would <i>be</i> custom scrypt hardware, certainly, but it would most likely not have the insane performance advantage over general purpose computers that SHA algorithms have.p<p>To fix bitcoin itself, you need to commoditize the hashing hardware used by the best in the industry. If everyone had access to the ASIC&#x27;s bitfury were using at reasonable prices normal people could afford, people could distribute the mining more, but as it is most of these vendors are using in house solutions that dramatically outperform off the shelf bitcoin mining hardware.",1452868793

Recently our dishwasher crapped out. I&#x27;ve already repaired it once, but this time something else broke and we decided we were done with it. So, time to buy a new one. I reckon myself to be a pretty good value shopper, but shopping for a dishwasher got to me. Knowing that there are many fewer manufacturers than brand names, I set out to find what I though was the best value. I wanted to find a good quality one that will last a long time and I wanted to pay less for it than an average consumer would. It was overwhelming, I&#x27;m sure I could have done a better job, but I had other things to do as well; I couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t make this task my primary job. In the end we just punted and bought a Miele, a fairly expensive brand with a good reputation. I&#x27;m sure that given enough time we could have saved 30% to 50% of the money we spent, but it would have taken a lot more of my time and we risked paying too much for a substandard appliance.",1452868721

Possibly 30% of the general population fits that mold.<p>Out of that if even a third went into software as a trade there would still be a shortage as software is eating the world and 10% of population cannot fill that void. Upping that numbers comes at the cost of stealing from other trades such and research, medicine and engineering thus fueling shortages in other constrained markets such as medicine.<p>This does not even account for the guy working at the local gas station who clearly is too bright to be there but under-motivated.  If you actually factored those individual out the pool of possible talent contract even more.<p>Long and short of it, there has always been a shortage and will always be a shortage until software salaries pay to attract that upper 30% away from more lucrative career paths, but doing so will further strain other upper end markets that require the same mental skill sets.<p>So how do we fix it, in my opinion medicine hold a good example. Developers who are creative by nature tend to not be good at assembly line type thinking and are very prone to meritocracy.<p>e.g. I know developer A is a good developer I will let him take this and he can get it done. Where developer B is a bad developer so I will ignore him. Meanwhile if we delineated based on ability developer B could take a lower order role say writing unit tests for A.<p>This works in medicine by having the role of doctor, nurse, medical assistant. There are roles that can be filled by people that don&#x27;t quite make the cut to be a good developer the problem is  management is not that great at delineating development roles and developers (as a generalization) don&#x27;t suffer fools very well (hell we even go thru massive amounts of effort to try to come up with BS interview trivia and code tests to filter bad developers out).<p>So what happens is we end up giving very good junior developer C the task of working with A because he has merit. But the dirty secret in the industry is given the pace of change you would be hard pressed to tell a good junior from a senior after a year on the job. So we end up wasting the juniors talent by keeping them artificially repressed in a roll that developer B could fulfill for everybody as a constant resource that provides only the skill-sets they are capable of fulfilling. then we lose that junior because he can make more money jumping ship due to his artificial deflation that does not reflect the reality of his skill set.<p>If you notice a pattern, the above is a recipe for bad developer B becoming the lead over time, as attrition takes good developers and B is promoted because he cannot find another position based on merits.",1452868046

As many of you know, in theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:<p>Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time)<p>Availability (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it succeeded or failed)<p>Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures)<p>I think that some individuals in the United States (the ones who live in large metros) prefer to optimize for Consistency and Availability by living in populous areas.  There are more firefighters, paramedics, and power company linemen ready to step up quickly to restore services in the event of an emergency.<p>People who live in rural areas in the United States are optimizing for Partition tolerance, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they expect to one day become completely independent nodes (that&#x27;s merely a stereotype), instead they anticipate that eventually a few vertexes up the graph there may be some unexpected latency, or even a network partition.<p>The prepping culture can be thought of a distributed systems protocol which enables &quot;self healing&quot; characteristics so that a temporarily cut off part of the cluster can avoid downtime just by shedding a little consistency.  (Guns help them reject corrupted messages from outside of their sub-graph during a partition, it&#x27;s a form of security isolation)<p>One could argue that large metros also have this capability just that their RAFT leader election process takes longer (gangs shooting it out) whereas rural communities have an easier time with it because there&#x27;s less chatter on the network.  Prepper communities have more caching, and they store more shards on every node. ;)<p>In Europe they have more of a monolithic architecture from what I gather although they&#x27;ve enjoyed pretty decent uptime.",1452867127

When this structure accidentally emerges its considered &quot;informal&quot;.<p>A &quot;formal&quot; hierarchy simply means a hierarchical organizational structure that&#x27;s been imposed on a group from up on high. Leaders are selected from the herd and put into a rigid position, and attempts to usurp that structure can be enforced with various measures (in modern society banishment from the group is the typical response).<p>In an informal hierarchy, because there is no imposed structure, the leaders tend to fluid and there&#x27;s no built in corrective function to reimpose an order to the herd. As a result, the &quot;leaders&quot; in an informal hierarchy tend to be those who have cultivated the most social power, usually through personality, but also through favor trading and promise making and other mechanisms.<p>Ideally formal hierarchies are supposed to be structured by the formal leaders (who also, as a formal corrective function, have a mechanism for removal and smooth transition of power) and those structures are supposed to be optimized for the good of the organization (not the group, the organization...e.g. an Army organizes to win wars not to provide safety for the members of the Army). Informal power structures <i>always</i> optimizes to try to secure power in the leaders e.g. a mob boss kills off his rivals<p>In terms of opportunity, informal hierarchies need to spend a huge amount of their time determining structure, this often means that nothing much else gets done except for activities that will help secure and define that structure and maintain it. Formal system spend far less of their time with this kind of introspection and thus frees the members up to pursue work meaningful to the organization.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, even in the presence of a formal power structure, humans will <i>still</i> form informal structures within it. However, the formal power structure can be used to break it up if it&#x27;s becoming problematic (a CEO can fire a problem employee, while no single employee can remove a CEO). Good managers understand how to use the informal structure to help the goals of the formal structure.",1452867066

It&#x27;s like the old saying about physical access to a machine - all bets are pretty much off at that point. The DVD region locking cases were more just a desperate attempt to get some legal teeth to hit people with rather than actually stop the issue. After all, once the DVDs are in the wild and the crack is live, you can&#x27;t really stop people from removing the region lock, you can just sue them after the fact.<p>With streamed content, it&#x27;s a different ball-game since the providers technically can control the delivery and experience all the way through the content. If Netflix et. al. can create a successful means of blocking VPN and proxy access, then you sure bet that the rights-holders are going to double-down on the region blocking. The rights-holders already are getting their cut from Netflix et. al., so it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re losing a huge chunk of change, and if people up and up ditch the streaming sites, that falls more in line with what the rights-holders likely want anyways.<p>I really enjoy Prime&#x27;s video selection, and from what I&#x27;ve seen with Netflix, it&#x27;s nice. I&#x27;m in Russia right now and I really wish that I could watch the shows I&#x27;ve paid for access to on Prime. But I don&#x27;t really hold any disillusionment as to where the fault lies here. The rights-holders made dozens upon dozens of distribution agreements about what can be shown where and by who, and Netflix and its kin are pretty much just stuck.<p>Hopefully they can show that their model is more profitable as a global library rather than regional libraries, and the content holders will loosen their grip.

8501391,comment,8500970,8500970,0,0,pedalpete,,,"Sadly, I found the following pieces gave Assange so little credibility that if  he had just written about the last 3rd of the article, it would seem more credible to me.<p>If a suspended employee was shopping around &quot;the location of the encrypted file, paired with the password’s whereabouts&quot; and in &quot;two weeks most intelligence agencies, contractors and middlemen would have all the cables&quot;, wouldn&#x27;t you just move the files and change the password?<p>He then goes on to say &quot;Not only had Hillary Clinton’s people known that Eric Schmidt’s partner had visited me, but they had also elected to use her [Lisa Sheilds] as a back channel.&quot; However, he never mentions who Lisa Sheilds is, just that was Schmidts &#x27;partner&#x27;.<p>I had to research it, but apparently she works for the &quot;Council on Foreign Relations&quot; <a href=""http://www.cfr.org/staff/b5862"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfr.org/staff/b5862</a> They do a horrible job explaining what they do. But I find it odd that Assange would have left out this details. Sheilds is a conduit to Clinton as well as Schmidts partner. This is an important detail.<p>&quot;While WikiLeaks had been deeply involved in publishing the inner archive of the U.S. State Department, the U.S. State Department had, in effect, snuck into the WikiLeaks command center and hit me up for a free lunch.&quot; Assange blames Google, but he was naive enough to take a meeting, not knowing who the people setting up or attending were? I find this doubtful.<p>&quot;The last forty years have seen a huge proliferation of think tanks and political NGOs whose purpose, beneath all the verbiage, is to execute political agendas by proxy.&quot; Which direction is this statement going? The state is influencing the political agenda&#x27;s of corporations? or vice versa. Was it any other way, and is this a problem as Assange seems to assume it is?<p>Google and the Council on Foreign Affairs put together a conference to &#x27;workshop technological solutions to the problem of “violent extremism.”&#x27; This sounds like a good thing to me, but Assange condescendingly and rhetorically asks &quot;What could go wrong?&quot;, ok, I&#x27;ll bite. What went wrong? Unfortunately, he never answers.<p>&quot;Google Ideas is bigger, but it follows the same game plan. Glance down the speaker lists of its annual invite-only get-togethers, such as “Crisis in a Connected World” in October 2013. Social network theorists and activists give the event a veneer of authenticity, but in truth it boasts a toxic piñata of attendees: U.S. officials, telecom magnates, security consultants, finance capitalists and foreign-policy tech vultures... &quot; Invite-only ? Really? Is this surprising for such a gathering? If so, what are the activists doing with the foreign-policy tech vultures? Who&#x27;s calling them vultures?<p>&quot;I began to think of Schmidt as a brilliant but politically hapless Californian tech billionaire who had been exploited by ... U.S. foreign-policy types&quot;. He again here is assuming that Schmidts agenda and that of US Foreign Policy are not aligned.<p>If this article didn&#x27;t have Julian Assange posted all over it, I almost think it would be more credible. What I&#x27;ve never understood about those who praise Assange (not WikiLeaks as an idea, but the way Assange runs it) is that he&#x27;s as bad as many of the actions of people reported in the leaks. He has his own political agenda, and is given a huge volume of classified information by a third party, and he then decides what of these classified information gets published and what doesn&#x27;t. What makes him the deciding factor in all of this? If you think you&#x27;re doing good publishing information that others think is classified, than publish the information. Don&#x27;t pick through it, see what you think will make headlines or embarrass people you don&#x27;t like, and publish only that which you feel is fit to press.",1414108394

8501361,comment,8497820,8500493,0,0,zackmorris,,,"You make a lot of valid points and I’m not trying to argue against them, because they do apply to today’s world.  My main concern though is:<p><i>But the more you have of something, the more its value goes down. This is supply and demand.</i><p>This is the foundation of modern economics, but remarkably it isn’t true.  A carrot is always worth the value of a carrot.  Maybe we assign it a monetary value based on scarcity, but I’m talking about the intrinsic value of stuff.  We make more and more stuff every year, but the average US citizen is not seeing his or her wealth increase.  The stuff is being hoarded in the hands of a select few, which is the end result of free market capitalism if it isn’t regulated to provide a fair playing field.  This bothers progressives to no end, but I think libertarians rather enjoy that outcome.<p>I don’t think the two ideologies will ever find common ground, so I’ve been trying to look beyond all of this and find a path to a Star Trek economy.  We’re approaching full automation within 1 or 2 decades, and the singularity no later than 3 or 4 (barring a global disaster or political interference).  Already today the US has perhaps 2-3 times more stuff than it needs.  More empty houses than homeless, for example.  The cost of food is inverted, so that resource-intensive products like meat cost less than vegetables.  Automobiles have an arbitrary value, depreciating 50% as they’re driven off a lot.  We basically waste more than most of the rest of the planet earns.  We can analyze the reasons behind this to no end, meanwhile 6 billion people are living a subsistence lifestyle that would be like slavery to us.<p>Anyway, I don’t see WinCo ever toppling Walmart.  It has more to do with regulatory capture and monopoly than quality of service though.  WinCo has a rather narrow niche and isn’t willing to do the strong-arming to have a presence in every city.  They aren’t trying to maximize profits either.  But I do think employee ownership is the next big thing.  The costs to form a business are lower than ever, and the great failure of banks to provide seed capital has caused attention to turn to pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps.  We just don’t need bosses anymore, or venture capital for that matter, which means we don’t need investors or the burden of paying dividends.<p>But it worries me that all of this emphasis on self-actualization is promoting selfishness.  The “I’ve got mine” mentality is reminiscent of the Michael Douglas Wall Street days and I find it distasteful.  I don’t trust the majority of people who’ve made it to do the right thing and give something back to the community that got them there.  So I prefer to leave it in the hands of the people and just vote for increased pay by raising taxes.  We could double taxes tomorrow and pass a moratorium on government spending and raise everyone’s income by $10,000 ($3 trillion divided by 300 million citizens) as a basic income.  In other words, most people would see an increase in income if taxes were raised.  This is counterintuitive, but what happened from roughly 1940 to 1980.  Unfortunately a basic income was not in the picture, so most of the wealth created was in the form of public works.  Now those roads, bridges, dams etc are crumbling because we’ve slashed government spending to unsustainable levels.<p>I’ve heard all of the arguments about how if we give everyone more money, inflation goes up.  That turns out to be one of the great fallacies of all time and an easy way to get people to vote against their own self-interest.  I worked at a business that charged $99/hr and paid the employees $15/hr.  Doubling everyone’s pay is more likely to mean taking $15 per employee out of the boss’s pocket than doubling prices.  This appears to be true across the board in most industries today (wages as a percentage of business overhead are lower than ever), and is an impetus behind the Occupy Wall Street movement.<p>Well, this has become completely political now and I’m probably just spinning my wheels here.  Paul Krugman is probably as divisive as, say, Milton Friedman, so I would recommend to anyone reading this far to look at the writings of someone like Noam Chomsky as a litmus test.  If we’re talking about the future, then it’s going to be more productive to think at a meta-level.  There are very basic measures of unfairness and prosperity that even a child can understand, and I think he does a good job of exploring policy ramifications through reductionism.  I don’t think either liberalism or conservatism are compatible with a post-scarcity future.",1414108075

We had a staff of four and immediately thought &quot;this is it.&quot;  They asked a lot of us in this &quot;discovery&quot; process, and I was routinely working 18 hour days, and my productivity dipped further with each day.  As I clamored to work more and therefore &quot;get more done,&quot; I ended up getting less done than ever.<p>The deal fell through but not due to not coming through for them.<p>Fast forward to last year when my wife and I had our first kid.  It&#x27;s an <i>immediate</i> hit to your flexibility.  For the first few months I felt helpless, I wanted to work all day long but I was exhausted.  The more I tried to sneak work in, the less I got done, the grumpier I was and the less time I enjoyed with my family.<p>It took months, but I realized that productivity in limited time is about efficiency and delegation.  It&#x27;s about finding what time-consuming responsibilities can be handled by others (either through charity or payment), it&#x27;s about reducing recreation (or scheduling it for a certain time).<p>I spend less time working now than I did when &quot;hustling,&quot; but I get more done.  When I sit down in the morning it is time to go.  I don&#x27;t check Facebook when I work.  I don&#x27;t go out to lunch, unless I&#x27;m meeting someone.<p>Hustling is about effort, not time invested.  Don&#x27;t fall into the trap that says you can&#x27;t beat someone with more time to spend on something, you just have to work that much smarter.<p>It&#x27;s a mistake to call it &quot;balance,&quot; it&#x27;s really about efficiency.

For someone with my priorities, your life sounds like hell--though I give you props for making the choices you are consciously--and there&#x27;s literally no amount of money which would make rearranging my priorities make sense to me.<p>Like you I will start a business someday, but when I do it will be a slower burn operating within the constraints of my personal priorities.<p>It&#x27;s challenging, but I also apply my same set of priorities in my work life. I don&#x27;t pursue or accept jobs which will require missing dinner time, which will wipe out my weekends, which will consume me and my life. Life is about so much more than work. It&#x27;s about time spent with the people you love, doing meaningful things. Someday we&#x27;ll all die, and I don&#x27;t want to look back and see just a whole shit load of hours worked (on my own businesses or for others).<p>I don&#x27;t fault you for how you&#x27;re living though. As long as it works for you, your wife, and your family, keep at it. Everyone&#x27;s different, and has different ideas of what makes a &quot;good life.&quot;<p>I will say that I personally find it frustrating how much pressure there is out there these days to work more for less. I ascribe it to too many people being willing to let work consume them and making it harder on the rest of us who would rather maintain a strict separation of work from home life, working hard for the amount of time we&#x27;ve agreed to work, but otherwise being free to spend the rest of our time as we see fit.",1414106872

The reason for this is to undermine the notion that one should even want to organize a society around happiness in the first place (undermining one of the central assumptions of nearly 2500 years of western political philosophy). To this end I think Huxley succeeds brilliantly. Furthermore he raises far deeper questions of what it means to be human in ways that Orwell simply does not address. Finally the fact that many identify his depiction of the future as dystopian is a good sign that he successfully gets readers to reevaluate their own thinking about what it means to live a fulfilling life, since I think almost all of us here would agree that the world Huxley depicts is in some ways thoroughly empty of any real fulfillment or achievement.",1414106008

That&#x27;s the cycle I&#x27;d like to break; but blaming Google solves nothing. What are they suppose to do? Just straight up say <i>&quot;Screw you USgov, we&#x27;re not obeying the law.

The more there is the danger that he might be forgotten, the more ridiculous his theories of the world.<p>However, you have to think about his target audience.  The audience doesn&#x27;t consist of people who are familiar with things like DARPA grants, and think tanks.  For people in the know, this writing will read like lunacy, because they will understand that Assange sees demons behind every innocuous shadow.  Some random college kid from middle America, on the other hand, won&#x27;t know that his writing is lunacy.<p>For example, think about his casual implication that DARPA funding of Page and Brin&#x27;s Stanford research might be a signal of their nefarious links to some cabal of elites in the defense industry.  Anyone who has worked in a top-ten engineering program knows that nothing could be further from the truth.  Those grants go out, in a bureaucratic fashion, to tons of people, without any such elites getting involved at all.  In fact the worst thing you can say about those DARPA grants is that they are haphazardly doled out for some real stupid projects.<p>But think about how that accusation looks to some kid.  It seems like there is this grand conspiracy because Larry Page and Sergey Brin took DARPA money ... of course they must be deep cover CIA implants right?<p>Its complete stupidity from start to finish, but its the type of stupidity that can only be debunked by actually being there and seeing that Assange speaks nonsense.

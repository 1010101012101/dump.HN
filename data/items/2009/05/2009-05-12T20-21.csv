If sales keep going the way they're going for the next couple years you'll have more money than you'll ever need. And you can always sell it off for a lump sum whenever you want. If you take the risk of trying to build a bigger company you could end up walking away with much less.<p>I'm definitely not opposed to sharing slices of a bigger pie, but in this case it seems unnecessary.",1242161971

In a very concise manner it lays out the traditional value proposition of journalism, and explains that with improved technology they no longer add value.<p>It doesn't proffer new ways for journalism to be relevant, so I'll take a stab it.  We need journalists to be experts that write for the non expert, those who contextualize the news and explain it's relevance to the the picture -- to provide analysis.<p>So when an event happens instead of reporting on the event, they explain how it relates to previous events and what we can expect in the future.  One site that does something like that is: www.stratfor.com which I enjoy reading.  One nice feature is that they report on whether their predictions were correct, and the reasons why.<p>This new form of journalism will require that the journalists know what they're talking about, and will most likely favor those who are experienced in a field and decide they want to make it accessible to the masses.  I doubt there is much value an inexperienced journalist can add, unless they are an investigative reporter.",1242161680

Once you've managed to get an arbitrary, suspicious-but-harmless patch accepted (which, admittedly, is quite the hurdle), you can switch one garbled section for another.  Then, you can check which version of the garbled section is in place using your actual code, and branch based on that.  There are of course obfuscated variants of this.<p>This is similar to that exploit on MD5 signatures of PDFs:  trick someone into blessing something with harmless effects, and then change part of it so that the effects become harmful.

Security is always a tradeoff with convenience. When you consider the effort required to actually perform a man in the middle attack or some other kind of attack when you install something from github versus how hard is it to just break into your house and steal the laptop you might just decide that running some code directly from github might not be such a bad idea :)<p>But more importantly, the intended usage is over a <i>secured</i> network. vpn, ssh or ssl tunnel or even <a href=""http://localhost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost</a> (serving from protected directory with some ACL). I can think of many many situations where this is just 'right'.<p>The standard capistrano/vlad way of delivering the sources is rsync or git over ssh (or even SVN over HTTP!)
How is this more secure then fetching a source over http though the same ssh tunnel (forwarded localhost, i.e. SSH -L...)?",1242161433

And for many people, myself included, acceptable commuting time in my own car, with my own radio and peace/quiet is far longer than what I'd accept on the green line subway in Boston, or waiting in the rain/snow/slush for a bus.<p>This freedom radius is particularly important when you consider that most (American anyway) families have at least two incomes, so I must choose to live where I can get to my employment and my wife to hers. With cars, at least in America, that opens up a much wider range of options than if we could only look at jobs on the subway. As it stands, we chose to live in Cambridge (a ""city suburb"" of Boston); I drive; she takes the T. Either one of us could easily change jobs to literally dozens of different employers without having to move houses or change fields. There's significant value there.<p>Naturally, had American cities evolved differently, that might also be true just by us living on a better-than-current-reality subway system, as most desirable employers would also have located near subway stops, because that would be a competitive advantage. As it stands now, companies needing white collar talent intentionally locate where there is parking and good access to ring highways, for that is a competitive advantage.<p>The network effects to overcome to make car-free living are daunting, and just because you can find a few thousand people with lifestyles perhaps overly suited to car-free living in planned communities does not mean that those communities are scalable.",1242160950

Another clever fella came along and found a way to store closures on the stack, which was super fast, except they weren't really in the stack but only pointers to them where, i.e. spaghetti stack, and it got annoying super fast. Solutions where found, and problems where found in those solutions .. then came along Appel and Shao and showed you could store closure in <i>REGISTERS</i>.

I don't know how much this reflects on Andrew and/or mailbits, but brad greenspan and euniverse are know for, among other things, 'legitimizing' the adware business, until most everyone realized it wasn't legitimate. Also euniverse and brad had a pretty well publicized accounting fraud scandal that resulted in him leaving euniverse.  Anyone that worked in the LA online advertising business during the late 90s early 00s will know euniverse is about as shady as shady can get, without actually getting thrown in jail.",1242158766

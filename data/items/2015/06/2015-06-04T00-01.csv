9656838,comment,9655846,9655846,0,0,kijin,,,"Some people interpret Arrow&#x27;s theorem to mean that democracy is a futile exercise. For example, the anarchist Robert Paul Wolff uses an argument similar to Arrow&#x27;s theorem to show that all democracies must be tyrannical to at least some of its members.<p>But Arrow&#x27;s theorem is first and foremost an exercise in logic. It is grossly oversimplified, and therefore should not be treated as realistic simulation of real-world voting systems. We should be very careful when drawing political conclusions from logical proofs.<p>There are several reasons why most contemporary political theorists don&#x27;t give a damn about Arrow&#x27;s theorem, despite its logical plausibility.<p>1) Arrow&#x27;s theorem assumes everyone&#x27;s preferences to be fixed points, and only cares about finding a curve that fits all of those points. But people&#x27;s preferences are not fixed. People are always changing their minds, often in response to the shifting preferences of others. Many political theorists in the &quot;deliberative democracy&quot; camp (the dominant model since the early 90s) argue that the whole point of a democratic discussion is to get people to reconsider their pre-existing preferences and find some sort of middle ground.<p>2) It&#x27;s not even clear why an ideal procedure would need to satisfy all of the preferences, or even most of them. If making everybody happy were as simple as designing an election procedure, we would have gotten rid of politics a long time ago! You don&#x27;t even need 3 or more preferences to arrive at a conflict. Two people with one preference each, that directly contradict each other, would be enough to produce a situation where no procedure can satisfy them all. In other words, there&#x27;s nothing new here. Time to move on.<p>3) Arrow&#x27;s theorem is somewhat effective in explaining how the actual share of seats in a lawmaking body can end up being very different from the number of votes that each party received in a first-past-the-post voting system with 3 or more major parties, such as UK and Canada. But there are much simpler, more intuitive ways to explain that.<p>All in all, Arrow&#x27;s theorem was a neat response to the political theory of the mid-20th century, when people assumed democracy to be simply a matter of efficient curve-fitting. But political theory has come a long way since then, partly in response to problems like Arrow&#x27;s theorem. In the new academic milieu, Arrow&#x27;s theorem isn&#x27;t as relevant as it used to be.<p>On the other hand, I can sort of imagine how Arrow&#x27;s theorem might find a new use in designing distributed computer systems. Since computers aren&#x27;t as fickle as human politicians, the logical conclusions of Arrow&#x27;s theorem might be more relevant there. It&#x27;s good to see that the HN thread so far focuses more on technical details than on grand, mostly irrelevant political narratives.",1433379349
9656837,comment,9654049,9655031,0,0,mahranch,,,"> Gaijin is slang. It&#x27;s not necessarily used with a derogatory meaning.<p>I think this is incredibly important here. People watch movies like Fast and the Furious and think it&#x27;s <i>always</i> a bad, derogatory word when that isn&#x27;t the case at all.<p>As with many words in our own language, context is incredibly important. Take for example, the English word &#x27;foreigner&#x27;.<p>If I see a guy struggling to read a menu at a restaurant, I may say &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s probably a foreigner. I&#x27;m going to go see if he needs help&quot;. That&#x27;s not a negative or derogatory usage. If I say &quot;I wish those dirty foreigners would just go back to their home country&quot;, I&#x27;ve now turned the word into a derogatory one.<p>This is exactly how the word gaijin is handled. It <i>can</i> be used in a derogatory manner, but it&#x27;s not inherently derogatory. It can be used in a non-derogatory way. It&#x27;s a shame so many people get their cultural knowledge from Hollywood movies.",1433379347
9656836,comment,9652105,9656303,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> Last I checked, the arms race seemed to be almost over. GPUs are only 20% faster per year, and the progress seems to be getting even slower.<p>This is what happens when you try to make too much inferences of a trend in a short time within a step function.<p>The primary ingredient that fuels continued performance growth in semiconductors, including GPUs, is process shrinks. They are fundamentally what gives AMD and nVidia the additional transistors that they can use to increase performance. The foundry 20nm processes were a bust, meaning that GPUs effectively skipped a shrink. This means that the last 3 years, after 28nm became available, the only way they have had to increase performance was slight efficiency increases and growing the chips bigger.<p>GPUs will move to next gen foundry processes, the Samsung/GlobalFoundries 14nm and TSMC 16nm late this year or early next year. This will provide the most dramatic single change in the underlying manufacturing process of the history of making GPUs. Assuming no major architectural advances, expect twice the performance.",1433379334

At any given price point Ontario reds are substantially worse than California reds.<p>Even if nothing happens, once the government starts openly negotiating to open the market the property value of vineyards will plummet.

The Hadoop project is not only a computing framework, but it&#x27;s a datacenter work scheduler (YARN), a distributed filesystem (HDFS), computing framework (MapReduce), HBase (database built on top of HDFS) and a whole host of other complimentary technologies. Admittedly, when most people say &quot;Hadoop&quot;, they refer to MapReduce. MapReduce is a batch computation framework principally for executing filtering or aggregation over large amounts of data (e.g. finding top referrers from request logs).<p>InfluxDB is a distributed timeseries database. The closest analogue in the Hadoop ecosystem would be HBase running OpenTSDB. InfluxDB is aiming to fill the niche of high-volume metric collection and analysis. A system like InfluxDB (or any other time-series storage solution) aims to observe data over time for use in dashboarding, alerting, and general analysis over time. For example, tracking pageviews per second or response times.<p>I encourage you to take a look at all these projects, they&#x27;re fantastic when you need them.",1433379075

9656706,comment,9652893,9653906,0,0,vidarh,,,"One of my pet peeves is that developers rarely understand the costs of traversing boundaries well enough to even think about them.<p>You won&#x27;t do distributed services well if you don&#x27;t understand that each step removed from in-process, in-cache carries with it a severe cost-multiplier for communicating state.<p>E.g. most developers (rightly) assume that function/method calls are usually quite cheap, but we don&#x27;t tend to be good at thinking about cache effects. So we lose the first big factor of performance by e.g. chasing pointers around.<p>Then people tend to (wrongly) assume that if function calls are cheap, this extends to system calls. Another multiplier, as people e.g. does tons of small read()&#x27;s instead of larger reads into in-process user-space buffers.<p>But I see people go further, and assume that <i>database queries</i> or <i>http requests</i> are cheap, often helped by having them hidden behind ORMs and various APIs that obscures how often they&#x27;re making these queries even if they&#x27;re logically aware they&#x27;re calling them.<p>The end result is that often these applications get written with the assumption that a function call is a function call is a function call, without thought to whether or not that function call is just a handful of machine instructions, or will trash the cache, or traverses a process boundary of hundreds of cycles before anything gets executed, or executes a remote API that may take millions of cycles to return.<p>And then something is &quot;slow&quot; and the developer in question often have only a very vague idea what is likely to be slow, and stumbles around trying to measure various parts of it without thinking about the bigger picture of what information traverses what boundaries how frequently.<p>The same concern applies to reliability tradeoffs as well as performance (e.g. lack of understanding of implications for high-availability for example).<p>I think a huge proportion of problems making effective use of distributed systems boils down to this. There are hard challenges, sure, but if you are aware that each step across a boundary carries a certain penalty, you&#x27;re already well on the way to actually <i>thinking</i> about <i>why</i> you want to move something across a boundary, and think about whether or not you understand the tradeoff well enough, and to structure things to e.g. minimize the number of boundary traversals (once you think of system calls as &quot;slow&quot; you are much more likely to entertain the idea of the slight extra complexity of ensuring you read/write as much as possible in one go, for example).<p>Even just teaching younger developers to be aware of this, and how to actually measure and profile more, would help immensely, I think (one of my favourite things to show people is just very basic crude use of &quot;strace&quot;; suddenly it becomes very obvious to a lot of people that some of the things they do are immensely inefficient). Not because it would teach them to do distributed systems right, but because it would give them the tools to recognise much earlier when they&#x27;re headed into territory they don&#x27;t know well enough yet, instead of finding out after they&#x27;ve already painted themselves into a corner.",1433376308

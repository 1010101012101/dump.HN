The wheel will actually contain an active electrically driven suspension system.  Michelin claims an <i>extremely fast response time - just 3/1000ths of a second and all pitching and rolling motions are automatically corrected</i>.  I also believe that the idea that the wheel will not be able to accelerate as quickly to be unfounded.  The same amount of weight it being rotated, as only the tire, which is roughly the same as any normal tire, is actually spinning.<p>These pictures give a far better idea of how the wheel is constructed:<p>Front - <a href=""http://servicesv2.webmichelin.com/frontnews/servlet/GetElement?elementCode=54611"" rel=""nofollow"">http://servicesv2.webmichelin.com/frontnews/servlet/GetEleme...</a><p>Back - <a href=""http://servicesv2.webmichelin.com/frontnews/servlet/GetElement?elementCode=54610"" rel=""nofollow"">http://servicesv2.webmichelin.com/frontnews/servlet/GetEleme...</a><p>I'm sure there are going to be plenty of complications with the design but it is really good to see large companies taking some initiative for innovation.

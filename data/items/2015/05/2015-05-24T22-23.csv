The timing of this post was opportune, because just yesterday I had a chance to see (again) Bob Davidson, the husband of Janice (Jan) Davidson and a leader of Davidson & Associates, at a meet-up of alumni of various Davidson Institute for Talent Development[1] programs for young people. The Math Blaster software was an early example of successful edutainment software, and it led to quite a bit of revenue that funded other software titles developed in-house or acquired over the years by Davidson & Associates.<p>Jan and Bob Davidson timed the Dot Com boom perfectly in choosing a time to leave active management of Davidson & Associates and begin funding philanthropy, which for them has been most devoted to developing programs for unusually bright young people in the United States. The best-known program of the Davidson Institute is the Davidson Fellows program,[2] which gets in the news at least once a year as new Davidson Fellowship awards are announced,[3] but the biggest program by number of young people involved is the Davidson Young Scholars program,[4] which includes several alumni and I think some current members who are active participants here on Hacker News.<p>We talk here on Hacker News about some other software entrepreneurs who get in the news a lot these days for their philanthropic efforts, but I thought I should give a shout-out to one of the early adopters of a career change to full-time philanthropy funded by a software fortune, the Davidsons, because their philanthropy has a direct influence on the Hacker News community.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.davidsongifted.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidsongifted.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.davidsongifted.org/fellows/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidsongifted.org/fellows/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.davidsongifted.org//fellows/Article/Davidson_Fellows___Class_of_2014_505.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidsongifted.org//fellows/Article/Davidson_Fell...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.davidsongifted.org/youngscholars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidsongifted.org/youngscholars/</a>",1432507789

In the US, federal financial aid will provide you with cash for living expenses.  There are several open enrollment online schools (here&#x27;s one [1]) that are cheap enough for you to wind up with about $4-$5K/semester in cash for living expenses.  It&#x27;s not alot, but you can pretty easily &quot;attend&quot; classes online part time while you try to work yourself out of your situation.  You get the &quot;credit balance refund&quot; about a month after classes start each semester, but many online colleges have &quot;semesters&quot; that start every month.<p>While not homeless, my sister came to a crossroads in her career and is now doing this exact thing.  The extra $10K/yr basically pays her rent, she is still able to work full time, and she&#x27;ll have a degree in a field she actually likes at the end.  If OP suddenly had $5K in the bank, his road to recovery wouldn&#x27;t have been nearly as rocky.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.apus.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apus.edu/</a>",1432506466

Sure, crappy software that uses more disk space, memory and CPU cycles probably requires more power, but you can't seriously believe this is a real issue. If you do, in fact, believe this nonsense then saying your priorities and efforts are misguided would be the understatement of the millenium. There are plenty more environmental issues that need to be tackled before even speculating about the power consumption of bloated software.<p>I'm still holding out hope that your comment was a joke gone awry.",1221598749

In the real world I think Tyler would have said ""Ok, I'll try and be nicer to those other folks"" during the one-on-one meeting then returned to his original behavior w/in a matter of days or weeks.<p>So, do you compromise the technical strength of the team by firing Tyler or do you compromise team unity by keeping him?<p>My thought is that this is not a simple one way or the other answer.  The post took the middle ground of talking with Tyler, which I don't think would really work out the way he wrote most of the time.

Seriously, it sounds like a bankruptcy seminar I went to. Banks trying to foreclose were getting upset when judges started to tell them to produce the title to the loan. It turns out they had repacked and sold them and never actually delivered the titles. The excuse was ""its on someone's desk somewhere."" But the laws in some states require you to bring it to court to prove you own the loan. And they couldn't, even though everyone knew who owned the loan, nobody had the piece of paper.<p>Once the Jenga pile collapses, I highly doubt people will be able to figure out who owes what to who, even though they claim to have hedges against this, that and the other.",1221598587

306272,comment,306119,306203,0,0,wensing,,,"First of all, I think tipjoy is a fantastic idea.  We initially saw tipjoy as a perfect fit and also appreciated Ivan's communication with us.<p>However, as the graph shows we ended up deciding against continued use of tipjoy as a revenue stream.  This wasn't because we were worried that we'd only ever be able to get an Amazon gift card (although I did spend a few minutes one day thinking what we could buy).  I truly believe that the tipjoy team will get the legal taken care of and allow users to withdraw cash.<p>So why did we take it down?  Ultimately there was some confusion around tipjoy's functionality and benefit ... and no, I'm not referring to the man that told us he would be passing our site on to his attorney that keeps a list of abusive web practices.  Rather, I'm referring to actual emails from users that were concerned about our financial well-being and wanted to make sure we were compensated in some more tangible, verifiable way.<p>While we don't let our users decide things outright, this turned out to be a move we don't regret, given the number of direct donations we have received (we managed to trigger a  flag inside PayPal and got a phone call).  However, I will use this opportunity to add that if the tipjoy team made a few changes (being able to change the default payment amount, not asking users to ante up $5), I think the service would be a no-brainer for many a website.",1221597416

306242,comment,304581,305991,0,0,bendotc,,,"Okay, first, I just want to thank you for your excellent response.<p>I'll admit, I don't think art must necessarily illustrate the human condition.  I think good art often does, but it can also just be something that evokes an emotion.  Of course, lots of things evoke emotions, so that's obviously necessary but not sufficient.  I agree that the expert exercise of craft can be quite enjoyable, but that too is not sufficient to be artistically interesting or else all skilled workers would be artists (and if you feel that way, we really aren't talking about the same thing when we use the word ""art"").  This is already a debatably overly-limited definition of art, but my point was to unpack the idea that art does have various motives, goals, and effects on the viewer, as well as many ways to achieve them, and that is a fine thing.<p>However, I wasn't trying to debate what is artistic and what I not.  I was saying that for those of us interested in games as art, Bioshock is an exciting game, and it's exciting because it does something new and it does it well.<p>I don't understand how you can get out of what I said that I think Bioshock's story is what makes it art.  To say ""ahh yes, but it's not a movie!"" is to miss the entire point, (which may very well be the fault of my writing).  The point is that it controlled me and I enjoyed it.  The point is that it told me I was a slave AND IT WAS RIGHT. Because of things I DID. And it did it in a way that only a game could, not a movie or a book or a song.<p>I said Bioshock was interesting and I stand by that because it did something that none of the games you've cited do: the rules of the simulation and the rules of narrative played together to make meaning that as key to the game that couldn't be made in strictly simulation or narrative forms alone.<p>You say the ""gameplay doesn't distinguish itself much,"" and if you mean the combat and other kinetic elements don't particularly stand out, I don't entirely disagree, but that's missing the point.  When you say that Bioshock's story isn't well told, however, that's something I disagree with strongly.<p>I wish I had time to discuss each of the games you listed, because we agree on some points and disagree on others, but I don't, so I'll try to address some of the themes I saw.<p>You defend some Nintendo games for being something other than literary, and you and I are in agreement that that's not required to be interesting.  Too many people think that a game has artistic merit if and only if it has a good story.  There are a whole lot of good games without a story, or with a terrible story that they tell well (e.g. Half-Life 1).  This isn't the point.<p>However, story and how it's told is important stuff in a lot of these games.  But how do games tell stories?  Like literature and movies, games have character development and pacing, but there are also aspects unique to each medium.  Literature has the craft of writing, movies have framing and mise en scene.  Games have other means of telling stories, and we're still figuring some of them out.  Bioshock tells its story and evokes something in the player in a way I haven't seen before.  That's why I said initially that it's one of the most exciting games out there.  It's exciting because it's trail-blazing.  It's exciting because it uses this to be an indictment of its own genre conventions.<p>Finally, you write, ""I think art means making fun games above everything,"" a statement that honestly makes me rather sad.  There are plenty of great things to do in terms of making fun games and finding new ways to make fun games.  However, you make the analogy of games to film: do you think Citizen Kane was a fun movie?  Should Kubrick have worried more about making Paths of Glory more fun?  I don't think fun is bad, but to limit our definition of a good game to what is fun is to put on blinders.<p>tl;dr - Good literature isn't about plot and neither is BioShock.  Good literature and BioShock, however, both use their medium well, and BioShock is exciting because it shows us a new way of doing things.",1221596393

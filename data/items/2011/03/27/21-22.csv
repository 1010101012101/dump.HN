Maybe people like to gamble and really did find this shopping model entertaining? Either way, talk of making this illegal turns my stomach. If Swoopo wants to sell this service and there are customers willing to participate, who are you to interfere?",1301259716

2375994,comment,2375633,2375633,7,0,rdtsc,,,"A couple of observations:<p>* A lot of business in Eastern Europe have recently learned the value of good customer service. Many employers require that their workers smile _and_ behave politely. When there is a choice between 2 grocery stores, I noticed my mother, would rather pay a little more and go further to the store where they are polite and smile rather than the one were they frown and throw the change back at you without even making eye contact.<p>* A lot of the perception of ""gloomy"" Soviet people come from pictures people see. I lived half of my life here and half in ex-Soviet Union. Even when I show pictures of our family having fun (usually a picnic in the woods, making kabobs, playing badminton) Americans are surprised and ask ""How come nobody is smiling? is it because life was so hard for you?"" -- now that question always makes me smile (pun intended).  They see us together obviously having fun, but because we don't smile at the camera, they assume we were suffering.<p>* I think there is often a confusion between ""smiling"" and ""acting politely"". Both are orthogonal. I think a forced smiling is a little disturbing, as it can be detected as such.  However, I would rather take a polite and courteous attitude rather than smiling.<p>* As others pointed out, smiling actually ends up affecting the mood and makes the person feel and act happier. So in this case a force smile ends up becoming a genuine smile.<p>* In some cultures (Asian I think, anyone have a reference? ) laughter and smiling can be a sign of fear. I remember hearing about groups of civilians being slaughtered because they responded with laughter at their captors (Western soldiers). That laugher was perceived as mockery which enraged the soldiers. So it seems there are multiple interpretations for smiling depending on the cultural background.",1301259676

Gorbachev's success in the West is based on the fact that he became the first Soviet leader who smiled to people in public. Many [Americans] perceived [Gorbachev] as a person who was open to communication and therefore not dangerous.</i><p>So how exactly does a smile in America ""not mean anything really"" when it allows Americans to distinguish people in their society who are open to communication from those who aren't? That's a very clear social function, full of meaning if you ask me.<p>TL;DR: in American society, smile serves two functions: (1) to express emotion of happiness/satisfaction, (2) to signify that one is ""open to communication, while in Russian society the role of smile is exclusively tied to (1). Failure to perceive the dual-purpose role of smile can lead a Russian to conclude that smile has no function at all in American society (not ""meaningful""). Similarly, failure to perceive the singular role of smile in Russian society, can lead an American to incorrectly conclude that all Russians are ""closed to communication.""",1301259659

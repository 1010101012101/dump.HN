4020240,comment,4018274,4018274,1,0,Kuiper,,,"During my lunch break, I write an email to a friend with an interest in whatever project I am working on.  This email briefly conveys what I am going to work on that evening, along with a promise to show them what Ive completed the following morning.  The lunchtime email is always brief (usually <100 words), both for the sake of sender and the recipient.  When I open my email client after arriving home from work, the first thing waiting for me is usually a brief message along the lines of ""Thats cool, looking forward to seeing the results.""  This is tremendously helpful in motivating me to begin working.<p>Besides the productivity boost I get from my accountability partner, the act of writing out the email (which condenses the scope of my work for that evening into a few sentences) focuses my attention on whatever it is I'm working on, and leaves me with something to chew on in the back of my mind when the afternoon is growing late.  By the end of the work day I'm already eager to hit the ground running.<p>Several key things regarding courtesy and etiquette displayed to email buddies: Firstly, the emails are targeted; I'm emailing people because I genuinely believe they are interested in what I'm working on.  These people can be colleagues, fellow hobbyists, and students I've mentored.  If I find myself working on a project and have no one that I feel would be interested in it, it's a sign of one of two things: either I need to expand my social network, or perhaps the thing I'm working on isnt really such a good use of my time.<p>Secondly, I don't take too much of their time.  I expect them to spend maybe 10 minutes of their attention on the correspondence, and if they spend more time than that it's because they were interested enough in what I was doing to spend more time scrutinizing it.  (It helps that my projects can usually be presented visually, with a brief series of photographs that require very little effort to digest.)  I don't spend every night working on projects, and I usually have 2-3 things that Im working on at any given time, so each person I maintain contact with gets an average of one email per week.",1337889439

My tax rate is about 15% higher than it was in CA (counting all levels of government). But, I get <i>complete</i> health insurance for that amount of money, no co-pays or deductibles or maximums or employee share of the premium or anything, <i>and</i> I get it guaranteed for life at the same price, with no way to ever be dropped, have claims denied due to pre-existing conditions, have my premiums jacked up due to getting sick, etc. (well, unless I move to another country again). Just complete, bulletproof coverage, with much less bureaucracy too (no forms to file). And I don't have to change doctors or coverage if I change jobs.<p>If I could <i>pay</i> for that kind of guaranteed-for-life coverage in the U.S., with $0 deductibles, $0 co-pays, no maximums, no reimbursement paperwork, no excluded conditions, etc., for only 15% of my income, I'd gladly do so.

(From both personal experiences as an interviewee/interviewer and the large number of posts regarding interviews that we see on HN every day). During my limited ""oldster"" interviewing experience as part of my startup job, I have found that people who have spent a long time out of academia find it (slightly) harder to solve questions on trees, graphs etc. On the other hand, they do cream the shit out of problems that you face in your day to day job in industry. On the other hand, people who are fresh out of school typically have the situation in reverse. I myself again feel the best way to evaluate a person's coding ability is to ask them to work on a tiny project.

Different sets of principles would lead you down two different paths.<p>You state your goal is to ""<i>resolve those gray areas to our mutual benefit.</i>"" If you were an investor in Eric's startup you would see that his actions did exactly that, he resolved the grey area to the benefit of the startup which mutually benefits him and the investor. If he had been living for free in AOL's facility so that he could play Diablo III all day on their fast internet connection he would be resolving the grey area to benefit <i>only himself.</i><p>So it seems that Eric's guiding principle is 'make the business successful.' And that is a good principle to invest in, but you have to consider 'at what cost.' And that is where people spend thousands of hours in business ethics classes. A typical ethics class might raise the question ""Who was harmed?"" and how. And the other party here is AOL, so it is up to AOL to determine how they would calculate the harm here. They could use a metric of ""What would be different if this hadn't happened?"" Would their network bill have changed? Would their food bill? Water bill? Since I've got visibility in to the way these things are costed I can tell you that no, there was probably zero difference in AOL's overall costs with Eric living there and had he not lived there. There was however potential liability on two counts, one the zoning laws don't allow for people to live in buildings zoned for commerce/industrial so AOL has a legal obligation to stop it when they find it, and two there is some injury liability if Eric managed to injure himself while living there. Some of that would be covered by their blanket policy on their facilities with respect to 'guests' and some they could be on the hook for if it could be proven that they knew he was living there and had done nothing about it. Since they clearly acted as soon as they became suspicious he was living there I don't think they incurred any legal liability at all.<p>Now Eric <i>could</i> use a similar line of reasoning to rationalize his action, I don't know one way or the other. I am just looking at the facts we know and observing what was at stake.<p>From a business perspective, if you have a potential partner who is focused on making the business successful you can be pretty sure they will resolve questions to your mutual benefit. On the other hand if they tend to resolve those questions to their personal benefit, without regard to the impact on the business then I agree they are not worth doing business with.",1337888822

Been wondering more about this process ever since I noticed, sometime in January, that Rust (a nascent language with very little use yet) was ranked in the low-20s for language popularity. The problem likely had to do with how the Rust devs registered their language with Github's Linguist[1] project; Rust's units of compilation (""crates"") have the .rc extension, and Github must have taken this to mean that <i>every</i> project with a .rc file (notably many Android-specific projects) contained Rust code. The Rust devs have since revoked that association from Linguist[2], but since Github takes a while to reevaluate a project's language breakdown, the language's popularity ranking on Github is still artificially inflated (sitting at #31 at the moment).<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/github/linguist"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/github/linguist</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/1512"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/1512</a>",1337888320

Rather, I was arguing that your argument does not support your conclusion.<p>With that said, I think it may be reasonable to say ""You may be able to recover from a missing file, but no one can help you if this pointer is null."" It's the difference between a logic error in the program (null pointer exception, array out of bounds exception) and configuration errors (missing file, lost connection). Checked exceptions are typically explicitly thrown by the called function; unchecked exceptions are typically encountered because the called function itself had an error. In other words, checked exceptions are when the called function recognizes an error, and throws it up to its caller.<p>So, I am able to distinguish them myself. But I'd still rather not have checked exceptions. The mentality of ""acknowledge all errors"" makes more sense in the error-code model, as seen in C programs. In that case, if you don't at least check for and report all possible errors that can arise from calling a function, then they will <i>never</i> get reported, and your program will silently be wrong.",1337887694

Start a business that has the potential to generate a large amount of income quickly with low startup costs and be sold as equity for a high price after some time. Fail, and repeat for the next two years. Hopefully at some point you will get cash flow positive and will not be forced back into the rat race. If you've played your cards right your incoming cash flows will largely be passive, leaving you the freedom to expand into new areas in the quest for high growth. One can imagine that after 5 years of being out of the rat race, you will end up stumbling upon a high growth business that can start bringing in serious cash.<p>After 5 years of effort you will hopefully have $1-5m. You almost certainly will have more than the $250k you started with. Provided you have been smart and not increased your standard of living as you earn this money plug it into safe, income generating investments like bonds, CEFs, and dividend value stocks.<p>Congratulations, you can now kill off any income streams you may have had that were taking up time (and were not passive) and can decide if you want to live on the interest or continue searching for more growth, to get you to that $10m point where the interest starts being ""I think I will buy a new car today"" levels.

A good JS/frontend guy should need at least one or rather two weeks? Please tell us how many people did this gem of a presentation in how many days .<p>- The pitch deck is basically an evolutioneverytime you meet a VC, an angel or whoever the deck gets better due to their feedbackafter 2-3 months it's perfect. This means that you need some good presentation software where you can quickly add and change content all the time (nowadays it's Keynote which is both fast and makes stylish presentation with ease).<p>- And my last point (which is a matter of taste): if you go public with your pitch deck, you are public and the surprise effect if you approach VCs after you went stealth for months is gone. I think latter is pretty important, when something is public, everybody knows it, incentives are smaller to make intros and get angel/advisory shares and finally you have also the risk that you don't get funded and the pitch quickly wears off (in your case with your stats I wouldn't worry but still for startups in earlier stages this may be not the right path; anyway I am wondering that you did this presentation because your stats are so incredibly good and skyrocketing that you'd need only this one stats chart attached to your an email).<p>So, isn't it better to spend time and effort instead for a great parallax HTML JS page landing page for the actual users of your site??<p>Or you just want to put a VC who you currently talk to under pressure to get a better valuation (by getting more leads and offers).",1337886799

Other employees no doubt sleep there on occasion and that it also tacitly allowed. Therefore non-theft.<p>I would reason to the 'theft' conclusion that AOL provides services to incubators and to employees but does not explicitly extend employee benefits to incubator attendees. Using services and consumables that are provided to AOL employees is outside the scope of services offered to incubator participants. Therefore Theft.<p>Eric was aware of this grey area, clearly trying to stay outside the regular patrol of security, and thus actively trying to not force a resolution on the question of allowed or not allowed. His response when the resolution occurred appears to be 100% compliance.<p>If I were considering investing in Eric's activities I would consider both parts of that story, the first where he exploits a grey area and the second how he responds to being discovered.<p>In my experience it is people who take Eric's approach of interpreting grey areas in the most optimistic way until shown otherwise, and being 100% rule following on explicit rulings, are successful. There are thresholds of course, if there were signs that said ""No one is allowed to sleep in this facility"" or ""At no time will anyone spend more than 12 out of 24 hrs in a day in this facility"" or even more general guidelines that define a standard for defining 'living on site' and a express a prohibition against it. Something which might say ""You would be considered to be living here if you spend more than 100 hrs a week or do more than 3 loads of laundry or sleep more than 12 hrs a week or eat more than 12 nominal meals at the facility"" etc. AOL <i>could</i> call it out, but they haven't. And that leaves it open to interpretation.<p>In the business world that is sometimes called 'moxie' or 'stones' or any number of euphemisms and its generally respected.<p>What is not respected is explicit exploitation. So for example when I worked at Google the mini-kitchens all had refrigerators that were full of beverages. A small number of employees were found to be exploiting this 'perk'. An example of that which was given was an employee that prior to the weekend, would take an empty back pack and fill it with anywhere from 20 to 50 beverages to take home. That was 'theft' in the sense that the intention was for the beverages to be enjoyed <i>at work</i> not at home, even if you were working from home. But it was theft because of the <i>quantity</i> not because of the <i>taking</i>. Taking one beverage to drink while riding the shuttle home? Not a problem although you were not 'technically' at work any more.<p>I think Eric intentionally interpreted the situation in a way that would support his actions, and recognized that those actions might not be completely inline with the intent, and waited for AOL to express its intent. I don't think he ever believed AOL would 'endorse' his living on campus while he worked on his startup (incubator participation not withstanding) but I could see a case for it being an open question if not explicitly disallowed.",1337886637

If my living expenses are covered, it costs me $0 in additional spending to do a lot of the kind of productive stuff I would like to work on if I had more spare time.<p>For example, I have 4-5 open-source projects that I would love to contribute to, and several ideas for projects I'd like to start/maintain. That doesn't cost much. There's even quite a bit of research you can do without much money. Obviously some takes money (e.g. maintaining a chemistry lab or HPC cluster), but lots of math, CS, and humanities research takes little budget; just time, energy, and access to a university library.<p>If anything, I find it a lot easier to think of ways to spend money on leisure than on work. It might be cool to travel to a lot of places, stay at nice hotels, etc. But that isn't advancing the productive part of my life goals; that'd just be a nice-to-do vacation break.

You might still come out ahead, depending on your constraints, but it isn't clear cut.<p>When you're running 1000 servers instead of the 100 you could have, that's easily a couple of million dollars, which is disastrous for many projects -- and yet, I get labeled ""old fart"" for not embracing hadoop.<p>edit: minor edits",1337886298

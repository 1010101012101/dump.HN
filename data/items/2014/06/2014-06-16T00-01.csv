So there are design choices: choices of standard functions like &quot;car&quot;, &quot;cdr&quot;, &quot;set&quot; – and what kind of scoping &quot;set&quot; implements. The Common Lisp and Scheme specs are literally lists of design choices.",1402880398

But the cost of that education is crazy now. Your parents have to among the fortunate to afford it.<p>Not really. That&#x27;s a pernicious myth. The elite universities have amazing financial aid which actually makes it easiest to attend for those who can least afford it. The hurdle is getting in, which by definition is impossible for the vast majority of Americans.<p>Not that any of this matters. The continued success of the elite is irrelevant to the continued struggles of the 99.5%.",1402880371

Schultz, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. “I believe it will lower attrition, it’ll increase performance, it’ll attract and retain better people.”</i><p>This is pretty good long-term thinking on Starbucks&#x27; part...On one-hand, there&#x27;s the obvious cost...on the other, I imagine that a significant number of the best, too-qualified-to-be-just-a-barista baristas leave after two or so years, anyway. Now that there&#x27;s an extra benefit to joining Starbucks, SB could conceivably attract a higher number of higher-quality non-careerists without a substantially greater attrition in workforce loss.<p>Besides the cost, another downside for Starbucks is that, OK, maybe your part-time studying baristas won&#x27;t be so on-task...Maybe, but I doubt it. High-achievers stuck in mundane jobs may not perform to their potential...but these aren&#x27;t people &quot;stuck&quot; as being bariatas.

If you run the system enough to heat the house and provide hot water, then any electricity it makes is effectively at 100% efficiency. This can easily make a lot of sense in cold places.<p>Commercial natural gas electrical generation facilities are about 35% efficient. It is probably inappropriate to consider transmission losses since natural gas power plants tend to be located in areas of high consumption, but that 35% only goes down on the way to the end user. Remember, it doesn&#x27;t have to beat the utilities for it to make sense.<p>Consider a house with a $200/month natural gas bill for heating. At $1/therm that is 200 therms of gas. Let&#x27;s just guess at around 10% efficient for these cells, 220 therms of gas would give us our 200 therms of heat plus 20 therms of electricity which we convert to kilowatt hours, about 600 kilowatt hours. At $0.12 per kwHr that gets us about $72 of electricity for $20 in gas.

7896829,comment,7895268,7895894,2,0,waps,,,"> Consider Lisp as a potential pinnacle of perfection. Paul Graham quipped that Lisp was &quot;discovered&quot; by John McCarthy, rather than invented or designed – Lisp already existed in the way that mathematical truths exist. That&#x27;s a cute idea, but clearly not literally true. There were still a lot of design choices – parentheses for example. Why not square or curly brackets? Why not indentation? There were also choices that are now almost universally recognized as mistakes. Dynamic scoping, for example, which was later replaced by lexical scoping in Scheme.<p>Well, have you seen lambda calculus, which predates lisp ? That&#x27;s basically lisp (it has lambda, it has bound and unbound variables, it has let, it has steps, it has recursion, ...). All John McCarthy did was implement it. That&#x27;s where the parentheses come from, of course. Why not curly brackets or indentation ? Because in maths, parantheses specify sequence of calculation, curly brackets denote collections, and indentation doesn&#x27;t mean anything. Since the concept being expressed is the sequence, they used parentheses. In fact the first reference I can find to parentheses dates from the ancient Greeks (and they were probably merely the first one to write it down).<p>Lambda calculus is a generalization of mathematical formulas by Alonzo Church to describe computation (as opposed to &quot;just&quot; values or functions, what normal mathematical formulae do. Functions in math are very, very different from functions in lambda calculus. This cannot be said to be very original either, as is was mostly a way to introduce some sanity into Hilbert&#x27;s &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; (&quot;can you give a mathematical formula that solves mathematical formulae&quot;), and more generally, into constructivism. This was made possible by finding a consistent way to express the combination operators in logic. Constructivism was a branch of logic that ...<p>You can keep going back for quite a while, but the point is that the form of lisp was effectively decided by someone who&#x27;s name we don&#x27;t even know, who lived in one of the ancient Greek city states. He (or she ? not impossible in that period) also had absolutely no idea what they were doing either.",1402877920

Pretty much the only way to get a law off the books is to intentionally break it and then build enough popular support during the ensuing test case that you can either get a court to strike it down or a lawmaker to introduce a bill to repeal it.  So people who break these laws are <i>sometimes</i> (not always) performing an essential service by forcing society to re-examine the rules it governs itself by and determining whether they still serve the public interest.  And you don&#x27;t know whether they&#x27;re heroes (think Rosa Parks, the Boston Tea Party, or Sony Betamax) or demons (think Napster or the Unabomber) until public opinion comes down one way or the other.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting how people&#x27;s reaction to this seems to illustrate Lawrence Kohlberg&#x27;s Stages of Moral Reasoning quite sharply:<p>Stage 1 (avoiding punishment): &quot;AirBnB is fine because it&#x27;s very unlikely that people will get caught or prosecuted&quot; or &quot;I won&#x27;t use AirBnB because I&#x27;m afraid of getting sued or fined.&quot;<p>Stage 2 (self-interest): &quot;AirBnB is a good thing because it lets me rent out a resource I already have and make extra cash.&quot;<p>Stage 3 (social approval): &quot;AirBnB is fine because all my friends use it.&quot;<p>Stage 4 (law & order): &quot;AirBnB is a plague upon this earth because their business model involves nothing more than systematically breaking laws and profiting from it.&quot;<p>Stage 5 (contracts): &quot;People have a right to freely enter into contracts to mutually benefit themselves.  AirBnB facilitates these contracts, and therefore is beneficial to society.  It is the individual&#x27;s responsibility to respect contracts they have already entered into with other parties.&quot;<p>Stage 6 (justice & universal moral principles): &quot;If I were a host, I would appreciate being able to make extra cash by renting out my place.  If I were a guest, I would appreciate the extra housing options.  However, if I were a neighbor of a host, I would not appreciate the extra foot traffic and possibilities for damage or altercations.  In many cases in today&#x27;s economy, hosts are strapped for cash, and AirBnB may be their sole source of income.  A host&#x27;s right to make a living and not starve outweighs a neighbor&#x27;s right to peace and quiet, and so the right choice is to legalize AirBnB but with regulations that can protect the rights of neighbors to the greatest extent possible.&quot;",1402876866

And anyone who stands up and suggests that maybe a bit of deregulation might be a good idea is branded as someone who is inevitably &#x27;a danger to children/way of life/jobs/etc&#x27;<p>So we have a situation where people gladly partake of services which innovate around regulations (usually because it relieves the consumer of the cost of those regulations) yet feel the need to keep returning politicians who promise to create more regulations.<p>The only explanation I have is that most voters think the cost-burden of regulations will always fall on another voter, and that the benefits will flow to them.",1402876820

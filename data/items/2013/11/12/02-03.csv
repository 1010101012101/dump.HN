Force pushing is literally the <i>only</i> operation you can do via git protocols that have a destructive effect on the remote repo. Moreover, it is generally considered best a practice <i>never</i> to force push public branches. Thus, preventing forced pushes on branches that are considered public would, in fact, prevent any sort of real destruction to a repo. People could still push new garbage to it, but they can&#x27;t make old history inaccessible.",1384225173

6715579,comment,6712717,6715360,13,0,rayiner,,,"> I don&#x27;t think you want to be replicating the management practices of major law firms, which are generously considered awful places to work.<p>Law firms are generally considered awful places to work because they&#x27;re in a service business where people are compensated, in part, on their ability to respond to client requests at 2 am. But that aside, there are a lot of very sensible management practices in law firms, that have arisen through more than a century of practical experience in a &quot;knowledge worker&quot; field where employee performance is not easily quantified.<p>It&#x27;s in vogue to criticize law firm management for problems that are properly attributed to the structural dynamics of the industry (slowing growth in demand), but I&#x27;ve never found such criticism convincing. Indeed, I think a lot of the historical conditions that led to the current management practices of law firms are similar to the conditions faced by top technology companies today. Google and Facebook don&#x27;t need to figure out how to get adequate performance from large numbers of mediocre people, like Big Corps often do. Rather, they are in a position where they have plenty of money to hire the top talent, but face an experience shortage. How Cravath, and others, responded to the similar situation in the early 20th century was institutionalized training, lockstep, and &quot;up or out&quot; combined with a substantial equity carrot. Instead of searching high and low for experienced professionals, Cravath hired them right out of school and taught them everything they needed to know. They kept people moving up within the organization, and offered a very real chance for substantial equity in the firm.[1] Those that didn&#x27;t quite cut it were pushed out, but to a soft landing because the industry as a whole was growing and there was very high demand at other organizations for people with that brand name and that training. Those conditions don&#x27;t really hold true for law firms today, but seem very similar to me to the conditions faced by Google, Facebook, etc.<p>Incidentally, I think Fog Creek&#x27;s system is great, and is practically quite similar to lockstep: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000038.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000038.html</a>. There are essentially just four levels (9-12) for engineers who are neither interns nor fellows, and compensation is fixed, and public, at each level (except for a small percentage of each level that might get &quot;superstar&quot; status and compensation halfway to the next level). There are no individual bonuses, just profit-sharing bonuses that are based on company performance and also fixed at each level. Promotion between levels is based on a holistic analysis rather than strictly seniority, but that&#x27;s probably a useful tweak to lockstep.<p>> Lockstep bonuses only apply to associates<p>Quite a few New York firms are still lockstep throughout the partnership. When firms abandon lockstep, its because of profitability: only a handful of firms are so profitable that they can compete for rainmakers while maintaining a lockstep regime. Since were talking about Google, Facebook, etc, in this thread, I don&#x27;t think that constraint is relevant.<p>> and are usually a function of the senior attorneys&#x27; inability to provide meaningful feedback and performance management, not a desire to reduce competition.<p>Senior attorneys aren&#x27;t great at providing feedback, but at least they see your work product, day in and day out. Engineering managers usually aren&#x27;t reviewing and editing every line of code you commit!<p>I&#x27;ve worked as a software developer and also as a lawyer at a pure lockstep firm, and I preferred the management experience at the latter. The major things I appreciated were the flat management hierarchy and the strict separation between lawyers and non-lawyers. On even a big matter, there was maybe two to three levels above me. That was about the depth of the management hierarchy at the startup I worked for, which was 1/30th the size. And from screening interview to exit interview, I was never evaluated by a non-lawyer. HR was strictly for logistical support, not evaluation. And at the firm, even when feedback was weak, it was always from someone who had actually seen my work product, not some manager who heard from someone else about my work product. When I was at a software company, I spent a lot of time doing image management: making sure that someone important knew what I was up to. It was effective when it came to bonuses and raises, but it probably wasn&#x27;t the most productive team dynamic. At the firm this wasn&#x27;t even a concern. The partner on my matter saw my e-mails and often saw my work product. The only thing an administrative person tracked was my overall hours, and all I really worried about other than doing good work was making sure I kept my hours within the acceptable range.<p>[1] Even today, when partnership odds are considered a long-shot, a new hire at Cravath has a much better shot of becoming partner than a new Googler does of achieving a high VP-rank. This is at least partly because of eschewing the idea of hiring VP&#x27;s from a separate class of professional managers rather than by promoting from within the technical ranks. This equity carrot is key to getting smart people to put in a lot of work for the benefit of the company.",1384225092

The grandparent mentioned how his curriculum offered poor training -- not all schools are so inept.<p>Incidentally... I&#x27;m a hardware engineer. I built large mobile manipulating robots during gradschool, and I routinely build electronics projects at home.  I&#x27;m well aware of &quot;hardware problems&quot; (and software bugs that cause real physical damage).<p>To address your comment: learning how to do the fabrication and hardware debugging yourself is a key part of engineering physical goods. Digital fabrication is nice, but it&#x27;s not the end-all be-all.  For robot fabrication, you can&#x27;t beat cardboard prototyping, 3D printers, laser cutters, drill press, and table saws.  For circuit boards, I routinely use a hot-air rework, exacto knifes (to cut traces), and header breakouts for debugging.  Nothing ever works the first time.  That&#x27;s why you learn how to design in a way that facilitates debugging. (All of this is so much more approachable with neighborhood hackerspaces / TechShops.)<p>EDIT: I have no idea how students of &quot;big&quot; engineering go about getting hands-on experience.

I&#x27;ve seen thermocouples rated to 1100C catch fire when they hit 600C. Designing a new part for a new idea for a mechanical subsystem can take weeks to make, cost $1000+ easily, and might not work due to very easy to make errors.<p>So maybe the way to say it is that the abstraction barriers put around non-software parts of a system make them appear less complex, but what we&#x27;re really saying is that the complexity inside of the box that we&#x27;re dealing with is smaller.",1384224281

Like the author alluded to, I DON&#x27;T think software is easy and hardware is &#x27;medium&#x27; difficulty. Just my .02, hardware is expensive in terms of design, develop, test & iterate when compared to software development at the university level. From my experience, if you&#x27;re studying mechanical/aero/civil/mechatronics/or similar fields, get involved in a student project / organization (as some one else has already commented) that culminates in the manufacturing of some doodad (plane, car, bridge, canoe, rocket, etc). Not only does it look good and sound good when interviewing for internships, it&#x27;s actually really good experience to have if you decide to go and work at a large engineering firm after your studies (where they don&#x27;t let the new young guy design the new rocket engine, for example); and having that bit of experience from designing your gizmo and then seeing it explode/rupture/sink when put in to practice is a valuable lesson learned to recall when you&#x27;re designing a part for a large corporation. And as far as the universities I have attended, it is true and unfortunate that a lot of universities MAINLY focus on analytical work (undeniably necessary, but not sufficient).<p>-currently working in the aerospace industry",1384223999

Choices like fuel/oxidizer composition, stage design, and nozzle type can be (relatively) easily specified no matter how much trouble went into deciding between alternatives. Pages of physics calculations and days of simulation bake down into a few numerical parameters in the final design.<p>I think what&#x27;s happening here is that you know and respect the amount of effort that goes into rocketry and your mind is inferring a level of complexity that matches. Effort(times)skill is one correct way to judge the magnitude of a project, but I argue that complexity of the product bears little relation to either effort(times)skill or the project&#x27;s success.<p>Rocketry was a bad example because the scale of a typical rocketry project is so large that dividing by cost (or effort(times)skill) becomes critical to making the comparison.",1384223998

In 2 months, if the bitcoin difficulty keeps growning at a steady pace (which is improbably, it probably keep growing exponentially), the break-even will be closer to 2 months.

People generally assumed that information assurance was at least as important to the NSA as signals intelligence and pointed to things like DES (which the NSA strengthened) as evidence.<p>Why would people have assumed that after the failure to enforce Clipper chip usage, that NSA would have simply given up on getting access to the plaintext of messages? That makes no sense whatsoever; NSA has been breaking codes (not merely wiretapping) since NSA has been around, just like it has long been an open secret (if unacknowledged publically) that NSA hacks into specific systems if they can.<p>It is true that COMSEC <i>is</i> a core function of NSA, but that is not inconsistent with NSA performing targeted SIGINT or general cryptanalysis. If their codebreakers <i>can</i> break into equipment used by the US government or major commercial interests then so can foreign entities, and therefore NSA needs to try anyways, even if we&#x27;re talking about &quot;pure&quot; information assurance.<p>Likewise the history of NSA has shown them before to be willing to give people cryptosystems that are strong against everyone <i>but</i> the NSA.

But when the market changes, top performers flee because they realize they can make a lot more money someplace else, and that they&#x27;ll never hit their goals until the company gets rid of the stragglers at the bottom and stops settling for mediocrity among everyone else.",1384221971

10288033,comment,10287913,10287913,0,0,api,,,"In modern terms I think you could make this critique from a perspective of learning theory and combinatorics. Methodological monism implies that the fitness landscape being explored by science is &quot;well behaved&quot; and can be traversed using a simple stepwise or gradient descent function. We have no reason to believe this, and many reasons to believe that &quot;unjustified leaps&quot; and other heresies may be required to escape local maxima or traverse unconnected regions of state space.<p>There is probably no deterministic &quot;for(;;) { do X }&quot; formula for learning in complex real-world domains. You could make an anthropic argument here: if there were, life and intelligence would not exist since whatever thermodynamically-favored auto-catalytic processes life does could be replaced by non-living systems of lower entropy and higher probability. The existence of life as the chaotic, ever-changing, evolving system that it is is itself evidence for the non-closed-form nature of evolutionary learning.<p>I&#x27;ve thought for some time that the slow down in &quot;fundamental invention&quot; that some have observed since roughly the late 1960s to early 1970s is the result of &quot;scientific fundamentalism&quot; and Skepticism. Look into the backgrounds and thoughts of people like Einstein, Tesla, Engelbart, Turing, Edison, or Schrodinger, and you generally will not find them to be fundamentalist-positivist Skeptics.<p>It seems like the general intellectual trend from roughly 1970 until maybe 2010 or so was the rise of fundamentalism of every kind, both religious and secular... maybe due to an emotional desire for the comfort of absolute certainty in the face of rapid dislocating change.<p>There also seems to be an economic drive to commoditize humans. If learning can be completely systematized, then science can be rendered into an assembly line process that can be run by bureaucracies, scaled as needed, and in which individual workers can be treated as a &#x27;human resource&#x27; commodity. Bureaucracies cannot deal with multi-modality, unpredictable and eccentric &#x27;genius,&#x27; etc., so to admit that these things are required for the progress of science is to admit that bureaucracies are inherently limited.<p>Of course this being startup central, we all know this. If learning could be systematized and bureaucratized, there would be no startups. Big companies, VC funds, and banks would just execute whatever deterministic steps are required to yield progress and maintain 100% ownership of everything.",1443390333

Turns out after digging into the code I found the path selection algorithm is not a consistent hash of a packet header tuple but rather pseudo-randomly chosen.<p>In older kernels there was a route cache so a path would be chosen and cached and so you would get a stable ECMP route per source. The route cache was removed so now the random selection runs on every packet leading to unstable routing.<p>It seems a simple fix of choosing the right hash function and maybe adding some configuration flags to determine which fields are hashes on (typically 5-tuple SrcIP, DstIP, Ip Protocol, TCP Src Port, TCP Dst Port).<p>But what would be incredibly cool is if my patch could one day possibly even merge to mainline.

Also consider the private groups on Facebook, they could be sharing paid subscriptions and who would know?<p>The idea isn&#x27;t just about Facebook, but publishing anything to get more subscribers. If your posts are time-sensitive and people can get your info through social media (without delay) then you&#x27;re probably losing traffic, because people are busy, lazy, whatever--they&#x27;re often already on Facebook and need a reason to go somewhere else.<p>Paid subscriptions aren&#x27;t as common, and I almost deleted that part of my comment, but people do pay for time-sensitive info. As far as the &quot;paid tier&quot; I was thinking out loud, in terms of building a general purpose SAS app for publishers. I haven&#x27;t nailed down exactly how it would work, to delay posts to social media. Obviously it would need compelling case studies where people increased traffic and subscribers, and revenue. I can think of a couple of markets to start with, but not getting more specific than that.<p>Another aspect of this is the notifications. I think email notifications are good to start with because they show up on your phone, and if those notifications are customizable and targeted, that&#x27;s convenient. But I think there&#x27;s more you could do with notifications, so that people aren&#x27;t annoyed that they have to go to your website to find the (timely) information they want.

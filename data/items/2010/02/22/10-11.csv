There's nothing like a coding session til the early morning hours! For me it's really difficult to stop in the midst of an unfinished coding task. :)<p>I have another advice, although it has <i>indirectly</i> something to do with the wake up process: Assumed you can make it to the shower, try to take a James Bond Shower (<a href=""http://artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a...</a>).

1142369,comment,1142305,1142305,0,0,_delirium,,,"This feels a little too gold-buggish for me in parts. Fiat money and fractional-reserve banking are quite separate things: fractional-reserve banking was common even with gold currency. Unless an intrusive government regulation outlaws people from accepting deposits and lending them back out, and even further, from issuing promissory notes, it will continue to happen even in a gold-standard economy, because full-reserve banks are less attractive, both to owners and depositors, <i>except</i> in crises, of which our memories are short.<p>Gold supply also has over the past 100 years or so inflated at a low exponential curve that looks much like a compounding curve, because the annual production has been increasing roughly in line with the total amount in existence (from 400 tons/yr in 1900 to 2500 tons/yr today). It's compounding with a low rate, around 1%-2% over most of that period, but nonethless the money supply inflates, and continues to inflate faster in absolute terms year to year (with some dips now and then).",1266833833

That was really cool, I'd be curious to read all their findings.<p>But the themes they chose seem to be more informed by stereotypes.  Vet Surgery!  Hairdressing Salon!  Horseies!  Surely for true role-playing they should be giving alternative roles.  Default offices are great play spaces.  You can play with secretarial works OR CEO stuff.  What's wrong with Computer labs or Retail?  They're all fairly genderless, flexible environments, but instead the sets seem to be firmly targeting the stereotypes.  I half expect the bigger set to be a castle, or maybe a day-care.<p>Perhaps we've (the social we) selected stereotypes that express themselves naturally, or are re-enforced strongly, or perhaps the designers took the research as a challenge but added all the themes themselves.  Maybe, too, they're exactly what will be most popular even in a social vacuum, but surely catering to a more general level is the best place for a toy to be?  No-one should be <i>prevented</i> from role-playing stereotypes if they want, but neither should they be forced to make greater allowances if they want to violate them.<p>(Violate.  Huh.  It's telling that that's the word often used to describe not complying with stereotypes.)",1337558016

You get this, and if you want that - npm this.<p>You can extend to your heart's content with node on functionality - but you start with the bare minimum and build accordingly to your requirements.  You aren't overwhelmed - you are presented with a basic set of building blocks, and when you cannot accomplish what you need to with the current set of blocks, you research the modules that meet those specific needs.<p>Think of it like building your own PHP stack from scratch from the source.  Except with more of a dynamic perspective.<p>For example, standard crypto functions are not available in the base node, but installing the ""crypto"" module makes them available.  Same for mysql, server pooling functions, clustering, and even a decent web/api ""framework"" (Express).  You add as appropriate.  you leave out what isn't needed.<p>Our team runs a huge PHP stack for all our apps, so it is a breath of fresh air to be faced with the notion that we are truly architecting our entire code platform, bottom up, vs just calling a bunch of pre-loaded functions.

And you gotta start there.</i><p>See, I disagree that it has to start there.<p>I love the movie, but I analyze it that Dan O'Bannon wrote a script in the 80s for an 80s crowd, and he knew that the audience and the purchasers of his script would love seeing a shapely Ellen Ripley in her feminine white panties one moment and in a masculine yellow loader the next showing all the military men she was their equal or better.  It was a rah rah feminism moment, one of many you go grrl moments in cinema.   (And O'Bannon also knew about Chekhov's gun and knew it would be good for the audience to introduce her talents with the loader early in the movie.)<p>So I see the internal narrative as a function of what scripts could be expected to sold and be successful in the 80s.<p>Similarly, Aliens can also be analyzed outside the narrative of the movie as a Vietnam War movie, and in the early 80s when it came out, that was a pretty big deal, especially since the movie was a science fiction movie, set in the future, about the Vietnam War.",1337557882

4000554,comment,3998718,3998718,12,0,tzs,,,"I see a lot of discussion of the legal system and assignment of liability. There's an interesting fact about the legal system in non-criminal cases that is widely overlooked--there is usually no possible outcome that doesn't screw someone.<p>Accordingly, when someone is found liable in tort, it doesn't necessarily mean the court is <i>blaming</i> them for the accident.<p>Let me give a classic example. Three men go out hunting. They come to a clearing, and two of the men go around on the left and the third goes around on the right.<p>A game bird flies up from the clearing when the two groups are on opposite sides. Both men on the left fire at the bird. One of them gets the bird. One of them misses the bird but hits their companion who was going around the right.<p>It is not possible to determine which man shot the bird and which shot the human. Both shooters claim that they definitely shot the bird, of course.<p>The third man sues the first two. There's no outcome that does not screw at least one of the three:<p>1. The court could find neither shooter is liable, since it cannot be proven which actually fired the errant shot. That screws the third man since he got shot and cannot collect damages from the shooter.<p>2. The court could find that both shooters are liable, and make each pay half the damages. Assuming each shooter can actually afford half the damages that is fair to the third man, but screws whichever shooter actually hit the bird.<p>3. Furthermore, in #3, support it turns out one of the shooters has a lot more money than the other. Then in addition to screwing one of the shooters, the third man could get screwed in that he might not be able to collect enough to cover his medical bills.<p>4. The court could find that the two shooters are jointly liable, and not even try to allocate blame between them. The third man can enforce the judgement against them however he wants. So, if one shooter has a lot of money and one does not, the third man would enforce against the one with the most money. This is good for the third man as it lets him get his medical bills covered. It potentially screws the wealthy shooter, though, if in fact he was the one who shot the bird--he's left holding the bag for all of the damages.<p>The way it actually happens in most states is #4. The idea is that of the three men the one who least deserves getting screwed is the guy who got shot, so we want to maximize the chances that he can recover full damages, and can do so quickly. Only #4 ensures that.<p>As far as the shooters go, if one of them isn't happy with the way the third man chooses to go about collating the damages, he's free to file a lawsuit against the other shooter to recover the amount he thinks he was unfairly forced to pay.<p>Note that even though one of the shooters did not shoot the third man, it was his shot that created the ambiguity as to which one of them did shoot the third man.<p>This is called ""joint and several liability"".<p>This is a pretty good system. It lets the party that is actually injured get damages quicker to get them on the road to recovery (and keep them from getting bankrupted by medical bills), but still lets the parties that contributed to the injury fight it out among themselves to figure out how, ultimately, the damages should be split among them.<p>Note: joint and several liability only applies to defendants who do have some liability, as determined by the court, I believe.",1337557228

I'm not arguing whether it is or isn't, but it's certainly popular.<p>My favorite 'weekend' app of the moment is Word Wars[1], which happened to be built during a hackathon.<p>I'm putting the finishing touches on ""By A Bus"", which is a source code escrow service activated by a dead man's switch that I started tinkering with yesterday, after reading this HN thread: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3990761"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3990761</a><p>Why am I doing it?  I thought it would be a fairly easy thing that could be knocked out pretty quickly that would solve the problem of what happens to source code when their developers die.  Source code escrow services are complicated and expensive, but with ""By A Bus"", you can just choose to escrow your Github-hosted source code so that if you die, all (or some of) your private repositories can be open sourced, or 'willed' to other open source contributors to take care of.<p>It is useless?  Well, now it certainly is, and even after it launches, it might still be except to a small percentage of developers.  I'll have learned a little more about the dotcloud infrastructure when it's done, and learned the GitHub v3 REST API, which I'd never touched before.<p>This kind of experience isn't exactly groundbreaking, but the more little things I can touch, the better off overall I am to be able to handle new things that I haven't seen before, or figure out how 'thing a' will interact with 'thing b'.<p>Most importantly though, small things can grow to be bigger things.  Twitter wasn't exactly the hyper-mega trending analytics engine it is today when it first launched, but it grew into that as its creators realized how people were using it.  Google started out as a search engine, and is now one of the biggest companies in the world.  The best ideas start from small beginnings, and I'd much rather have a small project that a few hundred people like than a Facebook-sized project that nobody does, and I'll have wasted a lot less time in getting there.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://wordwars.clay.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordwars.clay.io</a>",1337556396

If you're out late in some crowded dive, you're probably all tired, all warm under the collar, and all breathing the same stale air. You're probably all on the verge of a yawn, too, and the power of suggestion from seeing one person do it is enough to push everybody else over the edge.<p>Adults rarely catch a case of the yawns from a child or animal, which tends to corroborate this idea. Children usually have different sleep schedules and respiration rates from adults, so you would expect them to yawn at different times.""<p>The ""everybody else is probably tired, hot, breathing the same air, etc"" always sounded convincing to me.

It has value, to you and to society, apart from its utility as a factor infiltering people for job positions.<p>No one wants to see the US become even more uneducated.If you want to get cynical about the job market (and young people dohave a right to be cynical about it), try thinking of it this way. Nodoubt most have heard the old adage, ""You need to sell yourself."" Anotherway to think of this is that ""jobs"" are really a question of convincingsomeone else (not necessarily an employer, but maybe a client) to pay you.That is always what it comes down to.  This could be an elaborate processinvolving educational degrees, past accomplishments, recommendations,etc. or, in today's world, it might be something like the startupsdiscussed here on HN: You announce a bit of software and a website,and the thundering herd starts clicking. Some of the herd is willingto pay. If that percentage is large enough, you have a runaway success,something like Dropbox.Those who are paying you are not asking to see your resume. The onlypeople who cared that you graduated from MIT were the VC and their clientswho funded you. That is, if you were funded. Don't kid yourself. The mostimportant people you convinced to pay you werenot the investors. Theywere the customers.  In the end what mattered is whether customers wereconvinced to pay you.   How they arrived at that decision might actuallybe quite simple (and quite arbitrary).<p>Now, maybe using the web as your medium you manange to become wealthyovernight. But that does not reduce the long term value of your degreefrom MIT. The degree is not necessarily the cause of your success(e.g. maybe you cannot prove that it was). Wealth can be made withor without education.  (That has always been true, otherwise smallbusiness, which is the majority of business in the US, would cease toexist.) Technology allows this to happen now in a way never before seenin history.<p>But...<p>Education has value to you and to society because education will makeyour life more interesting and an educated society is better than anuneducated one.These are tough times.

AFAIK US has bankruptcy - both business and personal.<p>> Under the new law it's much more difficult to get one's debts discharged and almost impossible to get student loans discharged.<p>Getting loans discharged is supposed to be difficult. If it were easy, nobody would pay them and there would be no credit market. As for student loans, what did you expect when you demanded unlimited lending at fixed interest? That banks would lend out all that money, take all that risk - and then allow people to just tell ""oh, nevermind, I'm not really gonna pay this""? How that business is supposed to work then? The non-dischargeable debt is a direct consequence of the fixed rate (meaning, no ability to risk-adjust) and broad availability (meaning, no ability to reduce risk). It's either that or complete nationalization (read, global bailout) of all that debt. Arithmetics is a dismal science, you can't have 2+2 equal more than 4, however you try.

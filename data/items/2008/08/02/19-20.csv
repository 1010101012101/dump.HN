This is what I did for Mibbit, and it worked out very well.\nOf course it depends on what you're writing, and if any frameworks out there are up to the job, so maybe this advice is unhelpful for you.<p>You might however be surprised just how easy it is to create your own custom framework.",1217707189
265163,comment,264760,265129,0,0,briansmith,,,"% spam has probably increased by this, as it is only a barrier to entry to mass-mailers that aren't spammers. Examples are: Paypal, EBay, airlines (although a lot of airline email looks like SPAM to me). You have to verify your identity with state-issued documents for some (all?) of those programs. There are a lot of restrictions (contractual and technical) applied to the messages that are sent through such programs. They are too expensive and risky for spammers to make money using them; in fact, they are too expensive for almost anybody to bother signing up for them.",1217706909

I think Toyota has the capital and brand to take it to the next level.<p>Hopefully they put the resources towards it because I'd like to see what happens with this.",1217706848

Not everyone is going to be on campus at once.<p>Thankfully not every user is using BitTorrent. But some are. If the statistical model assumes that no one will ever use all they are alloted, then the model is broken and needs to be re-calibrated. If this results in a price increase, at least that is transparent, rather than traffic shaping and individual throttling, which denies people something they paid for, and basically amounts to false advertising:<p>> <i>""Speeds up to 150x faster than dialup![1]""</i><p>[1] But you can't actually take advantage of that rate, because it'd be rude to your neighbors.",1217705674

9559283,comment,9553591,9556178,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">The U.N. is closer to what I was imagining, but regardless, what I&#x27;d like to see is a strong push for North Korea to open it&#x27;s borders in exchange for a lightening of sanctions.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t fly with them. Their entire governmental ideology is based upon something called &quot;Juche&quot; which means &#x27;self reliance&#x27;. It would kinda be like asking the US to give up the first amendment in exchange for some trade goodies. Just not gonna happen.<p>>The NK leadership&#x27;s power is retained almost entirely through keeping people in the dark.<p>This isn&#x27;t true. People are not in the dark as much as you might think. They <i>are</i> vaguely aware of what goes on outside the  country&#x27;s borders. It would be impossible for them not to be. This is partly why a year ago the NK government released a list of &quot;best places in the world to live&quot;. China was #1 because North Koreans are able to watch the Chinese get rich and the government couldn&#x27;t deny it.<p>The leadership&#x27;s power is predicated mostly upon two things :<p>A) Propaganda that makes the citizens afraid of the outside world - US and Japan mostly. Unfortunately, when the US does shit like invade Iraq, saber rattle Iran, and sticks nukes on the 38th parallel (did you not wonder why NK developed nukes? THAT&#x27;S why), it&#x27;s not that hard to convince North Koreans that they are under mortal threat. The strong censorship helps a lot with this, but the propaganda would probably still hold pretty well without it.<p>B) A gift economy. The leader showers his underlings with maseratis. He showers his underlings with jewellery. He showers his underlings with alcohol. Etcetera. All the way down. The hierarchy is <i>very</i> well cemented in by strong ties of loyalty. Chop off the head and all of that remains.<p>>On a wackier, cantankerous note, I also envision a scheme of dropping solar-charged epaper tablets and blasting the entire country with free WiFi to make locking down knowledge about the outside world impossible.<p>This type of thing has been going on for a long time (hell, we&#x27;ve had short wave radios for how long?). It doesn&#x27;t really seem to be working.<p>Yes, the North Koreans get this stuff sometimes, but seeing a DVD of Friends doesn&#x27;t immediately inspire them to overthrow their government and the smart ones are rightfully terrified of owning such contraband.<p>I&#x27;d be more optimistic about this strategy, too, if propaganda didn&#x27;t work so well on American citizens, who have <i>all</i> of those things and yet still believe absurd lies fed to them by their leaders.",1431853186

9559281,comment,9549449,9558073,0,0,bayesianhorse,,,"You seem to have a very low standard regarding &quot;proofs&quot;. The article you cited derives broad macro-economic conclusions from storified anecdotes. In the particular case of a &quot;masseuse course&quot; the agency just doesn&#x27;t see it as a valuable and accredited program. Such courses prefer taking money from participants directly rather than trying to make bureaucracies believe in them.<p>And yes, then the participants have to pay to attend. They might even have illusions on their employment prospects. If they were to attend an actual physiotherapy course, things may be different. The problem with these types of programs in Germany is that they are mostly privately funded. That is a problem yet to be addressed.<p>People tend to attribute the &quot;being stuck&quot; in welfare to the welfare system itself. That may happen, I just don&#x27;t see it as a significant factor. The subsidizing of low-skilled labor is a different problem, and is partly addressed by the recent minimum wage.<p>The US is an entirely different place. Lower unemployment, but there, even many employed workers have a much harder life and live in poorer conditions than jobless Germans.

Even if you could move to an almost-identical service, there will be not-insignificant switching costs as you reconfigure everything with a different API and reimplement the glue code.<p>>So IMHO there is no lock in in the traditional sense<p>Lock-in doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s impossible to move to a different platform, it just means that there&#x27;s a high cost. To me, it seems like the cost of moving this to some other platform is quite a bit higher than the cost of moving something from, say, EC2.<p>Actually, it seems like this is Amazon&#x27;s real business strategy with things like this. They want you to use all of their different services like this, SQS, SES, Elastic beanstalk, their hosted database thing. Individually the costs of moving away from all of them is not <i>that</i> high, but add them all together and it becomes immense.",1431852395

Support have offered me a $80 credit and offered to restore from a backup.<p>You should probably snapshot your instances before resizing, or migrate to a new instance manually.<p>(Thankfully I&#x27;ve built a replacement box from Ansible in the meantime.)<p>The upgrade process appears to have involved copying to different hardware across the network, since the resize operation took over 15 minutes. That copy seems to be incomplete, which led to a completely unrecoverable filesystem.<p>On coming back up, the system displayed &quot;DOROOT does not exist after resize&quot;. Running a filesystem check scrolled tens of thousands of e2fsck &quot;fixes&quot; for a period of 12 minutes.<p>As expected, the end result of that is that all &quot;files&quot; on the filesystem were in /mnt/lost+found with random names, and the data in them no doubt corrupt too.<p>Digital Ocean support does not appear to be able to re-copy or review the previous block device to determine the source of the problem. They also don&#x27;t appear to have logs of the resize operation.<p>Sure - it&#x27;s always possible the filesystem was irretrievably corrupted before reboot - but I think it&#x27;s pretty unlikely. Given that I&#x27;ve not been doing things like &#x27;dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/vda1&#x27; on there, that would probably indicate a hardware fault on their side anyway.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that I rebooted the box successfully a few minutes before the resize, so a (journaled) e2fsck ran at that point.

I don&#x27;t see casinos and drugs (including alcohol) going away any time soon, and attempting to stop them is misdirected in my opinion. The problem is that for a small proportion of the public (typically people with mental health issues) they end up being used as self-medication, often unknowingly, and can make bad situations worse - leading to financial ruin, families torn apart, suicide or overdose in the case of drugs. (JP Morgan & Starbucks don&#x27;t have these properties.)<p>For that reason, in the meatspace, casinos are highly regulated and need to identify and protect vulnerable people. So yes - while your app is a substitute for a physical activity, in the physical world that person would have gone through many more hoops that would have allowed people to help them or notice their problem. In digital space, there is no such visibility and there are no regulations, which is why it becomes interesting to see what people do and say about what they do.",1431850968

From my very limited experience of how he explain topics, he tends to be playful.

Money is just created to reflect wealth: it&#x27;s literally just invented by your government (or, in the case of Bitcoin, just by proven work). And wealth doesn&#x27;t have to be earned; it just has to be created.</i><p>My point was that people have to do something to acquire the money they have, and no one is going to give it to them &quot;for free&quot;. All the money people have represents some sort of valuable activity, time used and effort spent.<p>So basically, money isn&#x27;t free. It costs time and effort, and that&#x27;s a central reason for why there&#x27;s a limit to how much of it you can take from people.<p>(Let&#x27;s not bicker about the financial industry at this point though - they&#x27;re not actually providing value anyway)<p>But it makes no sense to say that &quot;money is just created to reflect wealth&quot;. I get that wealth is all of the stuff we have available to us, in whatever pursuits it may be useful, and so on. But money is just a means of exchange. It&#x27;s fundamentally a commodity that has become widely accepted in exchange for goods and services.<p>Now that&#x27;s not how our fiat currencies work in today&#x27;s world, but that&#x27;s just because governments have abandoned sound money altogether. What I&#x27;m talking about - and what you should be too - is sound money. Something that just emerged as money through people engaging in voluntary trades.<p>Anyway, you&#x27;re not in a position to complain about my understanding about economics (or taxes or whatever).<p>> <i>Sure, I&#x27;m going to stop contracting at $3000 a week because, hey!, I could just live on $30 a week instead.</i><p>Is that supposed to be an argument against something I said?

""Its incumbent on you (and certainly also me) to make sure that were starting businesses in segments that actuallyrequire a new entrant and can not be filled by aproduct line extension from an incumbent. Whether or not they fill holes as early as Twitter, large companies with developer programs all consolidate their segments  and do so a economically as possible. That means every third-party developer grows up, sells cheap, or dies.""<p>But what does require a new entrant mean here?  Who requires it?  There is surely only one meaningful answer - the consumer.  Moving on...  What sort of new entrant offering can not be filled by a product line extension from an incumbent?  I suggest in the context we should parse this to mean ... platform company cannot build a competitive offering.  But of course, there is little that such well financed companies who control the platform cant build.  More to the point there is still less that cant build if all they have to do is copy an existing product.  So this is a very strong condition.  Perhaps you mean - software the platform company doesn't want to build?  One answer along these lines is to build software for a small segment the platform company cannot be bothered to address.  But for an ambitious developer who wants to add significant value to millions of users I am not sure it is possible to develop such an offering - insulated from potential competition by the platform company - unless the platform company has a clear policy vis a vis developers and provides very clear signals with a very clear record to trustworthy behavior that gives a high degree of confidence it is safe to proceed.  But of course developer is taking a risk that the platform company can bait and switch.  I am unsure what large companies with developer programs all consolidate their segments means.  But if it means that such platform companies have an inbuilt drive to purchase their devs I cant agree. The big platforms have so much software on them that even the wealthiest company couldnt buy it all even if they wanted to.  I dont know what a cannabilistic cash flow is. This may be a term of art I am just unfamiliar with.  But if it means a cash flow built on the back of the host platform, this surely refers to the cash flow of all apps built on a platform.  So I am unclear this idea moves the ball forward.  If on the other hand the idea is that it will cost the host money for no clear ROI then this is indeed always possible, but just as obviously if there is no clear monetization strategy the dev is taking a huge risk.  It can work out but of course most times, not surprisingly, it doesn't. (Clay Christen makes much of this dynamic and the challenges of marginal rather than absolute costing when he discusses such cases as Blockbuster competing with Netflix.  But the undiscussed part of his argument is the hindsight effect.  Blockbuster were right to ignore most of the market entrants.  Most never got any traction.  With a thousand flowers trying to bloom, which one will see the sunlight?) So  building software that doesn't seem to make financial sense will doubtless reduce the risk of the platform company competing, but you'd better have something up your sleeve. The Instagram example is indeed important.  But it is important precisely because of the very different behavior of Apple and Facebook vis a vis their devs.  Apple has had long experience of working with devs and a deeply wired understanding of how to foster and manage relations with their developers. iOS is a platform.  Apple provides some core apps but other than that it is a free range and the overwhelming majority of devs can be confident Apple isnt going to compete with them.  It seems to me that the whole point of DCs argument is that Facebook declared itself a platform, provided APIs, provided assurances that his product was seen as valuable and would be welcomed and then, having given him the confidence to build it, turned on him threatened to cut off his access to the platform on which his app relied and then offered to buy him out.  This is very different behavior.<p>So to be honest, I dont find the argument very clear. Im not sure we agree on what the responsibilities of a company that declares itself to be offering a platform are. I cant extract a convincing strategy here for how you feel devs can best to develop on a platform. And whilst you seem to feel you have some sort of lesson for DC about how to work on a platform even if the company baits and switches, I can't fathom what that lesson is.",1344031003

The point is that when everybody does that already, the next differentiating factor becomes the amount of hours put in.

4336369,comment,4335314,4335314,5,0,mhartl,,,"I taught the physics core curriculum at Caltech for five years, so I'll do what I can to help. For many of the classes at Caltech, we never found a truly satisfying textbook, but when you're learning on your own that's still the route I recommend. This means putting textbooks back on your list for consideration. Buying a textbook for a full 1-2 year college-level physics sequence costs less than $200, <i>much</i> less if you buy used. You have parents, right? Now they know what to get you for your birthday.<p>Your immediate goal should be to get a firm grounding in classical physics, which will be important for everything else you do. When choosing a textbook, the most important thing is to pick one that's aimed at scientists and engineers. That means it should be calculus-based, ""algebra-based physics"" being a contradiction in terms. If you don't know calculus, you should start there. (This will set you back some more money. Sounds like a plan for Christmas, Hanukkah, etc.)<p>To my knowledge, none of the introductory texts are truly great, but I did some poking around and <i>University Physics</i> by Young, Freedman, and Ford looks like a good bet. If you need to learn calculus, <i>Calculus</i> by Larson and Edwards looks decent. Get the most recent editions if you can afford them, but I'm sure older editions are fine. Those two books alone should take you a year or two to consume, and they are likely to be <i>very</i> challenging unless you have an exceptional preparation in mathematics. But even if you get stuck occasionally, you'll still be <i>way</i> ahead of the curve. (I wish someone had put a calculus-based physics textbook in my hands when I was in high school. I would have been <i>unstoppable</i>. Unfortunately, though it now seems impossible, I went to high school before Amazon or even the Web, so it simply never occurred to anyone.)<p>I recommend supplementing the textbooks with liberal use of Khan Academy videos and Wikipedia articles. More than anything, it is essential to solve a large number of exercises. Developing a good physical intuition is important, but physics is a quantitative discipline, which means being able to do calculations.<p>One more thing: if you want to demonstrate your competence to the world (and to college admissions committees), it's a good idea to take the AP Physics exam (B or C) at some point. The AP Physics C exam is the best one to target if you only have enough time to take one, as it will let you test out of introductory courses at many schools. (Not at Caltech thoughwe have a separate system of placement exams.) Take a look at the AP Physics C website to see the syllabus. If you decide to take the exam, buying a test-prep book such as <i>5 Steps to a 5 AP Physics B&C</i> is probably a good idea. If you go this route, try to negotiate with your school to get course credit for your independent study.<p>P.S. At some point, read <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>. FLP doesn't make for a good introduction, but after you have a foundation it's gold.",1344030575

If instead you talked to a bunch of people and said, ""I'm here to solve your biggest problem, tell me about it so that I can get started."" you get from your future users what they think is the biggest problem that needs solving.<p>Now if you talk to a lot of people you will get a set of problems. If you make sure you talk to people of different ages then you'll populate your set with problems from different age groups (and different life stages), if you talk to people in different industries you will populate your set of problems with with different skill sets, and if you talk to people at different sized companies you will populate your problem set with people with varying levels of time/money to invest or spend.<p>Now if you take those problems, and try to tease out what the underlying structural issue is that makes it a problem you will get a list of structural issues.<p>Finally, after all this talk talk talk, you find the structural issues which are at root of many problems, and then design a product around that.<p>Your will have a huge advantage.

They skipped the hub and spoke model and flew out of peripheral airports that were cheaper, and boarded like buses with no reserved seats to shorten the idle time a the gate, etc. no long flights meant no meal service. There was no possible way for United and American to match them on price. They were afraid to adopt any of these changes because it might tarnish their brand. They were too focused on competing with each other.<p>Dell offered lower costs than their competitors by charging up front for the computer before buying the parts (which were steadily falling in price). The competition were stuck with a channel model where they shipped finished computers to channel partners for stocking in inventory, so they not only had to buy parts far in advance but had to give a cut to channel partners and retailers, making their prices higher and profit lower.<p>Netscape had a dozen competitors to their browser. Netscspe offered free downloads to anyone, and with a wink asked for a licensing fee. No individuals paid it, but corporations did because they wanted to be in legal compliance.

As I explained in another comment in this thread, I think a substantial part of the goal of education, for many people, is in bettering their lives in the material sense; so, if we define 'quality' as 'the extent to which something fulfills its purpose', then the quality of education can, in some aspects, be measured by the amount that it allows people to better their lives; for example, to put that more concretely, in a country where a big enough portion of the people receives an education, and if we attribute an increase in GDP at least partially to an increase in education (a not unreasonable assumption, imo), and if other factors remain relatively stable, then we can measure the success of the educational system by using prosperity as a proxy for it.<p>I proposed per capita GDP in the example above, there probably are others; maybe the weighted for cost of living median wage of those who actually got educations, for example. But analyses or data like that aren't that easy to come by, so if enough people get an education, we could use overall GDP as a proxy. I acknowledge fully that there are many more factors at play here, so I'm not proposing this as a one-size-fits-all measurement; but just as cash-on-cash-return can be a useful first-order indicator in some contexts and for some purposes to get an estimate of the performance of an investment; and just like lines of code can be a useful first-order indicator in some contexts and for some purposes to get an estimate of the complexity of a code base; GDP can be (I'm arguing) a useful first-order indicator of the extent to which an educational system fulfills its goals - which I'd argue is the 'quality' thereof.<p>But, to answer your question more directly, I guess that any metric on the material (or maybe even mental) prosperity of an educated subset of a population would be 'good evidence'. It depends on what one defines the goals of education to be; but realistically, I think that the material part should be a sizable part of any such definition.",1344028780

But they didn't, because they still don't know how to monetize their mobile traffic (which should answer the question, ""Why is Facebook's mobile app so awful?"")

My guess is Instagram realized that Facebook was basically forced to buy them and made them pay for it ($1B).<p>So I work on a startup in the news/journalism industry.

4336161,comment,4333513,4335220,2,0,roel_v,,,"Yes, sorry, I meant per capita gdp, otherwise big countries would win out easily by sheer numbers.<p>I'm not definitively saying any of these are measures of that - the study of the effectiveness of education is a whole field of academic study on its own. What I meant was, many people use subjective measures that are grounded in cultural traditions as a metric for it, but I think that more objective measures of 'success' (such as prosperity, both individual and of the country as a whole, and for which I use per capita gdp as a proxy, with the caveat that said per capita GDP should probably be distributed roughly normally and have a not too large standard deviation - although I'm not prepared to quantify that, that's a whole other discussion...) are better criteria.<p>The reason I propose GDP, and this also answers your second question, is the assumption that people get educations to better their lives, at least in part in the material sense. So, the measure of the success of the educational system is in to what extent people actually better their lives in that aspect - to put it bluntly, how much (more) money they make. Of course making money isn't the only driving factor for many people when choosing what to study, but then again, for a majority of students it's a matter of weighing three factors: what do I like, what am I capable of, and what kind of a lifestyle will it provide me with. Since the first two are more or less fixed, the financial prospects of an education become a substantive decisive factor when it comes to study of choice.<p>So, in that line of reasoning, GDP is not a measure of the medical health of a country; since medical health is a goal in itself, while education is (partially, and in the aggregate, I'm not interested in nitpicking on the absoluteness of my phrasing...) a means to an end, to bettering ones life (at least partially) in the material sense, which is expressed by proxy in per capita GDP.",1344027688

Furthermore, there is always room for expression that is related to the topic. Are we limited to reasonable discourse? Are we not allowed to express how we feel about the topic at hand? I don't think that lack of reasonable discussion implies lack of civility. People can be passionate (even expressing this through profanity) without detracting from the discussion at all.<p>Nonetheless, I see your point when extrapolated to wider use. I also admit that I am biased in also hating Javascript; in a different context, I'm sure I'd be equally as upset.",1344027666

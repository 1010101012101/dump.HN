8746773,comment,8745334,8745785,0,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>&quot;What actually happened was the behaviors intensified!&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ve seen it work both ways.  Sometimes, being direct about labeling and pointing out bad behavior shames the worst actors, and educates people who had been doing it accidentally.  Other times, it simply becomes another tool for the worst actors to use -- just another way to attack.  (See also: the fallacy fallacy.)<p>In my experience, the biggest factors in whether things seem to go uphill or downhill after pointing out versions of rhetorical dodging/avoidance are:<p>(1) does the community have good examples of people doing it right?  Shaming bad behavior only works in conjunction with modeling good behavior.  (This is one reason I dislike HN&#x27;s hiding comment scores -- there&#x27;s a visual indicator for what makes a bad comment, but no visual indicator for what makes an excellent comment.  &quot;Top comment on a post&quot; is a fairly weak signal as it misses excellent child/grandchild/deeper comments.)<p>(2) do the moderators have &quot;soft power&quot; to go with their &quot;hard power&quot; -- that is, are they respected enough that they can successfully ask people to change their behavior without needing to threaten a ban?<p>(3) when the moderators (or downvotes or flags) come in, are they fair?  Do they tend to target bad actors from all sides, or do they let Green Team&#x27;s jerks get away with behavior that Purple Team&#x27;s jerks get banned for?<p>(4) is the community as a whole already burned out?  It can be much harder to change behaviors when people stopped caring long ago.<p>-------<p>If I may add more labels to your list:<p>- &quot;Rapid Deadline&quot;.  Asking a question, making an argument, or posting a source/article and then making character attacks on opponents for having not answered even though not enough time has passed to reasonably expect answers.  Or pretending like your point is agreed upon simply because it didn&#x27;t get any responses in the first few minutes, and then arguing as if that point is now unassailable.  This is particularly dangerous when one makes an argument that can take some time/thought/patience to respond to.  (The only person I have blocked on FaceBook is an old friend who resorted to this tactic one too many times -- he&#x27;d post an article and then follow it up with insults about how I hadn&#x27;t answered 3 minutes later, when the article took a good 10 minutes to read.  Then he&#x27;d send private messages asking why I hadn&#x27;t responded, and accusing me of cowardice.)<p>- &quot;Not the real position&quot;.  Using reasons you don&#x27;t actually believe to advocate for something, such that even if all of those reasons are shot down, there&#x27;s no possibility of changing your mind because your other, secret reasons haven&#x27;t been answered.<p>- &quot;Secret knowledge&quot; (this might relate to your #5).  Basically, you can&#x27;t understand this unless you&#x27;re of a particular race, gender, economic class, educational background, religion, etc. so I won&#x27;t even attempt to explain it.  (Often comes with statements like &quot;check your privilege&quot; or &quot;alternate reality&quot;.)<p>- &quot;I read your post backwards.&quot;  (I had someone actually say this to me once!)  Really, any sort of response that treats an opposing position as meaning something completely unrelated to what it was intended to mean.  The classic line-by-line response sometimes has this property -- every sentence gets responded to, but somehow all of the really important points end up getting ignored.",1418511073

A naive developer with little security understanding will look at that question and might even ask other members of the team about it.  After a short bit of research the developer answers the question as &quot;yes the application implements input validation and output encoding&quot; based on finding that the framework utilized does in fact have input validation and output encoding functionality built in.<p>Of course while the framework might have such controls and they may even be implemented for the particular code base, it turns out that relying on the framework alone isn&#x27;t sufficient because there are many places in the code where that framework can be subverted or entirely bypassed.  Rather than stopping at the framework controls the developer actually needed to perform a code audit and find everywhere user data might go to a sink which could result in unauthorized code execution, SQLi, or XSS.<p>This is a particular scenario I&#x27;ve seen from the days of PHP magic quotes all the way to the latest ASP.NET request validation.  It turns out the question was too simplistic.  If we look at solving this problem we then need to dive into a great level of detail not only pertaining specifically to the framework controls available within the environment, but we must also look at how the code is implemented, ultimately scrapping the check-list only approach in favor of static code analysis.  Of course if a management team only has a checklist and they are getting false answers as exampled above, they have no idea why they need static code analysis or should pay for the software and resources to use it.",1418510286

I think that increases the divide between The Haves and The Have Nots. And I think that is one reason monetizing art is a hard problem to solve: Because it shouldn&#x27;t just be for the rich.

As everyone else does really. And you can get similar CPU benchmarks level as other architectures. 
Then the very same instruction architecture can have pretty wide power efficiency differences depending on implementations. Just look at Atom vs. Core, A8 vs. 15... Even the same model shows big differences based on implementation choices (optimize for speed vs. area/cost for example).<p>As someone working on SoC, I believe the key difference in MIPS vs. ARM vs. Intel is not so much the instruction set, but the work effort spent on optimizing the implementations close to the processes. It&#x27;s pretty obvious for Intel, but ARM spends a lot of time with the big foundries (TSMC, GlobalFoundries, Samsung) to make sure their implementation are well tuned. And they pass on the know-how to their customers through what they call &quot;POPs&quot; (Process Optimization Packages). This is important for ARM, but also for the foundries as ARM is the de facto standard in mobile. A lot of work go in this, and it shows at the high end. MIPS/Imagination recently propose something similar for MIP, but they&#x27;re far from having the same amount of resources.

If you are recording something important, it may well be worth the higher SR just in case some technology comes along that can exploit it. But the 20-20kHz bandlimit is a pretty well-entrenched thing. People are working in it. It&#x27;s tough sledding.<p>So the rule of thumb is that each bit gives -6dB more noise floor. This gives us a rough <i>digital</i> noise floor of -96dB for 16 bit or -144dB for 24 bit. But you can add dither to randomize the digital noise, and turn it into &quot;white noise&quot; or the like.<p>Aliasing is taken care of by the &quot;reconstruction filter&quot; ( named for the &quot;reconstruction&quot; part of the Shannon-Nyquist theorem). This has been a solved problem for some time now. There&#x27;s a super-high speed digital filter in the DAC phase that  can be measured to eliminate all aliasing products. Implementation quality varies, but even cheap  stuff now does a good job of it.<p>Yes; it&#x27;s unusual to have a room for recording that gets to -70dB much less -96dB. -40 to -50 is much more typical for, say acoustic guitar.

I don&#x27;t think anything came close, though, and still miss it even though I use Macs these days.",1418508279

Most parents asking this question are just seeking reassurance about what their child does.<p>We know there are some problems with excess screen tine (mostly sleep hygiene, but can combine with speech problems in extreme cases) so it&#x27;s a good thing that parents ask.<p>Parents normally know if they have a neuro-atypical child and would tailor the questions appropriately.",1418508211

That said, since UBER is privately held, no one can say what they are &quot;worth&quot; (a term which also has many interpretations).<p>The article published in Salon was a draft I sent them and they ran with it.  Once I knew they were interested, I did a lot more research and number crunching, assuming they would want more facts and detail.  They didn&#x27;t change a thing!  They published the article in their &quot;Life&quot; section.  I think this section is reserved for non-reporters writing about life experiences and that&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t require expert fact-checking.  I do agree that no one knows who gets paid what in the upper-echelons of UBER - but I would guess it&#x27;s a LOT.",1418508180

4759796,comment,4757414,4759570,2,0,Karunamon,,,">This instance of a job ad with a stated preference for native peoples is discriminatory, yes, but that is wholly acceptable given the state the US and its policies have put native peoples in.<p>You agree that it's discrimination. Finally.<p>So discrimination is okay in certain circumstances.<p>.. I find that hard to accept. Again, you're proposing that the answer for discrimination is more discrimination. What does violent crime and equal participation in society that you keep bringing up have to do with allowing one group to do something we don't allow any other group to do?<p>What does allowing this accomplish that enforcing the existing equality laws does not? (Referring to EEO and EEH acts, if they are applied like they should be?) Legally, how does this not fall afoul of the equal protection laws as defined in the constitution?<p>On a more practical level, wouldn't it be more beneficial for everyone involved (the employeer, the employee, society at large) for someone hiring for a position to choose the most qualified person for the job rather than selecting explictly for racial background?<p>>Your message isn't just that all discrimination is wrong. You quite clearly took aim at the behavior of and policies directed towards minorities as wrong or unjust.<p>That <i>is</i> my message, and whatever other subtext you choose to read into it is entirely between you and your keyboard. Knock it off.<p>I don't feel particularly discriminated against here, so I hardly have a dog in this hunt. I don't like how I'm not allowed to question a discriminatory law without being presumed racist. Basically pointing and asking ""WTF?"" is what I'm doing here.",1352408397

The most elegant code in the world is pointless if it doesn't solve a real problem (the end product), and the an unmaintainable and unscalable mess of crap that actually shipped on time is equally pointless if it's so broken that user's can't use the product or developers can't improve upon it.<p>Great people need to find a balance, and I don't think leaning towards one side or another shows whether someone would be a great employee and/or founder. This ""ship early/ship often"" and ""move fast and break stuff"" attitude is ok for immature products, but there's still a minimum level of quality you need to reach, and as your userbase grows and your product matures, it's almost certainly going to be important to raise the bar on quality.<p>Shipping prototypes is fine, but you have to keep in mind that if it catches on, your plan to rebuild a non-crap version (invariably you had this plan) will fall through because something else came up.<p>My rule of thumb for prototypes is to get the data models close to right, and untangle the rest later. Pulling apart spaghetti code isn't too bad as long as there's reasonably sane intent behind it. I can fix systems where people are updating state from the views and writing to the db in all sorts of unimaginable, horrible ways; however, if you're not storing the right info, you're pretty screwed and have a hell of a migration process in your future.",1352408162

4759773,comment,4757414,4758381,7,0,rmc,,,"<i>The problem with affirmative action is that it is based on race. It is racist.</i><p>There are several definitions of racism, one is essentially ""making references to someone's race and implying everyone in that group is the same (in some attribute)"", or more simply ""anything based on race"". Lots of people like this definition because it's a nice, simple and objective defintion and it means black people in the USA can be racist to white people, or that affirmative action is racist. I think this is the definition you're using.<p>There's another definition, which is that racist actions are actions that's designed to maintain & reinforce the institutionalised power structure among races. Right now, if modern USA life was a video game, ""white male"" would be an easier difficulty level than ""black male"". There are statistically less problems for the ""white male"" group. Racist actions is talk that re-enforced that imbalance, and attempts to undo the power imbalance is not racist. This definition is harder for some people to accept because it means that you need to look at yourself and think about what power imbalances you might be benefiting from, and it means that affirmative action is not racist, and attempts to stop is could be construed as racist (since stopping affirmative action can re-enforce power imbalances). This is the definition I use.<p>So no, affirmative action isn't racist.<p><i>America needs to put race on the sidelines and start thinking in terms of class.</i><p>Totally agree. Classism is a real and big problem.",1352408100

In 1996, prior to the ban on race, African Americans and Latinos made up 18.8 percent of the freshman class.

How dumb do you think people at Apple are?

But we know that native people suffer in a systemic way in US society, so they do need targeted help and policies on the basis of race in order to allow them to have the equal participation in society they deserve (and to help them not be disproportionately affected by violent crimes).<p>Institutional racism isn't just about discrimination, but rather prejudice combined with power. This isn't just about attitudes alone, as we are talking about real policies and incidents that are a direct reflection of racist attitudes. This instance of a job ad with a stated preference for native peoples is discriminatory, yes, but that is wholly acceptable given the state the US and its policies have put native peoples in.<p>The notion that affirmative action  is racist or unfairly discriminatory is a perpetuation of the current racist institutions in the US. It supposes that the experience of people of color is not valid, and that their experiences and lives do not need nor deserve any consideration, ignoring the institutional oppressions that effect them. In the absence of targeted programs to help people affected by institutional racism, that kind of structural oppression thrives.<p>>  Saying that all discrimination is wrong perpetuates violence and harm??<p>Your message isn't just that all discrimination is wrong. You quite clearly took aim at the behavior of and policies directed towards minorities as wrong or unjust. This ignores the main point: the behavior and policies of the majority have been wrong and unjust, and small programs and policies to help start to correct this are totally and wholly appropriate. This isn't about treating the majority (read: white) population unfairly, but looking at the numbers, seeing how the policies, laws, and enforcement of laws supported by that majority have negatively affected people of color at rates much higher than whites, and taking action to begin to address that.<p>You scoff at a job ad mentioning they give a preference native applicants, but are thinking about the long history of blood and violence that has occurred and continues to occur to those people? Of course they deserve a better shot at a job (not too mention they deserve much more). The notion of unfair discrimination towards whites as a result of affirmative action policies for jobs and education is a false equivalence.",1352405060

You've included her in the group.<p>And for your second paragraph:  saying ""no, it's not like that"" is marginalizing because it demonstrates an unwillingness to take the woman seriously.

The message communicated is, ""your opinions aren't important"".

It's more like there's a category of crap that ends up shoved at you if you're female, but not if you're male.

However, there is almost no enforcement of these laws. I haven't heard of anything recent, and I watch the topic pretty closely.<p>A lot of companies think that requiring students to get ""college credit"" for their internships provides a loophole to get around the law, but as far as I can tell that's not the case. This is especially interesting, because more and more graduates are taking unpaid internships, which shows that employers are getting even more brazen.<p>My philosophy is that you shouldn't pay your interns because you have to legally; you should pay them because they're worth it. If you can't find a way to make more off of the intern than the $10/hour that you need to pay him or her, then maybe your business isn't ready for interns.",1269486452

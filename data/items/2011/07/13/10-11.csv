I also see the ubiquity of identity information to be a blocker for radically free thinking, a factor that has given great value to the content of the web till now.

Data are most often information that needs to be used; it may be unfinished and require to be passed through several hands for collaboration for completion, or it could be a finished document needing to be sent onto many organizations and then passed through multiple users to inform. It may also be part of an elaborate workflow, across multiple document management systems, working on platforms that cross the desktop and cloud domain. Ultimately, that information may end up in storage in a data center on a third-party server within the cloud, but even then it is likely to be re-used from time to time. This means that the idea of static data is not entirely true and it is much better (certainly in terms of securing that data) to think of it as highly fluid, but intermittently static.",1310552255

I've worked at 3 start-ups before, and after working at Google, I think promise of future riches is the only reason to prefer a start-up. If you are proactive, you get full freedom to choose problems you work on, a ton of computational resources and many very smart and supportive people around you. I had an opportunity to join Google earlier as a ""general pool"" SWE, and I turned it down because I thought I might get stuck maintaining some boring piece of code. But if I knew what I know now, I would've taken it and would probably be in the same position as now -- SWE's have ability to reallocate themselves, and if you find a better team, your old manager isn't going to fight to keep you",1310552222

As the SEO techniques offer a global platform and equal platform for SMEs who have limited budgets and is one of the best web presence stategies for SMEs.

Lovely. Of course, besides being a silly microbenchmark, that's in an array - not a keyed map, and since your protocol is going to evolve, you'll need a keyed map. Since MessagePack serializes map keys <i>with</i> the message, you're going to take a big hit there. Let alone when you have a protocol that grows over several years and has to support a service with over a hundred keys. Eventually, your string keys will become too big of an overhead, and you'll switch to integer keys. Then you have to roll your own translation layer between your space-saving integer keys and useful names for your keys. It's roughly at this point you wish you had picked the ""creaky"" solution which has done the right thing for almost a decade (though of course not open source for that long).",1310551827

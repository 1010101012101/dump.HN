People had a go at being witty or relevant or informative, and it seems everywhere you go on the site these qualities are suppressed. Text posts are truncated and offer a See More button, and images and other easily digestible content are prioritised.<p>This has two important effects:<p>=> News feeds are much quicker to skim, and are much less substantial, which leaves you unsatisfied even when you&#x27;ve seen everything new, so you stick around. I admit this is pretty good monetising strategy on Facebook&#x27;s behalf.<p>=> People start moving to services which imitate the fast flash of attention model promoted by the news feed. That&#x27;s Snapchat, for example. I feel similarly dissatisfied finding out that Alice and Sally got fake-Facebook-married-but-really-just-BFFLs-still for the sixth time as I do seeing some guy who&#x27;s not really my friend doing a random snapchat of his mock-surprised face.<p>It strikes me that so few of my daily interactions online make me feel in any way connected. The best ones are still just talking to people via text or chat, and frankly I feel more connected to @ryanpequin, the comic artist who tweets with brutal honesty from the other side of the world, than most of the friends I see a few times a week.<p>I think Facebook almost hit the nail on the head regarding what teenagers wanted. They live in highly structured communities (schools) and Facebook made it easy to keep thoughts vaguely within communities simply by showing them to people via algorithms. Unfortunately now it doesn&#x27;t have the same charm, and many of the people I know feel the same. But all our friends are on it, so we stay.",1384099133
6706914,comment,6705517,6705517,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"My advice: learn programming but stay the course. I&#x27;m passionate about technology, I love the work, and I love what we <i>can</i> do with our abilities, even if not what most engineers actually do. I&#x27;m 30 years old and now at the point where quality projects are the norm rather than the exception. But it is a hard road, and if you can stomach finance&#x27;s long hours and get the credibility that way, it might be easier.<p>Look at the people tapped for important roles in serious startups, and those who get funded. At least in New York, most come from finance. Tech has as much prestige-whoring as finance (see: Clinkle, which is Stanford Welfare at its worst). The difference is that tech denies it. There&#x27;s a lot of passive-aggressive cattiness in the hot startups and credibility really matters, despite what people say. The claimed meritocracy is code for &quot;don&#x27;t question my decisions&quot; (whereas bankers will, at least, admit that they screen on pedigree because there are just so many applicants and it is impossible to evaluate them on deeper criteria). Finance, if you can get in, is a great way to get that credibility. Remember that the people who actually matter in Silicon Valley are the VCs, most of whom did the IBD -> B-school route. It shouldn&#x27;t be this way, but people who got into VC from technology are extremely rare-- they&#x27;re only let in <i>after</i> winning the startup lottery, in which case their VC jobs are victory laps to give them something to do, rather than jobs they actually need.<p>Also, the bubble world that the VCs have created will have dissipated by the time you are in position to take advantage of it. There will still be a lot of work in true technology; there&#x27;s perennial demand for smart, passionate people who can work hard. Real technology isn&#x27;t &quot;cool&quot; but it is always real. But the VC darlings-- the hypersocial anal vibrator app companies whose pimple-faced executives get profiled on TechCrunch and Valleywag-- and the &quot;scene&quot; surrounding them will probably be well into decline by mid-2015.<p>In short, I think you might have &quot;grass is greener&quot; syndrome.<p>That said, investment banking hours (for IBD analysts) are truly horrible, so I sympathize. Having hyper-networking douchebag co-workers (&quot;those who synergize&quot;) is not enviable either. There are plenty of sane, 10-7 financial jobs where you&#x27;ll have decent co-workers, even in the front office, but the IBD track is not going to lead that way, and those are not the prestigious or high-paying routes.<p>There&#x27;s somewhat of a silver lining, which is <i>why</i> the hours in IBD are so bad: the structure of the workflow during the day. People delegate out the door, and everything has a tight deadline, so analysts are getting their work (due next morning) around 4-6pm. Analysts are shift-workers who have to show up 7 hours early, but there is a lot of down time during that period that people spend avoiding additional work so they are ready to play from 4pm to 2am. If you have the energy, you can learn programming in that down time. This does mean that you&#x27;re actually working 2 jobs as opposed to working one but the hours of 2 (like most analysts). Of course, anything you plan on actually using must be on your own time and resources; but most of your projects in the first year or two you are just for learning.<p>You should learn programming. Like they say about trading, if you get the opportunity when you&#x27;re young, you should take it because (a) you&#x27;ll learn a lot, (b) you might be really good, and (c) if you are good, it&#x27;s a lot of fun and (sometimes) handsomely rewarded.<p>Still, I&#x27;m not sure that giving up the insta-credibility that comes with banking pedigree is worth it. The software industry has no safety net at all (and don&#x27;t get some macho delusion; that&#x27;s not a good thing). Software companies fire good engineers for political reasons that would never fly in banking or law (rule 1: don&#x27;t fuck with a lawyer, not even a 26-year-old junior) with zero severance and often not even a good reference. Why do startups get away with that nonsense? Because a lot of software engineers are pussies who won&#x27;t fight for themselves. When banks lay people off, they announce that they are cutting personnel and that protects the reputation of those let go, and they offer severance. When tech companies have layoffs, they usually pretend it&#x27;s a &quot;low performer initiative&quot; and humiliate people with PIPs (which means there will be no severance, and usually not the guaranteed good reference either) instead of just admitting that business is rough. Again, they get away with that because most engineers are pussies who don&#x27;t fight for themselves.<p>Good software engineers (top 3-5%) are treated well after a while, but you have to get high-quality work to get good and it takes years. Average software engineers get no respect, mediocre pay, and no investment by management in their career advancement or opportunities to get better. Getting high-quality work in software is a crapshoot-- for every one working on compiler architecture or machine learning or R&D, there are 10 in this industry working on line-of-business apps with minimal autonomy. You have to fight for yourself to get good projects and when you&#x27;re young, usually this means changing jobs a lot (but after you&#x27;ve had 7 jobs in 6 years, getting back into finance is extremely challenging, because banks don&#x27;t like &quot;job hoppers&quot;).<p>What might be a good option for you, if you can get it, is a position in venture capital, given your interests in finance and technology. Unfortunately, most Sand Hill Road VCs are dickheads so getting a VC job out of college, even if you&#x27;re brilliant, is impossible unless you&#x27;re coming from Stanford. But you might be able to learn the ropes in less of a brand-name firm, or outside of SV, and then get an MBA. People rip on MBAs here, and that&#x27;s mostly because we get stuck with the bad ones in startupland. Good MBAs (who are actually intelligent) end up working on billion-dollar deals or at statistical arbitrage desks, while the VP/HR who tries to institute stack ranking in a 77-person startup was at the taint-bottom of his class and is almost certainly a complete failure at life who cries while he masturbates (but, sadly, still has power over you if you are an employee of that 77-person startup).<p>I don&#x27;t want to turn you off from technology. Becoming adept at it is an investment that, over time, pays off handsomely. And the work can be extremely rewarding. And it&#x27;s one of the few domains in which one can make use of very high (140+ IQ) intelligence. But the road to get credibility is hard as hell and (to be blunt) you probably won&#x27;t get good projects in Silicon Valley given that you come from a public school-- except possibly Berkeley, but even that&#x27;s a stretch. (If you can find a job locally, or in a talent-hungry emerging tech hub like Austin, Portland or Baltimore, your odds are much better.) Keep learning and investing into your technical knowledge.<p>Okay, that&#x27;s a huge brain dump, and not even 1/10th of what I could say on this, but I sincerely hope this helps. Technology is a good field, but I want to make it clear that, for most people, the grass isn&#x27;t greener than it will be if you can get a good job in finance. If you&#x27;re going to do tech, you better be laser-focused on becoming <i>extremely</i> good at it, and you&#x27;ll probably face managerial headwinds to your career advancement and learning in your first 5 years because even though the best tech companies are probably the best overall companies, <i>most</i> tech companies are crap. Banking is the safer route that confers credibility even if you are average in success level, which most people are.",1384099097

Visual Studio 6 all the way to Visual Studio 2010 had god awful C++ support outside of what Microsoft wanted to offer. With 2012 and now 2013 things are a hell of a lot better. Check out Microsoft&#x27;s GoingNative 2013 stuff.<p>As for C it is a great language but it is pretty much only for either old stuff or system level stuff. In the real world I see people pick C++ over C if possible.",1384098802

But I&#x27;m curious to to what you think &quot;let it be natural&quot; actually means.<p>We can immediately discount a nave timeline of events. Say events will appear in the timeline when they originally happen that&#x27;s not going to work, because it&#x27;s be buried within an hour or two, regardless of the importance.<p>Maybe events&#x27; places in the timeline could be based on when they were last &quot;updated&quot;, as in liked, commented on etc.  that&#x27;s probably more appropriate, but raises prioritisation questions. And let&#x27;s say somebody catches up after a week, and comments on an older status - does everybody need to see it again?<p>So something more complex is required - the simple timeline&#x27;s no longer appropriate, even in relatively straightforward cases, given the volume of friends that many users have. It seems pretty obvious then to build something like a friend graph, with edges weighted based on e.g. frequency of interaction and mutual friend count, and use that to weight news items. As far as I know, that&#x27;s what Facebook is doing.<p>Personally, I do prefer the simple timeline  but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been using Facebook since it was first available at my university, and I don&#x27;t have a huge friend list. But I appreciate that&#x27;s probably not applicable to most users, and when I do look at my news feed, it does seem to do a pretty good job of prioritising things I&#x27;m interested in - especially if you engage a little bit and downrank/hide posts that you don&#x27;t want to see.",1384098792

All the brouhaha about the H-1B visa is direly misplaced; the tournament is on the other court : outsourcing via remote employment. There are a ridiculous number of job sites that advertise remote jobs, and a good number of employers are able to get themselves to trust remote employees enough to reap the cost benefits.

In any society, there is a risk that some people are crazy and murderous. The solution to this is not a battle, but a hospital: care better for the crazy, and the they are far less likely to shoot up their neighbourhood. Negating that risk through a &quot;battle for intelligence&quot; is like negating the risk of bullying at school by installing a constantly monitored camera on every pupil&#x27;s shoulder and electrocuting any transgressors. It may work, superficially, but it ain&#x27;t the right solution. The cost isn&#x27;t worth the benefit.<p>This addresses internal crazies. What about the external ones who want to destroy America? Same difference. Instead of fighting an endless war, ask why they are trying to &quot;destroy America&quot; in the first place, and fix that. While I do not condone terrorists in any way, the US has a deeply hypocritical foreign policy, and has had that for well over half a century. Change that, consistently for another half a century, and miraculously the hatred against America will vanish.<p>So the problem begins with your assertion that there is any &quot;battle for intelligence&quot; with a worthwhile definition, let alone one that requires &quot;tremendous secrecy and daring&quot;. There isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s all a paranoia in your and your compatriots&#x27; heads.<p>Which funnily enough, is precisely the point of the article.",1384098163

Some of them are in this bill, and some of them can be made available to the public.

If Congress isn&#x27;t capable of providing the oversight they tasked themselves to do with the resources they have, then they need to either gather the resources they need or appoint another group to conduct oversight in a manner that can effectively ensure to the public that the NSA is gathering valid foreign intelligence and nothing else.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/47-prominent-technologists-nsa-review-panel-we-need-better-technical-oversight"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/47-prominent-technolog...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/29/us-usa-security-nsa-idUSBRE99S03N20131029"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/29/us-usa-security-ns...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.c-span.org/Events/Intel-Officials-Discuss-Proposed-Changes-to-NSA-Spying-Programs/10737442346-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.c-span.org/Events/Intel-Officials-Discuss-Propose...</a> (jump to about 01:34:00)",1384096606

So I ask: is Java worth learning for web development (scalability, lines of code, etc)? If not, why?",1384096330

It&#x27;s the essential question in classic political philosophy from The Republic to Machiavelli and everything that came after.<p>It&#x27;s not enough to simply repeat the ancient truism that &quot;power and fear are dangerous,&quot; which should be axiomatic by now, particularly coming from a German point of view, which has spent the last half-century-plus contemplating that exact question, from the point of view of having quite dramatically been both oppressed and oppressor in that time frame.<p>The broad question that needs to become visible and widely discussed in American politics right now is both classic and novel, and quite frankly we need help in guiding this discussion:<p>The classic question that needs to be resurfaced is, how does the US become self-conscious and more transparent about the specific boundaries we draw between protecting order and establishing liberty?<p>The novel question in the new post-9/11 context is how to manage that same balance in the ongoing battle for intelligence which by definition requires tremendous secrecy and daring.<p>It&#x27;s clear that many both in and outside the US are profoundly uncomfortable with the current state of NSA surveillance and I agree. But what <i>is</i> an appropriate level of surveillance? How can US citizens take back control of that conversation and make deliberate decisions about that kind of society we want to be?<p>And that&#x27;s really the underlying problem that I think the Speigel article was simplistically, indirectly getting at: citizens in the US no longer have the democratic power to make those decisions. But in order for the governing powers to trust democratic processes to make those policies, we need to become self-aware and articulate enough to advocate those policies, and bring up leaders that energize and focus that discussion with real statesmanship.<p>Statesmanship! Where is it? Can it exist in the current broken and polarized political environment?<p>To the degree that we still have some democratic processes in place we are responsible to say more than just, &quot;Snowden is right!&quot; We have to know what kind of society we actually want to be in this new context.<p>The enemies and threats are new, but the questions are ancient. We have not yet adapted old answers to the new context. And for that we need not only novel political theoretical solutions, but the strong statesmanship to apply them.",1384096301

But without help of IDE and easy way to debug, there is no way we can use any great language. Language on itself is useless. We need tools to be able to use it.

Overcommit yourself to it for a little bit, beyond your coursework. You can try to fix a bug in an open source product you use. You can volunteer your time for a startup in your area, and try to learn the ropes. Just start building. If you can make it clear that you&#x27;re the type of person that will dive in head first to a tough problem and find a way to scrap together a solution, you <i>will</i> put yourself in demand in the tech world.<p>Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any advice.",1384095652

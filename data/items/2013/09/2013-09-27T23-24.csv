Also it seems the guy was present and only renting out a room during the guest&#x27;s stay which allowed him to get off on a technicality in this case while many Airbnb renters will rent the entire space during vacation times, etc.",1380326340

6460288,comment,6457801,6457801,3,0,strlen,,,"Very interesting post. I often took &quot;product sense&quot; to be magic, I did not really understand what was it that made iPhone soar in sales when it introduced very little over a Nokia S-series I had at the time and didn&#x27;t even have a keyboard. Reasoning alone did not suffice: I could explain success of OS X (a UNIX that ran on commodity-ish hardware that &quot;just worked&quot; -- I did not have to rebuild my kernel to get a WiFi card to function!), the iPod (ease of iTunes/ITMS/using a large hard-disk instead of a 128mb 
flash...), but not the iPhone.<p>When I (reluctantly) went to pick up an iPhone 3GS two years after the first iPhone&#x27;s release, I began to &quot;get it&quot; -- it wasn&#x27;t about a feature matrix, but the quality (including visual) of the features it did have and (most importantly) the way these features played together. Within minutes of having an iPhone I was able to use capabilities that my Nokia phone claimed to have, but that I have never found particularly useful/usable. Technically I could use cut-and-paste to share articles from the web browser on my phone via email, but I never did (but I began doing it daily on the iPhone!); technically, I could I could run apps on the Nokia but the only third party app I remember loading was Google Maps, etc...<p>iPhone was far from the first smart phone, but it &quot;democratized&quot; use of smart-phone as a smart-phone: while it was still a toy largely for the well-to-do, it was no longer a toy solely for a small fraction of well-to-do technical intelligentsia.<p>I could apply reasoning to retroactively conclude that &quot;yes, iPhone is a great product&quot;; however, it would take intuition to guess that right off the bat or much less formulate what features would be vital to a consumer smartphone. The popular image is that intuition is compartmentalized, innate, and unreachable to training, practice, or (especially!) learning. I suspect the reality is that talent does play a huge role (there&#x27;s no way around it), but it is possible to deliberately cultivate at least some forms of intuition.<p>That said, what&#x27;s even more amazing is when one develops a sense of gamechanger/show-stopper/distraction intuition about a topic that&#x27;s not in their domain of expertise. There&#x27;s an anecdote that when Steve Jobs visited Xerox Parc and met Alan Kay in the late 70s/early 80s he remarked that OO will be hugely important to future of programming. What I find amazing about this is:<p>1) Steve Jobs was not a software engineer, much less a PL wonk<p>2) In hind-sight the remark is obviously true<p>3) It wasn&#x27;t a foregone conclusion in the 1980s, even among programmers. Smalltalk and CLOS were seen as crazy ideas in the 1980s, who knew that in 20 years large bulk (if not majority) of programming would be done in an IDE, in object oriented languages that run under virtual machines... Image based persistence was seen as one part of Smalltalk (and some Lisps) legacy that would never take off, but with user-accessible file system going away in iOS I am not so sure...<p>tl;dr Intuition about products in a specific industry can certainly be cultivated and learned (with hard work), but intuition about unknown (even if interrelated) product industries (or concepts) still feels &quot;magical&quot;.",1380326219

(Though it&#x27;s not much of an incentive unless those other agendas have a realistic chance at political power.) But it&#x27;s not an incentive for scientists to be more objective; it&#x27;s only an incentive for them to be biased in a different direction.<p><i>while as a group researchers benefit from belief in global warming, an individual researcher could do very well from finding convincing evidence against global warming</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure they could; at any rate, I think it&#x27;s a matter of opinion, and opinions are going to vary widely.<p><i>These are all reasons why in spite of this bias the conclusions of mainstream researchers are probably valid</i><p>No, they&#x27;re not. None of these reasons have <i>anything</i> to do with whether the mainstream conclusions are valid. That was my original point in this subthread: to know whether or not the conclusions are valid, you have to actually look at the data and the arguments based on the data. Trying to figure it out by looking at who is biased how doesn&#x27;t count.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a bait and switch here regarding what &quot;mainstream conclusions&quot; we are supposed to accept.

Both of those claims strike me as fairly obvious.<p>Are we supposed to accept that (3) the IPCC&#x27;s predictions of what the climate will be like in 2100 are reasonable? I don&#x27;t think anybody knows enough about how the climate works to say that.<p>Or are we supposed to accept that (4) we have a planetary emergency and if we don&#x27;t take drastic action now to keep the climate from changing, we are all doomed? I think that&#x27;s wrong, and worse, it&#x27;s dangerous, because acting on this recommendation will squander huge amounts of resources that could be better spent on (a) bringing more people out of poverty, and (b) making it easier for the entire world to adapt to change (climate or otherwise).<p>Much of the furor over climate change is people talking past each other: people who hold opinions like the ones I&#x27;ve just expressed on #3 and #4 are accused of denying #1 and #2, while people who are only trying to argue for #1 and #2 are accused of arguing for #3 or #4.

That would open up former hotels as new apartments.<p>The possible increase in flexibility and therefor efficiency is more likely to lower rental costs across the city, and increase income opportunities when apartments have a room to rent.",1380325433

6460219,comment,6459457,6459457,5,0,msimpson,,,"Dude, What&#x27;s with the Lack of Knowledge<p>I&#x27;ve been in the Web business for over a decade.<p>The original Heavy Cat Multimedia company site was likely not part of the first 200 sites to go live on the Web. Search engines then did not have the analytics results to prove this because that&#x27;s all there was. Yeah. They&#x27;ve been around for a bit. They just weren&#x27;t the first site with a background color other than gray.<p>During that time, I&#x27;ve learned a few things. One of them is that probably half of Heavy Cat&#x27;s competition soared to amazing heights by building &quot;cool&quot; Web sites to market their products. The reason is pretty simple. HTML is designed to present text and the occasional image. When you spend money and time to try to make it do more than that: innovation is born.<p>CSS is not intuitive. The only reason most people don&#x27;t complain more about it is because they learn to use it. HTML is not intuitive either, but at least it&#x27;s easy to learn once you realize there&#x27;s a Box Object Model. JavaScript is very useful, and also pretty amazing. You can spend days, weeks and months cramming them together in new and innovative ways and ultimately you&#x27;ll end up with a lot of well spent time and a site made of unique functionality and the occasional video.<p>You know those sites with the long lists of  really amazing-looking Web designs? Funny how all those links go to prosperous sites with a link trying to sell you the products they&#x27;ve created.<p>DOS was the same way. It was a simple, quick shell and file system for PCs. It took a couple of stone cold geniuses years to make the DOOM engine. Why? DOS wasn&#x27;t designed for that. Which is why they made it in C with their own graphics library and only hooked into the system APIs they needed. All the DOOM engine parts had to be invented from scratch.<p>I have decided after over a decade that I&#x27;m tired of trying to make bad developers understand the abilities of the Web. HTML is amazing and full of possibilities. It can be molded like clay into beautiful creations. That&#x27;s it.<p>Here&#x27;s a pro-tip from a seasoned veteran of Web development: if you&#x27;re going to write an article flaming Web technologies, learn to capitalize Web and JavaScript correctly. And, more seriously, never use markup as a high level imperative language.<p>Now I do get some benefits from doing Web sites this way. One, it&#x27;s simple and easy to update with the advent of modern technologies like content management systems. Two, it&#x27;s not cluttered with distractions like all the incoherent blog articles. Three, they load ultra fast when you keep scalability in mind. Why look at that! We&#x27;ve solved all the problems most &quot;shitty&quot; Web sites have, at a portion of the profit they generate!<p>Think about all the most popular, successful Web sites. Google. Craigslist possibly, YouTube -- I mean Google. Facebook. Twitter. Even Apple&#x27;s  company site. What do they all have in common? Mountains of servers, load balancers, support staff, etc. to preserve up time and availability. There&#x27;s animation, video, color backgrounds, textures, window decorations, animated drop-down menus, sound in general, gimmicks like games and apps, gizmos like Google&#x27;s widgets or gew-gaws (whatever that may be). They are all complex and functional, and those six Web sites -- well more like four -- together represent about <a non-verified, completely shot from the hip> dollar amount value.<p>Simplistic and forgotten. That&#x27;s what Heavy Cat&#x27;s site is going to be. They have a lot of information, if you can consider seven main pages to be &quot;a lot&quot;. They have a choice. They can spend six months building a gee-whiz site, or they can build more marginally profitable products. They chose the products.<p>They use Flash too, as a final insult. You know why they use Flash? Because it&#x27;s the only thing they learned how to use. The tools integrate well into their established workflow and they interoperate well with all the tools designed by the exact same software firm (somehow). They allow them to make graphics, music, voices and games look and sound good. As they should, with the monthly subscription costs.<p>Someday Heavy Cat might use HTML5 too. But Flash had a 16-year death, so they&#x27;re going to use what doesn&#x27;t work with the majority of the world. If you are on an Apple phone, or just don&#x27;t want to run Flash, their site will look even shittier. If you want to look at their Flash stuff, bend to their will.<p>They also no longer care about SEO, so you won&#x27;t see their Web pages on any search engines much. Searching for anything but &quot;Heavy Cat&quot; directly yields no results referencing their site.<p>Matt",1380325077

It&#x27;s all about the Lawrence Livermore SDI scandals and then the process of them getting NIF, so I read up on the historical background.<p>I was a little flabbergasted at the overall progress of the laser fusion research program: apparently back in the early &#x27;70s, the first LANL people predicted that you could achieve laser fusion with just 1kj of input. Millions were spent, ignition was nowhere near, so they got funding for another, bigger laser, which failed too, so they got funding for more lasers, and those failed too, so they got funding for an even bigger multi-billion dollar laser called NIF, and not only has that failed to reach ignition once as promised - despite going up to 1.7mj (quite a long way from 1kj) - LANL managed to run over budget by at least 400% and took something like a decade longer to finish NIF than promised!",1380324474

Twitter. Even Apple&#x27;s company site. What do they all have in common? Text and the occasional image. There&#x27;s no animation, video, color backgrounds, textures, window decorations, animated drop-down menus, ambient sound, background music, gimmicks, gizmos or gew-gaws.</i><p>Let&#x27;s see:<p>Google: Currently has a game on the homepage. Certainly could be considered a `gimmick, gizmo, or gew-gaw.`<p>YouTube: Obviously has video, some fancy modals can be found by hovering over certain things, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a ton that I am missing.<p>Facebook: The site is built on databases, JavaScript, and other technologies the author apparently considers `slow, buggy nonsense`. Where do you think all those user images are stored? Chat certainly requires either AJAX or Websockets (I have not checked).<p>Twitter: OK, we are closer to `text and images`. Still, these guys released Bootstrap <a href=""http://getbootstrap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getbootstrap.com/</a> which changed the web -- obviously huge proponents of CSS. I think the understanding today is -- even if you are not a designer/front-end developer, it is unacceptable to deliver work without minimal styling, since you can throw Bootstrap on something with little effort. Do you prefer plain browser styled inputs to that? Twitter also has a ton of infrastructure underneath that &#x27;simple&#x27; 140-character messaging &#x27;social network&#x27;.<p>Apple: <a href=""http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/</a> Enough said.<p>--<p>And finally, the comment `Here&#x27;s a pro tip from a seasoned veteran of web development: if you want to do something really remarkable on a computer, you don&#x27;t write it in HTML.

Your essay appears to be a rant on why, you think, the web sucks. I get it, most of the technologies we use are somehow dependent on C (CPython, most databases, OS). So, we are standing on the shoulders of giants. Those libraries written in C enable us. What does that have to do with the average web developer doing something remarkable? Most of us will never have to deal with the scaling problems of Facebook, Twitter, etc. Python is fast enough for me. Ruby is fast enough for most Rails users. If I ever need more performance, perhaps I will look into Go. The key point is `if`. I&#x27;m not going to start a new web project in `C`, when modern languages and frameworks ease the level of effort to write the code, and contain features I would otherwise have to re-implement.<p>You sure you aren&#x27;t trollin`?",1380323833

Before I begin building something I personally pitch at least 30 potential customers (excluding my network of friends/peers), and then follow up with a few questions. Consumer facing ideas are usually easier for me to validate than Enterprise or Business facing ideas, simply because it&#x27;s easier to round up Consumers. What I&#x27;m basically doing is getting a feel for how people react to the idea (positive / negative). The follow up questions help me determine if I missed something and/or how valuable the idea might be. A successful validation usually results in positive feedback that I can document. A very successful validation results in actual customers, or people willing to pay for it on the spot (which HAS happened). This is something I continue to do while the Product is being built, and even after the Product is released.",1380322980

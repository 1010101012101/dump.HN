8156976,comment,8154730,8154730,2,0,jessriedel,,,"> After the plaintiffs’ lawyers took their 25 percent cut, the settlement would have given about $4,000 to every member of the class.<p>> Judge Koh said that she believed the case was stronger than that, and that the plaintiffs’ lawyers were taking the easy way out by settling. The evidence against the defendants was compelling, she said.<p>Can anyone explain this from the perspective of the economic/sociological motivations of the lawyers?  People often complain about a huge chunk of the money going to the class-action lawyers who are too eager to settle, but the traditional argument is that a fixed percentage structure (rather than an hourly or flat rate) gives the lawyers the proper incentive to pursue the interests of the class by tying their compensation directly to the legal award.<p>Here&#x27;s my best guess: Lawyers, like most people, are risk adverse for sufficiently large amounts of money.  (They would rather have $10 million for sure than a 50% chance at $50 million.)  On the other hand, the legal award will be distributed over many more plaintiffs.  Since it will be much smaller per person, the plaintiffs are significantly less risk adverse.  So the lawyers settle even thought it&#x27;s not in the best interests of the plaintiffs.<p>This suggests the following speculative solution for correctly aligning the incentives of the lawyers and the class action plaintiffs: either (a) spread the legal work over many lawyers such that the potential compensation for them is small enough that their utility function is at least as linear as the plaintiffs or (b) turn the class-action lawsuits legal team into a corporation which must answer to many shareholders.<p>Proposal (a) has problems because it might require the number of lawyers to be comparable to the number of plaintiffs, which could be thousands or millions.  Proposal (b) strikes many people as weird, and introduces other principal-agent problems, but it does have precedence:<p><a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/30/looking-to-make-a-profit-on-lawsuits-firms-invest-in-them/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/04/30/looking-to-make-a-pro...</a><p>Would love to hear an expert opinion on this.",1407595473

The members of the class want compensation and justice. The lawyers want to be paid.  And a larger group, ranging from engineers who are not part of the class to the public in general, wants to be sure that a small group of powerful CEOs and other inside players don&#x27;t collude illegally against the workforce.<p>The lawyers are obviously very risk averse.  They have a crack at a huge amount of money, virtually guaranteed as long as they settle.  It&#x27;s so much money that the would rationally accept a small fraction of the possible win at trial.<p>The class wants compensation, but the individual cut is small enough that there is probably more incentive to go to trial.  If someone offered me 50 million or a 70% chance at 300 million, I&#x27;d hesitate.  Really.  Because there isn&#x27;t that big a difference in my life between those two numbers - in a way, it&#x27;s a choice between a life guaranteed free from any financial worry, or merely a good chance of it.  But remove a bunch of zeroes, offer me 5,000 or a 70% chance at 30,000, and I&#x27;d take the latter.  This, I think, represents the difference between the lawyers and the class (and it&#x27;s why so many people think the whole approach is broken and should be handled by a federal or state prosecutor).<p>Lastly, of course, there is the use of litigation as a way to pry information out of companies that would prefer to keep it quiet. While the public may in general not have a specific stake in this, everyone has an interest in preventing collusion.  This class, as it stands to gain nothing but information, would probably take the highest risk approach.  They&#x27;d like to see a heavy penalty, but most important to them is the litigation itself and the information that comes to light.<p>I&#x27;m in the third group, so obviously I&#x27;m happy to see this.  But my guess is that a lot of the engineers in the class would prefer a higher risk strategy as well.  Money in compensation is nice, but most of the engineers affected here are probably reasonably successful financially, but they must be pretty angry, with the companies and with this settlement.",1407593444

I fancy that I can hear your voice as I read your words, and having a voice is something many writers never achieve.<p>I strongly recommend that you write every day, even if only for your own purposes and even if you dispose of what you have written. Regardless of your industry or vocation, the ability to express yourself, to express complex thoughts cleanly and clearly, will serve you well the rest of your days.",1407592815
